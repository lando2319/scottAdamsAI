good morning ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to the best damn thing that's
ever going to happen to you in your
whole life
until tomorrow it's called coffee with
scott adams it's a international
phenomenon
it's changing the world every day in big
and small ways and
aren't you happy you're part of it yeah
of course you are
and
if you'd like to take it up to the
ultimate level and i know that's the
kind of people you are
if you don't mind me saying
i do notice that my live stream audience
is smarter and sexier than other people
it'd be great if you don't brag about
that in front of the others
it's just something we keep keep to
ourselves okay
but if you want to take it up another
level to get your sexiness to the
maximum potential all you need is a
copper mug or glass a tanker chelsea
steiner can't take jugger flask a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite beverage
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here today thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip you can hear the echo
in my coffee cup go
well
uh
like i say
there are some days
when there's just nothing you can do
with the headlines they're just not
serving up anything that you can work
with
but that's not today
let me tell you
today is headline goodness we get all
kinds of good let's start with
arnold schwarzenegger
uh in a four
four car crash he's fine uh there was a
woman who had some uh on her head but i
think she'll be fine
so no serious injuries
but
i have to connect these two stories i
just have to
uh arnold schwarzenegger as you might
know he's very pro
proactive in climate change and so he
says he wants the world to do a lot more
to fight climate change
in unrelated news schwarzenegger's suv
crushed a toyota prius yesterday
not making that up
i'm not making that up
he's one of the biggest advocates for
climate change
and his suv
crushed a toyota prius yesterday
now it was a multi-car crash
but there's actually a photo of his suv
on a prius
seriously
could that be any better
could it be any better chandler big
now
what if what have i told you about um
how to know
you have something you could work with
to write a joke
the way humorists know they can write a
joke about a topic
is if it's funny without the joke
i don't have to add anything to this
right
i literally just described it and i
didn't i didn't there was no hyperbole
no exaggeration i literally just
described it there's nothing you can add
to it it's like a complete
the simulation has provided us with a
joke
and there you go
well that was awesome
my favorite thing about biden lately is
how he keeps dissing kamala
first of all saying that she was doing a
good job
i talked about this before you do not
want to hear your boss say in public you
did a
good job
great perhaps terrific that'd be great
how about awesome
that's that's the sort of thing you want
to hear your boss say
but
good
do you know what kind of a raise you get
in corporate america if your performance
is rated as good
for those of you who don't have
corporate experience
those of you who do
please inform the others what kind of
raise you get
if your performance is
good
zero
yeah zero
because you're supposed to be good
that's just meeting expectations
right or barely
they need you to perform better than
that if you want to get a raise
so that's pretty bad but but i think he
topped it today
so he appeared with kamley harris at an
event and here's what biden said
he said hi kamala i love you
biden sandy as he opened his remarks
quote you always have my back
you're really amazing you're the best
partner i could imagine
now
correct me if i'm wrong
but is he talking about her like a lover
or a vice president
i'm going to read it again
is it a lover
or a vice president
hi kamala i love you
you always have my back
you're really amazing you're the best
partner i could imagine
that's not really about being vice
president is it
something tells me he's fantasizing that
he's in a relationship with her
or something
but
uh i i think that's a pretty good
giveaway that her role is not about her
vice president competency
can we rule that out
it does seem to be just a personal
relationship of some creepy nature
and
i
i think this is the creepiest president
vice president uh combo
can anybody top it
what is the creepiest
combination of president and vice
president we've ever seen
it's definitely the creepiest
uh did you really say this or are you
making a joke he actually said this
that i swear to god i i copied and
pasted the actual quote i'm not making
that up
see i think that's going to be the theme
today
the theme of today's show is
i'm not making that up
i'm giving it to you exactly as it
happened
that's all i need today
all right uh biden's approval
the ap of a people
uh said only 28 of americans say they
want biden to run for re-election
and only 48 of democrats
the the funniest thing about this is
i've never seen any president fail this
hard
but democrats still need to sort of
support him now i'm sure the left felt
the same way about trump supporters
there had to be some point where they
said are you still supporting this guy
so you know some of it's just
team play
but trump never had these ratings
trump never had this kind of
unpopularity or anything close to it
sonoma county
is reporting that they've tracked their
overdoses and their suicides
for the pandemic period and here's the
result
that for 2020 and 2019
there was an increase in overdoses you
already knew that fentanyl mostly
so everywhere there was an increase in
overdoses
and then
but there was a decline in suicides
so they said suicides actually went down
during the pandemic
uh drug overdoses went up do you see any
do you see any problems with those
statistics
does anything jump out at you as
a little bit of a problem with those
numbers maybe
here's the problem how do you
distinguish between an overdose and a
suicide
let me tell you something that i know
because i've lived longer than some of
you all right so everybody who's lived
at least as long as i have
you all get a pass for the for what i'm
gonna say because you already know it
you already know it
this is for people who are maybe young
or less experienced and just haven't
lived in the world enough
overdose deaths are often suicides
not maybe something they intended at
that moment
but it is a practice which has such a
high chance of killing you
that it attracts people who are suicidal
because if you're suicidal to begin with
oh i don't want to say this out loud
i almost said something really bad out
loud but i'm going to soften it i'm
going to say
people who don't have any way to find
happiness are going to find a way to
find happiness
if you have no way to be happy as far as
you can tell i mean your own mind you
think there's no way you'll still find a
way to do it
and you'll find a way to do it that
might kill you
because you don't care
so there's a very subtle difference
between all right i just don't even care
if i'm alive and actively killing
yourself
so if you're doing something that has a
real high degree chance of killing you
you know it's fun while you're doing but
it's a high chance of killing you
you might have been suicidal before you
even went down that path
now
some of this is anecdotal
but
does anybody disagree with my point
having heard it
that you really can't track these
numbers separately
agree yeah i think we agree just be
careful that when you see those numbers
separately you're not seeing what you
think you see
those are conflated numbers or it should
be
um
how many of you believe that the elites
be they devos
davos or whatever or other elites uh
have a plan or a desire to depopulate
the world
in the comments how many of you believe
there's a secret plan by the elites
to depopulate the world
i'm saying no's and yeses a mix of no's
and yeses bill gates i see
i see some knows i see some guesses some
no's yeses yeses nose all right
um there are some kinds of questions
like this where
we're all just guessing wouldn't you say
we're all just guessing on some
questions
there are other questions where
some people are guessing
but others are not
this would be one of those
this is one of those where some people
are guessing
do they really want to depopulate the
world i think they might
and other people actually know the
answer
who are the people who know the answer
how would you describe the people who
actually know the answer for sure
i want to see if you get this before i
tell you the answer
the answer is people who understand
economics
do you you might know that elon musk
who is
not dumb
says that the world needs more
population not less
what do you think of that
so elon musk is you know an elite i
guess
and he says
you need more people to keep the economy
going
not fewer
let me let me tell you what a hundred
percent of the people who understand
economics belief 100
this would be one with no exceptions
a hundred percent of the people who
understand economics
want more people
100
there's no such thing as a bill gates
wanting fewer people
that's not a thing
that's not a thing at all he would never
want that because nobody smart wants
fewer people
the only way you can keep an economy
humming is with more people what's the
biggest problem that china has ahead of
it
they reduced their birth rate so that
they're going to have this this weird
bubble of
of old people and not enough young
people it's a gigantic problem
so let me tell you with a hundred
percent certainty there are no elites
who want fewer population or fewer
people
not any way that can be true there's no
way that can be true
and if you'd like to test this because
some of you are saying really
really because i've seen some things
that make me think
they do
and you might even say well why did
china
need to control its
population well they had a specific
problem
the specific problem was they couldn't
feed them
right
if you can't feed everybody
you got to do something drastic but you
can see that even in that drastic
situation they created a longer term
problem that
is its own problem that's pretty big
but unless you're in that situation
where you're going to starve to death in
the united states is certainly not
you know europe doesn't seem to be
starving right if you're not starving
you want more people
and indeed this is one of the reasons
and i don't know if i've ever said this
out loud but let me say it
specifically
one of the reasons i'm less opposed to
immigration
and now i don't like illegal immigration
i think we're on the same page with that
but
i'm not as opposed to immigration as a
concept as long as it's legal
than many of you
because
you have to have them it's basically a
strategic advantage over china
you know
their economy is going to have a problem
but we'll probably be shipping in
immigrants forever
and china really can't handle that can
they
china can't really ship in immigrants i
mean not in the same way that we can
they they don't integrate as well
so
um
have i convinced anybody if i haven't
convinced you
then i would like to say talk to
somebody who understands economics that
you believe understands economics so if
you still think that the elites want to
decrease the population just find
somebody with a degree in economics
and say generally speaking
would rich people be better off or worse
off
with bigger or smaller population
now there's there's a related question
which is the rate of growth right
the rate of growth
i can imagine that the elites would want
to control
why
why would the elites want to control the
rate of growth but not the growth itself
because the rate of growth could make a
difference
but you always want growth you just
wanted a controlled growth you want
everything controlled right
it's like everything you need to put it
in the right amount
so that's my uh economic lesson and i've
told you before that
if your talent stack as i like to say
includes economics you can see around
corners
because people who have an economics
background can just
see obviously
or just obvious stuff
that if you haven't studied economics
you wouldn't see it all i'm going to
give you another example this as we go
of something that if somebody did not
study economics they would make the
mistake that you're going to see coming
up all right we'll get to that
um
so it looks like intel's going to put 20
billion dollars into building a
chip factory the size of a village
in the united states
i am so happy about that now biden did
say we're looking to you know bring our
chips into the united states and that's
the thing we've got to do first right
you got to bring your key technologies
back first
i would have not really a big problem
allowing china to be the place where
they make our fortune cookies
and our cheap american flags the plastic
ones
and
little cheap goods that are like
knick-knacks and stuff if china wants to
be in the knick-knack manufacturing
business
that's okay
i don't want them to make our chips
i don't want them to you know control
the uh the rare earth minerals and stuff
like that
i don't want them to have our software
and our
high tech
but if they want to make knickknacks and
cheap plastic stuff that we buy that's
okay they can keep doing that
so i do think that the bringing our key
businesses back to the united states
i think that's going to have some legs i
think that's going to happen
the the important
now a lot of you know that since the
pandemic began
my
my record of predictions has been much
better than the professionals and the
doctors
now some of you don't believe that if
you're not familiar with the body of my
work on the pandemic you're saying to
yourself what
i heard you say something wrong well you
probably didn't
you probably heard something out of
context or incomplete
most of most of people's opinions about
me are not even close to accurate but
for example the reason that i beat the
doctors and the experts so consistently
is that the only things i had an opinion
on were the things that were they were
obviously lying
so i just kept my predictions to things
where they're obviously lying
and then you know you look like a genius
but this fooled some people into
thinking that i might be as qualified as
a doctor and some of my critics are
actually asking for advice
one of my critics you might say he's
being sarcastic but i'd like to treat
this as uh serious
uh one of the users on twitter named
kathmandu
do spell d-o-o
he says dr adams
dr adams
what do you suggest i do for this
painful rash on my balls
thanks as always for your educated
opinion
well
i would like to generalize my advice
now this would be for all of my critics
for any of my critics if you have a
painful rash on your balls
my advice
stop licking them
just stop licking them
come back to me in a week and we'll see
if that resolved it
now if you could tell me that your
professional doctor could give you
better advice than that
i don't think so i don't think so
well
here's a funny story about january 6.
there are two new pieces of information
about it and they both absolve trump
except they're being reported like it's
the opposite
because if you keep the tone a certain
way
they can say good things about trump
that absolve him
but the people watching you think the
opposite happened
i don't know if i could do an example of
that let's say
let's say trump uh saved an orphan
from certain death
cnn would report that
with the tone
once again
the president narcissist in chief had to
make a big splashy show of uh instead of
running the country instead of taking
care of business while things are going
off the rails he decides to take a
little
detour
save an orphan saving an orphan uh let's
talk about all the things he's done
financially illegally
so that that's the way cnn would cover
it there's nothing that trump could do
that won't get the tone
of bad coverage but here's here's the
new stuff
so apparently the january 6 committee
and then politico got a hold of it there
was some draft executive order
in which uh it was suggest the the
executive order if signed
would have allowed i guess the
department of defense to seize voting
machines and name a special counsel to
probe the 2020 elections
now if you're if you're asking the
military
to seize the voting machines to protect
them
and then you you have a special counsel
who would be independent from whoever
appointed that person
um you know allegedly independent
um
is that not a very direct statement that
they genuinely believe the election was
fraudulent
now let me make a distinction
as
uh trump's critics have said and this is
a reasonable this is a reasonable uh
claim
they they said you know this executive
order it looks like
they believe the election was fraudulent
but their real motive
in their head
the one they didn't tell you the one
that's only in their head but their
critics can see from a distance the real
motive in their head
was that they didn't think the election
was fraudulent and they were really just
going to use this to keep power and then
figure out a way to keep it permanently
now can you rule that out
is there anything that would rule out
the hypothesis
that the secret intention
was to just keep power and not to check
that the vote was correct
right
but here's the thing
the only thing that's in evidence
the only thing that's written
or has any kind of
testimony completely absolves them
because the only thing written
very clearly indicates
a belief that the election was
fraudulent
that doesn't mean it's true
it doesn't mean that's what they were
secretly thinking in their minds
but the only evidence we have
very consistently shows that they
believe the
the vote was fraudulent
now wouldn't that be exculpatory because
that's the opposite of an insurrection
an insurrection would be you're trying
to take over illegally
what this eo indicates
is that there was at least the thought
that was popular enough that somebody
could write up in the eo there was a
common thought
that there was an actual problem
and they were trying to fix it
now i think that that was based on you
know
cognitive dissonance probably the the
thought that trump thought he couldn't
have possibly lost
if everything was copacetic
he might not be wrong about that by the
way
because i had the same feeling i don't
see how he lost
but
you know like like the critics have said
we have not seen evidence or at least i
haven't seen evidence of massive fraud
doesn't mean it didn't happen
because we're not allowed to look for it
at least in the technology parts so
here's the first interesting thing that
the evidence of bad intention would be
entirely based on mind reading
the evidence of good intentions is
clearly spelled out in the document
we think the elections are sketchy
we better take a pause and make sure
that we have a clean election
so
why is that not being reported as
exculpatory why is it being reported
like
they found a smoking gun it's the
opposite
it's the opposite of a smoking gun
now
let's talk about the eo itself
if they had done this
do you imagine that everybody would have
been happy about it no
and there's question whether getting the
military involved was even even close to
being legal
but here's the thing
it was not signed
here's the thing that a lot of people
don't understand about
first drafts
in this situation if somebody comes to
the boss and says all right i got this
complicated plan
we're going to do this and this and then
this will happen and we'll do this and
this
what does the boss say
usually the boss says
write that down that's kind of
complicated
write that down
as if it were an executive order and let
me look at it in context
so it looks like somebody wrote down an
idea probably there were a lot of ideas
floating around
somebody wrote down one set of ideas of
a way to go
and then it didn't get signed
so what does that tell you
well it tells me because i used to be in
the business of writing that kind of
thing first drafts for strategies for
corporate stuff
one of the reasons you write stuff down
is to see if it still makes sense
and quite often like really often
when you go to write it down you go oh
i don't know well it looked it sounded
better in my head but now that i wrote
it down i see a hole
but also writing it down allows you to
show it to people who are smarter than
you are
probably some of them were lawyers
and probably some of the lawyers said
okay this was
interesting idea but no
no
legally speaking
no
so then they just put it away
that is called a thought crime
somebody was thinking about something
decided against it probably for the
right reasons because it wasn't legal
probably right if it had been perfectly
legal
i kind of imagined they would have done
it
because i don't know what it would have
stopped them
so you have to think that the fact that
it was illegal
is exactly why it never got signed
so
so it's a story about a process that
worked exactly right
which is somebody floated
an idea smart people looked at it said
now nope
and then they went on and did something
else that's exactly what you want
that's not a problem
now uh i wonder if they'll ever find out
who wrote that executive order
i'm guessing they will not
um
so we've got two pieces oh and then the
other
piece we got was uh there's a video of
ali alexander generally considered
because he was the organizer of the
january 6 event
and
here's what you need to know the
organizer of the event
has not been charged or even implicated
in any unlawful act
now that's not me that's i think this
was cnn reporting it so even cnn is
saying
that the organizer
was not even implicated now it would be
one thing not to be charged that
wouldn't tell you much
but even cnn says
nobody has any information that he did
anything wrong
but what is it he's being accused of
in this new charge
is being achieved accused of uh
considering
having security
at the event
that uh two cnn calls them extremist
groups
and that would be the um
the
proud boys and the oath keepers
apparently they were available or made
themselves available for security
and ali alexander was considering using
them i think that you know plan didn't
didn't exactly get executed but i think
the oath keepers did provide some
security for the event i don't know if
alexander made that happen or they just
did it
but
uh and then i guess that plan didn't
happen or at least through ali it didn't
happen
now
what do you know about the proud boys
here's one of these fake news situations
the people on the right are more likely
to know that the proud boys are people
who like to fight and drink and they go
places where that they can fight and
drink
and that the the stories about them
being racist etc there might be some
racist members
that wouldn't surprise me but they're
not really about that
like yeah they're they're it's more like
a social group
almost
now the oath keepers i know less about
them
but um
so i don't have an opinion on them
but uh
anyway so
if you're uh associated with the
political right
and these groups uh volunteered to help
keep security and you knew the security
was important i could see that they
would consider it
you know and i can see why they'd rule
it out because it might be a bad look
but i can see why they consider it
i will tell you that i once considered
the proud voice for my own security
have i ever told you that story
at one point i talked about giving a
talk in berkeley or something it was
years ago
and a member of the proud boys contacted
me and said hey we'd be happy to
give you just free security so you don't
get beaten up by the lefties in berkeley
now i didn't do the event so i didn't it
was never an issue but i have to tell
you that
at the moment
when they offered
my only my only
reaction was
oh that's a nice offer
that's about all i thought about it
in my personal case i would not take
security to an
event i would either not go
or i would go without security
but i wouldn't take security to an event
that i just wouldn't put myself in that
position
um
because i in
i could probably handle things better
than security on a minor at a minor
level i could handle it better than
somebody had brought too much muscle and
on a big level i just wouldn't be there
in the first place
anyway um let's talk about ukraine i did
a little bit of research to figure out
what the hell is going on
because i couldn't figure out what does
putin really want
and part of the problem is that we don't
agree on what putin wants
so i'm going to give you
the uh i guess
the the quick version of my
semi-deep dive here
and here are some related things about
this story that you need to know
former german chancellor uh do you
remember gerhard schroeder so he was the
german chancellor
and after he left office
and while he was in office he had
advocated working working with russia so
he was a german chancellor
who is sort of
pro work with russia
after his term
uh where did he go
uh he later joined russian oil company
rosneft as chairman
um what
did you know that
did you know that the chancellor of
germany
left the job and became the
chairman of the russian oil company
rosneft
so some of you knew that
good for you you were more informed that
i am here's another one
um
uh former french prime minister francois
philian
and former australian foreign minister
karen anisi
uh
after their after they served in their
governments
they joined the boards of russian
state-owned companies
so that's three examples of major
leaders of major companies
that left their jobs and took russian
money after they were gone
apparently that's legal
now
just keep this in mind that putin
apparently can bribe anybody to do
anything because he's got enough oil
company money and
that's a bad situation
now
we we hear that russia has a hundred
thousand troops massed at the border of
ukraine
does that sound like an invasion to you
go
100 000 troops invasion or no invasion
i'm no military expert
but let me give you some context
this was the one of the funniest tweets
that i saw today is funny because it's
true
uh somebody tweeted
just for context um how many troops did
the ussr have
versus afghanistan
did russia have a numerical advantage
in afghanistan
i think they did
the the point is
you you need a lot of troops to take
over a country and hold it
you know maybe a hundred thousand would
do a lot of a lot of damage
but if you want to take over a country
and hold it
it's not the number of troops you have
necessarily
now how many troops do you think ukraine
has so there are 100 000 who want to
attack
and of course they will be backed up by
you know many many more if they needed
to replace them or augment them
um
but how many does ukraine have
like uh 1.5 million or something like
that in the military so it's a hundred
thousand troops invading the country
with 1.5 million
and ukraine would have the freedom to
basically mass all of their forces
on their border
because russia is only going to come
through one border
so ukraine doesn't have to you know
defend its entire border because those
are friendlier countries
so i'm not sure that these numbers
suggest an evasion
is there anybody who has any military
understanding am i completely wrong
these numbers look like negotiating
numbers they don't look like invasion
numbers
but you know it's not like i'm a
military expert or something
russia's on multiple sides of ukraine
multiple sides yes but not all the sides
the the troops are apparently on one
border in particular
um
it depends on the goals yeah
so anyway to me it looks like
negotiating but i'm not the expert
um what is it you would want to
negotiate and what does he want well
here's some more background it was a
1994 agreement i don't know if you knew
about this
it was between the u.s the uk and russia
and the agreement was that
we'd all respect ukraine's sovereignty
if ukraine would give up its nuclear
arsenal and apparently it did
so ukraine gave up his nuclear weapons
to be protected by this agreement and
then that didn't work
should we ever expect anybody else to
ever give up their nuclear weapons
that's a big problem
right
if ukraine gives up its nuclear weapons
because we asked and the uk asked
and then they get taken over by russia
who was a signatory to the deal
nobody's ever going to give up nuclear
weapons again
didn't work in libya and if it doesn't
work in ukraine it's over
i would say that our biggest strategic
thing we have to protect is that if you
give away your nuclear weapons
the whole world protects you
here's what's wrong with the ukraine
situation it is framed wrong
instead of framing it as hey russia is
trying to take over
they should frame it ukraine gave up its
nuclear weapons in return for protection
russia was one of the signature
signatories the entire world
needs to stop this from happening
otherwise the problems down the road
have nothing to do with the ukraine
this is not a ukraine problem this is a
nuclear proliferation problem
don't care about ukraine don't
care about russia don't care about putin
don't care about
any of this
but if ukraine gave up nuclear weapons
and doesn't get rewarded for that big
time big reward
don't try to get anybody's nuclear
weapons away from them again north korea
do you think north korea is looking at
ukraine
hell yes
hell yes and what is what is north korea
doing right now
ramping up
their nuclear program
again because ukraine is on the verge of
proving
that dealing with people even russia
on giving up your nukes just doesn't
work
just doesn't work
the entire world needs to
protect ukraine
china needs to protect ukraine
india
needs to protect
ukraine israel needs to protect ukraine
there's no country that doesn't need to
protect ukraine because you're
protecting yourself this has nothing to
do with russia
nothing
has nothing to do with ukraine
it's about the deal
if you can't make that deal and make it
a stick you can't make any deal with
anybody ever
right
that's the deal
you gotta stop
that deal from getting broken
at all costs
all costs
am i wrong
now i don't think that we framed this
right at all all right well here's some
more information
so apparently
putin sees it as his sort of domain you
know i guess in russia ukraine has
sometimes been called little russia
because they have so much in common and
so historically
uh russia has regarded ukraine as part
of them so so you have this historical
thing where the the russians
are kind of feel like they should have
some control or at least influence right
sphere of influence at the very least
and but when the ukraine
got its
uh let's see there was a
um oh you should also know that the in
western ukraine they're generally
pro-western but on the border of russia
they're actually a little bit more
pro-russian
so there is a play where where putin
could
maybe absorb some of the pro-russian
people and get less complaints than if
he
absorbed the whole country so he's got a
lot of different plays he could do here
but uh just 15 percent of ukrainians
have a positive attitude toward uh putin
15 1 5.
so ukraine really really doesn't want to
be under
putin's
thing
and i would say that the correct frame
for ukraine is switzerland
why is it that switzerland doesn't get
attacked when there's big wars all
around it
what what is it that protects
switzerland yeah they got mountains and
they're not strategic i get that but
what else what else protects them it's
not their militia
or whatever they call it
right
the neutrality wouldn't be enough if
they were also had a strategic value
they'd probably get taken over
but
i feel like that's where we should go
with ukraine because i think putin does
have a genuine
interest in not having nato there
but i also have a genuine interest in
not having nato and ukraine that'd be
great
how about how about we don't defend
ukraine with nato how about we have some
other solution where we just switzerland
now if in switzerland would putin still
have
influence
probably because he's got lots of ways
to influence with money and bribes and
cyber attacks and all kinds of stuff
but
i feel like that's where it has to go
we shouldn't be talking about ukraine
being pro-western or pro russia
the best thing for ukraine is they can
do business with both right
though you think russia wants to do at
least financial business with russia
while doing financial business with
everybody else
just say sweden just just use the words
hey let's make ukraine sweden and let's
protect the nuclear deal because we
can't ever have a situation where
somebody gives up nukes again you know
libya
was the first case we can't ever have
that happen again that's just a zero
zero
no wiggle room there there's lots of
wiggle room and other stuff but you
can't
you you can't let a country go under if
they give up their nukes willingly you
just can't
all right um
what else we need to know about that
that's about it
there's a
new mississippi law that is either a
prank or it's legislation let's see if
you can decide
is this new mississippi law a prank
like actually a joke
or are they serious
so the context is you know there's a
critical race theory allegedly being
taught in schools
in some form not not directly
and then there are people who don't want
that so there's the battle between the
pro-critical race theory and the anti
and whether it's even being taught at
all and blah blah so that's the context
senate bill 2113 would forbid public
schools in the state from forcing
students to agree quote
that any sex race ethnicity religion or
national origin is inherently superior
or inferior
and the bill doesn't mention critical
race theory in any way
it doesn't mention it directly
and it doesn't even mention it
indirectly and indeed the bill would
just reinforce what everybody agrees
with
and the constitution would require
that you don't discriminate against any
race or ethnicity blah blah blah
now what happened when
mississippi
decided to have a law that you would not
call any race inferior
what happened
there are two black state senators
walked out
what
wait what
wait the the the two black senators in
mississippi are protesting
a law that says no one can be considered
superior or inferior
based on race
and nothing else there's nothing else in
the law
there's no other like little details or
anything
that's literally
it
so is it a prank or legislation
because it looks to me like some
mississippi uh lawmaker
figured out a way to get black people to
protest equality against equality
because that's what they did
he actually got two black state senators
to protest against the idea
of treating them equally
what did i tell you about the news today
you don't have to add any punch lines
the news the news is just doing all the
work
all the heavy lifting is the story
itself
i wanted to add something clever to it
but i didn't have anything
i've got nothing clever because i think
the story is the clever part
i think it's a prank
i'm going to go on record as saying i
think this is a prank
i don't think this was ever serious
because it didn't say anything it was
literally it was literally
proposed bill that would change nothing
because it doesn't change anything it's
the it's the existing law
which was really clever by the way
really clever if that's what they were
thinking
all right let's talk about uh february
1st being done with uh coven mandates
we've got a little action here
so the nfl and the players association
uh is going to halt daily covert testing
for the unvaccinated players
that seems like a big deal
so if you don't have a vaccination
you don't need to test
unless you have symptoms
that that seems
reasonable doesn't it under the current
data and the current situation it seems
reasonable and every time you see
somebody acting reasonable
don't you have like a don't you pause
and say
there must be part of this story
i think i'm missing something
because it seems to indicate a large
organization is doing something
perfectly reasonable and practical
there must be there's got to be some
more to this right
no i guess
maybe that's actually happening
you might actually see people
starting to do reasonable things
could happen
i tweeted a couple of graphs today
showing that the projections now
remember these are projections
for hospital and hospitalization
capacity and deaths
is supposed to just fall off a table
around february 1st
so the timing's kind of perfect
but we're going to need probably a good
solid week of death declining like
sharply
before we can get rid of the masks at
least in schools we should do schools
first
and
so you got that and then also cnn is
giving sort of endemic opinion coverage
in other words uh it's not just fox news
saying get rid of those masks and
mandates
but cnn is softening its side
by showing people say you know i think
we're moving more to an endemic
situation here
which doesn't address directly the
mandates but it does right if you're an
endemic you're probably going to drop
your mandates
so now you have the the entire left
and the entire right
uh persuading in the same direction so
let's let's get rid of these mandates
sooner than later
uh but i i still don't know if it's
enough
and i've got a
oh let's say a question not a suggestion
i'll see how you respond to it
if let's say you're in a state where
this kids have to be masked and february
first comes and you've seen other states
maybe drop mandates in other countries
and you haven't done it in your state
how tempted would you be
as a parent of a mask wearing school-age
kid
to call that kid in sick with a bad case
of
mask rash
which i don't know if that's a real
thing or not but it doesn't really
matter to the story
because
i feel like you might want to keep your
kid home at least one day
you know this the schools take a big hit
if kids don't come to school i think
there's a funding
issue i don't know the details of that
but you have to get their attention
right
now i don't know if you need two days
i don't know if you need to keep them
out two days maybe i don't know
but if
i don't know 30 percent of parents
called in and said their kids had the
bad case of mask rash
and nothing else because when you call
it a kid sick it's usually just a phone
call whether you leave a recorded
message
and i think you could crash the schools
just by calling in your kids sick with
mask rash
now i wouldn't do it any other way
because i think you should be overt
about what you're doing
if you say oh my kid you know has a
stomachache or something
yeah
i'd rather you say directly what you're
doing yeah it's a bad case of mask rash
so we got to keep them home
now i don't know if that's a good idea
or a bad idea
i'm just going to put it out there that
the the public needs to at least be
considering all of its options
uh we should be more putin like
let us take a page from uh putin as he's
dealing with ukraine
and
you can see that he uses persuasion in
every form you know physical persuasion
verbal
money everything
so we should use all of our tools to get
rid of this
these mandates
and i guess dc is going to have the big
rally on sunday that's uh
tomorrow right big dc rally i don't
think the dc rally is going to have an
impact
because a lot of the people in it are
controversial
controversial doctors etc
and another story that is too good not
to report
in pennsylvania a truck full of monkeys
overturned
the monkeys were on the way to a lab
and four of the monkeys escaped and are
on the loose
now i didn't make that up there was a
truck full of monkeys
they were on the way to a lab and four
of them got loose
now um i said that this could be a
problem if the monkeys start wearing
masks we're not we're never gonna find
them
we're never gonna find those monkeys
they'll just fit right in
a couple people said to me that i was
being very racist
in saying that
if monkeys were masks they would not be
identified
to which i said
well that's funny
because until you mentioned it i never
even thought of it in a racial context
so
was the person who never even considered
the racial context
the racist
or was it the person who imagined a
monkey in a mask and thought of a
 black person you goddamn piece
of
racist
that one's pretty clear
am i wrong
i mean that was that was crystal clear
who the racist is in that story
all right um
how many of you saw real time with bill
maher maybe you saw the clips of barry
weiss um
being sort of anti-mask anti-mandate
etc and she got it
part of the story is she got a big cheer
from the audience which was
left leaning of course
now
i have mixed feelings about this first
of all barry weiss is not
a classic
uh liberal
she still identifies as literal but you
know you if you know her work she's
she's got one foot in two worlds right
so for her to go anti-mandate is not as
big a story as you know if it were
bernie sanders or something
but still it's it's movement and still
the audience clapped
and cheered
right so regardless of her specific
situation the audience is very left and
they they agree
so that feels like a big deal
but here's
i just got two problems
i i don't know
how much this bothers you because i know
it bothers a lot of you
but i can't stand it when people who
agree with me use bad arguments
and
so i'm often accused of attacking people
on the right
for their arguments about mandates or
whatever and people i think completely
misunderstand that
i'm trying to fix your argument i'm not
trying to break it
i don't want you to be wrong
i want you to be right i want us all to
be right and get out of the masks and
get on the mandates and go on with our
lives we're on the same side
i'm telling you that you can make a
better argument than you have been
making in some cases
and barry weiss used two of the worst
arguments
to back her decision to sort of be
anti-mandate and i don't want to talk
about them too much except to say these
are the worst two of the worst arguments
one was that they promised us that the
vaccine would help us get back to normal
and then it didn't
what's wrong what is the what is the
logical problem with that argument they
promised us that the vaccines would help
us get back to normal and then clearly
they didn't
what's wrong with that
number one the data change right
right the data changed
number two
i'll bet nobody's gonna get this one fog
of war that's part of the story
oh there's something even more basic
than the fog of war
i'll just tell you because i don't i
think none of you could get it
she's valuing a sunk cost
effectively it's not a cost cost it's a
sunk cost
whatever happened in the past
this is irrelevant
it doesn't matter
what what matters is what's your
situation today
so does it matter that somebody promised
you something in the past
it shouldn't matter to your decision
today
so she's acting as though something that
happened in the past a sunk cost can't
change it there's nothing you can do
about it
somehow should inform her current
decision and it really shouldn't
that's that's a logical problem
it would be better to say
it's just true that the vaccines are not
stopping the
spread because that would be talking
about today
as soon as you add what they promised us
that's the sunk cost
that's that's gone that's yesterday it
doesn't exist it's history just what are
you working with today because your
argument is plenty good
no uh the one who says oh my god no
you're you're saying that they lied to
us the the real issue is they lie to us
say that
say that
if you said that we don't trust them and
the data is changed we need to take
control of it that'd be good but don't
say that you value
something that happened in the past has
just sunk it's gone it's it's forever
just just make the argument based on
today that's all that's better
secondly she said that
we know now that cloth masks don't work
and i think she means the the cheap
the cheap ones that i wear all the time
uh
now that's just not true
it's not been proven that they don't
work many of you saw a headline that you
thought said that right but if you read
the headline it said the headline
was misleading
the story said that they don't work as
well as and 95s
now
i think all masks are useless during
omicron
when people are vaccinated anyway right
and we know how to protect the the
vulnerable et cetera so i'm anti-mass
period no discussion no discussion
but it's simply a lie
the cloth masks have been proven not to
work there's no evidence of that there's
no evidence that they work
right
it's not been proven that they work but
it's equally true that it hasn't been
proven they don't work
there's no evidence of that
at all
it's just that they don't work as well
as n95 and they're definitely less
useful in omicron so here's my problem
she made two points that i consider just
wrong
to back the argument i agree with
and you didn't need to do that
because there's plenty of argument to
get there without without these two what
i consider both mistakes
um
jeff pilkington
had an interesting tweet from a liberal
friend now one of the reasons that
jeff is a really good follow
and he spells his first name
g-e-o-f-f
pilkington
you can find him in my twitter feed
almost every day
is that he has
he's a weird duck
meaning that he has uh equal vision on
the left and the right
which i've almost never seen
and you know i'm not sure i have it
but when he talks about the left or he
talks about the right he's almost always
free of cognitive dissonance in other
words he can actually see their
arguments
without with any without any distortion
and part of it i think is just his
experience is that he he has about equal
contact with both sides
and listens to both sides
so it's just a weird weird weird case
but his tweets are interesting because
of that because he can he can see the
whole field and there aren't many people
who can
and he has a liberal friend who whose
name shall you know he withholds but
somebody
well i won't say anymore but just a
liberal friend
who had this suggestion and i want to
run this by you his liberal friend
remember
the key to this is as a liberal friend
if i told you this story and said a
conservative senate it would mean one
thing
but this came from a liberal okay a
liberal set
trump should run with the motto quote
build back exactly the way it was
i'm leaving a strategic silence here
build back exactly the way it was
slow clap slow clap
i don't know that's just perfect
that's just perfect
now
of course you know you don't want it
exactly the way it was so it's not one
of those things that's literally true
but as a
uh as a thing that makes you go
it's really
good i don't i don't think trump would
use that
slogan but if anybody would it would be
him
right if anybody could do this it would
be trump i don't think he will but he'd
be capable how many of you have seen the
video of the so-called patriot front
doing a little video and then after the
camera is off they think they they say
some
some hitler-related stuff
how many of you saw
all right well this video
uh
is being dunked on all over the place
because it's so obviously fake
meaning that the people are so obviously
actors and not really what they present
to be that it's it's just it's just
hilarious
you have to say it
i can't really describe
how obviously fake it is you just have
to see it yourself right and the funny
thing is that we're all trained now if
you see the comments it's hilarious
i think five years ago
i don't know how many people would have
thought that was fake
what do you think
five years ago
would you have just naturally and
instantly known that was fake
or would that would you have said maybe
all kinds of people maybe maybe these
are people
so some of you would have thought it was
fake even five years ago
i think a lot of us got a lot smarter
in five years but i mean it looks super
fake
um
anyway
that
is my show for the day did i leave
anything out
um
it looked phony as hell yeah
somebody says i thought the tiki
marchers in charlottesville were fake um
i
my opinion is that that was not real i
don't believe the charlottesville march
was completely organic or organized the
way
the way we're told that nothing about
that looks real to me
once you see all these all these fakes
you know rerun your uh movie just just
reverse it a little bit and see what see
what 2018 looks like
through the eyes of 2022.
if you had any doubt about what was
going on in charlottesville
just use your 22 20 20 22 brain and
rewind the film
and look at 2018 again
it's really obvious
once you see it from today's perspective
it wasn't as obvious then
market crash oh let's talk about the
stock market
so there's a famous bubble caller who's
calling a bubble
if you had sold your stock the last time
somebody warned of a bubble crash
and then it happened
would that have been a good good move
what do you think
if if you had sold your all your stock
just when the bubble just before the
bubble would that have been a good move
well
if you got lucky
because you might you know buy it back
at the bottom and you might have luckily
timed the top and luckily time at the
bottom
but it's not a good play
so generally speaking you want to buy
and hold and you want to be able to buy
and hold long enough that you can
survive an entire bubble crash
right
so a bubble crash
would you say that's a three to five
year thing let's say
five let's say maybe five minimum but if
you can't survive a five to seven year
crash
maybe you shouldn't have stocks in the
first place
right because that's that would be the
the common thing to do
now um i think i held all of my stocks
through all of the crashes
the big and the small i think a half i'm
doing fine
um
so
the people calling the crash may be
right
they might be right
but i'm not sure it matters in the long
run
so here's a uh
here's a tip
from me on managing your stocks
if you know the whole market went down
don't check your portfolio
if you know the market went up and
they're saying hey it's a new high check
your portfolio
it might make you happy
but the last thing you want to do is
keep checking your portfolio when it's
going down
assuming you have a good mix of stocks
now it's different if you thought you
bought the wrong stocks and you were
buying individual stocks i can't help
you with that because you shouldn't have
done that in the first place but if you
have an index fund say the fortune 500
index
um
let me see if i have to do something
oh no i don't yay
so
that
is all i got for today
stupid advice that's only if you're a
100 millionaire
what is bad advice to hold on to your
stocks no that's not a millionaire
advice that's general advice
scott says scott illegal aliens cost
california 20 billion last year you
asked for a figure well thank you
so that that's an estimate of what they
cost how much did they um
add
and what did their second and third
generation add
so that would be the complete economics
if you're telling me that they cost in
the first generation but make money by
the second or the third
is that bad economics are good
i don't know
i don't know it depends how big one is
compared to the other
um
why wasn't newsome recalled because it's
a democratic state that's the whole
answer
illegal is about to cost trillions in
california in single yeah i mean
we do have a problem if we start giving
free health care away
that's going to be expensive
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you on youtube
tomorrow
