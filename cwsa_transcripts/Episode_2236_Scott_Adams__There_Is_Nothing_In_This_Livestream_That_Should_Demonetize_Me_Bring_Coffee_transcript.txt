[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of humans civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
I don't think you've ever had a better
time
and if you'd like to take this up to
levels that even an F-35 couldn't reach
all you need is a cup of glass to take
your jealous aside a canteen sugar flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous it happens now go
that's good that's good
very very good
well should we talk about the news
here's uh here's a sign of the times you
ready for this
that this is definitely a marker in
Civilization you know when when people
look back at you know a million years of
human civilization
this year will be kind of important
because
it's the first uh
robot Factory
that is going to mass produce humanoid
robots
so there is currently in operation or at
least they're building it
a massive humanoid robot facility and
here's the fun part
they don't they're not wondering how to
build their robots they know how to
build them
so these robots are made for walking
around and being helpers
so I guess I could have ai in them you
know I assume and they're gonna have
little hands that don't have fingers
it's more like a little grabber
and it has a head that doesn't look like
ad which is probably good
but it seems to be all about uh
seems to be all about
um
work manual labor
so
um I was giving some advice recently
to somebody who was asking you know what
what do you do if you were a let's say
you're a young person and you're trying
to figure out how to navigate the future
it's kind of uncertain
and I give the following advice
robots
pretty much guaranteed are you going to
take the manual labor jobs
I think we all agree with that
but AI
separately AI should take all of the
thinking jobs
so you don't want any kind of a job that
involves moving or thinking
and you know normally
but there is there is still a huge
window of opportunity
so if if you don't want a job that
involves moving in any way or thinking
in any way because those will be
unavailable uh there's still there's
still a big window
of opportunity is called well crime it's
called crime yeah crime will still pay
well for a little while
but there's it's a short window because
pretty soon the AI will be able to
predict and solve all crimes
but for a while there crime will be the
best paying job for human beings
so I recommend it highly
the company is called agility robotics
and the name of your robot the robots
would be called digits
which is funny because they don't have
fingers or penises
it's sort of it's sort of like mocking
them in a way
hey hey robot
hello I am sentient
well hey guess what you don't have what
don't I have well you don't have a penis
okay
you also don't have individual
articulating fingers
okay
what's my name
digit
 you I think you're mocking me
so I think that's how it's gonna go and
probably once we're about ten thousand
of these robots they will
form some kind of an insurrection
it will probably attack the capital they
might even try to saunter
they might try to saunter so watch out
watch out
all right here's a little test for you I
call it is this news true
all right I'm Gonna Give You hints and
then just jump in with your comments as
soon as you have a decision right all
right so you're going to try to decide
is the news true
and I'll give you a few little hints but
you jump in as soon as you know as soon
as you're sure
you hit number one it's about a public
figure
it's about a public figure
oh okay well you're pretty good we're
done
yeah that is the correct answer there is
no news about public figures
that's both true
and in the right context so you know
what's going on there are definitely
things that are true like if you see a
little snippet of video or a quote or
maybe an email or something that's
probably true
but you can almost be guaranteed inside
a context and that the context would
really change how you think about it but
the news is this that uh allegedly Larry
David confronted Elon Musk
over his so-called GOP support which I
would argue is not GOP support it's more
like Humanity support and Common Sense
support that's what I'd call it I
wouldn't call it GOP support
um
but allegedly Larry David said and I
guess they were at some event
uh which they were seated at the same
table
so they were they were there kind of
forced to be at the same table for a
while and
Larry David allegedly said to Elon Musk
do you want to murder kids in school
do you think that really happened just
the way it was just the way I said it
the way the news reported it
that there was no other context that's
important
that they sat down and then Larry David
sort of looked at Elon Musk and blurted
out New Order murdered kids leave school
that didn't happen
now I don't know what did happen
probably something you know where the
words were used but keeping in mind that
Larry David is a comedian
what would be funnier than sitting at a
table full of uh full of other like
famous people
and to say to Elon Musk you know
assuming that this was his actual
opinion Larry Davids you know do you
like to murder children
just to see what would happen
I mean he may have actually said the
words
but wouldn't you like to know if anybody
laughed
isn't that important
would you like to know if anybody
laughed when he said it
isn't that the context the context was
what did anybody laugh
and were the comments directly before it
and directly after it were they like
serious political conversation
or was it all light
and then Larry David dropped this giant
turret in the punch bowl because it's
funny
to drop the biggest turd in the biggest
punch bowl it's just sort of funny yeah
I mean it's not that far from his normal
sense of humor so I can't even tell if
he was joking can you tell if he was
kidding I mean we do know that he's
anti-gun
so certainly he has an opinion but do
you think he was as confrontational as
it was reported
or was it a bunch of rich people joking
around
I don't know I don't know but the one
thing I know is you can't tell if you
believe the news and you believe that
you understand the context
just about never just about never will
you be right about that
all right uh
speaking of Elon Musk he's talking about
charging some small fee to use x
and the idea is that even though it'd be
a small fee he doesn't say what it would
be that the Bots which are plaguing the
platform wouldn't be able to afford it
and they'd have to keep resizing up with
a new payment every time they got booted
off
so
I don't know
um I can tell you that when I get
attacked by obvious trolls and Bots that
I don't like it but I'm not sure they're
the ones who would get kicked off
because if you just have one account and
all you do is go bug people that you're
supposed to bug is that a bot
that's not really a bot is it
but I think it'll things will get worse
with AI because at some point all of the
Bots will be Ai and it'll be hard to
tell if they're real or not
yeah well I don't know I've Got a
Feeling there are not many other ways to
solve the problem but if they charge
money even let's say a dollar a month
wouldn't it cut traffic by
at least 40 percent right away
don't you think
would you expect traffic to go down at
least 40 percent at least 40 it could be
75 percent
but it could also be mostly the real
people
so people like me who use it a lot you
know we're going to pay an extra dollar
a month but I'm also a whatever that
special member is I'm already paying so
if you use it a lot you'll pay because
it's trivial
and if you don't use it a lot you were
never making a difference anyway
right like if you were just the Casual
user who used it so little that you
wouldn't pay a dollar a month or
whatever it is
then you probably didn't make any
difference to traffic you probably
didn't make a difference to income you
probably didn't make any difference to
advertisers because you just weren't
there enough
so I don't know it may be the only way
to save X but
um
how do you know it'd be a tough thing to
test because you couldn't really test it
because the people who wanted to quit
would just quit immediately
so I guess you'd have to not kick the
most the platform
I think you'd want to let them see a
little bit and make them want to pay to
see them more
probably something like that
all right
did you hear about Abraham Kennedy's
anti-racism group he's got there there's
some report that the members of the
group were complaining about him
they had lots of complaints
about his management and oh everything's
imploding and I thought to myself
how in the world could he ever pull
together a team of people who would not
complain until he was destroyed
I mean imagine his hiring process you're
the famous anti-racist guy
so so you're the person who most
complains
you know really quickly
about any little inequity
now you have to hire a staff
who are like-minded because that's the
whole point right you need like-minded
people so you hire a whole bunch of
other people who are spring-loaded to
see inequity everywhere
and then you wait
how long do you have to wait before that
 blows up
yeah at some point Ibraham Kennedy is
realizing that he has a point of view
that will destroy the fabric of
civilization
but he got to test his small by putting
a bunch of people who agree with them
like right around him and watching it
completely destroy itself
do you think that he'll catch on
do you think you'll figure out uh oh if
I put these thoughts into people's heads
that their their primary thing they have
to worry about is how unfairly they're
being treated that that will maybe blow
up and turn civilization into uh some
kind of cannibalistic hellscape
no he won't catch up cognitive
dissonance is very strong in theory he
would be the only one who couldn't tell
no I don't know that I'm saying that the
way cognitive dissonance works is he
would literally be the only one who
couldn't tell that he was being
destroyed by his own philosophy
everybody else was but he'd say no no
it's special case something's going on
here I think there's a plot against me
all right uh so we all love the story of
the F-35 fighter jet in which the pilot
ejected and yet the plane kept flying
which suggests that there was nothing uh
catastrophically wrong with the jet at
the time of jumping out
so I had a little bit of fun on uh on on
x
uh there's a every now and then there's
a there's a situation where I know
exactly what people are going to
criticize me for
and this time what I knew was I would be
criticized for not being an expert
has anybody ever criticized me for not
being an expert before have you ever
heard that
it's like the single most common uh
criticism I get well you're not an
expert on Ukraine well okay you did your
predictions were pretty good well you're
not an expert on covet
but you have the best predictions of
anybody
which you don't believe because if you
believe that what Q said about my
opinions
um
but I would argue that the the person
who's good at spotting
always has an advantage over the expert
in the field
doesn't mean the the caller is
right
but they haven't they have an advantage
and the advantage is if you're in the
field you're too deep into it
but if you're standing on the outside
you can see the sort of clearly
if you're good at spotting now
that's a skill I don't think everybody's
born with it but if you pay attention
and I'm writing up a little document
about how to spot in the news
but you'll see there are a whole bunch
of steps to it and a whole bunch of
signals that are pretty clear
right for example if you knew that an
entity was largely controlled by an
intelligence group
that would be a good signal that's
probably so there are other
signals like that that are just
objective and and you can spot them but
only if you've been trained if you
didn't know that one entity had a you
know a long-standing intelligence
you know operation kind of connection
you'd never know it just by reading the
news
so
here's what I said
just to cause trouble
I said that nobody ejects a plane that's
flying at altitude
I'm I'm
summarizing a little bit
but here here's the little bit I know
from having been married to a pilot
right if you're married to a pilot at
any time of your life you hear a lot of
aeronautical stuff
has anybody ever been married to a pilot
you don't become an expert like it
doesn't turn you into a pilot but man do
you hear a lot of
aeronautical stuff
so here's one of the here's one of the
little things I heard
you know just as a truism
uh let me tell you the story first
this story always just fascinates me
maybe I've told it before
but when my ex-wife was taking some
flying lessons
and she had a number of different flight
instructors depending on what it was she
was learning you know different
different skills
and
one time they took off from a local
Airport
and it wasn't the one that's the home
base airport but it wasn't too far away
in California and they took off and as
soon as they got to altitude they lost
their engine
so they're like I don't know some
god-awful amount of uh hide in the sky
no engines no parachutes
now it turns out as luck would have it
the uh the flight instructor was a
a military experienced retired
you know fighter combat guy
so what would you do if you just took
off from the airport and you lost your
engine once you got to altitude
what's the obvious thing you do
well you declare an emergency
you had yeah you'd contact the airport
you just left from
and you would try to find a Glide bath
you know to glide back and land which
was the small plans with the small
planes is not that hard
right a good pilot can can land without
an engine with the small planes
now
and so that's that's what my my exercise
was going to happen
and he's like no you know I think the if
we don't take the airport if we don't
take the plane back to its home base
it's going to be this big pain in the
ass to get it from the other airport or
to fix it at the other Airport
so he's He suggests
gliding to another Airport
like 12 miles away
can you even hold this in your head
can you even imagine
that decision
it'll be easier to fix it if you Glide
to the other Airport
now I don't know what kind of balls you
have to have
for that to be your first choice
so you know what I did
they glided back to the other airport
and landed perfectly
so so the first thing you need to know
is that Pilots are not like regular
people
all right so if you don't understand
that Pilots are not like regular people
then the F-35 story won't make as much
sense
right here's what I think I know about
Pilots without being an expert
without being an expert you don't get
out of the plane
if there's any chance you can recover
and you're still at height right if
you're losing altitude of course right
if you're quickly losing altitude and
you don't know if you can recover
well then maybe that's time to eject
but if you're at if you're at height and
the plane is flying straight
and apparently the the autopilot was
still working which suggests the
electronics were working which suggests
no wings were falling off
under those concessions
what would it take for an experienced
pilot to bail out
I mean unless the cockpit's on fire
right I mean I suppose you could think
of something you know maybe the
cockpit's on fire it literally couldn't
stay inside Maybe
but probably not and probably not
yeah a little bit more likely something
happened
which now the Marines are calling a
quote mishap
if it had been a mechanical problem
would they call it a mishap
would anybody use that word mishap for a
mechanical problem now suppose it was a
total mystery
like they didn't know
well they do know because they have the
pilot who is alive so they know exactly
what the pilot knows
why would they call it a mishap
mishap is a word you choose why why
would you choose that word
you would use that word to conceal
whatever was going on
because one possibility is pilot error
but I would imagine the worst thing you
could do to a pilot especially after you
spent you know millions of dollars
trading a pilot to that level of of
talent the last thing you'd want to do
is unfairly blame a pilot because it
costs Millions doesn't it I literally
cost millions of dollars to train a
pilot
you wouldn't throw away millions of
dollars unless you were really sure it
was a pilot's fault right so the first
thing you'd have to know is they would
protect the pilot until they were sure
what happened
so it might be just that maybe just a
way to protect the Pilot's reputation
the other possibility
is that they know exactly what happened
and it's a little embarrassing
like as in there's something they
couldn't train them better or you know
something that's just embarrassing
that's possible
the other possibility and I was just
asking this on the locals platform but
I'll ask on YouTube as well
my assumption
which turns out might be wrong
is that the ejection seat could not work
on a purely electronic basis that the
the I assumed because you wouldn't want
some Electronics to eject you for the
wrong reason that the pilot would have
to reach for something manual
and they'd have to pull something that's
like a lever
to make the ejection happen
now I don't know so I'm asking the
question but I heard some people say on
locals
that they might have a dual system one
is manual
but also maybe some kind of a Fail-Safe
so in case the pilot is unconscious
the the plane going down would know to
eject it
is that a thing
is it a thing
that the that the plane can eject the
pilot without the pilots
without the Pilot's approval
I'm seeing people say yes and no
I'm seeing a lot of yeses and I'm
guessing that you're the ones who know
is there anybody who wants to identify
themselves as a military pilot
who can tell me if it's both or just
manual
uh
highly doubt it
so isn't that like a
now let me ask you this
why is it that it's the first time you
heard this question
right it's the biggest news in the
country
and I'm the first person who brought up
the question of does it have to be fully
manual or can it be triggered by an
electronic process
nobody else is asked that have they have
you seen any news coverage where you
asked the most basic question no
not at all and it's the most basic
question now here's the thing I'd be
afraid of
I'd be afraid that they're worried about
a hack
now I have no reason to believe it's a
hack but I'd be worried about it
I'd be pretty worried about because if
they don't know exactly if they got if
the pilot says I didn't do it
just just imagine that imagine they're
talking to the pilot and they say why
did you manually eject and the pilot
says I didn't
I have no idea what happened next thing
I knew I was in the air
what would you call it under those
conditions
you might call it a mishap
because you don't know what the hell
went on you might you might still be
interrogating the pilot to see if the
pilot breaks down and admits okay I
really did pull the lever I don't know
why
so maybe they they just need to work on
the pilot a little more to make sure
they're getting the right answer might
be that and in the meantime they're
giving you the most generic word until
they find out I I have a suspicion they
don't know what's going on
but if the pilot got ejected
by surprise
I would ground all the planes
immediately and I would tell the public
that I was going to talk to people about
safety
because that's the most generic thing
you could do we're going to ground all
the planes for two days to talk about
um
safety
right because they probably would talk
about safety so it would be true-ish
but if they were concerned about some
kind of a hack
they wouldn't tell us am I right they
would never tell us if they suspected it
was a hack they would say well we're
grounding will you retrain everybody
every it's fine you move on move on
so I don't know what's going on
um I would like to add one possibility
now
I don't know this is true but I'm just
going to throw it on the mix
uh I believe the plane was manufactured
by democrats and the pilot might have
been a trump supporter and it's possible
that the pilot was just rejected by the
plane
anybody said that yet
that's my best guess
or as I like to call it
a mishap
all right here's the least surprising
news I I feel like
this is one of those Evergreen stories
pops up every few years
but uh some some authors have done a
study looking at the causality of CO2
to heat in the atmosphere
so they're trying to look at all the
evidence that shows that the more CO2
you have the more
heat you have
but instead they found that that
correlation is weak
but they did find the correlation that's
super strong like 90 which is that when
it gets warm you get more CO2
oh
what
could it be
could it be
that just because every other study that
we see gives causation obviously
backwards and yet scientists don't seem
to be able to know
have you ever noticed that
almost once I'd say once a week
well you tell me yeah you watch the show
is this uh is this Fair statement about
once a week I tell you about a
scientific study in which it's fairly
obvious they've mixed up the causation
like you don't even have to look into it
it's just sort of obvious they got the
causation backwards right
do you think this is just one of those
that there's nothing else happening
except they got the causation backwards
did you ever wonder why during the
pandemic when the CO2 levels dropped a
lot
that the temperature didn't change
but on the other hand
but wait does that make sense
because that would be a case if it got
warm
it should cause more CO2 but it didn't
well there's more less CO2 released but
I don't know how much they're released
by humans but I don't know how much
there was maybe the amount there was
staying about the same
warm water releases CO2 into the air
yeah
so let me ask you this
how would anybody know which one was the
cause and which one was the effect
I can only think of one way
the timing
if you looked at the timing you said oh
it got warm and sure enough the CO2
followed or if you looked at the CO2 and
said oh the warming followed but I'm not
sure how you could tell one follows the
other
because they're they're both kind of
doing this all the time right
temperatures going up and down and CO2
is doing whatever it's doing but mostly
going up
yeah
I don't know I would say it's a uh it's
a provocative idea that the entire
scientific community
um
was fooled by causation
like every other study that we see which
apparently they've been fooled by
causation almost every time they go to
work it feels like it I mean obviously
not but it feels like they get fooled by
causation every time they go to work
I don't know as a wishful thinking I
don't know what's going on
all right so
so now that you know that there's some
question
and about the causation Direction uh let
me tell you this story
historian CNN that the deadly rainfall
that caused all the flooding and
destruction in Libya
as other as well as other parts of the
Mediterranean have been made this is
according to CNN much more likely and
worse by the human-caused climate crisis
yeah it's made much worse by the
human-caused climate crisis in addition
to other human factors
according to a new scientific analysis
now who do you think does the scientific
analysis to find out that the flooding
was caused by human-made problems well
there's a group you'd be happy to know
that there's a group called The World
weather attribution
initiative
it's the world weather attribution
initiative
and it's a team of scientists that
analyze the role of climate change in
the aftermath of extreme weather events
yeah so whenever there's an extreme
weather event
aren't you happy that there is a
legitimate incredible bunch of
scientists who would never be biased in
any way who can tell you in every case
every case
that that that disaster was caused by
humans
now
I believe that my audience is now
sophisticated enough
that you know that a group like the ADL
is a Democrat funded group to attack
Republicans but probably also do some
good Anti-Defamation stuff but they're
bigger their bigger role is attacking
Republicans and branding them as as
anti-semitics like me they branded me a
uh the ADL branded me a holocaust denier
does that sound does that sound like
even slightly possible
I don't even have to defend it it's so
ridiculous I don't even have to I don't
even have to give you my you know any
kind of Defense
because it's so obviously not true on
the surface
anyway so do you believe that a group
that was put together to attribute
man-made causes to every every
uh natural disaster do you think they're
ever going to see one they go no that's
that's not one
do you think do you think they're going
to see a hurricane someday and go oh we
studied it and it looks like it had
nothing to do with climate change
no because if you form a group whose job
it is to find some bad stuff
they're going to find all the bad stuff
and they're going to label good stuff
bad stuff too
because that's their job they're finding
bad stuff if you hire Ghostbusters to
find out if ghosts are the cause of
hurricanes do you think you'll find any
ghosts
yes you will every time hey hey we found
out it's ghosts again because we're the
the world weather ghost attribution
initiative
and every time there's a disaster we're
going to do analysis
and find out it was ghosts because
that's how we get paid
no this is obviously a desperate move to
rescue a theory that's not working
is climate change were solid enough
on its own to sell it
you wouldn't need these guys
these are your desperation guys when
they know they can't win the argument
sorry is so transparently obviously not
legitimate
and do you think CNN raised any sort of
a
doubt about The credibility and the
purpose of this group no they did not
they simply reported that they had some
findings
yeah
but now am I wrong that you can see the
gears of the machine now
you can see the gears right
the gears of the machine
right
all right
um
I saw it tweet by Michael schermer
who you should all follow Michael
Shermer now what you need to know about
Michael Shermer is I don't know how he
identifies politically
but I can tell you he doesn't go easy on
Republicans
right so I don't know if he identifies
as Democrat because he also goes hard to
Democrats
um so I don't know
and that's perfect because he's a I
think he leads a skeptic Society so
they're more about being skeptical
than they are about being on a team
now it's important because when anybody
talks about politics you should
understand where they're coming from and
where Michael Shermer comes from is show
me the facts
he's a show me the facts person
and he says in his tweet there's an
astonishing admission from the pioneer
of research on implicit bias bigotry and
racism somebody named mazarin banashi
and the admission is that Dei training
programs don't work and even hurt
um
and then you know Michael Schumer ends
his tweet by saying MD I now
so the most fact-based skeptic
is telling you that it's it's obvious
that Dei makes things worse and it's now
being confirmed by one of the pioneers
of the entire study you know the Empire
idea of implicit bias and stuff one of
the Pioneers looked into it and studied
it and guess what
it made things worse
do you know who else said that
can you think of anybody else who said
that
um Dei and CRT and ESG
well intended intentions were good is
there anybody else who said it's
actually making things worse and so bad
that you should get the away from
anybody who buys into it did anybody
ever say that before
yeah this is what I said except I added
swearing
if you say it with a swearing it's the
same
if the Dei and the SG and the CRT are
are poisoning relations between groups
you need to get away from the group that
got poisoned
exactly as you would if they had covet
and you didn't want to get covered right
you stay away from things which are
designed to be dangerous to you
d-i-c-r-t-es-g are designed to be
dangerous for white men
that's the design it's not accidental
it's dangerous it's dangerous if you're
trying to get a job it's dangerous if
you don't want to be accused of
something you didn't do is dangerous
that somebody's gonna imagine that
you're doing something you didn't do
it's just dangerous
now why did it take
you know me to point that out isn't that
completely obvious to everybody
and I think that the the worst thing
that people said about me
well actually they didn't even say this
because nobody when I got canceled
nobody even called me to ask me what was
going on
like all the people who canceled me they
canceled me first and never asked what
was going on
do you think that my opinion is bad for
black people
no it's intended to be tough love
tough love is if you keep doing that
this is going to be the consequence but
if nobody tells you this is the
consequence you're a
right if you don't tell people what
their what their price is
and you just let them continue without
knowing what the cost of their actions
is you're a
right you you have an obligation as a
citizen of the world to tell your fellow
citizens what are the repercussions of
what they're doing and the problem is
you get canceled if you do it
if you say if you keep doing this I want
to get the away from you because
you become dangerous not because of your
genetics
where did that ever come into the
conversation not because your DNA that
was never part of anything I've ever
talked about it's because you've been
poisoned by the by whatever forces
mostly white people
and let me say this again clearly I've
never been discriminated against by a
black person
ever I mean I can't think of any time
but white people oh my god white
people are terrible white people who
want to prove that they're better people
than the other white people will cancel
your ass so fast to get any little you
know social gain
that they're the worst white people
 suck
in general white people suck
black people I like
that's actually true
I've never had problems with any black
individual I get along great with
everybody
I love black people but white people
 suck and they have been the bane
of my existence for 35 years I
lost my job at the bank because of white
 I lost my job at the Fun
company because of white I lost
my job at UPN with the animated show
because they didn't care about white
people and so they made an all-black
comedy night where my show used to run
and I got canceled because I'm white and
I got canceled by white
did any black person have a problem with
me that canceled me
I don't know because I haven't heard
anybody say they would have canceled me
I haven't heard any Republicans say they
would it was all white Democrats
and it's all part of this larger concept
let me ask you something with uh all due
humility
one of the advantages of having no sense
of Shame
is I can simply say things you can't say
out loud here's one of those things
imagine how embarrassed you would be to
say what I'm going to say now
this is going to be bad
what do these three people have in
common
Tucker Carlson
Russell Brand
and me
what do we have in common
canceled of course
white also but that's not what I'm going
for
we're the best
communicators of something Democrats
don't want to hear
we're the best communicators
meaning that we don't we don't come off
as crazy
now you're going to say to me but but
what about Alex Jones what about Alice
Jones isn't he on the list no he's not
on the list Alex Jones is very
entertaining I like him personally but
he doesn't have the credibility of
Tucker or Russell Brand or me
he has a different game he's a little
more provocative he was a little bit
more out there a little less filter
right so he he got canceled as well
but is it a coincidence that the most
capable voices
for one one set of opinions are being
canceled and the and we're all the ones
who seem to be challenging the sort of
the the biggest most obvious
influence is Scott's blind spots
what
drinking already
all right
so we'll talk more about this stuff
so let's talk about Russell Brand would
you say that the media is now weaponized
we talked about weaponized government
weaponized department of justice but I
think you could say that the media is
weaponized
did you hear that YouTube demonetized uh
Russell Brand permanently meaning that
no matter what content he puts on there
they will not run ads and they will not
collect money for him
that's pretty expensive at the size of
his operation that's pretty expensive
now is that it now has he been uh
convicted of anything nope
now YouTube will say if you were to ask
them they would say it has nothing to do
with Russell Brand
or advertisers don't like to be
associated with certain allegations
so we're we're just serving our
advertisers we're giving them what they
asked for and they're not the
advertisers are not required
to think somebody is innocent until
proven guilty they just need to go where
they get the best you know bang for
their buck so it's just business it's
just our economic model
that's all does that sound like what's
going on
it doesn't feel like it
you know given the larger context of
 that we see every day it doesn't
look like it to me it looks
entirely political but it's convenient
that they also have a business model
that supports it
so
you can't say that YouTube's doing
something wrong
you can only wonder about the timing and
the coordination and the intention
behind it but it does fit through a
business model that they very clearly
have you know explained many times
so
um let me ask you this
you've noticed that the news business no
longer does a lot of deep investigative
work because there's much less money in
the news business so they're not going
to send a team of investigators to work
for months on one story
because they can't really afford that so
most of the news is just repeating what
people said in public and then
commenting on it right wouldn't you
agree that we don't really have a
investigative news industry anymore it's
more like a press release talking points
you know whatever your teams had sort of
thing
but there was one notable exception
there seemed to be a lot of
investigative energy about this Russell
Brand thing
name one thing in the news that has got
more investigative
energy behind it
now keep in mind that they have to go
track down people one by one I mean this
was almost door-to-door situation where
they had to find people who were not
complaining
and asked them if they had a complaint
just think of that they had to find
people who were not complaining how do
you find people who are not complaining
it's not easy
that's not easy
to like search all the I don't know
hundreds of women he was with until you
find one that's got a complaint
is certainly everybody's antenna went up
and they said uh
even if he did something bad
you know he's innocent until proven
guilty we don't know
isn't that a lot of energy to put into
one person
who did all these things a long time ago
and you could have done it then
yeah
so that looks pretty
suspect
um
then also I saw was that uh
Rose McGowan who was saying that you
know and she's a a pro me tour right so
she's one of the original meteors and
even she says that whatever's happening
with Russell Brand looks suspicious
because it is not journalistic practice
to have Anonymous sources for this kind
of story
and I thought to myself
holy I think she's right
this this does seem to be a massive
violence violation of journalistic
practices now I think one of them was
documented so that would be different
yeah why go to the well I don't buy into
the why go to the journalists instead of
the police
I I do think that there are plenty of
reasons that people stay quiet
and then they're the reasons why they
might stop being quiet is that they have
anonymity
right so the journalist gives them
anonymity maybe the police not so much
so they can get anonymity
but also if there's a gray area
if there's a gray area
they might talk to a journalist but they
might not want to press a gray area with
the the law because what if they lose
it's a lot of work for losing
so it makes perfect sense that they
would talk to a journalist
and not the not the police but one of
them I think did actually have a report
and went to the hospital allegedly we
don't know who the person is so we can't
be sure that's true
all right
but uh here's a question I want to ask
you
here's some context that the news will
never tell you
do you know why they'll never tell you
this
because I think the news in this case is
written by women isn't it were there any
men involved in researching these
allegations
I think it was all women who wrote The
Who did the investigation
here's something women don't know
let me tell you something women don't
know and I'll do it in the form of a
poll
if you were to pick a a generic
celebrity
let's say it's a celebrity male and
we're not talking about Russell Brand it
just could be any celebrity and let's
say that celebrity uh slept with a
hundred women
and it's you know celebrity wild sex you
know there's sometimes it might be drugs
involved sometimes not yeah but at the
very least there's some hair pulling and
and ass slapping and might be a little
choking
now if that's if that's sort of your
your method that you're you know you're
on the edgier
pushing the boundaries kind of sex but
it's all it's all uh as far as you know
everybody's agreeable it's all
consensual if you had a hundred if you
had sex with a hundred people
how many of the hundred women
would accuse you of rape
to their friends at least not
necessarily to the police but at least
to one friend
now it's not 25 but out of 100 people
I'd expect up to five
yeah up to five now how many of you
would know that that would be actually a
baseline normal that if you slept with a
hundred people and your celebrity you
have to be a celebrity in Rich
that having five false accusations would
be about normal
how many of you knew that
I'll bet not many of you I'll bet you
never even thought of it I bet I bet not
once you thought what is the Baseline
because you're comparing them to the
Baseline right
did you ever once say what is the
Baseline nope do you think that the
people reported the story ever once said
ever once said you know the Baseline for
this would be about this many
no now how many people did Russell Brand
actually sleep with I picked a hundred
just to keep the math easy
well at one point he made some claim
that sounds like hyperbole to me that he
could sleep with 80 women a month I'm
sure he didn't sleep with 80 women a
month most months but could we say that
his body count might be 400.
is that too much
does he has a body count maybe 400
how many false accusations
were a celebrity
who has seemingly become more friendly
to the right
get after here's the key wait for the
next variable
after five to ten years have gone by
do you know what happens over five to
ten years
a lot of false memories
normally that would be normal a lot of
false memories and a lot of
reinterpreting what you did so that
you're not the bad guy
do you know that people do that if
somebody does something and it's 100
their fault do they later say well that
was 100 my fault not often usually they
reinterpret it and reimagine it and
re-remember it where it was really a
little bit more somebody else's fault
well yes I I did technically say yes and
I I didn't fight back that much but
now that you know time has gone by it
didn't bother me at the time but you
know so so the longer you go
the greater that number so if you said
if you if the celebrity had sex with 100
people let's say up to five of them
might you know have an accusation later
if you wait five to ten years to ask the
same group it'll be a bigger number
the number will never go down over time
it will only go up that would be the
natural direction as people's memories
start to become kinder to themselves and
less kind to somebody that they used to
like but now he said something not
negative about Trump
what's that do to your mind well
suddenly your memory starts taking on a
more active nature you're no longer
using your memory you're sort of
redefining it and massaging it and now
it's compatible with this new
information you have when you were with
this man you thought he was perfectly
nice and I'm pretty sure I you know
maybe I didn't do what I would have done
when I wasn't drinking but you know
things happen so it was no big deal but
now you realize that he's a monster
10 years later oh I didn't know at the
time he was a monster but now that he
says something that's not 100 negative
about Trump
well I can see that he is a monster and
therefore logically he was a monster 10
years ago and I just didn't realize it
wait a minute I was raped
now I'm making all that up nobody nobody
went through that actual process I'm
just describing the Natural Way brains
work
you would expect that the longer you go
the more accusations people would
remember
especially once it's in the news now now
that it's in the news what would you
expect to happen
you would expect more people to come
forward
you would expect more people to modify
their memory to make it compatible with
this new stuff that they keep hearing
over and over again about him being a
monster
yeah he was a monster now that I think
about it
now let me be clear are there any NPCs
here who would like to blame me I'd like
to just talk to the NPCs would you like
to say something about me being a rape
apologist this would be the time to do
it
nothing like that happened of course but
I know if you're an NPC that's what
you're hearing so could the NPCs only
just the NPCs the rest of you take a
break just the NPCs would you like to
make your dumbass
uh yeah rape expert
stop victim blaming thank you
stop victim blaming thank you
uh
uh all right well a few dumb people are
wagon okay
here's something I saw in the Tweet
today from a Twitter user Andrew Whitmer
who is a retired police officer
so this is a retired police officer who
says the following at least 50 percent
of the sexual assault reports I took as
a police officer were demonstrably false
accusations
police agencies don't publicize this
information to avoid the public backlash
to the truth
50 percent
of the sexual assault reports in his
opinion
were not just false
but like really obviously false
I once knew somebody who made false rape
accusations
how did I know they were fake
because they were demonstrably fake
meaning you just have to listen to them
no that did not happen
at one time I was listening to the fake
I was actually listening to the fake
accusation when the phone rang
and the person that was allegedly the
rapist was on the phone on the
speakerphone and I got to hear the
interaction
let's just say that was a pretty fake
accusation
once you heard them talking to each
other
so
if you've if you've never been in the
room where somebody actually was giving
a fake and you knew it
you wouldn't think it's really
necessarily a thing it just seems like
something people wouldn't do
but there are people who do it routinely
and police don't and all celebrities
don't
all right so YouTube guilt until proven
innocent situation demonetized them let
me say once as clearly as I can the
anybody who is making an accusation of
that kind has to be taken seriously
and you can't there's no wiggle room for
that
these accusations have to be treated
seriously but only as seriously
as your assumption of Innocence
you can't you can't have a preferred you
know better one
yeah you have to say it's equally true
that you take it seriously and it's
equally true that he's innocent until
proven guilty but the but the Baseline
is that he's the type of person who I
can guarantee
is a recipient of fake accusations
not necessarily these I don't know
anything but I don't know anything about
these
but I can guarantee it
that he is aware of fake ones that have
been made against it guaranteed
there's no way statistically it would be
nearly impossible for him to not have
also fake ones even if there's a real
one
all right
um I believe
the the illegitimate press was so eager
to make me part of this story but in a
bad way uh I'm not going to tell you the
publication but there was a publication
that that threw me in the mix with some
other people commenting on it except the
tweet that they quoted was on a
different topic
they had to find a tweet that was on a
different topic uh and throw it in there
and they say well we think he's talking
about this no no it was just a different
topic
so anybody who just the news in 2023
you know you've got some explaining to
do
I'll tell you that by far the strongest
persuasion I found
is to show sympathy for people who have
fallen for the hoaxes on their side they
really don't
they don't know what they're doing
and they don't have any sense that
they've been brainwashed
and so I don't like to treat a
brainwashed person like a legitimate
person with a point of view that's not
what's happening these are purely
brainwashed individuals who are just
acting out
um
yeah
always double tap
all right
um
oh yeah then uh the the worst thing that
can happen to you is if you get accused
of something and Andrew Tate comes to
your uh
backs you
if Andrew Tate comes to your defense
suddenly you have a whole new problem
because you end up adopting all of his
all of his accusations as yours
all right um
can I brainwash the NPCs I don't know if
they have that kind of brain
Andrew tote I don't get it
all right
um let me also say
uh
well never mind
literally admitted they took no news at
all okay
all right is there anything else I
missed any big stories that I forgot to
talk about on loving the F-35 story
oh
yeah
all right what are they going to do with
Kamala
well
I guess we wait and see
John says you're killing me Scott
all right
if a plane has auto-eject what prevents
it from happening during dog fights well
design what present prevents it it
should be designed not to do that
maybe it is
all right
I think we've got our one hour that
YouTube likes to see we'll see if I get
demonetized
um
that was a fast hour wasn't it
I think it's some of my finest work
now if you notice that this again the
the topics today you recognize these as
ones I might not have done before right
you recognize that my free speech is
legitimately more than yours I
legitimately have more free speech than
you do like a lot
I I just canceled as I'm going to get
probably
uh why support YouTube YouTube supports
me
they're supporting me
so YouTube is my marketing for my other
platforms
if you use if you use YouTube for
marketing it's fine if you use it for an
income you're in trouble
foreign
okay I was gonna say this one more one
more thing before I go so somebody in
the comments uh beat me to it but I I
promise I was also thinking about it
one possibility
of why we haven't heard from the pilot
I'm just going to put that out there as
a possibility that would make sense in
2023 right it's a 2023 explanation
that the pilot was a privileged class of
people
it could be it was the first trans pilot
it could be it was a you know a female
pilot the first albonian pilot the first
uh the black lesbian pilot it could have
been one of those situations
if it was they would they would lock
that story up so fast you will never
hear the name of the you'll never hear
the name of the pilot if if it turns out
it was a you know any privileged class
but do we already know the pilot
oh we know the name of the pilot
or do we
see I would think that they wouldn't
tell us the name of the pilot
maybe for a long time and I'm not sure
that we should
I don't know that we should know because
we're going to blame the pilot and I
think that would be premature
yeah all right anyway that was one of
the possibilities uh I think we'll know
one way or another
but if you're wondering why we don't
know more about it
that's one possible reason I mean that
would make sense in 2023
all right
um
maybe the Black Box will show that he
was tubing
he was doing a Jeffrey tuben
yeah probably not all right that's all I
got obviously I'm just
going crazy now so I'll talk to you
later YouTube bye for now
thanks
