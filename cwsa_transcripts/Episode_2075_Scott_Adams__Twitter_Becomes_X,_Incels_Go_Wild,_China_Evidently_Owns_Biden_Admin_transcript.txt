deep texture
I'll even put my microphone on for
YouTube that's how much I like you
[Music]
well ladies and gentlemen welcome to the
highlight of civilization it's called
coffee with Scott Adams and there's
never been a finer moment in your life
forget about the birth of your kids that
day you got married to the
person of your uh your soul mate or
whatever no none of that compares to
this moment and if you'd like to take it
up to even higher levels I know it seems
weird impossible but you can do it all
you need is a cup of mug or a glass of
tanker chalices Diana can't teen Joker
flask vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the end of the day
the thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous
Sip and it happens now go
oh yeah
ah The Wizard of Oz oh I get it Greg
nice
Craig on YouTube just called me The
Wizard of Oz ah
very good
The Wizard of Oz all right I give you
credit for that one
well let's jump into the amazing amazing
content of this show
uh Where Do We Begin
how about this is the category I call
nothing is safe
nothing is safe the FBI has warned that
if you use a public charging station at
an airport
for example
that there's something called juice
jacking where Bad actors can put malware
on the cables and and grab your
passwords for your phone
can you believe that you can't even
charge your phone on a public charging
station
without them trying to steal your data
uh
that's dirty juice yeah that's dirty
juice
so that's just the category of
everything you think is safe is probably
not
CNN is reporting on Elon musk's antics
apparently
Elon Musk is up to some
antics
what kind of antics you ask well
there was a time he changed the Twitter
flag on the building this was all that
this was all just this week
he changed the Twitter flag from Twitter
to Twitter
got rid of the w
San Francisco said he got to put that W
back
so he put it back in a very light letter
so it still said Tinder but you could
tell his Twitter then he changed his
name he changed his username on Twitter
to Harry balls hairy balls b-o-l-z
uh
then he made some off-color
sophomoric jokes on Twitter
yeah what else he had more antics
oh he he changed
was it the BBC and NPR are now called
state funded entities there used to be
State affiliated
uh you know media but now they're just
state funded so he's making a
distinction between Affiliated which
kind of means you have to do what they
say versus funded where NPR and BBC
probably have some Independence
you know virtual Independence
so that's part of his antics
let's see what else is in his antics
he also recently said that the S and ESG
stands for satanic
the S and the SG stands for satanic
and of course
he also said some things about Soros
that he thought that what was driving
Soros this was in response to something
I was saying about Soros on on Twitter
and Elon said he thought that the
soroses were driven by
pseudo-intellectual Ivory Tower ideas in
other words ideas that sounded good but
maybe they don't work out in the real
world
so
all of that happened
and then Elon Musk drives all of those
headlines out
by changing the name of Twitter to X
did you know that happened today there's
no more Twitter
doesn't exist
the company is called X now now x i now
I don't know if The Branding and stuff
on the site itself will change right
away that could be why he was changing
the bird to a dog
you all saw that the Twitter bird was
turning into a dog there for a while
probably just testing the testing the
water a little bit
but
it appears that all of the complaints
about musk's antics
and by the way the best part about this
story that I just read from CNN
is that none of the Antics involved me
did anybody notice the lack of me in
this story
I know it's unusual I'm usually in all
of my stories but this time it had
nothing to do with him supporting my
racist rants
as the news likes to misreport
so apparently the Overton window has
pushed me out of the headline out of
that story
so the good news is
that musk had so many antics
that the one antic that they've been
talking about for two weeks which is me
they got rid of that antic they had
enough Antics now plenty of antics we
don't need to add one
so that's good good for me
but X is the company that musk has long
talked about that would do more than
Twitter
in other words it would
uh it would take payments for example
allow you to give and take payments
maybe I assume it's going to allow you
to commercialize your work
I assume it's going to compete with
locals and Rumble and everybody else
because it doesn't make sense that they
wouldn't compete with the tick tocks and
the Instagram reels because reels are
the most important like you know the
catchiest thing in social media so I
would assume you'd have more videos I'd
assume someday you'll be able to tip and
pay creators and it will be a better
creator
place I would imagine in the short run
I was a little concerned this morning
but I don't know this is an unconfirmed
rumor okay
every morning I every morning I tweet
the link
to this live stream
and this morning Twitter wouldn't let me
tweet it
now it gave me an error
before it was successfully posted it but
it twice it gave me an error when I
tried to include a link which I do every
day
and when I tried it without the link it
went through without the error
so somebody said
that you have to pay for those links now
but I don't think that's true I haven't
seen that
so I'm only putting that out there as as
a possible thing that might be changing
because we know that Twitter is
suppressing links to competing services
such as sub stack that's why Matt Tybee
was a bad thing in Twitter apparently uh
so it could be
it could be that Twitter's going to war
with the other sites
which would be interesting but it would
be hard to navigate for people like me I
have to stay with my toes
all right well here's a story that's a
sign of the times
CNN Headline it says
losing weight might be bad for older
people
what do you think of that headline
headline in CNN
losing weight might be bad for older
people
do you catch the word bat might there
might
do you know what the other possibility
is
there's a correlation between losing
weight and dying
so do you know what the other
correlation
causation might be
that people who are dying lose weight
or is it that losing weight makes you
die what what do you think is more
obviously true
That Dying makes you
lose weight
or that losing weight and going from
obese to a healthy weight is likely to
kill you
which which of those two things do you
think is more likely
now the study of course considered this
possibility
so they removed from their data people
who had been hospitalized now that seems
fair because if you're hospitalized you
often lose weight before you die
but what about the people who are never
hospitalized
what about the people who are just
losing weight and they didn't
they didn't know why or how about people
who were hospitalized and then they were
released into hospice
are people in hospice counted because
they're still losing weight
I just assumed the date is bad
but so here are two signs of the times
number one a study that confuses
causation and correlation
that's 2023 Peak 2023.
and then the second part of it is
assigned to the times is having confused
the causation they lead with the the
performance headline
now performance headline is that there's
fat positivity and everybody's equal and
gaining weight isn't so bad for you
after all depending on the study you
look at
they actually had to support
being overweight
it is sort of weird and direct you vague
way in their headline
because like they couldn't bring
themselves to say that losing weight
might be good for you
that's just too hard
sign of the times
well remote work as you know people
working at home got
um it was very popular during the
pandemic of course and then I reported
recently based on other people's reports
that
companies were you know reducing that
and there was a lot less remote working
but I just saw the best argument for
remote work I've ever seen
um
so there's another mass shooting at a
bank
and one of the people who witnessed the
mass shooting was calling in on uh on
Zoom
so there was somebody who should have
been in the office it would have been
shot
but instead they were attending the
meeting on Zoom
and actually watched the massacre on
zoom while they were working the home
isn't it
I've been saying for a long time that
the the worst possible future is one
that's coming
which is humans will be um
hesitant
to go wherever there are a lot of other
people
because something bad might happen
that's one of the reasons I don't want
to work in a skyscraper
after 9 11 I thought to myself you know
what why would I want to work in a place
which is an obvious first Target
you know because you want where there's
a lot of people and there's a big
splashy explosion and stuff
so I've already decided I don't want to
go to sporting events
sporting events seem like the most
dangerous like an outdoor sporting event
in the age of drones
don't make me fill in the blanks in the
age of drones
going to a stadium event Outdoors
I don't think I'm ever going to do it I
think I've been done with that concerts
because the odds of one of them being
attacked by some kind of a drone attack
it's a hundred percent you just don't
know when and how often but it's a
hundred percent there's no way that's
not going to happen
all right
so what do we know about this uh 25 year
old Bank employee I don't like to give
too much attention to the mass shootings
so I'll just kind of use it to segue
into another topic
um
there seems to be some kind of an
in-cell
problem
meaning young men who have no purpose
and they're depressed and they have no
social life
and they have nothing to live for
the problem is that they're men
and when men have nothing to live for
they can often be dangerous because it
just makes them feel alive for five
minutes before they die
so yeah some of it is mental health
and some of it is probably psychiatric
drugs
and some of it is hopelessness
and I think it's Scott Galloway who's
been warning about this for a long time
and how many of you remember that I
predicted the number of mass shootings
would Skyrocket does anybody remember me
saying that
two years ago
yeah about two years ago I can't
remember I predicted it was Skyrocket
and the reason I predicted it was the
trend in men not being able to mate
because the whole mating situation and
dating situation has turned into the top
20 percent having a good time
and become a low value but while having
a good time
in other words the people were having a
lot of sex or devaluing their let's say
their mating potential by having too
many encounters
this would be of course subjective but
that's what we're talking about
um while the 80 percent of men are
finding it difficult to find anybody who
wants to spend time with them now
there's no way that doesn't lead to
massive uptick in mass shootings
if you add the you know the video games
and the movies if you had the news
coverage
reminding everybody about it
now question would you support a federal
law
that says that the national news cannot
report on a mass shooting
but it can report out as a statistic but
not details
now you'd still you still allow the
local news to report on it and then of
course anybody could tweet it
but I suppose you said if your national
news you know your ABC CNN Fox News you
can mention it as a statistic but you
can't mention any details
but the local news could fully cover it
no restrictions and you could tweet it
so if you wanted to as an individual do
anything you want you can tweet it
anywhere you want but as a federal level
you can't talk about it
I see more no's and yeses and I think
that's that's a free speech thing right
everybody's like
Free Speech but I would argue let me
give my best argument for it okay I'm
not convinced of this myself
but I'm going to give the best argument
for it
it's exactly like yelling fire in a in a
crowded theater
it's exactly that
it's not similar to it it's exactly that
it's exactly exactly that right now
usually usually I I mock people for
using analogies and arguments
but the one time that you can use it is
what it's exactly it's exactly that it's
stuff you say that guarantees people get
hurt
it guarantees it see that's the
difference if you yell fire in a theater
that doesn't have a fire or even one
that does I suppose you're guaranteeing
people get hurt right that's a guarantee
they might not die
but people are going to get hurt
and that's on you so that's why it's
illegal
if if you keep reporting uh and
you know glorifying in a way kind of
glorifying these shootings is guaranteed
to make more of them guaranteed
would you it's guaranteed
and it's fairly immediate
in other words within the same year
I don't believe that a mass shooting
that happened 10 years ago has much
impact on a mass shooting decision today
would you agree
would you agree that something that
happened 10 years ago probably is not
influencing the 15 year old today
but something that happened six months
ago
if it happened six months ago yeah
that's when that teen was 14 and got the
idea
now they're 50.
yeah
Columbine was 24 years ago yeah so
so that's my that's my strongest
argument of which I'm not convinced
myself I'm just giving you the strong
case all right now the strong case in
the other direction is Free Speech and
that could be the end of your argument
if you want if you want to say that's
the end of the argument I would respect
that argument
total respect
because Free Speech has got to be the
thing that you're if you're gonna
you know over react on something I would
prefer overreacting in favor of freedom
not overreacting in favor of censorship
so if it's a gray area of should you
favor free speech over some functional
benefit
I would usually favor free speech
but yelling yelling fire in a crowded
theater
I'd probably make an exception
all right
now
is it true that platforms already
restrict Free Speech massively
they do right
the the reasons the social media
restricts Free Speech are they think
that they're damaging levels let's say
hatred
or encouraging somebody to hurt somebody
right don't you think that coverage of
these mass shooting events encourages
people to hurt people
I do
to me that's directly encouraging people
to do it because everything that you
pump into people's heads
becomes part of their operating system
and that's what they're pumping into
their heads
all right well enough on that
um
so Germany made the third biggest
mistake in its history
uh by shutting down his final three
nuclear power plants and has no
apparently no plans to have additional
nuclear energy
now is it my imagination
or can Germany be characterized in the
following way
on the little stuff
they're really good
yeah getting the little stuff right tell
you the Germans they really really get
the little stuff right
but on the big stuff
on the big stuff
such as Holocaust
World War One
uh and closing all of their nuclear
energy plants
I'm just saying that on the big stuff
not such a good record not such a good
record but on the little stuff
the day-to-day stuff
Germans are excellent
so we'll see what happens as
Germany makes itself more and more
vulnerable to Russia
um oh here's a factoid I
heard about Ukraine that I was not aware
of this was on the kanakoa the great
um Twitter feed and musk waited on this
saying that people were not aware of
this but did you know that prior to the
war there was a time that
zielinski himself
disagreed with the Ukrainian law that
was going to make Ukrainian language the
only language of Ukraine
where it turns out that the regions that
Russia has now occupied are mostly
Russian speaking and it would have been
deeply discriminatory
toward people who had lived there
forever and spoke Russian
and didn't need to change their language
just because some government changed and
suddenly said that they should and even
was against forcing the Russian speakers
to speak Ukraine
so when you see that Putin was acting
like the protector of all
russian-speaking people there was
something to that that doesn't mean it's
the only reason he did what he did but
there was something to that and we don't
hear that side of the story so much
yeah and
now remember what and there's some
reporting that uh that Putin was just
waiting for a wink from Trump
to do what he already did which is take
control of parts of Ukraine
but apparently Trump never gave him a
wink
but it's still being reported as if
somehow it's Trump's fault for not
giving him a wink
that's that's reaching pretty far
you're reaching pretty far to make that
Trump's fault
another way to say it would be Putin
didn't invade under Trump because
Trump had a credible threat against him
seems obvious
all right
what else is going on
um I asked this question because I was
curious about all the
myocarditis and of course the big
argument is is it from the shots is it
from the covid Apparently both the shots
and the covet could cause some
myocarditis now that we know right would
you say that's the only thing we agree
on that some amount of myocarditis and
some amount
of it came from the shot itself that's a
confirmed known thing and some amount of
it came from the covid but there might
also be some amount of it
that came from obesity or lifestyle
changes or I don't know what else
whatever else
but
here's my question that I'm trying to
add to the conversation
do you think that we checked for
myocarditis as thoroughly as we might
now because it's a hot topic
and so I looked up what are the symptoms
of myocarditis and uh
just for the benefit of the NPCs
with those of you who are players mind
if I take a moment just to speak to the
NPCs right I'm going to read you a list
of symptoms for myocarditis and then I'm
going to ask you if doctors would have
routinely checked for myocarditis if
they saw these symptoms
some of these are really obviously heart
related
you don't have to tell me that if a
patient comes in with a clearly heart
related problem
that they would have checked their heart
because I do believe that if you come in
and say my heart hurts
they will check your heart
you don't need to tell me that
can I beg you don't tell me that after I
tell you the symptoms
but some of the symptoms are clearly
heart related and always I think any
doctor would have checked and in fact
doctors confirmed that when I asked that
on Twitter but here are some of the less
obvious symptoms of myocarditis
body aches joint pain
fever headaches vomiting diarrhea or a
sore throat
now if you went to your doctor and you
said you had any one of those things
how often would they have tested you for
myocarditis
I'm guessing zero times
now maybe there'd be some you know
cardiac Doctor Who's you know really
alert and said no let's just check
but my guess is
that you're getting checked for
myocarditis more often than you would
have
before the pandemic
what do you think of that do you think
do you think that the the less obvious
symptoms for myocarditis
as opposed to the obvious ones like
heart palpitations right if you come in
with here's some of the other ones
shortness of breaths uh Rapid or
abnormal heart rhythms I mean obviously
they're going to check your cardio
situation for that right but here's
another one fatigue
if you're if your holy symptoms were
fatigue and you found it hard to walk up
the steps
for a while
do you think your doctor would say ah
fatigue that's myocarditis or at least
we should check for it
well let me tell you this I've I've
complained to my doctor about fatigue
more than once you know over the course
of my life how many times did I did I
get checked for myocarditis
none
none right
now age is a factor but remember that
myocarditis is allegedly happening in
younger people
so it would it shouldn't matter the age
after the pandemic but to your point
it could be that before the pandemic
they would never check a young person's
heart unless they actually said my heart
is beating fast
right if you point out your heart is the
problem yeah they're going to check it
but I think if you're 25 and you said
I'm fatigued
they check everything except your heart
probably just wouldn't seem obvious
yeah he thought I was hypochondriac
Maybe
well there are a lot of reasons for
fatigue that's all I'm saying
um I've told my new hypothesis about
working assumptions
I think we have to say at this point
when we see the Biden Administration
trying to use Tick-Tock influencers at
the same time there's this
presumed legislation to ban Tick Tock
which turns out to have nothing to do
with tick tock
duracium other than China owns the
Democrats
or probably the Republicans as well
I think you have to assume that China
got to our government
there's no way that they would ignore
this risk
unless
yeah
so it's my working assumptions now the
the alternative explanation is that they
find too much value in Tick Tock as a
campaign tool and that would be
supported by the evidence as well
however
explain fentanyl
right you have Tick Tock were the only
issue I'd say you know if if I had to
look at the two explanations China
bribed our government which seems you
know sort of extraordinary so you know
not the most likely thing
but I'm comparing that to the other
thing which is well they just like Tick
Tock for campaigning it helps them get
elected
I would have I would said that getting
elected is the obvious one right oh it
just helps them get elected so of course
they won't
however
the context is that they also are
ignoring Fentanyl
and Fentanyl doesn't help anybody get
elected does it
there's no Democrat who had a better
chance of getting elected because
fentanyl was killing people
so both of those those are twin China
related topics
that seem to go the same the same way
despite having nothing in common
and that suggests that China actually
just owns our government because those
are the two biggest problems I see right
now are two of the biggest problems and
we're not doing anything about it we're
just ignoring both of them
there's no way that's natural
my working assumption is that China owns
the Biden Administration
it might not be true
but I would be disappointed in any
reporter who acted like it wasn't the
base assumption so here's how I would
ask the question to the Obama
Administration
not Obama the Biden Administration sorry
Freudian slip
um I would say this given your stand on
doing nothing about fentanyl that looks
useful doing nothing that looks useful
about Tick Tock our operating assumption
is that the Chinese government has
bought you off
can you can you give us any evidence
that that's not the case
now you can't prove a negative
but I would make them do it anyway
because the operating assumption is that
they are bought off
and I think the reporters should just
Embrace that frame
Max what are you doing
Mexico's president wrote a letter last
week and sent it to she pleading him to
tell him the company who supports the
ships etc for fentanyl Imports into
Mexico so is the Mexican president
asking China to stop sending Fentanyl
is that what happened
pleading him to tell him the company
supports
oh telling him who they're importing the
fentanyl into so that Mexico can stop it
now that's interesting now I'm just
reading a
a highly funded Super Chat here on
YouTube
China said they don't produce it
oh okay so China says they're they're
not producing
do you know do you know how they get
away with that lie
here's how they do it
we say to China hey you're producing
that those precursors for Fentanyl
and they say no we're not
we changed it by one molecule
so we're not doing that at all then we
say but it's the same thing it's exactly
the same thing and then China says now
it's a different chemical chemical you
never even mentioned this chemical this
has never even been discussed and then
we ask them to ban the new chemical and
so they do
and then they add one molecule and then
now it's a new chemical and then they
say yeah we banned everything you told
us to ban every time you ask us to ban
something we ban it what more could we
do
all right so that's the game that China
is playing
I do I do believe that there may be some
Mexico China disconnect where the
president of Mexico
is not so sure what's coming in and what
isn't and where that might be true
and it could be that the president of
Mexico is just pretending to act like
he's going to change something
because the cartels probably own the
government we assume the cartels have
control over the Mexican Government
and I I extend that operating assumption
to our government I don't believe that
we have an independent government
anymore
that's my operating assumption because
they don't act like it if they acted
like an independent government
then I would give them the benefit of
the doubt but if you don't even act like
you're independent the the burden of
proof has to go back on you
the burden of proof is not on me anymore
if you act like you're bought
the burden of proof is on you and I
would make Biden defend that every day
I'll make him defend it every day
all right
um and I think at this point literally
everyone knows that the legislation to
ban Tick Tock is fake
do you think there's anybody who doesn't
know that at this point like well the
people who pay attention the people who
pay attention to the news they all know
that legislation is fake and we don't do
anything about it
Mexican cartels have a new source that's
possible
they may have to do source
if you were the Mexican cartels wouldn't
you try to get new sources or try to
make it yourself or something
I wonder if there's any
um limitation to the
maybe El Salvador you never know
all right
so I've been telling you that there's
literally no good argument for keeping
Tick Tock which is the weird thing about
it typically you have good arguments on
both sides or if something's a stalemate
at least people have different
priorities and that's why their
arguments are different but in this case
I kept telling you there is no argument
for keeping Tick Tock there just isn't
one it doesn't exist but I saw one an
attempted argument by Catherine mangu
Ward who's enter in Chief of Reason
magazine now if you're familiar with
reason
they're they're neither left nor right
and they try to do exactly what the name
says which is
attack ideas based on evidence and
reason
so here's the editor of Reason arguing
the best argument for keeping Tick Tock
right
it goes like this
first you compare it to Facebook and say
Facebook also takes personal information
and we're not doing anything about
Facebook
okay that's a terrible argument
Facebook is American
Tick Tock is Chinese
all right if you can't make that
distinction
I mean is that the end of the debate
if somebody made that point would you
listen to anything else they said if
they compared an American company to a
chinese-owned company
both of them having influence over
American Minds like that's just the same
no those are not the same
that's the analogy problem
as soon as you make an analogy you have
departed what
reason
you've departed reason now I get if it
was a precedent if it were a precedent
then that would make sense
but we're not talking about a precedent
we're talking about two different things
an American company versus a Chinese
company
you can't compare them here's the next
point
um
there's no evidence that Tick Tock ever
used a psyop
and we don't close companies over
hypothetical issues what about that
point Tick Tock is being blamed to
something that they've never done or
there's no evidence no evidence they've
ever done and we don't close companies
just because they could do something
evil but they have not what about that
argument
all right let me extend this argument
you should get rid of the military
because China has never attacked the
United States
it's only hypothetical
you should get rid of Homeland Security
because everything they work on is
hypothetical somebody might do this
they might do this we better get ready
so we should get ready we should get rid
of our police
because the police are there for the
next crime not the last one
the the police are there for the crime
that hasn't happened yet
right I mean they take care of the
current ones but mostly it's for the
future
so let's get rid of all the homeland
security let's get all rid of all the
military let's get rid of all the police
because those are only hypothetical
problems right
they're they're taking care of things
that might happen by haven't
now the argument that you should allow
China to have a mind control weapon
aimed at the head of the United States
and it's okay because they haven't
pulled the trigger yet
maybe we should get rid of our nuclear
Arsenal because nobody's ever attacked
us with nuclear weapons
have they they've never attacked us with
nuclear weapons so we don't need any
it's a hypothetical why would you deal
with a hypothetical all right so here's
the problem
is the analogy problem again
so
um
Catherine
has made an analogy of an American
company
with an adversarial company
that's the wrong comparison
if you compare the wrong things you'll
always get the wrong answer no do not
compare Tick Tock to an American company
because you know what you know what uh
Zuckerberg is not trying to do
here's why Zuckerberg's not trying to do
destroy America
now you could argue that you don't like
what he's doing in a variety of ways but
he's not trying to destroy America
that's not happening right now of course
you can't be 100 sure of anything I know
I get it I get it can't be 100 sure but
if you're playing the odds
are you going to bet on Zuckerberg
protecting America or president XI which
one's more likely
to want to protect America
all right it's sort of an easy question
so that's the best argument for keeping
Tick Tock is to compare it to the wrong
things that's the best argument
to compare it to the wrong things
all right well Whole Foods is closing
one of their stores on Market Street in
San Francisco because the environment is
too unsafe
if you're not familiar with San
Francisco
let me explain what Market Street is in
San Francisco
it's Main Street
it's the primary
busy Street
Marcus Street of San Francisco is too
dangerous for a Whole Foods
and they're talking about the stuff
that's going on outside and they're
trying to use their bathrooms and
why would you live
in a city living in a city doesn't make
any sense anymore it's just crazy
all right
um
let's talk about these in cells some
more I don't think I was done with that
what do we do with the fact that there
are more and more in cells and they're
going to be more and more dangerous
is there anything you can do about that
now I would say the social media makes
it worse wouldn't you
and that dating apps make it worse
could you imagine a time when dating
apps are illegal
I I can't I can't imagine dating apps
will ever be illegal but it would fix a
lot wouldn't it
I mean it would make some things a lot
worse but it would affects a lot too
we we do have a civilization where
ordinary people can't meet Ordinary
People and fall in love and get buried
it just doesn't work anymore the
economics don't work the social part
doesn't work the expectations the you
know the whole model of relationships
don't work anymore now they do work for
some few people who are perfectly in
tune but it's the exception
uh Vlad asked me do Americans realize
the cold war is on again this time with
China I think so
doesn't everybody understand that
there's a cold war with China
I think we all understand that
yeah it's Opie Moore too and all that
stuff
all right well I don't have an answer
about what to do with the incels but it
could be the biggest problem and usually
I think Wars are what takes care of
insults the other thing is hard work
I feel as though if you take somebody
who doesn't have meaning in life
and they have to do hard physical labor
to stay alive you know such as farming
I think they're happier
what do you think
I I think that having a physical mission
to go physically make your money and
physically improve things I believe that
would make in cells more valuable to
even people who'd want to be with them
and and I think that they need to do
something
if the insult simply did something
useful that other people could see as
useful then they would probably attract
people
but maybe you just need to teach people
how to be worthy of getting married
you know I spent a lot of time probably
because the algorithm is feeding me this
stuff but I'm seeing all kinds of
messaging from social media that from
the perspective of women men are not
such a good deal anymore
but from the perspective of men women
are not a good deal at all anymore
except for sex
and that that feeling seems to be
growing and widespread already
are you aware of that that the
so what I was when I was you know in my
20s
my view of the world was that there were
plenty of women
they just you know didn't like me
but there were plenty of them and you
know if I'd if I worked in an
environment where there were women I
usually did fine
and if I found myself for whatever
reason in the environments where there
were not a lot of women
that I didn't do fine but as long as I
was around a lot of people I did fine
there was always somebody who would be
willing to spend time with me
so some of it is that we don't put
people in mixed groups anymore where
they could just naturally
meet and get attracted to people
and we also have a lot of people
that's a funny comment all right
sounds like a coastal issue might be
that's where the biggest populations are
yes indeed
oh just going back to that uh Tick Tock
the hypothetical psyop
is it hypothetical that Tick Tock is
causing young people to remove their
genitals
that's not theoretical
is that hypothetical
that seems to be obviously happening
to me that's observable
because they there's a huge increase in
trans and that's almost entirely from
media and the the most dominant media
for that age range is take that it's
almost it's almost certainly the reason
or one of the biggest reasons so you
don't have to wonder
now I don't I don't think it was
necessarily intentional but let me tell
you what it was intentional
what was intentional
is that China knows not to allow Tick
Tock in their own country
because of things like this so it
doesn't mean that they did that specific
thing it just means that they knew that
an open Channel like this would cause
this kind of effect and they didn't want
to have it on their own kids
so obviously they knew maybe just not
the specifics
all right there's an enormous carbon
capture project
I have a nerdish interest in this so the
problem with carbon capture which would
allow you to pump oil and do stuff as
long as you were capturing as much as
you were putting out
uh it wouldn't wouldn't affect the
climate if you were recapturing as much
as you were creating
so that was the prize but the economics
of it are terrible
it's nearly impossible to get a machine
that's efficient enough
to suck up enough CO2 that it could
possibly make any sense economically
however
like everything else it just keeps
improving you know there was a time when
you couldn't have a automobile with a
battery because the batteries wouldn't
last long enough but now they do so
carbon capture is going to go that way
but already Occidental Petroleum
their plan is to do so much carbon
capture
as a company and and somehow make money
on it
that they can pump as much oil as they
want in the future and they'll still be
carbon neutral overall
now the way they plan to make money on
capturing carbon you're going to hate
this
oh you're really going to hate this
the way they're going to make money is
not just turning some of it into
products which you can do on a small
scale
but
they're going to sell carbon offsets
carbon credits
that's right
the way they're going to make money is
from basically the government
I don't want to see people doing massive
projects that depend entirely upon the
law to make money
because if the law did not allow these
carbon credits they wouldn't exist
and so they're building something just
to take advantage of that law that will
be their profit
and that's just like ugh that's so
creepy to me that that's the way they're
going to make money the only way I want
to see somebody make money is like
making stuff that people want to buy
anything that's not pure free market is
going to be a problem
somewhere somewhere it's going to be a
problem
I don't doubt that it works you know it
might actually lower carbon in the
atmosphere but it seems like it's got
some problems
however the good news is that at least
Occidental feels that they can scale
this up to their their first plant
that's coming online and they're they're
going to blow most of the CO2 into the
ground and capture it Underground
uh they can get rid of a hundred and ten
thousand cars worth of
of carbon
and they plan to build 35 of these
so 35 times 110 000 cars
and that's just one company
so if one company could
remove let's say the carbon of
I don't know half a million or a million
cars
that begins to be important right a
million cars out of how many 40 million
or something how many cars in the United
States there's more cars than people
probably
100 billion
we make 14 million cars per year but we
also retire cars
yeah so
by itself it's not big enough to you
know change the world but it does
suggest that maybe carbon capture will
become
a bigger thing and they might just get
better at it and better at it over time
290 million cars
yeah it's going to take a while to put a
dent in it at one percent
but all all it's going to take is for it
to make money
if it's profitable there's going to be
more of it
yeah
all right
do you think racism is getting worse in
the United States Newsweek had a piece
on this and uh there's a good there's a
good article by Wilfred Riley assistant
professor of polycia at Kentucky State
University and so here's the the weird
thing that's happening with race
so
um
here's some Pew research data
uh eight and ten black Americans say
they have personally experienced
discrimination because of the race does
that sound right
do you believe that eight in ten black
people have experienced discrimination
of course they have
of course they have
there's people say no are you serious
you think black people don't routinely
experience racism
there's some people actually saying that
they don't they don't believe that they
actually experience racism of course
they did
8 out of ten doesn't surprise me a bit
all right here's the next question if
you ask the question not of black people
but of white men
how many white men in America would say
that they personally have experienced
discrimination how many white men it
would be a hundred percent
yeah it would be 100
no it would be 100 it would be 10 out of
10.
I'm just saying
now here's the second question which I
think is more important
um how many black people would say
according to the poll
that discrimination is the main reason
black people cannot get ahead
68 percent
so two-thirds of black people in this
survey Pew research said that
discrimination is the main reason that
black people can't get ahead now I
assume that includes systemic racism
so
here's a
Here's a thought experiment
there are two groups of people and let's
say they're the same ethnicity and
they're the same intelligence and
they're the same they're basically the
same
just two groups of white people let's
say and you say to one group of them
uh you're being massively discriminated
against and so it will be really really
hard for you to succeed in this world
because of all the discrimination
against you and then you tell the other
group you're the kings of the world
there are lots of problems in this world
but you'll you'll just Breeze through
them because you can do anything
which group is going to do better the
group that are told they can't succeed
because discrimination is holding them
back or the group that's told that
nothing can hold them back
it's pretty obvious
it's pretty obvious who's going to do
better
that's a huge problem
and this is part of that backwards
looking point of view that everything's
about what already happened and if you
take your eye off of the future
you're going to pay for it that's an
expensive thing to do if you're focusing
on the future and planning for the
future and doing what works in the
future you're going to do fine
if you're focused on the horrors of the
past
you're going to live there forever
all right
um
the proportion of American adults
describing relationships as good between
the races was 70 percent among blacks
and 62 percent of whites in 2021 so
basically both whites and blacks are
describing race relations as much worse
however if you were to look at actual
numbers of people who for example
disagreed with
with people getting married of different
races interracial marriage that's the
lowest it's ever about
so if you actually measure data
racism is the lowest it's ever been
because people are no problem having
voting for a president who's black
getting married to somebody who's black
like that that that's gone down to just
noise level it's just not a thing that
people are thinking about anymore so in
that way racism is the the least it's
ever been
so why is it that people think it's the
worst it's ever been
the data shows it's it's the best it's
ever been in in the things you can
measure but of the things that are more
squishy like the subjective stuff you
can't really measure
everything's way worse
of course it's the news of course it's
social media yeah social media in the
news are destroying the country there's
no doubt about it
it's obvious it's obvious that the media
is doing this
because the media used to brainwash us
to all believe the same positive stuff
hey we're a Melting Pot you know we
don't do that stuff
and people believed it and then they
acted like it was true and it was good
for everybody
but now the the media is uh the enemy
all right uh famous
female soccer star Megan Rapinoe
you might remember her from the Women's
U.S women's team and she was either the
best star or one of the best stars on on
the winning American team and she is
coming out opposing
the proposed measures that would prevent
um
people were born male from transitioning
and playing on women's teams
so she doesn't want to prevent
biological males who have transitioned
to women
she doesn't want to present them from
playing in professional sports
now some people have said
um do you realize that you would not be
who you are if they did
that she specifically would not be the
most famous female soccer player because
she wouldn't be in the top ten
or 20 or 100 depending on how many trans
actually entered the league
and here's what I think about that
is this not the perfect example
of performance instead of opinion
do you think this is your opinion
or do you think it's her performance
because I think she's also lgbtq am I
right
I think she's a
she's a member of the lgbtq team
so she's you know supporting the the tea
part of lgbtq so I get that like I get
that
there's a sort of artificial team of
people who decided they're on the same
team and she's on that team
right
she's on that team so
I get that
but this doesn't feel like an opinion at
all does it
it doesn't even strike you as that she
really believes it it just to me it
looks like she has to Signal this and so
she's putting on a woke performance and
you shouldn't take it seriously at all
you should just say it's a good
performance
and
you you've established yourself as one
of the open-minded people good for you
now let the serious people talk
because the serious people need to make
actual decisions based on you know
what's good or bad for the world you
don't Megan only has to demonstrate that
she's a good person there's nothing else
she needs to accomplish and she did
she did she successfully
successfully transmitted to us that
she's an open-minded
person
so I guess that's successful but I mean
that's just a clear example of
performance over opinion
and that ladies and gentlemen concludes
the best live stream you're ever going
to see I'll remind you again that if you
uh are not on the locals platform
scottadams.locals.com
subscription that you would not be
seeing the Dilbert comics that are
running this week only on that platform
uh which are getting spicier every day
a little bit spicier
I'm not going to tell you what this
week's theme is but there's no way it
would have run in newspapers let me put
it that way no way
um
all right
it looks like locals worked perfectly
today
we've got a huge crowd here
um
about the usual size Cloud crowd here
your mind is blown by what
Edward dowd's life insurance study for
early deaths
if there's only one I wouldn't believe
it
but I also wouldn't believe that we know
the cause
uh you just send you a tweet of my own
cartoon
Egypt is selling Rockets to Putin what
yeah
Lorenzo you don't have you don't have to
consume everything on locals some people
like the uh by the way so just for those
of you don't know
on locals besides my Dilbert reborn
comic the only place you could say it
there are also micro lessons on
improving your life
and the robots read news comic which is
more subversive than Dilbert Reborn
and I also do live streams from my
kitchen where I teach you to cook
very simple things and
uh from my man cave where we do enjoy
some uh legal adult entertainment
in the form of smokables
but you don't have to watch it it's not
required
you don't have to watch that at all I
mean you were watching this
otherwise you couldn't have commented
yeah and I would also argue that
the locals platform gives you more hours
of entertainment per month than any
streaming service there's no streaming
service that would give you as many
commercial free
minutes as this
all right
um I saw one NPC comment that I'm going
to call out
whenever we talk about carbon capture
somebody says we already have it it's
called trees
so if you want to identify as an NPC
just say we already have that it's
called trees
now here's another NPC tip if the NPCs
are looking around if I say I went
swimming for the first time yesterday
I didn't but let's say if I said in
public I went swimming for the first
time yesterday the NPCs should say what
go what should the NPC say if I if I
mention swimming what do they say in any
context just swimming
that's the best kind of exercise yeah
so the NPCs have to if you mention
swimming in any context they can't help
it it's like oh
don't say it oh my mouth is starting to
form words like oh swimming is the best
exercise
and they can't stop
you can even tell them in advance hey
Bob I'm gonna I'm gonna say something
about swimming I want you to try as hard
as you can to not say swimming is the
best form of exercise just just try to
hold on they'll say Hey you know my
swimming pool's warm and I was swimming
yesterday and Bob would be like
it's the best more professional eyes and
there's no way he'd be able to
prevent it
you can't stop agreeing with a fake
narrative about CO2 Danger
Craig what are you hallucinating
Craig believes Craig believes that I
continue
to support the fake Narrative of CO2
danger do you know that my whole
brand is the opposite of that right do
you know that what I've gotten more
trouble with for anything else is saying
that the projections and that the alarm
about CO2 are Craig you've
managed to consume all of this content
and come to the opposite conclusion of
what's Happening Here
what is wrong with you seek treatment
seek treatment but I will say this
the the science does strongly suggest
that adding CO2 to the atmosphere if
everything else was the same would raise
the temperature
but here's what I don't believe
everything else is always the same
I don't believe that and I also don't
believe we can predict it and I don't
believe we can predict carbon capture
and I don't believe we can predict you
know Mitigation Of disasters none of us
predictable so Craig how did you get
exactly the wrong opinion
all right
um
who's going to carbon capture a volcano
well in theory
in theory we've had enough carbon
capture you could
all right
uh you think George Soros is
experiencing cognitive dissonance I
think he's experiencing
uh dementia
but we don't know about his son
I would love to interview his son
wouldn't you like to see that wouldn't
you like to see me interview George
soros's son
that would be interesting
that would be one of the few interviews
that I that I would be like totally
interested in that
because here here's the thing I suspect
I don't know this is true maybe you can
give me a fact check on this if you were
to look at all of the things
that the soroses give their money to how
many of them would you say are toxic
it can't be all of them
I mean
you think you think most of them are
toxic maybe so I I guess that's why I'm
asking for a fact check so yeah I
suspect it's ones you hear about
because don't you think you sometimes
gives money just for climate change
stuff
let me ask you that you don't think he
gives money that's just purely climate
change
which would not be toxic but it might be
a you might think it's not a good use of
his money but it wouldn't be hurting
anybody
oh it would be toxic
so if he if he donated money to let's
say make a better windmill or something
that'd be toxic
you're you're tough graders
you're very tough graders
it might be I suppose it might be
all right but it would be well-meaning
even even let's put it this way if he
were funding Green Technology it
wouldn't be because he wants to destroy
the world
um
oh yeah I was going to mention Vivek
so Vivek ramaswamy is doing this podcast
where he interviews people and then he
gets to really focus on you know his own
point of view
and it's just a great way to campaign
but you know
you're still going to miss a lot of
people don't watch a podcast
all right
um Good Intentions lead to Hell on Earth
that's true
he is the best Communicator we've seen
Vivek is yeah he's the best communicator
uh for the Republicans
all right
the reframe book that's probably late
summer
but thanks for asking all right YouTube
thanks for joining gonna say goodbye to
you now
see you see you tomorrow
