all right here's the problem with
fentanyl persuasion so far
here's me doing a bad job of persuading
you that you need to do something about
fentanyl okay
um blah blah blah statistics
blah blah blah big alarming number blah
blah blah worse than some Wars
blah blah blah
coming from Mexico blah blah blah comes
from China
now that gets you right off the couch
doesn't it statistics
or how about I show you a graph
here's my graph look at that line that
line was going like this but now it's
going like this it's a line beware of my
line on my graph run away there's a line
on the graph
nothing
here's how you deal with the problem
you get your AI which can now make
artistic renderings of anything
and you program an AI to create a new uh
visual piece of art every day and you
tell it to make a photo realistic you're
not a not an artistic version but like a
photorealistic like it was a photograph
picture of a pile of a 300 dead
Americans
like a different pile of corpses
and you do a different pile every day
you just tweet it and you say you hear
the people killed by fentanyl today
today
300.
because if you hear onesies and twosies
and you know my stepson died and you
know your brother's cousin died
it's horrible on a small level but it
doesn't make you act
do you know why the Holocaust is such a
persuasive part of our our being
it's because of the visuals
it's the visuals do you know what the
other
um so-called Holocaust don't have going
for them
pictures
pictures
right you know we always hear about the
like Armenian wasn't there some Armenian
Holocaust right I've never seen a
picture
I've heard statistics and they're
alarming right
but if you don't have the pictures
you're not scaring people
so let's use AI
to create a literally a pile of corpses
every day tweet it out I'll retweet it
I'll retweet it every day
and
we will make it a big enough problem so
that the United States decides it's you
know something to do about it and by the
way if I were a republican I would say I
would attack the cartels in Mexico
and I would make the I would make the
Democrats argue that that's a bad idea
because I don't think they can
the trouble is it would lure them into
your frame
they don't want to be there
and I don't you know this could backfire
because it's pretty radical
