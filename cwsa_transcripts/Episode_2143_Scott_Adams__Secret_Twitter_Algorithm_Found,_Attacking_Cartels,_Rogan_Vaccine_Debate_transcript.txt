you
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization that's
called coffee with Scott Adams and it's
also Father's Day Happy Father's Day all
you mofos
um if you'd like to take your Father's
Day up to a level that nobody's ever
experienced before in the history of
Father's Day all you need is a copper
mugger a glass of tanker Chelsea style
and a canteen yoga flask of vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee enjoy me now for
the unparalleled pleasure or the
dopamine the other day thing makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now go
ah oh good meme there's a meme of me
drinking coffee with my Dilbert
characters
oh you poor YouTube people don't you
wish you saw all the great memes that
are going by right now on the locals
platform
all the YouTubers don't get to see I'm
sorry
sorry
so as you know it is uh Father's Day and
that's the day we celebrate uh the trans
community
so
um for all of the uh people who are
fathers no matter how they were born
we'd like to make this
more about the trans community and less
of about the fathers it's more about the
trans I think you'd all agree that that
should be the focus for today
all right
did you know
I let me let me uh let me give you a
little teaser for today's live streams
I'm pretty sure I'm living in a
simulation
in which the simulation is responding to
my
I don't know responding to my
affirmations or something
there's something weird about the news
today
I wonder if you can find the pattern
oh maybe that's the way I'll do it
now you won't find the batter
there's something about the news today
that looks very much like I caused most
of it
so that's that's the theme it's going to
look like I caused most of the news
today
now that doesn't mean I did right I'm
not saying I did I'm saying it's going
to look like that and it's going to be
weird
now the only people are going to notice
it are the the people who've watched me
for a long time because they know what
things I've tried to persuade but where
do you hear the news today
all right on CNN
apparently there's a big Trend called
internet dads
and it's actually Men actually
pretending to be your dad online
so that they're they're really big
accounts millions of viewers
and one of them is just a black guy
who eats food with you
so he just has dinner with you he just
gets his played out and gets you know
makes a sandwich or whatever and he just
sits down and talks to you like your dad
how to use it internet dad and
apparently there are a number of
accounts like this and they're huge
internet dads it's a thing
all right
and it's funny what the internet dads do
I saw one of them a little clip and it
was just somebody talking to the camera
saying I'm very proud of you
I wonder I wonder if that works it
probably does probably if people get
used to a character even if they're just
talking to the screen and they say I'm
proud of you it probably does work a
little bit
all right so I've told you internet dads
would be huge and here it is
uh Lauren bobert
dogbert Dilbert
rapper cappert
bobert
our representative Lauren bobert is
introducing articles of impeachment
for Joe Biden based on his not
protecting the Border as his
constitutional Duty requires
years
how do you do you think that'll go far
the articles of impeachment
no no that won't go far however I do
like that she's introducing them calls
attention to a very big issue the Border
and you know it's it's stunting and it's
persuasion and it's not too serious in
terms of legislation but I like it I
think she does a good job of getting
attention for her points of view
and I'm never never against getting
attention
uh in the hill
there is an article talking about a
fringe idea
well there's a fringe idea coming out of
the Republican side a fringe idea be if
you haven't read the article Don't cheat
if you've read the article if you
haven't read the article on the hill
what do you think they're talking about
is The Fringe idea
from the Republicans Fringe
The Fringe idea is using the military to
attack the cartels
it's a fringe idea
which they go on to explain that five of
the six major candidates for the
Republican Party
favorite
Mr DeSantis is a little ambiguous about
using the military which removes him
from consideration in my opinion
because I only want I'm a single issue
voter on Fentanyl
so uh desensis is great by the way I
think he's very very capable politician
but I'm just a one-issue voter this
specific election just unfentanyl
and
um
would you say that if five out of the
six of the major candidates for the
Republican Party five out of six are in
favor of using the military
and the hill calls it a fringe idea
well what would be a non-fringe idea
something that Democrats are in favor of
is that by definition if if five out of
six Democrat candidates for president
were in favor of the same thing would
that be called Fringe
five out of six of the candidates what
do you think
I think no
and by the way on the Republican side
it's not just five out of six
it includes the one who's going to win
at least the primary you know Trump in
all likelihood if you if you believe the
polls I think there's a lot of a lot
will change so I'm not sure he's going
to win the even the primary you know if
he has legal problems Etc probably most
likely he will can't guarantee it though
however that's Fringe
there's your Fringe idea five out of six
but I wanted to see if it included the
arguments against it
and there are some strong arguments
against using the military here's one of
them the Mexican Government might not
like it
uh
the Mexican Government not liking it
is the idea
now it's not the side effect
it's not the side effect it's the idea
the idea is to do something that the
Mexican Government very much doesn't
want us to do
that that's the whole point is to do the
thing they don't want us to do
so it's not really an argument against
it to say they don't want us to do it
it's more like a description of the idea
let's do the thing they don't want us to
do
well I don't know they don't want us to
do it
I know but that's the whole point that
they don't want us to do it and nobody's
doing it but it's so important we have
to do it anyway
I don't know they don't like it might
not like it
and they might retaliate
they might retaliate
my God
think of the things The Mexican
government could do the United States
uh are you thinking of things
because I can't think of any
what would be an example
remove their diplomats
what the are they going to do
I mean I'd love to hear examples if
there are any examples but it doesn't
sound like the strongest argument
um
here's another one the military wouldn't
be useful because the cartels are
dispersed all over the country
they're dispersed
I wonder if we've ever successfully
fought against any armed group that was
dispersed across a vast area
yes we have our most recent largest
military victory was against Isis a
dispersed group that was all over the
place and I haven't heard from Al Qaeda
lately when was last time Al-Qaeda
scared you
I feel like Al Qaeda was dispersed all
over the place and you know what the U.S
military dispersed them a little bit
more didn't they so instead of being
dispersed across territory they
dispersed their chromosomes all over the
 place until there weren't enough
left to cause any problems yes our
military can hunt down dispersed people
and kill them
I'm pretty sure they're good at it might
take a while you know it might take five
years
but is it worth it yes yes five years of
killing them would be worth it
all right speaking of that uh Lincoln is
going to China to see if they can make a
breakthrough in the fentanyl stuff
because it's holding up the other stuff
so there are other important things we
want to talk to China about
the fence and all things kind of a
roadblock now we want them to stop
ascending fentanyl precursors to Mexico
that Mexico that the cartels turn into
Fentanyl
China's excuses these are just ordinary
drugs
we send these ordinary drugs to lots of
places for lots of different reasons you
can't get on us for sending ordinary
drugs to ordinary places
now the story they don't tell you is
that they try to make these things
illegal but the bad guys just add a
molecule or two to make them legal again
so that's all a little game that the
Chinese place so they don't have to shut
it down basically
so it doesn't look like they're being
honest it looks like they're using an
excuse because they like to kill
tens of thousands of Americans every
year it weakens us
and and they say the problem's on our
end
problems on our end
uh that because we're a bunch of drunk
drug users
now
it reminds me I saw a tweet this morning
from Jessica Vaughn said she has a
Russian
roommate I guess who is who is saying
that Russia doesn't have any homeless
problem
it just doesn't have one
now apparently they don't have drug
addicts either or something or they
don't have craziness
but but it did make me wonder where they
go
do you think that Russia just doesn't
have any mental illness or drug
addiction
or are they does somebody kill them
I mean do they get put in hospitals do
they drink themselves to death of vodka
nobody notices
I have lots of questions you think
they'll lock that maybe
but
but China and Russia don't seem to have
a lot of homeless problems I'm not sure
that they're handling it the way we
would want to
probably pretty brutal over there
all right
um have you heard that this these
diabetes drugs new diabetes drugs are
helping people
uh quit addictions
so there are people who are taking the
diabetes drug for diabetes and they
discover that they stop drinking
or they stop smoking and it was easy
they just lost their urge to do those
things
and now they're thinking that this drug
interferes with some part of the brain
that uh
that involves addiction
now
does this sound like good news to you
would you say that's good news
because it scares the hell out of me
here's why
they develop a drug for one purpose
and then they find out it Alters your
brain
what are the odds that the only way it
Alters your brain is this good way
is there such a thing as a a drug that
could re it could reprogram your brain
it'll reprogram your brain
but only in that one way just as one
narrow way that happens to be so
positive this isn't that a nice
coincidence huh don't you feel lucky
how about those side effects
any side effects
I don't know it's it's feeling like uh
covet vaccine 2.0
it's feeling a little bit too much like
you know we're five years away from the
government requiring it
you know there we got this big problem
with addiction you know it would be good
I've got an idea
what if everyone had to get an ozempic
vaccination
no more addiction
we could solve Addiction in the United
States to give everybody a shot I don't
know if you could put it in the shot I'm
just saying that to be more provocative
but at what point does the government
get to decide what's good for you
they do it all the time right I mean
that's the whole point of the childhood
vaccinations is that the government has
decided what's good for you not your
parents
and where's the line
how far can they take it could they take
it all the way to we'd like to give you
a vaccination to make sure you don't
grow up to be an addict
and what if it worked it might actually
just work I mean the other possibility
is it just works and everybody's happy
and it changes everything and we're all
twice as twice as delighted when it's
done as possible
but none of this looks safe and healthy
to me yeah it's it's got like every red
flag you could possibly see
and here's the other question that I
asked
do you think it's a coincidence
that ozempic a real you know Pharma
serious Pharma drug
is helping with addiction at exactly the
same time in history
that we've discovered that these cheap
and easily available
psychedelics might do exactly the same
thing
as in cure your addiction
what a coincidence huh
big old coincidence that after a million
years of human civilization exactly the
same time we find this free you know
naturally evolved stuff that anybody
could get and cure their addiction and
maybe one or two experiences you know
that's the kind of reports we're getting
exactly the same time you can do it for
free big Pharma has a drug that doesn't
too which do you think will win in the
court of legal opinion
if if you think that the big Pharma has
this drug that can cure addiction at the
same time the psychedelics can cure
addiction and let's say that we imagine
they work about you know similarly
effective which one do you think will be
illegal and which one will be required
that that is
no we're going to find out because I've
got a feeling that the mushrooms will be
illegal and the big Pharma product that
costs a lot of money will be mandatory
at some point
all right
uh apparently the Oscars
I love this story because it's it's one
of my two far stories so I keep telling
you that wokeness has peaked
which is completely different from
saying we'll have less of it I'm not
going to say we'll have less of it I'm
saying it's peaked in terms of you can
openly mock it for being dumbass
stupidity you just openly mock it now
here's what I openly mock
so the Oscars beginning in 2024 in order
to win an Oscar the film producers and
directors will be required to submit to
the academy a dossier of the sort of
points uh
uh there I guess they have a point
system for the film Crews race gender
sexual orientation and disability status
other films cast and crew so it's not
just the cast and now the entire crew
has to be um
uh also diverse
you can't get an Oscar if you you can't
get an Oscar unless you're
now
correct me if I'm wrong this this
already is destroying the entire
industry correct
wouldn't you say that Hollywood has
destroyed itself
primarily by forcing diversity into
every product which is a burden on the
writing
right by the way that's that's the least
racist most accurate way to describe it
if you don't want to sound like a bigot
is that if you're a writer if it's hard
enough to write a good story about
anything
but if you burden the story with and
you've got to have a handicapped person
in it and it's got to be multi-racial
and you know there's got to be three
trans whatever it is that that the the
burden on the production
definitely is going to affect your uh
your quality even if all the people
involved are first-rate it it's just an
extra burden on the writing Etc
so
Hollywood has completely destroyed
itself
because they've made their product so
woke that you can't watch it it's just
unwatchable crap now and
I I have to admit I kind of enjoy
watching it watching the Oscars become a
complete joke to the point where the
people who work in the industry are
saying all right this is too far this is
way too far it now is just ridiculous
makes my heart sing
I don't know to me it's just funny that
because I always tell you that things
things that have gone too far
generally hit the wall by continuing to
go too far until it's just stupid it's
ridiculous and you can just laugh at it
and we're there
we're there
uh
I saw an article I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna reference
uh in terms of the URL but
the idea was that the country is falling
apart because of a lack of General
competence because the world is more
complicated but there are more
promotions of people for social reasons
over competency
and therefore we have more incompetent
people and important jobs
that are complicated jobs than ever
before and that that's the reason that
everything seems broken
now I've told you that if you try to get
customer support anywhere
it's just a joke now
like it would we always we always made
fun of how hard it was to get help on
the phone and stuff but even if you can
guess somebody on the phone which is
hard enough
you're talking to somebody that you know
is unqualified half the time I mean you
just tell they don't even know their own
job I can't tell you the amount of
problems I've had
because somebody tried to help me with a
technical problem and didn't know how to
do it made everything worse
yeah my health care especially trying to
get help from my Healthcare organization
oh my God
so would you agree that there's maybe in
the last just few years three to five
years that there's a competency problem
that's just glaringly obvious that the
United States is no longer just good at
stuff
just good at basic stuff now I don't
think it's all a diversity hiring
situation there's also something about
young people
if you took a 16 year old from my
generation
you would think that they were 25.
today
do you realize that right a 16 year old
from my generation if you just
introduced him into the modern world
people would think they were 25.
because they would act they would act
capable
they would be able to do what most 25
year olds can do
and they would do it right in front of
you and they wouldn't complain and they
would show up on time and they'd work
hard and they would have some you know
future intended for themselves
you you would never see that the 16 year
old
today so there's a competency problem of
just young people are not being taught
just to do stuff
just simply doing things because if if
you're playing video games you're in an
artificial world where all the problems
are artificial
if you're if you spend all of your time
in the real world you're solving real
problems all day long just one after
another if you sit in front of your
video games you're solving problems but
they're all the fake ones that don't
apply to the real world
anyway I think the competence problem is
big and bad it has something to do with
things are getting more complicated
you know so at the same time our
capabilities might be coming down for
several different reasons the complexity
of our systems is going up and I think
as we've reached some kind of a
crossover point where we're generally
just not capable of handling our own
systems we don't have the capability to
handle it
all right
all right I saw a graph on a tweet from
razib Khan
um and he said what's happened in the
late 2010s to drive women to the left so
it was a graph they showed that women
and young women in particular in the
late 2010s suddenly the the graph that
has been relatively you know flat for a
long time just went this is a Zoop and
women became super Lefty in the last
10 years or so super Lefty
and he asked what caused it why did
young women become super left and I
would say
there's only one reason
propaganda
no propaganda if you say it's the me too
thing it's part of that that becomes
part of the propaganda if you say it's
about abortion yes that's part of the
propaganda
um
right and what about colleges it also
coincides with a huge increase in
college enrollment of women in soft
majors
do you think that made any difference of
course I did it made a huge difference
so you've got B2 you've got the college
universities you've got social media
persuading in One Direction you've got
the mainstream media persuading in the
same direction
um
so the
the surprise would be if it didn't
happen
right if you looked at all the stuff
that was happening oh and specifically
the rise of trump
when when Trump hit the scene the entire
mainstream media
tried to make him the enemy a woman
right so you could totally see that it
was propaganda it was based on real
events in the world but then it was
propagandized and women were the most
affected
probably because the natural topics were
more in their domain right
and so the metoo stuff was mostly a
woman problem not entirely but mostly
and abortion feels like mostly a female
problem not entirely but you know you
know
so
I I feel like that's the least
mysterious
shift we've ever seen it's completely
obvious from the propaganda and the
topics that were in the news
all right
um this story I I had to read it like 50
times to make sure I wasn't
hallucinating
you might have the same experience
you're going to say when was the date of
the story
did we not already go through this how
could we possibly be talking about this
today
here's the story
Twitter just found another Shadow band
algorithm that they hadn't found before
there was actually something that was
suppressing you if I think if you got a
number of complaints from other Twitter
users you would be suppressed but you
wouldn't know it do you know who is also
suppressed
Elon Musk
that's right because Elon Musk has the
kind of account because you know it's
the biggest famous account he's going to
get a lot of people complaining about
him just you know protest complaints
so the actual owner of Twitter
unbeknownst to himself
was Banning himself
that's a real thing
musk was Shadow Banning himself
accidentally he didn't know it because
Twitter still had an algorithm that was
Banning people like him people who get
complaints
now I get and Elon Musk confirm this
musk actually confirmed it now doesn't
that make you feel like wait a minute
isn't this a repeat
I I thought they went in there and they
they tore out by their Roots all of
those bad or you know algorithms and it
was full transparency
told us what he was doing which I love
and I love this too I love the fact that
this is full transparency we just found
this thing this is what it did
and uh we're trying to get rid of it
I I love that kind of mistake
you know because it's a mistake that it
exists You could argue it's a mistake
that they didn't find it till now
but I love the fact that once I found it
it was full disclosure
and then we're going to go fix it so
that part A plus you know I say this all
the time but I think it's always worth
it worth repeating if you judge people
by their mistakes you could have a very
sad life
because everybody makes mistakes
including you
but if you judge people by how they
respond to their mistakes
in this case you could call that a
mistake that that algorithm still
existed but the way they handled it a
plus
so that's my final grade my final grade
is a plus because I care about how you
handled it I don't care that it was
there I mean I care but I'm not going to
judge anybody for it
all right um
I'm going to make a further prediction
that there will be some point in the
maybe near future in which Twitter will
discover that the tweaking of these
algorithms was available to people on
the outside
meaning that there was probably at least
somebody somewhere who could actually
dial into I'll say dial in use the old
term uh could just dial into Twitter and
and tweak the algorithm any way they
wanted probably an intelligence agency
probably an intelligence agency now it
could be that they just had an Insider
who would do a forum
which would look the same you know I'm
not saying they necessarily could you
know hack the system or that they had a
back door which is possible they just
might have an Insider who could do it
for him
makes you wonder how many other uh
suppression algorithms are in the code
now I would like to once again claim the
best prediction about this
back when Jack Dorsey was running I said
two things number one there's no way
that Jack Dorsey knows what the
algorithm is doing and people laughed at
me actually laughed it's like my god of
course he knows of course he knows nope
I would say it is now confirmed Beyond
any doubt he did not know because it was
unknowable
the complexity of it and the number of
places they had Shadow Banning code it
was just bigger than any one person
would know and and I even said that it's
not just that not just that Jack Dorsey
might not know what the code is doing
but I speculated that there was nobody
in Twitter Who would know
would you would you agree with that now
they just found this
what can you give me credit for saying
that nobody knew what the algorithm was
doing
now maybe there was some secret person
to do but you know in terms of
management nobody knew
um
yeah
so everything you suspected about uh
Twitter having some kind of suppression
was all true
do you remember was it a week ago
I told you I thought Twitter was
suppressing me
how many remembers would be saying that
like a week ago
it like it seemed obvious to me that
something had happened again
now how many how many complaints do you
think I get on my Twitter account
I mean I I wouldn't necessarily see them
right I wouldn't be aware of them
but given my recent dust up in the
public you don't think a lot of people
are reporting my account for you know
just to try to screw with me of course
they are so that this this specific
suppression algorithm they found is
exactly in my ballpark and it's exactly
in musk's ballpark too we're both the
kind of personalities that attract a lot
of complaints and that's what got us
suppressed
yeah I I noticed
um it looked like somebody just put the
brakes on my account a few weeks ago
it just looked like everything stopped
suddenly
anyway so that's probably what it was
um
all right
this is amazing there there's a j RFK
not JFK RFK Jude your story about a CDC
whistleblower and this is the most
mind-blowing story
now I'll simply tell you what he's
saying I have no way to validate this as
true
but
he's a credible personality and he's
saying it and he's running for president
so I'm going to repeat it he says
there's a CDC whistleblower who
personally was in a meeting where they
they looked at data
that black children were being injured
by this
medicine
and they decided to hide the fact and
all the documents were collected up and
thrown in the same trash before they
left the room
does that sound true
yeah it's two on the nose
uh my my suspicion is that if you ask
the company about this they would say
something like yes we did collect them
all and throw them away but it's because
the study was bad
and then if you looked into it you would
find out maybe there were some holes in
the study
now I'm not defending them because I I
don't even remember what company it was
frankly I'm just telling you you should
never believe one side of an argument
never believe one side of an argument
doesn't matter how convincing it is
never believe one side of an argument
that's why we have lawyers
that's why there are two lawyers if if
you could believe one side you'd only
need one one lawyer for every trial okay
we're we're going to tell you what he
did now vote
no defense needed just just one lawyer
no you don't do that because one lawyer
can always be convincing that's what
they learn to do
so when RFK Jr who is a trained lawyer
when he goes on Joe Rogan and he says a
bunch of things that sound really true
well it should Sound True he's trained
to make things Sound True he's really
good at it because that's exactly his
profession
so
whether it is true
you should not use your confidence in
his argument as part of your reasoning
because the confidence in this argument
will always be there whether he's right
or not
because he would be a guy who can make a
confident argument about something
that's true or not to he would have that
skill so you don't know what he's doing
and you don't know if he could just be
wrong and confidently arguing but maybe
wrong on some facts
so have I ever told you
that watching Joe Rogan have somebody on
for three hours is not only not helping
it's worse than nothing
have you heard me say that
that having one expert on for three
hours is worse than nothing it would be
better just not even have them on
um yeah
I've been saying that for a long time
and I've said the ideal situation would
be Joe Rogan or somebody like him having
two experts on who disagree and do you
remember remember what I said about the
format you know what the format should
be if they're the two experts
there was one thing I said about the
format that was important
no time limit
no time limit
that was very important because
otherwise the person has the weakest
argument just runs the clock out
you can't let one of them run the clock
out when they're losing you need a
winner
right you need to just stay there until
somebody's
ground down
so here's a real thing that happened in
the news
so Joe Rogan had RFK Jr on and RFK Jr
made a bunch of claims about
vaccinations and whatnot and there is a
expert on vaccinations I guess or right
some expert in that field is relevant
Professor Peter Hotes he's an MD and a
PhD
and I guess on Twitter at least he was
critical of rfkg Junior's claims
so
Joe Rogan
invited
Professor Peter Hotes to appear with RFK
Jr the two of them on the show
and here's the best part
no time limit
no time limit
now
Elon Musk weighed in and Elon was very
much in favor of this idea and I think
Joe Rogan offered a hundred thousand
dollars to charity if they would debate
other people on the internet Bill Ackman
and a number of other rich people said
I'll give you a hundred thousand I'll
give you a quarter million somebody said
that Tay offered half a million I'm not
sure that's true but you know you can
see people were trying to jump on board
and and fund it now the funding would be
for charity and musk actually started
mocking hotels in public by saying he
must not like charity you know jokingly
but trying to put a little pressure on
him to do it
now
how happy are you
how happy are you
he's so far he's so far not agreed to it
at least as of a few minutes ago
do you think he will
do you think he'll take it you know
now I'm gonna I'm gonna be charitable
here
he's a critic but that does not mean he
would be the best person to you know
debate in public
simply being an expert and a Critic does
not make you as capable
as Joe Rogan you know talking in public
and it does not make you nearly as
capable as RFK Jr
talking in public
so it could be that you know it's just
not the format that his skills fit I
don't know that I'm just speculating
there there could be an obvious reason
why he wouldn't want to do it which had
nothing to do with his confidence of his
of his point
but if he doesn't do it don't you think
you could find another expert to do it
you know don't you think you could find
somebody else who has a similar view
who's also an expert who would love to
get on there and debate RFK Jr and
embarrass him in front of the world
so
um
I think this is one of the best
one of the best outcomes in a long time
we're finally on the cusp of an Internet
dad
getting two experts to argue in front of
you with no time limit
that's what we need
that's everything now
if it happens I mean maybe it won't be
perfect the first time you know maybe
the people run on too much you know
anything could happen
but there is nothing that is more
positive more useful a better a better
signal for the country
than what Joe Rogan is doing right now
Joe Rogan saving the country
or or I would say that today or this
week Joe Rogan did more for the country
than Congress
if he pulls this off if he pulls it off
he's doing more for the country
civilization it's not just the country
he's doing more for civilization
than the entire government if he can
pull this off
right it's that important I'd love to
see it because you know there's there's
no mainstream Media company that could
do that do you know why
obviously that they're all they're all
funded by big Pharma
so if you're funded by big Pharma
there's no freaking way you can host a
debate on any of this stuff
so it's the perfect thing at the perfect
time with at least one of the people
would be the perfect person we hope the
other one says yes
and this would be frankly amazing
um because I have to tell you
I don't know who's right
and unlike my usual artificial certainty
I I don't even lean one way
I just don't know
I'm pretty sure that if you're on the
right you only see things that agree
with you if you're on the left you only
see things that agree with you I've seen
both
right if you don't go look for the other
side you'll never see it because the
other side argument whatever the other
side is you know that your algorithm has
locked you in a bubble
you're going to see countless
anti-vaccine stuff once you get in the
bubble you will never
see the other side you've got to go
Google and look for it I've done it all
right I know that it's not going to come
to me naturally I got to go look for it
if you do
you're going to come away with some
humility to use Art's word uh you're
going to come away with some humility
and the humility is listening to that
one person or that one side did not
serve you it did not serve you
because you haven't heard of the other
side
so please
please let's make this work
all right
um
Chris Hayes tweeted about this situation
and MSNBC Chris Hayes he says very cool
to watch all these Millionaires and
billionaires push in the anti-vaxx line
that has killed tens of thousands if not
hundreds of thousands of working people
so I tweeted to that retweeted him and
said confidence and data on any topic
feels absurd in 2013.
doesn't it feel absurd to see a talking
head
act with some certainty about the
science
now I'm not even saying he's wrong
I'm not claiming he's wrong
I'm claiming that I don't know
and if he says he knows
that's almost like a mental problem
I mean it would seem like what would
that be uh
uh what's the name of that syndrome
where you think you're smarter than you
are
what's that called with the two names
why am I blanking on that
you know what I'm talking about yeah
darling Krueger Dunning Krueger doesn't
that seem like Dunning Krueger to you
and again he might be right but it would
only be by accident yeah you don't think
he has some Mastery of that data that
you don't do you
do you think he's seen the same data
that you've seen
or do you think that Chris Hayes because
like all of us you know once he starts
interacting with a certain kind of
information it's all he sees
it's all that gets fed to him it's all
anybody talks about in his Circle
uh referring to 23 team might be the
mental problem
John
you're so weak John
so weak
anyway
um but I love the fact that he's mocking
the Millionaires and billionaires for
pushing anti-vax line
is that what you say
when when Joe Rogan and Elon Musk and
all the other people kicked in when they
when they were begging the two experts
to debate in public
that was pushing an anti-vaxx line
asking the person who is the most
positive about vaccines and an expert we
will pay you any amount of money will
give you well not him actually to
charity I guess what what will it take
please dear God can you get on and
inform us and you know in a way that is
credible with somebody who can challenge
you
literally begging for better information
and Chris Hayes says that they're
anti-vaxx begging for both sides
like it's the the main thing they're
spending time on today is to get both
sides of the argument
and they can't get it so far
and that's anti-vaxx wanting both sides
all right
ladies and gentlemen
um
I would like to read you my robots read
news comic
that you could see if you were a
subscriber to the locals platforms Scott
adams.locals.com
but as you know the robots never move
they're just reading the news one robot
and Roba says President Biden expects to
spend at least half of his summer
vacation in the afterlife
he has a cloud next to clean to Queen
Elizabeth and he is reportedly Disturbed

robe

God saved the queen
it's Father's Day
it's a dad joke
dad jokes on Father's days are allowed
they are allowed
now you might also you might also ask
but what kind of a dad joke did you do
for Father's Day
well if I could find it I'd tell you
right here
come on
here it is
so it's a big old sunday comic
and this is the this is a an example of
what I sometimes do in the Dilbert comic
which is I get a little bit ahead of the
readers
so the people who are watching this will
get this joke but maybe eighty percent
of the public wouldn't get it and they'd
have to
they have to look it up I guess anyway
so the boss is there with Dilbert it's a
meeting room and there's an empty chair
between him and the boss says I called
this meeting to introduce our new super
prompt engineer
and he looks at the empty chair and he
says but apparently he's running late
and Dilbert says the super prompt
engineer is late
boss says yes that's what I said
then dilber says that's not very
super prompt is it
and the boss says I have no idea what
you're talking about
and then the super prompt engineer walks
in and he says Hi everyone sorry I'm
late I guess I'm not as super prompt as
I thought
and then the looks around the room he
says really nothing
and Dilbert touches him gently on the
arm and says
Let It Go
Let It Go
all right that's your dad jokes for the
day YouTube thanks for joining
and uh
I will talk to you all tomorrow I'm
going to stay and talk to the locals
people
because they're special bye for now
