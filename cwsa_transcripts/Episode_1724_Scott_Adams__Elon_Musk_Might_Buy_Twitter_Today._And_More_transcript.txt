i'm talking directly to you
get ready for the simultaneous sip the
rest of you can join in too
with barbara go
and that ladies and gentlemen
yes
i'm sorry i just read a funny comment on
the local platform
now
let me tell you a little story
and here's why
today i looked at the news to prepare
for my award-winning
well not yet but i think he had
award-winning uh
live stream and i said to myself
well it's sort of a sort of a thin news
day
but yet you expect
nearly 45 minutes of quality
entertainment
and i was just talking to the locals
platform before i signed on to youtube
and i said hmm
challenge to see if i could come up with
a story
that would be useful
you know you would actually get
something from it and it would fill in
the time
because with less than 15 seconds to go
i didn't have enough content to go more
than 10 minutes
but
why is it that i wasn't worried
whatsoever
well how many times have i told you i
took the dale carnegie course it was
just the most awesome thing
one of the many things you learn
is to be prepared
to give a speech at any time
isn't that weird
that's such a specific skill isn't it
you should be prepared
to give a speech
anytime just somebody might say scott
could you stand up and give us a few
words and you'd be like look so you
should be prepared
now
let me tell you a story where this
mattered
a number of years ago i was doing a book
tour
where you go around the country to
various big book stores and you sign a
lot of copies of your book
and one of the big stores i went to was
in denver i think it was a not just a
bookstore it was almost like a complex
it was like a major bookstore plus
operation
and so you usually have a handler
and your handler goes with you and takes
you to the various places you have to
visit for interviews and whatever
and the handler and i walk in and the
the
manager of the bookstore greets us is
all excited that i'm there and says oh
we're so happy that you're here
um
people have been uh waiting in for your
speech for over an hour
and i said
my what
they said your your talk
people are really excited about your
talk
and i said
my what
my what it sounded like you said talk
they said yeah your talk that you're
gonna give the the room is full it's an
overflow capacity can't believe how many
people showed up
and i said
the room
the talk the what
i thought i was just there to sign books
and she goes yeah and she takes me to
the room and opens the door and there's
this enormous auditorium full of people
who are waiting for my talk
that i had no idea i was giving until i
showed up
now
what happened
well i took the deli
i may have mentioned
because i took the dale carnegie course
i had a speech
and so i just gave it
that was it
and
so i'm demonstrating to you
what i learned in the dale carnegie
course
so because i was light on material
i always have like a little bag of uh
stories
that have some useful point to them so
my useful point is it is really really
useful
to have a little bag of stories
and you might want to have one that's
sort of something about your company or
one that's like an interesting thing you
would tell
you know if you were
asked to be interesting at a party you
just have
five stories
that you that you could just whip out in
a minute
very useful
there you go
now um let's talk about immigration
rasmussen had a little poll
and uh
35 percent of people they polled adult
you know likely voter types
support the trend of rising illegal
immigration
so 35 percent of the people who vote
or likely to vote
more than a third
are in favor of increasing illegal
activity
specifically immigration
would you have guessed it was that high
it's funny that they say illegal
immigration now if the question had been
should we increase
immigration
then i could see a third of the people
saying yeah you know in my opinion we
should have more immigration i could
understand somebody having that opinion
i don't really know what the right
number of immigrants is there's some
number that's good
there's some number that's too little
too few
because we actually almost certainly
need some kind of immigrant flow
but there's some number that's too big
i don't know what that number is
anyway and so for some reason we all
avoid the only thing that matters
which is
what would be the right number
and right composition you know of
educated versus laborer types
so
um but anyway
more than a third of the country
supports the illegal type of immigration
so i guess they would they would imagine
it should be legal i suppose would be
the interpretation
including 19 who strongly support it
they're like really in favor of the
illegal kind of immigration
12 percent not so sure
um so a majority 53 percent of democrats
support the trend of record-setting
illegal immigration
but 75 percent of republicans say no and
54 of voters
not affiliated with either party say no
i guess
so
i wonder if this is part of the larger
trend
that conservatives like to be in charge
of their
family situation
and
the people that are furthest on the left
are more in favor of a takes a village
the school can raise your kid
kind of thing it just seems like more of
that
because
um if you wanted to like you know
protect your family
you could imagine that you might say
less immigration
because it might have some you know
impact on your family but if you were
like you know everybody is a village
then you'd say hey it doesn't matter who
you are
come on in we'll figure it out
collectively
so i guess that makes sense
philosophically that they would think
that but i can't imagine
well let me let me give you my
overall philosophy of all these things
whenever there's a question of
individual benefit
cost or benefit versus protecting a
system
if the system is a really important one
i generally favor the system
take for example
capitalism
i think capitalism works better than the
alternatives but has all these problems
pretty bad problems you know lots of
inequality blah blah blah
but still
if it came to a choice of making
everybody equal
or having capitalism with all his flaws
i would support the system because the
system is what gets you to the
the most people getting the most benefit
over the longest period of time
same with free speech
you come up with lots of examples where
you say i don't like that free speech
but still
you're better off supporting the system
that free speech exists despite all of
its
horrible flaws according to you
so immigration is the
same thing
it feels as if the democrats are looking
at it as
sort of a human
individual human suffering kind of
situation which it is
it's 100
exactly that
it's about human suffering and human
condition
but
if you
if you take the very
and i i have respect for the position
if you have the empathy that you can't
release yourself from caring about the
individuals
and saying you know if they can make it
to the border let's just do what we can
to help them
that's great empathy and as a human
being i would actually
probably quite appreciate you you're the
kind of person i would want as a friend
that you have that much empathy that you
really can't see the system
beyond the individual suffering
that's somewhat
is a somewhat worthy
kind of
respectable position even if you don't
hold it you'd have to say
you can't haze somebody
who can't look past individual suffering
to see the system
but i guess i'm a worse person because i
can do that
so in my opinion
most people would be best off
with systems that have integrity so i'd
like to see the immigration system work
legally
and effectively and then separately
once you have your immigration
completely controlled
then you have a separate conversation
about what's the right amount
and you do it logically
you do it in the way that supports the
most benefit for the most people
which almost certainly would be um
america first
in other words keeping america strong
has a ripple effect
of protecting the entire
continent right
do you think south america is better off
because the united states is strong
you don't even need much of a military
in south america because who's going to
attack south america
nobody's going to take a run on south
america because america is so strong
so
it's hard to separate what is good for
america and its strength and how that
benefits other countries you know is
japan
uh better off for having an american
defensive umbrella over there probably
problem
all right
breaking news um
maybe it's already happened but uh
apparently elon musk has gotten further
than we imagined
or some imagined and he's raised the
money and it looks like they could make
a deal
twitter and elon musk today
so there might actually be an
announcement today
that elon musk is buying twitter and
it's going through
now i'm a little skeptical
it seems a little too easy
were any of you expecting it to be this
easy
and it could be that the threat of
uh
lawsuits was big enough that the board
just said i were out
which would be pretty rational
pretty rational
i should mention that i own some twitter
stock
so
i guess it would be good for me if he
buys it
although i would have held it longer
than
you know that but yeah so it isn't my
i suppose as an investor it wasn't
exactly my preference but as a
as an american i guess
you know i guess i like the
benefit to free speech
um
speaking of elon musk
uh it makes me think of bill gates
there's a meme
that's being fact-checked so reuters
facts and others
are saying it's not true
and the photo has been doctored there's
a photo of bill gates crossing the
street in which he has enormous breasts
now i'm not talking about his just
unflattering photos that you've seen
i'm talking about actually photoshopped
gigantic breasts
and
the
and reuters felt the need to fact check
that
because
there would be some people who imagined
he had transitioned and he had enormous
breasts
but it's not true it is not true
he has only average sized breasts
so if you thought that
bill gates had enormous breasts
totally untrue they're larger than
average
they're healthy sized
all right um
speaking of freedom
once elon musk
buys twitter
and returns free speech
to all of us
which i think we would all applaud i
think the first order of business is she
he should ban disney from the platform
uh because
i love free speech
but disney am i right
let me those guys
so
i do like free speech but with the
exception of stuff i don't like
so i will make an exception
so um i have been convinced by the
people on the internet who have made a
good argument lots of times i don't
change my mind
i don't change my mind but this is this
is one of those cases where
when you're faced with a superior
argument
i think you have to fold to it
and so the argument i've been presented
with the last several days
is that yeah free speech is great
unless it's something you really really
don't like and then it starts
interfering with the actual workings of
the government
and
if yours free speech is the kind that
actually matters
the kind that would change something
that that's extra dangerous
so the kind of speech that
i think
free speech should allow
is the kind that agrees with all my
personal views
but beyond that
i'd really like to see stuff banned
so i'm hoping elon musk will just start
banning the stuff i don't like
because otherwise i don't think i could
support this
as a stockholder i'd have to vote
against it i needed him in there banning
 i don't want
uh because
if if people start giving their opinions
then things will happen i don't like
and that would be
weak
and i don't want to be weak
so i want to be strong and violate the
constitution
for things that i like and things i want
okay some of you can't even tell what
i'm kidding can you how many of you
don't know
that i'm not serious
raise your hand
come on raise your hand
all right
well
um
i am hearing some terrible arguments
about the disney thing but are you all
bored with that
is everybody done with the disney story
because here's what i think happened
i think
i think i would say hey free speech
isn't more important than these things
then people would say
are you a groomer and i'd say
oh i don't even think that's the right
conversation
and then i'd say hey free speech is
still important and somebody would say
but disney's deal is
is uh better than other corporations and
i'd say
i don't even think that's the topic
and that so i don't know if i ever even
had a real conversation about it because
you couldn't get anybody to even stick
to the topic it was like well what about
this other thing all right
so there's nothing there for us to talk
about i guess
um
here's
but let me give you one useful
um let's say lesson
a micro lesson on analysis
and
this is the probably the most important
thing
that economists or people
trained in that or people who have you
know business training
get right
that people who don't have that kind of
training get wrong and don't know that
is wrong
it's what i call the comparison problem
if you compare the wrong things
you're obviously going to come to a
wrong conclusion
right
so one of the things that i heard the
most from but only from people who don't
have good comparison skills
is that disney was getting a sweetheart
deal
compared to other corporations and why
should they get like the extra deal
that's not the right comparison
if you're comparing disney to any other
corporation
that's completely nonsensical you might
as well compare them to a grapefruit
well
a grapefruit doesn't get a good deal
so why does disney it wouldn't make any
sense just because they're a corporation
and something else is a corporation
that doesn't mean they should be
compared for everything
here's the comparison you should make
how many gigantic corporations who could
credibly credibly
go to a state and say we can bring in 60
000 employees
and millions of
of
uh travelers to your state which you
want to be a destination for travel so
our business is right on point with what
you want to be it will bring in gigantic
revenue for you and what we would like
in return for the efficiency of building
it primarily just for efficiency so that
you and i can get our benefits as soon
as possible
uh how about we have some autonomy
and that autonomy will have a certain
length deal
in the beginning
this will be like really good for us but
also really good for you because you're
getting this this all this economic
development
so
and on and on so the the correct
comparison is this
disney
and what they asked florida for compared
to
the other company they asked florida for
the same thing and could offer the same
benefit in return
that's the only comparison
if you compared anything else then
you're not well trained in comparing
because if florida would have said no to
another company that offered something
similarly as awesome
well then you'd say okay well why is
disney getting the special deal if
somebody else made the same offer
shouldn't they get the same
consideration and the answer is yes
yes they should
that's exactly what they should get
so if two companies had made this offer
to florida florida should have accepted
both
if three companies made that offer
florida should have accepted all three
have i made
have i sold you that everybody who said
other corporations didn't get this deal
just
they're not right or wrong
it's not a question of right or wrong
it's not even the right
comparison
it's like comparing it to a grapefruit
it has no relevance whatsoever
okay
and that
ladies and gentlemen
is the useful part of our program we're
now to the the part where i either have
to tell you an interesting story
possibly one that you prompted me for
or
we may be ending early which would be a
tragedy for all of us i think you'd
agree
and while you're thinking what you would
like
me to tell you in terms of a story
or possibly
if you'd like me to heal anybody from
any problems
i will be taking this gratuitous extra
sip
and uh and watching your comments
uh mushrooms
is the question
am i am i mad at you no i'm not bad at
you
um more about mushrooms
well
that does seem to be the issue of the
day doesn't
but i worry that i've talked about it
too much
i'll just i'll just give you the basic
idea
which is uh
i thought i tried some recently but i
don't think they were actually
they were either inert or something
so i don't have any recent experience
with it my first experience i thought
changed me forever
so i don't know what's going on
i don't know why once it was
a profound life-changing experience and
the second time it wasn't but one
possibility is that
i'd already changed
i worry about that
i mean i don't worry about it but i
suppose that would be good
yeah why would i want to change again
exactly
google education what's that
uh shellenberger's chances in the
election
strangely good
yeah michael schellenberger running as
an independent with you know he's
written books on everything from
homelessness how a had to deal with that
drug addiction
energy policy
directly related to california he's
researched you know forest fire stuff
basically the water problem every
problem is specific to california he's
actually become an expert on and he's an
insanely good communicator and persuader
so
could he he actually does have a lane
i think the difference between
me saying he has a really high chance
and
predicting he actually will win
is what the media does
because he is so media friendly like he
can he can appear on media left and
right because he's an independent so
he's not locked down of either media
think about that
just think about that
who who who is the last person who is
smart enough to figure out how to stake
out a position
in which cnn and fox news would both be
equally happy to have you as a guest
name one other person who has
accomplished that
can you
now oh
andrew yang okay
well trump for a while and then he even
gave up arnold actually actually
arnold's pretty good
uh arnold is good
all right so i guess there are a few but
uh mark cuban but you know
i'm not he's not as political
uh as he could be
yeah elon musk
right but they're not political remember
so i'm talking about somebody actually
running for office
who would be just as desired on the left
and right and here's the reason
what makes news
is is not just doing something well
that's not news
because people are doing things at
various levels of quality all the time
it can't all be news
what's news is something somebody does
something a different way
and that's the thing he's got
and the different way is so obviously
superior
it's a different way that literally
nobody can argue with
like what would be the argument against
him having a deep knowledge
and best-selling books on exactly the
topic
that you're trying to solve
now you could argue you don't like his
solution
but you can't argue against that being a
better process like having somebody
who's really
shown by his own production the work
he's produced and the activism i mean
he's been directly on the streets
working on fentanyl and stuff
so
if you were to design a perfect
candidate
that candidate would be you know
tall and good looking and have great
hair
jack
yeah you those things shouldn't matter
right
it shouldn't matter that you're tall and
good-looking you have a great hair
but it does it does sorry it does
um
probably one of the best communicators
that i've ever seen as a as a politician
he's got that so now combine just those
two things
if that's all you had if all you had was
the look
and you were one of the best
communicators anybody had ever seen
you'd probably get elected to stuff
right
but on top of that
he already demonstrated by writing
several best-selling books
a deep knowledge of everything from
you know climate change and energy and
nuclear power
homelessness addiction literally exactly
the issues that the state is dealing
with nobody's ever put together a talent
stack like that
so if you ever saw a if anybody writes
stories if this ever happens
if the media ever says what does a
perfect politician look like
if you're going to build one the only
thing he doesn't have is a uh
ethnic
um signature that california might want
you know he doesn't have the
you know
the ethnicity or the gender or whatever
it takes
do you think that will be held against
him
probably
probably but here's the thing
he's not a republican
i think it would definitely be held
against him if he were a republican
but remember gavin newsom is the most
popular candidate in the in the state
which doesn't seem to make sense does it
but the reason gavin newsom could be
a good-looking white guy with good hair
and still be popular in california
is because he's so
pro the things that
people want
and schellenberger has like a better
version of that
he is pro what the people want with a
demonstrated uh base of understanding
that says he knows how to get it
that's even stronger if he can sell that
and he's probably one of the few people
who could because he has those skills so
if you see
if you see like a major
here would be the turning point if you
saw a major
media piece let's say wall street
journal new york times
describing how he's running
the process
and also maybe some of his policies for
those specific things if you see that
it means that
that the major media is now paying
attention and the way it works is you
need at least one major publication
to say something is the right frame or
is the right story
and then all the others just fall in
line
the stories don't make themselves
the stories are made by the big
publications and then everybody else
says well that's the story because there
are a million things you could talk
about
but the big publications tell you what
you will talk about because everybody
falls in line
right so there's the there's the canary
in the coal mine for you if you see one
uh if you see something like new york
times
like a real profile that's positive
and or wall street general or washington
post i guess
so if you see any of those three maybe
maybe some of the other media
doing a major piece and they talk about
how he's doing it
instead of
you know a hip piece which you'd
normally see
or a love letter i mean if they just
don't if they're just objective about it
then i think he's gonna be president you
know i'm not sure how many of you would
have guessed that arnold schwarzenegger
would be
you know governor of california or
ronald reagan
you know we do like entertainers
but we also are willing we mean in
california
we're willing to look at anything that
looks like a good deal
in the end
you know i'm not you know as much as i
and other people say oh it's about your
ethnicity
because everybody's woke in california
or it's about your gender or whatever
even though it largely is
all of that goes away
if the candidate is good enough it just
all melts away because that's what gavin
newsom did
i mean all of that stuff didn't matter
to him
because he was a good enough candidate
that's all he needed he schwarzenegger
too schwarzenegger was a good enough
candidate that he just evaporated those
other concerns
so if all newspapers supports them we'll
all fall in line
no
[Laughter]
that's the so tell for
cognitive
uh
it's been a while since i mentioned this
so some of you are new
when you see somebody
mischaracterize what you just said
starting with the word so
so
you're saying that all lizards can fly
whatever comes after that word so
will definitely not be what you're
saying
and it's a sign that the person
uh their own argument has fallen apart
so when somebody responds with a so
you've already won
you could actually just walk away go oh
there it is
victory there's the so
and the first time i ever tell you let
tell you that you think
what
you can actually tell when you've won an
argument by that one word
really
really that one word you put it in front
of a sentence and that and that's that's
all it takes
you don't even need to know what the
rest of the sentences got
seriously
yes
yes seriously
when you start looking for it
you'll see it so clearly
yeah all of this so what you're saying
is
is a guarantee that you just won the
argument
because
and here's why
if somebody still had an argument they
would have used it
they wouldn't have to mischaracterize
what you're saying
they would simply use what you're saying
and say well here's why why the thing
you're saying doesn't make sense if they
had an argument otherwise they go so
what you're saying is that
uh even hitler would be okay as your
roommate is that what you said no no
nobody's saying that no
it's not good for
what all right let's see if i can
uh my claim that my oh so somebody's
saying that my claim that my bad
experience with what i thought were
mushrooms
uh for me to say that maybe it wasn't
actually active mushrooms
is cognitive dissonance
possible
but there's no trigger for it
in other words i could be wrong or i
could be right but cognitive dissonance
would require that there was something
about my prior opinions
that this would violate and nothing like
that happened
so there's nothing that could have
changed my mind there's just some
knowledge that i'm lacking which is what
was in it
now
some have said
that the difference between a good trip
and a bad trip if you can call it that
on mushrooms
would be you know how much you like that
basically but in both cases it would be
a
a i guess psychedelic or mildly
mildly psychedelic effect and i didn't
have any
so
uh if you take something in the higher
dose range and you don't have any effect
i'm not sure you'd call that a bad trip
all i had was a really bad stomach ache
that lasted 24 hours
could be just stale yeah maybe
who knows
um
so
i don't think
i i think that there was something else
going on
and two people had the same experience
at the same time so
i i doubt that
i doubt that both had exactly the same
unusual experience
so anyway there's not much to say about
that because i don't i don't have enough
information about what it was that i
ingested
um
it wasn't micro dosing
so those of you who think i didn't take
enough
uh i
i followed the directions
i definitely took it off
but if this doesn't tell you to not do
drugs nothing will
um
it's interesting the the variety of
experiences people have had it's really
interesting
yeah so apparently people have had
experiences all over the place but
i suspect it's because
i i think we're thinking that the
difference is in us
and i think that's probably an illusion
because there's no quality control for
this particular
illegal drug
so
if there's no quality control
it has probably has more to do with the
product than some state you're in
so my guess is that you could be in a
bad state and it would put you in a good
mood
if you got the good stuff
and if you were in a bad mood and you
got the bad stuff you'd think it was
because your mood but maybe it was just
a bad bag of stuff who knows
who knows
what do you think of woke corporations
well
um isn't today's wokeness
tomorrow's uh
um let's say
on the same side of history
it's hard to look at stuff in the
present because all that matters is how
we're going to look at it in a year or
10 years
and
you know i i try to take myself back and
say okay what would it have been like
when corporations were saying we're
going to try to make sure
we have more diversity
today that sounds pretty routine doesn't
it
that sounds pretty well that's just
normal why wouldn't they
it's good for them good for the public
yeah they should put some effort into
that
let's give us some diversity
now
if if you go too hard on that you know
you can it's just discrimination
but there's probably some way to do it
that's only a little bit discriminatory
but gets you some benefits maybe
so if you look at that
if you looked at it when it was
happening
it just looked like ogne has gone too
far because i was in the middle of it
when it did happen i lost two jobs
because i was a white male
so when that happened i said to myself
well that's terrible
it's an overreaction why are these
companies being forced to be so woke and
you know why can't i just do a good job
and get promoted for my for my abilities
you know why did why did my ethnicity
have to even be an issue
so that's what i thought at the time
but because of those and other efforts
corporations are
more diverse than they used to be
and so you look at it in
with now a historical view of it
and even i
who as i said lost two jobs
for being a white guy and i was told
that directly by my bosses by the way
at a large bank and then at the phone
company
so i'm not guessing
you know it's not a conspiracy theory my
boss in both places said
sorry we won't be able to promote you
because you're white and male
i hated it
but now i look at it you know 30 years
of distance in the past and i say to
myself
you know
i don't know
if if that's the only way you could have
gotten here
and things do look better
in in that one sense diversity has
improved
i don't know
it's hard for me to judge it as harshly
as i judged it when it was
it was literally screwing me
so
so the first thing you have to do is say
what would it look like in a few years
and and one possibility
is that in 10 years you're gonna say
oh yeah um what disney was fighting for
was mischaracterized
because don't you think both sides are
mischaracterized
when you look at the the disney thing
and desantis and the don't say gay
both sides mischaracterize the other
one's point right
that's why
it's just a stupid debate
it's really just power
you know it's people doing what they can
because they can because it feels like
power and it gives them a dopamine hit
but basically it's just two liars facing
off with each other it's hard for me to
take sides with liars
sometimes you have to
i know what you're going to say
sometimes you have to
but i don't like to do it if if i could
avoid it
like even if the liar is on my side
i don't really want to side with a liar
not really
but
it's entirely possible that the only way
desantis can prevail
and the people on their side is to
let's say exaggerate what's going on
exaggeration is persuasion and i'm
always in favor of persuasion for a good
point
so
you know there's this line where you go
from hyperbole to just flat out lying
and this whole this whole topic is just
to me it looks like people lie into each
other so i feel a little a little bit
like the only part i want to talk about
is freedom of speech
and that's why people keep getting mad
at me because i'm not i'm not dealing
with the the issue
and the reason i'm not is because it's
just two sides lying
what am i going to add to that
there's nothing to add to that just stay
away from it run away
now but the only thing i would add is
that
if you think that disney is trying to
hurry your children
what the hell
they're not trying to hurt
they're tr
i i think i can say this with great
certainty
the disney's intention is not to hurt
children
they have a different opinion of what it
looks like to
to help them i guess and help everybody
else
it's just a difference of opinion
now
um conservatives
consistently say that the family should
be in charge of stuff like that
and if you have a
see here's here's why i think there's a
difference conservatives are so strong
family oriented
that once you start with the assumption
okay start with a strong family
and then does it make sense
that the family has more
decision making and influence than the
school
yes it does
if you start with the assumption of a
strong family
then other assumptions follow for that
but if you're
let's say on the left
and you don't have an assumption that
strong families are necessary or even
needed
then
it doesn't make sense
that families have the power
because if you're a
weak family structure
there's sort of nobody to make the right
decision no way to make it stick
you might as well let the school do it
now
second question is
if the school's going to do it whatever
it is
how do they do it right as opposed to
making things worse
so
here's where
i think you need to just to understand
the decision
if you think there's a right and a wrong
decision on this
family's deciding
versus the schools deciding what to tell
kids
there's no right or wrong
there's only what's right for some types
of families
if you have a strong family structure
and two capable parents
then it's absolutely better for the
family to to inform the kids
would everybody agree with that
statement so far
that so far
if if you have a capable parental
structure
they should have the maximum amount of
control over the children that's the
best outcome
because they're really capable by
definition that's the setup
but now but now let me change it
let's say you've got one parent doesn't
matter the gender you've got one parent
it wasn't anybody's fault
maybe you know things happen
parent is overworked
isn't isn't good at communicating
isn't comfortable with some topics maybe
doesn't even understand some topics and
really can't educate the kid
you can't educate them right can't
educate them wrong just can't just
doesn't have the capability
what is the best situation for that
person
is it the best situation for that kid
to be educated by that one parent who
doesn't have any ability to get it right
no i'm not judging right this is not
don't interpret this as racial or
anything else
just some parents are better than other
parents
across all types
so
in a situation where you have a
completely useless parent
i don't know would the school do a worse
job of raising the kid
who's ever studied that
and how do you know if that parent is so
bad
so
when i say i agree with conservatives
about the parents
making the choice
i do
but you have to understand that's only
good for people with strong
family belief structures and willing to
really make that work it's definitely
better for them
but
one size doesn't fit all
so you can see why people who have seen
the other kind of life where the the
family structure is just
you know broken everywhere
you can see why they say you don't let
the school do it because there's no
family to do anything here
i can see that
um but
as a system which is better
and the system that's better is that the
parents do it
if they demand it
that's the better system
so
you know
ultimately it's going to be down to
power
so whoever's whoever has the most power
will win
and it looks like desantis
is probably going to win
so that's how that's how the system
works
all right
um what percent of parents are
completely useless good question i will
put that to the audience
what percentage of parents
would you say are above the line of
capable wherever
above the line of capable
all right so we're this will be the
capable number not the incapable
how many are capable somebody's saying
75 percent of parents are capable but
others 30.
see that that probably informs your
opinion of who should be in charge right
if
if you thought only 25
parents were even capable
you might lean toward well let the
school do it
because you know you don't want to ruin
75 of kids
yeah and i guess we don't know and
everybody would have a different idea of
what capable looks like etc
and
but i'll tell you my observation is the
school raises your kid no matter what
so that
i guess part of the reason that i'm a
little less engaged in this topic
is that if you
if you've observed children at all
if they go to school
if they go to public school because
that's a separate option right
you know a lot of people would like to
have their option of taking them to a
private school or a different school but
if they go to public school the school
raises your kid
there's nothing you could do about it
and it's their friends who do it
do you know all that uh sexuality stuff
that you want
the parent to teach
it's coming from their friends
you know the parents can try
hey let me sit you down and
tell you all about this lgbtq stuff kids
when you're old enough
by the time by the time your parents sit
you down and talk to you your kids your
the kids friends have already completely
indoctrinated them into whatever the
hell they believe
now the good news is that the whole
lgbtq thing is is very accepted
in younger than the younger generation
so it's almost a non-issue it's more
like a curiosity but it's not like a
judgment sort of thing for them
where'd they get that did they get that
from the school did they get that from
their parents no
most parents don't say anything
most schools don't say anything except
i'll give you an example when i went to
school a million years ago
we had a art teacher who was
i'm going to say obviously gay
could i be wrong yeah i suppose i could
have been wrong and everybody in the
town could have been wrong and that fine
young man that he lived with
could have been just a friend maybe
i mean
but
trust me on this i had a gay art teacher
now
this was well be well before wokeness
but i have to say it probably normalized
it for me
just by example
just just the fact that he existed
and uh he wasn't fired for any
people people made unkind remarks behind
his back of course in those days
but i think it normalized it so all
you have to be
you have to be sort of humble about what
a parent could even do to a kid
because the kids are just seeing
examples of stuff and talking to their
friends
that's got to be 75 of it plus genetics
if you take the kids genetic
propensities
they're peer pressure
and just the stuff that they're
observing on tv and everywhere else
that's
90 percent
of their socialization
and the parents might be 10
about
pick up you know clean your room and
show up on time
that's about it
but despite the minimal impact that i
think parents actually have on that
specific kind of a question
i think the system works better when the
parents have have that power and not the
state
whenever you can make that happen
because one of the choices that the
parent could make is oh let the school
do it
so maybe that's just choice or you know
wait a few years when the kid is longer
older and the school could do it
but really i guess the question is more
about the age it's happening isn't it
it's not even so much
was your gay teacher an ideologue
doesn't matter to the story
and he was by the way he was
had a big impact on me
obviously since i'm in art
so i would say he was one of the one of
my teachers who probably had one of the
biggest positive impacts on me
all
right um
and uh let's see let's talk about uh
ukraine have you noticed that the
ukraine story
starting to turn into
well those ukrainians might be able to
destroy enough soviet
ura weapons that the russians are using
that ukrainians could actually win
so the major media is starting to
suggest
that those ukrainians have pretty good
weapons and they're getting trained in
new weapon systems that maybe we don't
know all all the details about
and that
the russians are being at least stopped
or repelled
now here's the interesting thing about
the ukraine situation to me
and i i hate the fact that war is
interesting but i can't help it
uh
the
the outcome is going to depend on
tipping points meaning that there's
going to be a whole bunch of stuff in
the context of war
that get gets really close to a failure
point
but doesn't necessarily fail
but if any one of those things that is
like coming right to the failure point
fails then then you have a result for
example
how much equipment could russia lose as
a percentage of its let's say big
equipment
before it wouldn't be functional
25
because it might have lost 25 already
40
if they lost 40 of their big equipment
would they say oh
we're gonna lose
you know all of it if we just keep doing
this like at what point would they say
uh we have not gained any territory and
we're now down to only 60 of our army
or whatever
so we ukraine might actually be close
to some kind of a tipping point
militarily
maybe
now what about supply lines
we never hear about the ukrainian supply
lines do we we only hear that there are
problems with the russian supply lines
could be because the locals are
providing food and channels to get it
etc who knows
but
both of those are near a tipping point
there's got to be a tipping point where
one of the armies will run out of fuel
one of them runs out of
bullets runs out of probably not bullets
but runs out of uh food
there's got to be a tipping point right
and
um how many drones would it take
before ukraine is clearly going to win
well they've got several hundred coming
is that enough
i actually think several hundred could
be close to a tipping point
if it were ten thousand i'd say okay
that's enough they're gonna win if they
were trained to use them and you know
they were deployed
it's not going to be 10 000 but it might
be a thousand
if you had if you had a thousand good
drones and
let's say 50 of them were reusable types
not not suicide types
i feel like that would push it over the
tipping point
so
anyone who says that there's some
obvious way that this is going to go i
think that's the worst prediction
the worst prediction is that anything
obvious is going to happen
because it's all about these little
tipping points and none of those are
predictable
any one of those could go
and just collapse the whole situation
can you get a micro lesson on flirting
okay
all right i'll give you a micro lesson
on flirting
um
do everything you can to not have to
so
if you're flirting and that's like
that's the way you're going to win
if that's all you got
you're probably already lost
a better strategy would be to work on
your fitness and your style and make
sure your hair cut and your skin looks
good and
uh you know you're doing everything you
can
to present yourself
as something that somebody would want
because if you do that
then flirting can be reduced to
hi
i'm bob
that's it
if you get the big stuff right
the flirting is just high smile make eye
contact
uh
do you know do you know how a woman can
flirt let me tell you a woman can flirt
i'm going to give you my impression
which will be horrifying this is going
to be horrifying
my impression of a woman
flirting with
maximum like just full force
this is full on flirting
hi
that's it
done
direct eye contact
and a smile
you're done
[Laughter]
almost every guy will think i think
she's into me
i remember for a time my local grocery
store
was forcing the employees
to act extra nice to the customers it
was like a corporate thing
so you'd go in there and they'd be like
how are you you know a nice day it was
like a little over the top
not long after that
they never could hire an attractive
female cashier
do you know why
because it felt like they were hitting
on you
and i think that they probably all got
hit on back
because so so if the if this 65 year old
guy with weird hair at the cash register
says hey how you doing you just think
he's friendly
but if the 28 year old
you know attractive looking woman says
looks at you directly and says hi how's
your day
do you know what every guy thinks
i think she's into me a little bit that
feels like flirting and it probably was
a problem so basically
you know the the attractive female
cashier
demographic just disappeared from that
store and never came back
i don't know why unless it was that
now
men of course would be harder to flirt
but like i said you just have to present
yourself
as confident
primarily
have a job and a gym membership
you're done
right be confident
have a job
and a gym membership
and things will probably work out for
you
that's about it
oh and interested yes
well the
the best way to
show interest is
to be interested
to ask people about their situation
especially if it's a bad situation if
you show empathy by the way this is the
best definition of
charisma
i've mentioned this before but it's
worth it again
charisma i heard it defined once as
a combination of power plus empathy
and when you first hear that you're like
how does that work
why is that and i'll explain it if you
saw somebody who had power
but no empathy in other words they
didn't care about you they would
literally be dangerous
or feel dangerous you wouldn't want that
person in charge
because they don't care about you and
they have all this power that's the
worst possible situation
you wouldn't want necessarily to hang
out with somebody who had plenty of
empathy
but no power
because you're probably going to end up
helping them
right now you might like lp people but
in terms of a leader
you want somebody who has ability you
don't have
but also cares about you
now that goes to
flirting especially male flirting
so if you're male
you have to demonstrate some kind of
power
the power could be
confidence
money position
it could be just your physicality
something like that that's your power
and so it doesn't have to be real direct
power has to be like the impression of
power
right just the impression however you
want to sell that
so you create the
impression of power and then you combine
that with interest and
empathy and and instead of using your
power to get what you want
you say how can i help you
what can i do for you
how was your day
oh and then show actual interest now
if you're faking it it doesn't work
and people can see through you know
falsehood
but
if you actually do care about people
excuse me it would work fine
so the best flirting you can do is to be
charismatic
show you have some kind of power
uh you're genetically
you know gifted if if you are
uh you're
you're strong
maybe because you made yourself that way
or you're successful and somehow you've
got to project that in some way that
other people can see without you
bragging
and then act empathetic and you're done
boom but if you do the overly flirty
flirty thing
that's too much now i'll also tell you
that a compliment
if it's given sincerely and confidently
can act like a flirt
while being
well being just matter of fact
so if you do it right
people will accept the compliment as
intended it'll have a big impact but you
don't have to be
you know
have a let's say
a begging simp like approach to doing it
you could just say
just give your opinion
all right
i believe that i have now
accomplished the impossible
made a fascinating
wow
hour-long
presentation
without any content whatsoever
and uh
maybe improve some of your days you
don't know
i don't know
so we'll see
some of you we're going to say it's the
best live stream ever i know i know
some don't but i will talk to you
tomorrow in any case
see you tomorrow
