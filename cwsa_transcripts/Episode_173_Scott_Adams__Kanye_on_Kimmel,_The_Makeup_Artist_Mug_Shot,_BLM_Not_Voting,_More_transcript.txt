well I look lovely in this color of
shirt I just noticed I think it accents
my
eyes um come on in here Janet Tyler
JP I see you Tom Donna
Carrie make sure you got your mugs your
vessels your glasses your
cups and they're full of the beverage of
your choice
yes the best SIP of your entire day it's
coming up and you know how exciting that
is join me now for the simultaneous
sip oh it's always sweeter before the
weekend so my favorite story in this
slow news day today is a super slow news
day and you'll you'll know by the
stories that I talk about the first one
was did you see the story it's on the
Fox News
website about the woman who was uh
busted for
marijuana but her makeup in her mug shot
was so good that there was a viral
campaign to free her so that she can
give makeup tips did you hear that one
now I saw the headline that you know so
there was a mug shot and it was so good
people were asking her for tips and I
thought to
myself well I don't know anything about
makeup but you
know you have to see it you won't be
able to see it on my on my screen there
but I opened it up
and I thought to
myself well how good can her makeup
be if you know two over 200,000 people
forwarded it or tweeted it or whatever
they did to ask her for makeup tips and
I opened the picture and I
thought holy
cow she she's really good at makeup
because you know I don't know anything
and even I can tell her makeup is
amazing uh she's doing something with
her eyes that matches her shirt and I'm
thinking oh my God this is it was really
good so that's the it looks like she's
going to have a career out of getting
arrested because she's so good at
makeup oh which is
hilarious uh um yeah then apparently
there were some uh I didn't watch
football last night but apparently there
were some players who either did they
kneel or did they just raise their fists
in the air but a few people protested
and the president's response was
predictable but not that harsh so
remember how you know originally the
very first comment that I think really
got everybody's attention was when he
was out of rally and he was in rally
mode you know his rally personality is
the the attenuated one it's like bigger
than real life it's more theatrical and
in his rally personality the president
said that you know uh something about
you should fire those sons of
 and today the today his
complaint is going all the way to uh you
know uh just hey be happy you know chill
out be happy just play the game cost a
lot for the those tickets you know the
the tone of the uh complaint went from
Defcon 10 to how you doing how you doing
today and maybe we shouldn't yeah think
about it take it under
advisement so it's so even the president
couldn't get couldn't get worked up
about it it was so it was so
irrelevant now
um I I have a
prediction that I think will agree with
probably many of you that I can't see
football lasting in the long run only
because of the head injuries when I say
only because of the head injuries head
injuries are really bad so it's not I'm
not minimizing that it's a big big big
big big big big big problem that we're
treating like it's it's just a it's an
obstacle um I can't imagine that there
will be football in 20 years that that
would be surprising
um unless they figure out some new
technology to protect
heads now uh I tweeted just before I got
on
that uh Hawk
Nome has has announced that at least his
his folks who are part of black lives
matter greater New York area are talking
about not
voting so they're actually promoting
that black lives matter not vote for the
perfectly good reason that neither side
is is uh giving them what they think
they
want well what they do want you don't
think you want something you just want
it or you don't um and I thought to
myself well that is interesting because
if all they did was change their vote
you know sort of silently just go to the
polls and vote differently I don't know
if it would make that much
difference but declaring that you won't
vote in in a context where you
know uh the the
African-American voters were not always
even able to vote you know they they
didn't even have the right to vote uh
for our entire
history so that's kind of a good play in
terms of getting attention and get in
terms of making the point you know if
you if you counted up the total number
of black lives
matter folks who will be part of this I
don't know how big that would be um
probably probably not gigantic but in
terms of getting attention it's really
clever and probably uh will'll get some
attention I saw it in an article so
obviously the Press likes this and
that's part of the game you got to get
attention before you can
persuade um somebody says there's no
valid point for black lives
matter yeah their uh their
brand has not has not been as useful as
You'
think the trouble is that the brand is
divisive it's hard it's hard to uh it's
hard to
promote um
togetherness from a brand which is seen
as divisive by its nature so that's a
that's a tough barrier to get
past
um what else is going on today in our
slow news
day uh that was an old article
from two years ago I don't think it was
an old article
48 hours is up oh yes thanks for
reminding me so for those of you who
don't know I have the 48 hour rule when
somebody in the public eye says or does
something that is provocative I say wait
wait wait just let's just wait 48 Hours
the public is demanding
clarifications and maybe the maybe
they'll give it and that we should
accept the
clarification we it's just a better
world if let people clarify you don't
jump on their first statement and say oh
I know what you mean and it's the worst
thing in the world well just give them
48 Hours let them clarify uh the big
tech companies Apple YouTube and
Facebook I believe have not made any
comment with
specificity about why they dropped
Infowars now it's a brutally effective
move on their part because in Wars was
you know unpopular with most of the
country you know the majority probably
and they had specific things to point to
and some of those specific things had to
do with uh children which is sort of the
the ultimate nuclear weapon these
days speaking of the Sandy Hook uh
incident so anything that has to do with
children becomes just more
nuclear
um excuse me
I got to wipe my nose with
Dale
um
so the 48 hours are up and I said that I
would hold my primary comments until
it's over because they they haven't
clarified so now we live in a um we live
in a world in which the big tech
companies can evidently collude so it
was either they talked about it ahead a
time or or or two of them were fast
followers of the others or more of them
I guess Spotify is in it and some others
so it's actually several
platforms um yeah so they either
colluded by talking in advance or they
just followed each other's lead which
ends up being the same thing
and I say can we live in that
world are are you would you be okay
living in a world
where the big tech companies can not
only addict you with their technology
literally turn you turn the society into
blithering uh addicted
robots but can we have them then closing
down parts of speech which they find
unpleasant or untrue or whatever it is
that is offensive about them are you
willing to live in that
world nope you are not neither am I I am
not willing to live in that world and
so um the big tech companies have now
crossed the Rubicon does everybody know
what that means they crossed the Rubicon
that's one of those statements you hear
on TV all the time but if you don't
follow history you don't know what it
means I'm not sure I entirely remember
the details but something about Caesar
before he was a dictator he was a
general and he was outside of Rome the
other side of the Rubicon River and it
was said that if he crossed the Rubicon
the Rubicon River it meant he either had
to conquer Rome with his army and become
the dictator or he would be killed
because you know he had to either win or
die so Crossing the Rubicon means you
can't go back cancelling
Infowars is Crossing the
Rubicon they can't really go back from
that and they've entered a world where
the
public can't can't put up with it
so
um several things could happen at this
point one of those things is that it
could be that the right will take out
some big company on the
left so in our world where mutually
assured disaster is the only thing that
ever
works well that's an exaggeration but
sometimes mutual assured disaster is the
only thing keeping things
stable I'm never in favor of boycotts
and going after commercial Enterprises I
just think it's a bad for
society so this is more of a talking
about the Alternatives than a than a
recommendation but I wouldn't be
surprised if you see some largish not
largish but let's say uh on the small
end of large like Infowars was you know
Infowars isn't Fox News but it's still
large um I wouldn't be surprised if you
see some left leaning medoc site taken
down by people on the right who just
need a
scalp whether it's Huffington Post or
something like that um I don't know what
it would be gawker's already
gone so but I don't know if that's going
to happen I'm not sure I wouldn't
necessarily recommend that uh
but what uh what
recourse do any of us
have you know it's an awkward situation
because many of you don't want to be on
the side of Defending Infowars because
that gets you um associated with
whatever bad thing that you believe they
did
um so what are you going to do well it
seems to me that the only the only
choice is some kind of Regulation and
what's clever
about uh what's clever about what the
tech companies did is that in a
republican
Administration regulating companies is
what nobody wants at least the the group
in power
doesn't
so what do you do what do you
do so right now I don't think there's
any um there's any recourse but let me
say as
um solidly as I
can that I
recommend um government oversight so I
think that in terms of uh maintaining
freedom of
speech even though these big
companies um are private companies and
as private companies they
have rights and they can do what they
want I think we've reached a point where
they've they've they've demonstrated
Monopoly power
if the big platforms can get together
and knock somebody off who is not
violating the
law and not even violating their
internal rules at least in a way that
they've
explained isn't that a
monopoly if that's not a monopoly what
the hell is a monopoly like there's no
such thing as a monopoly if that's not
one and it seems like that is one thing
that a republican Administration can
break they they can break a
monopoly so I would say at this point um
the government does have to be involved
and it does have to insist you know I'm
not sure what they would insist maybe
there's some independent oversight maybe
there's some you know a team of Judges
that looks at cases like this that would
be the easy you know the the
easy solution would be some kind of
regulatory group that just looks at the
exceptions you know let let everything
do what it does but if there's an
exception let it go to um free speech
court or some new thing with three
independent judges who just look at it
and say all right we don't like it
either but it's free speech so you're
back on the
platform um now credit to
Twitter some of you may not want to hear
this but uh Jack dorsy as you know did
decide to keep Alex Jones and infow Wars
on Twitter because they had not violated
Twitter's uh published
guidelines so the the hero in this story
is
Twitter you probably didn't see that
coming did you so Twitter decided to
break with the
pack and come out in favor of free
speech can't hate that you you cannot
hate that
now in terms of Shadow
Banning um that's a more complicated
story and I think that's a wait and see
so the idea is that Twitter is working
to be more transparent about their
algorithms and they've hired some
outside people to help them with that
there was some push back because at
least one of the outside people is so
anti-trump that it looked like it
couldn't possibly be anything but
another way to block conservatives in
disu
but I say wait and see because
transparency is a big part of what
Twitter says they're look they're
working toward so if if the people
working on it are partisan but what they
come up with is
transparency I'm okay with that because
there's no such thing as people who are
you know completely nonpartisan you we
we should just give up on the hope that
you can hire somebody who doesn't have
an opinion about the president of the
United States it's not really a thing
anymore but you can find somebody who's
willing to do their work in public
somebody who's willing to say all right
here here's what we can show you with
the algorithm here's what we've done
look for yourself you can see in your
search results that that's roughly
what's happening so you can tell that
we're doing what we said we're doing if
we get to any kind of situation like
that with Twitter then you're going to
have to say what you watched was Twitter
being the the only respons ible
corporate entity in terms of Infowars
and the way that was treated the only
one Twitter was the only responsible
entity the only one who who respected
the constitution on that question I'm
not I'm not going to defend everything
Twitter's ever done I'm saying on that
question they're the only ones that
defended the
Constitution indirectly because all they
were doing is defending their own rules
and keeping the Integrity of the
platform which I appreciated so I say
give given that Twitter broke with the
pack and defended free speech and
defended the transparency of the rules
and said here's the rules here's what he
did here's the transparency did not did
not violate the rule transparency says
we got to keep them on the platform and
they did as long as that's the case I
think you got to do a wait and
see so so give Twitter a wait and see
about their transparency be as be as uh
you know critical as you want after you
see what they come up with give them a
little time to work it out but I think
you got to say that the recent evidence
the way they handled Infowars the recent
evidence suggests that they have more of
a commitment to honest debate and uh
Free Speech than the other
platforms so uh
well let's talk about uh Kanye how many
of you saw the um saw the interview with
Kanye West on Jimmy Kimmel I think it's
available all over the internet today if
you haven't seen it you should watch it
just for the entertainment
value
because Kanye West is so freaking
interesting no matter what he does you
know and and I've we've said this before
that um he's he's a different kind of
artist because he's not someone who just
creates art he's someone who lives it
you know his his life everything he does
you know from the shirt he puts on to
the things he says to the projects he
takes on it's it's all art you know he's
the most comprehensive
artist maybe of all time I didn't
realize that he started as a visual
artist in other words a someone who
paints or does graphic design and that
sort of thing
so he's a visual artist a clothing
designer a producer a music music maker
makes Beats um and and then the way he
lives his life you know the way he
interacts with the public um every part
of his life that we can observe is Art
it's it's amazing um but you have to
watch his interview with uh Jimmy Kimmel
because the two of them have a good
chemist Myer and it's just it's just
great to watch so don't miss that if you
have a chance to watch it
um somebody said that I'm on the Kanye
Kool-Aid since he got since I got
retweeted you are
incorrect I got retweeted because I was
on the Kanye uh train so I was on the
train first and then he re retweeted
me
um um I'm looking at
your somebody said is Kanye so
successful because of his mental
illness
um it's not a cause and effect thing
it's more of a correlation thing I think
you know there's lots of evidence that
um
artists have uh Minds that are you know
put together differently than other
people so I think it's a correlation
that if your mind is I think if your
mind is that
open and and you can see the world that
clearly as artists have to I've got a
feeling that that in order to have those
capabilities there's probably some
instability that's just comes along with
the package it's sort of like driving
really fast will get you to your
destination sooner but more risk of
crashing it's probably something closer
to
that there's a request
for a simultaneous zip and I being a man
of the people have decided to do just
that uh all right somebody just reminded
me of my favorite
story I completely forgot about um did
anybody see that well you all saw the
story that um president Trump's star on
the Walk of Fame Walk of Stars whatever
it is the Hollywood Walk of Fame that uh
bad people were uh pickaxing the star
the president's star and they tried to
replace it and I think it got pickaxed
again so uh some artist
came up with these
um what would you call them enamel or no
not enamel this laminated these
laminated stick on stars that look
exactly like the star of Fame and went
on that big long sidewalk that has lots
of blank um blank squares and just stuck
dozens and dozens of these uh fake
Stars they're
vinyl yeah so they're vinyl decal decals
now you have have to see the pictures of
it because even in really clear pictures
they really look like they're actually
stars that built into the concrete the
the reproduction of them is so good that
it's just Sensational and as a as a
political prank it's it's freaking
fantastic so uh it's just
wonderful so and it also sets a
president you know that uh it was that
one it seemed like that one
situation where the Trump supporters
were getting the worst of it you know
it's such a tiny small unimportant thing
the Little Star on the sidewalk but it
seemed like the only
thing that you know was clearly working
in favor of the anti-trumpers and then
somebody comes along with vinyl decals
and completely changes the
equation which was
hilarious um all right I don't have much
else to say today um but I will give you
another shout out to go checkout blight
authority.com which is already getting
lots of comments that's the website um
that is collecting suggestions for what
to do in those areas in the urban
centers that have been cleared by the
blight Authority nonprofit so now you've
got this free basically free uh land in
these inner cities and we're collecting
ideas what to do about them the better
your ideas the more chance something
might
happen um oh let's talk about space
force you saw the uh there were some
suggestions about uh what I guess the
public is being asked to vote on what
the dcal for space force should look
like or the the
logo and
um something tells me that uh I'm going
to put out a prediction here I think the
public will come up with a better
logo
um yeah I think watch for the public to
come up with a better one all right hold
on a
second all right I've got to sign off
now and I will talk to you all later
