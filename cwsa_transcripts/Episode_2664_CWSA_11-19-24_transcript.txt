he little bit
mixed that's not that bad could be worse
let's call up the
comments because we got a show coming oh
my
goodness probably the best thing you've
ever seen
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I
don't think you'll ever have a better
time in your life but if you'd like to
take this experience up to levels that
nobody can even understand with their
tiny shiny human brains all you need for
that is a cuper muger glass of tanker
chel or Stein the canteen jugg or flask
of vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine end of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous zp and it
happens
now oh so
good I mean really sometimes it's so
good I can't even can't even stand
it well you'll be surprised to hear that
there's a new study that identified the
huge positive health effects of coffee
that's right apparently it's really good
for your gut bacteria gives you fiber oh
my goodness it can make you uh coffee
can make you levitate off the
ground um it will make you immortal and
possibly being able to fly long
distances by flapping your
arms okay none of that last stuff is
true but every day there's new
information about coffee and I wouldn't
rule it out it could be a fuel of the
future meanwhile a in the publication
pulse uh somebody wrote an article about
all the mental health benefits of
laughter huh so it turns out that
laughter which is a subset of being
happy is good for your health well they
could have saved some money by asking me
but some of the things they found is
that laughter reduces your Stress and
Anxiety don't you feel better already it
improves your mood and it combats
depression it enhances Your Sleep
Quality it improves your cognitive
function it builds your social
connections now that's a lot of good
stuff yeah so if you find yourself
laughing at any time during this
podcast you'll probably feel yourself
just getting healthier every
moment all right there's a Pennsylvania
School according ARS Technica had to
shut down because one clever student
figured out how to make deep fake um
nudes of the female
classmates and rather than making just
one he made 50
different he made 50 different deep
fakes of his of his female classmates 50
different ones now here's my question
was there really only one kid who knew
how to do it and so he did 50 of them or
is it at a point where they can all do
it because I wouldn't know how to do it
every AI that I know how to use wouldn't
do that if he want if he has it to so
there must be some kind of like secret
you know dark web deep deep fake AI that
if you knew what it was you could use it
now here's the
problem uh sure they can shut down that
one school
sure you could punish that one
person yep probably never do it again
but I was once
14 is is anybody here who was also a
14-year-old boy at any time in your life
have you ever been a 14-year-old
boy if I were a 14-year-old boy and you
handed me a tool that was free and could
turn anybody I wanted into a uh a
porn you couldn't pry that out my
14-year-old hands how in the world are
you going to stop
this I there's this is going to be to
Infinity this is
Unstoppable and kids are going to do
it so I don't know what you're going to
do about that I think I think the weird
horrible future is that every young
woman will have to just get used to
being in a porn that she wasn't in that
her deep fake was in I don't know I I
honestly I think there's literally zero
way to stop
it if there was an AI that could have
done it in the first place and that's
apparently out there and somebody has
access to
it doesn't look
good but anyway a robot dog you've seen
all the robot dogs uh one of them just
finished in South Korea uh finished a
marathon on one charge so with one
battery recharge a robot dog ran a
marathon so
calculating distance I would feel safe
living near a robot dog 10
miles
nope 15 miles too close too CL 26
miles not enough you get to get farther
than 26 miles away from your robot dog
if it's you know got a
weapon I for one do not trust robot dogs
pit bulls are looking good I might get a
pitbull to fight the robot
dogs um you've seen that more athletes
are doing the Trump
dance you know the Trump
dance it's the
danestone can do
it if I see a uh a little viral video on
Tik Tok or something and I I'll see the
young people doing these dances where it
looks like they're floating over the
floor and they're they're Moon walking
like crazy and they're you know they got
all kinds of things going on I look at
that and I say hey I could do
that if I spent the next year of my life
doing nothing but practicing that one
15-second dance but you show me the
Trump dance and I I look at that and I
go hold on people hold hold on there's a
dance I could learn pretty quickly so
let me see if I got
it is that it do I have it
yet I I think I'm close probably another
week or two of practice I could nail
that yeah so US soccer
Legend uh Christian pilic you all know I
mean obviously you're all huge fans of
American soccer so you would know you
would know the name of our best American
soccer players obviously so Christian
pilik very well known in America he did
the Trump dance after scoring so I I saw
a compilation clip a few times of the
various football players and other
athletes doing the Trump dance and even
uh one of the winners at the U
UFC
but do you think it's really
widespread because when you see on the
news and there's five instances of it
you think well this is everywhere but
there might be
five so I'm not I'm not quite ready to
say that it's safe to wear your magga
hat and and if you do the Maga dance in
front of your school on Talent night
you'll be perfectly fine because I don't
think you will I still think that hiding
might be your better
play for now
unless you're a famous athlete and then
you can do what you
want according to geeky gadgets open
AI um and Microsoft they're making this
gigantic new Improvement in in their AI
chat GPT and this is a big one because
they're going to give it near infinite
memory
capacity so if you're trading your AI
you can upload much larger documents but
it will remember it all which it doesn't
do now and if you um have a lot of
interactions with it it will remember
you basically
forever so you can build a little agent
um and this is the for me this is the
first
time it looks like it could be a real
product the AI that we've seen so far or
just for demonstrations and you know
maybe laugh here or there a deep fake
here or there maybe make a deep fake
your classmates but really not much of a
product however if you could build a an
agent that would remember everything it
ever learned and you could just train it
by talking to it and it would remember
everything he said apparently it can
also build its own skills so you could
train it to go out and acquire new
skills and it can sort of grow on its
own
now put it all together and what do you
have that's right we're getting closer
and closer to the scottbot where I take
my Consciousness and my personality and
I move it to a digital Forum to live
forever and no I'm not joking about this
at all I don't know if it'll be the chat
GPT
model but if chat GPT can do it I'm sure
that others can what I don't know if I
can do yet is imitate a person so I
don't think chat GPT yet can do a deep
fake because I need it to do all these
things it can do but also talk like me
and look like me I don't think it can do
that yet so maybe it'd have to be two
AIS working together or something like
that but
close well another news uh apparently
there's a weather event heading my way
let's see what's it called is it rain no
's see a storm no uh it's called a bomb
cyclone
that's right a bomb Cyclone is heading
for me Northern California but I'm I'm
I'm at the I'm at one border of what
it's going to hit now I don't have to
tell you that I'm not too happy about a
bomb Cyclone heading my way sometime
today
but if if I I'll tell you if I walk the
dog I'm not going to let go of the uh
the leash because I've got a feeling my
dog's going to be like a kite I'm just
be walking around dog will be floating
ahead of
me all
right um so today is the day that judge
Maran uh rules something about
Trump I get all the law fares confused
which one is Marshon is he
the he's doing which
trial tell me which one he is I don't
care yeah so the question I was asked is
do you think judge Maran will delay
whatever he's doing or drop the case
whatever he's doing I forget which one
he's on and I've did I think my answer
is he'll do whatever is bad for
Trump that's my answer if if he has any
path that's bad for Trump but also
somewhat realistically within the bounds
of things he should be doing he'll do
that I think that you'll just see
something that's
whatever is the most negative thing he
can do under the circumstances so I
don't know what that would be but look
for it here's what I don't expect oh
okay you're president now this just
needs to go away I don't expect that
maybe maybe or maybe it'll be postponed
until after he's president or something
but I can't imagine they would take the
risk away from him
completely because I think they just
hate him so they would want him to twist
as much as he
can so I looked into a little bit the uh
Trump's pick for Energy
Secretary his name is
Wright and uh I like it according to the
verge did a little right up on him so
apparently the energy
secretary is an entrepreneur who has
made a ton of money and his company does
like 10% of the
fracking uh or 10% of the oil I guess in
the US so he's knows everything about
fracking which is good but here's the
best part he also seems to be way up on
geothermal because his company also
invests in
geothermal and nuclear so he's got
investments in a in a nuclear power
plant that Sam alman's involved with as
well
so uh and and then he also says that
climate change is not a crisis he
doesn't say humans are not warming the
Earth he just says it's not a crisis now
that's kind of
perfect I don't know if I could be
happier honestly because the thing you
worry about in
energy but by the way let me say this
clearly there are some jobs where I
think you absolutely need experience in
the domain this is one of them I think
the Energy Secretary should know
something about fracking something about
geothermal and something about nuclear
and ideally solar too although I think
that's a little easier to
understand so not bad I'd be pretty
happy with somebody who has that much
knowledge I don't think that's as
important in even jobs like
defense uh I I think I think they're a
general or or generic very smart person
who's got the right intentions could do
fine there's lots of examples of
that um I saw on this maybe you saw this
on Joe Rogan show he was talking to uh
special forces veteran FN haer haer or
haer AER haer anyway he's one of the
founders of Black Rifle coffee I think
and he was talking about with his own
experience as a special forces guy he
says if we declare war on the cartel
which is something Trump said you do uh
these dudes are not going to understand
what the f is going on they are in for a
world of ultra violence that they've
never actually felt before they have
they have effing no clue if we organize
these tier one units against them uh
what I would be doing if I were down
there I'd be getting ready to retire
right now because if Delta Force is
hunting me bro I would be so
terrified now is that hyperbole because
it seem to me the cartels uh are quite
quite aware of what violence looks like
but mostly they're doing it out so if
some came to
them uh from something other than a
competing cartel which of course they
have some violence from I don't
know do how many of you think that the
cartel would try to bring the pain to
main to Mainland America to see if they
could get Delta Force or something off
their back
here's what I would suggest if I could
give some advice to the
cartels if we come after you with the
military it's going to be devastating to
you if you attack the United States
citizens let's say do some terrorist
attack because you're trying to take the
pressure off it's going to be way
worse because if you think we're pissed
off
now just to a terrorist attack on
mainland United States and then we're
and then we' take it to the ground we'll
do whatever it takes just
one have you seen the United States we
only need one attack against us and
we'll just go crazy have you heard of
911 we spent a trillion dollars after
911 yeah so if anybody from the cartel
is
listening if the Special Forces come
after you you need to immediately
try to make a deal either leave the
country or try to make a deal but don't
attack American citizens
because that's not going to work out for
you at all not even a little bit will
that work out so I can promise you that
so I don't know if this is going to
happen I do worry that Trump will get
the talk you know where the Special
Forces boss comes in and says you
know we kind of have an arrangement with
the cartel
I think that's what's going to
happen so if I had to predict I would
predict that we will not use special
forces against the
cartels I hate to say it but that's my
prediction
um Thomas Massie and a lot of other
people warning about uh the new
aggression that Ukraine is showing
toward
Russia and Biden has authorized these
long range strikes of these long- range
missiles that we provided to Ukraine and
that authorized the use of them within
Russia itself which Russia says the
Kremlin says that means the United
States or well NATO that means that NATO
is at war with Russia and they will act
accordingly uh oh now you're worried
about nuclear
war and you're worried about this
getting on a hand some have suggested
that the reason that Biden authorized
this so soon um before you know or so
close to the switch over of power that
his real intention is to handcuff Trump
and make sure Trump can't come in and
solve a war on day one that Biden
couldn't
solve so do you believe that do do you
believe that any part of Biden's
intention is to make Trump fail at
making
peace I don't think I don't think so
because I think this works in Trump's
favor the the closer you get to complete
destruction of both countries or all
countries
involved the closer you are to
peace unfortunately that's just the way
it works there's no other if you don't
have the threat of you know you're
definitely going to be dead if you keep
on this path like not any question about
it 100% you're going to be dead that's
when people get flexible if they think
they're not going to be dead they might
act that way but uh yeah we need to be
at the point where serious people are
afraid of nuclear war that's how you get
peace but would you like me to make sure
that there's no nuclear
war is there anybody who would like to
ask me to guarantee
that there's no nuclear war between
Russia and NATO and the
US I'm willing to do it I can do it
right now if you like all
right and all we really need is a
blanket some of you will understand
this some of you will
not those who understand will have to
explain it to those who
don't but here's how we avoid nuclear
war
Russia you know you don't want nuclear
war with the United States it's
literally the last thing you
want Ukraine you know you don't want
nuclear war it's the last thing you want
NATO
us you don't want nuclear war it's the
last thing you want do you know what all
of you do want you want the big dog to
get off the porch you want January 20th
to
come and you want to look as Fierce and
dangerous as you can be so that when you
walk into those negotiations you have
maximum
leverage and
then the big dog's going to make a
piece and you're going to accept
it you're going to complain like crazy
but you're going to accept it so Russia
and NATO your two choices are this
nuclear destruction of all of
civilization or wait a few weeks and
everything will be
fine which of those two choices sounds
better to
you complete nuclear destruction of
civilization before we even get to
Mars or how about we just work it out on
around January 20th 21st something like
that now given that every smart person
in the world believes that a negotiated
peace is now not only possible but
guaranteed and we know that Putin
as tough and mean as he can be some say
evil but I'll tell you what nobody
accuses Vladimir Putin of being
irrational nope not once
he's not an irrational guy do you know
what Trump is not
irrational you you can hate his policies
you can hate anything he says his posts
blah blah he's not
irrational he's very very
transactional and so is
Putin so you've got the two most
transactional leaders the strongest ones
the ones who can get what they want
because they have enough clout in their
own land to do it they both want peace
they want a
lot and of course it's going to happen
so here's what you need to know if
you're
worried we have the lowest chance of
nuclear war with Russia right now
between now and you know January mid
January it's the lowest risk of nuclear
war it'll never be lower than this it's
close to zero and the reason is that
100% of the people involved can see that
simply
waiting is almost guaranteed to work
whereas using a nuke is basically
death we've never seen choices this
clear so could something accidental
happen well I
suppose but in terms of intentional
nuclear war it's the lowest risk in your
lifetime because it would be the only
time that there's no argument for a
nuclear war the next few weeks none a
few missiles go into Russia sorry that's
not even close that's not even close to
a nuclear
war it would be maybe if it were closer
to the beginning of the war or look like
Russia couldn't win you know maybe if
things were different it would be
dangerous but in our current exact
situation you have the lowest risk of
nuclear war you you've ever experienced
in your life nobody wants
it and and and I think that both sides
are
probably one assumes or at least one
hopes
probably both sides are giving a little
extra attention to making sure there's
nothing accidental that happens because
an accidental any kind of accidental
alert um that would make one side
spooked would be the worst thing you
could do so they probably have also the
most attention they've ever given
to making sure there's no accidental
thing I would imagine that they're
testing the the red phone every 5
minutes is that still a thing is there
still like literally a phone you can
pick up in the White House and and
Putin's going to be pretty close to
picking it
up yeah they're going to make sure that
we have a direct line of communication
that there's no delay and if somebody
gets a false signal one way or the other
you want to be able to call and say did
you just send a new car way and we need
to say no or whatever vice versa so
we'll be fine it's actually the last
thing I'd worry about today it's not
even on my list of things to think about
you will be
fine but it but the only reason you'll
be fine is that all the reasonable
people are up in arms right if you just
sort of ignored it that would be the
wrong thing but being super alert to how
big a deal this is is good that's where
you want to be that's where we
are all right um the Gateway Punda says
that uh people in the doj and FBI at
least the officials are hiring their own
criminal defense lawyers ahead of
Trump's return now how often have you
hired a criminal defense lawyer when
nobody has even accuse you of a
crime have you ever done that well
nobody's accused ACC me of a crime and
as far as I know I haven't committed any
but you know I think I'd better get
myself a criminal defense lawyer well
some of them might be genuinely innocent
of all crimes and maybe just worried but
it sure looks guilty doesn't it now
they're all innocent until proven guilty
so that the standard is Innocent
but if it's really true that they're ler
lawyering up I feel that on some level
they
think that there's a real
risk on some level I think a lot of
people know they were part of a
conspiracy and I don't know if they know
if that conspiracy was legal or not
because let's say let's say there was
enough evidence for a
RICO uh Rico
prosecution and it could be in several
domains because the the Democrats and
you know everything from the military to
the
mainstream
press and the intelligence people they
seem to coordinate on a lot of stuff so
at what point does the
coordination if the outcome is something
illegal hypothetically at what point
does the coordination toward that one
outcome that's
illegal become
Rico so you can see a situation where
somebody just took a meeting or took a
phone call and they were sort of in on
the plot but maybe not not super
actively you know they were just sort of
part of the conversation and maybe
didn't do something to stop it are they
part of the RICO can you go to jail for
being part of the conversation because
the the whole Rico is that it's a
coordinated group planned activity if
you're part of the people who are
plotting even if you didn't do the
action but the people who did the action
met with you and got some advice and you
said well I'm not going to stop you are
you guilty I have no
idea so I want to say again as I'll say
this many times because I think the more
I say it the better I'm completely
opposed to any Trump
lawfare if I see even a even the scent
of it I'm going to go nuts because we
didn't go through all this work just to
put a bunch of in charge right
we didn't fight this hard to get rid of
law fair just to do our own law
fair that's that's no go you better have
really really good evidence of a crime
you know the way it should be you should
have really good evidence of a crime and
I wouldn't go looking for it if there's
not anything that's you know somewhat on
the surface so no we I am absolutely not
okay with lawfare as any kind of Revenge
and and believe me I feel like I've been
a victim of coordinated
activities my cancellation I don't think
happened just all in a vacuum yeah I'm
pretty sure that was part of the larger
you know Democrat political strategy to
cancel everybody they
can but even
then I don't I don't want anybody who
didn't break a law to go to jail I want
zero of
that all right so they got their
lawyers uh as Mike stovich says what on
a post on De he said what Democrats did
in Pennsylvania gives Credence to 2020
stolen election
claims future claims will be informed by
what we all just saw stolen election
deniers uh oh we'll call them stolen
election deniers not election deniers as
we shall call them now carry the burden
of proof so what he's talking about is
that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court told
the election board to stop counting
illegal votes an illegal vote would be
one that has let's say um a non-matching
signature or there's something irregular
about it that makes it
uncountable
um but the election
board decided to just ignore the core
order and just keep counting them now
somebody said that it wouldn't be
possible to easily back back out the
ones that are
miscounted because maybe they're not
separately keeping track for the ones
that are illegal in case there's a you
know motion to remove exactly those
illegal ones but nothing else if they
can't tell which ones are illegal and
which ones are legal when they're done
counting what's your recourse then an
audit and then you just still don't have
an answer about who's the senator it
goes on for months um I don't know but
to me I'm I'm going to agree with
cernovich on his take that watching the
Supreme Court tell them to stop counting
illegal votes and then watching the
election board try to do it anyway
certainly suggests that rigging is
normal me meaning that this doesn't look
like something that somebody came up
with that they never thought of before
it just has that feeling like you kind
of did that a little naturally
they just kept counting and they kept
finding all these
votes well I personally have no proof
that uh Pennsylvania is going to end up
doing something illegal but we do know
they're violating the order of the
Supreme Court in
Pennsylvania
so do you go as far as I do and say that
cernovich is right that just watching
this tells you that 2020 was probably
crooked anyway um there are now six
Democrat leaders at least to say they
will not comply with Trump's new
government immigration enforcement so
you've got the Arizona governor Illinois
governor Colorado governor Massachusetts
governor and also the mayors of Chicago
and Boston which are obviously in two of
those States so you've got four
states they have some leaders saying
that they're going to
resist
immigration
um
enforcement and my question is this how
much can they how much can they
interfere before they go to
jail what exactly does it look like when
they
interfere they interfere on what
level now it'd be one thing if they tell
their local police you know don't talk
to the feds
that wouldn't be surprising and maybe
that's
legal maybe that's okay I mean not okay
but maybe it's not technically illegal
but what else would they do suppose they
tried to hide them suppose the
government got involved in hiding
illegal immigrants of the kind that we'
want to
deport don't you go to jail for that
like at what point is this just jailable
offense that you're not going to let the
government do the thing that the
government is tasked with doing
defending the
country I guess we'll find out meanwhile
the the uh stock of alphabet you know
the owner of Google and more uh is down
pre-market anyway because people think
that the Trump doj will push for Google
to sell off its Chrome browser to break
its
Monopoly what do you
think do you think that Google's going
to get broken up by uh Trump
officials I don't
know it are Republicans typically the
the the Monopoly
Busters what's the history of Monopoly
busting has that been more on the left
or more on the right it's been on the
left hasn't
it so but in this case Google looks like
an enemy to um
democracy so that I think the
Republicans might look at this as less
of a monopoly problem and more of a um
disinformation problem meaning that if
Google can control what you see they can
control the election now do you remember
the
uh do you remember was it Dr Epstein I
think who said that Google could change
an election by quite a few points what
would happen if Google had not been
influencing the election and mainstream
media had not been trying to influence
the election and the fake polls had not
been trying to influence the
election how much would it how much
could Trump have won by if you took
those you know those biasing factors out
I don't know maybe
more I'll tell you the thing that is
surprising me the most is that Democrats
are confessing
failure and I'm wondering if that's
because they don't have current
leadership
if they had leadership wouldn't they be
selling a narrative
instead so if there was somebody who
could say hey Democrats I am your leader
uh you should give this messaging and
they'd say something like uh well the
election was actually kind of close if
you look at you know the 70 some million
versus 70 some million is kind of
close and but you're not seeing that so
much you're actually seeing Democrats
saying we got we got our asses kicked we
lost as bad as you can lose we better
look at what we're doing to see if it's
wrong I've never seen this I've never
seen anything like that before now why
do you think it is that they're
accepting I think it's the lack of
leadership isn't it because if they had
a leader the leader would be telling
them to to hang tight stay strong don't
admit any
mistakes um kind of immediately regroup
but there's nothing like that happening
that they are just floundering and
flapping around and and every day that I
think that I will be done enjoying how
much they don't understand why they lost
I'm surprised because once again another
full day of being entertained by
democrats who try to explain to
themselves and to others why they didn't
win and they're not even close they they
they just don't seem to understand
really anything it's like they have been
around for the last eight years or
something like they just landed on the
planet it's kind of weird now the reason
of course is that their information Silo
was completely fake and has been fake
for probably a decade at least if not
forever so they had no idea what reality
looked like imagine can you imagine the
size of the mind if you thought
that the Trump supporters were a
minority of the country and like a a
really serious minority and then you
found out that they literally
outnumbered you and that all the the
Hitler blaming and the the fascist stuff
and the deplorable stuff didn't make any
difference like imagine waking up to
that and your your whole reality is
upside down now because you don't know
if you're one of the bad
guys and I have some bad news for you
Democrats I don't mean this as just like
a like a throwaway comment
insult you have been the bad
guys I don't think it's all
intentionally like uh on
purpose I believe that the the uh media
information landscape was so distorted
by a few bad actors that you honestly
thought the world was a different place
than what it is and then you acted
accordingly now I think that Democrats
in in the information bubble that they
were in were acting for the the greatest
good that's what it looks like to me it
looks like their intentions were
entirely based on the greater good and
if you listen to them talk that's the
way they talked you know this is good
for this group it's good for that group
now of course it wasn't for the greater
good it was destroying America but they
didn't
know they they thought things were going
swimmingly because the news that they
watched said this Joe Biden thing's got
everything under control his brain is
working perfectly and if anything ever
went wrong God we're lucky we've got KLA
Harris the highly qualified vice
president to take over immediately If
Ever Needed none of that was ever true
not I don't think
anything probably almost
nothing that was an official claim of
the news or the media was true almost
nothing
now there's fake news on both sides
obviously it's not limited to one side
but the extent of
it uh I think was unparalleled I think
the Democrats broke some new kind of
record for fooling
themselves um what else we got
here so now axios and you're seeing a
little grumbling from Democrats saying
that uh if if there are millions of
deported undocumented immigrants
if Trump goes ahead with it it will
create gigantic negative effects in the
economy meaning that the people who need
to pick the crops and do the work
they're not going to have enough workers
and it will be a 6.8% drop in the
national
GDP all right do you believe that here's
what I
think
um I I never have any resp respect for
the critics Who start with okay assume
you do everything the stupid
way and then then I want to say wait
wait wait wait stop talking no no we
need to we need to discuss what's going
to happen Okay but your assumption was
that I was going to do a thing that
could easily be done the smart way but
you're saying let's start with the
assumption that you do it the stupidest
possible way yeah yeah yeah let's do
that so let's talk about tariffs and
we're going to put 100% tariffs on
everything wait wait wait wait wait no
tariffs are a negotiating tool so I'm
not going to accept your assumption that
we' use them in the stupid as possible
way which is put it on everything
without thinking about it we might do a
strategically we might try to protect an
industry we might say we're going to do
comprehensive tariffs just as a
negotiating tool but don't assume that
we're going to do a smart thing that
could easily be done the smart way and
people have done it the Smart Way
forever the Trump will be the only one
who will do it the dumb way so here's
how you do immigration the dumb way the
dumb way would be on day
one uh go get all the Farm
Workers I mean
seriously do you think that the U border
the border patrol and ice and the th
those people do you think they have
enough resources to start with the Farm
Workers
and that they would and that that would
make any sense at all to anybody like
who would agree with that there isn't a
person in the world who would do that
now could you imagine that Trump starts
with the criminals and maybe people who
came in in the last few months yes
easily of course I can imagine that so
why would you make the assumption that
he would do the dumbest thing you could
possibly do which is get rid of the
undocumented migrants who are already
adding to the
GDP now over
time you could imagine that the
undocumented migrants picking crops that
honestly we're not going to get
Americans to do that uh you could
imagine that they slowly get replaced
with documented people or their own
status gets you know upgraded so that
hey you're you're a good seasonal worker
there's no reason not to let you in
because you show that as soon as the
crops are picked you go back home you
share your money we have no problem with
that so you could imagine that the
undocumented Farm Workers which are
necessary would over time get
transformed into a legal group of people
that may or may not come from other
countries but we're not gon to we're not
going to starve the country by rounding
up rounding up the crop
Pickers don't assume that we just start
stupid and stay that way I'm not going
to have that conversation but that's the
one that's what the
uh uh the Democrats are trying to make
you think past the sale the sale is that
Trump is going to do the dumbest
possible
deportation no I do not accept that he
would do the dumbest possible
deportation I will only accept that he
would get rid of the criminals and maybe
the most recent arrivals first and if we
could ever get to the end of that pile
which I don't think we can well then
maybe you look at some other stuff but
but we would do it
smartly
um yeah
anyway according to uh one report the US
government loses between
uh 200 billion and 500 billion to fraud
every
year to
fraud up to half a trillion
dollars to
fraud every year
are you kidding me to fraud every year
what kind of fraud are we talking about
anyway um Elon Musk made a comment that
maybe Doge can do something about fixing
that there has to be some kind
of
transparency change that can happen now
I've been saying forever that the United
States is doomed unless we fix this one
part of our system you cannot have
locals City officials deciding who gets
what
contracts as soon as you do that they
all turn into criminals because it's
just too easy to give it to your friend
and take a bribe so I think the law
needs to be changed somehow that there
needs to be some either transparency or
oversight or something but otherwise all
local cities just attract
criminals it's kind of like I say about
um shoe
salesman if if you see somebody who's a
shoe salesman who's been working in the
lady shoe sales
department probably has a for
fetish just saying follow the money
Follow The
Fetish well do you remember Dr uh
Deborah
Burks from the pandemic days of course
you do she was a sort of a right-hand
person to fouchy and she says she backs
RFK Jr for Health and Human
Services how about that and she hopes
for
transparency well here's my take I don't
need and nobody needs your nomination
your uh your backing Dr Burks Dr Burks
is a backer of the drinking bleach hoax
she was on the stage and listened to
Trump very specifically talk about light
as the disinfectant and can the light be
brought into the body to be infectant
which was being trialed at that time was
literally being tested or being set up
to test at that time and uh she allowed
the media to say that he said how about
drinking bleach and she never
corrected that
 I I she's one of the people I just
hate with a passion I just hate
this lady because this was a big big
 up not just what you did maybe for
Co that can be somebody else's problem
to do that but she stood there and
watched one of the biggest hoaxes in
America being formed around her and
never still has never figured out that
trump bookended it with light he
mentioned light then he talked about the
light and then he made sure that you
knew he was talking about the light at
the end while the other ones were
talking about something
else I I can't forgive that
Burks you need to do something about the
drinking bleach ox and it's not good
enough if you say he didn't use the word
bleach because if you turn it into well
he didn't mean bleach he meant some kind
of liquid household disinfectant no he
didn't nobody would say that he didn't
say that he was very specific about what
he was talking about
light which by the way was tested on
inserting it down the trachea and uh
didn't work out so the trial was not a
success but it was a perfectly smart
question to ask can you do this inside a
body so Trump had the smart question the
experts were wrong and the experts went
away and told you that that the smartest
guy there the one who knew about light
being tested inside bodies was really
suggesting drinking
bleach God I'm so mad at
that Dr Burks you need to fix that and
then you can get back on the right
side while we're getting more trickles
of information about Matt Gates and the
ethics charges against them so here's
what's coming out this doesn't mean it's
true so these are
allegations and uh Gates being a
American citizen is what innocent until
proven guilty so I'm going to treat him
as innocent
um and I want him to be the Attorney
General um if all of these things are
true I don't really
care let me be as clear about that as I
possibly can if every allegation that I
tell you is true I don't care doesn't
make any difference to me at
all and you can't make me care you can't
guilt me into it right now he may have
some legal
complications and it may affect his
nomination unless it gets unless it's a
recess appointment I guess
but you can't make me care all right so
here's the
story um two women have testified in
front of the house Ethics Committee that
Gates paid them for sex and that's
according to the attorney who represents
them um they were in that very young
range but they they were above 18 there
is however one seeming there was one
reported exception so there's one uh
young woman who was
18 who said that she observed at some
party she turned a corner and allegedly
saw Matt Gates having sex with her
friend who she had known for a long time
so she would know the friend's age so
the 18-year-old had a 17-year-old
friend most of the people there probably
were legal
age but apparently there was one that
wasn't and the reporting is that uh
there's no reporting that gase would
have known the woman's age so so nobody
says he knew how old she was I believe I
believe that nobody's making that
claim so the possibility that he just
assumed she was legal age or you know
maybe should have asked and didn't but
we don't have we don't have testimony
that he knew we do have testimony that
when he was told he immediately
discontinued meaning not just that night
but somebody had been seeing more than
once so we know that as soon as he knew
there was an age an age issue he stopped
when she turned 18 reportedly it Recon
continuu so that would show that he was
sensitive to the age and when it was
clear that he knew it
he
discontinued now is that an excuse if it
sounds like I'm excusing any of his
behavior that's not what's happening I'm
just describing it just a description
I'm not making a judgment call I'm just
describing
it and um apparently there's some uh
venmo and maybe PayPal records that show
that payments were given to some young
women and that they say that those
payments were for
sex
so let me let me add some uh reality to
the world how many people who have as
much money as gates gates comes from I
think a wealthy family so he's got some
resources how many how many rich people
do you think have paid for
sex except in sort of a girlfriendy
situation not a not an actual
necessarily a prostitute but somebody
that they said you know if if somebody
like Dan Bilzerian you know he's a
famous um social media guy has lots of
girlfriends if he were to pay one of his
girlfriends to come and stay for the
weekend and I'm not saying he does but
let's just say he did would she assume
he was paying for
sex or would she assume that he was
paying for a company and sex was assumed
but it wasn't what he was paying
for because there's a little bit of a
mind reading element to
it because he may be paying because they
don't have money to travel so let's say
you're a rich guy with a
yacht and you know that if you offer
somebody a few thousand dollars they
will have the money to travel to you
they'll be able to take some time off
from their job because you paid them and
you're both kind of thinking probably
there's going to be some sex but then
let's say that the young lady says no
I'm not interested and then the rich guy
in the Y says oh oh well I really
thought we were on the same page on this
but okay I mean I'm not a rapist so of
course if you don't want you you don't
want to and then maybe they don't get
together again but here's the surprise
maybe they do
maybe she says no to sex and maybe he
says you know what I really enjoyed
hanging out with you so I'm going to pay
you again same amount just as if there
had been sex but this time we'll just
hang out and if you ever change your
mind then maybe something mutually
exclusive you know mutually beneficial
will happen but you know you don't have
to here's some money the the the thing
that's hard to understand at the
non-rich person level
is the degree to which rich
people rich men transfer money to women
that's just part of the travel and is
more about the
situation and whether or not their sex
is actually a separate
conversation now you might say to me
Scott Scott Scott they both know it's
for
sex yes and no they both know that
that's an intention
but it doesn't mean that if the young
lady said no that Matt Gates was going
to force it or that he wouldn't pay what
he said he was going to pay so in my
opinion these are always consensual and
it's not always about the money even if
money was paid with sort of an overlying
umbrella assumption that you know we're
both kind of thinking in this direction
because it's a separate
decision the decision of whether you
would accept money to be in the company
of this person for a weekend is one
decision and then the once you're there
you're still a human being who can make
a separate decision about what you want
to do with your body right Matt Gates
does not control anybody's body if they
say
no it's just no that's it so is that a
case of paying for
sex how how would you how do you rate
that if if you know the money has that
sort of intention behind it but it's not
a
decision there's an
intention which is not illegal I don't
think I don't think it's wrong to have
an intention but the decision can still
be completely separate because I'm sure
that they weren't punished or sent home
immediately if they said you know what
I'm not feeling good tonight or this
doesn't work for
me now um every now and then I have to
stop and say I'm not excusing anything
he
did I'm also not condemning it unless
you know there was an underage part that
has to be dealt
with but you need to understand it in in
the in the world of the you know the the
yacht Jet Center people things are not
like I bought a prostitute to have a sex
and she left in an hour it's more like
can you spend a week with me in the
Bahamas
and you're both just sort of thinking in
the same direction I don't know so I
guess I don't know even if the young
ladies testified that the money was for
sex was
it because that could be an
intention but not necessarily a
decision you can separate
them I don't know legally it looks like
it's pretty uh pretty perilous so I'm
not going to try to defend them I'm just
going to say that these are these are
never as clean as you think like these
situations they always have all this
gray area so who
knows but if it's true that he didn't
know the age of the young one and if
it's true that um he just had a racy
situation and money was part of it I
don't care I really don't care at all do
you because even the 17-year-old I hate
to say this cuz I'll get in trouble for
the
but I don't believe she complained
because remember their relationship
continued after she was 18 so I think
she had no
complaints so if there's no victim in
the classic sense except that somebody
was technically under
18 um how much should I
care can can I agree that some of this
looks illegal and still not
care I think I
can because if you looked at the number
of
17-year-old young women who had um a
sexual relationship with somebody over
18 it's going to be a really large slice
of America and we're not chasing all of
them to ground and the reason is that we
all have the same impression which is I
wish you hadn't done that but let's not
talk about it I mean that's how people
feel about
17 most
people anyway
um celebrity endorsements don't
work uh just the news is talking about
this so that high-profile celebrities
like Oprah and Beyonce and all that uh
doesn't seem to have changed the vote
according to I think the Center Square
did some kind of um survey they found
that 12% said celebrity endorsements
made them less likely to vote for a
candidate and 9% s said more likely now
I think people are mostly lying in a
poll like this I think the people say no
those celebrities did not affect me
because they don't want to look like an
idiot who wasn't affected who whose vote
was determined by
Beyonce so even if your your vote was
entirely determined by Beyonce if
somebody asked you hey are you an
idiot well I'm going to say
no because if you admitted that your
vote had been changed by you know the
boss or
Oprah you don't really sound like the
smart one in the room so I wouldn't
trust any answers that people gave to
did those celebrity endorsements
influenced me but clearly it did not win
the
day so I suspect uh I'm on the page with
the Democrats have no
idea what Americans are thinking
thinking or feeling I mean sensationally
so if they thought this that that in
2024
celebrities are what people were looking
for for their political
fixes where did they get that like who
in the world thought that now I do think
it's good for for both sides to have you
know their share of celebrity
endorsements so Trump had some too but
um I I think what I think the way you
should look at it is if they couldn't
get any that might mean something but if
you can get 10 it's not going to be that
much different than if you had 20 or 100
right it would be something if you
couldn't get
any but if you can get some that's
fine they both got
some um apparently that Venezuelan gang
trenda
araga according to author ities have
already set up or operations in 16
States according to Homeland
Security um they have to go
first that has to be
really I would be happy if 100% of our
border enforcement was concentrated on
this like all of it and and I don't know
how long it's going to take but I
wouldn't concentrate on anything else
not anything until you got all of these
and that's going to take a
while according to autism Capital which
is an account on X
um the difference in ideology between
men and women is just huge now the
political difference and it's in uh it's
in a number of countries so it's not
just an American phenomenon it's the
same in Germany and some other countries
so it used to be that male and female
opinion sort of track together
and now it just
went and just went in opposite
directions now I saw um a few different
hypotheses on why this was Melissa Chen
said on X that uh it's because of
feminism and birth control
pills now do birth control pills make
you decide and act differently I believe
so so that might be some of it I don't
know um feminism does feminism make
women do dumb
things well it's a mixed bag some
feminism is good some
bad then nval ravikant had a separate
idea he said the state can substitute
for what women want from men but it
can't substitute for what men want from
women and that captures some of it does
it capture all of it I don't know so
could be that these are you know both in
it that that there's something to both
of those theories I'm going to add my
own um what we see as this is the
hypnotist frame so the difference
between male and female uh in
politics is
fear fear because I've told you that the
um the biggest persuasive variable is
fear um you think that hunger is your
biggest driver well not if a lion is
running at you you got to get away from
the lion even if you're really hungry
right so fear beats everything if you
can make somebody scared to death you
can get them to do just about anything
to get away from the
fear so now imagine you've got uh the
Democrat
Party telling everybody that uh Hitler's
coming and that you've got no bodily
autonomy they're going to steal your
democracy what do men hear when they
hear that he's Hitler he's a fascist
he's going to steal your bodily autonomy
what do men say ah probably
not some might say
yes but it wouldn't feel like a direct
risk to them so
much um but women would say oh my God
you know I'm going to lose birth control
that's not going to happen I'm going to
lose my bodily autonomy that's not going
to happen but you could be afraid of it
um and they may be a little
less here here's a generalization I
think this is a fair generalization
they're probably more men who who pay
attention to military
stuff and can uh maybe interpret what's
happening a little bit better because we
just pay attention to it it's sort of a
male thing so in the same way that I
told you that the safest you've ever
been from nuclear war is right
now that that's a male perspective
because I really look at these things
all the time and it doesn't make me a
genius but I pay attention whoever pays
attention the most to any domain is
going to have a little Advantage I pay
attention to the military domain so when
I say that this is the safest you've
ever been I believe a lot of men
probably say something like oh I get
it well let me check how many men heard
me say that this is literally the safest
we could ever be because you just have
to wait a few weeks and it goes away and
everybody knows that how many of you
said oh that's a good
point
and did anybody agree with that by the
way it'd be good if some of you agreed
with it but if you did not follow
politics and you did not
follow military
stuff and the only thing you heard was
that there was a talking had on MSNBC
who says that something happened that
moved us closer to nuclear war because
I'm seeing social media people saying
it's now
11:59 you know the last minute of human
race because of this if that's all you
heard it you'd be scared to
death if somebody just told you yeah we
we're attacking Russia and they
threatened with nuclear war and that's
all you knew how afraid would you be
quite afraid so my hypothesis is that
men are harder to
scare we're just harder to scare but on
top of that we also don't get abortions
and we're not the ones having the babies
so there's just some things we're not
worried about so I think that it makes
sense that since what we think is true
about politics is usually a bunch of
Lies when men hear the lies there
supposed to scare them it doesn't scare
them as much so they can stay on course
when women here we're going to take your
bodily autonomy and there's going to be
a nuclear war if they're not really
paying paying attention to the News
That's the scariest you've ever
heard in your life I mean that's some
really really scary so they're
going to vote against it it makes
perfect sense so I I will add to uh the
nval take which I think is valid that
women are looking to the state for
things that men used to provide you know
the husband used to provide that's valid
and I think that feminism and birth
control certainly are changing the way
thoughts are being formed so that's in
the mix somewhere but I just think
generally speaking men are less easy to
to scare I think that's the big
difference all right
um I hate to even bring this up but I
guess I have to so according to the
Vigilant Fox there's a bombshell autopsy
study now before I tell you what it says
let me give you my opinion that there's
no data that comes down about the
pandemic or the covid that's
credible some of it will be true some of
it will not but I won't know which is
credible and which isn't or which is
true and which is so therefore it's not
credible credible is different from true
so I'm going to tell you what the story
is but I'm also going to tell you
personally might be
true might not be so I'm I'm not a sold
but I could be I could be later sold but
I'm not sold yet but the report is that
aut autopsies show that covid vaccines
are the larger cause of death than even
the the virus itself
it's so it's a study that's been twice
peer-reviewed so that means a lot right
it's a study that was twice
peer-reviewed okay let me explain
peerreview does give you gives you no
confidence
whatsoever it does mean it's not so
obviously stupid that it shouldn't be in
the
conversation it doesn't mean it's real
peer review just looks as surfacy kind
of things so if on the surface the there
was nothing amazingly bad about it they
say well it's peer-reviewed you'd have
to duplicate it and make sure you knew
your data was good before you could have
confidence but here is the
claim 74% of the deaths were were linked
to the vaccination instead of the
covid do I believe that no no I
don't is it possible that is true yes
yes it is is so this is The credibility
thing I just don't believe any of the
pandemic data or conclusions any of it
it's just it's just so so filled with
misinformation I wouldn't know what's
real and what's not and peer review
doesn't help me at all I'm sorry peer
review gives me no confidence at
all um of the covid vaccine related
deaths sudden Cardiac Arrest died
suddenly was the leading cause of deaths
35% of cases do I believe that no Noe
but it's also possible I just don't
believe it on the
surface covid vaccine related deaths
occurred rapidly uh averaging within two
weeks basically and the majority
happened within a week
now that I
believe that that sounds well I would
say that's within the realm of possible
because my understanding is when the
vaccination first came out the expert
said um if you're looking for how
dangerous it is look for what happens in
the first few weeks because uh
overwhelmingly it's predictable that if
it's going to kill people it's going to
be kind of fast you know you don't look
at you know there might still be longer
term problems but most of the risk is
that first two week
period so um that's why although I did
get the first to uh vaccinations that's
why I waited so I waited six months I
think six months after I was eligible
and the reason I waited was first two
weeks I want to see who dies I'm not
going to be first in line month goes by
I'm not sure I trust the data two months
three months six months and it wasn't
until I just really wanted to travel
internationally that I decided it was
time to take the risk but
it makes sense that if there were
injuries they would happen in the first
two weeks more often than after all
right but there's other
research um again I have no idea how how
believable this is but uh there's some
study by let's see independent
investigator John B
senior highlighting findings by Kevin
mccurnin a researcher from blah blah
blah and they say the vaccines are
causing turbo cancer
basically and the Turbo cancers uh would
grow more aggressively than typical ones
and they would affect your lymph
nodes and bone cancer specifically
mentioned lymph nodes and bone
cancer what do you think of that
one
well
um it it doesn't seem to come with
data so I think I'd have to see the data
because cancer is
the number one or number two
killer
so um and I think I think I saw number
that half of all people get cancer have
you ever heard that that half of adults
will get cancer now a lot of it is
treatable so they're not necessarily
dying from it but half of them would get
cancer so if half of people normally get
cancer I don't know how well we could
sort
out you know what's caused by
what so but again do I think this is
credible no do I think it's false no
idea but I don't believe anything that
comes out of the pandemic or anything
about the
vaccination um am I concerned that it
could be true
yes I
am I I may have more to tell you about
that uh in the coming months but yeah
I'm worried about
it all right ladies and gentlemen those
are my prepared
remarks and hope I didn't miss anything
but uh don't worry about nuclear
war I got this I took care of it for
you
um I do worry about how we handle our
all of our health care decisions in the
future oh by the way uh if you want to
hear the greatest irony at the same time
that the vaccinations are being uh
alleged and again I don't I don't
believe the allegations I don't discount
them but I don't have any way to know um
at the same time that the vaccinations
are being blamed for causing turbo
cancer what would be the most ironic
matching news what what news would go
with that that would be so 2024 like the
simulation here it is there there are
increasing anecdotal these are still
anecdotal stories of people who have um
completely tamed their turbo cancer with
iacon is that just perfect or what now
do I do I know that icon works against
cancer no I do not know that so I'm not
making that claim I'm not your doctor
don't take my word for anything it is
true that there is there are an
increasing number of anecdotal claims of
somebody who was in stage four stage
five had tried all the regular things
none of them worked when on itin or
there's another one like it um has some
other name that's similar to I
and uh and there are anecdotal cases of
people who are still around who
shouldn't be
around so wouldn't that be the weirdest
most perfect
simulation that the ion of all the
things in the
world of all the things how could it be
possible that that might be the solution
to the extra or even any cancers that
would be
weird but since you live in a
uh you live in some kind of a weird
simulation
obviously maybe you know one of the
things that makes me think I live in a
simulation is that I see people who
appear to be um living a purchased
experience be if you look at Trump's
life doesn't he look like the life that
somebody signed up and they paid a lot
of money to experience what it would be
like to be Trump
for 80 years or however long he
lives and and Elon
Musk doesn't Elon musk's life look like
literally an adventure he signed up for
all right here's your adventure you're
going to be the uh richest man on earth
you're going to build electric cars
batteries uh you're going to be helping
the president uh yeah you'll be hanging
out with the president pretty much every
day um he'll be listening to you of
course uh you'll be building a rocky
ship to Mars to make us interplanetary
now how in the world does that happen
naturally it sounds
exactly like a a pre-written path that
somebody signed up for and now he's just
enjoying the the path he went on take me
for
example um I have not had you know a
problem free life but what are the odds
that as six years old I knew I would be
a famous
cartoonist how did I know that how did I
also know that I would spend lots of
time talking to large audiences but not
about cartooning necessarily and then
here we are how did I know that was
going to happen when I was a child did I
make it happen because it was in my head
you know how how did Tiger Woods know he
was going to be a golfer at like
two it feels like he signed up for that
adventure and you know when I became a
famous
cartoonist it didn't seem real it just
seemed like some Adventure I'd signed up
for and suddenly everything just came to
me in ways that I couldn't have
predicted so if most of the world are
NPCs but some of us are game players
then um I may have at least one more
Mission because I was thinking if I had
signed up for this
life and um and I it was sort of mapped
out said all right at this age you're
going to do this at this age you're
going to solve this problem for some
people at this age you'll help people
lose weight or something weird things
that I would never have predicted would
be in my resume and then uh when you get
to a certain age what I the adventure
just
ends I feel like I've got at least one
good Adventure left in
me and it's just sort of like tapping me
on the shoulder now I know what it is
but you don't know
yet
but man am I getting tapped on the
shoulder hard so we'll find
out I I feel like I'm going to find out
for sure if this is a simulation
because I'm I'm I'm on a path to trying
something that if it works is going to
blow your mind if it doesn't
work well maybe I wasn't in a simulation
after all but we'll see more on that
later ladies and gentlemen I'm going to
go talk to the people on locals
privately because they're so awesome the
rest of you I will see tomorrow those of
you on X and Rumble and YouTube thanks
for joining
you and locals I'm coming at you in 30
seconds
