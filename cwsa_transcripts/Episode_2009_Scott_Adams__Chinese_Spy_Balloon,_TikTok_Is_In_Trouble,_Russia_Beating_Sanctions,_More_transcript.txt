wow
good morning and welcome to the
highlight of civilization
yes we'll be talking about a big old
balloon
not much else to talk about today turns
out
but uh we got lots to talk about well
we'll talk about that but before we do
would you like to prepare would you like
to be primed to make this the best
experience you've had so far today maybe
your whole life yes all you need is a
cup of mug or a glass of tanker jealous
of Stein I came to your Joker flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the end of
the day the thing that makes everything
better
it's called simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
have you ever stopped to think
that the Universe has been here for I
don't know 13 14 billion years
and you were lucky enough to be alive at
the exact time that the simultaneous sip
was invented I mean really what are the
odds of that
I would say that is
more evidence that things are going
right for you
so what about that spy balloon
well let's begin with the question
what is Lost full of gas and owned by
China
what is Lost full of gas and owned by
China
I will accept Chinese by balloon
Joe Biden or Eric swalwell
any of those answers will be sufficient
all right so the big question is
if there's a big Chinese spy balloon
over the United States why don't we
shoot it down
now what would be the correct political
thing to say let's say you're a
Republican
what is the Smart political thing to say
doesn't mean it's right
strategically but what would be the
right political thing
shoot it down shoot it down and Trump
picked up the free money
so everybody who picked up the free
money
that's somebody you should you know give
a little credit to
is free money
we don't know the details of why it's
not being shot down and we probably
won't you know there's probably some
military reason or even if there's not a
military reason we'll never hear the
real reason if there is one and
so the the smartest thing you could do
is just say shoot it down because you
look tough right
now the the critics are saying uh
Chinese testing our defenses
why don't we shoot it down
do those two things make sense
they're testing our defensives
so why don't we activate our defenses so
they can see how they work and then
shoot it down
I'm not sure we should
let me ask you this what does this mean
apparently our military said that as
soon as we saw this thing coming they
immediately acted to protect against the
collection of sensitive intelligence
how'd they do that
well or you know they make you sound
like
there was some kind of like the roof was
open at their their nuclear facilities
and If you flew a balloon over and you
look carefully you could look right down
into the classified documents
but maybe maybe they closed the roof
like what does it mean how exact really
jam it now of course jamming it is the
first thing I thought of
but wouldn't you need something to be
flying around it all the time
how do you how do you jam it
or do you just make sure that you don't
send any classified information until
it's gone
I would say this whole question of how
they took steps and how effective those
steps were
is sort of a big question
now it's unlikely that they knocked it
down
what would you do if you were the United
States how would you handle it because
I'll tell you how I would handle it
and I haven't seen anybody suggest it
yet
I would tell China to bring it down
or we will but I wouldn't bring it down
before I gave them an option of bringing
you down
um without violence
wouldn't you I just say hey we're going
to bring this thing down
one way or the other so it's coming down
but I think I'd try to force it down
I think I try to negotiate with him to
see if he could get a you know capture
the thing no I don't think you can I
mean I I doubt they would want it to be
captured but
I would at least try to capture it
do you think it has a self-destruct
I I feel like that's
I mean it would be an obvious thing you
would think of but even though it's
obvious I I kind of suspect it doesn't
have that
you know maybe it does I don't know
maybe it's good enough if it crashes you
know
so we got big questions all right so one
possibility that we're not shooting it
down I'll give you all the possibilities
I can think of
um
one is that we routinely do the same
thing
what do you think of that one
we we routinely put balloons and other
surveillance over China
and so we don't really care that much
maybe maybe it's just protecting our own
assets that spy on them
here's another possibility
I'll bet you didn't see this one coming
we're better off if they can see
everything
have you heard of the open Skies treaty
which wasn't a big success I don't think
but this was with Russia and the idea
was we would be able to fly over Russia
and Russia would be able to fly over us
so that we could see if anybody's
cheating with nukes
but you can't really see Too Much from
the air
but do you think we're worse off or
better off
if we can see everything China's doing
militarily from the air which we
probably can and they can see what we're
doing
it's entirely possible that we
calculated this seeing seeing each
other's stuff from the air makes you
safer instead of less safe
that's one possibility I'm not saying
that that's likely I'm just going to run
through the possibilities
all right one possibility is
incompetence right one is incompetence
they just couldn't get it together maybe
it'll happen later but they couldn't get
it together that would just be
incompetence I don't think that's the
answer
one would be that uh Biden is owned by
China
Maybe
but the reporting we're getting is
abiding immediately ordered a shot down
had the military argued against it
now can we believe that report
can you believe in unsourced report that
Biden wanted to shoot that down
but the military talked about it that
sounds exactly like a lie doesn't it
it could be true it could be true
but it sounds exactly like a lie
if you were going to lie that's how you
do it
so what are the possibilities so one
possibility is we didn't want to act we
did not want to activate our defenses so
that we don't give anything away another
possibility is that we're learning
something
from it
do we have the capability to
electronically query it and find out
just what it's doing and how it's doing
it
are we learning about what technology
they have
and and we need to yeah we just need a
little more time to get a better beat on
it are we flying things close to it to
take pictures and to get signal
intelligence from closer up
are we trying to take it over with
hackers
how about that one
how about we deactivated the signal from
China
and we already control it
is that impossible
is it impossible that the United States
already took control of it
I mean we wouldn't tell them would we we
wouldn't mention it it's entirely
possible that we're navigating it toward
a military base
and we're just you know taking it over
Florida or wherever it's going to go
we're taking over some military base and
then we're going to bring it down
now for those of you who are too dumb to
be in this conversation
everything I say is speculation
so if you pick one of them out and say
you freaking that one that you
mentioned isn't the one
I know that too I'm mentioning a bunch
of possibilities and I don't really have
a a favorite among the group now the
military is saying they don't want to
shoot it down because of your debris
field it might you know injure stuff in
the ground does anybody believe that one
that one just feels like a lie right
yeah
there are some types of Lies
that are so obviously a lie that I'm
okay with them
have you ever experienced that a lie so
obvious that you're just okay with it
oh I get it you're lying to me because
you don't want to tell me the answer to
that question I get it I'm good with
that
so when the military lies to you and the
military lies to you in a way that's
just obviously a lie
you have two possibilities one is
something terrible
and the other is they're doing their job
they're just keeping you out of the loop
because that's not going to help
anything
maybe I don't know
so we're in a situation where under
normal historical circumstances
let's say this we're in the 60s
if this happened in the 60s
I believe we all would have said oh
there's a pretty good reason the
government's not shooting that down
would we because we would be so
brainwashed into thinking they had it
under control that we'd all say well
there's nothing to talk about here if
they're not shooting it down it means
there's no there's no security risk or
they've got a big plan
but after going through the pandemic
what's your first assumption about the
government
it's something sketchy right
do you all feel more comfortable if I
acknowledge
that we're in an era in which believing
the government story would be ridiculous
would you agree it would actually be
ridiculous
to believe their story ridiculous we
just don't live in a world where that
kind of a story could be believable or
credible it could be true I'm not saying
it's true or untrue that part's
unknowable but absolutely you can't
trust them absolutely you cannot
they're guilty until proven innocent
all right
do you think that the Chinese did this
to humiliate the United States
prior to what would have been a high
level visit by blinken who has canceled
his trip
do you think it was intentionally a
humiliation play
the only reason I'm going to say no
is that it's two on the nose
it's like a little too on the nose which
doesn't mean it's false right the the
two on the nose rule is not like a you
know law of physics or anything
but it's it's Fairly reliable to me it
just feels a little I don't know too on
the nose too on the story
but maybe
Maybe
the other thing we don't know is how
often they've done it
and it could be that it could be here's
one reason our military would be lying
to us
imagine if we find out
that China's been sending balloons over
us for decades and we've never responded
that would make us look pretty weak
wouldn't it
so that would be one reason that the the
government would say oh we're not going
to tell you what's going on here maybe
it's been happening for a long time and
they don't want to admit it Maybe
now here's the other possibility
we can't shoot it down
what do you think of that
I have I have a
sneaking suspicion
we might not have the technology to take
it out
because the only thing we have that goes
that high is a missile
do we really want to launch a serious
missile
within the continental United States
because I'd be worried as much about the
missile falling on somebody as
the debris from the
balloon
all right so I'm seeing somebody say
trust me we can shoot this down here's
here's what I do trust
I do trust that we have weapons that are
designed to reach it
will you all you'll all take that as a
given
that we do have weapons that are
designed
to reach it would you accept that
that doesn't mean they work
there's sort of a difference between
designed to do it and and confidence of
the work because one possibility is
I don't think our airplanes go that high
I think the only ones that go that high
are the
uh spy planes and I don't I think the U2
goes to 70 000 the balloons is 60 000.
uh are you saying that our regular
fighter jets could go to sixty thousand
because I I only read just recently that
they couldn't I mean like this morning
oh classified Maybe
yeah the new generation can
oh they can plenty can go that high okay
lots of people are telling me that our
current Jets can go that high
interesting
service ceiling is 65 000.
all right all right well I stand
corrected apparently we have Tech so it
sounds like if that's true if it's true
that our fighter jets can get to that
range
then it would be true we could easily
shoot it down right
but what happens with the missiles that
Miss
this is a dumb question if a if a
fighter jet shoots a missile in
continental United States oh they would
use guns
yeah
I guess they would use guns huh
bullets and then let it float down
yeah if you miss where do those guns go
or where do the bullets go
you know it does seem to me that they
could find an empty enough place to take
it down we'll find out soon
all right here's the uh biggest story
that's not exactly being reported so I
noted that uh Bill Maher
uh made a joke
conflating the Spy balloon with Tick
Tock and the joke was you know they
don't need this Bible even because they
already have tick tock yeah
then you also saw a number of tweets
from I think mostly Republicans
in Congress who said you know ban this
and ban Tick Tock Mitt Romney Mitt
Romney said shoot down the balloon and
ban tick tock here's the important part
Tick Tock just became a visual story
because tick tock's a concept right you
think your screen but it's not really a
physical thing
but the
um
but the balloon is physical
so we all have the visual and if I've
taught you nothing about persuasion it's
that the visual persuasion is always the
persuasive one
talk talk talk doesn't persuade people
but you see a picture
let's say the picture of climate change
with that hockey stick graph you know
picture of a Dying uh polar bear the
reason that the climate change has to be
turned into some kind of a visual is to
sell it so you need the graph that
scares you and the dead polar bear and
the and the hurricanes and that story so
quite accidentally nobody planned this
but the story about the Spy balloon is
in our brains too close to the tick tock
story right
just a little too close so our brains
have just combined those into one story
and I'll bet you'll see more and more of
it today
I'll bet you'll see Tick Tock and and
the balloon mentioned in the same
sentence a whole bunch of times today
watch watch the coverage on the news
today watch especially Fox News and
watch how many times Tick Tock and the
Chinese spy balloon are mentioned in the
same sentence
and because we've said the Spy balloon
must be shot down there's no doubt about
it
that that will uh
that will what you say let's say
spillover
or it will infect our other thoughts
about Tick Tock so the urgency of tick
tock
just took on the urgency of the balloon
and you could argue whether the balloon
really is urgent but we're treating it
like it is the public is treating it in
congresses is treating it like why the
hell are you waiting right now the the
time to shoot down the spy plane is
right now okay second question how long
should you wait before you get rid of
tick tock
the argument's the same right
if you think it's wrong to let the spy
plane just sit up there and slowly
transverse the United States if you're
okay with that
well I can see why you'd be okay with
tick tock
but if you're saying shoot down that
shoot down that balloon you can't say
shoot down the balloon while you don't
say shoot down tick tock
those two stories just became melted
together you can't now you couldn't even
pull them apart if you tried
that's the biggest story
the biggest story is that those two
things just became one thing
that's really big
I don't know if anybody else would
mentioned it but watch for that
well um I don't know if you saw the back
but I did come up with uh I was just
brainstorming some solutions for taking
the balloon out and
what we need to do is uh maybe try to
position representative swalwell below
the balloon as it's Crossing this will
take a little math but I think we could
do it uh then you use a Bic lighter
sneak up behind them get the timing
right light the lighter uh his own
natural flatulence will form a missile
now I haven't done the calculations I
believe this will get you to at least 70
000 feet
does that does that sound reasonable
yeah I think you could get 70 000 feet
out of this
um
we'll take out that
stick and then this that balloon
well let's talk about something else so
Twitter blue is looking uh like a better
deal every minute I finally signed up
today I tried to sign up earlier but
because I was already a blue check for
some reason I couldn't do it until now
or or recently so here are the things
that you can do with Twitter blue
um I sent a tweet and it told me I had
30 minutes to edit it
this very moment this very morning I
deleted a tweet because I didn't want to
re-edit it
so I wish I'd remembered that this
feature was there so I I accidentally
tweeted about the Chinese by playing
when I meant to say balloon so I just
deleted it because I was busy didn't
want to retweet it but that's exactly
one that I would have just edited and
kept
um
Twitter apparently I don't know the
details is looks like they're going to
go big on video
oh you corrected me thank you
um it looks like Twitter's going to go
big on video which they have to right I
mean
is there any question that they have to
yeah of course they have to so that's
the right move
the 30-minute status that's the right
move the paid subscription so that
Twitter doesn't have to depend on
Advertising so much that's the right
move because you can still use it
without the paid features and here's my
favorite part
apparently the Twitter blue users only
will be paid for any advertisements that
appear in the comments to their tweets
I think this is just one of the best
monetization schemes I've seen
because advertisements in your comments
seem much less bothersome don't they
because you sort of have to go to the
comments to see them I like that and I
like I like that
the ad the ad won't even be there unless
you did a good tweet
so my incentive to tweet in ways that
get people engaged
is now it's monetized
I'm I'm definitely
um
yeah I'm definitely incentivized by that
so we'll we'll see how that works now of
course it's a you know some of these
things are a risk to the locals platform
and some other competing stuff but I
think they all get better if they
compete
so I think I think it's just all good so
so far
uh Elon musk's let's say entrepreneurial
instincts for Twitter
appear to be right on what do you think
I would say his instincts so far
are right on
yeah now that's not to say he won't have
some missteps because that's how it
works right he's moving fast and
breaking things and correcting he said
he was going to do that he told us
directly I'm going to move fast break
things correct it and then he did right
in front of you this is one of the
greatest lessons in entrepreneurial
strategy and managing and thinking that
you'll ever see because you don't get
this much transparency normally like his
thought process has been you know public
the whole time it's amazing he also won
his lawsuit
so there's a lawsuit when he he had
teased about taking Tesla private
but then that didn't happen and people
made decisions about it I guess and sued
him he won unanimous unanimous trial
Victory just a clean one so good for him
it's one less thing that to distract him
from
his work
did you catch that the number of jobs
employers added over half a million jobs
to the payrolls in January
that do you know how big that is like if
you don't follow jobs you might not
recognize how big that is that's really
really big that's like crazy big
how many people expected that well you
know who didn't expect it
economists
right so the labor department uh well
it's a labor department reported this
over half a million but uh according to
Wall Street Journal uh far more than
economists expected
so the forecaster surveyed by The Wall
Street Journal had estimated 187 000
jobs would be created or filled I guess
or created I guess created jobs
and unemployment's down to three points
something
that's amazing that's really good
um
but here's my first point
our best economists
could not predict jobs
one quarter in advance
or one month one month
our best Economist in the world could
not predict jobs something pretty basic
even in the ballpark they weren't even
in the ballpark
so how do you think they're doing
predicting the other stuff
do you believe any of their other
predictions
all right what is the consensus at the
moment especially based on these numbers
what is the consensus for what 2023 will
look like economically
it looks like it's going to be either
the softest recession
we'll definitely be struggling with the
inflation for a while but it looks like
it's a mild recession
now
do you remember my prediction for 2023
how many people remember my prediction
when everybody was saying it's going to
be a bad bad year
I was Aryan was I not
I believe I was
I don't know did anybody else say it was
mild when I was saying was mild and the
reason I said it would be mild
is the Adam's law of slow-moving
disasters
that we that we're really good at
quickly adjusting to stuff and I I
reckoned that what was different about
the pandemic
is that we would still come back with
all the demand and skills that we had
before
so the pandemic didn't really break
something
we just had to go back and use the stuff
we already had
so it seemed to me that we could quick
adjust
because all the the assets were in place
that's that's the part that takes a long
time
it looks like maybe we are maybe you are
and do you remember also what is the
number one economic number that I've
told you to focus on
if I told you you'd only if if you could
yeah jobs that look at employment
so that's my rule of thumb if you don't
want to learn a lot about economics
if the employment is good employment
level and jobs you can make everything
else work
just as sort of a general rule now
nothing is an absolute right you know I
suppose anything could go wrong but if
you get the jobs right
you're you have a solid base for
tweaking everything else over time and
that's what I saw what I saw was that
the jobs looked like they'd stay strong
and therefore I predicted a mild
recession
so it looks like that's made that that
might
might happen
all right uh
it looks like China is helping Russia
beat our sanctions and get Tech
equipment and chips and stuff
correct me if I'm wrong
but there are sanctions weak
if we can just sell it to some
third-party country and then they just
sell it to Russia
because that's what's happening right
just other countries buy stuff from
other countries and it goes through a
few countries and it ends up in Russia
so China appears to be part of this uh
process but the Wall Street Journal
reports that
um Russia basically
might not be having problems you know we
thought maybe this Tech sanctioned thing
would really cause their economy to
struggle
Maybe not maybe all they need is you
know China and a few other friendly
countries and they're fine maybe we'll
find out so it doesn't look like
sanctions are going to be the BL and all
um
did uh
that's interesting I'm missing something
here that oh here it is
uh chat GPT
um I saw I saw a individual on Instagram
I think
who would say he had a sneak preview I
guess he might have been a beta tester
for uh an AI app
that would be associated with this chat
GPT now you all know chat GPT it's the
huge big sexy AI that people are playing
with the app if I understand it
correctly would be connected to the
internet
I don't have all the details because
it's not announced yet yeah so it'd be
an AI app for your iOS device and
presumably your other ones do and
uh you can just have conversations with
it
could you imagine having an app on your
phone that you could just talk to and it
could go off and do things
now I'm going to blow your mind you you
want your mind blown
what's the worst thing about having AI
on your current phone
let me tell you the worst part about
having AI
hey I want to use my phone oh that's
right I got a password okay password
okay I gotta open my app all right open
the app okay it's all auto filled with
that last app I was searching for delete
that last step put in GPS if I open the
app
okay it's asking me you're now for a
password I'll send that to my other
phone
uh send it to my other device check my
other device put in the code
open the app
right now that's your experience right
how much how much would you use an app
if you had to do all that now of course
you could do your voice commands but it
still takes like 10 seconds if I have to
wait 10 seconds for the app I'm not
using it
right but suppose
suppose your phone was designed from the
bottom up
and it was only an AI interface
and it was always on
and you could just talk to it
if you saw your phone maybe maybe use
your watch or something that talks to
your phone but you just say
um can you make me a reservation as
close as you can get to 7 p.m at
whatever's a good restaurant in town
now the I guess Google actually can do
that for you can make a reservation but
imagine AI taking on all of that
I would I would just use it as my friend
and I would talk to it all day long I
can't imagine not talking to it because
I always have curiosity when I'm driving
do you
every time I drive I want to be Googling
something I'll be driving along and like
today I have a question about
how many casualties would Russia have to
suffer
before it was unsustainable
and I thought I wonder if there's some
kind of rule of thumb about casualties
like if you get to some percentage and
you're an attacking Force you know
you'll give up but maybe if you're a
defending Force you'll take you know
more casualties so I thought I wonder if
there's some rule of thumb
but I always think of these things when
I'm driving
and that I can't search them and then I
forget them later
so if I could just be in my car and go
you know hey Chad GPT you know look this
up for me and then it just starts
talking to me and asking if that's the
right answer and I say no I was really
looking for this
this is going to change everything I I
don't think
I don't I don't think anybody including
me
has
grasped
what the next year is going to look like
let me call out these NPCs for those of
you who would like to point out that I'm
a boomer
may I add this comment
you're worthless
you're you're freaking worthless
I I'm pretty sure we all know my age we
all know what that implies
and I'm pretty sure that nothing I said
is boober specific all right if the best
you can do
is make a comment about my age
you're really not smart enough to be on
this live stream you should just go away
just go do something easier
you know something something more to
your level of capability if that's all
you got oh he looks like he's a boomer I
think he's talking about smartphones and
now he's a boomer well he's also a
boomer hey has anybody noticed
the last 15
stop it
almost cursed but did not
almost cursed but did not did not
but
if you would just take a moment over on
YouTube this is more of a YouTube
Problem on YouTube could you just take a
moment and look at the other comments
do you see how many of them are using
the word Boomer
you can have some confidence that
they've covered it
is covered
you don't need to say Boomer again
see if you can see if you can hold back
try it use all of your willpower
to not be boring and predictable all
right thank you
speaking of Ukraine
um
how many casualties would it take before
the Russian public gives up on it
so reportedly there are close to 200 000
Russian casualties that would be killed
or wounded yeah just the Ukraine
conflict
there are somewhere around 2 million
Russians in the military
200 000 casualties out of 2 million now
remember that's not two million Fighters
it's closer to a million something maybe
a million five Fighters
that's a pretty big percentage isn't it
pretty big percentage
um
yes more than more than decimated
but you know they're sending fresh
troops in there and of course it's a
dictatorship and and probably the
Russians themselves don't know how many
people are dying but at some point you
can't miss it
and uh it looks like maybe they're half
a million or so
um Russian fighters in the Ukraine
conflict
but if two hundred thousand out of half
a million
were injured or killed
how much
uh
Ukraine says more like a no 130 000 is
how many they added
so I I was fooled by that at first so
they talk about adding 130 but that
doesn't account for the ones that are
already there
so I think it's closer to 400 000
something like that
thanks for taking the high road
uh Russia says 7 000 yeah
well I guess that's my question to me it
seems like uh Russia might be pushing up
against some kind of rule of thumb that
says if you lose this percentage of your
army you better pull back
it sounds like World War II casualty
rates so far
right but remember that casualty rate is
just going to climb right because there
aren't that many new Russians they can't
send in as many as the ukrainians are
killing
so
if it's already at World War II casualty
levels which is probably true
we might be zooming past that level
right you have Vietnam was 50 000 dead
how many casualties though
what were the Vietnam casualties 50 000
dead right
59 000. I think that's dead what is the
casualty number
Still Counting oh that's terrible yeah
still counting
uh okay so I have that but
yeah I think it's uh if you're the
attacking Force probably you can take
fewer casualties
all right and that ladies and gentlemen
oh just one more thing Jeb Bush has a
or an opinion piece in the Wall Street
Journal where he was talking about how
great the move toward
um School choices I guess Florida's been
a leader in school choice for a long
time ever since Jeb so I give him credit
for that
but he said there's a 2022 real clear
opinion research poll found that more
than 72 percent of parents supported
school choice including 68 percent of
Democrats and 82 percent of Republicans
and 67 percent of independents
that Jeb Bush that feels like the
cleanest political issue you could ever
have
is there any other political issue where
even the other side two-thirds of them
are on your side
I can't think of one
so if the Republicans can't make that
work
I mean I don't know why you can
how in the world can a republican lose a
national election and this
you'd have to say all the wrong things
the only way you could lose is by
sabotaging yourself
150 000 casualties in World War I'm
sorry in uh Vietnam that that's a number
of somebody just put up there
150 sounds right
it's about triple the number of kills
so
um
so Russia is already Beyond and Russia
has a smaller population right than the
United States so as a percentage
they're already they've already exceeded
the level that made America shut down
War
is that true
give me a fact check on that so here's
the statement I want you to fact check
that the United States shut down the
Vietnam War
at a certain level of uh casualties but
that's relative to our population
if you adjust for population
Russia has already passed the point
that the American public shut down a war
is that true
and that was over 10 years right our
casualties were spread over 10 years
whereas uh Ukraine is pretty small no
that would not be an analogy exactly
I mean I get what you're saying but it
would be more like uh
looking for a rule of thumb
which might not exist right so so as an
analogy it's weak but as a point of
research
it might be useful to find that if
there's any kind of you know
psychological limit that's Universal
because I have a feeling that people
have a a fairly similar view of how much
is too much
in a given situation like it would
depend on the situation
but
I think we would here here's the
proposition if you took anybody from any
country
and you simply describe the situation
you go okay there's this war and the
people that you love are dying at this
level
and the war is for this reason and who
started it and who didn't if you explain
that to like any human beings
my hypothesis is they would have a
weirdly similar view of what was too
much
what do you think
brother I I don't think some people
would say we will fight till every
person is dead
and I don't think anybody would say you
know that's already too much I think
people would
end up in the same general zone of what
is too much
just a speculation you know there's no
science to that
um
yes and as somebody said about the
Vietnam Vets their casualties are still
happening based on you know lagging
health issues
um
okay there's a long comment there
all right that's all I got now
you can't compare one country to any
other country well that's the
speculation
the the speculation or the hypothesis is
that
if you if you break down the question
into like just a clean question this
many people of your side is being killed
for this purpose
I think that the cultural part would be
less important than you think I think
you would find that people are kind of
similar
that's just hypothesis might be wrong
that's why you test it
other cultures aren't so weak now see
that that's where we we differ on our
speculation you might be right
but
um I think well let me say this if you
were comparing to Modern economies
I'll bet they would be closer to each
other than say a modern economy and you
know something not there might be a
difference there
all right do you believe that America is
weaker like psychologically
how many of you believe America is weak
here's what I think
we might be weak in some specific ways
compared to how we were
but we certainly have a lot more toys
we have more weapons and we're certainly
better at it killing people I would
think
so my guess is that we're more badass
than we've ever been
but the the most
um
I think I love it about American culture
and character
the one thing America does better than
anybody
and I won't take an argument on this I
will accept no no pushback to this the
one thing Americans do better than
everybody else
is criticize ourselves
productively
productively
you can't even do that in Canada
right if you go to Canada or Great
Britain you can't even say this the same
things you can say in America and you
know it got it got pretty dicey over
here but America we will we will beat
ourselves up
so much better than you'll beat us up
right good luck beating us up more than
we beat ourselves up like we beat
ourselves up for practice
right so that's also why we can tear
down our institutions and rebuild them
faster because we love saying stuff
sucks oh that sucks let's get we're
actually talking about dismantling just
hold this in your head
imagine any other country on Earth
doesn't matter if they're a dictatorship
or democracy imagine any other country
on Earth and just hold this thought in
your head
we're having a serious conversation in
America about disbanding the FBI
just hold that in your head where else
where else do you have a serious
conversation about that now I don't
think it's going to happen right that's
a different question but that's a
serious conversation
right and and the ATF that conversation
right
tell me any other country where that's a
serious conversation
only here
we will take on anything
we're completely unafraid about
criticizing ourselves
and that ladies and gentlemen
is why the United States will rule
as long as that's true as long as we're
tougher on ourselves than other people
are on us and that's definitely the case
we're pretty much Unstoppable
now
there's definitely some kind of a
testosterone change that's happened we
all agree on that right I mean science
science has proven there's lower
testosterone in men much lower
agree
yeah so that's definitely something to
be worried about but I don't think it's
translated yet into our national
effectiveness
because the people who joined the
military
well let me ask you
do you think our military is a bunch of
I kind of doubt it oh you think so
really
no I don't think so I I think that our
training uh our training process gets
rid of anybody who can't kill
that you know that's too much of an
absolute but I think that the process
itself guarantees you end up with
killers
maybe I have too much confidence in
brainwashing
but I think you can brainwash almost all
of them to turn them into killers
of some type you know they might be
killing with a drone instead of a
bayonet but you could make them all into
killers
and the ones that you can't you would
know fairly soon and you would wash them
out
so I'm not really worried about that
I'm not really worried
yeah and they might be support forces
and everything else
you know I would be
the the one thing we never run out of in
America
is people willing to kill our enemies
we always have plenty of them like
I don't think we're going to run out
uh
you could sit me down and show me all
right I don't know what you would show
me
yeah and we might be fighting entirely
with robots pretty soon anyway
I mean that makes sense doesn't it
why would we fight with humans if we can
fight with robots and drones we wouldn't
killing an attacker is a different
mindset yeah anybody could do that
well any man could
most women could too as well
yeah if somebody's attacking you sure
when will the coffee mugs be available
again
um we don't have a plan for that but if
demand
demand is Sky High I'm sure we could
make it happen
Scott's imaginary fentanyl dealers in
China
well here's my thing on China's fentanyl
dealers
we know they're not trying to stop them
it is not my belief that fentanyl can be
stopped
so that's not why I would be hard on on
China I would be hard on them because
they're killing us
I don't need a better reason
they're intentionally killing us so we
should go kill all of their uh all of
their dealers
if they're not going to shut them down
so what the dealers do is they China
does change the laws to make it illegal
but then the dealers will modify the
fentanyl a little bit the precursors
they'll modify the precursors so that
they're just slightly technically
outside of the control of the government
but the government knows that right the
Chinese government knows that they'll
just tweak it and keep going so it's not
like they're really trying to stop them
right see if they're really trying to
stop it would be different so if China
is killing us
you kill them back
every time
you don't say well I've got to argument
I don't think it'll stop the fentanyl no
I'm not saying you should you should
kill their dealers to stop fentanyl
because it really wouldn't it wouldn't
make that much difference you should
kill them because they're killing us
you kill everybody who kills you no
exception
right as soon as you say oh well there's
an exception you can kill us under these
circumstances no no you can't kill us
under any circumstances there is no
right time you can kill us
you will be killed if you do that and we
should be putting assets into China to
directly take out their dealers and we
should not even apologize for it
we should actually say yeah we did that
that was us
thank you very much that was us we we
took care of that for you
it's too bad shy they couldn't do it
themselves it's embarrassing isn't it
it's kind of embarrassing to be Chinese
isn't it if we take out their if we take
out their dealers and maybe we have you
know we wouldn't know
as possible we actually have but if we
take out their dealers because they
couldn't I would publicize that
I would not hide from that I would not
make that a clandestine operation I
would put that on the front page of the
newspaper yep we took out your precursor
dealers
it's too bad you couldn't do it
yeah I would push that right in your
face
I wouldn't hide that for one second
because they're not gonna they're not
gonna trigger a war over that
they're just not that's a free punch
we could send American assets into
Chinese soil
kill their precursor
manufacturers tell them we did it show
them the pictures tell them how we did
it when we did it and tell them we're
going to do it again
we can do that and there would be no
military risk to that
I mean they they try to retaliate in
their smaller ways but it wouldn't be a
full War
and I would also make sure that we told
the world we're not we don't think that
stops Fentanyl
that's not why you do it
that's not the only reason you do it we
did it because you're doing this to us
that's it
uh
Trump could do that
the raw materials other produce things
that Scots likes yeah
and
um I don't have any problem with legal
precursors sold to Legal people
only 15 of the modern infantry has fired
their weapons and somebody said
that sounds right
you know
there are some situations where killing
is exactly the right answer
does anybody disagree with that
you don't want to do it you know to
willy-nilly but there are some
situations that where murder
is exactly the right answer
unfortunately I mean you know we don't
like it but that's just the fact
all right
um yeah technically it wouldn't be
murder it would be murder in China but
it wouldn't be murder to us it would be
killing
why do we kill those who cannot control
the thing for which we kill them you
need a better example
um
yeah innocence get killed that's true
so it was a negative 106 degrees in
Mount Washington in New Hampshire
negative 106. how long can you stay
alive in negative 106.
like a minute
that's like walking outside the Space
Capsule
Scott doesn't criticize Biden for
fentanyl why not
Frank
Frank
are you serious
there there's somebody who who's
watching me
who's concerned that I haven't bitched
enough about Fentanyl and the government
not doing enough
seriously
seriously
you know that's practically my middle
name
all right
yeah you're really running out of
insults here's the best insult that
Raymond could come up with for me they
took an intellectual heavyweight Stefan
molyneux off YouTube and offer Scott
Adams an intellectual bantamweight from
California
if any of your friends or family ever
told you how much you suck
like you're really a garbage human being
imagine coming on to
a live stream and what you wanted to add
was just a personal insult that wasn't
even related to a topic
not even related to the point
it's just I'd like to go make a personal
insult to somebody I don't know by
comparing him to some other person
now honestly
you should you should analyze your life
why was that the best thing you had to
do at this moment
there was nothing else that was better
to do more useful productive learning
something for example
helping somebody
was that the best you could do today
that that was all you had
now and do you do this the rest of the
day
do you leave here and then say huh I
think I'll Target some other people for
generic insults
I can't think of anything that would
make you less useful as a human being
I have a feeling that your entire life
is just one worthless encounter after
another like about with your family they
all think you're worthless
just a guess
but based on that small encounter
probably nobody likes you
that's my guess and if somebody's acting
like they do they're probably just lying
they probably hate you behind your back
because I could tell just from that one
comment you're a piece of crap
really bad human being
and you shouldn't be here
you should go somewhere where bad people
hang out
I don't know where that is
yeah
so somebody says I get I get why your ex
left you
do you think my ex would have disliked
what I just did
you have never met my ex
no I think my ex would have enjoyed this
and of course I don't
talk like this to people who are not
ridiculously worthless pieces of crap
yeah so I only talk like that to people
who have earned it they've earned it
but you've heard it
um
your daughter-in-law Pastor citizenship
test yesterday
what's her name James we'll give her a
little hand I love it when people pass
their citizenship test you know there's
there's almost there are very few things
that make me feel more patriotic
do you get the same feeling so
congratulations
um to your daughter-in-law what was that
daughter-in-law you said congratulations
I just love it when somebody passes
their citizenship test
because the first thing is you have to
recognize they know more about this
country than the citizens
have you ever uh have you ever tried the
citizenship test
I have it's not so easy it's not as easy
as you think it would be you know I have
a pretty good you know General
government knowledge but I wouldn't get
them all
I would not get them all now I do think
some of the questions are a little
unnecessary but they they do cause you
to study all the other stuff and
I I just love it when people
you know want to be an American enough
that they'll go through that process and
then they pass it and then I say welcome
aboard
yeah the the legal the legal immigrants
were 100 on board the illegal ones we
have some conversations about some
different opinions there
all right uh Marianne is your name
what's that Scott are you on a test
replacement
what's a test replacement I don't know
what that means
Oh you mean testosterone replacement
no no I'm not I'm not supplementing
testosterone
I just had my levels checked and I'm
happy with everything
all right
um
except my vitamin D was a little low so
I'm boosting that a little bit I was
already boosting it but giving it a
little bit extra
all right
um
maybe the balloon is full of migrants
what's your BP doing uh I have to check
it I think it's fine
here's your vitamin D low because you
never go outside well actually that's
not true I go outside every day to get
vitamin D so let me tell you a new thing
that I've been doing when it's not
raining too hard so every morning after
I'm done with this and I get cleaned up
I take the dog to the park that's just
my favorite Park
and I do my outdoor nature thing
so apparently if you spend you know 20
minutes in nature is set you for the
whole day have you ever heard that
it really does seem to work
I can say that those days when I go just
stand in the park for 20 minutes and I
also do the the Andrew hooverman
breathing technique
where you do the two inhales to your
nose and then exhale through your mouth
and it totally relaxes me so I do
breathing exercises and a nature hit at
the same time I'm walking my dog
so I get all three things at the same
time it definitely now I haven't tried
the barefooting I'm curious about that
you know what that is right what is
called uh something grounding or
something where you if you're Barefoot
on actual dirt
and the Earth
somehow that's supposed to make your
body feel good
I need to try that
the only reason I don't try it I don't
like getting my feet dirty
but I I can say for sure
that a hundred percent of the days that
I've walked on a beach
was a good day
Colonel McGregor
um is that I saw a bunch of people say
colonel McGregor but I don't know that
story what's happening with Colonel
McGregor
was he the one that talked about the
balloon
I don't know the reference there Colonel
McGregor
all right barefoot's always best
yeah
Phil McCracken
all right
um so here's something you probably
didn't know so I live in Northern
California and in theory we get more
sunlight than most places
but in the winter
even in Northern California
we don't get anywhere near enough
vitamin D from the Sun did you know that
I could pretty much you know
to have my shirt off all day and I don't
think I'd get enough because that it's
the quality of the Sun
if the Sun is not you know pretty much
equatorial and you're running around
with your shirt off you're not getting
enough so that's the reason the swedes
well that's one reason the swedes
supplement because there is no situation
where they get enough ever
but even in California I think there are
only
uh I remember I saw this statistic a
while ago but maybe only two or three
months
even in Northern California
where the natural Sun would give you
enough vitamin D if you spend some time
in it I think it's only three months of
the year so if you think that you live
in a sunny place or you're out in the
sun if it's a winter it kind of didn't
count
the winter sun is practically worthless
for a vitamin D did you know that
Perry the cockator
it's the angle of the sun yeah I think
you're right about that
all right
special shoes for grounding I'm not sure
I believe that
that the shoes ground you I mean I'm not
sure I believe the grounding works but
I'll try it
I think I'll try the grounding thing to
see
so I'll put that in my list
all right that's all for now I'll talk
to you on YouTube later and I'll stick
around for the subscribers on locals bye
for now
