hey everybody
come on in come on in
this is the time you made it
congratulations
the first thing you were trying to do
today for many of you
you gotta write yeah you're here on time
ready for the simultaneous step and
being ready
isn't just a state of mind no you
also have to have a copper mug or glass
a tanker chelsea steiner canteen chunk
or flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with what that's right your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
here today the thing that makes
everything better including the
temperature
in texas yeah it's working
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
now the coffee doesn't warm texas by
itself
because science right science
you also need tedku ted cruz to not be
in cancun
suppose you only had coffee but ted cruz
was still in cancun
would that warm texas no
no not even a little bit but if you have
the simultaneous sip
you also have ted cruz leaving cancun
like a hero really a hero
comes all the way back to the united
states the temperature immediately turns
around
today it looks like we'll be above
freezing in many places in texas
the power is being restored to all but
18 000 people so far
i don't know if it's too early for some
kind of uh
presidential medal of freedom or
something for ted cruz
but what did you do did you do anything
to help
in texas oh sure some of you sent
money and yeah you did things like that
but did you do what ted cruz did left
cancun
came back to the united states boom
problem solved
that's the way you do it did you see any
democrats doing that
no no there was not one democrat
who came back from cancun to the united
states to help texas
i'll bet there were democrats in in
cancun don't you think there must have
been a few
none of them came back to warm up the
state
disgraceful
well one of the funniest uh
things happening right now is that as
you know
cnn hired a permanent fact-checker
named daniel dale and he was there just
fact checking the crap out of president
trump oh he was so busy fact-checking
and fact-checking
but what do you do when trump's out of
office and you fight
you hired a fact-checker now they didn't
say
he's the trump fact-checker in which
case you'd say well he'll need another
job
he was the fact-checker so you can't
really
fire the fact-checker on the same day
that biden is inaugurated
can you that would be a little bit too
on the nose wouldn't it
so you got to kind of you're kind of
trapped
bureaucratically you're kind of trapped
and they're probably sitting there
saying
oh crap we can't really
fire the fact checker the first day we
get the new president
everybody would know we were just doing
it to get trump
so he keeps his job
but if you have a job you cannot do it
you got to do some fact checking now
what what would
daniel dale's career look like
if he came to work every day and said
well it's another day of joe biden not
telling a single lie
he wouldn't have a job anymore right so
in order for daniel dale to keep his job
he's going to have to do a little fact
checking on biden
and so there's there's now a video
package
that's you know on top of the fact he's
already fact-checked
uh biden's town hall but now it's a
video package
now it doesn't get a lot of play on the
cnn website i mean but it's there
so he's he's plugging along doing his
job and
debunked i guess several uh
uh numbers statistical claims that biden
had completely wrong
and to me this is just the funniest part
of the whole thing
is that they desperately i'm guessing
right i'm just speculating in mind
reading right now
but don't you think that the management
as cnn
wishes this guy didn't have his job
anymore
because what can he do he can't not fact
check him
he's the fact checker so they're a
little bit trapped
all right news today is that kanye is
divorcing kim kargat kardashian
so if you had voted for kanye for
president
under the hopes that your your first
lady would be kim kardashian
apparently that would have been a bad
move although
has there ever been a first lady who got
divorced or called for a divorce
while being first lady i feel as though
if he if kanye made it to the white
house
that maybe kim kardashian would have
said well i'll postpone this a little
bit
a little bit but
what would have been more fun i'm just
hypothetically of course it wasn't close
to happening but
i'm just saying what if kanye
had been president and then become
single
what would a single president
kanye be worth in terms of entertainment
value to the rest of the country
oh oh a lot a lot
can you imagine anything more fun
than kanye as president and
single seriously
come on you would vote for him
just to see that i mean i like the
country to do well
and all that and i actually think kanye
could do a pretty darn good job as
president like literally
genuinely truly i think he could do a
good job as president
no hyperbole no joke in case you think
it's a joke it's not i think he could
actually do
the job well but damn would he be
entertaining
oh my god i want that to happen i don't
think it will but
i want it there's good news about
vaccines
apparently mayo clinic has determined
that if you get the vaccination
uh they were worried that you could also
be a carrier that you could have like a
some kind of low-level infection that
doesn't bother you necessarily ever
but you might be able to spread it and
now
it's upwards now they think it's upwards
of 80 effective in preventing
infection in the first place
which makes sense to me i mean it kind
of makes sense that it would
do that so now we've got the
single dose coming we've got new news
that the vaccination is better than we
thought
things are looking good except for that
we're approaching
in the united states another milestone
which is uh looks like a bad one
half a million deaths
half a million now the number of deaths
from the regular flu
is reported to be around 10 of that
so is there anybody left who says this
is just the flu
now that it has killed allegedly and i
don't i don't believe the number of
deaths from the regular flu
but it's reported it's in that you know
fifty thousand
range i think between thirty and eighty
thousand let's say fifty thousand
if we hit half a million on the
coronavirus
it is ten times as deadly
is there anybody left who still says
it's just the flu
ten times as deadly now i know some of
you are saying but they're counting it
wrong
it's not really half a million it's a
smaller number even if it's a smaller
number
it's three times as bad or something
uh yeah so people say i don't believe
the number of deaths
well let's get to that speaking of fake
news
actually we'll do that next so cnn has
decided to go
full racist and see if see if this is
too strong
okay so i'm making the claim right now
the cnn's coverage last night was fully
transparently obviously
just racist like seriously racist
like as racist as you can be i'm not
talking about the
the woke kind of racist you know where
you're
somebody offended somebody but you're
not sure there was any racial
racist intent or even maybe racist
outcome
of any serious kind i'm not talking
about the woke stuff
i'm talking about the real like classic
worst stuff you can have kind of racism
now i'm going to describe what they did
and then you tell me if i'm
over interpreting it am i going too far
is this hyperbole
let me tell you what they did so their
reporting is
that there are a number of uh state
laws being floated to restrict
voting restrict voting in a variety of
ways
such as limiting the use of drop boxes
eliminating sunday voting requiring
ids for mail-in voting etc so
so things along those lines now every
one of these has the effect
of decreasing the number of people who
could who are likely to vote
because every time you put any friction
on something
what happens anybody have you ever
listened to me talk about friction
whenever you add friction less of
something happens
that's how friction works whenever you
remove friction
or reward something you get more of it
so
wouldn't you expect that if they
restrict voting you'll get
less voting that doesn't sound good
right even though what they're trying to
stop is the illegal voting
but you would probably go beyond that
wouldn't you you
there's no doubt about it there's nobody
here who's an adult
who doubts the fact that these things
would re
would decrease the number of black
voters is there anybody who would doubt
that
does anybody think that it wouldn't
decrease the number of black voters
of course it would because it would
decrease
wait for it all voters
it would it would decrease all voters
now let me ask you this are the in
georgia one of georgia's one of the
states
that's being looked at for doing exactly
this kind of stuff
i don't know the demographics but
wouldn't it be true
that there are more poor white people
still than poor black people
check check my work on this because i'm
not positive
that when i get to my ultimate point
that i haven't missed something okay
so i'm going to give you this statement
with a 65
level confidence on my side it goes like
this
if you do something to add friction and
it's the kind of friction
that will grind on people on the low end
of the economic
spectrum so i would say that every one
of these voting restrictions
would hit hardest at people who are on
the low end of the economic
ladder you'd agree with that right
pretty much
any kind of friction on the on voting is
you know it's going to hit the low
economic group harder
they may not be able to take the day off
to vote
unless they get a sunday they may not be
able to drive
might not even have a car so if you can
you know
it might not even have bus fare so if
you can drop off
your ballot at the dropbox
more likely to do it requiring id
if you're low low economic situation
maybe you're less likely to have id so
the things we can agree on
so far is that poor people would be hit
the hardest with any restrictions
at least these kind everything we're
talking about hits poor people the
hardest
number two fewer black people would be
expected to vote
because among the category of poor
people you have a number of black people
and percentage-wise i think this is
still true right
percentage-wise the percentage of black
people in the bad economic situation
would be a higher percentage than say
white people
so far that's all true right have i said
anything that's not true yet
but here's the part i'm wondering about
you don't
vote for president with a percentage you
don't say
hey somebody won a percentage of the
black vote so they can be
president you still have to win the most
number of votes
right you don't get to be president
unless you get the most
number of votes it's a quantity thing
it's not a percentage thing so aren't
there
way more poor white people everywhere
or is that different say in some
georgia's
cities for example where maybe it's a
is important to the electoral college
process
so the question i'm asking somebody's
pointing at the electoral college right
so there might be some places such as
some individual cities
in which you would exactly have the
impact of the more poor black people
there quantity wise as well as
percentage
and therefore maybe that could change
the vote
but basically cnn is making the case
that anything that affects poor people's
uh voting will affect black
people more that's racist
that's like pure racist that's not even
a little bit
not racist there's not even an argument
against is there is there any argument
on the other side i don't even know what
the counter argument would be
i'm not even saying the counter argument
is right or wrong i don't
think there is one if you're saying that
poor black people have less capability
this is what cnn is saying
effectively effectively sagness this
that a poor black person would have less
capability
to solve how to vote than a poor white
person
that's what they're saying effectively
they don't say that directly
but by saying that it's racist to make
these changes you are saying
that somehow poor white people have this
extra capability
to figure out how to vote on a sunday or
to get an id
i don't know that there's any data that
backs that up is there
and again i will accept the idea that as
a percentage
it would be a bigger percentage
hit on the black population but we don't
elect presidents based on percentages
you still have to get the most number of
votes and if there are more
poor white people isn't it affecting
that
more than the smaller group of poor
black people
i i'm really uncomfortable with this
idea
that well i don't have to say more about
it
i think i find it uncomfortably racist
the way they talk about it but the point
of
it i have a complete agreement with by
the way
so philosophically
and in terms of what is good and bad of
course
you don't want to disadvantage one group
over another so of course
you don't want new rules that will you
know disenfranchise any group
if you can do it all right um and
look at some of these rules like calling
early voting lists
so basically the activity of getting rid
of
voters that you know should not be
registered for
your real reasons how in the world is
that racist
it's racist to talk about it as racist
but it's not racist
to have an accurate account of who can
vote
i mean this is crazy stuff all right
let's talk about
uh how to determine fake news i tweeted
around this morning that
apparently finland is teaching
children as young as six how to spot
fake news
so finland has decided that a national
priority
is teaching children to spot fake news
how how cool is that can you imagine
anything that would be really more
useful than that
to teach a child that's just about the
most useful
smartest thing i've heard in a long time
right i can't think of anything that
would be more useful
as an educational concept now obviously
you need to read and write and do math
but in terms of beyond that
teaching people to spot that's
really
important now at the same time
in a weird coincidence or not there's an
article in the new york times
the same same day that i see this
finland story the new york times has a
story
about a uh a digital literacy expert at
a washington state university in
vancouver
mr caulfield and he's developed a
four-point process for
for figuring out if news is fake
and i'll tell you his method and then
we'll compare it to mine in a moment
so the four steps of this number one so
you read a story
and you want to know if it's true or
fake news
the first thing you do is slow down to
think about it right
so step one is stop don't just read it
and move on
right so the first thing you do is stop
two
investigate the source who exactly is
saying this
good so far right number three find it
better coverage in other words find a
new
source which you trust more
just fell apart didn't it so
in his four point process i haven't even
got to the fourth point
and you know the process doesn't work
because the third point is find better
coverage
if you had that capability you would not
be fooled by fake news in the first
place
you don't know what is the better
coverage do you
is it cnn
is it msnbc is that your better coverage
is it or is it fox news is it breitbart
so by the third of his four points it
completely falls apart it couldn't
possibly work
in the real world because
we don't know what the better coverage
is do you know why
the fake news fools us about what the
better coverage we can't tell
now i feel like i can tell and so
do you don't you you feel like you can
tell
i'll bet you think you can tell but
that's the problem
some of you are right some of you can
tell but can the average person
do you think the average news consumer
who is more of a casual news consumer
if you're watching this live stream
you're probably in the
i don't know top five percent of people
who
pay attention to news otherwise you
wouldn't be here
but the general country they're not
paying attention that much
they can't tell which are good sources
of news that's just not something
they'll ever be able to do
if they're casual consumers
but then the fourth one is trace the
claims courts and media to the original
context so this is good so the
find people hoax for example if you had
traced it to the original context
played the original video you would have
known it was a hoax
but who in the world
is gonna do this you open up your
your home page there are let's say on
fox news or cnn maybe 25 stories
and all of them are reasonably important
you know to the to the world
are you gonna fact check on your own and
you know go look for other sources and
stuff for 25 stories a day
no no you're not there there's no human
[Music]
way you're going to do this work but
there is one
uh interesting tidbit so
i'm going to ignore the the four steps i
don't think they're well devised
to actually work but he does say one
thing that's good don't do a deep
dive on something that you're not sure
is
true because by the time you're done
you'll think it was true so if you go if
you find a video that say
an hour or two long and it's like this
whole conspiracy theory
if you take if you make the mistake of
watching the whole two hours
and you don't go check anything else to
see if it's right or wrong
you will be brainwashed because that two
hours is going to be good
it's going to be really convincing
without any counterpoints
so anything that you go into a deep well
you basically are brainwashing yourself
that's q anon you know q anon sort of
that you know deep well
you spend a lot of time on conspiracies
until you talk yourself into it
so he's mr caulfield is recommending
instead
that instead of doing a deep dive and
and basically
hypnotizing yourself on the topic you
you do a
uh a let's say a shallow dive
and then you take it sideways or lateral
meaning that you check what other people
are saying about the same topic
so that it would be better to spend five
seconds seeing what cnn says and five
seconds seeing what somebody else says
then it would be to spend two hours
looking at what one person says
and that is math i agree on
that's where we're completely agreed in
my book loserthink
loserthink which would be the book i
would give to everybody in finland
who is trying to learn how to determine
what is fake news
in fact it's the best probably the best
book on in the world
on teaching somebody how to find fake
news
and i have one tip in there that i think
is better than these four steps and
better than whatever finland is teaching
their kids
it goes like this in this country anyway
i'm not sure it would work everywhere
but in this country
where we have such a siloed news from
the left
and we have a siloed news from the right
use the following rule
if both of them report the news the same
it's probably true so if they say
there are freezing temperatures in texas
and the power is out
and they both say that it's probably
true
but if one network says that the
president
once called neo-nazis fine people
and you can find another major outlet
that says it didn't happen and here's
why
which one do you trust the one that says
it did happen
or the one who says it did not happen
always go with did not and it doesn't
matter
who said what that's the key point it
doesn't matter if the left says it's
true or the right says it's true
if the other one and it doesn't matter
which of the outlets if there's a major
outlet
that says it's not true and then shows
their work right they've got to show
their work
it's not true and if you follow that
rule you'll be right at least 85 percent
of the time
i i can't tell you it'll work every time
now every once in a while you get
something that fox news says
is true the breitbart says is not
now what do you do because they're both
associated with the right
fox news says it's true the fine people
hoax for example it's
it's opinion people were saying it
wasn't true
but the news people were sort of staying
away from
it like maybe it was true so
you weren't quite sure if you're
watching fox news if that was true or
not for a long time
but if you read breitbart also
associated with you know conservative
viewers it said cleanly no it's not true
and often joel pollock would be the one
and he'd show you why
shows his work oh here's the transcript
you can see it's not true
under those cases who do you believe fox
not so clear
or breitbart that shows you their work
and says it's not true
breitbart all right now i'm not saying
breitbart
always better than fox news i'm saying
that whenever there's one that says it's
not true
doesn't matter who it is left or right
as soon as you see one of them say it
didn't happen
it probably didn't happen now it gets
complicated when you're looking at
the question of did the election was the
election
let's say fraudulent
so you've got two different networks
covering it differently what do you do
so you've got your cnn let's say i'll
just use them as the proxy for the left
you've got cnn saying the election was
fine
uh no evidence whatsoever a fraud you go
over to
fox and it's just non-stop stories about
sketchy stuff now it doesn't prove the
election was fraudulent
and nor does fox make that claim they
didn't say we found
any proof at least the the news part of
it didn't
the opinion people went a little bit
further but i don't think any of them
uh well i don't know i won't it doesn't
matter what the news people said
is what matters to the story now now if
they're a little bit different
what do you do well you've got this
weird story where there
are two potential fake news
one is that the election was fraudulent
and proven
or that we have evidence that you know
is conclusive
and that's just not true we don't and
the other is that
we know for sure it was not fraudulent
well that's not true all we know is we
don't know
that's it we know there's no widespread
there's no evidence that a court has
accepted that there is widespread fraud
we know that's true but we don't know no
fraud happened
that's a whole different question so
they're both
um in a sense there's a little fake news
everywhere on that one so you have to be
careful
all right so that's my rule if
somebody's saying something didn't
happen
and shows their work 85 percent of time
they will be the one that's right
um
uh what you do is you censor anyone
saying there is fraud yeah that will get
you to the same place
right um other stories
on australia's version of sky news
uh there was a host named bernardi who
just
tore apart the american media
and uh for basically protecting joe
biden
and this guy does this major monologue
on sky
dews you know major outlet in australia
saying that it's basically obvious to
everyone that biden is cognitively
declined
and and he went at it hard now it's one
thing
it's one thing to be in this country and
and making claims like hey
you know your president's cognitively
declined
because you automatically think okay you
know you're in the battle
everybody's making accusations about
everybody so you sort of discounted it a
little bit in your head right
because you say well the other team
always says your president is crazy
that's just standard it's like you know
if
if democrats accuse the next republican
president whenever that happens
of being a racist how seriously do you
take it
because you know that if they're
republican they're going to be accused
of being racist so you just discount it
because there's politics within the
country
but seeing somebody from australia
who is just talking about the united
states like
he doesn't have a dog in the fight he's
just talking about it
just observing it and in his view
it's glaringly obvious
that that biden is mentally
unwell and certainly not up to the job
it's just obvious
it hits you different when it comes from
somebody who doesn't have a dog in the
fight
and they're just on the outside just
watching it's like oh
guys hey a little bit obvious
a little bit obvious so that
that was interesting all right um i
would say that aoc
who i praise often for her political
skill
and persuasion but not necessarily her
policies now one of the hits against aoc
is that she has like wild crazy policies
about
uh you know the green new deal and it's
all impractical
i don't i don't criticize her as much as
you do
for that because you know who else had a
plan
that was crazy and impractical
trump when trump ran for office he said
he was going to
literally deport the
what 11 million people living here
without citizenship or
25 million or whatever it was and the
entire time
trump was running i said don't worry
about that
that's not going to happen because it
can't happen it's just not practical
there's just no way to do it then sure
enough when he became president
the very first thing he did practically
was say well not so much
deporting people who've been here a long
time but let's just work on the border
now i said from the beginning it was
always just a big first offer
to make him look like the baddest badass
on immigration
and that once he had established that he
he you
you would be in a position to negotiate
something more
more reasonable but still tough
on immigration so i say the same thing
about aoc in the green new deal which is
there are elements of it
which you have to know she knows are not
a hundred percent
practical but she does the the big ask
just like trump gets all the attention
just like trump weaponizes that energy
and the attention to
take her to the next level just like
trump
so in terms of just technique the
similarities are striking it's
it's the same game plan just different
politics
and so get used to the fact that i will
be saying good things about her
technique
not her policies although sometimes i
might agree with him
here are two things that she's doing
right now that in my opinion
are brilliant politically
so they're i'm not saying they're
brilliant in a real world
way but politically they're brilliant
two things are that she is she
raised i guess two million dollars to
help
in relief and distribute supplies to the
people
in texas who were suffering under the
cold temperatures
now because she's a representative of
the bronx and queens
people say hey shouldn't you be helping
your own district
they got problems too why are you
helping texas
i'll tell you why she's helping texas
because she's
going to run for president someday so
she is establishing herself
as someone who will reach across the
political lines and even the state lines
because she's looking at things from the
big picture way
i hate to tell you it's brilliant
it's brilliant because you know it's ted
cruz estate
it makes ted cruz look bad for going off
to cancun
so she sets up a contrast bad bad ted
cruz goes to cancun
good aoc she'll help any state you even
if you're republican
she'll help you that's really really
good
that's like a plus political material
all right now texas
is also sort of on the bubble isn't it
you could imagine maybe not yet
but you could imagine texas voting for a
democrat for president
because it's getting close right i mean
it used to be real republican but
shrinking that margin now weren't so
sure that trump was gonna
gonna win texas were ya it was close
so aoc picked exactly the right state
with exactly the right play
politically on top of that apparently
she's
uh i didn't i was looking for the story
but i think it's true
that she's backing an investigation of
governor cuomo
on the nursing home stuff now if that's
true
this is her turning against you know a
major
democrat political figure because it's
the right thing to do
now the more times the aoc does
something
that you could describe with these words
because it's the right thing to do
meaning that it's not purely political
although it is right it's so political
that it doesn't look political that's
how well done it is it looks like she's
just crossing the line and
you know doing something for the other
side and just doing the right thing and
ignoring politics
but the way she ignores politics is the
best politics you'll ever see
in the same way by analogy
when ex-president
obama ran for office the first time he
did not run
as a black guy he was a black guy
but if he had made that some kind of
advantage that he was selling
for why he should be elected it would
have worked against him
so his politics obama's politics were
next
level so by ignoring the racial part
that is
our normal politics he just put himself
above it
and then when people said okay you are
kind of putting yourself above it that's
okay
you know we want we want a president
who's you know above that and he's not
running because he's black
right and that allowed people to cross
the lines easily so what aoc is doing is
making it easy
for some republicans in the future
to say you know that's a lot about her i
don't like but
she does have a pattern of being able to
do the right thing
in the bad situations the you know cuomo
situation
the texas situation and she's willing to
go against her own party when it's the
right thing to do
that's really good that is really good
i've always
often said that one of the things that
helped trump is that he
had once been a registered democrat and
he had
you know he had lots of democrat kind of
leanings he was more pro-gay marriage
pro-gay than
than past republicans etc so i think
that trump had that going for him too
which is that he would he would take
what he thought was right
and he could you know sometimes disagree
with his own party
not too often
uh matt taibbi who i mention often
because he's in that
rare group of i guess he'd be called a
journalist i don't know what title he
would like to go by he's got a
popular podcast as well um
author maybe um but
he has this problem i when i track him
you know i just follow him on
twitter where he'll say something
smart and reasonable and people will
just be
triggered into cognitive dissonance
because you don't expect people to be
smart and reasonable
and that alone triggers people into
cognitive dissonance
just the fact that he can talk
objectively
without the political filter about
pretty much anything
he has that special skill it's very rare
or at least rare that people will
exhibit that skill in public
and he does often so watching him have
to deal with the fact that he triggers
people to hallucinate
is fun because that's what i do if
you've ever watched my twitter feed
it's just full of critics who have
misinterpreted something i said
and they're really mad at that
hallucination that exists
only in their head has nothing to do
with anything i said or did
nothing to do with my opinion nothing to
do with my effect on anything
it's a pure hallucination but they're
coming after me
because their hallucinations suggest
that i've done something that
literally never happened said something
i didn't say
meant something i didn't mean something
like that and
for a long time i thought it was just
something about me
or the way i talk or the way i word
things
so i thought i'm just triggering people
there you know i can't even turn it off
if i knew how i'd turn it off right but
watching matt tybee do it you know a
different person
completely different situation for me
and you can
it's more clear when you see the pattern
the pattern is
there's a certain segment that can't
handle it
if you can see both sides of a of a
topic
that's it if you can simply see and
describe
the argument on both sides of a topic
doesn't mean you even picked one
you can simply see them you can just
describe them
accurately that alone will trigger
some percentage of the public into
actually hallucinating
like literally imagining they saw or
heard something that didn't happen
or read something that didn't happen and
so i'm glad it's not just happening to
me but
it's it's literally that's all it takes
to trigger cognitive dissonance
acknowledging the other argument that's
it that's all it takes
uh woody allen is gonna have a bad month
i guess there's some new woody allen
documentary
called allen vs pharaoh come out
coming out on sunday and then it goes me
and says it goes beyond the scandalous
headlines and makes an argument that
uh that woody allen got away with the
unthinkable
um in a number of ways so
i think they mean unthinkable
child sexual accusations or something
i'm not exactly
sure the details of it but here's what i
would say about this
do you remember i was talking about the
four steps for
recognizing fake news from mr caulfield
and he warned you don't do a deep dive
on one topic if you watch this
documentary
this will be the thing he warned you not
to do
if you watch this documentary which
apparently its point of view is that
woody allen is guilty of unthinkable
acts
will you come away believing it was true
yes you will because if you do a deep
dive
you're going to be sort of living in it
and
you won't see any counterpoints you will
only see what the documentary
wants you to see and you will believe
that woody allen is a monster
is he how would i know how would i know
right i mean he's been accused of some
bad stuff
i wasn't there but i do know the
murray gilman amnesia theory
which says that if you're watching news
that
you personally know the truth of let's
say it's news about you
and you personally know what's true and
what isn't which is rare
you know that the news is fake but as
soon as it's about something you don't
have personal knowledge of you imagine
it might be true
there's no reason to believe that now
here's a caution i give you if you
really want to screw with your own brain
go google the two recent documentaries
about michael jackson
one one documentary shows two accusers
who are very credible saying that he did
horrible things with them when they were
children and if you do a deep dive on
that
and spend the the length of the
documentary looking at that
you will walk away thinking that could
not be untrue
i mean that's really really convincing
really convincing
and that's certainly the experience i
had i watched that thing and i said you
know
that that puts the rest all doubts like
if anybody thought maybe
michael jackson wasn't doing terrible
things
you just watch that documentary it's
pretty obvious
when you listen to these witnesses they
look very credible
lots of details and then
google uh i don't know the name of it
but there's a
there's a second documentary that came
out soon after that
which debunked the first documentary
perfectly meaning that if you did a deep
dive on the debunk
you would never believe the first one
again because the debunk is
it's as strong as the accusation but if
you'd only seen the debunk or you'd only
seen the accusation
you would go down that well and you
would stay there
if you've only seen one of them you
would be completely sold
because they're both that good but
they're opposite truths
one is really compelling that none of
this happened and it can all be
explained in
documented easy obvious ways that it
didn't happen
and the other one is just as convincing
that it definitely happened
now you watch this woody helen movie
this
is by analogy it's very similar to the
first
michael jackson movie you watch this
thing and i haven't seen it of course
but i guarantee you that if you watch
this documentary that comes out sunday
you will be convinced that woody allen
is a monster
don't be now i'm not saying he's not
and it's not my job to defend him or
anybody else
personally i have no knowledge of
anything that woody allen did or did not
do
i know what he's accused of i know what
it sounds like
i just live in a world where stuff about
celebrities and in a minor way i'm part
of that world
is so often untrue that it would be
ridiculous to believe it
because of the just the math of it
things like that are
usually untrue most of the time
i don't know that that's the case in
this case i have no reason to believe
it's untrue
but i also have no reason to believe
it's true and i would
caution you that as that this advice
about
going sideways and looking for a little
bit from another source that might doubt
your source
is way more useful than going all the
way down the well
and having no other well to double check
it
so be careful now given that
what do you think about the fact that
this documentary exists
because it's either a great service to
the world
maybe or it's complete
because one of those two michael jackson
documentaries
i don't know which one one of them's
 and it looks pretty darn
compelling
they both do so
i would not believe anything about the
woody allen story
i wouldn't believe anything i wouldn't
believe he's innocent
i don't think i have any reason to
to have that judgment but i also
wouldn't believe that any of the
specific claims
are necessarily true you just we don't
live in a world in which you could trust
any of this not any of it so
and somebody's saying that one option is
that they're both
yeah you can't rule out the fact that
the truth is somewhere in between or on
the side or
somewhere completely else so i will
recommend
the following when you're trying to sort
out your fake news make sure that
all the sources reported the same or
it's probably not true
uh you should listen to people like matt
tabi people like tim poole
people people like mike cernovich
people like uh jack passovic people who
can
tell you something's true or not and at
the very least
they're not lying right they could be
wrong
have you ever seen me be wrong about
something of course if you've been
watching me for a while you've seen me
be wrong
but i've never lied to you
how would you know right how would you
know yeah
glenn glenn greenwald
has a long long history of being able to
be on any side of a topic
where the wherever the data takes him
so he he's proven he can do that so you
should
listen him uh jonathan turley yes
um alan dershowitz i would say alan
dershowitz
can be on either side of an issue he
will actually follow
um follow the news now and you can see
some other ones yeah the no agenda
no agenda podcast i would say that would
be another
excellent example jordan peterson
another good example
he doesn't do politics as much
but that would be a good example seeing
some other um
michael malus is sort of a a special
case i'll agree that he'll go wherever
the
the the facts take him but because his
online persona is uh
you're designed to be entertaining
that's a special case um
naval doesn't talk politics
so that that's a decision on his part he
doesn't wanna
he just doesn't talk politics so um
if you want to learn how to be
successful and have a good life and be
happy
follow naval ravikant if you want to
know politics
that would be someone else
yeah you know somebody's putting ben
shapiro on the list so here's the thing
i don't know of any personally i don't
know if any examples where ben shapiro
has ever taken a side
that would be maybe more associated with
the left
if he's done it let me know but i'm not
aware of it i don't believe
that ben shapiro has ever lied to his
audience that i know of
i don't think so because it doesn't look
like there's any intention to do that
there's no reason to do that
he doesn't need to doesn't make him more
money to do that like i just don't think
that has anything to do with any of his
motivation so i would say that
um ben shapiro would be a good example
of somebody who would be
you could trust to be honest but
i think that his audience locks him a
little bit into a
conservative position i'm not sure that
you're going to see somebody crossing
over as much
but he'll always be honest within the
position that he takes
um michael knowles i love his show but i
haven't watched
enough of them to to have the full
context but he's
he puts on a great show um
somebody said in the comments my wife
says everyone lies
i think it's true that everyone lies but
maybe about different topics
right so there's probably something
that anybody would lie about
you're more likely to lie about
themselves
uh but if you don't have a reason to lie
about the other side
that's good um
somebody's saying uh tucker carlson
tucker carlson
is an example of someone who has a long
history
of being able to take a side that the
data suggests yeah he does have a
history of that
that would be a good now but
i would give you a question any anybody
who's appearing
on a network or entity that has a real
clear audience preference you know
meaning they're
they're left or the right they're going
to have an extra pressure
to be compatible with their team so
um i would prefer the you know
the tybee timpool even me
because we're sort of doing our own
thing we don't have the pressure of the
other people telling us what to do
uh yeah cheryl atkinson another good
name greg guffeld
greg gutfeld a long history of being
able to
you know go with the what makes sense
and not where the
politics necessarily are
all right um dave rubin
perfect example yes dave reuben
you know he can be on the left he can be
on the right he just follows what makes
sense
it's rare uh joe rogan yes
bill moore is interesting i i have real
uh i have mixed feelings about bill
moore i think bill maher suffered from
tds
like a lot of people did uh but if you
took away that
if if the only thing you you know you
dinged
bill maher for is a little bit too much
tds if you take that out
he's he's pretty brave about being
willing to go
wherever his opinion and the facts lead
him
so i'll give him that and and i would
say that bill maher is
even if you hate him like even if you
hate his show
you disagree with him he's he's very
i don't know he's he's on the border of
that national treasure
kind of category like maybe it's too
soon
but you know someday i think people are
going to say of bill maher
they was one of the most valuable voices
in america
i think and only because of how brave he
is
about the way he talks about certain
topics so i think the bravery of it
and the the freedom of his that
that that gave him was valuable to the
country i think that that's
i think he's a service to the country
honestly i do
oh i just got andy nose book i was going
to hold that up
but i'll bring that upstairs in a minute
geraldo somebody says
uh geraldo same thing i have a
tremendous
respect for geraldo uh even
even when i don't agree with him
sometimes but i have tremendous respect
for him because he also can
fearlessly go left or right wherever the
data takes them
it's just kind of rare so and we we
probably just mentioned
80 of all the people who can do that who
are talking about politics and whose
names you would recognize
so we that's probably about it all right
that's all i got for today slow news day
and
i will go uh do something else now and i
hope that you go off
and have a great day
i know you will oh i know you will
take care
all right all you youtube people i just
turned off periscope
um i understand that there's a little
button that you're looking at called
subscribe and i hate it when the host at
the beginning of
any kind of a live stream or show they
go into their commercial first
is that the worst you turn it on you
want to be entertained and they
they start giving you their housekeeping
and if you hit the subscribe button blah
blah
but let's all throw it on the end so
anybody who wanted
the entertainment only can bail out but
it does help
this live stream if you hit the
subscribe button so that you'll be
notified
and uh that will keep my voice
active so right now my uh numbers and
follower
well actually the followers might be up
but i think the
monetization just fell through the roof
i don't know what's up with that but
there are forces that want to
you know lessen voices like mine and
if you subscribe it gives me a little
more a little more weight
in the market so
please do that if you are inclined and
that is all i have for you today
and i will talk to you
