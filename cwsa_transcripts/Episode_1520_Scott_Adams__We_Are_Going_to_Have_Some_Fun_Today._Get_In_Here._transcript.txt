well good morning everybody it's time
for
the best part of the day
the part
that makes everybody happier everybody
richer everybody a little better looking
yeah have you noticed that people who
watch coffee with scott adams
they're a little bit sexier than other
people aren't they yeah they are you
know they are you know it
you can see them on the streets
you'd be walking down the street maybe a
whole crowd of people
you look at the crowd of people and
you'll say ordinary ordinary
ordinary
and then you'll see somebody
who watches the simultaneous sip you
won't even know it
they'll be complete strangers
but they're almost
glowing
almost like you could see your aura
yeah no it's true
you just look for it you'll start to see
it
yeah those who who come here early and
enjoy the simultaneous if you have a big
advantage in life over those who don't
and if you'd like to take it up to
another level
almost to the level of unfair
all you need is a copper mug or glass a
tiger chelsea's tainack canteen jugger
flask
a vessel
of what kind any kind
fill it with your maid
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
yeah it's called the simultaneous sip
and watch it do its thing go
now some of you can drink tea and
pretend it's coffee that's fine too
yeah let's go brandon let's go
brad
well rasmussen
did a poll ask people if people are more
divided after biden or less divided
now thank goodness
thank goodness
we got president biden to
bring the country together
dare i say unite us
yes
and uh how's he doing
first year on the job joe biden has
well according to the rasmussen poll
sixty-four percent of uh
people polled said we're more divided
hmm
that's not good
uh but eleven percent said we're more
united
so eleven percent
working out great
um
43 said trump would make it even worse
so
according to this poll
i may be reading too much into it but i
believe
that we've shown that every president no
matter who they are makes everything
worse
sort of a zeno's paradox
kind of a situation
every president no matter who it is
it just just makes things 50 worse
forever
wherever you are and whoever the next
president is i'm sorry it's going to be
50 worse than what it was
so i'm not sure that this is the kind
poll that's telling us
uh much more than how people want
you to know they answered the question
basically um
because i don't know that you can
measure how divided we are
is that even a thing
can you can you even measure that how
divided we are
kind of
subjective you all know facebook had a
major outage
yesterday that reportedly cost mark
zuckerberg seven billion dollars
seven billion dollars
uh
five percent of his wealth
and do you think he noticed
uh he probably had to borrow money for
lunch but did he really lose seven
billion dollars no no um
no
on paper or something went down it'll go
back up next week so he didn't lose
anything
[Music]
there's something in this story
that is hilarious
how many know how many of you know the
hilarious part of the facebook
outage story so they were out for hours
and it cost them uh they lost 160
million dollars of revenue and it was a
pretty big deal but how many of you know
the funny part of it
well okay you're close somebody's saying
it's an upgrade no there's something
funnier
there's something funnier about the
story and we don't we don't know the
details yet but there's something very
funny about it
you ready
let me just read this sentence i think
this came from cnn
the exact cause of the outage has not
been confirmed by facebook
but one expert said the problem may have
been caused by an internal error made by
staff
that effectively erased the site from
the internet
how do you erase the site from the
internet
you do it this way
uh john graham cunningham
the cto of web security firm cloud chair
said facebook made a series of updates
to its border gateway protocol which
caused it to quote disappear from the
internet
okay now maybe it's because i'm the
dilbert cartoonist and i can see a whole
month of material
coming but
but here's the funny part
in all likelihood
there's one employee somewhere
who knows they did this
somewhere
somewhere in this you know seven
seven of 700 some billion people
there's one poor bastard who knows he
pushed the wrong button and made
made facebook disappear from the
internet
trying to think of this this poor guy's
a performance review
in a few months
sitting down with this boss
how'd your quarter go
so
what did you accomplish this quarter
well
we
we we've been seeing a lot of bad
publicity
we've been seeing a lot of bad publicity
about
how facebook is
destroying youth and
hurting people and
hurting people's self-esteem and it's
causing a lot of damage
but i stopped that
so here's the irony
whoever it is or
whoever it is who pushed the wrong
button and erased facebook from the
internet
whoever did that
did more good for the
world than any politician except maybe
rand paul
from last year
it's the only good thing that anybody's
ever done at facebook
and he's gonna get fired for it
well if you couldn't tell i finally got
enough good sleep last
[Laughter]
night i just love this story
all right
now let's move on
uh so the three
the 3.5 trillion dollar infrastructure
bill how do you think that's doing
how's that doing
everybody think that's gonna slide right
through
you know it's free
it's 3.5 trillion dollars but
that sounds like a lot but you got to
spread it over 10 years
and then you have to
then you have to
you have to appreciate that not only is
it spread over 10 years so not nearly as
bad
but
uh
but it's free
according to biden it pays for itself so
if it's free
why can't you get that improved
but mansion and cinema the two senators
are holding tight
and uh
who besides me predicted that this would
never get assigned
do you remember
give me a give me a fact check in case
there's anybody wonders if i'm just
making this up
so in the comments can you verify
that i've been saying for a long time
that this thing isn't going to get
assigned
you can verify that has anybody else
said that
as anybody else who's let's say a
prominent pundit just said this isn't
going to get signed this is never going
to happen
now i don't know if it'll get negotiated
down to a trillion or something
so uh
democrats would you like some advice
this is free advice for democrats
you ready here's how to get their
infrastructure bill passed
not the full 3.5 trillion all right
they're not going to get that passed
but how to get something
something passed
let me ask you this question and maybe
you know the answer
of the 3.5 trillion in infrastructure
how much of the 3.5 trillion
goes toward fixing our election systems
such that they could be
audited instantly and we wouldn't have
any questions about whether it was a
fair election
how much of the 3.5
trillion dollars
goes to our most important
infrastructure
oh yeah i said it our most important
infrastructure
what's more important
your potholes
or your republic
which is a higher priority
infrastructure
it's not even close right
it's not even close
so here's what
the democrats could do to make their
infrastructure bill a little more
palatable
a little more palatable
put in a big part that fixes the most
important infrastructure
how about that
let's let's put some money in there to
fix the most important infrastructure of
the elections because everything else is
subsidiary to that
now that's not going to get you all
three 3.5 trillion the republicans
aren't going to go for that but
do you think he could get some
republicans on board
for a trillion
plus election reform
one trillion plus election reform
who's against election
improvements
does that
well i mean in public you can't say
you're against it even if you are
all right that's my suggestion to fix
that thing by putting the election stuff
in there and hold tight i wouldn't say
anything
let me say this again to republicans
don't sign anything that doesn't have
election
reform in it
as part of the infrastructure
don't say anything don't fix a road
don't give anybody wi-fi don't do
anything
election reform number one priority
get that in there and then you can
negotiate but if that's not in there
don't even negotiate
there's nothing to talk about you can't
have an infrastructure bill that ignores
the most important infrastructure
right i mean that's just stupid
there are some things you could say
are well i'm philosophically opposed or
i don't like this much socialism and
those are sort of
you know fair
fair kinds of arguments
but it's not a philosophical debate to
say that we have
skepticism in this country about the
election integrity
i mean nobody would argue that there is
skepticism
and that that needs to get fixed to have
a healthy republic
those are
not really arguable points so i would
say that an infrastructure bill that
doesn't have
fixing the most important infrastructure
in it
is just stupid
so stop calling it you know whatever it
is different priorities right it's just
stupid
put the infrastructure in the
infrastructure building maybe you got a
chance
all right
um
there's a black ex-tesla worker
who won a court case he claimed he was
uh racially abused every day at a
california plant
including being called the n-word and he
was awarded
137 million dollars
now when you read that headline if you
did or maybe you're hearing it for the
first time
did you now say to yourself
this looks a little exaggerated
meaning that the size of the award seems
crazy
you know and of enersize with the crime
but also i mean really really this guy
was abused every day
every day
really every day he got racially abused
and then so you know i'm totally
skeptical read the headline and like oh
god it's one of these stories of you
know
somebody couldn't take a joke or
something like that and then i read the
actual claims
are you ready for this
these are the things that apparently the
court found credible
right so a court found these claims
credible
here's here's what he claimed
um i think this was from
was it from fox news i forget
uh the 52 year old he was a contracted
elevator operator he claimed that fellow
employees drew swastikas
and left racist graffiti around the
plant
while he said one of his supervisors
drew a person with a black face
and a bone in his hair
and wrote boo
short for a
the supervisor then allegedly told him
he quote
couldn't take a joke
uh when diaz confronted him
uh
diaz contended that none of his
supervisors stepped in to stop the abuse
is any that true
i mean it sounds like it passed the test
for the
the uh
the jury
but
i have been have any of you ever been in
any kind of environment like this
because i've never been anywhere near
anything like this
you know i live in california this this
factory's
you know just down the road
and
why could i live here all my adult life
i've never been anywhere near
never we're never anywhere near any kind
of behavior like this
have you
i'm just looking at your comments to see
if any of you have ever been near this
kind of behavior
i'm not seeing any yeses
oh so i saw yes
i saw some more yeses
i saw another yes
i'm seeing some yeses
somebody said no and i've worked in lots
of blue collar that's sort of what i was
looking for
somebody says no and they've been to the
deep south
i don't know
this is shocking
and i'm seeing yeses so that
all of you who
said no you had the same experience i
have apparently
just be aware
there are people who are probably
credible
who are saying yes
that this is real
it's a little wake-up call isn't it
that you know you think things are good
but you're thinking in terms of the
average
right on average things are pretty good
relative to where they used to be right
lots of improvement needed
but man you see something like this and
you say if any of this is even close to
true
it
does kind of shock me
i am a little bit shocked
so in that case the 137 million is fine
yeah but
if the claims are true
suddenly the amount of money doesn't
look so high anymore does it because
yeah the reason is punitive it's not
about rewarding this guy it's just
punitive
all right
cnn has turned on facebook which is
interesting in itself because you know
you would imagine them both
being left-leaning organizations
but in a uh opinion piece by cara
alaimo a la aliamo
i wish people had
some way for me to pronounce their names
correctly
so here's what she said in an opinion
piece on cnn and the fact that it's on
cnn seems important right
she said thus the debate we should be
having isn't about whether facebook
knows its product is harmful
these facts were established by
independent researchers long ago
so a cnn opinion piece is offering as a
established fact that even facebook
would agree to
the independent researchers say that
facebook is
harmful
just a statement it's just harmful
and so she says rather the question we
should be asking ourselves is why
americans are spent still spending so
much time
of their lives on it when it's making
them unhappy and divided
so we know that facebook is harmful
why are people spending so much time on
it
now again the big story here is just
that facebook is reporting it or not
reporting about putting this opinion
piece on their site
so
you know the left is fractured not only
the progressives versus the you know the
pelosi types
but even the the facebooks versus the
cnns now not really on the same side
anymore so when rasmus into that poll
are we more or less divided
interestingly we're more fractured
i don't know that we're more divided but
we're more fractured does that make
sense instead of two teams
it's more like you know four or six
teams or something different
so i don't know if that's more divided
or more fractured
or is that the same thing
but of course the real reason that we
use facebook so much is that many of us
can't avoid it you know you need it for
business
and
it's addictive it's designed to be
addictive so of course it's harmful and
of course we do it
yeah same as cigarettes
same as any other addiction why do we
treat internet addiction different than
um
say heroin addiction why do we treat
them differently
you know they're not the same of course
but um feels like the concept is similar
you know i'm not entirely sure that
instagram in particular will survive
at least in his current form
i think instagram in particular seems
like the dane the more dangerous one
frankly
so we'll see
new york teachers protested many of them
and they were shouting f joe biden and
f bill de blasio
so thousands of teachers lost their job
because of the vaccine mandate
but let's put some context on this
does everybody like context
i had some people arguing against
context today
our argument was that if i asked for
context i
i was trying to brainwash them
or try to convince them of something bad
to which i say
hmm
i don't know a situation in which
context makes things worse
is there one
if you're trying to accurately
understand the situation
is there a situation where context makes
it worse
there are actually people pushing and
pushing back
because i asked for context i'll tell
you why in a second right so the context
i asked for is
are there any other mandatory
vaccinations that teachers also need to
have
was that a fair question
is it a fair
question for context
to know if there are other vaccinations
that are required of the teachers
now the critics said scott's got scott
this is so unfair you're just trying to
get people vaccinated that's your real
your real agenda
is to embarrass these people and get
people vaccinated
no
no
you can't read my mind and that's not my
secret agenda i really don't care if
people get vaccinated as long as i am
right i care about myself
but
here's what the context told me first of
all do you know the answer to the
question in the comments
give me your answer because i don't
think anybody
has really looked into it too deeply but
are there other vaccinations that
teachers in the united states that might
differ by state uh that are they're
required to have
i'm seeing some people say plenty
say yes is
the answer is sort of no
the answer is sort of no meaning there's
nothing that's enforced
right so based on the answers that i got
my current understanding which i might
revise if i get some new information but
it looks like
there's some mild
preferences in some places but nobody's
really checking i don't think any
teacher ever lost a job before now
for a lack of vaccination is that true
is there any teacher who ever couldn't
get hired or lost a job
for a different kind of vaccination
recently
i don't think that's the thing right so
here's your context
required forced vaccinations of teachers
it's not a thing
so if it's a thing now it's a thing for
the first time right
so i think and i think there there's
still a little bit disagreement on fact
so i think you'll find that in some
places it looks like it's a requirement
but it's not enforced so in effect it's
not
this is enforced
yeah
so when i ask for context this is what
people said scott you bastard
you're trying to make this vaccination
like the others and you know they're not
the same
damn it you know they're not the same
because this one was you know a faster
pace and it didn't have as much time so
we don't know the safety it's a
different technology scott you bastard
stop saying that this vaccination is in
any way in any way
equivalent similar to
or we should make any decisions based on
what the other vaccinations did they're
just different
true
can i agree with you
am i allowed to agree with my critics of
course they're different
this is why i say don't use analogies to
make decisions
because it's just a different thing
but
can context ever be useful
what did the context tell me
once people said no there's no other
sample no other example where it's been
yeah old fool the old tool
there's no other example where
we've required vaccinations
so
did my context
support the idea you should get
vaccinated or the teachers should or did
the context
support the idea that they shouldn't
this supports the idea that they
shouldn't because it's a new precedent
so if you look at the old precedent it's
like we were pretty laissez-faire
sort of sort of let it go
so this is different
and i think that's worth noting
because if this was in any way similar
to the past you'd feel different about
it
right
then if you knew well this is brand new
whoa whoa this is brand new
so when i asked for the context i didn't
ask for the context because it would
help my argument which i don't have
because i don't have an argument you're
imagining that i'm trying to persuade
you and i'm not i'm just trying to
understand it
so the context when exactly the opposite
of the way that my critics thought it
would
you thought that when i asked for the
context it was going to support the idea
they should get vaccinated it didn't
it was the opposite
that's why you asked for context
you asked for context because you don't
know which way it's going to point
and by the way context doesn't
answer the story because again they're
different they're different vaccinations
so you can't take the context and just
say okay
now we know the context
we're all done it doesn't work like that
but it's part of the larger story right
it's part of how we feel about it as
part of
um
you know what we've accepted in the past
is part of the story
so let's know about it
so i would say that the context does
support
the teachers not getting vaccinated
doesn't mean that's the right answer
doesn't mean it's the right answer but
the context would support that
all right um
let's see what else we got going uh
playboy made some news by putting a man
on the cover
uh a male cover star
dressed as a bunny
i'm not sure what the guy's deal was if
he was
i don't know what his sexual
identification was but it was a male
dressed in a bunny outfit
uh
now what do you think of that as a
strategy is that a good strategy for
playboy
most of you say it's stupid right i
think almost every person here is going
to say that's dumb they've destroyed
their brand
let me give you the counter argument
okay because you think there's no
counter argument
you probably think there's no
way this is smart for playboy right
all right here's the counter argument
it's pretty good
i think you'll be surprised how good the
counter argument is
number one
could playboy stay in business by
continuing to print
nude pictures
of women
no
so couldn't can we all agree with this
that the internet
makes it ridiculous to imagine that
playboy could exist
as a magazine that's primary purpose is
to show naked women we all agree that
playboy could not exist
the way it was right so that's the
starting point they had to change
now how could they change
one way they could change is by trying
to
be more provocative than the internet
is that possible
could playboy be more
sexy than the internet can can they get
some attention by being as sexy as the
internet meaning as much x-rated stuff
etc no no there's nowhere there's no
niche there there's no place to go
so agree with me first
the playboy as a vehicle for showing
pictures of naked women was dead
you know it might have had a few months
left but it was dead
okay so take for you take for the
assumption that it was they were dead so
they had to do something here's my
argument
playboy has always been at least three
magazines in one
people don't realize it because you you
think about the nudity
but the other parts of playboy was it
was a lifestyle magazine
and it was a lifestyle of people very
open-minded you know the people who
who had
just extreme open-mindedness about
progressive anything
so playboy was always the ultimate
left-leaning socially progressive
vehicle in addition
to having naked pictures
the third thing they were was fairly
serious
the playboy interview
was usually a big thing you know jimmy
carter was in the playboy interview
a lot of a lot of
you know news was broken with the
playboy interviews so the playboy
interview was almost its own magazine it
was within this naked people magazine
but it was like its own entity
by the way i was i was once the subject
of the playboy
um interview years ago when dilbert was
a bigger deal
and i'll i've have to tell you that the
playboy
journalist and the way they handled it
and the fact checking
was one of the finest
journalistic experiences i've had
like legitimately journalistically
high quality
was playboy
right now most people you don't think of
that you don't think of playboy as being
a high-level journalistic
entity but it is it always has been well
i'm not sure about currently but it
always has been
so they had to change and they couldn't
give more nudity but it was always a
magazine about progressive stuff and
about pushing the boundaries and about
political stuff
i think this was a hail mary pass
meaning that playboy has to turn into
something else to survive there's no
question about that
and the only thing they could turn into
was something closer to the other two
things that they did besides nudity and
the other two things they did was get
your attention
and be relevant about you know socially
provocative
things that are there on the edge
will it work
i wouldn't bet on it
but did they have a better play
right
did playboy
have a better play
i don't think so
i think this was the best of their bad
options and
they executed it really well
they executed this
really well why because we're talking
about it
we're talking about it suddenly
playboy became relevant
the moment it pissed you off
as soon as you were mad about that cover
what's happening with all of my
traditions and all that as soon as you
got mad about it and thought they were
killing themselves and you know you get
all whatever you thought about it it
worked
so playboy
succeeded
they succeeded in pushing themselves
right into the front of a
very
let's say energy-filled
discussion about you know gender and
sexuality and stuff and they became
relevant
by making you a little bit angry or
disturbed or whatever it did to you so
that's my argument my argument is not
that it will work
but it was their best play and they
executed it well
disagreements in the comments
disagree
i think i sold you on that
it looks like i sold you on that okay
let's talk about uh china
you remember uh i gave trump credit as
many did
for negotiating trade deal with china
and pushing hard and you know there was
all that
trade war and stuff but at least he got
a good deal out of it and china was
going to buy a bunch of our farm goods
etc
and then they just didn't
that that's what happens when you make a
deal with china
you make a deal and then they just
don't do their part
why i don't know does it matter
i'm sure they would have found some
reason to not do it
they just didn't do it
so now biden's going to push back
so do we give trump a win for
negotiating a trade deal well
maybe only in the sense that it exposed
china for what it is
so you had you had to at least make them
agree to a deal
and then whether they
whether they lived up to the deal is a
second question
but i think trump's instinct to get them
to agree to a deal was right
and now we can observe that we can't
deal with them because they just didn't
keep their deal now i'm sure if we talk
to china they'd have a different opinion
of what's going on here probably would
say we didn't do our part of the deal so
maybe part of this story is missing if
we're being fair there's probably
something missing in the story
but
we certainly
didn't get a good outcome
now
this again um
plays into the uh the notion here that
china is very unsafe for business not
just
commercial business but also
political deals they they can't they
won't keep a deal
if china won't keep a deal
you just can't deal with them you can't
deal with them politically you can't
deal with them commercially
they are unsafe
for business
we also have some reports
also in
cnn
about some whistleblowers or i guess
some people who came out of
the china system
one uyghur and one police officer who
apparently was ordered to torture them
and i guess the way that the uyghurs are
picked up is that they literally put a
black hood over their heads
and they take them away
and they beat them until they
confess to things that they're not
guilty of
and this is men and women
and all of the suspects apparently get
raped
men and women
let me say that again
there's some suggestion now of course we
don't know if the reporting is correct
right
i mean this is the sort of thing you
would expect people to lie about
so let me say this
the reason that we attacked iraq and the
weapons of mass destruction we thought
were there is that somebody had a reason
to lie
to get us to attack iraq right
so when you see a story like this you
gotta say historically these
whistleblowers
uh of this type
are lying
historically
this kind of story would not be true
anybody disagree with that
would you say that historically
the whistleblower says you know we get
tortured every day is usually not true
now that doesn't mean there's no torture
i'm sure there is
but don't you think it's a little bit of
hyperbole
a little bit
because this person has a great
incentive to make it sound worse than it
is now however bad it is it's
it's a 10 and a 10.
but
the whistleblower is going to make it
sound like a 15 right so let me not
minimize it on a scale of 1 to 10 it's a
10.
it's a 10.
but the whistleblower is going to make
it look like a 15. right that would be
normal to what you expect so just keep
that in mind that there you know there's
an incentive to
at least shade things a little bit but
the story so far is that the police use
electric batons on the uyghurs they put
a black hood on them when they pick them
up in the street they take them back
they beat them badly and often
and often
and then one of the men
reported that
the guards forced the other prisoners to
uh to rape him
gang rape them apparently
and that that was normal
now
i don't know about that last part
i'm going to say that the last part
the guy saying it sounded credible and
if it did happen it's horrible
etc i don't know if i could go that far
but whatever it is is a 10 and a 10. so
bad stuff's happening there
um
and again
china
is unsafe for business now i did get a
lengthy message from one of my contacts
on linkedin
and if you're watching right now i won't
mention your name but
uh that my context is lacking on china
for example
here's the counter argument
that china's aggressiveness in the
south china sea
is actually mostly defensive
because they're putting up a defense
against the you know i don't know the
u.s fifth fleet or something
because they don't want to be uh
um they don't ever want to be locked
into their own territory where they
can't do trade and indeed having the
belton road initiative would give them
you know some diversification of
of commercial outlets
so they wouldn't need exclusively the
ocean and they'd have an option etc do
you believe any of that
to me i'm not sure there's such a
difference between a defensive act and
an offensive act
i feel like that distinction is a little
bit artificial
don't you
there we go aggressive defense
yeah being aggressively defensive looks
a lot like offensiveness
and we certainly know that the
chinese government has some ambitions
about controlling as much of the world
as they can
same as we do
right
every superpower wants to control as
much as they can
why wouldn't you i mean so do you don't
you want to control as much of your life
as you can
so it's pretty natural that china would
be trying to control as much as they can
but do they have a defensive incentive
too sure
now apparently also the the flyovers
over taiwan
were i think key to some holiday or
something but that doesn't really
that doesn't make it better
so
just be aware that there is a
there's one point of view that china's
actions are a little bit more defensive
than they look
but i'm not buying
i i definitely think that they have a
defensive
uh motivation as everyone does
but i feel like all of their defense has
a offensive
secondary purpose
so that's what it looks like and they
should i mean that would that would be
the rational thing to do
why would why would you have something
that's purely defensive when it could be
both
right
um
here's a
question for you that's kind of weird so
on twitter twitter user christopher hill
noticed this and
i guess others noticed it too but did
you know that biden's build back better
slogan
is being used in canada and great
britain
did you know that
that i guess boris johnson uses it
and
trudeau uses it in canada
they all use buildback better
that's uh
what's that telling you
i've never seen that happen before have
you because it feels like it would be so
obvious that you're you know cribbing
somebody's slogan that you wouldn't do
it
pelosi called it obama's buildback
better
yeah it's a new world order slogan
so
uh yeah i'm not so much into the new
world order uh conspiracy stuff
but
it is a weird coincidence
that it doesn't have an explanation that
i can think of because it isn't so
clever
is it
now i will give it one
one benefit
and i don't think it's like does this
does it feel like the public is saying
build back better the same way they were
saying mega and make america great again
the genius of
trump's slogan making is that people
would repeat it
because they liked it
have you ever heard a democrat who
proudly says build back better i mean
except for the professional politicians
do you see it on twitter
do you see a lot of just biden
supporters
saying build back better
not really right
it's i don't know how the slogan became
so popular when the public doesn't care
about it at all it's only the
politicians so there's something weird
going on there we just don't know what
it is
um adam dopamine
that's not his real name on twitter
asks
why are
passenger planes not spreading covet
so you pack all these people in the
passenger plane
and we know of course now that just
being vaccinated
isn't enough to prevent
covert spread
why are airplanes not being grounded
why are we not hearing stories about
well yeah we gotta fly but yeah i have
to admit
getting a lot of infections you know we
don't want to close the airlines
even though we're getting a lot of
infections
i think it's not happening right
it's just not happening
so the first question is is it because
of the the filters the airflow airplanes
are are sensationally well designed in
terms of airflow they have to be
but here's my counterpoint i tweeted it
and then i untweeted it after i thought
for a second here's why i untweeted it
how many infections are we getting from
buses
right how many infections do we get from
subways
about
cars
i feel like it's
sort of none right
ubers yeah ubers
how many ubers are giving people gold
what is going on elevators right now
elevators you're not in there for very
long so that maybe that makes more sense
but i feel as if
we really don't know how this stuff
spreads still
am i wrong
because we should know exactly where
people are getting it by now because
people can kind of you know
they can put together you know where
they were and who got it in enough cases
not every case but enough cases you know
where you got it
that we should know by now where people
are getting it why do you think you
don't know that
why do you think you as a member of the
public was really paying attention
because it matters to your daily life
you're really paying attention
you don't know
as of right now given the vaccination
status of the country you don't know
where people are getting it do you
why not
it's got to be available right
there's some somehow somebody's studying
this
somebody is studying people with covet
and saying okay if you know
where you're infected what's your best
guess
we kind of know that by now don't we
and whatever it was before vaccinations
it might be different now
it could be that the place we get it now
is a different way a different place
let me give you a provocative thought
is it a sexually transmitted disease now
think about it
if you if you're not getting it on the
plane
and you're not getting in the classroom
you're not getting it at work and i
don't know if that's true because we
have a lack of data right
where are people getting it
sex
because i feel like if you've got if
you're vaccinated
you've got a slobber all over somebody
to give it to them don't you i'm just
speculating all right nothing i say now
should be taken as any kind of a fact
right
but i wonder if we get to the point
let's say just about everybody gets
vaccinated let's say we get to 90
percent
and let's say that the vaccination
reduces the amount of viral load
so that the so that you don't give it to
people so much just by talking or just
by being in the room
how would you give it to people if it's
a lower viral load
and they're vaccinated too
you pretty pretty much have to stick
your tongue down the throat
am i wrong
now i'm exaggerating right i'm
exaggerating for
for effect
but are we reaching a point where the
only way this thing is going to spread
in any meaningful way
is you've got to climb on top of another
human and breathe in their mouth
again exaggerating a little bit but i
feel like it's becoming a sexually
transmitted disease and it might be
mostly transmitted by people having
affairs
yeah see where i went there it might be
mostly trans at some point and maybe
we're approaching it
at some point if you get enough people
vaccinated
it's mostly going to come from sex
because that's the only time you're
getting that close for that long
right am i wrong am i wrong that this
could morph into a sexually transmitted
disease because it's just the only way
you can get enough virus into another
vaccinated person
i'll just put that out there
all right i saw rasmussen tweeting
something from the gateway pundit and
there's a claim here that i will give a
low credibility so i don't get banned
from social media
and that's my actual opinion i think
there's low credibility to this claim
that there are
393
illegal registered voters in arizona
meaning that there's two databases that
didn't match there's a social security
numbers
didn't match the voting polls or
something like that
and there's some discrepancy of 393
people who maybe shouldn't have voted
that maybe did
is that real
is that being reported on cnn
i don't think so is it being reported on
fox news
is fox news reporting this as true
here's the way i approach this
um the gateway pundit doesn't have a
100 percent accurate record
on what the record is but
like most entities it's not 100
that's all i can say for sure i don't
know i don't know how it compares to the
new york times
for example
um
but
here's a good standard if it's not being
reported by both entities it's probably
not true
if you don't see cnn saying it and also
fox news saying yeah we do have this
discrepancy
maybe one would say why and the other
wouldn't but
probably not something to worry about
probably just a database problem
so also i'll say that's not confirmed
i mean it's certainly a red flag and
certainly we should know why there's a
difference but probably just a database
difference probably not
any any
any bad thing found
a vaccinated person who develops
symptoms is just as contagious as a
non-vax
true for for a shorter amount of time
so once you add on top of that that true
statement
that a vaccinated person who just got
the vaccination can give off a lot of
virus but not for long
so they're they're contagious
they're that contagious for a short time
i think
check on that do a fact check on that
okay
i'm not positive
um i was asked if i'm getting the
booster my answer to that is the same as
my answer to the original vaccination
question
since i got the regular vaccination as
late as possible
so that i could have the benefit of as
many months of other people getting it
as possible
i'm also going to wait as long as
possible for the booster
so i have as much information about
other people's experiences as possible
so the answer is i haven't decided
and i shouldn't
until the last minute the only time to
decide this is the last minute
deciding ahead of time
dumb
is dumb
now yeah i suppose if you had some
profession that required it you might
decide to have time
but if you if you have the uh
you know the luxury of being able to
you know self-quarantine and still work
as i do
um i'll wait till last minute
all
right um
the uh
french catholic church
discovered that there were at least 3
000 pedophiles who have been working
within the ranks of the french catholic
church
since the 50s
they estimate that as many as three
hundred and thirty thousand
children were victims since the fifties
but on the optimistic view some say only
two hundred thousand
that's the optimistic view
now
how many is that that is 3 000 and i've
rounded 115 000 priests that's a lot of
priests
so 3 000 is not a lot out of 115 000. i
don't even know if that's higher than
the you know the average in the public
feels like it is but i don't know that
it is
i feel like
i feel like somehow this needs to get
fixed
let me give you
the hypnotist view of this situation
the hypnotist says
that over time
every shoe salesman should be a man with
a shoe fetish
or a foot fetish
let me say that again
over time you're not on day one but over
time
every shoe salesman
should be a man with a foot fetish
why
because they'd work for cheaper
a man with a foot fetish will take a job
as a shoe salesman for less money
he's like that's a pretty good job i
love my job i can't wait to go to work
um likewise
over time you would expect that every um
every coach of an all-female young
female team
would be sexual harassers
not on day one but over time you'd
expect all the harassers to be attracted
to the place where they can do the most
harassing
so over time you'd expect every
organization that has young people as
their
charge
and adults in charge you'd expect over
time that they would all become
pedophiles
sorry
human motivation
you can't turn off human motivation
so if you have an organization that
absolutely is going to attract
pedophiles
you need to do something about that
i don't know what the answer is but if
you know that you're attracting the
wrong people
at the boy scouts perfect example
exactly you would expect over time that
you would have more and more of the
people you don't want in those ranks
because they would be attracted and why
not
i mean from their perspective why not
all right
here's what we think we know about shots
i'll tell you what uh i think i know
so far
uh that two shots is better than one all
right give me a fact check as i go
i'm gonna stay things we think we know
is are true
two shots is better than one
i hear that we're assuming that one shot
is you know not gonna kill you
um
and again this is not necessarily your
opinion this would be the
the consensus scientific opinion we now
believe that three shots is better than
two
again i'm not saying you agree with it
i'm saying this is the consensus
we believe that natural immunity is
better than two shots
not quite sure about that
but we do know that natural immunity
gives you immunity to sort of every part
inside and out of the virus
whereas the shots
give you a very specific immunity
i'm probably doing a bad job of
explaining this but you know they it
says spike protein that they're
targeting so they're looking at one
element
and creating a you know a vaccine around
that one element whereas natural
immunity gives you immunity to basically
all of the parts
is that better well at least one expert
said so on a on a video i saw today
so but maybe that's a question
um
so natural immunity seems better than
two shots
is natural immunity better than
three shots
probably again i'm not sure we know that
but probably because of the the
completeness of the immunity for the
natural one
uh if that matters over time i don't
know
um the consensus also is that natural
immunity plus shots
is better than either one alone
yeah how about that do you agree with
that that would be the consensus
that having the shots is good and having
natural immunity is good
uh and regardless of which one is better
it's better to have both
especially if you have the shot first
and then you get the natural immunity on
top of it because then you'll be
protected from hospitalization mostly
and then you'll get the full natural
beauty
and then
and then i think we know that both the
shot and natural immunity wane over time
but
it could be that the natural immunity
doesn't wane the same way
right we don't know that yet so that's
still a little bit open
but
it could be that natural immunity morphs
into something that can
more quickly reconstitute itself
whereas we don't know if that's true of
the shots if the shots wear off
is there any
any trace of them left that can quickly
reconstitute what was there
don't know
but that's where we're at
um andres backhouse notes that the
immunity from infections uh versus the
two shots is still uncertain
so we don't have data for that
all right um
and that
is what i wanted to say today
that is everything i wanted to say today
um
oh here's a counter point i do not agree
that uh both are better you'll have
whatever the vax got to give you uh plus
yeah so that
you get the benefits of both the natural
immunity plus the shots
but you also get whatever risks
come with both getting the vac getting
the virus
and also the risk of getting the vaccine
itself so that's true but i don't know
that that changes yours
mark says from one cartoonist to another
what do you make of ben garrison's work
as a fellow cartoonist
um brilliant
ben garrison's work as a cartoonist i
say is brilliant
why
because he found a market
and then he addressed his market
now you know it might not be your thing
if you're left-leaning or whatever but
in terms of a uh
let's see the commercial
decisions
they're right on so you found a market
you serve this market and he does it
very well very well so um
you can disagree with his point of view
that's a separate question
but as a cartoonist yeah very good very
good
um
all right that's about all i have i
gotta run and do something else and uh
thanks for
joining in
