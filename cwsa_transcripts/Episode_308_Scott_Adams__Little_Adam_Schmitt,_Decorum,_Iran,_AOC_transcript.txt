hey where is
everybody just because it's Monday
doesn't mean you don't have to come in
and watch coffee with Scott Adams and
when I say watch I mean
join because this is a very
personal uh broadcasting system doesn't
this feel more personal than other forms
of Digital
entertainment so personal that when I
have the simultaneous zp many of you
will join me and you'll notice it makes
your beverage taste better let's do it
time for the simultaneous sip grab your
mug your chalice your glass your
container fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me for the
simultaneous zp
ah well we have all kinds of things to
talk about and I know the thing you want
me to talk about the most is the new
nickname the new forever name that has
been assigned by the nicknamer in Chief
president
Trump This one belongs to Adam
Schiff if you haven't seen it already
the president has uh given him a name of
little Adam s CI TT and let
me uh look at
real I want to look at the tweet that
Adam shift did in
response
twet because it's a great
one and every every new source is
covering it
uh this could not be funnier all right I
was looking for his uh response but I
don't want to look for it
while on the it's everywhere shut
up
um so let's talk about how good a
nickname it is now first of all uh I
like the fact that it left a small doubt
very small a sliver of Doubt a barely
existing doubt about uh whether it was
just a
typo cuz T and F are not so far powered
on the
keyboard but I don't think any of us
believe it was a typo do we had it been
a typo he might have taken down the
Tweet but no it is not a typo it is the
new name for Adam
Schiff and here's the part I like best
about it
you know that sooner or later the
president is going to be talking about
Adam
Schiff uh in public and I'm waiting to
see how he pronounces it now he's not
going to pronounce it in public the
profane way so the president of the
United States even though he tweeted it
is very unlikely to say the word out
loud I would say it's possible you know
anything's possible but probably a small
you'll say it out loud what will be
funny is the way he approaches
pronouncing it all you can can you
imagine him at the rally you know his
next rally I don't know if he's going to
have any more rallies uh anytime soon
but imagine him saying and then we hear
from
representative
Adam shiff and then the Crowd Goes Wild
because when he says
shiff with an FF as in Frank
Frank he's going to say it with just a
slightly different pause just a little
bit of emphasis on the last name a
little bit of a
wink and the entire crowd is going to
hear a different
word the in the entire crowd and
everybody who sees it on TV is going to
translate it into their in their mind to
 and it's going to be freaking
hilarious they might start chanting
I don't know if there's a chant for this
yet but the president set up this
situation
where it might be the world's longest
and biggest joke with a punchline like
we're waiting for the punch line the
punch line hasn't come yet you think
that was the joke right you think the
joke was that he spelled it you know
with the TT and we're all laughing about
that oh no that's not the joke the joke
is next time he says shift in public and
the entire crowd will go nuts that's the
joke that's the punchline so personally
I can't wait if if you hear that the
president's giving any kind of a speech
and you think something might come up
about uh shiff and uh and schiff's
criticism stop what you're doing stop
what you're doing turn on the TV find a
way to watch it on the internet
you're going to have to watch him
deliver the best setup joke of all time
cuz he's just going to say the name
regular little
Adam
shiff The Crowd Goes Wild it's going to
be
epic all right here's the other biggest
story that uh is not being reported
directly so I love the stories that are
the biggest story and you can see it but
you sort of have to look for it because
the news is not packaging it up the way
I'm going to package it so I'm not going
to make I'm not going to offer any
controversial information nothing that
will fail the fact Checkers I'm just
going to describe what's happening and
then watch How It's not being packaged
the same way um by the news media so was
it only a week ago time yeah I'm losing
sense of time was it two weeks ago or
one week ago that headline news was the
president of the United
States keeps saying bad things about
black women huh huh why is it I'm sorry
I I'll need to say this in the voice of
dale dale can you come over here and
deliver this next
Point
okay why is it that the president keeps
insulting black women huh huh huh why
does he keep doing that what could
possibly be the reason Hitler what could
possibly be the reason
racist I guess it's obvious now he just
goes after black
women
scene so that was just a week ago
right what if we watched happen in the
LA in the most recent week we saw the
president go after little Adam Chef
who is not a black
woman he's neither black nor is he a
woman we saw him go after uh
mcraven who was the head of special ops
because mcraven had criticized the
president and so the critic president
criticized him back mcraven is an adult
white
male so the two latest outrages are
about the president going hard at
adult white
males at the same time he's been uh been
very nice to Jerry
Brown and to Gavin Nome who normally
would be his biggest
enemies seems like his tone has changed
he's also been quite complimentary to
Nancy Pelosi who if you did not know is
a
woman and a Democrat normally he would
not be so nice to her but he said so
much he would actually even support her
probably can work with
her he also tweeted
uncharacteristically
generously about Gillum an
African-American man who lost his race
but the president had some good things
to say about him being a a force in the
future total compliment about him
personally didn't even say anything
about his politics complimented him
personally for his character and his
Effectiveness same with Stacy Abrams
African-American woman who almost became
the first African-American Governor
which I hope we can stop saying stuff
like that someday because it should not
matter in the future but he complimented
her so in the past week what pattern has
been established oh I'm not done yet the
top news
on uh Fox News who some people say is
the
uh oops it just changed but the top news
was about the three strikes law and
showed a picture of an unfairly
imprisoned unfairly in the sense of the
stiffness of the penalties unfairly
imprisoned uh Black
Faces so very clearly pointing out that
there was some uh lack of fairness for
the African-American community and the
president is trying to fix that even at
the criticism of his own side there are
people who are conservatives who are
saying hey wait a minute that three
strike thing is actually good it's
putting people in jail who would
otherwise commit crimes the president is
taking a very
consiliary positive move that the
African-American Community should
recognize as positive now compare that
to last week the president has
obliterated last week's narrative that
he only makes he only uh
you know insults black
women meanwhile Brenda Snipes has
decided to quit her
job because she probably would have
gotten fired anyway so I think the world
is seeing that maybe she was ripe for a
little
criticism but more importantly the
pattern which the president has set this
week completely violates whatever you
were thinking was his pattern last week
is it a coincidence
well how does CNN report this complete
change of
tone from last week here's how they how
they report his complete change of tone
here's the headline the attacks and
tweets show he's not
changing so by changing
completely completely changing his
attacks from they were in fact
suspiciously weirdly about too many uh
black women but as I pointed
out the reason that black women were
coming under attack by the president is
exactly because they're so
successful everybody who was attacked by
the president had a really good job and
was just killing it with their career
these are highly
successful topend people people who have
really made a dent in the universe so to
even get on his radar you're doing
something right now at the same time
we're all talking about hey who's who's
going to run against him in
2020 um and the name that I think is
bubbling up to the top and probably will
stay there is Camala Harris now we don't
need to talk about what you think about
Kamala Harris's politics what you think
about her personal life forget that just
stop and pause for a moment and think
about this that both the Democrats and
the
Republicans believe that Kamal Kamala
Harris is the strongest candidate to
maybe become president of the United
States if you have not
noticed she is both black and
female does anybody think that's going
to be a
negative does anybody think she can't be
president because she's
black nope nobody thinks that they might
think it might help that it might
actually be an advantage as it was for I
would say it was for president um Obama
because of the way he played it the way
he played it was I'm not going to be
your first black president I'm just
going to be president so for the most
part for the most part he didn't make it
a black thing he just made it a I'd be a
good president thing if she does the
same and I imagine she would it's going
to be really
powerful secondly how long ago has it
been since we actually talked
about you know there was there would be
some issue with a woman becoming
president that's not even in the
conversation anymore again I'm the only
I I think I'm the only person who says
this in the whole world but I I keep
saying it because I think it's so
important in your in your rush to judge
Hillary Clinton and and now both sides
are judging her for one thing or the
other let us not
forget that she did break the ultimate
glass ceiling and what I mean was she
got the most
votes and there's nobody in the
conversation about Hillary and and about
the 2016 race who really seriously
thinks that people were voting against
her for being a woman she obliterated
that obstacle she didn't win because of
The Oddities of the the electoral
college but she got the most votes and
in my opinion she has broken
forever the GL the ultimate glass
ceiling and the fact that she didn't
actually get the job was a technical
odity I think she deserves full credit
for that because when you talk about you
know Nikki Haley running or Gabby tulzer
or Cala Harris
or oh I'm sorry got a problem I have to
solve downstairs gotta go
