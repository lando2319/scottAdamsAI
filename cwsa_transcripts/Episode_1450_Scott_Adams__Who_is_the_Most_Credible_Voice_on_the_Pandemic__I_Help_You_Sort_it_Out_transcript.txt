morning everybody what an amazing day
and today will be one of the best
coffees with scott adams ever
because we have fun topics don't always
sometimes the news does not cooperate
but today yeah we got some good stuff
it's worth staying around for and all
you need to make this
a special day well i think you know
all you need is a copper mug or glass up
tanker jealous line the canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
means of the day the thing that makes
everything
better it's called the simultaneous hip
and it's gonna happen now go
ah yeah i feel every corp
muscle in my body coming alive because
the court bustles were a little bit dead
until now well
here's a here are some mysteries for you
things which are unanswered in the news
number one whatever happened to antifa
did they get everything they wanted now
i know they might be doing some stuff in
portland but
didn't they go from a big deal to
nothing
and before antifa what happened to
occupy wall street and all the concern
about the
income inequality did that get fixed
so there's no no need to protest anymore
or is it possible that these are
organizations that can be dialed up and
dialed down
by some hidden hands behind the scenes
it feels like they only come out when
you sort of need them
politically black lives matter
do they get everything they need or the
police the police are doing a good job
now right
no more targeting of black motorists
and pedestrians i
don't think so so
it feels as if there's somebody behind
the scenes
uh did somebody just give me a thousand
of something
that looks like some other kind of money
but i read your comment
um so is somebody
is there somebody behind the scenes who
can dial up black lives matter to
protest or not protest
because it feels like it that doesn't
mean it's true but
it's kind of a mystery where'd they go
is it because the news decides
everything but the news doesn't make the
march
so we got some mysteries here that are
weirdly not being investigated by the
news
and how about the biggest mystery of all
why is it that china is not having a
problem with the coronavirus
is it because they did such a good job
with masks and social distancing
is that why because if that's why i'd
like to see
our scientists say yeah definitely
mass and social distancing for some
reason it works really well in china
but it doesn't work in other places or
not as well
right i think it works everywhere but
not as well
what would cause that is it because the
chinese are so scared
that they stay inside but correct me if
i'm wrong
the delta variant it's going to get you
no matter where you are right
how does china escape the delta variable
kind of a mystery isn't it ian bremmer
mentioned on twitter that the chinese
vaccination is especially not effective
against the
delta variant because other smaller
countries use the chinese vaccination
and they're not doing too well
with their vaccination so on top of
china not
not having a problem with the
coronavirus they also
don't have an effective vaccination
now i could understand why israel is
doing well
they got vaccinated although i think
they're having a little setback at the
moment
so how is it that china has the worst
vaccinations
but the best outcomes
do we have anything like a press they
could look into that
because if the answer is they're really
really good at social distancing
shouldn't we be studying that every day
to find out what they did
because if they can social distance
better
we should do whatever they're doing
seems to work there
so i've got a feeling that there are a
lot of mysteries
that the news seems to be deeply
uninterested in
boy they care about january 6. we'll get
to that but first
uh i'd like to give you an update on the
olympics
uh the olympics uh update is that it's
still irrelevant in
and sexist that's the update
simone biles injured her foot so she's
out
so the very important sport of
you know jumping up and down and and uh
hanging from stuff
and flipping around sort of an important
human uh activity we won't be able to
see the best in the world
doing that and that's a tragedy and one
more reason why the olympics
should be discontinued
all right my favorite twitter exchange
was uh joe lockhart trying to dunk on
jesse waters
now here's what jesse waters said there
was a subject of a tweet
he said if you want to stop climate
change
this is what jesse waters said i guess
on the show on his show
one of his shows if you want to stop
climate change you don't fight climate
change if it's getting warmer you adapt
to it
so the point here being that
you know humans can adapt to a lot of
stuff
joe lockhart decides to mock jesse for
that by saying
jesse will be interviewing a dinosaur
today to see how well they adapted to
climate change
you have to work hard to be this dumb
that's right joe lockhart
who might be the dumbest person in all
of politics
just decided to tweet in public that
that jesse waters was dumb
for saying that humans could adapt to
climate
changes now in this analysis from joe
lockhart
i believe he has compared the
technologically
proud technology prowess of human beings
and their ability to analyze and test
and
adapt with all their high technology and
science
he's comparing this to the high tech
science of dinosaurs
and saying well if the dinosaurs with
all their high-tech
abilities couldn't adapt
how in the world can you expect a human
to do it jesse
you fool
gotcha i got you jesse
if the if the dinosaurs couldn't do it
how can a human do it
i mean common sense just use your noggin
jesse come on come on think a little
harder
if the dinosaurs couldn't pull it off
how can humans i mean really same same
thing
humans dinosaurs now i think that uh
jesse did make a mistake in his analysis
because
he's overlooking the dinosaur technology
but i've looked into dinosaur technology
and if you've ever looked at
dinosaur twitter terrible user interface
yeah the dinosaurs were terrible at the
user experience
and if you've ever seen a dinosaur
iphone
it's really it was hard for them to
assemble them because their their hands
are just like
you know tree trunks and so they're
trying to assemble
iphones and really it's more like a flat
rock
i mean you could call it an iphone but
it's a dinosaur iphone it's a flat rock
and you could try calling people on it
but it's not going to work it's not
going to work
so dinosaur technology very bad i just
thought i'd
let you know here's a good follow on
twitter i like to recommend people who
are
especially interesting consistently
uh raul davis ceo branding expert
you can find him at ceo underscore
branding on twitter but he tweeted this
he said harvard study shows up to 25 of
people fear needles
if vaccine were a gummy vitamin would
more people get
it now have you heard
even one person say to you
that they wouldn't get the vaccine
because they're afraid of needles
in the comments has anybody either made
that decision themselves
or have you heard anybody oh i see one
yes
i see a yes yes a friend wow
holy cow maybe more than i thought
so people would put their fear of the
needle
above their fear of the coronavirus
okay well um three friends and a dad
wow interesting now these would be the
same people who do get vaccinations
right they get the standard vaccinations
for
being in school and whatever so they
must they must have a way to get past
the needles if they have to
uh but apparently if it's optional
they're not going to do it
so i love this question so and this is
why you should follow
uh raul davis because he
he gets to the persuasion the persuasion
and marketing and branding stuff
he's real good at drilling down on that
stuff
so here's my question
and i'm going to talk about persuasion
technique
you're going to read into this more than
i intend
i'm not trying to persuade you to get
vaccinated
remember i think that would be unethical
because i could do it
i could persuade people to get
vaccinated
i do have that skill and i do have a
voice
right so i could i could convince some
people
if i wanted to do that but i definitely
don't want to do that
you know i see other people doing it it
makes me very uncomfortable i get why
they're doing it they're well
intentioned
but it's it just feels so unethical
you know i'm not a doctor talk to your
doctor i don't know what your risk is
anyway i say that too often but i do
like to talk about the
persuasion you know dimension
of how would you just for this
the intellectual experiment how would
you convince people who are hesitant
the first thing you would have to know
is that
people are hesitant for completely
different reasons
and therefore your persuasion game would
have to be crafted for each of those
segments and i would say that the people
who are
um worried about the vaccinations
and they're worried about the needle you
would need something targeted for them
i'll just i'll just throw out an idea
because you would have to test
a bunch of ideas against people to find
out what actually worked
so the best you can do as a persuader is
usually just try something see what the
response is then
try something else if that didn't work
so it's usually trial and error
kind of a process but here's one thing i
would
ask how many needles do you think you'll
get if you get hospitalized
and i don't know what the answer to that
is can somebody give me an estimate
maybe some of you have been hospitalized
for a covet has anybody here been
hospitalized for code
there'd be a few needles right um at
least the iv
i'm seeing some nope no but but
it depends if you get the the iv i guess
yeah um yep no needles
uh chance of dying yes but
so you would you would multiply your
chance of dying
times how bad it is to get an expected
value
and well that didn't make sense but
forget about that point
all right so because people are
irrational you know fear is largely
irrational wouldn't you say
fear of a physical needle would we all
agree that's 100 irrational
because the needle's never hurt anybody
like the actual needle itself the
physical needle
i believe it's never hurt anybody oh
interesting somebody said hypnosis
to get people past needle fear
you know what let me give you an
interesting hypothetical
suppose i could come up with a
reframing or a way to talk people on a
fear of needles
would that be ethical because i could do
it generically
just to make you not afraid of needles
should you need one for your own reasons
so it would be a general thing but it
would have the effect of getting more
people vaccinated wouldn't it
uh i'm saying a yes please
um yeah okay
so um
let me let me work on that i've never
really put any thought into it but it's
entirely possible that
a reframe or even some
some bit of exercise or something could
get you past the needle thing
you know maybe i'll make a video on that
because i feel like
the only way to make that work is to
make it a single point video
in which somebody who's got that fear
and wants to lose it
can just watch that video well we'll
think about that
all right here's the question given that
a lot of reasons for not getting
vaccinated would be irrational
and i think fear of needles would be an
irrational reason other people have
rational reasons
and i don't deny that but some of them
are irrational
and here's a question would a monetary
incentive work
for people who are not yet vaccinated
what's your first reaction to that if i
said suppose you just offered
money you just said i'll just pay you
to get vaccinated how many um
well you haven't heard the amount have
you
i'll say 300
i'm just going to pick a number 300
to get vaccinated would anybody
take it oh i say a couple of yeses
so i'm going to ask only the people who
are unvaccinated and maybe
were planning to stay that way if you're
unvaccinated
and you plan to stay that way would
three hundred dollars change your mind
anybody right now i'd expect
mostly no right i'm seeing just a wall
of no
no amount no amount because you're
saying to yourself the reason i didn't
do it
the reason i didn't do it is because
i've got this you know
deadly risk possibly
don't know how big it is it could be
tiny but
it's an unknown um i see somebody who
say yes for a thousand i doubt we could
get to a thousand
right all right here's here's a little
persuasion
tip for you all of you are answering
rationally i believe which is to say in
public
if somebody says would you give up your
i don't know
your your belief about vaccines for 300
almost nobody will say yes to that in
public predictably
right because nobody is going to sell
themselves out
for such a small amount but
suppose nobody's watching
here's one of these things that you
realize about human brains
that you don't want to be true the next
thing i say you don't want to be true
but
it's true privately
if nobody was going to know what you did
and you could get 300 for getting
vaccinated
some percentage of the people would do
it
they would because money influences
everything all the time there's never an
exception to it
you could take almost any topic and
offer
almost any amount of money somebody
is going to take it every time now it
might be a small percentage
but remember if you're trying to
influence people toward vaccinations
if you're trying to influence them
everybody's a different reason
maybe somebody can be bought one percent
maybe
but that helps right maybe some have a
needle fear
maybe you can shave a little of that off
you know it's going to be a
i think the reason it's going to it's
going to be hard to get anybody else
vaccinated is there's a whole bunch of
different reasons
it's not really one reason so you gotta
hit them all
all right um let me ask you this would
there be would it be illegal
or even impractical for health insurance
companies to start charging more
for the unvaccinated i'm not
recommending it
it's not a recommendation just a
question
would that make a difference suppose
your insurance and why wouldn't they
really
now somebody says it's illegal and i
would i would uh
point out that the government makes the
laws
right so let's say it's illegal congress
can change that
right they're pro mostly private
entities can't they set their prices
based on their expenses
if they know that there is going to cost
them more why not
now with some of you can say oh but if
you start doing that
you have to charge more for people who
are overweight you have to charge more
for people who don't exercise
what about the smokers a lot of blood
the drinkers
blah blah blah here's the difference
you can't track that other stuff
reliably
you can't really track if somebody's
drinking you can't really track if
they're eating right
because that would have to be some kind
of self-reporting etc
but the vaccination system i believe is
all in a
central database is it not isn't that
something you get a card and you can
kind of prove it
so it's different than almost anything
else because if the insurance companies
have access to that database
they just match you to the database i
think you
gave your social security number when he
got vaccinated
did you do that i know you gave your
driver's license right
just the driver's license i think so you
probably could just match people
and just give them you know
just give them a higher price if they're
unvaccinated
if that corresponds to your actual
expenses
now who would complain about that if
it was based on data you know if you
wanted to be
remain unvaccinated but you also
believed
that private companies can set their
prices based on risk
would you have a problem with them
setting their price based on what they
perceive to be the risk
if it costs you a little more you still
get you still get your preference which
is you're unvaccinated
but you'd pay for it because it's a
little more expensive
overall not for you specifically
yeah all right i did a
i did a very unscientific poll a series
of them a competition
with brackets to see who you trust the
most for pandemic opinions
because who you trust the most is
therefore the person who could persuade
the most effectively sort of a
hypothesis
the hypothesis is that whoever you trust
the most
is also the most persuasive so here's
here are the names that i put in my
highly sign unscientific
poll and i'll tell you why it's just uh
completely
uh polluted with uh polling errors
but uh i first asked people just to tell
me who they
who they were getting their information
from and that seeded the actual poll
itself
so the names that came up the most were
governor desantis tucker carlson
weinstein
dr scott atlas dr fauci alex berenson
trump steve bannon dr sanjay gupta i
threw him in there so we'd have
a cnn doctor peter navarro nasim talib
and then i put myself there because i
talk about this a lot
so in the in the early rounds i actually
did pretty well
i i think i won i won by bracket
in the uh quarterfinals which is
uh funny but here was the biggest
surprise
trump doesn't do well
for pandemic opinions which means that
even his supporters
understand that you're not going to get
your medical opinions from
trump he is a unrepentant
hyperbole machine and you don't get your
medical advice
from a salesman right you can love trump
and and love his way you know in his
sort of
perpetual optimism and win at all costs
and everything you can like that
but it's not free right it's not free
what comes with it is that he's not the
best voice
for medical decisions you could love
trump
and still say he's just not where i'm
going to get my medical advice
it's just the wrong place so i think
that's consistent
and i was surprised that politics and
just
you know maybe some loyalty for trump
because a lot of trump supporters are in
in my twitter um but he didn't do well
at all
and i think that's a good thing i think
that's a good thing people
understand politics versus
versus medicine but the winners
as of the last time i checked were
governor desantis
seemed to have swept through his
categories and dominated against tucker
carlson who was the other semi-finalist
and uh 63 percent last i checked anyway
we're voting for the governor now um
alex berenson didn't do so well
i think he came down to maybe the lower
half in the end
something like that maybe in the middle
somewhere and
there didn't seem to be much of a
correlation
between uh experience and credibility
the people who had doctor in front of
their names
didn't do so well not not dr fauci but
also not dr scott atlas
not dr sanjay gupta now in reality
in reality i think you would probably
take their advice over
a journalist right wouldn't you
if you if if you were standing in a room
next to an actual doctor
like md and the other one was tucker
carlson
would you really take tucker's advice
over the doctor like if you're in the
room
i don't think so i suppose it would
depend you know maybe on something like
masks you might go with tucker
but um so first of all the
this unscientific poll has no no
validity
unless there's some overwhelming kind of
thing that comes out of it
and i would say the overwhelming thing
that comes out of it is that ron
desantis
is a real strong contender for president
because if you can look to a politician
think about this he's a governor and he
was on the list with
um three doctors and you know
nasim talib who's you know famous for
his rationality
you know alex berenson who obviously
digs into this pretty deeply
brett weinstein again you know brilliant
guy digs into it pretty deeply
and still and still a governor
just swept the field now i think it's
people sort of maybe
also favoring him for president i think
that's what's happening here
so i would say at this point if trump
does not decide to run for president
and i think there's some chance he won't
my guess is he's leading
toward running but if he doesn't
uh i think desantis is just he's just
going to walk into the
at least into the primaries and
how he does will depend entirely on how
florida does with the coronavirus
so if florida does okay with the
coronavirus or at least you could make
that case
he would be president and if if if it's
easy to make the case that florida
didn't work
the democrats will certainly try to make
that case that he's going to have a
tough road
because it's all going to come down to
the coronavirus
but desantis is really
he's really separated from the crowd
right now
who would you if it's not trump running
as a republican in 2024
who else is even close to desantis right
now
in popularity i don't think anybody all
right
um vaccine mandates looks like they're
coming
the va is going to do it and 50 medical
groups
requiring it of the employees and
california state employees in new york
city
municipal workers and and even the sfr
san francisco bar owners were thinking
about doing it for the bars
so this is one of the reasons
um that i got vaccinated
again not trying to convince you to do
it but it was
obvious early on that you were going to
need to show that you were vaccinated
for a variety of things
now is that a good enough reason to get
vaccinated no
no don't get vaccinated just so you can
have some extra access
that's not the reason but it's our
reason
and and in my case which doesn't need to
be your
case again not trying to talk you into
anything
um it mattered because i was sort of
desperate to get back to something that
looked like real life
i wanted to live my life with as many
lack of restrictions as i could if that
doesn't mean as much to you
then by all means choose differently
oh back to desantis here's his problem
florida counts for one in five new
infections at the moment
and it had
i think it's like second only to
louisiana in a number of cases
and so they're they're having a real
problem there and desantis is hanging
tough
with no no masks in schools
when schools reopen and i feel like he
can't win either way
sort of a trap because if
if the infections are high which they're
going to be
and he doesn't clamp down
then all the moderates are going to say
ah you know he should have clamped down
he's just being political you know
holding out as long as he can
for republicans but now it's so bad
maybe he should have clamped down
now i'm not saying those people would be
right or wrong but they might not vote
for him if they think
they're not he's not doing his job so
almost no matter what he does
if he requires masks republicans won't
like him if he doesn't require masks in
the face of
uh having one of the worst infection
rates which is where he's heading
or is um he's losing other people
so he's got two ways to lose on this and
the only way he could win
is if the virus itself went into
remission
i don't know he's gonna i don't think
he's gonna get enough vaccinations for
that to happen
all right let's talk about the so-called
house select
committee sounds pretty important
doesn't it this is the
people looking into the january 6th
thing
which the republicans describe as a
partisan jam
so is it the house select committee
or is that the partisan jam committee
i think we should brand this the
partisan sham committee
two republicans that nancy pelosi put on
it
are the two most anti-republican
republicans liz cheney and adam
kinzinger
guaranteeing that whatever result
will not be credible now
why would you put together such a you
know
high visibility thing uh
the pelosi select committee yes that's
what it is pelosi selected them
how can you do such a high visibility
thing
that's just guaranteed to be a
partisan champ
how does that help democrats the answer
is
a lot because the more they can make the
news
about their partisan jam which is
you know they're going to focus on the
violence of the republicans etc
it's great for politics so it has
nothing to do with the good of the
country i think at this point but
grave for politics so i would say
persuasion wise
pelosi gets a a plus for persuasion
she just has to keep it in the news
that's all and she's doing it
is it ethical no no not even close
is nowhere near an ethical but it's
effective
so if you want to be an unethical
persuader
there's a good example how to do it
here's the dog that wasn't barking and i
thought it was interesting at the same
time that the
uh partisan sham committee is looking
into january 6
there's an article about the same topic
on cnn what word do you expect them to
use
when they're talking about the january
sex events
insurrection right can you imagine that
there would ever be
a lengthy article about january 6
on cnn with cnn contributors
that would never mention the word
insurrection
it happened it happened today zachary
cohen and
marshall cohen
they wrote an article on cnn and it's a
lengthy article talking about a number
of issues and never once
did they call it an insurrection why
well i think the fact that nobody got
charged with anything related to
insurrection may have something to do
with it
maybe the fact that no court
has found any insurrection
just the way no court is found in the
massive voter fraud
no court is found in the insurrection i
don't think anybody's been charged with
insurrection
so i think at some point cnn had to drop
that and
maybe these two writers are to their
credit
credible and ethical i mean i don't know
them
but i would just judge based on the fact
that they wrote an article on cnn
without using the word insurrection
i would give them some credibility for
that and i would say that that's
probably an ethical stand
and i would be really curious if the cnn
editors ever asked them to use it
do you think do you think there was ever
a conversation they turned in their
piece
do you think the editor who decides
whether it goes on to the site or not
do you think the editor read it and said
you know you know what would make this
better
one word can you just slip that in there
i don't know if that happened of course
but
if it did happen these two writers must
have held out so
i'm guessing they deserve some credit
but i don't know that for sure
so pop star pink made a great persuasion
play today
so there's this uh olympic uh
controversy
because there was a i guess one of the
beach volleyball teams wanted to wear
shorts instead of bikini bottoms
and i guess the olympics was rejecting
that
and wanted them to wear the traditional
bikini bottoms because
i think you all know that
the sport of beach volleyball isn't
nearly as good unless you can see as
much
of the female participants buttocks as
possible
i think that's the argument the olympics
is making
that you have to see as much buttocks as
possible
or the sport doesn't work is that their
argument
because they don't have a good argument
let's put it that way and
um pink pop star pink
has offered to pay the fines he ended to
the
norwegian women's beach team for not
wearing the bikini bottles
bottoms now i don't know how much the
fines will be can't be that much i would
imagine
but what a smart play for pink
puts her in the news in a positive light
she is she's not just bitching about it
she's like doing something
you know pay the fine which is actually
a very practical thing to do
because it allows other people to do the
same thing gives them freedom to do that
so good play pink i give you an a plus
for persuasion
she saw an opening and she took it
now let's talk about the topic um
has anybody ever had this experience do
any of you have
daughters who participated in volleyball
in high school have any of you
go into a volleyball tournament of young
girls
and were you as uncomfortable there as i
was
because i've been through that
experience it's really uncomfortable
because the girls there are very young
you know 14 to 17 or whatever is the
tournaments
and they wear these um
inexplicably tight short shorts
that volleyball players where for no no
functional reason
it's not like they need you know extra
uh
you know extra wind resistance or
something there's just no reason
and it's it looks
totally sexualized like and it's just
really creepy and the
volleyball thing in the olympics is
exactly the same thing
beach volleyball was a tv sport
because the women were scantily dressed
i mean that was certainly part of the
sport
60 let's be honest
beach volleyball is only a sport
because the players look good in bikinis
right i mean that was the sport
basically it's a it's a spectator sport
so um i agree with
pink and um i think it's
i think it should change i think the
athletes should dress like athletes
i don't think athletes should dress like
strippers
like what the hell somebody says men's
swimmers suits swimming is the one thing
and maybe maybe running if there's a
speed element
skiing you know you can see that they
need tight clothes because they got some
wind resistance and stuff
but i don't know that your whole body
needs to be hanging out
does it now i'm far from a prude
but you know especially in the case of
high school you're talking about young
girls
so all right different
topic uh famous
critic of uh covid related uh
policies alex berenson tweeted today
a question i don't know if it makes any
sense i'll just run it by you
uh he said hold on here folks what if
they're not vaccines
i don't mean in the conspiracy sense i
mean legally
if they're therapeutics no one can be
forced to take them
not without an individual core order and
finding of
incompetency is that true
that doesn't really connect to anything
i'm aware of but i
but the problem might be just what i'm
aware of i don't know that it doesn't
make sense
i just don't understand it is there some
kind of law
that says the government can force you
to take something called a vaccination
but they can't force you to take
something called a therapeutic
is there anything to that and
would it matter because you know
congress can change the law
and the courts can interpret it to be
anything they want so i would think that
a court could just say
i see your point but i'm just going to
call it a vaccine
because it gives you some lasting
immunity not complete
so i'll just put a question mark on this
because i don't think it'll matter in
the long run
we'll just redefine them as vaccines if
they're not
if the if there's a practical reason to
do that
so i got into a little conversation on
twitter with paul graham
you might know paul graham a famous
venture capitalist co-founder of y
combinator
writer um one of the more productive
thinkers i would say in the country um
and always has good opinions i would say
so we got into a little bit of an
opinion disagreement here um
i think i i tweeted something about how
people don't trust scientists
and that's and other ins and politicians
and
social media et cetera and that's why
they don't get vaccines
they don't trust the scientists or don't
trust science
and paul graham tweeted this he says if
if you think you don't trust scientists
you're mistaken you trust scientists in
a million different ways every time you
step on a plane
or for that matter turn on your tap or
open a can of beans
the fact that you're unaware of this
doesn't mean it's not so
so do he and i really have a
disagreement
not really we're sort of into you know
word thinking here
but i said i trust engineers because an
engineer needs to keep that that
airplane in the air every time right
the engineer has to get it right every
time
and so they don't do anything unless
it's been tested to death
right that's that's what engineers do so
by the time an engineer tells you
something works
it works i mean not every time but
pretty close and that's that's what
engineering is
but scientists by their nature are
flailing around with hypotheses and
testing things and 50 of the uh
of the peer-reviewed studies end up to
be
right so science science is working the
speculative just guessing hey this looks
like a good trial let's try this kind of
realm
of course they're going to make more
mistakes and even when they've done
something like create a vaccine
yeah they still don't disagree they
don't still agree on everything
right they're always going to be some
scientists on the other side
um you know i would say there's more
likelihood
of a vaccine having a side effect
than there is of an engineer building a
bridge that falls down
so i tend to trust engineers
but not so much science or scientists
although
science as a process is the best one we
have right
you don't have to trust something you
can still say it's the best you have
if it's the best you have and science is
the best we have
it just has lots of you know
inefficiencies like
lots of things so uh
claire layman weighed in and
on the side of well i don't know maybe
just making your own point
and said that science technology and
engineering and mathematics
stem are grouped together for a reason
to which i said the reason is not based
on their similar
levels of credibility yeah there's a
reason
but it's not relevant to the discussion
anyway i think this was just
word thinking i don't think any of us
would disagree if we're standing in the
same room talking about it
michael schellenberger points out
there's a there's a forbes article
that germany's renewable experiment is
over
he says in a tweet so michael says that
by 2025
germany will have spent 580 billion
dollars
to make electricity nearly two times
more expensive
and ten times more carbon intensive than
francis
not so good now i would say that germany
has
one gigantic management problem
i don't think germans are irrational
but they're kind of caught in this whole
holocaust
legacy where if you're germany
i think you have to be better than good
people
like i think you have to be the greenest
of the green the
the most anti-racist of any anti-racist
the most progressive and in whatever
ways makes sense
i feel as if they got trapped by their
own history
that you know they can't tiptoe into
renewables they've got to be like oh
we're so green we're the greenest of
green
we'll save the world yeah we tried to
destroy the world but we're saving the
world now
gonna save the world and i feel like
that skews
their decision-making and
if you say to me hey i want you know
germany to have a bunch of nuclear
power plants it just sounds a little
scary doesn't it
if you've got the you know the specter
of world war
ii is still in your mind i don't know
how much nuclear anything i want them to
have but i assume they have nuclear
power
but um
yeah there's a there's a guilt
issue that i think is affecting their
decision making
don't know for sure but i would
speculate that to be the case it seems
reasonable
all right have i covered everything
why did the germans import muslims by
the millions
if they care about anti-semitism
obviously they don't want to be racist
was that a hard question i think you
overpaid for that
um
oops wow these comments are flinging by
uh yeah germany does have nuclear power
but they're going
as green as they can go i think they
were looking to close their nuclear
plants if they could do it
um like bill nye the engineer guy yeah
need to call it new generation nuclear
or something that improves the framing
yeah i i still like generation four
all right how the hell is merkel still
in charge
good question um
there's nothing green about wind
turbines and solar panels
they are a problem in a number of ways
yes
your response to anti-semitism and
muslims did not make sense
could you clarify in what way do
importing racists into your society
well muslims are not presumed to be
racist
that's it why would you presume
anybody's racist
just because some members of a group are
clearly racist
that's every group so and here i'm being
devil's advocate you know you're
i'm taking germany's point of view if
you're germany
you have to be the the wokest you can be
which means that you don't judge anybody
based on the fact that
some of them might be bad
but if you're telling me statistically
is it a good play
uh we don't use statistics to make those
decisions
um see farina says i still love you but
the muslims hate the jews in their bible
love you well there there's certainly
a reason to believe that
many muslims have bad feelings about
many jews
so nobody's arguing that but the point
is if you make decisions like that
you're a racist and germany doesn't want
to be a racist
so they have two bad choices and they
pick the one that looks
the least bad to them it's best you can
do i'm not defending it
i'm just saying that they're they're in
a position where they have to be the
the least racist looking they could
possibly be and they decided that's what
that's what looks the least racist
they've decided you could argue that i
think
um
all right is there a doctrine well
here's the thing
i i get the i get the idea
that especially in other countries you
know muslims have uh
an attitude about jews that's just not
going to go away and it's not good
but unless they all have it you're being
a racist
if you don't let them in for that reason
all right um
it's a slippery slope i'm not saying
it's not dangerous
you know there's a certain risk that you
take on with any mass
immigration and they've decided to take
that risk
all right that's about all i got for
today i'm going to
uh go do some other stuff and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
