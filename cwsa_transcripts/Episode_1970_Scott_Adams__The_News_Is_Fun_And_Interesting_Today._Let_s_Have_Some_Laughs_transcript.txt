to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been anything better
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
well there's a way there is a way all
you need is a cover of mug or a glass
attacker a Tankard a tanker jealous or
Stein a canteen Joker flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamediate of the day
the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
it happens now go
yeah that's good
that's really good
so uh I saw that representative Ted Liu
Democrat
he uh tweeted some coven stuff in
response to the Twitter files Revolution
Revelations about fauci Etc
and uh
Ted Lou was immediately fact-checked by
Elon Musk
apparently uh Ted Liu was linking to
some incorrect Dakota information
and so Ted had to delete his tweets
now the interesting thing is
uh
it looked to me like obviously wrong
information like Ted Lou was not well
informed
it was like he wasn't even up to date on
you know the covered stuff which is
really scary because he's one of the
people in charge sort of
but how much do you love that
how much do you love
the Ted Lou tweeted some about
covet on Twitter got immediately slapped
down in fact Jack didn't have to run
away with his tail between his legs
[Laughter]
supposed to enjoy it
I should simply observe it
but but there's something broken inside
me something deep inside me is broken
and it made me enjoy it
if there's something deep inside you
that's also broken you might be enjoying
it too
so uh all of us have broken people we
can have a good laugh now
what if I told you I was going to do
between now and the end of the year
positivity
positivity
so let me say that I actually enjoy
representative Ted Lou
I've had a number of interactions with
them on Twitter and I have to say he's
sort of a cheerful Warrior
he seems like a decent guy I could hang
out with him easily like like we could
we could be friends like he just seems
like a cool guy so I like him
all right you know he's not going to be
right on everything he's a he's a
Democrat and so he's gonna cheer his
team but decent guy
I would say don't hate Ted Lou
um my my other favorite story all the
stories are funny today
I think every story is a little bit
funny
is it just me maybe am I just in that
mood or something or is are all the news
stories just a little bit funny
so there's a Republican
who Wanna you won a traditional blue
scene George Santos
and you want to see the New York suburbs
and typically had been uh you know a
Democrat
uh seat but I guess he ran a really good
race
because you want a traditional Democrat
area
uh the only problem is uh uh basically
everything in his resume was made up
so he didn't go to college where he said
didn't have the you know the career that
he said
uh several of his employees were not
killed in the pulse uh nightclub
shooting
and the the list of things that he
claimed was sort of hilariously uh
extreme but here's the one that my
favorite part of all the of all the fake
resume and stuff my favorite part was he
founded a charity called friends of pets
friends of pets United in 2013 but the
IRS and the attorney generals of New
York and New Jersey could find no record
of it being registered as a tax exempt
organization
and there was some animal group that
co-hosted a 50 a ticket fundraiser with
Santos in 2017 and said it never
received any of the proceeds
now I don't know maybe it's because I
already know it was a scam
but if I saw something friends of Patsy
United it just sounds like it's made up
doesn't it friends of pets United
because you know somebody's going to
give that money if if you ever want to
do a scam friends of pets
so now there's a conversation about
whether he should be removed for office
for having lied about everything
what do you think should he be removed
from office somehow I don't know how
they do that for having lied about
everything
not in this world
not not in this United States
because that's not a standard you could
ever employ
because every single member of Congress
would have to be removed on the same
standard
so apparently he discovered what Trump
discovered
well one of the things I always laugh
about is that all politicians know that
lying works that's why they do it lying
Works in politics
but I think Trump found the uh he found
the uh the little uh Gap where nobody
had noticed I I think he started saying
wait a minute lying works and there's no
limit to how much of it I can do
that's right
so I can basically just say anything I
want
that's right
why would I say anything that's true if
lying works we don't know
so just say those windmills are gonna
stop turning when the wind stops and the
TV will stop working and everything will
be fine
and it was completely true it didn't
matter how many times he he failed the
fact checking
he failed the fact checking more than
anybody could ever imagine
did it make any difference at all
in the end was was Trump removed because
of his fact checking no the fact Jackie
had no impact on anything
Trump knew that somehow somehow we knew
it wouldn't make any difference
this guy decides that anything he says
about his past as long as it works
ah
good enough so he just tells these wild
lies that are like Way Beyond The Pale
apparently allegedly and uh it worked
got him elected
so all he did is he proved that he knows
how to use the rules better than the
other people
because if people underlied and and they
didn't lie enough and they didn't get
elected well I guess that's on them
isn't it because he just set the
standard
I'm only half kidding
I'm only half kidding
well China loosened its covered
restrictions at exactly the time that
the virus is Raging the the strongest
so that gives you confidence that
government is
on the ball even in China
now you know what it sounds like to me
it sounds like to me if China is going
to be ravaged by the Omicron presumably
they're going to make sure everybody
else is too I I feel like they they
decided well we're not going to contain
it here we might as well open it up to
travel which is what they did now you
still have to get a Cova test I think
but it's not as not as strict as it was
how many people did I hypnotize to get
the vaccine well let me ask let us ask
that question
did anybody get vaccinated because of me
did anybody make a decision a medical
decision based on me
there's a yes so what if you despite me
saying every single day don't make any
medical decisions based on me some of
you wouldn't have did it
would that be an example of following my
advice or following the opposite of my
advice
because if I tell you don't take my
advice on medical stuff
and then you took my advice on medical
stuff would that be a case of following
my advice or not following my advice
it's a little tricky isn't it because I
told you not to do it very clearly
very clearly told you not to do it
following my advice that is
but but I I acknowledge that I
acknowledge the comment
that it with a big audience some people
would be influenced and for their own
reasons I suppose
but yeah that's probably a thing
that's probably a thing and I would even
go further I'll bet you if I told you
every day don't take the vaccination
and then I checked with you later like a
year later and said all right did
anybody hear me say I didn't do this by
the way but this is speculative like
imaginary if I had told you every day
don't take the vaccination and then I
checked with you today and said did
anybody get vaccinated
because I told you for a year not to
there would be yeses
because people say yeah you're so
non-credible that you were so insistent
I just figured it'd be a good idea to go
get the so with a big enough crowd
you're going to get
you'll get people on both sides in every
situation
but yeah probably that's probably true
there's something I said convince
somebody to get a vaccination despite me
having no intention of doing that
probably
um
so Dr Robert Malone is tweeting that
there's a new meta-analysis of
ivermectin
does this sound like repeat news
that doesn't seem like Groundhog Day
we've been here before
and how will this story go well people
will say Dr Robert Malone is the
inventor of the MRNA technology and he's
been saying Ivermectin Works probably
for a long time and now this meta study
which is the best of all kinds of
studies say some people
shows that there's a very identifiable
effect
positive effect of ivermectin so so then
we conclude
that we have this big meta-analysis this
shows that uh 29 out of 63 studies
showed that Ivermectin has a positive
effect and if you if you do a
meta-analysis where you take all the
studies and kind of lump them together
the the average or the net I guess the
net would be the way to say it the net
is that Ivermectin it looks like it
works
so so we're done here right
big old meta-analysis 63 studies 29 say
Ivermectin work and then the the doctor
who is the inventor of mRNA technology
or at least he was involved with the
invention of it says take a look at this
so is everybody good now is that a
settled science now
you're all settled right
oh
you have complaints about meta-analysis
all right so here's my theme that I've
been telling you for a while is is Dr
Robert Malone credible on medical
questions yes or no
is Dr Robert Malone credible on medical
questions
I think we'd all say yes now that's
different from being right
correct
right that would be his area of
expertise and when he's talking in his
area of expertise
I feel I would be influenced by his
opinion that doesn't mean he's right
you know experts can be wrong but yes he
would be a credible voice in the medical
field specifically this now how many of
these studies did Dr Robert Malone do
I think zero right like he didn't do any
studies so he's looking at studies so
what what is uh Dr Robert Malone's
expertise in evaluating studies and
specifically his experts expertise in
meta studies
none none
so what you're hearing is somebody
completely outside of his field of
expertise giving you some information in
a tweet
if somebody completely outside their
field of expertise data analysis
tweet something should you say well
that's credible because it came from
somebody who's an expert in an unrelated
wealth related but a different field
you should give it no credibility yeah
the the correct way to analysis to
analyze that is it doesn't matter who
tweeted it because it's not his field
um now did you catch my magic trick
how many of you caught the magic trick
I told you that 29 out of 63 studies
says it works
you know that's less than half right
how did how did you hear it as it works
if most of the studies say it doesn't
and yet you heard that it works
how did you hear that
does that mess up your brain a little
bit I I said it I said it plainly I said
that fewer than half of them say it
works which means
most of the studies say it doesn't work
most of them
now a meta-analysis you take the ones
you know the ones that say no the ones
that say yes and you put them all
together as if it were one big study
just artificially and then you see what
that looks like do you know why that
doesn't work
do you do either a meta study of this
nature is completely unreliable
because it depends entirely on whether
the biggest studies were right or not
if the biggest studies were correct like
they got the right answer then you got
the right answer when you put them all
together because they they biased it
toward the big studies if the biggest
study happened to be wrong
and remember roughly half of the studies
were on the other side
so you don't know if you're picking you
don't know if the biggest study
was right or wrong you just know that it
biased the entire average so much that
it was like basically it was just that
one study that mattered which could have
been wrong now how many studies are
typically wrong
just in general not not about covid but
in general about half yeah about half of
all studies turn out to be debunked
now of the half that are not debunked
how many of them are valid
half of all studies get debunked
have to not does that mean the half that
do not get debunked are the good ones
nope it doesn't mean that at all it
means they just haven't been debunked
it doesn't mean they're true
so something less than half of studies
end up being true
so if somebody if all you heard was
there's a new study there's only been
one of them ever there's a new study and
it's on anything anything at all what is
your opinion
it's not true
yeah because the odds if you just play
the odds of every new study you should
assume it's not true
it could be true
but if you're playing the odds you say
it probably not probably not
so once again we have this uh we have
what I call laundering of expertise
so somebody's using somebody else's
expertise to launder their own views
through it
in this case uh Dr Malone I'm sure from
all indications has an opinion about
Ivermectin being
likely a positive thing and he might
have a little bit of a motivated
analytical view of this
now just to be clear did I just tell you
that Ivermectin doesn't work
or did I tell you it does what did I
just do
neither right and both neither
and I've been consistent from the
beginning
that the longer you go without a
confirmation that it does work the less
likely you're going to ever get one
doesn't mean it doesn't I've never ruled
it down it never ruled it out but
there's no evidence that would convince
me yet
good I could easily be persuaded but
nothing yet
um how many papers are related to covid
not not just about Ivermectin but covet
in general just take a guess
how many uh scientific papers have been
retracted by the authors meaning they
published a result and then said oops
usually because somebody else pointed it
out oops and then had to pull them back
I don't know the percentage but 224.
224
scientific coven related papers have
been withdrawn by the authors where even
the author says oops
oops that was a mistake
I think usually it's the author who also
agrees in some cases it might be the
scientific publication itself I think
but I think the author usually also is
part of it
yeah so yeah the question is out of how
many right by how many do you think
how many scientific papers oh
and how many of them should have been
withdrawn that have not been withdrawn
yet I don't know but you should be aware
that the the state of science is chaos
so you know be be uh be an informed
consumer when you hear A study says
something
all right
um speaking of studies
I like studies that
are amusing so there's a new study that
asking people in society who they Trust
the people they trust the most still are
scientists
so Society
trust scientists the most and of all the
different categories of people
probably a good thing I mean compared to
the Alternatives who do you think they
trust the least the answer is government
and journalists are the two at the
bottom they trust the least their
government and journalists and they
trust the most scientists now here's the
trick question see if you can get this
right
why do people trust scientists the most
why why are they at the top who where
did you get that information
because you probably have the same
opinion
you believe it because
who told you that science is what you
should trust
the government
and journalists
told you to trust science do you know
why
because then when the government that
you don't trust and the journalists you
don't trust tell you to do something
they will say don't trust us look at the
science that we funded and then look at
that don't look at the science that we
suppressed
so the the two groups that you trust the
least government which includes schools
right governments determine what the
schools are doing so governments and
journalists tell you that the scientists
or who you should trust and then they
use those scientists to launder their
own
um preferences through them so they say
oh oh
uh this is a good policy you should all
do it because the scientists say so why
do you believe the scientists well don't
believe us believe the scientists why do
you believe the scientists because the
people you don't trust told you to
believe them
am I wrong
do you think you were born and you just
sort of grew up knowing scientists or
who to trust that was that like a
natural organic thing did you did you do
your own investigation did you do a deep
dive huh who should I trust let me do
some research find out who to trust nope
nope the people you trust the least
the government
and journalists tell you every day to
trust the scientists and so you do
because you believe the people you
believe the least
why do you believe that I don't know
I don't know I have no idea why you do
that stop doing that
don't do that
all right uh Whoopi Goldberg as you know
was suspended from the view I guess I
don't know is she back or permanently
suspended I don't know don't care but uh
she said controversial things about
anti-semitism
and she said it's not about race she
said the Holocaust wasn't about race and
was simply white on white violence
because Nazis were white and according
to her
Jews were white
now as one Jewish expert
well actually just a smart guy I guess I
don't know if he was expert
described and I think it was a good
description is that whether or not Jews
are considered white depends entirely
upon your own bias it has nothing to do
with them like you know if you want to
be racist well then they're whatever you
want if you don't want to be racist then
they're whatever you want yeah whatever
works for you so basically it's like the
one group where nobody seems to be able
to agree
it's just you know do we want to be do
we want to be uh abusing them today well
then we'll say it's this or that
so and I agree with that I think that
there's a like a cultural you know
agreed upon definitions of things that
is different from whatever scientific
things it would be
and so uh Goldberg Whoopi did apologize
but now she's doubling down I guess
saying more things about that
um but I have some advice for you on
this topic
whatever you do
don't ask chat GPT the new AI
if being Jewish is a race
don't do it
because
it's going to agree with Whoopi Goldberg
and that's not good
so we can't have that now I did check I
did check now remember I'm not saying
that the AI is correct because the
entire context here is that AI doesn't
handle political stuff well you know
there's somebody's got their finger on
the on the button on on the AI
so let me be very clear I'm not I'm not
endorsing the ai's view of things I'm
just saying that if you check chat GPT
today and you ask them who is more
technically accurate on this question
they'll tell you a whoopee right
depending how you ask the question now
the other thing you need to know is that
uh
the way you ask the question can
completely change the answer
so AI doesn't have one answer for Stuff
weird right it'll give you a different
answer depending on the exact way you
ask the question so that there might be
several ways you could ask the question
to get the exact opposite answer
but here's my point it has nothing to do
with the Whoopi anti-Semitism thing
she's on her own I'm not going to defend
a Whoopi
Whoopi's on her own right she knew what
she was doing
so uh
my bigger point is this
what are we going to do when AI start
starts to disagreeing with us on stuff
what are we going to do
now this wasn't like the great point for
that you know larger larger theme is
more just to remind you of it that it
could be a problem because at the moment
I don't think anybody's taking AI
seriously
right you shouldn't at its current stage
it's like an infant
so you wouldn't take an infant's opinion
you know too seriously you'd say oh
that's interesting and it'll be
something better someday but you can't
take it too seriously right now
um
Politico hilariously has an article uh
and uh the Tweet headline is it's an
opinion it says it could be that 2022
marks the year our love affair with
narcissists started to falter and then
the writer
uh who I know you'd want me to say her
name
because
people like this
oh that's interesting I didn't write her
name down well
I hope she's not a narcissist since I
didn't remember her name
um
but apparently uh Politico tweeted that
this new opinion article was out and
then they had to take down their tweet
because they forgot to give credit
uh to the author
so the Tweet didn't credit the author
so the author
who is writing about other people being
narcissists you know they like to get
attention for the stuff that they do
Politico decided that the author who is
writing about people who don't get
enough attention wasn't getting enough
attention
now I don't know if management decided
to fix that or if the author noticed it
and said hey my article about
narcissists who are trying to get
attention does not give me enough
attention
and then they fixed it I mean I don't
know
I'm just I'm just saying it's possible
that the author Caught it and asked for
a be an upgrade but more likely probably
more likely the editors caught it
themselves and wanted to give her a
proper proper Credit Now the the
narcissist
alleged narcissist who the author
identifies would be uh no surprise
Donald Trump
uh Elon Musk they threw him in there and
yay of course yay
and Meghan Markle
Meghan Markle what do you think happened
uh
what do you think happened when they
threw Meghan Markle in the narcissist
category
the a good number of the Politico
readers went what
what narcissist I don't say a narcissism
with Meghan Markle all I see is somebody
who's part black and is being
subject of horrible racial
discrimination and you should stop
saying this strong black women are
narcissists
because there's nothing like that going
on that's for sure
huh
now
do you know what projection is
projection is when you think the other
person has a problem that you have
do you think that a person who writes
opinion pieces in Politico
doesn't like attention
now I get that there are people who like
attention and people who don't but do
the people who don't like attention
become writers for Politico and do
opinion pieces
right because an opinion piece is the
ultimate attention grabbing thing right
if I wrote an article a factual article
you wouldn't remember who wrote it would
you
you wouldn't even care yeah Joanna Weiss
I think you wouldn't even care if it
were just a factual article it's just
that you give me the facts but if it's
an opinion piece
a depending piece is about the writer
isn't it
that's the point it's one person's
opinion you should all know my opinion
my opinion is so important you must all
be subjected to my opinion and then you
should give me some attention from my
opinion
is pure narcissism
now am I projected
yes of course I am
because I'm a narcissist
it's what we do
at least I'm aware of it
but here's the only defense I give
myself
I'm the good guy
I'm the good kind
I think Elon Musk is the good kind
he would like to get I'm sure I mean
I've never asked him this question but
you know a decent understanding of human
beings
means probably he's proud of his
accomplishments maybe he'd like you to
notice
don't you think don't you think he'd
like to be known
as somebody who fixed big problems of
course
do you think he's doing it only for the
money apparently not because he has
enough of that
so something is driving him to do things
which
a lot of people including me would say
seem overwhelmingly positive for society
You could argue that but that's my
opinion and do you want do you want
fewer of him
who wants fewer Elon musks I want as
many people trying to get attention for
themselves as possible by doing really
hard things that are good for society
right
now I've told you that my um
my organizing principle for Life maybe I
only told the locals people
my organizing principle is to have the
largest
funeral that I could possibly have
does that not sound like the most
narcissistic thing anybody ever said
it's exactly that it's not even slightly
anything else it's not even like well
it's a little bit of this and a little
bit no it's it's only that it's that
exactly
and it motivates me
should it I don't know I you know I
don't argue you should
I just argue yes or no does it it does
so it motivates me in a way that I think
could be good for the rest of you
so let's do more of that now is Meghan
Markle
motivated by making the world a better
place
I don't know I can't read her mind
it's entirely possible that her inner
thoughts are as pure as
they could possibly be maybe I don't
know
um but nothing nothing that I observe
would suggest she's anything but
exactly what most of you think
you know I don't even I'm not going to
label her because I feel that's unfair
but I feel like
you can all see what's there
you're all looking at the same stuff it
might be two movies on one screen but
you can certainly all make your own
observation
yeah bless her heart
yes George Steele that is exactly why I
stopped the sentence where I did because
you would have said that
um all right
here's one of the best reframes I've
seen in a while
you know how we get all worked up over
opinion pieces like that one
why did we get worked up over opinion
pieces
here's a reframe to help you out from
Henry Henry
that's his Twitter name Henry Henry yeah
he says I usually ignore opinion pieces
since it's just one person's opinion I
think of it more like a diary
a diary
that's perfect
because you would not be influenced by
somebody's opinion in a diary
right it's the because the diary tells
you that's just somebody thinking
thoughts it has nothing to do with you
it's just their own private situation
the fact that they published it in
Politico
doesn't make it any less their private
thoughts they're just public now
so why would you care
why would anybody care about anybody's
diary thoughts
it's kind of kind of a good reframe it's
a good reframe I think I might use that
one
I might borrow this Henry Henry
note to self
all right uh
interesting exchange between I guess
investor Ross Gerber
and Elon Musk on Twitter
so
Ross Gerber tweeted Tesla stock price
now reflects the value of having no CEO
great job Tesla board of directors time
for a shakeup
and then uh Elon Musk responded because
turns out he spent some time on Twitter
himself
he says please tell us your great ideas
Ross
now
here's my advice
if Elon Musk ever invites you to a
public debate
on Twitter
don't do it
don't do it run away run away Ross run
away but Ross did not run away
he explained this
um as I tweeted earlier my three points
number one Tesla needs a media and comms
team
two Tesla needs a succession plan as
well as clarify when Elon will be back
from Twitter
three Tesla needs to communicate about
elon's stock sales and a standstill
agreement should be made
Elon Musk tweets back
go back and read your old Securities
analysis 101 textbook he says
in simple terms as a Bank savings
account interest rates which are
guaranteed start to approach the stock
market returns which are not guaranteed
people will increasingly move their
money out of stocks and Into Cash thus
causing stocks to drop
now
there is of course more to the story
than just interest rates
you know savings accounts they don't
guarantee you that you can't lose your
money above a certain amount you know so
and and interest rate isn't everything
and of course the individual company
performance is the biggest Factor even
bigger than interest rates Etc
but
generally speaking musk is right and
here here's why I'll get a backup
Ross is right
that something like the actions of the
CEO can move the stock in the short rung
would you all agree
that the actions of the CEO and how much
trust he has can certainly move the
stock in the short run and we're
probably seeing that
I think we're seeing it it looks like
angry people on the left are buying
fewer Teslas probably stuff like that
right but Elon Musk has never given any
credibility or attention to short-term
moves and stocks has he he's always
consistently said he's even said his
stock was too high
do you remember that he said in public
yeah I think Stock's too high and then
light came down immediately
and why why was he willing to crash his
own stock in the short term
because the short-term price of Tesla
isn't important
so he he could even crash his own stock
in the short term because it wasn't
didn't mean anything the short term is
not why you buy stock right it's all
long term
so in the long term interest rates are
the biggest Factor on stock prices but
not every stock the same way right some
are more effective than others so I do
think that there's something happening
with Tesla that goes beyond interest
rates would you agree
but probably we're looking at short-term
effects
in five years do you think the Twitter
story will be the Tesla story
they could be but that would be hard to
predict
so you know you have to take a five-year
uh range you know the the whole Elon
Musk Twitter story could be over in 12
months
you know in 12 months you could have a
strong president he could have pulled
completely back
people still like good cars
Tesla takes off I mean anything could
happen
Anything Could Happen
but
I wouldn't do a debate with Elon Musk in
public about anything really that's not
going to work out
uh what do you think about uh was it
Abbott who shipped to 50
recent immigrants to
Kamala Harris's home in D.C
and what did the people on the left say
you monsters
because they were dropped off in 15
degree temperatures
freezing temperatures
people who had no homes
dropped off in 15 degree temperatures
and then they had to sleep on the
sidewalk for the rest of their lives
terrible
wait I'm getting an update it turns out
that nobody nobody slept on the sidewalk
actually no none of them slept on the
sidewalk
update uh they're they all they all were
indoors somewhere I don't know where but
they all slept indoors getting more
updates it turns out that the
temperatures indoors are very similar
everywhere in America
right right around 70 degrees you know
some 60 80 some 72. sometimes your
grandmother's at 80. but basically the
indoor temperatures very very similar
from from Texas
to DC very similar and yet I saw so many
people tweeting on this point and yet
you had to wait for me to point out the
most important fact of the story
indoor temperatures very similar very
similar wherever you go indoors
all right
I have mixed feelings about using the
immigrants for political stunts it is
both
creepy and immoral and unethical
and it's working
so what am I going to do with that
right if it keeps working
you know who knows if it's working but
it but it does look like it's changed
the debate
that's what they're trying to do all
protests are uncomfortable for people
who are not part of the protest
so like that's what protests do they
impose pain on people who weren't part
of the protest
and and if it's a little bit of pain
we say that's part of the process all
right you know because we want the
public to be able to protest we want the
public to be able to push the government
when they need to so so when
when a protest and I would call this a
protest it's government on government
protests but it's a protest
um I would call it a protest if a
protest puts pain on people who are who
are innocent
unfortunately that's what protests do
you know when the protesters block the
street
you can't get back to your house for
five hours but you don't die
is in you it wasn't your fault you were
just trying to get home so
I don't know I I think in terms of what
is standard in America
we do put pain on the innocent people
this is like a
it's an example that you can't feel
comfortable with because it's the uh the
least powerful people you know the
people who are in the worst situation
who are taking the but on the other hand
what exactly were they used to
do you think they had a worse day in
Washington DC than they had in any of
their days prior to that was that their
bad day
probably not it was probably a day they
were warm and fed and hanging out with
people who spoke their language and
figuring out where they were going to be
they were probably saying to themselves
we're 95 to our destination
don't you think
we're 95 successful this is going well
and we're eating we're warm and I and
pretty soon I'll have a plan for where
I'll be
next week it'll have a job
I know
I will tell you one thing that you
should not get lost
you know don't lose this in the story
you know losing the forest for the trees
How brave are the people who are coming
here
crazy isn't it have you ever like put
yourself in their shoes How brave would
you have to be to make that trip without
knowing exactly how you were going to
make it all work you'd have you'd have
to trust that you could figure it out
along the way
it's just it's insane the level of
bravery
so I say again just to be clear I like I
like solid
borders
I I think I think we should be able to
keep a mosquito out of the United States
but separately we should have some kind
of an economic bipartisan group that
figures out how many people to let in
under what conditions and I'm not sure I
know the number I mean it might be 2
million is the right number
I would be completely non-surprised by
that you know if actual legitimate
bipartisan people said you know we kind
of need 2 billion a year
that's entirely possible maybe not the
exact mix that's another question but we
probably need about 2 million a year
that might be what we need
I don't know I'd like to hear experts
talk about it
but
the one thing that I'm not concerned
about is the quality of the immigrants
and again I I have a I have an advantage
point because I get to see that
Community all the time they're awesome
people you want more of them not fewer
all right there is something very good
happening in the Sentinel World it looks
like the free market with some charity
involved a non-profit are going to solve
what the government is largely ignoring
which is fentanyl overdose yeah there's
a pharmaceutical non-profit that got
some kind of priority review which means
the FDA will will look at them quickly
uh for this next alone drug that you can
spray up somebody's nose if they had an
overdose
now right now you need depending on
where you are you might need a
prescription that's not true everywhere
but it's like a hundred dollars without
insurance
yeah so Narcan right now would be a
hundred dollars
without insurance how many drug addicts
are going to spend a hundred dollars
for Narcan
just in case
right it's sort of Impractical and and
also how many people are going to have
it just in case somebody they know needs
it like would you buy a hundred dollar
item just in case a stranger needs it
someday
some would and some did I know some
people did actually Carrie but
but they can get the price down to I
think to 18 dollars so it'd be almost a
non-profit situation so at 18 and it's
not an injection right it's not a needle
you you literally if somebody's just
laying there in a passed out you just
stick it up their nose and pump it a
couple times done apparently it works
well
so yeah so for 20 you know under 20
bucks with I don't know if there's tax
or whatever but for 20 bucks
everybody's going to have one
like there's no way I wouldn't have I
would have two or three in my house at
twenty dollars and no uh you know easy
availability and no prescription I'd
have two or three
I'd keep one in my car
and I keep one in my garage
and the one in the garage would be in
case a neighbor needed it and I'm not
home because I can open my garage
remotely
so um so take my neighborhood for
example my neighborhood is super wired
um if anything happens anywhere in the
neighborhood a a WhatsApp alert goes out
and everybody in the neighborhood
everybody in the neighborhood goes who's
doing what all right let me take a look
at this and everybody's on the street
like looking for the perpetrator you
know we're all looking at our security
cameras from like 15 angles and you
come into my neighborhood we got a
picture of you we got a lot of pictures
of you if you're in my neighborhood so
but imagine if you will
the the alert goes out and it says
there's an overdose at this house does
anybody have this stuff and I'm on
WhatsApp I go yes I do I'm not home
garage door just opened
and somebody can literally run you know
two houses down run into my garage where
I tell them it is grab it run back and
save a life
so basically I could control you know
with it with the systems that we have in
our neighborhood I could control a
maybe a like a five block radius
and keep people alive within my five
blocks like I can I can own that you
know as long as somebody in the
neighborhood sends out the WhatsApp
the drugs there five blocks so I I can
own that five blocks
so yes that's we'll work on that
um
that's good news
but it keeps telling you how how bad our
government is that the private you know
private Enterprise had to figure this
out and a non-profit
um
here's a question uh Rasmus and S
Rasmussen polling
they were asked American people were
most likely to vote to Americans
identify America's greatest enemy
nearly four to forty percent of the
voters did not choose a foreign power
[Laughter]
now obviously the biggest foreign powers
they chose were China and Russia
but internally
uh
internally uh
uh let's see
22 percent of U.S voters say that
Democrats are the nation's biggest enemy
not China not Russia but Democrats and
17 percent say the Republicans now does
that match does that match the media
coverage
if you believe the media wouldn't you
believe that the public thinks
Republican that Republicans are the
Dangerous Ones
but according to the poll
the public thinks Democrats are the
Dangerous Ones that is totally opposite
of the news is it not
don't you get that same feeling that the
news is all about the right-wing
extremists and the Republicans but when
you ask the public
they're like Democrats look pretty
dangerous to me
yeah now all of the answers around are
around one quarter so that doesn't work
for this one
um
but here's the most interesting part
um
if you asked how many well the people
who said that Russia was the biggest uh
threat
uh 31 of Democrats say Russia's biggest
threat but only 12 percent of
Republicans
so a huge difference between Democrats
and Republicans and who they say is the
foreign threat
um
the Republicans say China
35 to Democrats 16. like big difference
right so Republicans think China is a
problem and Democrats think uh
um Russia is the problem
why why
now we understand why Democrats and
Republicans disagree on domestic stuff
because on domestic stuff
they just revert to the team so there's
no reasoning going on but why would why
would there be a difference
between
the parties because we're all looking at
the same stuff aren't we
yeah so it's probably a trump effect
probably a trump effect right because if
they think Russia likes Trump then they
don't like Russia
uh and it's also a trump effect because
Trump is tougher on China
than on Russian
so it makes sense Trump convinced a lot
of people that China was the bigger
thing
is there any influence you're forgetting
is there anybody let's say besides Trump
who Republicans would be more likely to
listen to
the Democrats and who may have been
telling you that China is the biggest
threat
yeah Tucker Carlson
and me
now I call it the Scott effect
because I did set out to
change the public opinion exactly the
way it has changed but Democrats don't
listen to me so whatever influence I had
was probably on one side
now I I don't know how to you like
unpack like who had the most impact it's
got to be Trump right but beyond that I
don't know
I just know that whenever I tell you I'm
going to do something it seems to happen
and even I don't know why like it looks
like
a coincidence
who knows
who knows
well ladies and gentlemen I believe this
brings us to the the end
of our prepared notes was there any
was there anything I neglected
how about your own eyes and ears don't
believe those
he's an MBA not an economist you talking
about me on both
of a degree in economics
um
did we find out if Pence is running or
not yeah there was some confusion about
that
maybe you filed but I don't know maybe
filing doesn't mean you're running
PSA about
Jesus being a refugee didn't see that
Scott our Intel agencies are our biggest
problem
that's reasonably likely
um
the Scout reframing syndrome
oh gratitude right thank you
so we're gonna we're gonna show some
gratitude
to uh people and things
anybody anybody have anybody that they
want to throw into the mix
is there anything that you feel a little
extra gratitude for let's say something
we would recognize the rest of us
uh what kind of
I've got the Clapton strato
your wife
uh the internet
well thank you I appreciate what you say
about me
all right well we appreciate each other
I'll take that as a given appreciate the
Constitution
uh I I'll join you on that one I'm going
to appreciate the founders of the
Constitution they did a hell of a job
like it's hard to imagine anybody doing
a better job on anything
than the Constitution it's amazing
um
Elon Musk about some appreciation for
Elon Musk
I appreciate the hell out of them
because I do think that he was he's
doing what he's doing for larger
purposes I don't think he bought Twitter
to make money like I really don't
so
huge appreciation for that will he be
perfect will he never make a mistake
of course not
but he's pretty transparent and I'll
take that
um
with a maple neck oh okay
oh
um thank you I'm glad I triggered some
improvements
um I would like to also show
appreciation for the independent
podcasters
who I think are saving us honestly
imagine what the world would be like
without the independent podcasters
it's it's that scary world because
everything we'd know would be sort of
coming from the news
that'd be terrible
yeah Joe Rogan again uh National
Treasure
Joe Rogan is willing to take the hits
and his National Treasure
about internet dads yeah have an
appreciation for the internet dads who
are trying to keep keep the world from
going off the rails right your Tim pools
appreciation for that
uh Viva
yep PD Henson Joe Rogan we mentioned yep
Lex Friedman cernovich Mike zinnovich
Naval Jordan Peterson yeah very Megan
Kelly Dave Rubin all very uh
Michael malice trigonometry yeah these
are great ones
all right I have to say one more thing
about Andrew Taylor Andrew Tate
so yesterday I saw one of his Clips
which he does brilliantly by the way
so if I ever if I ever suggest that he's
unskilled that that you heard it wrong
he has a lot of skill and he's he's
pulling it together in a very amusing
way
but one of the things he says is that
marriage is for idiots basically if
you're a man
if you're a man getting married is
basically just a sucker's play it's just
it's just stupid at this point
and I'm not saying that I'll agree with
that or disagree with it but he's
putting that out there and here's the
part that's interesting
he's not alone
it's one of the biggest emerging themes
on social media is that marriage doesn't
make sense for men
ever
it's just like a sucker's play
and nobody had been saying it directly
before
so so that's that's a value that Andrew
Tate is adding to the conversation just
because he says it directly now
just to be you know very clear here I'm
not saying you should follow Andrew
Tate's advice on anything
yeah I I like to point this out the
smoked cigars and drinks whiskey and
gives you health advice
I mean just
I don't know I mean I'm just observing
you do do whatever you want with that he
also gives a lot of relationship advice
but doesn't seem to be in one
so that's just an observation right he
seems to have multiple children uh but
not in any marriage situation
now how often does he see his children
well that's his business not ours right
totally his business but
you should at least be aware that the
people giving you advice may not have
solved their own problems
you just be aware of what you're who's
giving you advice
and by I would say the same thing for me
by the way if I ever give you a
relationship advice
you should throw it in my face
you you have full full authority to say
how'd it work for you Scott to which I
say Gabi
Gabby right
yeah so I'm not going to be a hypocrite
about that like if I could figure out
any of this stuff I'd figure it out and
then I'd share it with you
I swear I swear if I could figure out
how to make relationships work I I would
tell you
like I wouldn't keep that to myself I
would tell you but I don't think
anybody's worked it out and I think the
basic reason is that we did not evolve
to be in the steady state
that we evolved to be you know in
continuous transition where you're
eating you know eating your babies and
creating new babies and stuff like that
so we're not meant to find our happy
place and then just sit in the pocket
Were Meant To Be continually unhappy so
that we're scratching to get something
that'll make us happy it's how we move
forward
my relationship advice is the reason
you're happily married
well maybe I got lucky on that one maybe
I got lucky on one
no yay talk today yeah yay's been kind
of quiet
I'll talk about him if he gets
interested
have you banned any words in chat I
don't think so
to do
you got divorced
wait that didn't happen did it
did that actually happen
I can't tell if you're kidding
oh you're laughing right okay good
good just kidding
um
I I see questions about Christina but I
don't want to answer any personal
questions about her you understand that
right I'll answer personal questions
about me sometimes but I want to answer
a personal question about somebody else
so
so don't ask I can't answer those
questions
it's a guitar is a
strat Stratocaster
I I thought I would probably practice
better if I had a better guitar
are you saying Tate does not drink he's
a Muslim is that a recent thing
yeah anyway uh I I think I'm I'm going
to retire from the business
of criticizing uh an opinion person
because he's writing in his diary
all right it's electric electric guitar
uh I didn't see anybody
uh
non-christmas uh I just it was just a
day
so I did learn that it's the c word
apparently that gets me demonetized so
yesterday I got demonetized almost
instantly as soon as I used the f word
but then they reversed it pretty quickly
upon human review I think the ones that
don't get reversed is when I've used the
c word but I don't know if that trend is
100 percent
pattern or not
how are the drum lessons
locals people I was just asked how are
the drum lessons
do you think I have an answer for that
well YouTube
we're gonna play you out
thank you
[Music]
this is me and my drum teacher chairman
[Music]
[Music]
all right we get to the fun part fun
part's coming
yeah definitely Charlie Watts
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
foreign
so that's what uh 14 months of drum
lessons get you
once a week 45 minutes so that was my uh
that was my guitar slash drum teacher
who was jamming
now what you don't know is that that
wasn't an actual song that was just
that was just me practicing beats and my
guitar teacher can play along with
anything so I just laid on a bunch of
different beats and then he adjusts to
the beat and then we we jammed for a
while to do beat then I change the beat
so
I can't even explain to you how much fun
that was
I probably enjoyed so that was just
yesterday today I probably enjoyed that
two minutes
as much as I've enjoyed anything
non-sexual
my entire life
well you just watched two of the best
minutes of my whole life
and part of it is
uh I I've said this before I have insane
levels of just insane levels of planning
and determination
which has served me well and so from
probably the age of I don't know 10
years old
I wanted to be able to do that
like exactly that from the age of 10
years old
and couldn't do it until you know my
mid-60s
and I'll tell you a specific thing that
that sparked it
I walked into the uh the gym of my
little high school in Upstate New York
and they were preparing for
um a dance that evening and there were
some of the high school kids in my tiny
little town had somehow gotten
instruments and taught themselves to
play
so there was a band
that they were all self-taught they just
listened to records and said well do
this somehow they learned how to play
guitars and drums and the drummer who
was a new kid in town
uh Dave Huber
now I open I'll be still alive and I
hope somehow he sees this
David Huber
because I want him to remember uh in
case he remembers the moment
so so there's a bunch of high school
kids were Milling around in the you know
on the gym floor and the dance hasn't
started the dance will be hours later
but the band is just getting set up on
the stage where we can all see them the
drummer David Huber sits down in the
drums and starts playing
and he just starts like knocking out
this this whole drum solo and everybody
just like stopped
because we didn't know he had any Talent
right he wasn't like a good student or
an athlete he was just somebody who had
to play the drums really well and he
starts ripping out these drums and our
entire impression of him
I think as one changed
right because he was a new kid we didn't
know who he was we knew he wasn't an
athlete and we know he wasn't doing that
great in school
so that's what we knew about him and he
sits down in the drums and he just kills
it and
did he get laid oh yeah
after that day he did oh he did great he
did great enough for that day and
I had a moment
I I stood there in that gym and I said
to myself
someday I'm going to feel that
that whatever it is he's feeling up
there because he knew he knew he was
moving the whole room like he controlled
the whole room just by sitting down on
the drums and I said to myself I'm going
to be that guy
I want to feel what that was
and I just spent well over 50 years
trying to figure out how I could open My
Schedule enough that I could do that
just once
and that was it
you you saw the culmination of 50 years
literally 50 years to do that for two
minutes
how happy do you think I was yesterday
and still
like so happy
you you rarely get to to
you know achieve a 50-year plan I mean
that's pretty unusual there was now the
reason I had to wait so long is because
I was still drawing every day with my
hand
and I didn't want to do anything that
would you know first of all take a lot
of time but also I didn't want to ruin
my hands so now I'm semi-retired my art
director does the drawing for the
Dilbert comic
so yeah I thought a little little hand
uh resource available
anyway
so that's where that is and I'm I'm
taking up the guitar as well see if I
can have any progress there I'm up to
four chords
four chords played very slowly
with some of the strings not not
entirely making the right noise
much better now better than it was
and certainly my art director is better
than I am
which cords c g e minor and D
um
guitar may take longer than drums well
maybe but I'm told that if you can get
those four
four chords you can do a whole lot of
songs
so it might be that the guitar can get
me to playing faster but all you would
need to know for drums I'm pretty close
like the the total body of skill and
information about drumming I'm probably
80 there
but I'd be able to play entire songs on
the guitar being 10 there
does that sound right For You guitar
players
like I could play a song only 10 capable
the other 90 takes the rest of your life
with drums you can get to 80 in 14
months
and then the other 20 you know the rest
of my life
and a in a capo for other Keys Capo
yeah
um
try Walk Don't Run Stairway to Heaven
yeah that'll take a while
um
at the M27 what
all right
uh I bet you
now here's my theory about why musicians
get a lot of action
so this is related to something I've
said before I believe that everything
that we think and do and the way we act
as human beings is a projection from our
mating Instinct that everything you do
is because of some connection to mating
you know you might not be aware of it
but even the clothes you wear or sending
a signal the job you take basically
everything it's just amazing you know
projection
and that means that women
well it doesn't mean it but women I
think are evolved to spot uh
characteristics in men
that are
um that are let's say proxies for good
genes
so if you see somebody who's like tall
and strong you say oh probably good
genes somebody who's healthy somebody
who has good symmetry which we call
Beauty good genes
but if you see somebody who's an athlete
you say oh those look like some good
genes if you see somebody who's
unusually smart good genes but I think
musicians also project some kind of
uh at least mental and physical
capability
and and also ability to work hard
without immediate reward
you can't really be a musician unless
you're willing to put in a ton of work
without even an initial reward right
that's a very good indicator of future
capabilities very good
so I think that music you know I do it
because I think I like it like that's
that's how my brain works my brain says
oh you like the sound of Ed and it's a
challenge and all these things but I
don't think that's why I'm doing it
I I actually honestly believe that my my
base influence is just the mating
Instinct it's a way to show off
right and when I told you the story of
how I got interested it was literally
because I wanted to show off
like I I feel I'm very connected to my
mating Instinct because I never fooled
myself that my my higher level thinking
is guiding anything
like I always think my higher level
thinking is just rationalizations for a
 I wanted to do and the stuff I want
to do is just related to my mailing
Instinct either directly or indirectly
and um and by the way drumming
I believe also has a evolutionary
um connection
so here's another theory I don't know
how much uh Faith's put in this Theory
but there's a theory that uh drumming
and dancing had the same evolutionary
purpose
which was to make an individual person
who would be helpless compared to let's
say a lion or a big animal
if they're with a group and the group is
playing in Rhythm and they're moving in
rhythm and they're standing together
then an animal that sees that is going
to say holy that's one big animal
like I could take one one human easily
but I can't take this big group of
people and likewise if you agree to
attack another tribe
would you attack a tribe that could put
put on a musical show where they're
dancing to the Rhythm
because as soon as I saw that I'd say
um
they're coordinated I do not want to
attack anybody who's coordinated
right because that's that's a sign of
capability coordination so I think I
think drumming and dancing were always a
defensive
um
a defensive habit
and that we've come to love it so we
think we do it because we love it but I
think it's all it's all based on
self-defense which is ultimately related
to your mating Instinct because you're
you know there's no point in bathing if
the lion is going to eat your baby so
it's all related
uh
Scott on Dancing With the Stars that'd
be the worst
saying me on Dancing With the Stars
terrible idea
Bam Bam wants us to know uh quote I'm
not wearing underwear
thank you
appreciate that
all right
um
all right that's all for now YouTube I'm
gonna go talk to the locals people
privately and thanks for joining
