to do
good morning everybody and welcome to
what will no doubt be
the highlight of your life and of
civilization in general it's called
coffee with scott adams
is filled with content plus sipping and
today
the news has served up
delicious content
sometimes oh maybe better than you've
ever seen before it's the good stuff but
if you want to enjoy the good stuff even
more than usual all you need is a copper
mario glass a tanker chelsea's dino
canteen sugar flash a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine the day the thing
makes everything better we're going to
add a little oxytocin today
and it's called the simultaneous hip go
well i've been prompted by a comment
over there on
youtube
to remind you that sunshine is the best
disinfectant
sunshine is the best disinfectant
or as cnn likes to say it
don't drink bleach you idiot
that's their interpretation speaking of
fake news from cnn
um apparently there
everybody who is smart is predicting
that the u.s power grid
is going to have some serious trouble
this summer
and cnn is telling us what is the
the root cause
of the energy shortage to come
what do you think is the root cause
according to cnn of why there will be
short energy shortages electricity and
blackouts what what would be the cause
russia no no no not russia
climate change
climate change yes the that will be the
severe droughts because the temperatures
will be higher and there will be ongoing
droughts
i'm assuming the drought part has to do
with how much water can be released from
hydroelectric dams
presumably
so yes the problem is not that we've
under-invested
the problem is not that we're closing
perfectly good nuclear power plants too
early
the power is the the problem is not that
every single rule that has changed in
let's say california has highly impacted
state
goes against the interests of the people
in terms of keeping the lights on
no no it's climate change
cnn has the
balls
and we're going to be talking about
genitalia a lot today by the way
cnn has the balls to full-throatedly put
the entire blame of this on
climate change
now what would you do if you believe
that climate change was a problem
you would probably reduce the amount of
fossil fuels that you're using as
quickly as you could
thank you greta tonberg
and would that make the problem better
because you're working hard at solving
the climate change
would it
would that make the price of energy
you know go down and the availability be
greater
no
no no it wouldn't hello adam
and
so watch cnn try to turn the energy
crisis not into a
democrat governor's
destroying everything but rather it's
about the climate change
sounds like something that republicans
have broken doesn't it
yes the republicans have broken the
climate
which has a cascading effect
all the way to your electricity going
off in california
that is the narrative
that you will be
abused with over the coming year
well i have a question about governor
desantis
so governor desantis signed a bill that
will increase punishments for fentanyl
tracking
he is one of how many governors
50.
why is he the only one doing this
and
wasn't this free money
just sitting on the table
it's the biggest problem it's killed the
most people between what 18 and 49 the
leading cause of death
more than the pandemic more than
everything the leading cause of death is
uh overdose and fentanyl being the
biggest part of that
and so ron desantis
is acting directly on that problem by
you know he acknowledges that we have to
reduce the demand for it
so he's not ignoring the fact that it's
half a demand problem and half a supply
problem well maybe a 75 percent demand
and 25 supply but you have to attack
both
and so
he's saying yes got to do something
about the demand
but
we're going to do everything we can
about this supply
now what he has done and he said it
explicitly
is
instead of treating the dealer who gives
you an overdose level
as a dealer
you treat them like a murderer
because they are
if you're a fentanyl dealer you're
killing people
right unless you've sold it once to one
person and they lived
but if you're a regular fentanyl dealer
you're killing people you're a murderer
and so
desantis the only governor who's figured
out that that's murder
you know changes the laws to increase
the penalties
consistent with the fact that it's
 murder
right it's murder
so
here's my question
am i the only one who thinks that every
time ron desantis does anything
he makes all the other politicians look
like chimpanzees
is it just my imagination or does he
just one time after another
hit the right note at the right time
it's like he's composing the symphony
where every note is right
and he's competing against people who
aren't trying
he makes the other leaders look like
they're not trying
and i don't mean that
in hyperbolic terms
actually literally
with no exaggeration whatsoever no you
take the politics out of it and by the
way do i agree with everything that ron
desantis wants to do nope
nope i want to be very clear i'm not a
fan of his specific policies in every
case right some i like some i don't so
i'm picking and choosing i'm not like
team desantis give me your policies
right same with trump
there was a lot that trump did that i
liked which i said loudly and often but
there were a whole bunch of things he
did that
i don't think we're
you know first-rate
so i'm going to say the same thing about
desantis right some stuff didn't like
and i've said
but overall if you were just to evaluate
him on a skills basis
forget about policy because that's more
has to do with your political leaning
but just skill
i'm going to say that there's nobody in
his
class anymore
he's basically operating completely
alone
there's nobody in his class
that the next best governor would have
to be competed
compared to other people
that's how bad it is
the second best governor whoever you
think that is shouldn't even be compared
to them because they're not in the same
weight class
it's like conor mcgregor
you know great great fighter right
but if you put him against the
heavyweight champion of the boxing world
you know that's a mismatch so it doesn't
matter how great your little governor is
if they're a completely different weight
class at this point
desantis is completely alone
in that class of leader
that even if you don't like the policies
the class of leadership is completely
alone now there's not a republican
there's not a
there's not a democrat
in that category
now here's what's interesting if you're
looking for trends
there's another person who could be this
person who's michael schellenberger
running for governor as an independent
in california
now shellenberger
like desantis a completely different
political animal right they're i'm not
going to make a comparison in terms of
their policies
but in terms of effectiveness
completely alone
schellenberger running for governor
is in a class by himself
and whoever is the second best candidate
let's say let's say is newsome
he's not in the same class
they're in a completely different weight
class
all right newsome is a middleweight
shellenberger is a heavyweight he's
coming in with fully developed
specific policies for all of the biggest
problems in california exactly the
things that we need fixed
what what does ron desantis do
that puts him in his own
class he solves problems
as they happen with the most rational
approach available
does it publicly shows his work it's a
whole different class
right that's what schellenberger is
doing with the specificity of his
solutions
so
there might be something good happening
here if you saw both of them win
and you know desantis will win but
imagine if you ran for president
and won
now that depends on what trump does i
think mostly but suppose it happened and
then suppose sheldenberger wins in
california
those two points
of people who just
decided to lead
and just do what the public needs and
wants and do it in some rational way
they're really going to stand out
and then they would start getting
imitators
and that's what you want
you want the imitators to say whoa did
that work
are you telling me that doing good
policies that
make sense and have worked in other
places are you telling me that that gets
you elected
just think about how close we are
to the best thing ever
the best thing ever would be to have
good leaders
because we have everything else
think about that thought i'm going to
say it again
the best thing that can happen in the
united states is that we would figure
out
how to elect good leaders
and we're almost there
if both of those candidates succeed
let's say to the next level
let's say hypothetically desantis
becomes president
hypothetically schellenberger becomes
governor of california they would have
proved
that being a
a good leader who has
good ideas
gets you elected
at the moment that is not the case am i
right
at the moment getting elected means to
being the most outrageous the most
uh provocative saying the craziest
things and getting your base all worked
up
and the and the reason that that's been
the way is that nobody could figure out
a better way
the best they could come up with
is exciting their own base
and then we we decided that was all you
can do
how many times have you heard the talk
of trump
and say okay okay he's not going to get
any democrats
but he's going to excite the base so
much that that's good enough to get him
elected it didn't work this last time
for who knows why
but what if what if that logic has been
killing the country because it has been
don't you think that the political
consultants
have been telling our leaders no no
don't say smarter things nobody likes
that
say whatever just gets the most
attention and it's like red be for the
base
don't you think
that the advisors are all telling the
politicians to do
bad things to get themselves elected
it feels like it it feels like the
shelling burgers of the world just said
well what if i don't
like what if i don't do this stupid
thing
to excite some base to get elected what
if i run as an independent
write two best-selling books about
exactly what to do
about our biggest problems
how about that
how about that
all right
you voters
californians in particular
and then perhaps you know later if
there's a desantis devote four for a
national office
you get to decide
if the country will be run by people who
have ideas
that may not always be the right idea
but you can try them see what happens
right and adjust but do you want a
country run by leaders who have ideas
that sound pretty good
or people who want to excite the base
and you get a choice
you get a choice
now i don't know if anybody can see past
their party affiliation to decide how to
get to the golden age but let me say it
again
we have everything
except
leaders in charge
like a michael schellenberger
and for president somebody like a
desantis
we have everything but that
imagine if we got that too
seriously
imagine if we got the last part
leaders who actually knew how to
you know implement things that are
common sense definitely will work
right
yeah it's all we need and it's close
if if both of those elections were won
by the
the the most competent leader
we'd be
we would have developed a
basically basically would be like
running the four minute mile
you know before anybody ran a four
minute mile it looked like it couldn't
be done but as soon as the first person
did it you know lots of people could do
it because the psychological barrier
fell
actually i think that's a fake story i
think just the training improved
the whole thing about the
four-minute mile psychological barrier i
don't believe anything about that
i think just that the technology of
training got better
and somebody was gonna run the four
minute mile pretty soon and somebody did
i think that's all it was really
but uh
but i like using it as an example anyway
so if these guys get elected it could
change everything
so
speaking of people who are not even
trying let's talk about that
um
nbc news is is coming down hard on
hunter biden
which is a big story
it's not a story that's something about
hunter biden that's part of the story
but the story is that nbc is doing it
do you know who nbc is
that they are the entity most associated
with
the intelligence agencies and the
democrats
so they have been
allegedly
carrying water for the cia and for
democrats in particular
and if you see them
spinning a story
you have to assume that it's the new
preferred narrative from the left
right now cnn does the same thing but
nbc is like even deeper and darker
according to his critics you know i
don't have any i don't have any special
information about nbc so i'm just
talking about what what people say about
them
uh the the glenn greenwald's in
particular who watch this stuff
so if nbc news is coming down on hunter
biden that's telling you that somewhere
at the top of the democratic leadership
they've decided that joe biden should
not be president much longer
am i right
would everybody agree with that
assessment
that if nbc news is coming and it looks
like the gloves are off they're coming
at him very directly and they're not
hedging at all at all
they're basically saying he's a criminal
it may not be illegal but but
criminal-like
i'll say criminal-ish without
necessarily being illegal
uh
and it's so direct
and they back it up with you know their
sources which is the laptop mostly
so
um apparently
hunter earned 11 million dollars
over a five-year period
um
doing deals with
barista and some
yeah and some chinese businessman who's
accused of doing terrible things
so and it's not clear what he did for
any of that and then there were some tax
issues that they had to pay after the
fact and stuff
but the fact that um and then there's
the clip of joe biden
dad
saying and they he actually said in his
debate with trump he denied that
hunter biden ever did any work for i
think the chinese is that what he said
just a complete lie about his son just a
total lie
and
this issue was probably big enough that
if had been reported correctly it could
have changed the election
so
and then
gop congressional sources say
that if republicans take back the house
this fall they'll demand more documents
and probe whether any of biden's income
went to his father president joe biden
is there any doubt
that some of hunter biden's income went
to his father
i feel like i feel like the
emails say that directly
now they're talking about specific deals
on the 10
so it could be that not not one dollar
of this 11 million went to his father
that could be
but do you believe that
it seems to me that
their business model was established
that the big guy gets
gets a taste
now again that doesn't make it illegal
yeah there's just a million ways that
you can do things that skirt the law
because if you're a family member
it's not that unusual that family
members
finance other family members
right so if if hunter biden made a big
score and bought a house or something
for his father
you wouldn't even think that was unusual
because families do that stuff i mean
i've
you know helped my parents get a get a
florida house etc so it's very normal
that families move lots of money back
and forth for less reasons
so that part might not be illegal or at
least you won't be able to find the
specific you know link to what hunter
did
all right here's the next in the uh not
even trying category
um twitter has a
head of what they call their crisis
misinformation policy
so it's one individual
who's uh
working on labeling
misinformation that appears on twitter
so if there's i guess if there's a
crisis only if it's a crisis situation
then they'll get more aggressive about
labeling misinformation
and
as chuck ross reports in the washington
free beacon
the person they picked this
fellow named roth
here are some of the things that he has
in his background
he doubted the hunter biden laptop story
he said there was no credible evidence
that uh it was hacked or whatever
and
uh and in 2020 on twitter he referred to
trump officials as quote actual nazis
he also called senate minority leader
mitch mcconnell quote a bag of farts
okay i thought for a moment i was going
to turn against this guy
but then when he got the part where he
he called
senate minority leader mitch mcconnell
bag of farts i said
okay
okay
if you can be that funny
i'll give you any job you want
you can even be a conspiracy theorist
in charge of the misinformation policy
i'll even let you have that
as long as you keep making good jokes
i'm all for it
yes mitch mcconnell does remind me of a
bag of farts i'm sorry
it's not political
it's not political
it has nothing to do with mitch
mcconnell's performance it has nothing
to do with the policies he has promoted
he just does remind me of a bag of farts
and if i'm going to be honest i have to
give this fellow some credit
this mr roth so good on you for that
but the ridiculousness of having
somebody with his background as the
crisis misinformation policy person is
wonderful
you know at some point it gets so
ridiculous that it's more funny than
okay turtle's good too it's more funny
than
bad
all right
shall we get to the big story of the day
are you ready for the best spin
on the biggest story of the day
i'm going to talk about
the elon musk accusations
and it will be the best thing you heard
all day other people will talk about
this
but nobody will do it as well as i'm
about to do it have i oversold it
well let's see let's see if i can make
good on that claim
so the claim is there's a
flight attendant
for the i guess the private jets that
elon rides in his own company spacex and
apparently one of the flight attendants
learned to become a masseuse
so that elan could get a
massage
while he's flying
now we always hear about how hard he's
working
but you don't hear about the fact that
when he travels he's being massaged in
his private plane
when i travel
i'm doing okay
i'm still sitting in a little seat and
i'm uncomfortable
so when i work
and i go on a business trip
i'm working
it hurts
i'm in pain
i'm crunched up i'm not eating right i'm
not sleeping right i'm in pain
but apparently elon musk is uh
putting everybody on his schedule so he
doesn't have to get up or go to sleep at
a particular time so he has meetings at
10 o'clock at night and
probably oh god 100 in the morning
and he's getting massaged on his private
jet on the way to a meeting
now if that were the way i worked
i could work 18 hours a day under those
conditions
you would just need you know your
private jet and your private
masseur but this
woman who had been a flight attendant
converted to
flight attendant
massage therapist
is accusing elon of whipping out his
member
and asking for more
and then he allegedly allegedly will
talk about how true this is allegedly
he offered her a horse because she had
some kind of equestrian hobby
and eventually there was a 250 000
payoff by the company
to make her story go away
now as others have pointed out 250 000
is sort of like
is nothing like an admission of guilt
it's more like just making something go
away at that level it doesn't really say
anything about guilt
elon musk has completely denied the
story
completely denied it but here's the fun
part
more than one
prior to this accusation musk had
tweeted
that
on
in march of 2021 so over a year ago
or almost a year ago he said if there's
ever a scandal about me
please call it elongate
elongate
and then when this scandal broke he
tweets
finally we get to use elongate a scandal
name it's kind of perfect
okay
has anybody ever handled a scandal
better than that
all right if that's the only thing he
had done
if the only thing he'd done is branded
his own scandal
it would be the best that anybody had
ever handled the scandal he knew it was
coming
he pre-branded it to make it funny and
then because it's funny
the branding of it and it's coming from
him
it's hard to think of the accusation
because the way he treated it is so
funny
you can't beat that
now does anybody think that you could
top that
could is there any way to handle a
scandal of this nature better than that
no you're all wrong you're all wrong
there is a way to do it better than that
and i think he did it
this will be the only place you're ever
going to hear the following thing are
you ready for it
so then elon musk
tweets this
there's going to be a standing ovation
coming
i hope all of you are ready to help me
because what you're about to see
is maybe the best thing
i've ever seen
in my whole life
so you think that naming his scandal
elongate before they name it
you think that's good
you haven't seen anything yet
and let me say this
he didn't become the richest person in
the world
by luck
it turns out he has some game
watch this
he tweets the following
having denied that anything like this
accusation happened he says the
following in a tweet
but i have a challenge to this liar who
claims their friend saw me quote exposed
describe one thing
anything at all scars tattoos dot dot
dot that isn't known by the public
she won't be able to do so because it
never happened
now
is this why i say
it's the best thing that ever happened
is this why that he actually
challenged somebody to describe his
intimate parts
in a tweet
now i'm not done yet hold on
i'm not done
and i said to myself
i can think of a couple reasons you
might do this
the first reason i thought is well maybe
she can't do it
and then you know maybe there's
something that he has a tattoo or
something i thought this is a good
strategy
because she won't be able to describe it
in an accurate way
and then i thought
i need to tweet something or no i need
to search for something it was just a
wild thought in the back of my head and
i thought
i wonder
is this just a clever play
or is it the best thing i've
ever seen in my life
and i needed to know
and so i google searched for
the size of elon musk's
and i found
on a top search
that his girlfriend grimes
apparently in public has described his
as very large
do you see it yet
elon musk
the richest man in the world
just got the entire world
to figure out what it is that could be
special or different something that the
public would not be necessarily aware of
there would be an identifying element
of his intimate parts
and he already knows the answer
it's huge
he actually did this
may we may we can we take a moment
would you join me in a standing ovation
would you
please please
[Applause]
and a simultaneous
for
the best reaction to a public scandal
of all time
go
now when
elon musk challenged her to describe his
intimate parts i i tweeted i i wonder if
this contest is open to the public
because i have some ideas i mean i don't
have a first-hand
uh knowledge but
i'm just going to go with a guess and my
guess was this i i think that uh
that when musk is in what we'll call the
elongate phase of his excitation
uh that he's somewhere between a falcon
9 and a
a falcon
xx
design now if you've seen these rockets
there's there are charts
of all the different rockets the past
and future and they're all slightly
different shapes they're all of course
phallic shaped
but as i had to guess
probably somewhere between the falcon 9
and and the uh the falcon heavy
something like that
that's just a guess
i know i i stress that i'm not speaking
from experience
all right um
speaking of uh people who have had
sex with elon musk the amber turd trial
uh continues and apparently amber turd
is in trouble
with uh australian immigration because
in an unrelated case to the
stuff she's in the news for apparently
she tried to smuggle her dogs into
australia during the pandemic
and she lied on a forum that she didn't
have anything to declare
now let me tell you something about
people who have been diagnosed
with the psychiatric or personality
disorder
the amber turd has been diagnosed with
so that i think it's that category b or
two or whatever it is where you've got
the borderline personality and it's sort
of like
a vulnerable narcissist and it's sort of
like
hysterical something so like three
different names but they're all in that
same area
if you're in that category
you don't just lie about
your boyfriend
or your husband
you lie about everything
all the time
the people of that category just lie
about everything they just can't turn it
off it's just
lying all the time
so do you think that she lied on an
immigration forum to get her dog into
australia
well i don't think so
cl cluster b is what it's called yeah
the cluster b personality disorders
when you're in there you lie about
everything so
would you believe anything she said on
the trial
if you know she's been dead she's
actually been diagnosed
as a personality type who lies about
basically everything
how could johnny depp ever lose this
thing
when he's competing against somebody
who's diagnosed by experts as a person
who lies about everything
everything
who knows the jury could do anything but
it should be an easy case
all right rasmussen has a poll
if a generic
republican ran against a generic
democrat in the midterms who'd win
and the gap is widened
so it's going from an eight percent gap
to nine
uh 48 would vote for the gop
generic candidate over 39 for the dems
but that is misleading
isn't it
it's misleading
because
everybody thinks that their incumbent is
the good one
yeah it people can say yeah generally
speaking
you know that i might vote for a
republican but when it comes to the
actual vote for their actual state
they're going to say oh
well mine is good i think other people
should get
different public you know different
politicians but mine's good i'll keep in
mind
so
don't get too excited about these
generic numbers because people don't
vote generically they vote for specific
people
all right
let me ask you this general question
apparently this uh getting back to this
elon muslin the allegation comes not
from the
woman who is apparent who is allegedly
but we have strong denials the victim
how often do women lie to their good
friends about a sexual encounter with a
man
how often
do good friends women
lie
about even to their good friend
about exactly what a situation with was
with a man
how many times have i experienced a
female lying about her relationship with
a man
to me
just in the last year maybe
six to ten times
yeah probably probably six to ten times
just me personally
in a variety of contexts right
different people
have told me you know blah blah blah
this was my relationship only to later
say well i left something out
that completely reverses the story
right
all the time
the
women i don't think women understand
maybe they do i don't know
how often their best friends lie to them
about their sexual activities
it's pretty common
and people kind of shade the story the
way that makes them look good to their
friend
yeah it's probably closer to universally
lying
than you know more often true than that
now let me let me put it this way
suppose you heard that there was a story
about just an ordinary person
and they were being accused by another
ordinary person of some kind of sex
impropriety
what would be your first thought
one unknown is accusing another unknown
of a sexual
crime
you'd probably think it's true not
necessarily
but you'd probably say
that's 75 probably true because it's the
person who is involved
and you know people don't make up
accusations all the time
you know so you'd say well probably true
maybe not but probably true
but what happens if you have a
billionaire
and the accusation comes not from the
person who is directly involved
so it's a billionaire
male
and the accusation is coming from the
friend
of the alleged victim
what is the level of credibility you
would put on that situation
let me give you some context
how many times do i person i scott adams
how many times have i been accused of
sex crimes from people i've never met
quite a few times
it happens all the time if you're a
public figure getting
falsely accused of sex crimes by people
you literally haven't met
is a routine situation
routine right
so if you give me a single billionaire
and the accusation comes not from the
alleged victim but from the friend of
the victim who you know heard only lies
because sort of that's the way it works
that's the lowest credibility you could
ever put on an accusation
yeah the timing of the accusations is
right when you expect it to happen
so right on schedule wouldn't you say
and we've got a new endorsement for uh
speaking of michael shellenberger
running for governor in california
stephen pinker
just fully endorsed him
there's a pattern
the californians who are endorsing
shellenberger
are the smart ones
like the ones that everybody agrees is
smart
right stephen pinker you could disagree
with him or you could agree with him but
nobody's going to argue
that you know he's not smart like he's
extra smart
so if you look at the people who are
endorsing
shellenberger they're not the normal
people
they are they are the
they are the dads of california if i
could put it that way
they are the smart ones
and that's not a coincidence
because the smart ones are saying wait a
minute you could actually solve these
problems
as soon as you step out of the political
frame
we have all kinds of solutions
and you have to have a certain amount of
intellectual
let's say firepower
before you can even entertain that
possibility
wait there's a candidate who can step
out of the narrative
and just
work on what works
apparently there is
maybe for the first time
so
watching who is endorsing him
is
is really interesting because these are
just not the normal people these are the
people who
can see the solution they can smell it
and they they think he's onto it
as i do
all right um
can he win
the answer is yes
if
the the key to schellenberger's win is
to get into the runoff
in other words he's got to beat the
weaker candidates behind newsome to get
into the top two
if he gets to the stop too then i think
it's time then we're going to see them
side by side on a debate stage
if you see them on a debate stage
schallenberger is is going to
annihilate newsome
it's going to be a slaughter
so yes there's a very direct way for him
to win he has to get in the top two very
doable
and then he has to debate very doable
and then he has to win
almost guaranteed
i mean you're we're talking about
and by the way newsom is good
newsom is a good debater he didn't get
where he is by luck right he's very
talented so he hasn't been a good leader
for california but as a politician
one of the best
if you're just looking at the political
skill not the not the guest stuff done
skill
but if you put him on a stage with
somebody like sheldon berger who
actually has the receipts
it's just going to be a bloodbath
so yeah
he has he absolutely has a path but he
has to get past the first hurdle of
getting getting into the top two
um
it's rigged you say
uh have i voted for
you know i'm not a big voter
uh where's the schellenberger smear job
it's funny the closest they came to a
smear job ended up being a compliment
that's about it
you know i assume everybody's got some
some stuff they're going to have to
explain
but i haven't seen it yet
um
well oh will he be the new face of white
supremacy i doubt it
because that's the other thing that
sheldon berger has going for him he
doesn't have some history of talking
about woke stuff one way or the other
it feels like it just hasn't been on his
radar
which is exactly what you want right you
want somebody who hasn't even been drawn
into that conversation that's what i
want i want somebody who didn't even
know what happened
that would be going too far but
um
so you say scott has a romantic notion
that california can make it out of this
i do
because i think the
the law of slow moving disasters
has been very consistent
and
while california is heading directly in
the wrong direction
we do have enough time
we do have enough time to to fix it
it's sudden shocks i worry about i worry
about pandemics
things you didn't see coming or at least
you know not everybody saw it coming
monkey box is starting to rise and it
feels like it feels like there's no way
to stop this monkey pox thing
because
independent of the science i just feel
like the news is going to make it the
next big thing and then it will just
become the next
big thing
does the adams law account for
irrational california voters yes it
accounts for everything
in the long run
we're really we meaning humans are
really really good at solving big
problems in the long run and no matter
the politics no matter anything
in the long run we have sold every
every problem that would have wiped down
civilization
we've sold them all
all right
and
i believe
i've done everything i need to do
would you agree that this is the best
show you've ever seen and that nobody
will treat the elongate scandal
as well as i did
can we all agree on that yes it's the
best ever
okay
and now
uh
they hid what his tweets from last night
really so there's an accusation here
that uh
the sum of elon's tweets were hidden by
twitter i don't know about that
but
tomorrow
maybe even better who knows i mean
you didn't think that today would be so
good didn't you
nobody knew how good it would be today
but tomorrow
could be even better you never know
all right
that's it for now i'll talk to you later
