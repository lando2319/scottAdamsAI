dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
possibly robot simple as a civilization
but it's too early to know
today will be a barn burner
there there will be a whiteboard a
whiteboard yes and uh single-sided but
still thrilling I think you would agree
now would you like to take your
experience up to levels that nobody's
ever seen ever
um yes you would and all you need for
that is a cup of Margaret a glass of
tank your chalices tie in a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
in with your favorite liquid
I like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
you know the day thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now go
ah
all right well I think you all all you
Americans know what tomorrow is
that's right
tomorrow will be the anniversary of
the death of John Adams President John
Adams
and Thomas Jefferson
little known fact Thomas Jefferson and
John Adams who had been great uh they
had done nemesis
but then they became friends in later
life
and allegedly
when was it when Jefferson was dying he
said Adams is still alive or was it the
other way around which way did it go
when Adams died he said Jefferson's
still alive
it was Jefferson said Adams oh Jefferson
still lives
and they died same day yeah amazing well
anyway let's talk about stuff
um
do you want to make me uh see if I can
make a billion dollars sound like a
small amount of money
watch this here here's the power of
contrast
normally if I said to you hey I'd like
to give you a billion dollars
wouldn't you think that was a lot of
money
you would right because you'd be con
contrasting that to what you already
have
I'm going to make a billion dollars
sound like not a lot of money now you
ready for this it has nothing to do with
Ukraine
um there's some estimates that the cage
match between Zuckerberg and Elon Musk
if it happened could charge a hundred
dollars per person for pay-per-view and
it would bring in over a billion dollars
just one billion
all right between the two of them
they're like worth 300 billion dollars
is there ever is there ever been a
situation where somebody was worth
combined 300 billion dollars fought for
one billion dollars that goes to charity
that it makes a billion dollars sound
like a small amount
wait wait are you telling me that Elon
Musk
is going to do a cage fight for only a
billion dollars
and it doesn't even go to him
all right well I just thought it was
interesting
so uh you know I always tell you that
the Summer Stories and politics are the
the really stretching it to make a story
out of nothing in order for a good
summer story it has to be a story where
there's no new facts
because the reporters are on vacation so
you want a story you could talk about
endlessly
but not have any facts so both sides are
going to do it right they're you know
the Democrats are going to talk about
Trump's documents that they don't know
what they are we still don't know what
they are but if if it was about this
it's bad you know the the if
so the Republicans have their own
version of that and so their version of
the summer story is that uh Joe Biden
won't recognize his own granddaughter
the the child of the stripper
which is a real messed up thing to say
I hate that that came out of my mouth
like I hate that I I hate that I
accepted the frame
let me can I chastise myself for a
moment
I just called I just called somebody's
mother a stripper
how up is that
I mean that might accurately describe
her her profession at some point I doubt
she's doing it now but I don't know
so yeah that's pretty that's pretty
messed up that's pretty messed up I
don't like when the news does it it's
descriptive
it's accurate it's just up it's
somebody's mother I mean if you're
talking about her in the context of
being somebody's mother
I know it's just wrong anyway so I I
fell into the same trap so I apologize
um
but let me show you the story
the story is that uh the Biden's Joe
Biden and Jill don't recognize the uh
can we say illegitimate the unmarried
daughter of uh you know one night of fun
between Hunter and
a woman who may have had stripping in
her past
so
and the story is that the the staffers
at the White House have all been
informed to say that Joe Biden has six
grandchildren and she would have been
the seventh so the story is that he's
ignoring
the grandchildren how could he not want
to hug her and include her and all that
stuff
now here's my question to you
knowing in advance that all stories
about public figures are fake all of
them they're all fake I know you don't
believe that but when I say fake I don't
mean that the details that are reported
are untrue
I mean that they're often reported with
a frame or a framing or some context
left out there's always something
important left out
don't you think there's something
important left out of this story I don't
know what it is
but there's something important being
left out
now it could be you know if you had to
speculate you know maybe there's
something about the mom
that if they if they mix it it just
becomes bearable but I don't that
doesn't really explain why you would
deny the existence of the child you
could simply not invite them to official
things
so wouldn't you say there's something
terribly missing in the story
because as written it doesn't make any
sense if you tell me if you tell me that
Jill Biden doesn't want to recognize
your own granddaughter
yeah I don't think there's any chance of
that
I'm sure she does
so there's something going on I'm just
going to leave it here
I'm going to leave it with there's some
fact about this that's just not true or
not being reported
and it could be that you know there's a
reason that the Biden's don't want to
tell us about it it might be something
that's
private or sensitive or creepy either
May there could be 50 reasons that they
don't want to talk about it
so that puts some that makes them
vulnerable so anybody else can frame it
the way they want because they're not
talking about it
anyway it's just a summer story and I
don't believe it's true and that's
that's the nature of all summer stories
they're not true or at least they're
framed in a weird way
all right
um ending affirmative action according
to polls was pretty popular this year's
a breakdown according to one poll
uh 75 percent of Republicans are in
favor of it
doesn't that seem low
that only 75 percent of Republicans are
in favor of ending affirmative action
only 75 percent
how could you actually be a Republican
and be in favor of it
it's almost like a
it's like a definitional problem of some
kind
anyway but 75 of Republicans
Independents are at 58 supported and
even a solid 26 percent of Democrats
approve of it
um
so that's a winner
now let me ask you this I'm no expert on
Supreme Courts and Supreme Court history
and stuff but can you answer this
question for me
with the affirmative action ruling have
happened the way it did
overturning it
if Trump had never been president if
Trump had lost in 2016.
are you sure it's no
because if he lost the conservative
judges would have been liberal judges
and and they would have kept it
right so is why is nobody calling this a
trump win
why why is the news not reframing this
as the one of the most popular things
Trump ever did
this is oh uh jacksopicus
right
so doesn't that seem like an obvious
oversight by the news
all right I remind you of my best
prediction right my best predictions are
the ones that are most contrarian
all right so this is a super well I
think it was contrarian actually maybe
it's not maybe this is not contrarian
because you might agree with me when
when Trump lost the election in 2020
I predicted that Trump would be seen as
a better president the longer time goes
by that the longer you waited the better
he would look
right
now look now look at the things that now
that we've waited
um
you know that I had I had an experience
with affirmative action it took me out
at least four of my career attempts you
know the four in a row I think
and
I was very happy that Trump did it I
mean you're confirming what I thought
that Trump was the agent of that change
that's huge in in my mind and in my life
it's really big
it's a really really big deal and it's
so big that unless Trump had started a
war
I would be happy if he only did that if
that's the only thing he did
I'd say he's one of our best presidents
um
so there's that
but what else did Trump get right
well let's look at how correct Trump
looks right now uh and I'm going to give
you one word
and then you tell me if Trump looks
smart and prescient all right one word
France
all right am I right
Trump warned us he warned us about
France he tried to stop it here
and he may have he may have actually
stopped it
because I don't I don't actually know
what the current situation is with
immigration
but we must be doing something right in
this country even even under Biden
what happened to Islamic terrorism
what happened to it
where'd it go
how in the world did it just stop in in
America in the Homeland
now I my speculation is that this the
what do you call it the uh
what do you call it when the security
state is spying on everybody the uh the
what do you call it statement what's the
word I'm looking for
it's like not the investigation the you
know what it is all right so the fact
that everybody is being analyzed is
surveillance the surveillance state
I figure is the reason we're not getting
um a huge terrorism problem I think I
think that the government actually is
sort of listening to everything and
probably using AI so it's not people
listening to us but I'm sure AI is
listening to all of our traffic
are you
wouldn't you assume that to be true by
now the AI is listening to all of the
traffic everywhere it's just picking out
the keywords and looking for terrorists
but it must be good at it it must be
good at it and I would imagine there's a
reason that's good at it
because AI is built on pattern
recognition
specifically language pattern
recognition but you don't think that
language pattern recognition could
identify a terrorist pretty quickly
I'll bet I'll bet that's one of the
easiest things it can do there's no way
that a terrorist talks like everybody
else they they would almost certainly
have a pattern to the way they approach
things so yeah and you know did did was
Trump behind that well that would be a
top top top top top secret thing but I
assume so
I assume so when he was in office and I
would assume that Biden's behind it too
and whatever they're doing
that's working because we're not friends
so I don't know so I assume that France
is you know wide open uh immigration is
what causes them all the problems all
right I'm going to give you one more
word
and you tell me if Trump gets the win
for a problem that you wouldn't have
caused
you crave
Ukraine
right now we don't know for sure we
don't know
but there but there's a reasonable
argument he could stop it soon and it
wouldn't have happened there's a
reasonable argument I'm not saying you
could know that for sure
um about uh this one's weird
is it my imagination or has the hysteria
about climate change
seem to be tamped down it seems to be
dampened lately
because the events in the world are not
are not supporting the data or the data
is not supporting the hypothesis as
smoothly as maybe it did in the past
now that doesn't mean it's not true
I'm not telling you the date is right or
wrong I'm just saying that the the
Zeitgeist or the way we're feeling about
it
is that I feel like this is just my
sense of the you know where the society
is at that we're just not as worried
about climate change as we used to be
for maybe a variety of reasons maybe
it's big improvements in energy
production might be that might be that
the we're in a period where it doesn't
seem to be getting hotter at the moment
and of course we're all driven by
anecdote so I mean you should know that
we could go 20 years without any warming
and Global and global warming could
still be totally valid you understand
that right
that over any 20-year period it might
not be getting any warmer
but after that period baby it gets extra
warm because there was some other might
have been some you know counterbalancing
thing that was going on for 20 years
but as soon as the counter balance is
gone then all the CO2 kicks in so so it
doesn't mean much that there's a 20-year
warming or a 20-year cooling either one
because that's that's too short a period
however
Common Sense tells you that if you add
20 years of increasing CO2
and the temperature didn't go up
I'm not saying that happened I'm just
saying that as we observe it we're
anecdotally driven
right humans are anecdote if you see one
example of something hey it's snowed
today I guess there can't be any Global
change or climate change
so it seems to me that the anecdotes
have became they have become unfriendly
to the climate change hysteria is that
true or not are you feeling that the
anecdotes are not and the data is not
supporting it like it used to
a little little uh more sketchy
scientific situation now that that would
work toward Trump's favor right if we
were in a like a serious frenzy about
climate change there's no way Trump
could win
no way
but in a world where everything
everything that the scientists and
experts have told us seems to be wrong
how has climate change look now
if we had never had the pandemic
wouldn't climate change look more uh
secure as a theory
it would because we'd be believing all
those experts wouldn't we uh well the
experts said so
experts said so I guess the experts say
so so what are we going to do we're just
unwashed citizens those those experts
but now that now that we basically don't
trust experts the entire climate change
argument
lives on one thing one thing
experts that's it the because you and I
can't penetrate climate change
right what did you do your own analysis
did you did do you have your own climate
change model no we have no access to it
we only have access to the experts
telling us stuff
so in a world in which all experts have
been discredited
2023
doesn't Trump look better than he's ever
looked on the topic of climate change
and not because he's right
I'm not saying that
I'm just saying that that where the you
know the energy is moving is very it's
very moving in this direction and
there's no way around that it's moving
in this direction
how about this one
what person I think I gave you this
statistic the other day which I don't
remember what percentage of the General
Public
thinks the 2024 election has a good
chance of being rigged
it turns out it's pretty high whether
you're a Democrat or a Republican or an
independent it's pretty high
right now does that hurt Trump or help
him
it helps them right because Trump is the
the experts have lied to you guy
that's who he is he's the experts are
lying to you let's figure out what to do
about it so
in a world in which all of us are
becoming convinced that the experts are
flawed way more than we understood the
guy who's been saying here for years is
looking pretty smart
so
if you put that all together France
affirmative action
Ukraine war climate change and then
trust in the elections
and then then you throw in energy policy
where Trump dominates
you throw in you know Biden's
embarrassment do you remember when we
used to say that we'd be embarrassed if
Trump went overseas and represented the
country
doesn't that seem funny now
we we would be embarrassed we were told
embarrassed as Citizens we'd be
embarrassed if Trump was the person who
represented us overseas
how's that feel now
it's 2023 we're sending Joe Biden's
decomposed bag of bones to represent us
you feeling good about that oh yeah
America's back we're back we got Joe
Biden over there tearing it up overseas
man do they respect that guy
oh they respect him so not like Trump oh
no no no they were just laughing at
Trump behind his back I'm sure they've
never laughed about Joe Biden behind his
back
no do you think Joe Biden has ever done
anything
that would cause an overseas leader to
to like chuckle a little bit when
they're drinking their tea with their
pinky how do they call just ever I think
so
so you could you could pretty much go
down right down the line of everything
that Trump was you know pillar pilloried
for is that a word I've never used
before
I've never used that word
pillory
I've read it I I think it fits does that
fit here
he was pillow read right like put it in
a pillar pillory
I don't know where that comes from
but he was pillow read let's say he was
pillory a very good word if you're at
home and you're listening to this
um go with your impulse because right
now you desperately want to say
pilloried out loud if there's nobody
around by your pet which is the way you
should consume this
yeah you can consume it with a pet
uh while jogging on the beach or even
boxing with your brother any one of
those things is fine but
say pilloried
all right you know you want to
all right here's the funniest tweet of
the week I'm giving credit to Ricky
Schlott who I think is a real woman
r-i-k-k-i Ricky
um but there's also a big story about
remember I told you a story about a
woman I wasn't sure she was real but
then she apologized I thought she was
now people are saying there was always a
bot
it's pretty disturbing because
anyway uh but this is a different story
so New York Times reported this so
here's a tweet from The New York Times
to build a diverse class of students the
medical school at UC Davis ranks
applicants by the disadvantages they
have faced the disadvantage scale helped
turn UC Davis into one of the most
diverse medical schools in the U.S can
it work nationally so that's what the
New York Times tweeted and then Ricky
schlot tweeted this
because everyone wants their brain
surgeon to be as disadvantaged as
possible
if I had a microphone now I would drop
it
I'm going to use my spare lavalier
plugin
drop
that's right yeah when I pick a brain
surgeon I'd like to know that they had a
really tough life
maybe you still have an attitude about
it
now
when I talk about reality and parody
merging
here's your perfect example
because what makes this funny is that
she didn't make anything up
that's why it's funny it's funny because
you can simply describe it in accurate
terms and it'll make you laugh
you can describe it in neutral accurate
terms
and it will still make you laugh
that's absurdity and reality merging see
if if it were just an absurdity that you
needed to make up some fun stuff about
it to make fun of it that would not be
reality in parody merging that's just
parody
but when you can just simply describe it
with ordinary words and it's hilarious
that's a problem that's too far that's
too far
um but I look forward to a time five
years from now when a highly qualified
black doctor will be
judged to be one of the best doctors
because otherwise how could you get
through that whole system
and uh I honestly I feel like black
Americans got a huge promotion
I don't think they they feel that way I
understand it because something is taken
away from them in the short term and it
definitely is
so they're losing something in the short
term
but what they're getting back
is respect
you only get one
and you made the right choice
you know what's weird
I want to see if I can get agreement on
this it's a weird observation
so white people have had this uh
interesting time lately with the
affirmative action ruling where we get
to sort of hide in the crack
and and we get to say well you know this
is sort of between you Asian Americans
and you black Americans and we're just
watching yeah leave us out of this you
guys you guys duke it out uh we'll just
call the plays as we see them but this
is not about us keep us out of this you
get you guys go wild hey you guys work
it out work it out we'll just go with
whatever you decide hey whatever you
guys decide that's okay with us we're
not part of this
but here's here's the thing I realized
the other day
yeah I was in a conversation uh recently
that was some class that had exactly you
know one or two Asian Americans in the
whole class and one of them was
valedictorian
right and we both laughed
it was just both laughed because it's
sort of you know uh stereotypical
now here's the thing
a hundred percent
I'm gonna I'm gonna make a exaggerated
claim but I want to say if you agree
with it or not
uh a hundred a hundred percent of white
people are completely aware that Asian
Americans kill us in academics
would you say that's true that a hundred
percent of white Americans are
completely aware that we're being lapped
in academics by Asian Americans all
right we agree now now here's here's the
trick question you ready for this
have you ever heard a single white
American say something negative about
that
ever
you have negative you've heard somebody
say negative about that seriously what
the state do you live in
in what state is somebody complaining
about Asian Americans doing really well
in school I don't believe that I don't
believe you've ever heard that
no and here's here's the thing
white Americans are just saying I don't
know why you know maybe it's cultural
maybe it's something else I don't know
why it's just a fact and the only thing
I feel about it here's my only feeling
about it
I'm sure glad they're in my country
I'm sure glad they're invite they're
inventing things for Americans I'm sure
glad they're my doctors right if I if I
see my optometrist and it's Asian
American
I think okay you did it the hard way
that's what I want
you studied I want you
but isn't it weird that we don't
you know I'm making a universal
statement that's clearly not Universal
but white people don't have a problem
with that
and I and you would think that they
would you you would think that at least
behind closed doors or in private
conversations people would say bad
things about that but it just doesn't
happen it just doesn't happen
I don't even know if that's important to
anything but I've never heard anybody
point it out
that when white people talk about Asian
Americans success we talk about it with
respect
the the one word that is universally
there's just respect okay you did it you
did it the way it's supposed to be done
boom all right
I'm going to show you a white board
that's associated with that in a few
minutes but a few other things I've
decided that what would be fun would be
um well let me start with some
background
those of you who have been in
relationships let's say you've been
married a long time I think you would
agree with this no matter
will get rid of Theron who doesn't know
that
you get hidden on this channel for all
caps
um
you've been in the experience where you
love your spouse
and you you love spending time with your
spouse but true or not if your spouse
had to do a business trip and be away
for a day
you'd kind of really enjoy that day
alone wouldn't you am I wrong even if
you love your spouse love spending time
with them but you know every now and
then you get that day alone it feels
great now the only reason it feels great
is because you still have a spouse
right it wouldn't feel great if you were
single necessarily because you'd be like
I'm lonely but as long as you've got
that person there even if they're on the
trip you're like oh I got the data do
what I want
so I thought I wonder if you could
create an AI girlfriend
who is uh
who you you you take to be your
girlfriend but she's always on a
business trip
she's just always on a trip oh you're
definitely married
but every day she'll call in a couple
times on Zoom say Hey you know just got
out of my meetings
uh I want to check in with you what are
you doing today and I wonder if I wonder
if the feeling that you're you know
you'd be pretending of course but the
feeling that you do have a spouse
they're just on a business trip
checking in with you I wonder if it
would make you feel better
I don't know this is a funny thought I
wouldn't take it too seriously all right
um Ukraine's uh big uh counter-offensive
uh it's racking up the gains let's say
according to CNN they've gotten uh oh
listen to this uh they've lost
tremendous casualties and lots of
military equipment but they do have
something to show for it Ukraine has
taken back nine square kilometers
wait one night night
square kilometers
they're having a whole War
to reclaim territory and the amount that
they've reclaimed I could walk
I could walk from one end to the other
of the entire territory they've
reclaimed
after how many losses what 50 000 dead
people
and they got back uh like a nice
baseball field sized area I mean it's
bigger than that but
right that's not good
you probably saw this story I didn't
know what to say about it but it's just
ridiculous so this will be another one
of those uh I'm going to just describe
something with just ordinary language
and watch how absurd it is I won't add
anything
this is just what actually happened you
do you know Jamil Hill
she's a woman who's very active in
saying things usually about Black
Americans and she thinks everybody's
racist that's sort of the summary
so she accused so Jamel Hill accused
Asians of quote carrying the water for
white supremacy for backing affirmative
action decision
Asian Americans carrying the water of
white supremacy
the the reason I didn't talk about it
even though it's been in the news for a
few days is that there's nothing to add
to it
right I like to add the absurdities of
the story but it's already there
like what the hell am I going to do with
that story
there's nothing you can do with that
it's it's complete
all right so I'll just tell you about it
and let it go
right there was a trump rally in a town
of Pickens
it says South Carolina there are only 3
400 residents but they've got 50 000
people to show up for the rally
3 400 people in the town
fifty thousand went to the rally
now
some are saying that the energy is
starting to favor Trump
it's starting to look like that isn't it
it started to look very much like that
now too early to make a prediction and
uh if you're joining me now I'm a single
issue voter so I'm backing Rama Swami
because he's tough on fentanyl so is
Trump both of them are tough on fentyl
um in terms of the Mexican cartels but
if it's a tie I go with the younger man
all right
um
there's some reporting that the Trump
veteran staff members are saying that
when Trump was allegedly holding up an
Iran attack secret document that we
heard about on the on audio recording
that he really was not holding up that
document because it doesn't really exist
and he was just bullshitting with the
reporters
I don't believe any of that
that doesn't sound true
I I don't know what was true and maybe
we never will
goodbye Don for over capitalizing
Don it was nice having you here but
you're gone now
all right uh so who knows about that
story
who knows
there's still talk of a third party
spoiler uh
spoiler for the election
do you think there'll be a serious Third
Party candidate
I think Cornel West is a third party but
not a big one
um and then the experts are saying if
there's a third party candidate that
would try to be a Centrist apparently
they're a Centrist group
what are they called
they have a name no labels a Centrist
group I couldn't think of their name
I couldn't figure out their name because
they didn't have good branding and the
name of their group is no labels it's
like maybe you should get a label
you know what would work really good in
this case when people can't remember the
name of your organization
a label
get yourself a label that would work
really well all right
um so here's the funniest part of that
the story
the experts who probably are right they
say that if this No Label Centrist thing
going it would take more from the left
than the right and it would guarantee
that Trump won I don't know if that's
true I suppose it would depend who that
Centrist candidate was
but I love the fact that everybody
assumes the Democrats are too dumb to
know that
that that's just assumed
that the Democrats presumably the last
thing they'd want would be a president
Trump so if they went ahead and voted
for this non-bidden third party they
would effectively just be electing Trump
now people people are acting like that's
just going to happen
and it might I'm not saying it won't
but
isn't it funny
that the only way it can happen is if
Democrats are so dumb they don't know
that they're voting against their own
interests in the most obvious way you
could ever vote against your own
interest it'll be all over the news I
mean long before you actually cast your
vote the news would tell you people
people listen to us on CNN if you vote
for that third party you are electing
Trump your worst nightmare don't do this
don't don't push that ballot see this
finger no don't do this finger thing
with that ballot that will make your
worst nightmare happen
and everybody assumes they're going to
do it anyway
[Laughter]
I don't have much to say about that but
it's just funny that no matter how
self-destructive a thing is you can
count on 25 of the public doing it
right yeah it's a terrible idea well
let's sign up 25 of the public they'll
do it how would you like to go to the go
to the Titanic in a in a under tested
submarine
25 of the public
sign me up
all right Dei is declining you can see
the signs everywhere d i is diversity
equity and inclusion
so it's forced on a lot of companies
through social and other forces but I
guess DeSantis is Banning Dei in Florida
and that means only in universities
because he doesn't have control of the
corporations right am I right about that
he's only Banning it in universities and
schools just universities right
correct you can't control the private
companies
then I saw at Wall Street Journal was
saying that the staffs of Dei
departments are
being cut
because if you hire less I guess the
hiring is decreasing if you hire fewer
people you don't need as much Dei
because they're trying to get their
diversity or something but that sounds
like an excuse to cut the Dei staff that
isn't giving you any profits
and then we're seeing uh who said this
this is also the Wall Street Journal
Laura agricar nasdaq's Global head of
diversity and equity and culture she
said that they're seeing a dip in the
interest of Dei so she's saying that the
energy around Dei is conspicuously down
ah
is that good or bad for Trump
well it suggests that the Zeitgeist is
moving in his Direction
if it were moving toward Dei that would
be a bad sign for Trump if it's moving
away from Dei and away from affirmative
action that feels like the public is is
shifting a little in a trumpian way even
if they don't know it
so I would say that all of the forces in
the world seem to be lining up to make
Trump your next president now
I promise you a whiteboard
whiteboard begins now
so I'm going to show you my take
on the affirmative action ruling and the
let's say the context of all of that
so here's how I see the world
and I would like as my gift to Black
America
to solve all your problems right here
all right
so the American success plan is usually
the same if you want to succeed you
first have to get rid of your obstacles
right if you have an obstacle to success
logically would you how many of you
would agree if you have an obstacle to
success and you want to succeed do you
not need to remove your obstacle first
yes or no
oh somebody says no interesting
interesting it's because you're way
ahead of me isn't it some of you say yes
we'll get to that all right so let's say
you've got obstacles you've got to get
rid of and let's say one of your
obstacles is systemic racism and
systemic racism could be connected to a
bunch of other problems you've got from
poverty to maybe poor nutrition you're
in a crime neighborhood too many drugs
Etc the ETC on this is doing a lot of
work
uh but you also if you if you can handle
your obstacles you can find a way around
them then you'd also have a strategy and
your strategy might be study
continuously build a talent stack you
know learn things all the time it's
always good for Success you'd want to
stay off drugs and obey the law and here
again the ETC is doing a lot of work
right you'd want to network you'd want
to you know there's a whole bunch of
things you dress right so there's a
whole bunch of things that we could all
name
that would be your strategies for
success now in my opinion and here's
where I'm going to get in trouble
it's great to have free speech if you
ever get a chance to have free speech
like I have that most of you don't it's
really awesome
it's a great feeling to be able to say
whatever you think is true and helpful
all right now I try to use my free
speech just to be helpful and this would
be an example right if you're an Asian
American
do you have any systemic racism
I'd say yes historically most people
would agree yes and do any Asian
Americans come over here with any
problems of poverty and bad nutrition
probably there are plenty of poor people
of all types Etc but in my opinion what
I see is that the Asian American
community
works on their strategies for success
and you know what that does
but what happens if you work on your
strategies and you ignore your obstacles
it removes all your obstacles it removes
your obstacles
because if you've got a really good
skill set nothing's going to stop you
nothing if you're not doing drugs you
stay down to jail and you developed
useful skills that the world wants
nothing's going to stop you no you're
you're soon will fix your own nutrition
your poverty will be fixed your systemic
racism might still be there but you
wouldn't even notice it you slice
through it like it didn't exist
so I believe that the the Black American
strategy for success is accidentally
backwards
accidentally is accidentally backwards
and I believe that we're being we all of
us are being sold an idea that if you
don't remove the obstacles to success
systemic racism being at the Top If You
Don't remove these black Americans are
going to be you know depressed and
suppressed because they won't have the
same level of success
Asian Americans do it the other way
around they get themselves right they
fix themselves
and then all this becomes irrelevant
so this is the biggest thing that black
Americans probably need to imitate
success is mostly imitation
imitation there's no there's no uh
there's no
there's no crime to be imitators right I
learned to be a cartoonist by imitating
other cartoonists right so imitation is
the way to succeed you look at other
people what did they do and then you try
to do that thing
and what works for every person
black
Asian American anything else Hispanic
American you name it what works for
everybody is this park you do this part
first
you don't ignore the obstacles you know
if there are people who want to be
working on those directly that's great
but if everybody did this you wouldn't
even talk about that it would just
disappear in time
right and that ladies and gentlemen
is my contribution to Black America I
believe that if every black American
took the free assets that are available
and I'm a perfect example I could give
you advice on how to do this right
I really could a lot of people could I
write books on it so you can buy my
books and you know how to fail to almost
everything and still win big tells you
exactly and in a pretty easy way
how to do the strategies right to
succeed
Black America
because I have freedom of speech I got
it the hard way but let me tell you if
you do this
work on this strategy first
the other stuff is going to disappear in
importance in a fairly quick period of
time
but if you work on the you know focusing
on the obstacles and you tell yourself
well there's no point in working on
myself because I got all these obstacles
you will be guaranteed to fail and
honestly it's going to be hard to care
it's gonna it's gonna be hard for other
people to care about you right do you
know why Asian Americans never had Asian
American lives matter
because nobody questioned it
wasn't a question nobody even thought
about it of course they do
the reason that black Americans wanted
to make sure that black lives matter is
it felt like they didn't it just felt
like they didn't
but if you want to make black lives
matter
stop working on this side that's not how
you get there this is a false path
these are all real things there really
is systemic racism you know I'm I'm a
big believer in it but you need to
ignore it if you want to personally
succeed if you want to personally
succeed work on strategies the rest of
it will become irrelevant pretty quickly
really quickly now you might say to me
Scott you're being simplistic
because the reason you can't work on
those personal strategies is you're
you're in such a bad situation
to which I say that is a loser's
strategy or a loser's philosophy if you
believe you can't because you have
obstacles well then you can't somebody
smart said that once if you believe you
can't you're right
if you believe you can you're probably
right
so this is my contribution I do it at
obviously great personal risk
but I'm in a position where I could do
that and so I thought it was useful and
I only do it because it's useful it
probably looks like I'm trying to get
clicks but not this
this is only because I think it's useful
and that ladies and gentlemen concludes

presentation for today YouTube I'll talk
to you tomorrow
