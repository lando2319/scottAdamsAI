good morning everybody
what a glorious day
it might be one of the best days of all
time
maybe
maybe don't know
um and i see that one of the commenters
has already gotten ahead of things and
said scott scott scott
you're wrong
and that's exactly the kind of
insightful commentary i've come to
expect
because i spend time on social media and
that's
and that's pretty good comment on social
media but
let's say
let's say
today wasn't
good enough
let's say there was a little bit of
joy you could still squeeze out of this
day and you don't have it yet what would
you do
hmm
maybe the simultaneous sip yeah it could
be the only thing you don't have right
now and all you need is a copper mugger
glass a tanker challenge just iron a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
mean of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip
and it rocks you around the world go
ah
oh i see there are some conscientious
objectors somebody here in the comments
says
i'll sip when i want to sip
yeah
that's what everybody says in the
beginning
but over time you'll notice that the
sippers are happier
better looking
a lot healthier
and dare i say sexier now you could keep
holding out
it's a free country and i
i wouldn't discourage you from
being your own person dancing to your
own beat
and
having it your way
it turns out that your way will be
less awesome than the other way but
certainly you have that option and i
hope you express it perfectly
well here's an update on
california um i can't go to the gym
because i don't want to work out with a
mask
a lot of people can't go to work still
i can't take a walk
because the air quality is too low
because of all the forest fires
but there is one thing that we can do in
northern california that other people
don't have access to
so no matter how bad things are
right where you live there might be
needles on the street and there might be
homeless and you know you might have any
number of problems including not being
able to breathe when you go outside but
we do have this asset in northern
california called lake tahoe
now if you're not familiar with it lake
tahoe is a super clear lake and a
vacation
even gambling destination
and it's a
three or four hour drive depending on
where you live in northern california so
it's kind of perfect for the getaway
so lake tahoe you know everything else
is going to hell in california but at
least we've
we have lake tahoe when we hold on
i'm getting an update
lake tahoe is on fire
and all 22 000 residents have been told
to get out
okay like i was saying we don't really
have lake tahoe to go to
but um
i'm sure we have other things
i'm sure there are other things
but
how's your state doing
how's your state doing
um is your stay running low on water
electricity and breathable air and
unburnt homes because we're running low
on that stuff here in california
and don't tell me cal don't tell me
florida about your zero taxes that just
makes me feel terrible it really does
now
how bad are things in california
how bad has governor newsom screwed the
pooch
well let me let me just give you
a little clue about how badly california
is managed at the moment
so badly
that we have to make up new vocabulary
words
well we don't make them up but we have
to introduce
entirely new words
for how bad things are i'm not making
this up by the way
as of today
california
came up with a new word
to describe what's happening apparently
the tahoe fire is so bad
that it's creating what are called
pyrocumulus crack clouds
which are more than just menacing
looking
oh yes they're more than menacing these
pyrocumulus clouds
are so intense that
nasa has dubbed them the fire-breathing
dragons of clouds
due to its sheer intensity
that's right
things are so bad in california
that super clouds have formed
super clouds
super clouds of death have formed over
the state
now we're having a recall election
and
if larry elder
can't be a sitting governor who is being
possibly recalled
because things are so bad
that
death clouds are forming over the state
and we have to come up with new names
for it because we haven't even heard of
anything so bad before
how do you lose
if you know
if you're running against him and you're
leading in the polls like larry elder
how do you lose
how is that possible
i mean anything could happen i'm not
going to make a prediction about the
election except that i think
the
the recall will probably be polling
lower than it will actually turn out
um
here's a propaganda news
propaganda news
carpe duncan says south park was right
smoke is real
yes
uh
david smith tweeted
a reuters headline um
that
this this is how reuters
describes this news so reuters says
analysis
u.s liberals see dwindling legal options
to challenge voting curbs
voting curbs
who's trying to put on voting curbs
anybody anybody well apparently
according to this reuters headline
trying to stop election fraud
is voting curbs yeah voting curbs
it's not trying to stop election fraud
it's trying to stop voting
now
let me confess
that whether it's a democrat or a
republican who's trying to change any
rules about voting
it doesn't matter if it's a democrat or
a republican the real reason is
right i mean it doesn't matter who's
doing it the republicans are doing it at
the moment and of course they're trying
to change the rules so they can win
and of course it's not a hundred percent
about
reducing fraud
conveniently it probably would reduce
fraud conveniently but that's not why
they do it
if the fraud worked in their favor they
wouldn't be doing it
right
so so certainly the reason is political
even if the
outcome is something that you would ask
for a fair election
uh here's some more fake news this time
on social media i don't think any of the
news networks pick this up
uh but on social media
there's a clip that got over 400 000
views
of what appears to be house speaker
pelosi saying
after uh sort of a hot mic situation am
i on
uh no we don't want him to talk talking
about biden so it's a fake video fake
news so if you think that nancy pelosi
said on a hot mic
no we don't want biden to to talk
that didn't happen
all right uh here's anecdotal persuasion
of the day remember i told you cnn will
do
one story per day and it's kind of funny
watching it because they have to reach
to get that one story
about the
the non-vaccinated person who regrets it
now
regrets it now and here's yours today
so uh on uh so this is on cnn's page
friend shares conservative vaccine
deniers last words
to her
so anderson cooper 360.
i said there's a growing list of
conservatives who have used their
platform to discourage people from
getting a vaccine
but they did not live long enough to
tell them how they regret it
cnn's sarah sidner reports so watch this
once a day
cnn will do an anecdotal persuasion
report
about the conservative who was against
vaccinations and died
now let me think
are there any other
large
identifiable groups
that are also low on the vaccination
rates
who could it be who could it be
black america
i'm waiting for the stories on cnn in
which they say
black americans
are are regretting that they didn't get
vaccinated and they're they're dying
from coven
but no it seems like all the anecdotes
they pick are of white
fat conservatives
so that's news
is this news or is this propaganda it's
propaganda
it's pure
unadultered propaganda
now you could argue that it's good for
you
right the people who think vaccinations
are good
and i'm in the camp that got a
vaccination so i would be in that camp i
don't care what you do
let's get that clear
i don't care what you do
i just want to get my own vaccination
you do you i'll do me and we'll all be
good
here's some more uh
fake news did we talked about this i
predicted that the
video that was going around the internet
of what appeared to be a taliban in a
helicopter hanging somebody dangling
from the helicopter
i predicted that that was fake news and
that that was not actually a video of a
hanging or if it was it wasn't the
context that we thought it was
and it turns out that a respected
journalist in that area
is personal personally acquainted with
the pilot of the helicopter
and knows that it was actually a guy in
a harness who was attempting to install
the taliban flag from the area but it
didn't work in the end so you didn't you
didn't see any flag stuff because
whatever they were trying to do didn't
work out
but
you could see his arms moving
couldn't you
couldn't you see his arms moving nobody
hangs somebody without tying their arms
if you don't tie somebody's arms behind
their back and you hang them they just
reach up and grab the rope
and then it takes forever for them to
die because they'll just be hanging
there like
and you'll be looking at your watch like
joe biden you're like ugh
i don't know how strong he is but he's
been hanging there a good 20 minutes
we do have lunch plans can we maybe next
time tie his hands behind his back this
is not a good way to hang somebody
now
here's the persuasion angle on this
if you saw the video after somebody
tweeted that it was an example of the
taliban hanging somebody
that's what you saw
if you read a tweet that said it was
somebody hanging from a helicopter
you saw hanging
i know i did because i i read the prime
the priming sentence first and then i
looked at and i thought oh my god
that does look like somebody hanging
from a taliban helicopter
but then i thought about it for five
seconds and i thought
probably not
it's a little bit
too on the nose if you know what i mean
a little bit too on the nose it's
exactly what you expected
so when you get exactly what you expect
all your flags should go up right
sometimes you do get exactly what you
expect
that's not unusual
but always
always be a little cautious of getting
exactly the news story everybody said it
was going to happen
now obviously the taliban is doing some
bad stuff over there but this was
so showy
that it was a little bit too much on the
nose
all right uh
yasi gestner on twitter i haven't seen
much of him lately i wonder what
happened to him
he used to be very active but i don't
know if i'm just being
banned from seeing him but i haven't
seen a tweet for him for forever it
seems like
um
he said there are seven incidents in the
last three days with the biden
administration that would have been
days-long scandals if the big media had
decided to make it that way
so this is a reasonably independent
voice if you don't know who yasi is
i've seen him take positions that seem
at least reasonably independent doesn't
seem to be exactly a
team only player i think he's a team
player like most people but he does seem
to be able to be a little bit
independent fact check me on that if i'm
wrong about that but that's what my
memory serves me
um
and he's saying he's pointing out that
there would have been
seven
gigantic stories
about the biden administration recently
you know bad stories scandals and they
just decided not to
so
i guess it's just one scandal about
people left behind in afghanistan and
and of course the marines getting killed
at the last few days
but
um and yossi
warns us that you have to watch the dog
not barking basically you have to watch
for the fact that the media has decided
not to make a story out of something
because that's the story too
when somebody decides it's not a story
they've made a very very big decision
for the rest of the country
so watch out for that
the matt gates story
is getting interesting so there were two
parts to the matt gates story number one
he was accused of doing some underage
sex trafficking thing which we have seen
no alleged victim
come forward
and no evidence that it really happened
right they're allegations but we haven't
seen anything that looks like evidence
any of it actually happened i'm not
saying it did or didn't
because how would i know
i'm just saying that we haven't seen
evidence
so very similar to how the democrats say
well there's no fraud in the election
because we haven't seen any evidence or
at least proof they would say
i haven't seen any evidence
and the longer you wait
for evidence of this allegation
the less likely it's going to happen
now i give you this rule all the time
and they're now one two three four here
are five examples
and four of them are still hot meaning
we're still watching them so here are
five examples of something uh that
demonstrates this point that the longer
you wait
to find out that somebody did something
bad
the less likely it's true
because you would at least hear leaks
and and stuff so every day that goes by
that an allegation no matter what the
allegation is is unproven
it's less likely it'll ever be proven
now that's not true in the first you
know two weeks or something because
nobody has any information but if you go
a year
or if you go you know six months
that starts to tell you something really
six months
a year you can't find anything after six
months of looking
nothing
probably indicates there's nothing there
so here are the ones that we're waiting
on the sonic weapon
we keep waiting for that confirmation of
that sonic weapon that's hurting the
embassies
longer we wait
the less likely there's really a sonic
weapon
the arizona audit i know you want the
arizona to have the goods you want you
want that want it to really show you
something and surprise you and be big
news
it might be it's possible
but the longer you wait
less likely about all those trump
financial crimes you know the ones that
trump himself would go to jail for
still waiting
still waiting what about all the
problems with his tax returns
still waiting
right still waiting seth rich good
example the longer we wait to find out
what happened with seth rich
the longer probably there's nothing
there
how about
russia collusion we waited and waited on
russia collusion and sure enough the
longer we waited the less likely there
would be any and then we didn't find any
it was predictive and now the matt gates
allegations the longer we wait
the less likely that that's going to
turn into anything but there is a big
update there were two parts of this
story one is that matt had
alleged that there was a black male
attempt against
him and his father
and which they would
try to get him pardoned for some kind i
guess these allegations
uh
in return for 25 million part part of it
would be used for some iranian hostage
release that may not even be alive
every part of it was sketchy
but apparently the people involved in
that alleged blackmail scheme
have been indicted
so so so far
matt gates
is looking completely accurate in his
part of the story so far
don't know what could happen in the
future we're not magic right but so far
it's right on plan
that the allegations are going to turn
out to be i can't predict it
but that's the way it's happening so if
you were going to predict
i put
i'd say i'd put a solid 75
chance
that the gates allegations turn into
nothing
now this is independent of whether he
did or did not do anything that part i
have no idea
but whether or not the allegations turn
into something that becomes a problem
i'd say no more than 25
which is different from whether he did
or did not do anything
let's talk about pierce morgan and i
warn you there will be some swearing in
this segment
it's possible
that the f-bomb will be dropped
and here's the story
pierce morgan he was cleared by
apparently there's this britain uh
british media watchdog group
and they they take complaints i guess
there were 50 000 complaints
because pierce morgan has said that he
didn't believe a word that meghan markle
said
and he even doubted her feelings about
feeling suicidal i guess she said that
on oprah
and
he
he walked off the job and i get i don't
know if he got fired or walked off or
whatever what it was looks like some
kind of combination there
and
so apparently there's some media
watchdog entity
that gets to decide
whether
his opinion
let me say this again
there's a group in great britain
that gets to decide
if somebody's
should get them kicked off the air not
not fake news
it's not about uh
spreading fake
data
right it's about his opinion
his opinion of somebody he knows
personally
and thinks that she is not credible and
a liar
a person he knows personally
right
that's like the best opinion you could
have
it's one thing that we all have opinions
about you know global affairs and we
don't know much about it and we're not
there but to have an opinion about
somebody you know personally
you spend time with
i mean that's that's a fair opinion even
if you don't agree with it it's
certainly a fair opinion
so here's the
cursing part
what kind of whole country
drives an opinion guy out of an opinion
job for an opinion
what the is wrong with great
britain
i had no idea you guys were so up
are you serious are you kidding
me
that pierce morgan could lose a career
over a opinion on a
opinion show now i know they have news
and other stuff
but it's clearly an opinion
and
probably right
right i mean i don't know that for sure
but it's not only just an opinion but
it's an informed opinion and probably
 right
and he's gonna lose his job over that
what the hell is wrong with your
 country great britain
seriously
i'm glad we had a revolution to get the
 away from that
holy
i had no idea that was really a thing
but i guess it is
f-bombs off
for the rest of this program there will
be no inappropriate cursing
oh except at home you're going to do a
little inappropriate cursing now
i hate to do this to you
all right this is a question for those
of you who have not followed this news
item that is
new today
there was a randomized controlled trial
you recognize those words as being the
gold standard of a trial and a very
large number of people 350 000 people
were studied
randomized
controlled trial this is the good stuff
we're not talking about these
observational studies we're not talking
about looking at what happened and
trying to make a study out of that no
those are the low quality studies we're
not talking about a small group of
people that's low quality we're talking
about a really large group
randomized controlled
double blind i think it was
trial that's what the controlled part
means
on masks
what do you think you found
now again you're this is not about my
opinion
i'm asking you if you saw the news or
actually if you didn't see the news so
this is better if you didn't see the
news but you have a strong opinion on it
we finally have good science
did the mass work or not go don't look
it up
don't look it up
tell me what the tell me what the
randomized control trial said
when they really had some good data what
do you
think
i'm looking at the comments on locals
and on youtube
and almost all of you say that masks
that it would say mass don't work there
are some people who say it's helpful
and others saying doesn't work
okay remember this is not my opinion and
this is not me persuading you okay i
remind you
that i'm anti-mask
now
i'm anti-mask
just hear that first right i'm anti-mask
if you're vaccinated anyway
now i would still wear a mask if i were
around old people
you know if i was in a special situation
i'll put the mask on if it's a business
and i'm not trying to screw the business
owner right it's not about that
so yeah i mean i'll grudgingly wear some
if i have to but i'm anti i'm anti-mask
um
and we'll talk about the touching the
mask thing too
so here's what the trial said it works
the trial said pretty unambiguously
that masks work
the the better mass the n95 work better
but the other masks also work in a
substantial way
substantial being a nine percent
reduction
now is a nine percent reduction
substantial
yeah
yeah it's pretty substantial
now we're hearing by the way the study
uh that i saw came to us from jason
abbaluk
a professor of economics at yale
professor of what
virology
no
professor of medicine
no
do you want a professor of virology or a
professor of medicine to do this study
no you don't
you don't you want them involved
but you want some economists involved
right what you want is a professor of
economics from yale
that's who you want and people like that
so when you see a study that was put
together at least partially by
economists
highly highly qualified ones who can do
the math and they know what to compare
that's starting to get pretty good
so anyway there was a nine percent
reduction in serology i think in other
words number of people who had the
infections whether they knew it or not
and
if people wore the better mask there was
an even bigger difference all right
now you ask yourself
but what about all of the other factors
that go along with wearing masks for
example
people wear masks probably have other
behaviors
that go with it right if you decide to
wear a mask you're probably the same
person who decided
to stay away from people right so there
are other behaviors that might be just
correlated with mask wearing that would
make mask wearing look like it's working
but really it was just the other
behaviors that are correlated with it
well they they tried to control for that
and they also looked at the difference
between the good mass and the lesser
good masks and there was a big
difference
and
if you take all of that together it does
it's a pretty compelling case for masks
now
i have been criticized quite rightly i
like it when people criticize me fairly
and accurately
i know it's weird but remember the
the theme of these live streams
is finding your
finding your blind spots your
psychological blind spots so anytime i
can find one of mine
and do it in public and show you how
stupid i was and how i missed something
because i was either primed or
confirmation bias or something else
i'll do that because that's good for my
brand right to show you that i was wrong
and why
um
so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna crow
about this one because i was criticized
rightly
for uh emphasizing studies that agree
with me
have i ever done that
if i ever emphasize the studies that
coincidentally agree with me
yes that is a valid that is a valid
criticism
and so
let me give the same warning for this
randomized controlled
highly qualified study i'm not sure i i
i believe any study
we're we're living in a world where
basically every study is questionable
right so
this one is too
but
it does look like
more than we've seen so far
so i'll just put it out there and you
can do with it what you want but i don't
care if you wear a mask or not so let's
be clear about that so biden did his
press conference about the withdrawal
and i'm going to give him this credit
he made good on getting out
he did it
was it a messed up cluster f
yes
does it look like lots of
elements of it were botched
yes
was it going to be messy no matter what
because biden actually said that it was
going to be messy no matter what is that
true
yes
but did it have to be this messy
probably not it doesn't look like it had
to be so i think most people are
agreeing that uh
you know he screwed the pooch on that
um
here's a question so there are lots i
guess a few hundred americans who didn't
get out and maybe have expressed some
interest in getting out but as biden
pointed out they've had since march to
get out
and we don't know exactly what is their
situation some of them are dual
citizenship and want to stay et cetera
we just don't know exactly the situation
with these people
but
i'm not sure i care
and
it's that we had until we had since
march to get out problem
that's making me care less
now i care about humans
you know and i care about anybody who
might be in a bad situation then it
would be tragic but i feel like they
made their own choice
right
somebody says couldn't give visas
there might be some of those and that
would be the most tragic
but
i don't know i'm until we know more
about this group of people
i'm going to reserve my sympathy because
it looks like they're choosing to stay
many of them now even the ones who
couldn't get visas and couldn't get out
if they're americans
they did have since march to try
and i believe i need to know more
so i guess i'm open-minded
that there's a horror there and people
didn't get out and they could become
you know i don't know hostages or
whatever so i definitely have all the
fears that you have same fears but
i just would need to know more about why
they're not out
because i don't know if the level of
sympathy that we're giving them is
appropriate to their own situation there
may be people who just haven't decided
and want to take their chances of
staying i don't know
could be anything
so
we did leave with dishonor does anybody
disagree with the statement
that we left with dishonor
really the deepest dishonor you can have
so dishonor comes two ways one is you
lose
and we clearly lost 20 years of fighting
we just lost
sure we you know got rid of bin laden in
a different country but basically we
lost
so that's one dishonor
but i can't think of a bigger dishonor
than leaving your allies behind
can you
now it certainly would be a big dishonor
to leave americans behind it would be a
dishonor to leave any of our troops
behind we'd all agree with that
but
somehow it feels like a bigger dishonor
to leave our allies who are not american
behind
do you feel that is it just me
because that's worse
than you know people in your own country
are making their own judgments and risks
and deciding they should or should not
have gone down in march and all that
stuff but
leaving people who helped us fight
that feels like the deepest dishonor i
can even imagine i mean it's bad enough
if you left troops there you left
americans there that's terrible
it's terrible
but leaving our allies behind
that's
you know that's a level of
dishonor that i just i don't know we
could ever match that with almost
anything
almost anything and left it and left the
dogs there too
yeah
i mean
a lot of you had the same feeling which
is you felt worse about the dogs and we
we did all feel pretty bad about that
all right
um
so
i don't know i have mixed feelings about
biden's performance believe it or not
there's no doubt that some parts of this
were botched but i'd like to know if the
lower level people were really the cause
of the problem
was it the generals
until i know that i'm gonna i'm gonna
withhold a little bit of criticism from
biden
not all of it i mean
he he earned some criticism but i feel
like i need to know a little bit more
about what happened behind closed doors
and i think
biden may have pushed through some
resistance
which would be good leadership
even if people died
because that's that's the leadership
decision right you're taking calculated
risks and they don't always work out
that's what the leader has to do
i feel like he might have pushed through
his generals and taken a bad path
because it was the better of the two bad
baths it might have been an even worse
path i don't know we'll wait to see
but the weird thing about this is it
looks like we're going to enter a phase
in which
we'll have to give economic aid to the
taliban
in order for them to cooperate and
getting americans and maybe our allies
in the country out
and what's weird about this is
apparently we ended up blackmailing
ourselves
and i think it goes like this hey
taliban make you deal
we'll give you some economic aid or at
least we won't block it if other people
want to give it to you
but you've got to help us get our people
out
and the taliban would say
what
yeah we'll give you we'll make sure you
get economic aid either by not blocking
it or giving it to you
you just have to let our people get out
and the taliban would be like i'm not
sure i'm hearing this right
but did you just offered to blackmail
yourself
and we'd say well we don't like to use
those words
but yes we're going to offer to pay for
you to release
people in your country and the taliban
would be
i don't know
that sounds exactly like blackmail
and it wasn't even our idea
but thank you
thank you for that excellent idea
is there any
you know can we participate in
any way in the blackmail no no we got
this
we'll handle everything we'll get you
the aid
and uh
and then you'll do what you said you're
gonna do anyway which is let the
americans out and uh we'll call it good
scott are we the baddies
uh good movie quote
uh rasmussen poll
says that 52 of voters think biden
should resign over afghanistan
well
looks like they picked up some
independents if not democrats
so that would be pretty much all
republicans or most of them and
a smattering of others
um
and even worse
um
only 38
say kabul harris is very or somewhat
qualified to take over
so even democrats
and or independents
they must be in their in big numbers
don't think vice president harris could
take over she's been a senator
from the biggest state
why is it that a senator from california
is unqualified to be president
i mean that must be about her
it's not about job experience
right i mean kennedy had about the same
um
so and uh roughly 60 of the respondents
were leaning toward impeachment
what
60 of the public
is leaning toward impeachment
did trump ever have 60
can somebody do a fact check on me
maybe
maybe rasmussen can answer this question
for me
did trump ever reach that level of uh
people wanting to impeach him
i don't think so i don't think he ever
get out of the 50s or 40s
40s maybe
does anybody have an idea was it 40s or
50s but 60s out of control
if 60 of the country wants you impeached
you need to leave today
you need to leave today
you need to be packing your damn bags
i'm seeing somebody say 48 in the
comments we'll leave that for a fact
check
so
there's a vicious attack ad
for the new sub recall
that says imagine having to choose
between taking a shower or doing your
laundry and then there's a visual of a
woman who's
taking making that choice
and i guess there's some kind of i
didn't know about it some legislation
that in 2025 you'll be limited to 52
gallons of water or something i don't
know if that's household or per person
or what that is
but
that is really strong persuasion
really strong persuasion now remember
persuasion is not about what's true
persuasion is about what moves you
and i would say that this is some of the
strongest i've seen because it makes you
think about these two choices which
aren't real choices you know they're
just sort of artificial choices
but it puts you so in the picture
it's one thing to say hey we're running
low on water
because everybody knows that it's very
different
to make you imagine choosing between
laundry and cleaning yourself
because that's gross right
the
the power of this persuasion is that it
hit your grossness
trigger
because we all have a grossness trigger
some say conservatives have more of one
i don't know if that's true
but
if you can go personal grossness
in your persuasion
and you can make them think there's a
false choice
because they just made up this choice
but you know it makes the point uh and
it can make you think past the the sale
that newsom did a bad job
uh it's really powerful i actually
felt like getting standing up when i saw
it like my body was so activated by how
persuasive this is i immediately wanted
to like get more active in the campaign
it's actually that good i
you don't see a campaign egg that's this
good
this is like a 10
and you don't usually see more than six
or seven in the campaign ads they're
usually so obviously partisan and
bs
all right texas has a new abortion bill
that is
very creative
so it has to do with the heartbeat
detected
so
some number of weeks
and i guess it would ban 85 percent of
abortions in a practical sense because
most people don't know that they're
pregnant
in those first few weeks so people don't
even know they're pregnant until a
heartbeat could be detected that's not
what tells them but it's about the same
time
um so under this new law they did this
clever work around where you can sue
the
the practitioner i guess
uh so an individual not not the state
but the an individual a private citizen
anywhere in the country can bring a
civil suit
against anyone who assisted the pregnant
person who tried to get a
an abortion that would be against this
ban
what do you think of that
what's your opinion on that
let me start out by telling you my
opinion on abortion
my opinion on abortion
is that my opinion on abortion should
have carried no weight
whatsoever
let me say it again my opinion on
abortion
because of my penis
should carry no weight
you should ignore it and so you should
ignore it so much i'm not even going to
bother telling you what it is because
basically i don't have one except that
women should make the decision
why do i have the opinion that women
should make the decision
i will need one more permission for the
f-bomb
can i have it can somebody give me
permission for one more f-bomb i told
you i wouldn't do it so i need
permission
all right locals i see a yes i need
youtube give me a yes
give me give me permission for one more
f-bomb and i'll give it to you
granted thank you all right we have
permission
for the f-bomb
the reason that i do not give you my
opinion on abortion
is that if men were the only ones who
could have babies
if men were the only ones who could have
babies
and a woman gave me your opinion about
whether i should you know have the right
to get an abortion or not i would say
 you
 your opinion and off
because you don't have the ability to
have a baby
people who have the ability to having a
baby can make the decision because it's
a life and death decision and the most
credible people to make it are women and
more the people who have the babies if
it were reversed
and only men had babies
 off
 off you're not part of the decision
at all
i don't want to hear your
opinion
about the baby that i can have and you
can't have
okay that's my opinion now reverse it
i can't have a baby because i'm male
women can
women should tell me
 off
i hope
that's exactly the right opinion the
only opinion i want to hear from women
about abortion is that i should off
now i don't care what you do
again
same with mass and vaccinations what you
do is your own decision right i'm not
trying to persuade you to adopt my
opinion i'm just saying that's mine
um
but they found this workaround so i
guess it has a better chance of
surviving legal challenges despite uh
reverse wade
because it doesn't put the government in
the
prosecuting business it puts private
citizens
it gives them the right to sue
and
i don't know what do you think about
this it's pretty creative
very creative
um
so if you just talk about the creativity
of it um it's good i guess in that sense
that narrow sensor would be good
but what would be the
likely unintended consequence
what is the unintended consequence of uh
texas getting away with this and it
would ban effectively 85 percent of it
i can see
two
two unintended consequences there are
probably lots of them but two i'll talk
about number one
texas just became less
competitive economically
now again i'm not saying good or bad
about abortion i'm just just predicting
what will happen you get to decide
whether you like it or not right
if you are a 20 something person with
technical skills and you are thinking of
moving to austin
let's say to get out of california
and you just found out let's say you're
left-leaning
or pro-abortion
you just found out that you wouldn't be
able to get one in texas
do you still go
you're a 20-something female
and you're left-leaning
would you ever move to texas if you knew
you couldn't get an abortion there
in a practical sense you couldn't get it
i don't think so
i i think that that puts just a hard
stop
on something like 40 percent of all the
potential
technology workers that that texas could
scoop up from other places
so i think it's going to hurt them
economically will they notice i don't
know their economy is pretty good they
probably won't even notice but it's it's
going to happen
now
here's the other thing
it almost guarantees that the court is
going to get packed
right because if the court does not find
some creative way to stop this and bring
it back in compliance i guess that would
be the right word
with uh
roe versus wade
i think democrats are going to push for
court packing
so i feel like
texas just made court packing almost
guaranteed
because the abortion
topic is the
topic buster
it's the one thing that people will
will act differently about right there
are lots of things we just talk about
but when it gets to abortion they're
gonna act differently
right abortion makes you act differently
that topic does
i know i think we're going to get a
packed court because of this and texas
is going to take a hit in the technology
realm especially
there was a story about a valedictorian
in texas
named by the name of a girl named do you
say girl if she's 17 or 18
what it what is the correct they
i don't know
a girl slash woman let's say a young
woman
she was the high school valedictorian so
she gets to do a speech but she did a
switcheroo
she did not read the speech that she
said she was going to read and instead
did a
a takedown of the new texas abortion
guidelines so
what do you think about that
she thought they thought she was going
to give a speech about one thing and she
gave a speech about another thing
well
i know somebody who's watching this
right now who's saying
don't say it
um
i would just say that i did the same
thing so i i was a valedictorian in my
tiny little class in windham new york
they're only i don't know
40 people in the class whatever it was
so it's not that hard to be a
valedictorian if there are only 40
people in the class
but
so i got to give a speech
and there was a rule in place that
you had to submit your speech ahead of
time
do you know why there was a rule in
place they had to submit your speech
ahead of time
it was so
you didn't do a speech that would get
you in trouble
do you know why my small school had that
rule
it's because my brother gave a speech on
graduation night
and he didn't give the speech they were
expecting
let's just stop there let's just say uh
he had an objective
that he accomplished
that had nothing to do with a graduation
night speech
uh and it was the most ballsy thing i've
ever seen in my life
honestly it was the most
epically
ballsy thing i've ever ever seen period
and it caused them to change the rules
they said all right from now on we're
going to have to see that speech before
you read it in front of everybody in the
town so when it was my turn
i don't think they were happy that
another adams was going to do a speech
on graduation night
because they had to they had to give him
some pause right oh god he's got a
brother
and so i wrote two speeches
one i submitted it was just complete
bs about oh as we leave these hello
dolls and move on to our lifetime and
careers
yadda yadda so i literally wrote two
speeches
and i handed it one for approval and
they said this is a very fine speech and
i laughed because i had no intention of
reading it and then the speech i did
was just stand up comedy
so i just did a stand-up comedy routine
that i didn't think they would
appreciate
and
i threw away my speech
so
um
that happened
what else is happening north korea
just said no thank you to the
vaccinations they were offered a whole
bunch of free vaccinations they said no
thanks we don't have any problem
could it be that north korea is the
first country to reach herd immunity
maybe
it could be herd immunity
i'd love to know what's going on there
uh israel is going to use rapid tests
for school kids everybody every kid will
school kid will get a rapid test now
they're not 100 accurate but they're
just trying to get as many as they they
can get
before they go to school
why aren't we doing that in the united
states
because we're idiots or there's some
corruption let me go on record as saying
that someday we will learn that the
reason the united states did not go big
on their so-called rapid tests which
were a little less accurate
than the standard tests that the reason
we didn't do it was corruption
i i think i think it's guaranteed at
this point
because in the beginning you could say
well it took a while or you know maybe
we need to understand it better or
whatever
but not now
at this point we can say with complete
certainty that there was some massive
corruption involved there's no other
explanation for why we don't have rapid
deaths
pew research found that democrats think
the news is real
at least by far bigger numbers almost
double than republicans republicans seem
to know
that the news is not real
but democrats actually think it was
is that our biggest problem
what if you
had a big
program to try to train democrats
to follow the news correctly
because democrats have a problem
they think the news is real
that's a really big problem
in fact you could argue it's the biggest
problem in the country
because
if they learned the news wasn't real
then they could analyze it very
similarly to how republicans would it
won't mean they're on the same page but
they'll be a lot closer
right it'd be a lot closer
you know if if democrats knew that trump
had never actually recommended drinking
bleach
they might feel a little bit better
about having him as president
but they think he'd they actually think
that happened now there are people
watching this who are saying
what
i i watched it myself i i know he
recommended
bleach
no you didn't
you think
it's a mass
a mass hallucination there are millions
of people in this country who believe
they personally witnessed
president trump
saying you should
inject bleach
you've seen the videos you've heard it
you might have even gone back to watch
it a second time
and guess what
it never happened
whatever you're watching is the the
edited one that's misleading but the
thing you think happened never happened
it literally never happened not even
close to happening
there was nothing that ambiguously
happened nothing close he was talking
about light as a disinfectant that was
it
so poor democrats think the news is real
i think they need an intervention and
that
is the best live stream in the history
of the universe i think you'd all agree
i've got to go do something else right
now
um
somebody says i watched it live yeah see
there are people on here who actually
think it happened because they saw it
i actually saw it people say no you
didn't
no you didn't you actually did not see
it because it never happened
all right
that's all for now youtube see
