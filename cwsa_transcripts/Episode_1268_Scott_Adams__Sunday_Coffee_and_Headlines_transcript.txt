um hey everybody come on in
come on in it's time it's time for
coffee with scott adams
and how about this i'm
on time yeah yeah that's new
normally i'm quite dependable but lately
or not so much but i think i'm back
i'm back in the saddle now and how can
you
make the best of this morning well i've
got a suggestion
it's called the simultaneous zip and all
you need is a copper marker or glass a
tanker chelsea stein a canteen jugger
flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopey day of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
did you get here on time hurry hurry
it's time go
could have been warmer but still
excellent still excellent
so let me uh tell you about all the
interesting
news today
um okay there wasn't any interesting
news today
because there's this fellow you may have
heard of him
uh donald trump he's not in the news as
much anymore and
turns out there isn't any news when he's
not there
but we can still talk about him even
though he's not in the news yeah we
still have that
it's sort of like trying to get off a
heroine and you know you have that
whatever that drug is you take when
you're trying to get off heroin
that's what we got so let's have a
little bit of that
so a cardiff university study
of chinese social media influence
discovered that one of the things that
the chinese were pushing
was the claim that trump had said
to uh drink bleach
that's right so now there's a study that
shows that china
was boosting the hoax that
trump had said drink bleach now of
course the hoax is started by our own
media
so you can't really blame china for
so basically all china needed to do to
to influence our elections is retweet
cnn hoaxes and i'm looking at it and i'm
saying
damn you china china
wait a minute is that really china
influencing the elections
because all they did was use social
media and retweet some stuff they liked
which i'm pretty sure is legal you can
retweet things you agree with right
now of course i don't know how many
accounts were involved but apparently
not a lot
it was like dozens of accounts did it
make any difference to our election
probably not but i would just point out
that china and cnn were apparently on
the same side
when it comes to the bleach drinking
hoax which even today people are arguing
with me online
but that really happened scott i saw it
with my own eyes
here's a link to it and of course the
link
doesn't have it but they think they
actually sent a link
with something about trump saying drink
bleach but it's
not there it's kind of spooky
speaking of believing things that don't
exist
the cue phenomenon needs to be
understood very differently than the way
it's being portrayed
so i think cnn's take on it is that
there are people who believed in q
and they're crazy people and then there
are people like cnn's hosts
who don't believe in the q stuff
and they are reasonable people
people with good brains that are working
really well
they're seeing the world about the way
it is pretty accurate
but those other people oh those q people
according to cnn there is a crazy bunch
we don't even know what's going on there
let's just laugh at it
let's just laugh at it but is that a
good description of
what's happening in the world well i
would have said so
before i became a hypnotist you hear
about this too much for me already but
the one of the main things that you
learn
to learn to be a hypnotist is that
everybody is cue
everybody is a cue believer
if you don't get that then you can't
you can't be a persuader you can't be a
hypnotist it's a basic understanding
of how people are wired if you don't
understand the basic
way a human being any human being normal
human being
if you don't understand the basic way
we're wired you just can't be a
hypnotist
it just doesn't work because you
wouldn't have the the most fundamental
understanding
and the most fundamental understanding
is this
every one of you is a cube believer
every one of us we just believe
different stuff
maybe you believe the cue stuff maybe i
believe
a religion that you think is a cult
maybe i believe a religion that you
think was wrong
maybe i believe something i saw in the
news on cnn
but it didn't really happen and it
should be obvious it didn't happen
but people believe it here are some of
the things
that cue believers do not believe
all right we've heard the things that
cube leavers believe
and then we all then those who don't
believe that stuff
which is most of us say ha ha ha
ha ha ha the key believers right they're
they're crazy people
here are some things that the cue
believers don't believe
okay these are things they don't believe
most of them you know it's a
generalization
mostly they don't believe in the fine
people hoax
they don't believe in the bleach
drinking hoax
they don't believe the hoax that there
was something like a real coup attempt
at the capital assault they don't
believe that
it's been proven that elections were
transparent
or that it's been proven that fraud
didn't happen
it is true that has not been proven that
fraud happened at a white
at a widespread level so while there is
no information that it's been
proven there's no information that's
been proven
to be transparent either which is a
common belief the
democrats seem to have that it was a
transparent election
now those are things that cue believers
don't believe
how many of the people who watched the
cnn
special about the cue believers sat
there in their little stupid chairs
saying
look at the things those idiots believe
at the same time
they believed everything cnn told them
for years
that's what's actually happening
somebody says why are you defending q
why are you
so stupid that you think i'm
defending q
what's wrong with you seriously
how could you listen to this and
say why are you defending q
that's like the dumbest thing
anybody said in months
no the point is they're not
any worse in any way
than any of you idiots right that
includes me so we're all
idiots so i i don't i don't put you in
the idiot class
and then not put myself there where
human beings are idiots
we're all idiots we're just idiots in
different ways
all right so i was playing uh we've been
playing trivial pursuit
christine and i have and some of our
down time
so we're not trivial pursuit per se but
we've been playing on these online
trivia games
and it is fascinating to play online
trivia with someone who is also very
smart
but the things they know about are
different than the things you know about
and you and you realize like for example
i learned i don't know anything about
the planets
nothing turns out the solar system is
like this big
black box i knew there was planets i
just didn't really care about them too
much
what's the biggest planet let's see how
much you know about planets
what's the biggest planet without
looking it up
i think it's jupiter right how many
how many moons do each of the planets
have do you know that
well here are the planets in order i
think you got your uh
what's what's closest you got your
mercury
and your venus your earth your mars
your jupiter saturn uranus and neptune
in that order
did you know that i didn't know it until
the other day
do you know how many moons each of our
planets have
well uh mercury closest to the sun in
in terms of how close they are to the
sun mercury
zero venus zero earth one
mars two uh
and then i think it's saturn with like
79
moons and then it goes to
uranus with 62 and then
24 and something else 14 27 14.
so look how much i don't know about
the solar system i'm in
pluto don't give me your pluto i don't
need any pluto stuff
let's not call pluto a planet let's
let's go with the consensus
anyway my point is that everybody has
blind spots
uh there's everybody has stuff that they
think is true that isn't
everybody has uh you know
gigantic gaps in their common
understanding of the world and i'm no
different you're no different
so as soon as you tell yourself that the
q people
have some kind of weird mental problem
you don't understand anything about the
world
it's the most basic understanding that
you need to have about
reality is that the cue believers
are normal they're not right
they're just normal just like you
they just believe different stuff and
you believe other stuff that isn't true
for the most part we're all we're all in
that category all right
so coveted hospitalizations have dropped
below 100 000 for the first time in
nearly two months
and that's not enough to celebrate yes
but yet but
could be the turning point because
correct me
if i'm wrong but shouldn't the
pandemic still be getting worse because
we're we're
right smack dab in the middle of the the
winterist
the winterist time right so i would
think
all things being equal the the virus
should have continued getting worse
through february
unless we were doing things that that
worked
so one of the things you should know is
that although the vaccinations
have only gotten to what five or ten
percent of the
population uh if they get the five or
ten percent that matter the most
first you should probably guess
something like i'm just going to put a
guess on this
but i'll bet that 10 to 20
of the public being vaccinated would be
something like
a 50 reduction in deaths
if you vaccinated the right people right
if you get the people most
at risk of actually dying from it the
old people and the most
risk of getting it the frontline workers
let's say
you should be able to take 50 right off
the death rate
in maybe another month the last 50
is going to be tough but the first 50
you should get
fairly quickly and i think we might be
just
a week or two away from seeing a a
pretty steep drop
so we'll see i'm being an optimist maybe
the numbers don't quite work that way
but it should make a difference
if you get the ones who are going to die
if you protect them that should make a
big difference
all right
apparently five of uh i guess all of
them
i think trump's impeachment defense
attorney is all quit
uh a little more than a week before the
trial is going to be set
and somebody who's familiar with the
discussion says
that the reason that they quit is that
trump wanted the attorneys to argue
there was a mass election fraud and that
the election was stolen
now does that sound familiar so that's
exactly what i said
trump should do because he's not going
to get
convicted in the senate and he's never
made his argument
his argument has always been made by you
know hyperbole
and it's always you know the bad claims
and if there are any good claims we
haven't heard them yet
but if they're the bad claims are the
ones getting all the attention
so trump has never had qualified people
stand in front of the whole public
and just tell them what he believes to
be true
you know with whatever is the the best
information they have without the crazy
venezuelan stuff etc
now how much would you like
to see trump just make his case
for what he was thinking about the
election uh
security i'd really really like to see
it
and i think the country would be better
off actually i think we actually need to
get
past it now my guess is
that if you were going to see some kind
of you know
a kill shot probably you would have seen
it by now
right so it could be that all that
happens is that trump makes his case
everybody on both sides looks at it it
gets completely debunked by people who
are credible and then
then the public says okay all those
republicans who thought the election was
stolen
you've seen the best case made you've
seen it debunked
can we move on that could be a
possibility right
would that be bad would it be bad for
the republicans who still
harbor some feelings about the election
to just sort of get it out of their
system
let's just put it all out there there's
a little time has gone by so it's not as
red-hot as it was
just put it out there let the debunkers
debunk
let's just see what we know and what we
don't and maybe it tells us how to fix
it for next time
i feel as though the temperature has
come down enough
that we could talk about it now for the
first time really
because people are too excited about it
might change the outcome if you talk
about it
somebody says you lost get over it loser
goodbye i don't think you quite
understand what's going on here at kuke
but you're gone
i think the country needs to hear the
argument
and also hear the debunk of the argument
and that really hasn't been done
to let's say the the satisfaction of the
public
now some will say it's been done to the
satisfaction of the courts
i don't believe that to be true i
believe the courts
sort of had a bro a a casual
acquaintance with some of the claims
that were more ridiculous than the
others
the courts sort of had a brushing
glancing
glancing relationship with the claims
so i'd like to hear let's hear the
claims and if
and by the way if every claim turned out
to be ridiculous
a lot of the claims that we've heard are
clearly ridiculous but if they all
turned out to be ridiculous
and every one of them were debunked
right in front of you wouldn't that be
better
than what we have now because what we
have now is
you know people not so confident in the
result
but i'd like to i'd like to have more
confidence so why can't we put it out
there
let the people who want to embarrass
trump and whoever
backs his claims let them do it if trump
wants to make the
argument in public i feel like it's a
public service
because it would be more a referendum on
the transparency of our election system
in general
than it would be about any specific
claims because nothing's going to be
reversed at this point
and uh but we still have still have
interest about the next election
so let's put it out there let's see if
the public says uh
yeah that's that's uh been debunked and
we can move on
well unless he has some complaints that
can't be debunked
here's what i would expect to come out
of it
i would expect to see some statistical
claims
that maybe you haven't seen before that
would be short of proof
but certainly strong enough to you know
give you some suspicion that maybe we
should look into this a little more
probably enough to make you
work harder to fix the integrity of the
system so that it's more transparent
if all we get out of it is more
transparency for the next election
that's a lot
that would be a lot to get out of it and
i wouldn't sneeze at that that could be
a great public service actually if
if done right if done wrong it's just a
good show
which should be okay too um
so russia has arrested over a thousand
people who are
protesting in favor of this critic of
putin's
this navalny guy who was uh poisoned but
lived
people assumed that putin tried to kill
him
and i guess he's got some
popular support because there are
protests in
russia but i wonder if the u.s is behind
any of that
do you think the u.s or i know great
britain or anybody
do you think anybody is helping the
protesters
a little bit
wouldn't you assume they are
don't you assume that in the biden
administration
since we know that hillary clinton was
at least accused
of helping the protesters moving against
uh
putin in back in hillary's day wouldn't
you assume that biden is doing a similar
thing
you know trying to move against russia
by you know giving their
their opposition a little bit of a
little bit of a hand or a little bit of
a push
maybe just propaganda eyes maybe
you know maybe just propaganda yeah why
not
i mean i assume that everybody's doing
it to everybody so
i guess we'll never know um there was
one of the claims
by the uh critic is that putin has this
secret mansion
that's just super gaudy and it's got a
giant aquarium and stuff in it
and putin says that's not his and
doesn't belong to anybody he's close to
to which i say does any of that matter
is there somebody who thinks that putin
doesn't have a nice house
if he found out that putin's house was a
little bit nicer than you thought it was
or
or he found out he had more homes than
you thought he had
would that change anything is there
somebody who thinks that putin is living
like a monk
he's probably one of the richest people
in the world you know
given that he essentially controls the
wealth of russia
so i'm not sure that the critic has much
on him
given that it's just what everybody
would assume he's living like a
living like a king all right so
we'll keep an eye on that here's uh
in propaganda news have you seen the
phrase
the big lie i think cnn uses it maybe on
msnbc the big lie with capital b
capital l now i believe that the origin
of that phrase the big lie comes from
nazi propaganda
and the idea that the bigger the lie the
more likely you can get people to
believe it
if a lie is so big and outrageous
people are actually more likely to
believe it you can see the cue
phenomenon is one of those examples
the queue was such a big crazy claim
that the very bigness of it makes it
look convincing
it's small claims that you can doubt
it's like hey did somebody do something
i don't know i doubt it
but you make it big enough and people
will just sort of buy into it because
it's so big
the bigness actually is part of selling
it so
that's what the democrats have decided
that
anybody who's claiming there was a
problem with the election are part of
the quote
big lie basically painting them as nazis
right basically painting them as nazis
and basically painting me by association
right
and i'd like to give a shout out to the
propaganda masters who have
have done this the branding of the the
election claims as being the big lie
is really good nazi propaganda
because what they've done is they've
projected their own
you know their own fault on other people
turned it into the big lie put a brand
on it and actually sold it
they actually sold it to the people who
were complaining about transparency
they said your claim of fraud is the big
lie
rather than the claim that the election
was transparent
which one's the big lie is it
is it true that the election was
transparent
i haven't seen any evidence of that i've
seen evidence that people have not found
proof there was widespread fraud
i agree that's a completely true
statement in terms of the courts
um yeah
and i if i'm going to be objective about
pointing out who has good
technique as opposed to who
is right and wrong which is a separate
question you can decide who's right and
wrong
but in terms of the propaganda and
persuasion technique
this is good nazi technique so the
democrats are using
fairly tried and true nazi methods
for propaganda and it's really working
well
i guess that's that's why hitler was as
successful as he was
because and the democrats are borrowing
that technique here and it works
here's what i tweeted this morning and i
don't know if i'm canceled yet
i should probably check twitter and see
if i'm still
still on there let's see if i got
cancelled
let's see if i still have an boom
account boom
let's see does scott still have an
account
that looks like it i haven't been
canceled yet
all right what i tweeted this morning uh
maybe going by the end of the day
i said as i often say and you've heard
me say this right
i've often said that i'm 100 in favor of
referring to people
by their preferred pronouns and labels
i think that's just good manners i know
some of you
are you know incensed why are they
making me use
these words when i want to use the other
words that i've always used
why must i use your pronoun why must i
call you
you know this word when the other word
used to be fine
and i hear what you're saying it's so
it's annoying too
you feel like maybe they're taking
advantage of you or something like that
but to me the biggest factor is just
good manners if somebody says this word
for me makes me feel uncomfortable
but this other word for me does not what
am i going to do with that
i'm not going to use the word that makes
them uncomfortable because
i'm used to it right wouldn't good
manners
just pure good manners should tell you
to call people what they would like to
be called
that's it if you think it's a political
thing
if it's democrat versus republican it's
not any of that
it's just good manners
i'm watching a violent disagreement by
some of you in
the comments but i would like to take
their
take that theme that mostly people on
the left are pushing
that there are you know preferred
pronouns and preferred labels
and agree with it and say let's do more
of it
let's do more of it and i would like to
add to that that calling anybody a white
supremacist
unless they're actually a member of a
group that has that in the
you know in the mission statement but
calling just republicans
and people who are not in any way
affiliated with any kind of racist
organization
calling the white supremacists i want to
i want to put that out there that that's
basically the n word
for white people when somebody refers to
me that way as
happens you know about three times a day
on social media
the way i receive it would be
a way i would imagine somebody would
receive the n-word
it's the way i would imagine somebody
would receive being called the wrong
pronoun
it's imagine it's the way i would
imagine people rece would
receive using the insulting word for
them instead of
you know the polite word now i'm not
going to say
i'm not going to say it's a contest
right if somebody says no
the n-word is worse than all the other
words i would say yeah you can make a
pretty good argument for that
i'd probably agree with it i think the
n-word is maybe the worst of all words
you know if you were going to list all
the words in the english language
you could make a pretty good case that
the n-word is the worst word
so i'll give you that but in terms of
uh how it feels when you're on the
receiving end of it
i would like to ask for the same
consideration
that i would like to grant other people
i grant other people absolute
right under all rules of social behavior
and manners to be called exactly what
they want now of course if they want to
be called
uh king and lord i might resist that a
little bit
but if somebody has a you know proper
name for the group that they belong to
i'm happy to use that word i would just
like to ask the same
i would like to ask the same that if
anybody uses
the white supremacist label about people
who are not
you know directly involved in that kind
of behavior that that should be a firing
offense
i think that you should lose your job
for calling somebody a white supremacist
unless like i say they're actually a
member of the ku klux klan that's fine
but calling say a politician
or just a supporter or calling the
people in
queue or the rally people calling them
white supremacists
should be a cause for losing your job
and
uh if that's not immediately true well
maybe the republicans should push a
little on that
maybe maybe we should make that
something that costs you your job
because it's only up to the people who
are being called the name
to decide whether that's inappropriate
and i think that's just time to say
that that the white supremacist label is
essentially the n word for white people
again it's not a contest
if you want to tell me the n words worse
than all words i'd agree with that
but you see the point right you see the
point
um so when you tell me
that we must push back against people
trying to
push you to act and be a certain way
i say why not adopt their rule and see
if they like it
so adopting the rule they're calling
somebody a white supremacist should be a
firing offense
it should be the last time you do
business with the company
if they use that last time you vote for
somebody
it should be automatic all right
uh scott thinks conservatives have
rights
well you only have the rights that you
assert right
that's one of the uh one of the weird
parts of the law that you could have a
right
but if you don't assert it you sort of
lose it by
not using it yeah there's some context
where that's true
and this is one of those i think you
don't have the right
to anything if you don't assert it so if
you assert it
you can create the right but if you
don't assert it it doesn't matter if
it's in the constitution
that's not going to help you you got to
assert it to make it real
somebody says fight fire with fire and i
say no
fight sugar with sugar
you don't have to be unkind it doesn't
have to be a fight
you just need to agree if you use these
words that's over the line
if you say i use these words that's over
the line let's agree
let's agree there's some words over the
line and the
the affected group gets to say what
words are acceptable
i find that standard completely
reasonable
completely now uh yesterday i did uh
did a micro lesson on the locals
platform that you haven't seen here
and some people said but scott why can
you ever
why do you agree with the left when they
say use these pronouns or whatever
because they never they never give in
to the right to which i say
i don't know if that's true are you
saying that the left
never gives an inch and only the right
gives in to whatever whatever they think
the topic
requires i would say i don't know
let's see with the supreme court if the
democrats do not
uh increase the number of
people on the court then i would say
that they accepted
a lot that would be accepting a lot
if you're a democrat it's got to be
pretty tough to accept what happened at
the supreme court
you know the nominations that trump did
kind of tough to accept
but if they don't pack the court they
accepted it
that's a pretty big deal right now
uh and then i heard the argument that if
uh if they're forcing you to use i don't
know pronouns or use certain words about
people
that uh that you're losing somehow
and they're winning because they forced
you to do something but you didn't force
them to do anything
to which i say i don't know that's
why is everything framed as a battle
you don't really have to frame this one
as a fight
you can just say we always had manners
we had manners before we
will always have good manners it's not a
new thing the fact that some new words
are coming into
the conversation of what is good manners
is no big deal that happens all the time
words come and go so i don't think that
republicans would be giving up anything
by calling people by the names that they
would like to be called there's
nothing given up it's just good manners
and you wanted that
who are the republicans who were arguing
in favor of bad manners
who i don't is that an argument i don't
think so
so if you think of it as a fight yeah i
guess you're losing
so don't think of it as a fight think of
it as a
continual update of what good manners
are
and if you want to have good manners be
there
somebody says they're amazed that
they're agreeing with me four times in
one
periscope um
let's see it's tough to remember i'm
just looking to see if i'm getting much
agreement or disagreement
somebody says okay i'm done i'm not
going to be giving any
any good manners who enforces good
manners well society does i mean we do
it to each other
that's how it works now i would say also
that at the same time you can say people
should be called by the
the words that they prefer i think you
also have to say
that humans are somewhat flawed and
they're not going to get it right all
the time
right if you accidentally call somebody
he
who would prefer to be called ishii or
vice versa
um i fee you know how about just
correcting
it when it's pointed out and how about
just saying oh okay we're
normal people who make mistakes or we
simply didn't know it's not a mistake if
you didn't know
and just allow that it's an imperfect
system it's best you can do
all right enough on that
have you noticed that
there's very little happening in the
news
um i'm kind of hoping for the for trump
to handle
uh the impeachment the way he wants to
which is defending the
the election integrity um or
questioning the integrity of the
election that would be entertaining and
we'd finally have something to talk
about
but biden is just pushing through tons
of stuff
that i don't know how much impact any of
it's going to have on me
i woke up today and it was sort of like
yesterday
i know it's amazing how many things can
change
in the government without any of it
having any impact on you
i mean biden just set some kind of
record for
signing executive orders
i don't know that any of it will affect
me
have you seen have you seen all the
executive orders
do any of them affect you i mean if you
work for
the oil industry you probably get pretty
affected
but beyond that i i just just not seeing
much effect
somebody says you're rich scott
is that why it's not affecting me
okay yeah oil field workers are
definitely affected so the oil industry
is
directly affected for sure
somebody says typical rich guy attitude
well um if there's someone here who is
directly affected by an executive order
except for the oil industry that one's
obvious
let me know what is it what is it that
uh
you've been affected by so far somebody
says gas prices going up but have they
have have they have they gone up already
it seems like they would right but have
they
uh somebody's saying the price for gas
will go up you know i'm not sure that's
that's even predictable anymore because
the demand for gas
i think will be permanently lower
because of
lack of commuting going forward
yeah i've got a feeling that at least in
the short run
gas doesn't have enough demand to go up
but i could be wrong
oh increased costs of insulin yeah
there's one now
when you hear these stories about
trump signed something that would lower
insulin costs but now
biden has reversed it don't you feel
like you're missing a lot of context
i mean do you think that biden got you
know he was given this executive order
to sign
and it said we're going to raise the
price of insulin and he looked at it and
said well that's a good idea
and then he signed it there's got to be
more to that story right
or or is it exactly what it looks like
that the pharmaceutical industry got to
biden and
and he just gave them a gift was it that
i have a feeling that there was an
argument you know
he might have had a reason might have
been a good one might have been a bad
one
but i didn't hear it did you did anybody
hear it
um dc statehood yeah we'll see where
that goes
we'll see where that goes the most
reasonable uh
likely thing that will happen is that
the democrats will overplay their hand
and republicans will surge back
eventually
somebody says okay so scott is just a
date a naysayer
you know i i think my new thing is that
i'm just going to block
anybody who wants to characterize me as
always does one thing so it doesn't
matter what you say i always do
but if you say i always do that thing
you're always wrong
because i don't always agree with trump
i don't always criticize
everything i don't always do anything
so the worst take about me
is you know scott always does this
so okay so scott is a naysayer says this
person that's blocked forever
goodbye mike
so i like it when you make comments
about the content but when you make
global sweeping statements about me that
are stupid
i'll go block those um
he doesn't know what he's signing yeah
who knows what's your best
scott scott has blind spots
what kind of a dumb comment is that
scott has blind spots because
there's people who don't right i i just
gave you
like a whole presentation about how
everybody has blind spots
and then your comment is about me that i
have a blind spot
you know i'm a person right i just went
through a whole thing about
human beings having different blind
spots
so you're gonna get uh
i'm gonna hide you
all right that's it for now and i will
talk to you tomorrow
did i seem grumpy today maybe i
am bye for now
