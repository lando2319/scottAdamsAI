morning everybody
and welcome to what I guarantee will be
the best thing that has ever happened to
you in your life it's called coffee with
Scott Adams
some say
it's underrated
they're all right it's the best thing in
the world not the second best and if
you'd like to take it up a notch
to a level where
we've never been before all you need is
a copper mugger glass attacker the tiger
Chelsea Stein I can't even joke a flask
a vessel of any kind
it could even be a Canadian truck
fill it with your favorite beverage
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine here today you might feel a
little bit of a tingle
jills anybody chills it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now go
only one word can describe this
Sublime
let's try another word
carrot see that didn't work there was
only one word that could
possibly describe that moment
well today is going to be a little bit
mind-blowing I promise you
and we're going to build into it
so watch how this is not just a series
of little Snippets
but by the end you will say to yourself
my God it formed a symphony
at first I thought it was just going to
be the oboe and then a little timpani
but suddenly I realized it all came
together into a symphony that's what's
going to happen today that's how good it
is
starting with a question that uh had
been really on my mind lately and I
wondered if it is it just me
and watch what happens when I ask this
question because I did it on Twitter
watch what's going to happen in the
comments
is it my imagination or if people
changed because of the pandemic I mean
basic personality changes big stuff
go
watch the comments
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes now some knows some people say no
but oh my god did I get a lot of
response to that
a lot of hypotheses
about why that might be the case now
hypothesis number one
has to be what
what's the top hypothesis if I've taught
you anything
it's just in your mind right the top
hypothesis until it's replaced by
something better
which is likely to happen but your first
thought should be that's just in your
mind all right now that's just healthy
thinking
I'm not telling you it's just in your
mind I'm telling you that would be a
healthy way to approach anything unusual
that's probably in our minds
but let's see if we can tease it out a
little bit
here's a couple of things that smart
people said and I'm going to put them
together
one of the things that uh Naval said
Naval ravacant
uh for those of you new to the live
stream or haven't heard his name before
uh smartest person in the world
maybe I mean I don't know that for sure
but if you were to just judge by things
he has said and done
uh maybe the smartest person in the
world all right so you can go Google him
and find out yourself
but uh Naval I'm pretty sure it was
Naval do me a fact check because I'm
doing this by memory
I think he said toward the beginning of
the pandemic that the one of the things
he predicted is that it would accelerate
everything
can you give me a fact Jackie did say
that right he said it would accelerate
everything that was going to happen
anyway so instead of 10 years you know
things would happen in one or two now
how was his prediction
how was that prediction it's a naval
ravacant r-a-v-i-k-a-n-t
um
creator of uh angelist Etc so how was
this prediction did the pandemic speed
up everything
is sped up vaccinations
is sped up uh commuting you know going
away is sped up
um
is sped up online buying is sped up
uh door dashing and food delivery
It sped up a lot of things
and I think there are probably various
technologies that get a kick start
I could speak for myself
I would say that there are things that I
had put off
that I brought forward just because you
know I had time because we were locked
out so even even the you know the
upgrades I did to the live stream
are things that probably would have
taken longer but I accelerated them
because of the pandemic now there might
be other things to slow down like the
you know in the short run the
um the supply chains but in the long run
you know inflation got worse fast just
just the whole international relations
changed fast deaths were yeah even death
was accelerated
it's like everything was faster
so I would say that was a darn good
prediction
now I'm going to combine this with
something I heard recently
um
that Brett Weinstein and I think Heather
haying were saying and I wish tell me
the name of their new book because I'm
such an idiot I was I just looked at it
and then I forgot to write it down
in the comments just say the name of
their new book apparently it's pretty
good I hear good things about it
hunter-gatherer's guide thank you but uh
I I don't know if this is I think this
might be from the book but an interview
I heard him talk about how
humans are the most adaptable
of
really anything that's alive at this
point
now that makes sense right that we
adapted to all kinds of weather and all
kinds of diets and all kinds of
everything and now we're finding this uh
that we uh that we're adapting faster
and faster than we ever had to because
the rate of change in the external world
is so fast that we're we're trying to
keep up with the changes that are
happening in the environment
so we've gone from the you know the the
most adaptive creatures
to having to Super adapt and then the
pandemic hits
and suddenly the pandemic breaks all the
laws all the rules are different like
everything everything you took for
granted is in play now everything
now you've got a super adaptive species
who's trying to figure out how to adapt
but we don't know what the hell is going
on
what are we adapting to
exactly like everything's changing or
I'll adapt to that way well that's
changing okay I got used to okay that
changed so so we're basically in this
state of insane flux because we're so
adaptive
but that doesn't work if the environment
is changing faster than you can adapt
and that's where we're at the minute
what would you expect to happen
what happened here's here's just my
personal hypothesis I'll just throw in
the pile
I think and a lot of you said some
version of this
I think
people were revealed for who they were
all along
I think
that everybody became more
of what they already were
right
everybody became the extreme of what
they started from
if you had a little bit of a weight
problem what happened to you
a lot of people gained weight
if you were a fitness person and I would
say I would be in that category or or
even if your mind was you know oriented
toward that way what happened to you to
you during the pandemic
you got fitter
I'm at my Peak Fitness right now like
I don't want you to have to imagine this
but naked I look better than I've looked
at any time in my life and I'm pushing
65. and a lot of people would say the
same thing there are a whole bunch of
you on here who would say the same thing
leave out the naked part because we
don't need to think about that but
the point is
that let me say that lazy people became
lazier
just just not along as I say these
things because I know you're going to
agree lazy people became lazier
cheaters cheated more
cheaters cheated more
people who were
let's say uh achievement oriented and
again that's the category I would be in
like I'm always thinking about trying to
make something happen achievement
oriented people were even more so they
went into hyper mode
smart people became brilliant
people who were growing a little grew a
lot
things that were failing slowly failed
fast
you know the little stores on Main
Street in my town
it's like they got raked away like
leaves during the pandemic but they were
going to fail anyway it just wasn't
going to be that fast
so here are some other things that
happened which would explain in many
ways
why we're so different
I think that people who were
became more of more
people who are nice became more nice
the the people who were biased toward
helping people and empathy saw a crisis
and they said I was born for this
literally born for it because if you
were born as a sort of empathy kind of a
person well a crisis is actually what
you are born for you know midnight in
the literal way but you know what I'm
talking about you're you're designed
perfectly
for a crisis because you care about
people so you jump right in and help so
the people who are likely to help
were very helpful
the people who are likely to be
worthless
probably became more worthless than ever
everything became more extreme
but the other things that you have to
throw in the mix is
what happened to porn consumption
during the pandemic
I don't have data but I'm going to take
a guess
anybody want to take a guess
without the benefit of any data
probably through the roof
through the roof
uh I talked about the series on HBO I
think called euphoria
it's about young people and you know
working through the culture that's too
much drugs and too much porn and all
that and one of the things that the the
series which is really tries to hit
something close to reality for people in
that age group it talks about how it's
an entire generation that only learned
sex from porn
only and no other source
Because by the time you know you're I
don't know your high school or your
parents got around to it you'd already
consumed so much that it wasn't likely
your opinion was going to get changed
too much
so apparently even you know two young
people looking to hook up
is going to look like pork
or it's going to look like their
imitation of the best they can do to
look like what they've seen because
we're we're an imitative species
so what's that doing to people
well something I mean I don't I'm not
even going to give you an opinion you
know how that's good or bad
you know you can make your own opinions
but it's definitely different it's you
know if you don't think that'll change
your brain
let me ask you you all think that porn
changes your brain right like it
actually rewires you you all get that
right it's only a question of how much
you do
right if you don't do much it's not much
of a big deal
if you do a lot it just becomes it would
just turn you into it and you become it
you you merge with it basically
so there's that then there's the whole
commuting thing what happened when
people were forced to no longer be with
their second family
for a lot of people people had two
families didn't they they had the work
family and then they had the home family
and then the work family went away
what happens if you're buying stocks and
you're not Diversified anybody anybody
you're buying individual stocks and
you're insufficiently Diversified
meaning not enough different stocks
you're going to get wiped out
sooner or later
maybe not right away but if you're not
Diversified you're gonna get wiped out
you have a 90 chance
so there are a whole bunch of people who
had their social life Diversified
meaning you could have a bad day with
your spouse but at least you'd go to
work and there's your friends or you
could have a bad day at work yeah but at
least you could go home and your spouse
is nice to you
what happens when you just take away all
the diversification of your social life
and then then what used to be this Rich
social life becomes your family members
I'm sorry to say this but there's nobody
you can get sicker of faster than your
own family members
right and and they're the people you
love the most yeah you still care about
the most love them you know no no change
in that stuff right that's that's pretty
much baked in but oh my God what stress
to put on marriages
I I I think that you know in the same
way that all the small businesses got
wiped out by the pandemic
I think a lot of relationships got wiped
out by the pandemic
I mean I think the pandemic just and I
don't know that we see the full result
of that you know that's going to work
through the system
so
almost everything was faster
and here's what's happened is I feel
like let me tell you my impression of
what's different
so here's what's different for me
you know I talk a lot about the
simulation too much
but how it feels to me is that I can see
the Machinery of reality in a way that
I couldn't see before or that let's say
maybe I knew about the Machinery of
reality intellectually
just sort of philosophically but I
couldn't see it
I feel at this point
I can see it
it's almost like it's almost like there
was a machine they had a solid front and
now it's a glass front
the machine is exactly the same as it
was but now I can see the mechanisms
and I believe that you're having that
experience too
and it feels as though
Society itself just had his software
Rebooted and we all went to a higher
level of awareness I'm going to make
that case with the headlines today
so here's so here's the theme
the theme that I just developed
that the headlines themselves you can
see the Machinery behind them like
you've never seen before let me run
through some examples
um
Kyle Becker who I tell you all the time
you should follow him on uh
on Twitter he's got a great sort of
great reframings and lots of scoops and
stuff on the news
and he gives us this a little bit of
context about the January 6th situation
he says the Democrats contested
presidential elections three times since
2001. they even argued voting machines
were suspect
there were riots in D.C at Trump's
inauguration
the amount of memory holding these
left-wing news networks do is truly
impressive
now
you see the Machinery right
when I read that you say oh
that's a that's a rupar
in other words the entire January 6
narrative
only works because as Kyle points out
they leave out the context if you put
the context in
if you reverse rupart it
now
I'm not sure that all of you would see
this as instantly even a few years ago
but now it's just automatic isn't it you
just see the machine
here's some more examples
um Lindsey Graham apparently said about
uh Trump potentially pardoning the
January 6 writers
he said quote I think it's inappropriate
so Lindsey Graham thinks it would be
inappropriate if Trump became president
again
to Pardon those people here's a Joel
Pollock
giving you some context he says I want
to hear him explain why the guy with the
Buffalo horns got four years while an
FBI lawyer who doctored an email to
deceive a fisa court in the Russia
collusion probe got
community service
now
you now you you probably haven't heard
it so clearly and well stated before
but you could see that Machinery
couldn't you
we could already see that these were
political prisoners
it's just you know Joel helps us put it
in context there but you can see the
machinery
behind the behind the glass facade
um
and you know of course we've lost all
trust in our institutions as Joel says
in a uh on Twitter they have these what
you need to know sections every now and
then there'll be a topic that Twitter
healthily summarizes you know what you
need to know is usually some bullet
points
so
um I sure hope I
wrote that down
oh
yes I did here it is the what you need
to know so there were one two three four
bullet points so these would be four
things that are so obviously true
they could just be putting a bullet
point to straighten you out all right
I'm going to read them
and then tell me if you don't see the
machinery
behind this
what you need to know the Department of
Justice found no evidence of voter fraud
that could have changed the outcome of
the 2020 election according to former
A.G William Barr
that's one number two election officials
at the Department of Homeland Security
said the 2020 election was the most
secure in American history
number three voter fraud of any type is
extremely rare in the U.S according to
AP and Reuters
and Reuters
and Reuters
Reuters might come up again today
remember that Reuters is one of the
sources for voter fraud of any type is
extremely rare in the U.S
Reuters
just just hold that in your mind for a
while that'll be relevant it's called
foreshadowing
foreshadowing
all right
um and then the last one is 44 States
already have in place some form of
post-election audit the National
Conference on State legislatures website
notes
now
do I even have to go through
what's wrong with all of these
statements the you can see the Machinery
right
well I'll do it quickly just in case you
missed anything the first one all right
the Department of Justice found no
evidence of voter fraud right because
they didn't look for it
that's what's left out
they didn't look for it
they were the wrong vehicle
for judging it they could only judge the
things brought to them in too short of a
Time window to be useful
right that that entire context is left
out
this is clearly propaganda
so you can see the propaganda Machinery
just so clearly now number two election
officials at the Department of Homeland
Security assembly said the election was
the most secure in American history
and they know that how
do they know that
wouldn't that be a case of them knowing
the unknown
do they know that the election of 1940
was fraudulent
well I think what they're saying is that
they have the most
um I would guess my interpretation would
be that they have the most let's say
guard rails in place
to keep us safe
okay now that would be that would be a
reasonably good thing to know we have
the most in history guard rails and and
procedures in place to keep it fair
here's some context I'd like to know
is that enough
does it doesn't it sort of matter sort
of binary isn't it I don't care if it's
the best it's ever been
is it enough
that the most basic question is left out
is it
good enough
are you saying we doubled it from 10
good enough to twenty percent good
enough
the entire context is missing
obviously propaganda
uh voter fraud of any type is extremely
rare in the U.S according to AP and
Reuters Reuters
hold that thought Reuters
we'll do the next one 44 States already
have in place some form of post-election
audit
is it enough
yeah
okay they have some form of
post-election on it
what form
Does it include any of the digital part
doesn't include somebody looking at the
code
I don't think so
some form Now isn't it obvious that
somebody who would write a sentence like
this is not meaning to inform
it is quite quite clear with the four of
these that they are they're designed for
propaganda
for manipulation
and let me ask you was it not obvious to
every one of you when he read it or when
I read it to you I mean I primed you for
it but you saw it right away right
at least my audience does I think
now let me be clear
I am also not aware of any fraud in in
the 2020 election
I have to say that because first of all
it's true
I personally am aware of no fraud
whatsoever I'm not even aware of any
small fraud
because I if there were if there were
any stories like that I wouldn't have
paid attention anyway
somebody says yes you are not bad
no I'm I'm aware of small irregularities
but I don't like to remember the details
because they weren't important if they
were small
uh but I'm aware that people have
reported them so maybe that's what
you're looking for
all right
um what is true let's get into what is
true
and I'll take a little example do you
remember the famous incident uh and of
course you know that all the news has to
go through the Joe Rogan filter now
so it doesn't matter what you're talking
about
it's got to have a Joe Rogan reference
to it and we're gonna have plenty
all right
um do you remember the one of the big
blow-ups was when Joe Rogan had the
Australian guy journalist on
and they disagreed about whether the
vaccination or the virus itself would
cause my more myocarditis
in a certain age group
and that it looked like
maybe the journalist said something
wrong but then Joe Rogan disagreed but
then on the show it looked like Joe
Rogan saw a source that agreed with the
journalist but then we looked at it
later it looked like maybe Joe Rogan was
right after all but then I listened to
another video of a cardiologist who said
would he really dug into it to find out
which of them was right after all that
you can't tell
that's the bottom line so
is the last cardi cardiologist that I
listened to
the one who's right
or is Joe Rogan right
or was the Australian guy right or two
of the three of them right
I don't know but I will tell you if you
listen to a YouTube video of a
cardiologist
talking about how they decided
you know that risk and what data they
had and the quality of the data you will
walk away from it saying
um I'm pretty sure we can't tell
but it all also doesn't matter
and the doesn't matter part is that
whatever the risk is it doesn't matter
even which one's bigger it's so small
it's
it's not part of the decision
so even something as basic as what you
thought about that story
I don't even know if we know that
so our understanding of what is true and
what can be known is completely
different after the pandemic isn't it
everything you thought about the experts
everything you thought about the quality
of the data it's not the same as before
the pandemic now you think that even the
most basic clear story and this one
should have been one
this one should have been
two people you know weren't sure of some
data but then after the episode aired
the experts looked at it and said well
here's what's going on and then they all
agreed because we're all looking at the
same data
but
but things aren't that clear apparently
not
all right here's uh
let's talk about Joe Rogan's video
response so many of you seen it but you
don't need to have seen it in order for
me to you know talk about it so he did a
little uh you know handheld sort of a
self new video that I saw on Instagram
and I guess it's on all the social
platforms by now
in which he talked about the uh
uh the accusations that he's spreading
misinformation about covert stuff and
the Spotify problem of blah blah you
know and uh uh what's his name uh
uh Neil Young
I didn't do that intentionally but that
pretty much summed up the whole story
right there uh Neil Young wanting his
music to be taken off because he thinks
Joe Rogan's spreading misinformation
all right so
uh I listened to Joe Rogan's thing and
my first take which I tweeted but I'm
going to revise in a moment is that it's
the best response I've ever seen
to a public relations problem
that was my first response the best
response I've ever seen
to a public relations brouhaha
I now revise that opinion
it is the second best
response I've ever seen
and I don't think it's a coincidence but
that's just a guess now it would be fun
to hear him confirm or deny this so I
have a hypothesis
and I'm going to tell you who number one
was and see if you can draw a connection
number one was Steve Jobs
Steve Jobs
Steve Jobs when he had his public
relations problem it was one of the
early iPhone models if you put your hand
in a certain place
on the phone it would touch the antenna
and it would you know it would cut off
the call imagine having a handheld
device
that you couldn't hold in your hand
that you paid on a thousand dollars for
whatever the price was
that's like the worst thing that could
ever happen to a company well we made a
handheld object you just can't hold it
in your hand that's the only problem
otherwise it's really spiffy
doesn't make phone calls and it's a
phone but otherwise really good
that's a big problem right here's how
Steve Jobs handled it which became the
stuff of Legends it was actually written
about in his big in his autobiography
and uh sort of a big deal Steve Jobs got
in a call with all the journalists he
said and I'm paraphrasing but this is
the basic idea he said also more all
smartphones have problems we want to
make our customers happy
and then he said here's what we're going
to do
and the next day
because he had reframed it as all
smartphones have problems
the Press instead of killing Apple for
having a phone that had a problem
they started doing stories about all
smartphones had problems
it completely worked now I don't know if
Apple helped to see those stories but
the net effect of it was it really
worked and here is the form that Steve
Jobs used number one reframe
he reframed reframed iPhone as a problem
to all smartphones have problems good
technique
number two
he he showed empathy we want to make our
customers happy a very direct statement
about his customers it wasn't about the
company it wasn't about Steve Jobs
he reframed it and he said we want you
to be happy
then he said we're going to do this to
make you happy and then he set his
solution
very simple
perfect
handling
all right so let me show you the frame
again because we're going to go we're
going to show you this Frame a second
time
you reframe it
you show empathy
and then you give the solution reframe
empathy solution now I don't believe I
think the story is that Steve Jobs did
not come up with that himself
I believe he came up with and I forget
the name of the it was a PR executive
um who was an expert at that
somebody will tell me in the comments if
you've read the biography jobs
anyway
so Steve Jobs has some help from an
expert but Steve Jobs was an expert too
on this
um
somebody will say the the name of it is
it McKenzie
McKesson
McKesson
I don't know it doesn't matter but it
was a professional who was good at it
now let's talk about uh Joe Rogan's
um
thing
Joe Rogan basically said
and today actually not write that down I
don't think that's possible
um so here's here's how he started his
first reframe was he talked about his
show being a conversation
That Grew big unexpectedly
I'm paraphrasing now but he says I'm
just talking to people about stuff
that's interesting to me
and that it grew into this big thing
and so that's the context the context is
I'm not the news
right that's pretty important because
the context is that you know allegedly
misinformation
so the first frame is I'm this is just a
conversation of something interesting
not the news now he didn't say I'm not
the deuce but that's the context
um
so he reframes it
and he said basically There's No Agenda
it's just interesting stuff and he also
talked about how the experts he's had on
some of them would have been banned and
he claims
four things that in in the end ended up
being right
so that he gives you further context
that says
how many times he has a specific
examples of people who said things that
the mainstream would have said no that's
dangerous and then they turned down to
be right
so that's good context all right so like
jobs
uh Joe Rogan reframes the situation
then
he shows empathy
you basically
agrees with his critics and he and then
he tells you what he's going to do about
it
reframe
empathy
solution
perfect
now the solution would be you said that
he probably does need to get the an
expert who disagrees with you know some
of the provocative people get them on
you know close to when the provocative
person was
and he said that he does his own
scheduling
and that he needs to do that you know
more
uh I don't want to say better but he
just wants to pair the differing
opinions so they're a little closer
together
which is you know is a form of what I'd
been suggesting as well now I thought
it's even better if they're there at the
same time but maybe that's hard to
manage but the bet the next best thing
is to show the expert and then the
counter experts you know be as close as
possible so he's at least acknowledged
uh the the nature of the
uh complaints and then he offered some
solutions and then he also said he'd
prepare better for some of the some of
the types of experts
now
uh
here's David Smith Scott loves sucking
up to Big Pharma
sheep Rogan is accepting a
misinformation tag on his show week
all right
the the the the the people who only see
things as like weak or sheep the you're
like binary idiots
so get rid of this binary idiot
goodbye
all right um you've got to handle a
little bit of nuance
to uh to enjoy this live stream
all right
um
so I would say here's my speculation
one of the things that Joe Rogan gets
right
is what I'll call the The Norm Macdonald
uh theory of of comics
comedians that is Norm Macdonald
explained once I saw it on a video
recently that you don't want to act
smarter than your audience you want to
act dumber than your audience but maybe
you know I think I'm adding this part
but maybe a surprise them that that your
stuff hangs together better than they
think right
Joe Rogan
does an insanely good job of what a good
comic does and remember he's got this
whole Talent stack working you know
stand-up comic you know and then plus
all the other skills acting blah blah
so
so I don't know how much is you know
knowing what systems work and borrowing
them I don't know how much is natural
can't read minds but when you see uh one
of the things that makes Joe Rogan so
popular is he doesn't ever let himself
look like he's smarter than you
right
that is sort of Genius because it is
it's a hard thing to do if you think
maybe you've got some of your success
because you were smart
you know you'd have to think that in his
private moments he might have some
positive thoughts about his own
intelligence
you know he got him where he is right
now here's my take
if you know I'll make this conditional
my guess is that when the the thing blew
up with Spotify and Joe Rogan that he's
now playing at a let's say a corporate
level I hate to say it but you know
because Spotify is involved there's sort
of a corporate
element to this
it would surprise me if Spotify did not
offer
to give him some professional crisis
management PR advice
via somebody like Steve Jobs got the
advice
so my guess is that in both cases Steve
Jobs and Joe Rogan got advice from the
best advice givers
you could possibly get advice from
but that's not good enough
right because if most people got the
greatest advice in the world they a
wouldn't recognize it right they
wouldn't recognize it as good advice you
have to be pretty smart to even
recognize it and then secondly they
couldn't implement it
because it takes a lot a lot of
communication skill and most important
um Reserve
like to hold back all of your normal
instincts to give the the perfect
three-part you know response that both
of them did so here's the thing
if Joe Rogan got advice from an expert
he did a really good job of following
the advice like really good
but
if Joe Rogan came up with this
spontaneously
which has the look of it has the look of
something where he'd been thinking about
it for a while picked up his phone
and then gave you 10 minutes of
perfection that could have happened
I don't know and I would love to know
because if he did that
spontaneously after thinking about it a
lot of course but if that was one take
spontaneous
and he hit the the three elements that
cleanly
that is one of the smartest things
you've ever seen in your life
that that that would be just insanely
smart and like the amount of skill that
would go into that
it would be hard to hard to imagine so I
would just love to know I don't know if
you'll ever
talk about it but I'd be real curious if
he got expert advice or if he if that
was just spontaneous that would be
really interesting
um
from Reuters
this came from Reuters
and it reported that uh
uh Ivermectin was effective against
Omicron in a phase three trial wow
wow that's big news
you know everybody's saying bad things
about Ivermectin but here's Reuters
today
saying that I've remectedly in a
Japanese study that is effective it is
effective against Omicron in a phase
three trial holy cow
wow
uh that fake news lasted uh I believe
less than one minute
it's not true
it took it took me one minute to say
well that's a pretty vague claim because
you look at it and there's no link to a
study
like it just look obviously untrue
because
I could see the machinery
now I didn't really have to like break
it down or anything I just looked at it
I just looked at the story and I said
well that's
somewhat transparently not true
now I'm not talking about diaphragmactin
right this has nothing to do with
Ivermectin it's just about the truth of
a story
and then it took uh Andre's back house
another like five seconds
to completely dismantle it and he goes
he goes he goes uh this news feels too
basic sanity checks one there is no
preprint or other documentation yet and
then two assuming they did the trial in
Japan Omicron became dominant there just
one month ago one month isn't a
realistic time frame for a whole trial
and I'm thinking
yeah okay
and by the time I had read that uh that
Reuters had already corrected the story
and took out the phase three trial part
which was the ridiculous part
basically they found out that Ivermectin
Works in a lab
which
we already do in other words there
wasn't any news
there wasn't any news at all
do you know what else Works in a in a
test tube against diseases
practically everything do you know what
kills a virus
I don't know you could probably piss on
it
and I think pretty much everything kills
it in a lab yeah Coca-Cola in a lab so
basically this is Reuters reporting
something that wasn't even close to
being credible or true
it was but remember my original point
the pandemic has allowed us to see the
machinery
you could just see this one you didn't
even have to analyze it oh that's that's
not true
all right
uh Pat Sajak uh
passage had this tweet you said I've
discovered that no matter how
outlandishly over the top satirical
sarcastic or ridiculous the Tweet
approximately 20 percent of Twitter
users who comment will take it at face
value
helps explain why there's so much anger
out there
well
I think Pat was off by
five percentage points
uh as I've been noting 25 percent or so
ish people will be wrong about anything
everything
to the point where I got a tweet just
before I came on or or was it maybe I
saw it on a Local's comment I'm
forgetting where I saw it that maybe it
just might be uh is part of the uh base
rules of our reality
you know the base rule of reality is
around 25 percent of people have to
misunderstand everything
it's a different 25 percent I hope I
hope it's not the same 25 but there
always has to be the standard 25 no
matter what
all right
um one more thing and then I'm going to
solve the Ukraine problem
um we have to only start looking at
unvaccinated people and uh I'm sorry
we have to look at only fully vaccinated
deaths
to make our decisions on the mandates
fully vaccinated deaths we've been doing
the wrong thing we've been looking at
unvaccinated deaths but that's the group
that chose that option
right
but if all the unvaccinated people are
completely happy with their risk
management decision and they are
they are
and all of the vaccinated people they've
seen the risk drop to the point where
it's now a baseline risk not a pandemic
risk why are we looking at the deaths of
the unvaccinated they're getting exactly
what they want
not the dead ones but the people who
lived got exactly what they wanted
and the people who died they chose a
path that they were fully informed about
they didn't believe it and that was
their option
so
if you looked at the total deaths
vaccinated and unvaccinated it looks
like we're at a record and that would be
a bad argument for ending mandates
but if you look at what people asked for
and what they got
vaccinated people asked for vaccinations
they got it unvaccinated people asked
for a different risk profile
they got it as long as the hospitals can
handle the load and it looks like they
can
at this point it looks like they can
we're done
tomorrow ladies and gentlemen
and people of all types
Regis McKenna is the Regis mechanic was
the person who advised Steve Jobs I
don't know if he advised him on that
question I was talking about thank you
very much it was Regis McKenna
um
so February 1 is the date that the
public takes over
uh because our government has not and I
believe that the argument should be that
everybody got what they wanted at this
point the vaccinated got what they
wanted the unvaccinated would got what
they wanted
we are done
I would argue that the worst way to
protest at this point is with trucks
because
don't we need the stuff in those trucks
anybody
uh I think we need this stuff in the
trucks
I don't think we should stop the supply
chain
for anything
that's just my thinking but here's what
we should do
we should just take control just take
off your mask if you go in a place that
requires them make sure that they ask
you to put it on and then the first
thing you should say is no after
February 1st the public took control of
the mandates
and people say no the government still
hasn't mandate and you'll say yeah I
know that's why the public took control
on February 1st
now if they put up a fight well you can
decide to leave or put on your mask
that's up to you but I'm just saying
the default should be take the mask off
now I probably won't
you know just personally I probably
won't try you know going to Walmart or
Target or anything
but I'll just stay away from any places
that I know will require a mask and any
place I think is a soft target I'll go
in and take it off
and
we should just see it yeah I know people
be you know more rebellious than I am
we're going to try to get on planes and
everything else but that that would be a
little bit dangerous at this point I
don't think I'd mess around with an
airport
but the point is we have to make it a
big enough deal that the Press starts
talking about it
if the Press doesn't talk about the
public taking control of the issue and
make that a theme
it just wasn't going to happen
right so you need the press to
understand this is a perfect story
the Press does not like dog bites man
because that's normal the Press likes a
man bites dog the Press doesn't care if
the government tells you what to do
that's normal the Press does care when
the when the public tells the government
what to do that's that's what makes it a
story so somebody needs to talk about
the public Rebellion until the narrative
catches on and then it snowballs but
let's let's kick this thing off now
let's uh tell you how to handle the
Ukraine problem
have you ever wondered what the hell do
you do when you're dealing with a
dictator
like you could never you never really
solve a problem with a dictator right
it's very unlikely that democracies will
fight you know two Democratic countries
rarely get into war right
so if there is a war it's going to be
two dictators or a dictator and a
democracy
Etc
so wouldn't wouldn't you love it if
there was some way to solve the problem
that there's no way to make peace with a
dictator because they kind of have to
stay dictators
to avoid getting killed
am I right
it's hard to be a dictator and then just
retire
because whoever takes over next will
kill you and wipe out your entire family
now what does a what does a dictator
want after a certain age let's say by
Putin's age what does he want
probably something like a legacy
probably something like keeping his uh
his genetic line safe
do you feel that that would be a safe
thing to say at a certain age there
they're less about acquiring stuff and
more about making sure that what they
have done becomes a permanent Legacy
both to protect the people in their
family after they're gone
but also so their name will live on
so how do you how can you solve this
problem of giving the dictator something
that protects them in that way after
they're gone
but also allows you to negotiate in some
productive way so I think is this is the
reframe that needs to happen
we should we should talk to our
dictators about the fact that if they
keep with their current model it's
inevitable that their bloodline is going
to get wiped out
meaning that whoever takes over after
them
is going to look for your relatives and
make sure they get out of there because
the relatives are the dangerous ones
right
so how can you keep your relatives and
your legacy
from being erased and canceled
and here's the way to do it
guarantee everybody who sticks within
their borders
as they exist today
that they will be supported against all
attacks forever
in other words give them job security
instead of trying to depose them it's
the whole deposing them that gets the
problem right if we're trying to depose
uh Putin all the time
well he's going to push back
like anybody's going to push back so can
we remove the incentive for them to be
hacking us and and poking us back
I think we can
because I'm not terribly concerned if
the Russian people have a dictator are
you
I mean really
because I feel like maybe a lot of them
prefer it
I think maybe a lot of them prefer it is
not our problem
so instead of trying to turn anybody
into uh you know into some kind of a
democracy so that we can be friends why
don't we do it the Trump way
Trump goes to North Korea and says you
know there's no reason we need to be
enemies
how about uh if you want some economic
development we should talk
and then Kim Jong-un is like um
I can't think of a reason I need to be
your enemy
and then for a while
everything was heading in the right
direction
and and the thing that Trump did was he
gave Kim Jong-un
job security
think about it that's what Trump did
he gave Kim Jong-un job security the
most he's ever had and as soon as he had
job security he got friendly
friendlier
now Biden comes along
and no longer does
Kim have a relationship that's like a
personal one with the president
and now suddenly he's testing a lot of
rockets
right it's probably not an accident
um so
could we say here's the deal
as long as you stay within your
International borders
the entire world will make sure you
don't get deposed
the entire world China us you know we'll
make sure that President XI stays in
power as long as he wants Putin long as
you want Kim Jong-un forever
but
you have to
you have to end the the poking us
in other words you can't invade your
neighbors anymore and you can't Cyber
attack us you can't be trying to
undermine our currency and stuff like
that like you're going to just have to
be a productive competitor in the world
and then you can have everything you
want you just can't change your National
borders anymore
now
would that work
I don't know
but what we're doing now doesn't work
would you agree that what we're doing
now doesn't work
you know we have to do the we're
stronger than them Putin Only Knows for
us well Putin does only know Force
because it's the only option
what other option has he been offered
has he ever been offered the option
you're going to be in you're going to be
you can have the job forever just don't
be so much of an
that's it
you could you could be our friend I
don't care just don't be an to
us and you can have your job forever
now
I don't know if that would work of
course right and you know it'd be
different for every situation no two
situations are the same but
I can't see a reason that we are at some
kind of War footing with Russia
can you
I feel like
a infantile position I I feel as though
we lost the reason
we lost the reason
now the reason is of course that they're
going to be aggressive so we have to
keep them in and they're thinking you
know U.S is going to be aggressive so we
have to keep them in well what if we
just weren't
there's no reason
it's just two people who are locked in
this model that doesn't make sense
anymore the last people we want to have
a war with is freaking Russia it's last
let's have a war with anybody else but
Russia anybody
literally lasts on my list
uh of course you know they they make it
easy to Gin up War because of the way
they act but let's figure out a way to
change their incentive all right
that
is my incredible live stream program for
the day
probably the best thing you've ever seen
in your entire world
I'd like to show you one more uh thing
to show you the machinery
of
um
oh stupid phone
stupid stupid damn phone all right I
guess I'll do it the long way
here's a picture that the LA Times uh
ran
about the Joe Rogan and Neil Young
controversy
all right
and
uh look at the picture they chose for
Joe Rogan
and look at the picture that they chose
God damn it I chose for uh
Neil Young
so Neil Young he doesn't look like a
heroin addict he looks like a thoughtful
possibly a brilliant man
Joe Rogan the pictures that they picked
they picked the AOC picture with the
with the big eyes
and and here's the headline this is from
the uh LA Times Spotify CEO Daniel Eck
responded to Neil Young and others
removing their music from the platform
over a covid-19 misinformation spread on
Joe Rogan's popular uh podcast
so they say it likes it like it's a fact
that it was misinformation
isn't a fact
is it a fact that it was misinformation
or is it experts disagreeing
so they treat it like it's a fact like
you don't need to think anymore you see
the Machinery right
you could you can see the machinery
so
that my friends is the best show ever
and YouTube
um
I will talk to you tomorrow
