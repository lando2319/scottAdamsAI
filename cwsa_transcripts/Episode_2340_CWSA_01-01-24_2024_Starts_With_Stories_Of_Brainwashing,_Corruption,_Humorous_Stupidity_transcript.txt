good morning everybody and welcome to
2024 and also the show this is the most
amazing thing you're going to see today
because most of the other people are on
vacation but not me no every day here
like clockwork it's called dependability
and if you'd like to take this
experience up to a level that you can
barely understand all you need is a CER
mug glass a tiger chal Stein a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Up
ab now
go or as uh Jill Biden likes to say
about Joe and ice cream and ice cream
well let's talk about the news uh Mickey
Mouse is officially well only the 1928
version of Mickey Mouse is officially
off of copyright
protection
so if you want to use Mickey Mouse only
the black and white
original don't use the modern one I
guess you can
now it took approximately 7.6 seconds
for somebody to use AI to make
themselves their own Mickey Mouse uh
Mickey Mouse
animation uh you can see Brian remell is
already tweeting about that that didn't
take long well feel bad for Japan they
had a 7.6 earthquake with some minor
tsunamis uh
7.6 correct me if I'm wrong but isn't
that bigger than any earthquake in
America ever or at least since we've
been keep keeping track of
them we've never had anything like that
in America have
we no somebody says yes no oh in Alaska
somebody says Alaska was
bigger okay
1906 could we really measure it in
1906 could we maybe Alaska added 9.3
wow holy
cow no I don't know that is all
right well I saw the videos and I didn't
see did not see damage that looked like
7.6 damage but it's pretty
bad but uh I'm going to scratch that off
my list of places to move
to do you know what scares
me more than just about
anything being on any kind of an island
nation that has natural
disasters that that that's the problem
with
Hawaii because you got your tsunami risk
and you got your volcano risk and you
got your North Korea is going to Nuke
you
risk where the hell do you
go I I know it's it's more psychological
than real but the thought of being
on the thought of being on the the
island of Japan when there's a tsunami
and a 7.6 earthquake it just feels
uncomfortable I don't know I think it
going
to Santorini blew up no it
didn't did
it all right uh there's apparently a new
car Chinese car company backed by
Volkswagen has a new car coming out this
month that will not have a lithium ion
battery so there's now going to be a
real electric car that has a different
technology for the battery
uh which is sort of a really big deal
it's a sodium ion battery so it's got
some disadvantages it's lower density so
you have fewer miles but apparently it
operates better in the
cold so I don't think there are any
there are few things that would be more
positive going into
2024 than competing Battery
Technology especially if one of them
does not require uh
lithium so that's a small story that
might be a big story could be a big
deal well let's talk about backwards of
science backwards science that's science
that we might have the causation
backwards and this time I am guilty
that's right I have made the mistake of
reversing my causation maybe I'm I'm
going to give myself partial credit
because I think the causation works both
ways but here's the question do you
think that smartphone use makes
teenagers uh more depressed and more
anxious yes or no does smartphone use
make teenagers more depressed and more
anxious well I've been saying it's
obvious that it
does but uh I saw a note on X from uh
Doctor Val
zudans who says there's a slate of hand
in the causality
you have my attention doctor what are
you trying to say and the doctor thinks
that it's just as likely that the
causation goes the other way that if you
are anxious and depressed you might
reach for your phone as part of your
relief for your anxiousness and your
depression how many of you would accept
that that is likely true that being
depressed and anxious makes you reach
for your phone as opposed to reaching
ing out to human beings to spend time
with yeah I think so so I'm going to
accept this Cora this coration direction
but I think it's got to be
both uh to me it's obvious as
both right would you agree well you know
once you hear this you say to yourself
yeah that's probably right it probably
does reinforce itself but I think also
it's causing it so so I would guess it's
both but it's a little bit backward
science so I'll take that
criticism um I saw one one commentary
called the Jiggler just a person on the
xplatform and uh I won't use his
language but he's suggesting that young
men are less attracted to young women
and they have less to work for and
therefore uh they're not happy because
there's nothing to work
for what do you think of that do you
think that young men are saying to
themselves well I don't really have the
goal yeah yeah when I was a young man it
seemed obvious that everybody needed to
grow up and find themselves a good woman
and get
married and you know we we're all sort
of you know brainwashed into thinking
that was the model now
that also gave a sense of
purpose I felt that as a male in America
I had a clear purpose you were supposed
to get a job and contribute you were
supposed to get married and you know be
a productive part of the society Etc
but all of those good intentions how did
how did I compress those good intentions
into my teenager mind all that stuff
about being a good citizen and getting a
job and how do how did I think about it
as a teenager well what I thought about
was I should would like to be worthy of
having a really good
mate I probably use more coarse language
in my teenage mind but you know what I
talk about like I thought that I had to
make myself into a creature that could
uh be worthy of having a a family or a
spouse and so that was like a mission I
knew what to do every day when I woke up
I'd wake up and I'd be like okay am I
learning something today because I'm
going to need to learn something am I
getting healthier am I exercising am I
improving my body did I you know work on
the things I need to work on did I
figure out how to talk to people so I
always felt like I knew exactly what I
needed to
do but um just to explore this point
Point made by the Jiggler he calls
himself um do you think there's
something to the point that if you
remove the incentive it changes the
behavior of the
people it always does do you think that
the incentive for teenagers is less
because when they look at the real world
they're not seeing much that they like
compared to what we did as you know when
I was a kid and when they look at porn
they like it a lot and they look at
their phone they like it a lot but human
beings are worth less because they made
themselves worth
less you know you see a lot of the uh
people on social media I'm not sure I
agree with this but it's becoming a a
common theme that uh the men are saying
and again this is not my opinion I'm
describing what men on social media are
saying so the people who propose that
they are experts in relationships or
they act like they are they say that the
women are degrading their value by
having lots of what they call body count
in other words lots of sexual partners
now how many would you how many of the
men watching this would agree with the
somewhat sexist view that the value of a
woman goes down the more sexual partners
she has had before you mate with her now
I'm not going to agree with that or
disagre that I'm just going to tell you
what the comments are almost all
yes it's a wall of yes with a sprinkling
of
NOS all right so if it's a wall of
yes um I'm going to separate from the
question of whether that's a valid or
fair or you know woke opinion I'm not
going to deal with whether it's true or
false I will simply note it's a common
opinion that did not exist because it
didn't need to when I was a
kid so if you take the female population
and you remove its value to the young
men what would be the uh what would be
the effect on the mental health of the
young men who basically wake up every
day with one purpose in life being
valuable to that class of
people you wake up and there's no point
what's the point what would be the point
of exercising and being healthy and
making a lot of money and what are you
chasing you're not chasing anything
so I I'm just sort of spitballing here I
don't want to get into the question of
whether having a lot of sex partners
makes you less valuable I feel that's a
little creepy and maybe none of my
business and I don't know what the
science is on that so I'm not going to
weigh into that but you can see that
it's a common
opinion now if men if men see the value
of the potential women they would be
chasing as much lower they see the that
the value they can add to the woman is
much lower than it used to be because a
woman can get a job and buy a gun and
protect yourself and if you see that
porn went from being kind of interesting
to all men
to really addictive because now they can
give you exactly what you want you know
it's not it's not this generic stuff of
the old days these two dumpy people
humping it down on a black and white
film now you can exactly what you want
and it's a big difference so it makes
sense that mating and our entire social
structure is being ripped apart by these
modern forces no big surprise but uh
let's talk about Sam Britton Britain you
know Sam Britain he was Biden's he used
to be the top nuclear expert in the
administration but he was accused of
stealing luggage from three different
airport
carousels yeah but uh the news was that
uh apparently he's still free so
stealing luggage three separate times
does not put you in jail at least right
away but um here's what I feel bad about
Sam Britain is going to have trouble
forming personal relationships in the
future you know why
right too much
baggage yeah that's your first dad joke
of 2024 you're welcome you're welcome
too much
baggage well there's a fake news story
about Bill Clinton being unmasked as doe
36 uh and he's mentioned more than 50
times in the Jeff in the new Jeffrey
Epstein document
dump so that's bad for Bill Clinton
right because he's named 50 times in the
new Epstein document dump so wow 50
times that's a lot lot is fake news do
you know why it's fake
news most of the references are people
talking about
him it's not anything he did yeah it
makes it sound like he did 50
things that have to do with Epstein no
there were simply people who mentioned
him 50 times in various contexts that
was it so do I think that Bill Clinton
is totally innocent from all suspicious
activity on Epstein Island no no I don't
know one way or the other but I will
tell you that the news is it's designed
to make you think there's more there
than they found what's there I don't
know but this document dump added
absolutely nothing to our knowledge of
Bill Clinton and
Epstein everybody agree if you've looked
at the article is my take correct that
there was literally nothing added to our
knowledge of Bill Clinton about
anything I don't think it added
anything all right we'll see maybe
more
um would you like uh would you like to
feel better about the future you know we
we always tell all these stories about
the the children of this generation are
all destroyed and bad and blah blah blah
all right here's something I heard from
a young person
yesterday and and I want you to just
feel how encouraging this is it won't
your first reaction might be well that's
not very encouraging Scott but let us
sink in just let us sink in this is from
a young person I overheard yesterday
quote that whole Helen Keller story
sounds
suspicious what do you
think come on that's the best thing
you've heard all year
well it's
early how much do you love the fact that
we finally got to the point where a
young person who maybe is not completely
steeped in what's new in the news but
even a young person is completely aware
that just because 100% of the media told
you that Helen Keller did these things
which sound miraculous and almost
impossible it doesn't mean it
happened that's it
that that's your key to the best future
you could
live I want to hear a young person say
without any prompting you without
hearing a story in the media listen to a
story that sounds a little bit
incredible and say out loud I'm not so
sure that's even
true now I have no idea whether the hell
and Keller's story is 100% true and I
don't care what I
love is that there's a young person who
heard it and said you know what I'm a
little bit
skeptical thank you thank you young
people maybe maybe there's some
hope all right uh Wall Street Journal
was giving some uh scores to Joe Biden
for his promises and how he kept them
and they rated him on the economy
immigration foreign policy climate and
criminal justice which of those five
things do you think he got the highest
score on well the answer is climate so
he only got two NFI for economy
immigration foreign policy and criminal
justice but on climate you got three
stars and a five that's right on the
topic that probably isn't even
real he did a little better than
average the topics which we're pretty
sure are completely real didn't do much
at all so the seems to be a pattern that
he does really well well really really
well on topics that are completely fake
or could be don't
know uh here's a little context from
Michael schellenberger on Harvard's
president president gay so as you know
she's uh embattled is that a good word
embattled so she said some inelegant
things about uh Hamas and Israel and
people asked her to resign
and uh of course she's hanging on trying
not to lose her
job and then separately she came in
under Fire for what people said was
plagiarism but other people said was
maybe a little bit too much duplicative
work no no not any kind of plagiarism
but a little bit uh maybe a little bit
too
duplicative sort of sort of thing but
here's some
background um Harvard's president this
is from Michael shellenberger Harvard's
president Rose to power after attempting
to force a black Economist Roland frier
out of the university on the basis of
weak and poorly substantiated sexual
harassment charges when her real
motivation appeared to be Friar's
research finding on racial inequality
and policing which were antithetical to
woke
ideology
oh did you know that now there's a
little bit of a little bit of mind
reading in this to be fair because we
don't know what she was thinking but the
interpretation based on her actions is
that her real problem with this uh black
Economist Roland frier was that his work
was not supporting her her opinion of
racial situation in the country so she
forced him out took the job and made
diversity hiring look like a really bad
idea so that wasn't a good good year for
her but I didn't know about that
background that she'd uh been one of the
factors in forcing out Roland
frier but I do
believe that he was forced out because
if um his work was not
popular that that does seem fair so you
know I'm saying Michael shellenberger
doing some mind reading but so am I
because I think in this case it's
obvious could be wrong you don't know
what people are thinking for sure but it
looks like
it all right Laura lomer had a
fascinating post about something called
it contingent
elections which I never heard of do you
know what that is a contingent election
in the United
States so listen to this and I will ask
you if if I've got this
wrong
so there might be something I have wrong
about this now the the trigger for even
talking about this is RFK Jr's uh
Campaign which could have the effect if
he does well of at the end of the
election nobody has 270 electoral votes
now you need that to be president so
what do you what do you do if you have
an election in the United States and
nobody after a few rounds can get enough
to be president of according to the
Constitution well it turns out that
triggers a different
process called a contingent
election and apparently whoever is in
control of the house can just sort of
pick whoever they want for president so
if the Republicans have a majority they
could if long as they all agree they
could just sort of pick a
president I'm not entirely sure the
president has to be running for office
is that even a
requirement can can the Congress pick
somebody who was not even in the
election just randomly pick somebody
from among their own
ranks
yeah well each state gets one
vote um but it's going to depend who
controls the party as
well well what do you think so I don't
know um if I understand the uh constit
tional ins and outs of this completely
but there does seem to be some nonzero
chance that the election won't be what
picks the
president maybe it's bigger than nonzero
huh what do you think is this
real and why and why are we hearing for
about it for the first
time under uh Laura lum's
account I I feel like this would be an
article in the hill or something I don't
know I feel like there's more to know
about this so I'm going to put a tack in
this story put a tack in this one and
just assume you you don't know exactly
the details of this thing but there's
something out there floating around
about maybe our process could be
thwarted under a certain specific set of
circumstances anyway
um here's uh Bruce Bane who's on the
xplatform uh who gives us a lesson in
what he calls money laundering
101 this might be stuff you already know
but every now and then I like to remind
you how it's all connected so it's not
new news it's just connecting old news
here are the things that uh Bruce
reminds us of the CIA led a Ukrainian
coup in
2014 I think we know that to be true
right the 2014 Q was the US was behind
it all right so then the CIA and the US
create a proxy war with Russia that
sounds about right then the US sends a
huge amount of money to zinski true and
then this next part I need a fact check
on this is this true that zinsky then uh
donated well not donated but uh invested
in FDX the big crypto scamming thing did
that really
happen did zelinsky take American money
and put it into FTX as an
investment that's
true well let me read the rest I need a
fact check on that I haven't seen I have
not seen that credibly reported I've
seen it on social media but if there's a
credible report that zalinsky put money
into FTX can you send me that link on X
it probably is I'm not saying it's not
true I'm just saying I haven't seen that
credibly
reported anyway so then FDX files uh FDX
gives a bunch of money to
politicians and then they file for
bankruptcy and then the US dropped at
least some of the charges against SPF
not all of them I don't know does that
whole thing look dirty to you like it
was all connected part of a plan or does
it look like just a bunch of things that
happened it doesn't look like a plan it
looks like an
opportunistic situation that was
corrupt
anyway um some time ago we believe that
uh the Tesla robot called Optimus would
be launched in December that just passed
which means it could be imminent does
anybody have an estimate I haven't seen
when I looked for it uh of when Tesla
will launch his robot that's going to be
this year
right if they were planning at the end
of this last year probably we're looking
at the middle of this year if if they
didn't hit that
Target
tomorrow
maybe well here's what's interesting I
don't think we can understand how much
that might change the
world how quickly let let me do a poll
of the viewers here how many of you
would buy I'm going to put a price on it
does everybody know what the price of
Optimus will be it's going to be crazy
expensive the first ones right will it
be like $100,000 or 20,000 does anybody
have any
idea I can't imagine it would be less
than
20 but I don't think you can sell many
if it's over a 100
somebody says
2025
unclothed Elon said 20 did I literally
just guess the price that El said did
that just happen because I I don't think
the first ones will be priced based on
their
cost the first ones will have to be
priced based on what people will buy and
then if they can make enough of them
maybe they can lower their cost
structure but the first ones will just
be money losers for know a few
years 20 is a target
20,000 all right let's say you could get
a a Optimus for $20,000 a robot you
could use it at home for whatever you
want and you could teach it things like
doing your ironing and emptying the
dishwasher how many of you would get one
in version 1.0 knowing that the software
will keep improving so it'll it'll keep
getting better how many would get one
I feel like I might be version
1.1 maybe not
1.0 maybe not 1.0 but 1.1 if 1.0 looks
good for the people who got it h
1.1 I might wait into that I would
definitely want a robot walking around
my house for
20K if it could really do chores if it
could you know the other thing I would
want it to do is made notes for
me if I could just have my robot hanging
around and make notes here's what I'd
love to do hey robot um here's like
three things I need to do today can you
remind me and uh it'd be nice if you
just send it to the
printer and I walk over and I take from
my printer a perfectly formatted list
just because I talk to my robot and then
the robot sent it to the printer that'd
be cool I'd want that right away
you already have that ability not
perfectly
formatted I guess that's the difference
all right um did you see Joe Biden's a
year receive interview with Ryan
CEST oh my
God that was
cringy so somehow it looks like it was
live that means that they made Biden
stay up till midnight
do you know what Biden at midnight looks
like the first question was something
about what he's
eating because that's why you ask the
president of the United States hey how
about the food what are you eating
tonight and it appeared that he had to
read the answer from the
teleprompter I believe that the
president of the United States had to
read notes to tell us what food he likes
and what he eats and then Jill had to
lean over after he said he likes pasta
and you know cuz it's
funny she men you'd like ice cream oh
that's so funny oh you're so you're so
friendly and just like regular people
that's what I thought I was like you're
just like regular people you talk like
you joke you kid around just like
regular people yeah how about your ice
cream so that was pretty sad one of the
things he said though was
that um he's brought a lot of jobs back
from China because we set our
manufacturing over to China and lost our
jobs but Joe says he's brought brought
back those
jobs have you seen any indication that
anything like that has
happened now I do believe he is
succeeding and I I will give him full
credit for this full credit for
certainly making some movement about you
know reshoring some of the companies and
moving them to other countries countes
basically getting out of China I do
think he's
done a a nontrivial job in that
direction
but I feel like all of that has turned
into maybe they're trying to build a
factory but they haven't hired anybody
yet right what kind of jobs did it
create I don't believe he's brought back
even one manufacturing job to America
now I know that Vietnam has spent up and
Mexico is spinning up but that's not
American
workers and I know that uh some chip
companies are you know in advanced
planning and even construction to you
know build a plant but it's not built
yet isn't the number of manufacturing
jobs he took back to
America
zero am I wrong about that I feel like
it's actually literally zero now again I
will compliment him he seems to be
putting the right amount of
energy into making sure that we can
reclaim some of that you know
manufacturing but it's going to take a
while I think he might get be getting
ahead of his uh of his good
work yeah you know it's going to be
strange about
2024 it's going to look like
everything's going
well you are you ready for that because
it's an election year and because the
news wants things to look good when
Biden's president there will be a
narrative forming it's already formed
but 20 24 is going to look like the year
everything went
right unless it happens in another
country which they can't control but
it's going to look like everything went
right in 2024 you're going to see that
inflation goes down the stock market
looks pretty good you're going to see
customer optimism because the news will
tell them to be optimistic you're going
to see employment will probably stay
good enough you're going to see us
winding down two Wars probably or or at
least you know we won't be getting more
involved in the Middle East you'll
probably see Saudi Arabia and Israel
I'll talk about this in a minute do
something constructive you're probably
going to see some manufacturing as Joe
said come back to this country good work
on that Joe Biden you're probably going
to see just a whole bunch of things that
look like good
news is that real
well we'll believe it's real I also
believe the immigration will start to
substantially decrease as we get close
to the election it won't be real but it
will it'll be a story that can tell that
they're on the way to solving it so
they'll tell the story that it's working
even if it's not so the thing you should
watch out for is if you feel all uh
confident that the Republicans have you
know good polling substantial
lead they've created 800,000
manufacturing jobs since I've taken
office oh and he got fact checked on it
let me look at that figure is 175 higher
than the F Peak it's more accurate to
say
589 jobs were
recovered okay so he's exaggerating
about the number of jobs recovered which
is same thing all the presidents
do
uh so uh here's what you should be ready
for you should be you should assume that
no matter how badly Trump is beating
Biden in the polls for the next several
months that by
Spring it's going to tighten up and
Biden should pull ahead do you know why
because everything will be going well
that's what the news will tell you that
doesn't mean it's true but the news is
going to tell you everything is trending
well so and people will be completely
brainwashed by the news as they always
are and they're going to say to
themselves why should we take a risk on
this provocative Trump guy when
everything's going in the right
direction see the problem if you don't
see the size of that risk it's
enormous the biggest risk for
2024 is that everything looks like it's
going well
because that's how you get another four
years of
Biden and the news is absolutely going
to tell you it's going well absolutely
now at the moment it seems that the news
is trying to push Joe out of the
job but at some point if they start to
think that's not going to happen around
the spring they're going to completely
line up behind him because it's their
best shot and they're going to say he
got everything right and everything's
going
well so do not
assume that Trump becomes president or
vake or anybody
else if everything looks like it's going
well according to the news and that's
where we're heading and by the way I
think actually 2024 will be a good year
do you know
why it's just time it's simply time for
a good year because we do have a cyclic
economy and always have it always goes
up and down and it's never going to go
straight up it's never going to I hope
never going to go straight down to
nothing it's just going to always be
this bumpy ride that we hope goes up on
average so we've been you know we got we
got our teeth kicked in with the
pandemic and so it was just sort of time
given the the Natural Energy of
Economics on the country it was time we
we we were going to pull out of it and
here we are pulling out of it we
reinvent we fix we tweak we
adjust and I'll say it
again um and this is
totally uh this is obnoxious sounding if
you're not an American so I'm going to
apologize to all the non-americans
listening because you could probably say
the same thing about your own country
but I'm going to speak just a sort of a
proud American for a moment we are
really good at fixing
 really really good at it like if
everything goes wrong we we step
up and so I think 2024 is going to look
like a correcting
year in a lot of ways economically
militarily maybe a lot of
ways climate Wise information wise free
speechwise going to be a lot of change I
I think that America has uh done what it
always does which is a found a way we're
just really good at finding a way so I
think that'll keep
happening all right
um here's a free few things you should
know about the publication called the
Atlantic now you know the Steve Jobs
Widow took that Apple money and bought
the Atlantic and turned it into a uh
largely it's I'd say it's
a m let's say it's power in the world is
political so the political stories tend
to be the ones you talk about from it
and it's a Democrat
Centric but you've seen a bunch of
stories from the Atlantic right you know
you read social media and they'll be oh
the the Atlantic says this about Trump
and the Atlantic says that about Trump
and the Atlantic says this about magga
and they're always doing you know hit
job on either some friendly Republican
or Trump or something so it's the H jobs
here's here's some background you should
know about the
Atlantic uh their entire
readership is about uh 80% as large as
the audience for any one of my posts on
X so I have a million followers on the
xplatform and The Atlantics entire
readership is a little over
800,000 so just so you know its size is
a little bit smaller than than my
account on
X just just so you know the size okay
now they have course are left leading
and so the first thing I'm going to
check what's the first thing I'm going
to check well I want to see a picture of
their staff know you because if there's
one thing I know about the
Atlantic uh they very much want to have
a diverse um staff and in fact they have
they do a report every every year they
do a report on their own efforts for
diversity so I looked at the report for
2023 their staff is 62%
white now I assume they're mostly white
supremacists because I've been told that
you put that many white people in one
place mostly white supremacists am I
right mostly so mostly the Atlantic is
uh way supremacist
and they're very proud of their hiring
so this year 72% of new hires were women
no I take that back 72% of new hires
this past year identified as women they
say that specifically identified as
women now if I were trying to get a job
as the Atlantic I'd probably identify as
a woman I wouldn't change what I wore
but if I knew that 72% of the new hires
were women i' don't think I would go in
there and lead with my penis here's what
I wouldn't do don't go into an interview
at the Atlantic unzip your pants slap
your piece on the desk and say I'm a man
and I'm here for a job that won't work
it's not going to work no no you need to
identify as a woman because 72% of their
new hires were
women now here's what I
think I think they need a lot more
diversity does anybody think they don't
have enough diversity CU what they
didn't say is what percentage of men
work there already 72% of the new hires
are women but what it seems like they
left out the most important thing which
is how many of the staff are or men
especially in Senior Management seems
like there's none of that so I found out
I found a new way to destroy all the
Publications that do hit pieces on me do
you know what it
is I'm going to
insist that they improve their
diversity until they're out of
business now let me be very clear why do
I say that increasing diversity will put
them out of business is it because I
think the diverse people would do a
worse job nope nope it is not because of
that it's not because of anything racial
it's not because of anything uh
gender-wise
is math if everybody is chasing the same
small pool of qualified people because
every big company wants to be diverse
the math suggests there won't be
enough what will they do will they hire
white people and make things
worse or will they hire lesser
qualified uh diverse folks so that they
can improve their diversity what do you
think they'll
do well I think they're quite committed
to diversity more so than uh competence
and capability now I'm sure they like
both of those things they want
competence and capability they want
diversity but if you're in a hurry you
can't have
both if you're willing to take your time
well you got a good shot at it because
then you don't have to rush and hire
people that maybe you would to hired
under normal circumstances you take your
time make sure if you got a black
candidate really qualified good female
cand Cate really qualified good good job
and then eventually maybe you could
reach some kind of situation that looks
like the country and I'm in favor of
that by the way I say this all the time
I don't know if you really believe it
but it's true I do think companies are
better off all things being equal if you
can get the same level of capability if
the company roughly resembles the
public that's a good thing as long as
you're not giving something up
to get that if you have to give
something up then it's a different story
and the problem is just the pool of
candidates it's has nothing to do with
anything racial has nothing to do with
anything gender it's just math so that's
how I'm going to put my Critics on a
business in 2024 I'm just going to
highlight their lack of diversity and
insist that they fix it and here's the
important part really
quickly do it quickly I'd like to see
this taken care of by the end of the
year and you'll be on a business in two
years
but I like the plan for the long
run all right uh Tucker is saying out
loud the thing that uh is so
scary uh that Trump might be
assassinated and let let me give you his
reasoning which is I hate to say
it Rock
Solid but it is all right here's in
Tucker's words quote I mean just charted
out and the case of trump they started
with protests they moved to impeachment
now they're at indictment none of it has
worked what's next what could possibly
be next if you felt and you really
believed and a lot of them do that the
worst thing that could happen to the
country and more specifically to you in
the professional class is to have Donald
Trump as
president and they've been accelerating
and what's left in their
quiver
and he said and I think you should be
prepared at least psychologically for
them to do
anything and I don't think I've ever
agreed with Tucker this
much you need to be mentally prepared
that they could take him
out you really
do now I don't want to talk it into
existence because I think talking about
it makes it more likely so I feel very
uncomfortable talking about it but it is
now moved from you know something that
you know trolls will talk about do
something that seems like the most
likely
case so unless the news can destroy him
before election day and they'll try
pretty
hard what else they going to
do now the trouble
is if you picked a strong enough vice
president they wouldn't be able to kill
him do you
agree do you know what V
is V is assassination insurance for
Trump I've said this before but let me
say it
again if they take out
Trump we're going to shove vake down
their
throats and he's going to disembowel
them and they don't want to do
that you you think Trump's a risk you
have no idea Trump is not nearly the
risk that aake is in a good way VI would
be good for the country not bad
but ju just imagine your point of view
all right uh put yourself in this
situation just mentally let's say
something terrible happens that takes
Trump out of the race it doesn't have to
be assassination just something that you
recognize as a dirty trick something you
recognize is unfair and they take your
candidate out if your candidate was
Trump let's say they take him out on the
last hour before the
election not the last hour but you know
uh long enough that the Republicans
would have to scramble so let's say the
Republicans
scramble and they put in another
candidate let's say it's
aake are they going to be happy about
that
see if aake is not in the race at all by
that point it wouldn't make sense to put
him
in but in the unlikely event the V said
he would uh accept a VP running mate
position in the unlikely event because
he's running for president I like to say
that out of respect out of respect for
vake in the job that he's doing he's
running for president right he's not
running for second place and I think he
has a legitimate chance the first place
cuz a lot can happen in the next year so
but in this situation that he had Trump
had a strong vice president doesn't have
to be vake he's just the he would be the
scariest to the other side the scariest
because he's the most capable not scary
because he's a dangerous person he' be
the scariest because he's the most
capable of getting what what he says he
wants to
do and a great Persuader yes
um so so here's the thing the thing that
protects Trump is a backup plan that's
the same or better so here's what you
need to do if you're trying to persuade
yourself into a winning position and you
know I think Trump definitely listens to
the
bass so if the Bas
says this time Donald Trump you can't
pick a weak a weaker vice president
depend was a weak vice president
compared to Trump we'd all agree with
that right I liked I like Pence as a
vice president but he's weak and it's
tradition that the president the
candidate for president picks a weaker
vice president so that you don't spend
your entire time saying oh maybe it
should be the other way around turn it
upside down right but this one
time Trump needs to save his life and
protect um the country at the the same
time by making sure that his vice
president looks like the destroyer of
worlds yeah you want the vice president
to look like the destroyer of worlds
from a Democrat perspective not not
somebody who would actually do any
damage but somebody who would scare them
more or at least as much as
Trump and that could be done that could
definitely be done all
right
uh NBC News posted today on X said a
news study outlines how white people's
migration during and after the Civil War
bolstered white supremacy and
institutional racism in non-slave States
contributing to the vast racial
disparities that exist today
Nationwide my commentary on that story
is uh you and you and you
sabore because I don't care about
ancient history if the only reason
you're going to bring it up is to call
me a white supremacist and make me feel
guilty about you NBC you
NBC your eyes your head
your stupid
brains right I'm not even going to talk
about this story I don't care if it's
true I wasn't alive so them and
 their racist divisive if
you've got an idea for improving things
NPC I'm all ears got an idea for
improving things or you just want us to
be mad at each other with your
stories you all
right speaking of uh the media ABC this
week had uh three women on who uh worked
for president Trump in the White House
the first term and uh Jonathan Carl
there was to discuss discuss their
experiences and uh they said bad things
and if Trump's reelected it's the end of
the world now why do you think it had to
be three
women was it a complete coincidence that
the only people they could get from
Trump's prior Administration happened to
be female and they were the ones who
were available and willing to talk about
it do you think that's it do you do you
think that they were the three that were
available and willing to say this stuff
nobody else just these three but why did
ABC decide to have to be three
women clearly they're talking to the
Democrat base and they're saying look
even the Republican women are on your
side don't you get it women Trump is bad
the women can see it it's only the men
who have been brainwashed but the women
can clearly see yeah so it's uh crazy
 two
words
um let's talk about uh the Saudis and
Israel I saw a article in American
Thinker by John
Levin and just a large article I posted
it re reposted it so you can see it um
but his point is that Saudi Arabia and
Israel
probably um need to be good
friends because they both want to I mean
the direction was that way and this
business with the MOs Iran seems to be
to try to drive a
wedge between
um uh between Israel and Saudi Arabia
but it doesn't look like that wedge
worked because they seem to both be
willing to keep going once this ugliness
has passed uh but John Lin's point is
that uh well let me read
it he says uh for Saudi Arabia
normalization with Israel and midwifing
Israeli palestin Ian
reconcilation would accelerate its own
integration into the modern order while
dislodging its greatest Rivals Outpost
his rival being
Iran the Sunni Saudis and the Shiite
Ayatollah in Iran are champ champions of
competing Islamic
factions uh that they've been Waging War
against ether so the basic idea is that
Saudi
Arabia uh if it allowed Iran to get its
way and to to let's say minimize or
destroy Israel that it would be a small
matter of time before Saudi Arabia was a
little bit
surrounded so it would be an
enormous benefit for Iran if the Israeli
influence disappeared and apparently it
would be an enormous benefit to Saudi
Arabia to be economically at least tied
to Israel and so I've been saying for
months since October 7th that the most
uh
logical
solver for what looks like a permanent
problem between the Palestinians and
Israel would be a Saudi administration
of the uh some kind of administration of
the areas that are Palestinian
majority so I don't see any way around
it at this point I feel like you know
maybe Israel's plan is that Israel just
forever controls the West Bank in Gaza
but I feel like that would just make
Iran
matter whereas if you went the other
direction and you pushed Saudi and
Israel closer together even if it's only
on paper it's going to look like it
didn't work so you want Iran to think
that trying to drive Saudi and Israel
apart will cause them to be closer
together and one way to do that would be
to say to Saudi Arabia you know what
would make you go from the country that
we suspect because 9911 had some Saudi
ties and we're not so sure about our
past with Saudi Arabia we don't know
about that bone saw situation right but
you don't think Saudi wants to get out
of that and into the the top of the
stage you know a credible major
superpower I think they do and the way
to get there is on the same side with
the United States and at least
economically with
Israel and that seems to be the
direction we're going so I would say
that what's going to come out of this is
Saudi taking a bigger role to try to put
some order in the West Bank now I don't
know what they can do given that you've
got some um Sunni and Shiite problems
there uh I don't know how much the
Palestinians would want it the Saudi
involvement but at least it wouldn't be
Israel so my prediction is that Saudi
Arabia will be a productive partner and
they'll get closer to Israel as a
result um there was some news just
before I came on that maybe there's some
an update on this I guess the Iranian
National Guard or no the
irgc that's the
Iranian what are those
initials the irgc is that the normal
Army of Iran or is that their special
forces of some
kind wait Palestinians are
Sunni wait a minute wait a minute are
the Palestinians
Sunni somebody said in the
comments and Gaza too is Gaza all
Sunni
really so why am I fighting
this I was making an assumption I was
making an assumption that Iran would
only be helping
Shiites so you tell me that Iran has
been funding
sunnis I'll be
damn I'll be
damn and a lot of you knew that well
don't I feel
dumb H you if I ever told you that uh
one of my superpowers I think I tell you
this all the time one of my superpowers
is complete freedom from
embarrassment I just don't get
embarrassed I used to but I just learn
not to so imagine having a show in which
you talk about politics and you talk
about the Middle East and you're finding
out in real time in front of a live
audience that your most basic assumption
about the region was
wrong that's what I'm experiencing right
now but am I unhappy no I'm kind of
happy about it because I just found out
like a very useful fact because the
thing that I was worried about was that
Saudi Arabia wouldn't be credible as a
Helper but if you're telling me that
they're all
sunnis well then suddenly that does make
look looks like it would
work I would rather be uh dumb in
public like I am now than not have the
situation resolved so to me this is an
upgrade all right cool thank you
um but anyway the uh irgc whatever
military force of Iran that is has
reportedly issued orders and they're
withdrawing from their positions in
Syria near the Iraq border maybe not all
of their positions in Syria but the ones
near the Iraq border so they're
evacuating all their
bases and it you know coincides with the
intensification of uh military action
over there so what do you think is
happening this is something I would
expect to see if Trump were
president you know why it looks like it
looks like Biden just said uh you better
leave because we're going to kill all of
you why else would they
leave you know we've been wondering why
Biden has been uh going
soft on some of the proxies the Iranian
proxies you know people were complaining
oh yeah he gives them a little beast
thing once in a while but you know why
doesn't it get tough we say the same
thing about
Yemen I feel like the Biden
Administration just told Iran what
they're going to
do meaning hey Iran you're going to
withdraw your forces from this
area what we're not going to withdraw
our forces from this area yeah you
actually are you're going to withdraw
all your forces from this area no we're
not well okay you have a choice we are
going to to withdraw all your forces
from that area but they're going to be
in
bags so they can walk out or they could
leave in bags but now that's your only
choices so do what you need to do and by
the way if they don't leave we're going
to pave IR going to pave Yemen or
something yeah we're going to take out
all of your proxies all of
them would Iran uh would Iran believe
that was a
fair uh
um Fair
threat I don't know it looks good to
me it looks like a good threat to me
because I do think that our
military-industrial
complex would be itching to take out the
proxies and if they want to do it they
could probably get their
way yeah here's what I would love to
know wouldn't you love to know who has
made what
threats to whom lately in the Middle
East all about the real story is the
threats that the credible threats that
people have made to each other at the
government level that we don't exactly
know
about because here's the thing if if
America said to Iran you know what the
proxy thing doesn't work anymore for us
and we're going to get rid of
them and that's that's the decision
there's not going to be any proxies in
this area anymore so we're just going to
get rid of them if you'd like we'll give
you time to withdraw but they're not
going to be there when we're done we're
going to get rid of all of them that
feels like that conversation happened
doesn't it now it could be that I'm
wrong about everything and they're
withdrawing the forces to you know maybe
reinforce somewhere else so it could be
completely a fake
out anyway all right um
here's a uh 2023 uh afterthought just
for me
personally I realized you know I was
thinking back of the people who
cancelled me in
2023 now of course there are corporate
entities that I don't care too much
about didn't make that much difference
in my life but there were also
individuals there there were actually
specific individuals that cancelled me
and and told me in person and here's
what I I realized about the ones who
canceled
me um three of the people who canceled
me in person you know not economically
professionally are people that I had
mentored or helped professionally and
asked nothing in
return now I'm just going to put that
out
there there are three people who were in
my life in a fairly substantial way
meaning that I had helped them
professionally in a not not not a
trivial way all three of
them and all three of them decided to
cancel me without asking the context
without ever like digging into like what
was the point of it or what I really
thought is that
amazing
yeah
yep
um so there's
that let me let me give you some advice
about
giving this would be the most important
thing you ever heard if you decide to do
a kindness to somebody without asking
anything in return it usually won't work
out did you know
that doing things for other people
almost never works out it's like a 80%
failure rate you like lending somebody
money you know doing them a big
favor uh helping them get a job job ever
help somebody get a job about 80% it
doesn't
work so that's the first thing you need
to know here's the second part do it
anyway do it anyway the do it anyway is
the important part 80% of the time it's
not going to work and really you're
going to wish you hadn't do it
anyway just do it
anyway because that's the world you want
to live in and it's about you
so the so the best advice you'll ever
get is make your actions about you
you're allowed you can be who you are so
you can make yourself the person you
want to be how people react to you well
that's a separate question but you can
be the person who will help doesn't have
to work it's about who you are now you
can say to me but Scott I'm being wise
and knowledgeable and I'm not going to
help because 80% of the time it
backfires and and hits me in the face to
which I say but it worked 20% of the
time 20% of time it worked do it
anyway do it
anyway that's all just because that's
who you want to be and it's also the
world you want to live in you want to
live in the world where somebody says
80% failure rate I'll do it
anyway yeah so that is your message for
2024 and I think it's going to be a good
year um if you didn't see breit Bart by
uh Joel Pollock did a nice article um
quoting some of my optimism for 2024
which I will repeat I think the economy
is going to do relatively well I think
our Wars will wind down and I think our
manufacturing is moving back from uh
China I think uh we will have a new
president I think immigration will have
to be solved I think crime the cities
will have to be solved and I think
you'll see movement on all of it so I
feel like things are heading in the
right direction and freedom of speech at
least on the xplatform seems to be fully
fully operating so we're going to have
robots we're going to have ai we're
going to have a good economy we're going
to have fewer Wars we're going to move
our manufacturing back and I think that
wokeness and ESG and Dei are now at
least things we can talk about honestly
which will get us to a good place in my
opinion what went wrong with ESG and Dei
is that white men were afraid to talk
that's it there just wasn't uh you
didn't have a balance of opinions to get
where we are you had bullies and you had
people who were just hiding in their
Foxhole until it all blew over but that
didn't
work yeah 80% of the time 80% of the
time giving people what they ask for or
doesn't work and that that's certainly
true with the Dei and ESG stuff now it
might be that we'll be we'll all be
better off for the fact that those
existed meaning that our awareness is
higher you know maybe maybe we'll try a
little harder to make places look
diverse but without giving up uh too
much in in
return all right um and ladies and
gentlemen
that's all I've got for you today thanks
for joining on YouTube you've been
amazing all year and
uh this coming year even better
