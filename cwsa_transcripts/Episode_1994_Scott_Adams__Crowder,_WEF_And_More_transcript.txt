foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization coffee
with Scott Adams there's never been a
finer thing and if you'd like to take
this up to levels that nobody's ever
experienced before unless they've
climbed a mountain well doing acid
and having sex at the same time or
something like that but all we have
today is a substitute for all that good
stuff and it's called
a glass of Tankard shallow Stein a
canteen jug of flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it's happening now go
yeah that was a good one
looks like everything's uh operating
just the way it should today I'm feeling
like you're all going to have a good day
today
is anybody ready for a good day
yeah
uh Don M asked me what about smoking
weed with Scott Adams
well sounds like somebody needs to join
the locals community
where we do visit the man cave
in the evenings
and the man cave is a very different
very different situation
but we're going to go private over here
on locals
there are subscription sites they get
the good stuff
there you go you're private now
all right
what's going on uh question number one
I saw a user on Twitter Terry Schilling
asked this question to his users
should men still open doors for women
interesting question
should men still open doors now let me
make a distinction
uh the distinction is oh I'm only
private on the locals platform
so I do some extra content there on uh
on YouTube it's public this is all
public on YouTube
um
so I make a distinction between opening
a door
where a woman walks up to a door and
stands there and waits for you to open
the door for him
versus you've walked through a door and
then you're holding it open for somebody
or
you just get there first
because you're walking first and then
you hold it open for could it be a woman
but it could be anybody
now yeah
but now my take on this is if I don't
know their pronouns I don't want to take
a chance
and if you can't identify a Woman by
looking at them and I believe that is
the standard the standard now is that
you can't identify a woman just by
looking that would be kind of an
assumption
now what if you what if you saw somebody
coming
and you said to yourself oh
a woman I think I'll I'll be polite and
then what if you're wrong
what if it's somebody who identifies as
a man but you've misidentified well
what a problem
social problem for you
probably get canceled on social media as
well so don't take the chance
if you see a woman coming
or somebody you identify as a woman but
you don't know
hold that door closed and and don't let
that person even get through
that's the only way to play it you gotta
let him fight with it a little bit and
then you'll you'll all be like equal no
not even equal
Equitable that would be equitable
well that's just a big cluster F so
we'll see how that works out
um here's a growing positive trend
that you wouldn't notice unless you're
following certain Twitter accounts but
uh Corey DeAngelis continues to report
that you know various state legislatures
are improving uh funding for that
follows the kid instead of the school
so that uh parents could say let's take
our kid to another school and then some
money would go with them to help pay for
that alternate School
so free market
it's apparently Florida Florida
legislatures just introduced a bill to
fund students and study systems so a
number of states are doing it and the
conservative States seem to be passing
them
it's a big thing it's a big deal and
I love the fact
that when we talk about the states being
the laboratory for the country this is
exactly what we're talking about right
let a few smart States try something
they probably won't execute the same way
see if anybody can nail it if anybody
Nails it
maybe we know in you know five to seven
years and then we can start copying it
it's pretty good that's a pretty good
sign
actor Alec Baldwin is going to be
prosecuted for two counts
we've talked about this way too much but
um here's the first thing I'll bet we're
going to find out a whole bunch of
surprises
I think the trial will kick up some
things that just seem like surprises
and apparently uh
at one point early in the process
Baldwin had said in an interview
that he did not pull the the trigger but
the forensic people said yes the trigger
was pulled
now is that going to be a problem
because he said I would never point
a gun at a person and pull the trigger
even if it was a movie gun he said he
would never do that which suggests
unfortunately for him it suggests that
he was fully aware
fully aware of the danger of pointing a
gun into somebody
and he did pull the trigger according to
the forensics people we don't know
yeah I suppose it could be like a weird
defective gun that pulls its own Trigger
or something yeah the trigger pulled
itself
well
so here's my take on it I hate
you know the the legal system has to do
with the legal system does but
I hate
that it was a genuine accident
and some you know another life and his
family will all be scarred by it forever
I don't know it just doesn't feel like
justice because you can't bring the
person back
and it would be hard to punish him more
than he's already already punished you
know psychologically and financially and
reputationally and everything else
and it's not exactly like there's any
message to be sent is there
is there anybody in Hollywood who
doesn't already know to maybe double
check that gun like nobody's going to
learn anything if he goes to jail
there's no learning that will happen
so an histology is going to be like
reformed so if he makes another movie he
won't make that same mistake again
there's just nothing there's just no
benefit
now if you say that the family of the
deceased
should sue him and get a bunch of money
I think that already happened didn't it
and that that feels like the right
domain you know maybe there's financial
compensation
but I don't know jail doesn't make sense
now
let me make a completely different
switch my argument
yeah your head's going to spin here he
was also the head of the production
as the head of the Productions it looks
like you really effed up it looks like
he he just didn't do
you know the job of a boss to make sure
the right people who were in place in
the right processes that's that's harder
to defend
right the asking a non-gun owner actor
and the you know in the context of
fictional movie to do all the right
things yeah so that's a big ask
by asking a boss to make sure he hired
the right people to take care of safety
when there were all kinds of safety
complaints
that one's hard to defend
so I think he's in trouble but we're
gonna have some surprises
I know we'll have some surprises
apparently there were more uh live
bullets in his gun belt I saw that in a
Tim cast tweet all right
um
apparently we know why the airline
failure happened the FAA said some
contractor unintentionally
deleted some files
that some Antiquated system needed to
operate and it was hard to recover the
files
now
the obvious is why do we have a system
that's that week
that's like the weakest system I've ever
seen apparently it's really old it's
like from the generation of the Walkman
I saw somebody in Wall Street Journal
say
so
boy somebody was somebody who was not
doing their job there but there's not
much to say about that
I saw a video at the world economic
forum
in which FBI director Christopher Ray
was talking
and uh user Alx on Twitter tweeted this
is what Ray actually said
now it's a little out of context
but my point will be that he shouldn't
be there
in any capacity so even in context it's
all wrong but this is probably a little
bit out of context but here's what he
says
the level of collaboration between the
private sector and the government
especially the FBI has made significant
strides
yes it has
yes as a matter of fact it has
the scariest thing you've ever heard
why are we sending a representative of
the United States
to embarrass us in front of the world
what like why is that okay
like why does he still have a job
like everything about that is just
creepy and wrong
it was probably out of context and you
know I'm sure the context would have you
know not not sounded as scary so this is
something the Wes does is they do things
which
certainly sounds scary
you know who knows what they actually
intend to do
so
here's what I'm trying to understand
about the world economic forum
is it
a useless Dilbert entity where a bunch
of people get together and say a bunch
of jargon and have a nice holiday and go
home
how many people think that's what's
happening and that they don't really
have any impact on anything like
everything would have happened on its
own they just talk about it and take
credit and Pat each other in the back
oh I'm saying yeses and those but
I think it's at least partly that
wouldn't you agree
not no matter what else it is it's
partly just a bunch of
jargon spewing
you know
woke signaling people having a nice
vacation
it would be easy to overestimate how
much power they have but it would be
easy to underestimate it too because
there might be some circles you know
some areas where they do influence now I
saw on Dr Carlson's show the claim
that the wef was behind
Sri Lanka's uh destroyed economy
because Sri Lanka didn't use proper
fertilizer
because it was sort of you know
pooh-pooed by the wef in some way
is that true
let me say that without even looking
into it it doesn't sound true
doesn't sound true
yeah
so let me let me say that
uh I'll go look that oh let me do a
little research I was going to do that
before I get on but I want to comment it
before I research
before researching it it doesn't sound
true
it sounds like it's true-ish
it has the ring to it of something
that's sounds true but if you looked
into it there'd be a little something
there
well let me understand this the WF
cannot require anybody to do anything or
am I right
so they didn't require anybody to do
anything
and so Sri Lanka was under no more or
less requirement than every other
country is that is that true or false
every country had the same set of
standards that were being pushed on them
but one of them made a horrible
catastrophic decision
to I don't know follow some
some specific part of it too far
why did nobody else do it
incentives did the WF offer them
incentives
all right
heavily encouraged
did they heavily encourage them to look
for substitutes or did they heavily
encourage them to farm in a way that
would
not possibly work
because I have trouble believing that
the WF said get rid of your fertilizer
and don't replace it with anything
I don't believe that happened
do you believe that happened
I don't believe that happened and only
one country in all the countries only
only little Sri Lanka actually took that
advice
they're the only ones
all right now
um
am I am I acting too confident for
someone who has no information on the
topic whatsoever
probably
and probably
but but I but I want you to see
um so this is like a little test
is a little test I believe that you
could usually let's say eighty percent
of the time identify without
doing any research eighty percent of the
time now the twenty percent of the Iran
could be a real problem right so I'm not
I'm not saying 80 is good
but I think about 80 of the time you can
tell it's just
from the story itself
so I'm gonna I'm gonna call on
the story
with
a complete lack of knowledge about the
context
because I think I have an 80 chance of
being right
and then a 20 chance of embarrassing
myself but I never care about that right
so it's just an experiment I don't know
what's true I'll just I'll just make it
eighty percent bet then tomorrow if I
remember
we'll check and I'll tell you if there's
any context that changes the situation
but I don't believe it's true
uh but I could brawl
let's talk about uh Stephen Crowder
versus The Daily wire
I knew this story was going to get more
interesting
didn't you
couldn't you kind of smell it
like like there was a little story I'll
tell I'll give you the starting point
but just from the very beginning I
thought this is going to go deeper and
then it did
all right so the story is uh internet uh
say conservative Superstar
uh Stephen Crowder who has millions of
followers on YouTube and other places
and he was offered a very lucrative
contract to work with daily wire
and
what went wrong was the daily wire made
a large offer of 50 million over four
years with the option to extend
now that 50 million would include his
production costs but you know maybe
that's 10 or 20 percent of it
so it's a big deal
a connection problem there and Stephen
Crowder went in public but he didn't
name the entity he didn't name daily
wire initially
daily wire outed themselves because I
think they assumed people would figure
out who they were there are not many
entities on the right who could offer a
big contract right and he was leaving
Blaze the blaze so they're basically
were like
two entities they could offer him a lot
of money
and the daily wire was one
so people would have figured it out you
know I I think that trying to imagine
uh yeah I think that trying to imagine
that nobody would figure it out was
unrealistic in my opinion somebody would
have figured it out from the ends
but
uh Crowder said that the real issue was
that the daily wires offer was in let's
see if I can I'll try to do my most
honest attempt to accurately
characterize his his opinion which is
always sketchy whenever you're trying to
summarize someone else's opinion you
almost never get it right because I
watch people do it with me and they
never get it right
so I'm I'm wary that I might be
misrepresenting his opinion but you you
all many of you have seen it so keep me
honest okay so call me out if I'm not
representing his side as accurately as
possible
part of the deal said that if uh Crowder
got demonetized by YouTube for example
or some other platforms that would have
a obviously have a big impact on their
shared Revenue so the idea was Crowder
would make content daily wire would
promote it and put it on their platforms
Etc
and then the two of them would share the
combined money
but if Crowder did something that would
get him uh demonetized or banned on
platforms the amount of money the two of
them could make could be substantially
decreased
so so the daily wires first offer and
first offer is important first offer is
not a final offer his first offer was
that there would be a financial offsets
for that or penalties you might call it
so that they wouldn't have to pay
Crowder
millions of dollars if he was making no
money for them
now
Crowder interpreted this as
effectively a form of censorship because
he would be penalized
if some other platform that he can't
control
decided he said something they didn't
like
so in effect his point which is accurate
this is an accurate point is that the
daily wires offer would make him still
subsidiary to the social media sensors
in other words he he would now the daily
wire
would be an extra force on the side of
the the sensors
does that capture it that the daily
wires offer because it included a
penalty for bad behavior you know bad
behavior and quotes that that was the
same as being on the side of the sensors
how many would take that view oh and
furthermore furthermore he said very
clearly it is not about the money
it is not about the money
does that capture it
and then he backed up is not about the
money
by saying I never said the 50 million
wasn't enough I never even discussed the
dollar amount
which appear apparently is true
so does that
does that back his view that it's not
about the money
because he never discussed the 50
million it's only about them being on
the side of the sensors and that he was
he was also concerned not so much for
himself but he said directly on an audio
we heard he said but what about the the
smaller person who comes up and can't
negotiate with you what about them are
they going to get this deal too where
basically everybody's just going to be
under the heel of the sensors which is
exactly what we don't want and then he
suggested that they move away
from being dependent on Advertising
now so would you characterize that as
number one not about the money
how many would you agree
the Crowder's complaint was not about
the money
you're not quite sure are you well I'm
gonna I'm gonna clear it up for you in a
minute all right and
um
all right so let me give you three
different takes on this
the first take will be people who don't
have experience in business
second take will be from a lawyer
the third take will be from somebody
who's very experienced at negotiating
contracts very much of this type
all right do you think those three views
are going to be the same
not even close
not even close all right so for our
first uh stand in for the opinion of
someone who I believe
and if by the way if I'm
mischaracterizing this individual please
correct me
but uh do you know uh Carolyn borisenko
on Twitter uh Dr Carolyn besenko now
she's a popular Tweeter you've seen a
lot of her tweets probably and
her take was uh oh first of all you need
to know that Stephen Crowder recorded
his phone call with the daily wire
and then he played it on the air
okay we'll talk about that
but Dr uh borisenko says Stephen Crowder
recorded phone call with the daily wire
CEO that absolutely destroys the
narrative that they meaning the daily
wire have been trying to sell you
and so I listened to the audio
and I didn't hear that
I didn't hear anything like that I
didn't hear any narrative get destroyed
do you know what I heard
I'll tell you in a minute
so
so somebody who and again if I'm
mischaracterizing this
you know somebody should correct me
because I'll apologize but I don't think
that Dr borisenko would characterize
herself
as an expert in business or negotiating
I don't think so now if you're not if
you're not really experienced in
negotiating
would it be reasonable that your take on
this is incomplete
that there's maybe some blind spots
because just a lack of experience in
this it's a very unique domain right
it's a domain that if you're not
quite uh like experienced with there'd
be huge things that are not obvious to
you it would just be obvious to somebody
who does it for a living
so that's one take so I'll uh I'll say
more about that but the initially I
would say uh it looks like she's
agreeing that it wasn't about the money
and it looks like she's agreeing that it
was about the censorship
is that a reasonable take for somebody
who's not an expert at negotiating
contracts
is that reasonable from that perspective
let's say
I think so
I I mean it sounds like a smart person
because she is smart
she's you know she's above average way
above average I think way above average
in IQ and accomplishment
and it's reasonable you know if if that
was your frame of reference
now let's take another frame of
reference
uh there's a an attorney maybe you've
heard of them Robert Barnes has anybody
ever heard of attorney Robert Barnes
well he's got to take
um in which he said on Twitter Crowder
called the Crowder called the Gilded
cage of censored speech slavery to Big
Tech
uh not the dollar offer and he says
Crowder was right
so from a lawyer's take
um
he's sort of more of like a technical
take on what he said
and his technical take is that it was
about sensory speech you know slavery
the big Tech it was not about the dollar
amount of the offer
so that's the lawyers take
by contacts Robert Barnes is who I call
the dumbest attorney in the world
but that doesn't mean he's wrong on this
just on he's wrong about me but so I I
just have a problem with him personally
but
yeah yeah is that a reasonable opinion
do you think that the attorney view
because it very much agrees with
um
Carolyn Dr basenko
pretty reasonable yeah I'm going to say
that's reasonable based on what he heard
all right now I'm going to give you the
third view which is someone with
extensive business experience in this
exact domain
and that would be me
because not only am I a content provider
who has done lots of content providing
contracts of all kinds
but I also used to be a contract
negotiator for a living
and you know I've got a degree in
economics and the MBA and so I have
exactly the qualifications for exactly
this topic all right so would somebody
who has lots of experience in it
have the same view as the attorney
and
as Dr basenko well here's my take
it's always about the money
it's always about the money
here's why
now in order to understand that you
would have to have some experience
so the the idea was that Crowder would
lose money if he got demonetized on the
platform
but the daily wire quite reasonably
quite reasonably the daily wire said
well if you make less money
shouldn't we pay you less money
is that unreasonable
he says that if you pay me less money in
censorship no it isn't it's less money
if he didn't care about the money he
wouldn't be complaining about the
contract
because the contract allows them to say
anything he wants wherever he wants
what would be the penalty
just money the reason he he feels he's
trapped in the Gilded cage is that he'll
lose money
if he says what he wants to say and is
judged uh unfit for the platforms
so he doesn't want to be under the the
Yoke of advertisers
we agree with that he should not be
under the Yoke of advertisers but what
should he have done
how should he have handled it if he were
an experienced business person
operating with full ethics number one
you never record somebody's phone call
in a negotiation and play it in public
if you do no one should ever work with
you again
no there's no forgiveness there's no
second strike
there's no second chance for that one
right that that is game
oh it's so hard not to swear
that is game over
from an Ethics perspective unless you
know if we find out later let me let me
soften this a little because there might
be something I don't know
so you know if in 48 hours we find out
that the daily wire knew they were
recorded and agreed to it and agreed to
have it public
that'd be fine
but that's not an Evidence at the moment
it looks like he recorded them without
their knowledge and played it without
their knowledge if that's true the daily
wire should not be working with him he
that would be evidence that he's not not
a person you could trust that would be
one of the worst things I've ever seen
in a business context
right no he didn't steal any money
but it's as bad as a you know Gary as a
Madoff
FTX Sam bagman free I mean except for
the money amount because it wasn't no
money was lost but in terms of
uh
ethical breaches it's as big as it gets
I mean it's literally illegal depending
where you are right I think it depends
on the state or something but it's
literally illegal to record somebody
with audio without their permission in
my state it is it's different I think
different places
so that's the first thing you need to
know so the daily wire uh has played
this so far
professionally and I got I got to give
them credit for that now here's what
Crowders should have done or could have
done if he had more experience
and wanted to solve this
he could have said to them look I
totally understand
that if we have a deal where we're both
doing something to make money and if I
do something that makes you not have
money that that needs to be dealt with
somehow because otherwise why would the
daily wire make a deal when they didn't
you know without protecting the thing
that's their biggest risk
here's how they do it it's a very
typical contract problem
Stephen Crowder could uh counter with
this how about
we share the subscription Revenue
and I just keep the all of the YouTube
revenue and then it's my problem if they
you know I'll say whatever I want and
it's just my problem if they demonetize
me but we'll have a much smaller dollar
amount and we'll just share the
subscription money so that the daily
wire will never ever be in a position
where even accidentally they're on the
side of the sensors
because that's where the subscription
gets you people just pay it no matter
what
that would be the counteroffer I've made
those counter offers before it's very
standard business now you might say but
why did the daily wire offer that in the
first place
to which I say that's not the way it
works no they make the offer that's good
for them the daily wire
and they make it close enough to
something that's good for the other
person that when they negotiate you know
they're not too far off and you could go
back and forth so Crowder could have
easily said how about way less money
but I'll have full control to say what I
want and if I get demonetized it only
affects me
now they might not have gone for that
offer
but that's the offer
but in every case it's only about the
money
it's only about the money
because the money is what causes the
censorship
so to say it's about the censorship is
honestly that seems disingenuous like I
I don't even know what to think about
that
Jared says wow Scott you completely Miss
Stefan's point
um I bet I don't
his point is that the daily wire would
be
colluding in this in the sentence
accidentally but colluding with the big
tech companies to censor him isn't that
the point
um
right do you I'm just saying it did I
really miss the point I don't think I
did
I think you missed the first part where
I described his point in detail
so
um
how do I do a deal like this
same way
same way
so when I do a deal with a publisher
do you think the publisher says I'll
give you millions of dollars no matter
what you do
of course not
do they say we will give you a contract
if you give us a book we can't publish
because it's so terrible
no in every case people have to perform
performing to a contract is the most
basic thing any contract does so they
just said this is what we expect of you
if this thing happens to you it's going
to happen to us at the same time you
know we're both not going to get that
YouTube money so let's share the risk if
he wanted them to take more of the risk
he could have done it you could have
just offered
something else
all right
so it's always about the money because
the thing he's talking about can be
transferred into money every anytime
anybody says it's not about the money
stop listening to them everything they
say after it's not about the money when
there's 50 million dollars there it's
always about the money
always
you know the fact that he's talking
about it in the public what's that about
it's about the money
right
you know his nose
so I'm going to be strongly on the side
of the daily wire on this they made a
good first offer he didn't counter he
could have there are lots of ways to
counter he didn't
and he recorded them and I would never
even I would never even take his phone
call would you
if Stephen Crowder called you
would you even take his call
if you know he recorded somebody and
then played it I wouldn't even answer
the phone
I don't know how he could ever go
forward and do business with anybody at
this point I mean seriously that that is
an ethical lapse of just Monumental size
in my opinion maybe it's just a pet
peeve
all right here's something interesting
uh on Fox Business on Charlie Payne's
show making money
um this big master of Finance Jeffrey
gun ledge he's the double line CEO
so he's one of the you know Masters of
the Universe in finance and he he's he's
talked about fentanyl
and he says that the lack of action to
shut down Fentanyl
has to be intentional
you said that right on you said that
right on TV
he goes there's no explanation for the
lack of action it has to be intentional
this is this is I don't know if he's a
billionaire he's probably a billionaire
this is somebody who's High credibility
in the business World who's looked at
this and says there's no explanation it
has to be intentional that we're letting
a hundred thousand people die
for what reason we don't know but since
you know what the problem is and you
know what you would do if you were
trying to solve it and we're not doing
the things that you do if you're even
trying
like it would be one thing to try and
fail
but we're not trying
see that part is unexplained
failing everybody gets failing that's
just you know business as usual but not
trying
on one of the biggest problems in the
country that everyone realizes is the
best
that has to be corruption
it has to be it's the process of
elimination
if you could give me one other
explanation I would take it
but it's got to be corruption now it
might not be all money corruption it
might be somebody doesn't want to you
know raise their head and say something
that will get them you know fewer voters
or something but it's still corrupt
because they're not doing the people's
work it's just a different kind of
corruption
all right well it was good to know that
somebody smart and prominent has exactly
the same opinion the first thing I did
was go to his Twitter account and find
out if he was following me
because I haven't heard anybody else say
it have you
have you have you heard anybody else say
that the lack of action
process of elimination it's got to be
intentional
who has anybody else said that
no he doesn't follow he doesn't follow
me on Twitter
so so what's uh that's even more
impressive because it means I'm not the
only one noticing but it means that just
smart observers are saying the same
thing that there's no action and there's
no explanation for the direction do you
know what was the other
time I saw this when Obama reversed his
position when he said he wouldn't touch
the dispensaries and the weed business
in States and then he did exactly the
opposite and he said he would go after
the dispensaries
and he never said why he changed his
View
never said
to which I said if you don't explain why
you changed your opinion is corruption
is the Assumption it has to be
corruption so I assume that that
Obama's a criminal
based on that
yeah
just of that alone I I assume he's a
criminal
um there's a funny story about the
Supreme Court leaker remember with a
that Roe verse Wade thing that got
overturned and Jonathan Turley says that
they on Twitter the Supreme Court's
report uh indicates that they cannot
isolate the culprit
among the over 80 possible suspects so
that's people who had access to the
document and it is an admission that is
almost as chilling as the leak itself
uh 80 people
and then Joel Pollock writing in
Breitbart notes that
uh it appears that the Supreme Court did
not investigate the Supreme Court
Justices themselves
[Laughter]
no I don't know this for sure yeah
unless it was done in secret but there's
no mention no mention
that the Supreme justices themselves are
obvious suspects
now here's the funny part
well it's funny or tragic you decide so
the Supreme Court should be in our
system
the most credible entity we have because
it's sort of our final defense against
other entities being corrupt right so so
if if your Supreme Court isn't your best
people in terms of credibility and
honesty you've got a real problem
because that's like you know the cap of
the whole business right
so
here's what's hilarious
uh oh and also some of the people they
talked to admitted they talk to their
spouses
so some of the 80s said no I didn't leak
it to the media but I did tell my spouse
so we now have a situation
where we can't trust the justices
we can't trust at least 80 of their
staff
and I'm not sure we can trust their
spouses
so it turns out that the entity that we
should trust the most
has more suspects to this crime than any
group you can imagine
like if this happened in you know any
retail store that had lots of employees
I don't think they would have hundreds
of suspects do you
have you ever seen any crime
in which there were hundreds of suspects
of the same entity
when a bank when a bank gets robbed it's
an Insider job are there hundreds of
suspects
the the the the fact that everybody is a
suspect is to be as hilarious like just
everybody they're all they're all
untrustworthy
see that's why transparency is the the
only solution you really can't trust
anybody in government
you just have to have transparency it's
the only way
speaking of transparency
um
Rasmussen is reporting did a very
provocative poll
and uh reported that 57 percent of
likely U.S voters
believe Congress should investigate the
CDC
over their vaccine handling
uh but it gets even more interesting
41 don't think it's likely the CDC has
provided complete information
so 22 percent say it's not likely that
they got complete information so
unfortunately I fall into the 22 percent
because I famously always say 25 or so
get every poll wrong in other words they
they have the dumb answer for every poll
but here I am in the 22 percent
I'm in the group that says it's not
likely at all that the the CDC provided
complete information about vaccine risks
do you know why it's not likely they
provided complete information
yeah
because they're not psychic how could
they possibly have complete information
did the CDC know what was going to
happen in five years
you know when any potential problems
might arise no no all they knew is what
the
the manufacturers told them basically
so how in the world could they have that
information they can't tell you it's
safe they could just tell you what
somebody told them that's all they could
do
so anybody who thought that they should
know it's safe how would they possibly
know that that was unknowable
all right uh but then I guess more
interesting
Rasmussen asked people uh how many of
them know somebody they think died from
vaccines or had vaccine injury it's like
28 percent
what
28 percent
how about this
um 68 of the this is from racism also 68
of the 260 million adults
and that would be 177 million adults in
the United States so 177 million
indicate that receives the covid
vaccination and seven percent of those
reported major side effects
now that would translate to 12 million
people
with major side effects
I guess I would include well I I don't
know I guess that doesn't include death
because they couldn't have answered the
poll
but that got picked up in the the other
question
so how do you interpret this let's say
uh and by the way hold hold your
analysis for a moment
right because I've got some I'll go
deeper
so
suppose uh the I think the polling is
probably accurate in the sense that
seven percent really did answer that
they had in their in their opinion major
side effects
let's say you knew that was true we
don't know that's true but let's say you
know it was a fact the seven percent
reported major side effects that they
associate with the vaccination
would you say that is strong evidence
there's a problem
evidence of nothing
or strong evidence that the vaccinations
work
go
a strong evidence the vaccinations are
killing people
doesn't tell us anything
or it's strong evidence that the
vaccinations were a good idea on a risk
reward basis
what's your interpretation
a lot of people say nothing
interesting well remember you know it's
a poll of people's opinions
so you know by by definition that's not
a science but
wouldn't you be worried as the various
report had this how is it different than
the various report
is it less reliable than the Verge
report
which is where the doctor's input who
they think got injury
from the vaccinations
all right let me give you some context
so seven percent report that they
believe the vaccination injured it
doesn't mean they're right that's just
their best view of what it was
but in context eighty percent of the
United States believes angels are real
80 percent
60 percent believe in ghosts that go
surreal
60 percent
um six percent of Americans are not
don't believe it but they are sensitive
to gluten
six percent are sensitive to gluten
but 25 percent
self-diagnosed as sensitive to gluten
so only six percent are scientifically
sensitive to it but 25 believe they are
right
um
the placebo effect how big is the
placebo effect if you if you compare the
non-active pill to the real pill in a
study
the placebo effect is 30 to 60 percent
so 30 to 60 percent of people
will report that the pill helped them
Thirty to sixty percent
when it did nothing
or maybe it did because their body just
reacted to their belief
how about how many people believe Elvis
is alive
four percent four percent of the country
thinks Elvis is alive
what percent of the country think
Bigfoot is real
14 percent
um according to an NBC poll this was
taken some time ago how many believe
Hillary Clinton is honest
what percentage of the of the country
believes Hillary Clinton is honest 11 11
percent
all right
so 11 of the country thinks Hillary is
honest but only seven percent think they
were injured by vaccinations
I don't know does that context do
anything for you
so the context should be how accurate
are people's self-reporting
anything
yeah seven percent actually sounds low
to me
it says low
I would I would have expected more like
20 percent
but seven percent is probably exactly
the number of people who had a major
health problem at around the same time
as a vaccination
I I don't know about you but at my age I
tend to have some major health issue
every year
do you
now when I say major I mean like I had
problems with my blood pressure meds and
you know at one point my sinuses were
bad at one point I had some reaction
from some other meds and you know I got
I thought my fitness declined quite a
bit for a while during the pandemic so I
had all these things that
I could have said you know I might have
said we're due to the uh shot but what
if it's something like this it caught my
my eye either six percent of the public
is sensitive to gluten and almost the
same number believe they had vaccine
side effects
do you think it could be as simple as
there's some people who have a specific
allergy and and they did have bad
outcomes with the vacs
yeah I I don't know I don't know if you
I don't know if the vaccine is something
you can have an allergy to because it
has to be alive doesn't have to be alive
to give you an allergic reaction
technically
oh I think it does
it doesn't have to be alive to give you
I think there's like a technical
definition that requires something to be
alive but you could have a bad reaction
to something that's not alive
so it looks the same
all right so here's what I'd say I would
say this is a super alarming in the same
way that the varus reports are
but if you take it too much beyond that
then you'd be into pretty speculative
range
all right
so I'd be worried about it apparently
there's another report on one of the
vaccinations
giving Strokes to even older people
because we know there's some extra risks
with the younger people so one of them
might actually have some older people
risk but they're looking into that
drip drip drip
so I was listening to a spaces that
audio
program on Twitter and there was a
conversation about the vaccine injury
and stuff and Alex Berenson was there
and
there's they were talking about the fact
that there are more vaccinated people
being hospitalized and having bad
outcomes than unvaccinated
and it was an extended conversation and
while I was listening to it I didn't
hear the whole thing I didn't hear
anybody bring up the obvious point
that whether the vaccines work or don't
work at least the way we currently you
know the way the doctors currently say
they work which is not spreading not
stopping the spread but rather helping
you survive whether
uh so here's what here's what they were
not saying how would you interpret the
fact that it's mostly the heavily
boosted more boosters you have the more
likely you have a bad outcome what's
your interpretation of that
your interpretation is that the vaccine
not only doesn't work
it gives you a negative a negative
impact right
because that's not my interpretation
well that seems to be the way everybody
else is interpreting it and I'm trying
to figure out is it me
all right here's my interpretation
what group of people are most likely to
get boosted
the people who spend the most time
around people in crowds because they
would have the most chance of getting
infected and the people were weak and
old and have co-morbidities
if you took just the group of people who
have comorbidities and around lots of
people
and compared to them you know forget
about vaccinations just compare the
people who are weak and around a lot of
people to the people who are healthy and
not around a lot of people would they
have the same amount of
um outcomes it should be hugely
different right the old people are dying
like crazy the young people is just a
sniffle
right now which group is more likely to
get the most shots and the most boosters
the ones who know they have no real risk
to begin with
and they're not around people all the
time
what are the people who are around
people
and also have the highest risk they
should the ones who are around people
should be the most vaccinated the ones
who are also have comorbidities or
they're old
so if you took that group and you
decreased the risk by half I'm just
making up a number if you decrease that
the the vulnerable group I have it
should still be way higher than the
people who never got vaccinated at all
even if
the vaccination worked great
so these numbers tell me
the vaccination could be working great
if it reduced the risk by half but it's
still like you know two or three times
more than the healthy people that's
exactly what I'd expect
so the numbers are exactly what I'd
expect if the vaccine
did protect people
I'm not saying it yet that's not my
claim because we don't know right we
could be surprised tomorrow you know
tomorrow we learn all kinds of new stuff
who knows and it hasn't been tested for
long enough that you can be sure about
anything
but
here's my problem
I don't know if that's a good point
and here's a here's what I would need to
know
when they do these studies of who's
hospitalized
are they looking at people with the same
comorbidities
vaccinated versus unvaccinated or are
they looking at healthy people who
didn't get vaccinated much
compared to unhealthy people who are
around a lot of people all the time who
did get vaccinated
because that's probably what it is
if all they did is look at the outcomes
then they didn't do the study right it's
just a dumb study
now
I always mentioned Andre's back house
you know because he's better than I am
by a lot in looking at data and figuring
out if at least the analysis is correct
or they've you know confused correlation
and causation and I believe his exact
um his exact comment
on the of this stuff was lol
I don't know exactly what he's thinking
but I don't think it was worth more than
an LOL
because there's no way that they've
sorted out causation from correlation
I don't think so
and and there was nobody on that spaces
call who would even bring up the
question now again I'm not sure it's the
right question because if they really
controlled the study somehow
and then maybe maybe they controlled for
it but I doubt it I don't think they
could
it's proven to Scott no it's the data
might be proven
the data might be proven
but the interpretation is sketchy
now is it cognitive dissonance if I
allow that both possibilities are
entirely
entirely possible
cognitive dissonance is almost always
when you've made up your mind I'm
telling you explicitly both
possibilities are alive
can you hear that or not Edith Eve is
yelling cognitive distance Edith your
incognitive dissonance you're
experiencing it you're totally you're
totally having a hallucination because
I'm the one saying either one is
possible and the data allows both
interpretations you're saying I'm having
cognitive dissonance that's cognitive
distance you are experiencing it because
you have some certainty about something
that couldn't be certain
no you are no you are you projected
person
laughs
people think they could read my body
language and determine that I'm being
disingenuous
okay
all right here's the problem I keep
having when I bring up the same point
everybody goes quiet
what's wrong with you today
why does everybody go quiet when I bring
up that point every time
some people are just triggered into
cognitive dissonance but the rest of you
are just sort of commenting you know
indirectly
in general
I don't see people saying Scott I agree
with your interpretation
do you agree with my interpretation or
no
that my interpretation is well my
interpretation is that there are two
interpretations and they're both alive
at the moment
okay
so I think that needs to be at least
part of every conversation on this or it
doesn't feel
doesn't feel real
all right
um
that's about all I had in this I'd like
to say again even though that I think I
believe Alex Berenson is misinterpreting
this data
but I like to say that uh I think he's a
valuable asset to the country
because I do like the fact that people
were pushing really hard against the
safety claims of the vaccines they might
you know they may
be uh overzealous but you need that like
Society really needed you know these
people pushing hard who were credible
people so I appreciate Alex bernson's
service to the country I don't know if
he's you know got every question right
but that's not how I would judge him I
wouldn't judge him by whether he got
everything right during a pandemic
because nobody did right so so I'm not
going to judge anybody for being
wrong during a pandemic I told you in
the beginning of the pandemic I wasn't
going to do it and I'm trying to be
consistent
foreign all right
uh did I miss anything
any uh any stories happening that I
missed
are you going to talk about the
Democrats uh being hunted in New Mexico
now is that the story about the serial
killer who
there was a serial killer who hunted
down some Democrats
I did I did see something like that I I
typically don't talk about uh crime
stories
but if but that's worth mentioning so
the Republicans are always talking about
I'm always talking about uh Republicans
being hunted but there was a case of
somebody who looks like they went out
and just tried to kill some Democrats
and we of course condemn that at the
highest possible level
but yeah that that's a fair comment and
see now that's the kind of criticism
that I appreciate
because that that was first of all
totally fair
that there was something that was
counter to my narrative that I didn't
mention
now again the reason is because I don't
talk about specific crimes too much
that's sort of my thing I don't talk
about them but in that case I should
have you're right that absolutely should
have been mentioned as the
the you know counterbalance so good for
you
I like it when you call me on stuff
that's you know as clearly wrong as that
was
all right
uh what did Crenshaw say
Crenshaw is supporting military against
the cartels
well there we go
is there anybody who doesn't
now
I'm going to ask you a question that I
know I'm going to get mocked for
all right
I sometimes think that one of my special
uh let's say services that I can do for
the Republic
are to take something that you can't
talk about
and normalize it so that it becomes part
of the option set because there's some
things that people just won't say first
because whoever goes first will just get
shot down
and I'm pretty sure I've been the
loudest
public voice about a military
intervention in Mexico
and I said it loudly and clearly I
supported it and I will argue it in
public
I'll argue with anybody who wants and
I'll make my case because it has to be
part of the option set now
I believe that I did enough of it
that it demonstrated that people were
more open to it than maybe you would
have assumed wouldn't you agree there
was plenty of pushback on the Practical
part of it and there should be
like I don't want to I don't want to
recommend a war and have nobody in the
United States disagree do you want to
live in that country no no I always want
a healthy disagreement about war like
yes no that should be the biggest fight
we ever have but it should be a fair
fight right we should we should be
serious about it about whether we ever
use military force but I put that out
there and I think after people ask
questions about you know how it could
work and are you serious and what would
it look like
largely people I think accepted it as an
option
would you agree
now I'm not you know I suppose maybe
somebody else talked about it and I'm
not aware of it
but
um as Lance says you never did that can
somebody tell Lance
that for a long time I've been saying we
should attack the cartels militarily a
long time
and and I've been saying it publicly on
live stream I've said it on Twitter
and I think that helps normalize it
because remember what happened when uh
who was it who talked about uh Trump
brought it up once privately
and one of his staffers basically just
shot him down like like it's not even
something you can talk about
and that's what I wanted to change I
wanted to make sure that Trump could say
that in public
which he did he put in a video saying it
directly because I think he saw that the
the room had been softened enough
that you could say it and you could
defend it
so
anyway
I normalized more war well war is
normalized isn't it
do you think I did that
pretty sure that was normalized a long
time ago we haven't been out of a war
since I can remember
yeah I would love whoever said that was
crazy to say that to me
do you think they would
say so
I mean
I would I would just eviscerate anybody
who said that it just would be it would
be just destruction on camera
all right
oh he also implied to many rallies
earlier too yeah but I think the direct
the direct statement that special forces
will go in and obliterate the the
cartels operation that was the part that
he he says directly Trump does and it's
the reason that I'm going to back him
because I'm a single issue voter I'm a
single issue voter on fentanyl so
whatever Trump does that you don't like
not my problem
yeah he can defend that as himself
all right
would politician families be targeted by
the cartels if we bomb them probably
the Virginia Merit scholar story oh yeah
yeah
is the story that in Virginia
um some students were not informed that
they'd won the National Merit
Scholarship
they were not informed in time to put it
on the resume which would have helped
them get into a better College
they were told after but only the white
ones
so somebody held back the white people
now if that's true that's a horrible
crime
like this isn't one that
was was it all agents yeah maybe it was
just basically anti-asian and anti-white
mostly Asians all right well so what
whatever whatever group was uh held back
there that is huge
that when I heard that story like I
almost couldn't believe it
like we did get to the point where that
would be done intentionally
yeah that's somebody should go to jail
for that don't you think
I would think that's I don't know if
it's a crime but it ought to me
13 schools God
that's just amazing
yes for over a year oh my God
yeah
uh life after death life after death
would just be the end of the simulation
for you
but it might mean that you're you know I
also think we might be inhabited by
another species
who just uses this when we're awake
so they would it would just be like a
video game where you turn off the video
game
that's all it would be
yeah they should lose something for
doing that all right is there any other
story I missed
I think I'm all good
uh
uh all right
it would be the only fish on the other
hand when you asked it about marriage it
was clearly they can't do complex math
analysis how would you be judging when
to trust it and when oh so chat GPT this
is a good question you know when would
you trust that to do searches well it's
not connected to the internet
so right now all it is using basically
everything it knows about language
to create intelligence as soon as it's
connected to the internet then we'll be
able to check its answers against the
manual search and then you'll either be
comfortable with it or not but I think
it'll take a while to evolve to where
it's better
um
all right
just looking at your
classified documents
oh what do you think of Trump's claim
that he kept hundreds of classified
documented folders
empty folders because they were cool
souvenirs
believe it or not
do you think you would keep them as cool
souvenirs
I thought of one situation in which he
might
right my first reaction was that doesn't
sound like a good explanation
who would keep empty folders and I
thought to myself
imagine if he wanted to create a piece
of art
in which the wall was just all the empty
classified folders and I think maybe
some of them had different fronts
so imagine a display of empty folders
it's just you know the flat folders on a
wall and you would know what was in
those folders
they wouldn't be in there but but you
know somehow like this one was about
North Korea and this one was about
nuclear weapons and stuff because it
would be like a like a visual
representation of Trump's job in office
his job in office was hey look at this
secret file and let's make some
decisions and then that would be like
the tapestry of his of his uh term
and there wouldn't be any details it'd
just be a visual representation of how
many Secrets a president has to do now
if he had said that I don't think
anybody would believe it but when I
thought about it I thought you know that
would actually be a really cool display
wouldn't it be
like you know a wall of just of just the
folders the empty folders it would be
kind of cool I I would stop and look at
it and I would also think oh those
folders
every one of those folders was touched
by the president of the United States
and had a state secret in it
which would be kind of cool
I have a request for a parting sip for
the YouTube people
and I think I will comply
here's your parting sip
for this great live stream I'm going to
talk to the locals people after
join me now in the party except
ah hi YouTube thanks for joining I'll
see you tomorrow
