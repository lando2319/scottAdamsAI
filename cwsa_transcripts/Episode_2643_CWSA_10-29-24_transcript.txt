is take he on a tear it's up 11% this
morning I don't recommend Stocks by the
way but sometimes I mention ones that I
have that doesn't mean you should have
them because I'm not such a good
investor it turns out I wish I were but
I'm
not so don't be like me although I must
say my early years didn't go well
because I did some high-risk stuff but
lately it's been just fine
right we got a show for you today boy do
we have a
show
whoa whoa oh no I have a
problem
R Scott's got a problem here with his
notes that apparently have been printed
out of
order if I don't fix that it's going to
be a really weird day
[Music]
fixed good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a better time in the
whole stinking world but if you'd like
to take your experience up to levels
that nobody can even understand with
their tiny shiny human brains all you
need is a cuper mug or a glass of tanker
gel orstein a canting Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine hit of the day and this one
goes to Steve Bannon who is freed from
jail I believe at this very moment Steve
this one's for you from all of us
good
stuff it's all coming together now can
you feel
it it's the Golden Age M can't be
stopped you can stop it if you
tried but you
won't well here are some things that are
happening yesterday I uh I was a guest
on uh Jen's show Jen yuger on the the
Young
kks and uh he asked me to explain my
support of trump and I did my best in
our half hour that we we had together
but I would like to just give a public
shout out and compliment to Jen for
number
one uh hosting a number of people who
disagreed with them you know separately
I was I was separate from them but
um his uh his treatment of me and my
opinion was completely professional and
uh
admirable I'm glad I did that um a lot a
lot of you were warning me don't do it
he's going to talk over you and um there
was none of that there was no talking
over now one of the things I I try to
teach my subscribers that I'll tell the
rest of you
too if somebody's talking over
you sometimes that's on them you know
there some people are just talker overs
but it doesn't really happen to me that
much and I think it's because you can
manage it the first thing you have to do
is make sure that you listen to them and
not talk over them the second thing is
don't say crazy if you say crazy
stuff people will talk over you if you
act like you didn't hear what they just
said they'll say it again and talk over
you so there's just some basic
communication tools where you make sure
you're listening to them you make sure
you hear them and then make sure that
you know that they've heard you you Pace
them a little bit and then the the most
important part is don't be an
NPC because if all you're doing is
throwing in the the same talking point
that everybody said 100 times today
you're G to get talked over because
nobody needs to hear it and people are
thinking okay it's just a talking point
let me talk over it so you have to be a
little bit interesting and different so
people want to know how you finish your
sentence you've got to give the same
consideration to whoever you're talking
to that you don't overtalk them which by
the way I did so I'm going to give uh
Jen a double
compliment because he didn't he didn't
once try to overt talk me but a couple
times he said something that I couldn't
let go that I I tried to overtalk him a
little bit um so great job thank you and
uh Banner is out of jail as I mentioned
so um we're going to be hearing from him
and I feel like it's a
sign yeah sure it was scheduled you know
we knew for a long time that Bannon was
going to get out and about now but still
it feels like a sign doesn't
it can you feel it did you feel every
single pole turning in Trump's
direction did you feel Peter Navaro get
out of
jail Bannon get out of jail Trump's
lawfare
collapsing Biden
collapsing you feel it now don't you
yeah something big is
happening well let's talk about some
uh some surveys in science according to
Medical Express is a survey that finds
Americans are more afraid today than at
any time in recent history and when I
say afraid I mean sort of afraid of
everything in in the world coming to get
them now they could have saved some
money just by asking Scott CU I could
have told them that and I would tell
them why why are people more afraid
number one we can see all the problems
in our immediate environment which is
the way we evolved but now we can see
all the problems everywhere in the
world I I didn't even know there was a
supply chain problem happening uh
somewhere in another country that's
going to make me starve to death maybe
so the fact that you know what where all
the problems are and you're predicting
problems 80 years in the future with
climate change yeah you're simply being
exposed to a thousand times more
problems how
about how about the fact that every time
you open your phone the way that anybody
gets clicks is by scaring you so not
only do you have physical access to a
thousand problems but they're going to
go right to the top of your attention
feed because those are the ones that get
clicks of course you're more afraid and
so as long as hate is being
monetized and then the then the last
reason we're more afraid is that we
understand
more if you didn't know anything about
the national debt wouldn't you be
happier because there's nothing you can
do about it so if you just didn't know
we did we had any national debt
wouldn't you be a little happier yeah so
the more you know about how our election
systems are run how money flows uh how
real decisions are
made uh how how the medical world
decides what's what treatment they're
going to give you and what not once you
once you learn that
stuff the world is scarier because we
were you know treated like children for
most of you know most of Society but
lately we're not being treated like
children because we have access to the
the hard
stuff all right there's a study uh by
something called
cath really that's the name of the
entity that has this CA that sounds like
ca caffeine but anyway it's about uh
Brewing up benefits of coffee did you
know that coffee among its many many
benefits might preserve muscle mass as
we
age yeah I stopped exercising years ago
and just doubled up on coffee and my
muscles are just twice as big now so I'm
just sucking up coffee to make my brain
stronger and my muscles bigger and
that's how I'm playing
it um there's a study by the University
of Cambridge that says if you apply
magnetic fields to both sides of the
brain you get rapid improvement from dep
compression that's amazing so just
magnets on both sides of your head well
I'm not going to let that science go by
without testing it so I got to magnet
out of my closet because I have a closet
where I keep a lot of magnets yes I have
a whole closet has a lot of magnets get
over it I like
magnets they're really
cool look what they do they pull them
apart and they come back
together you can't do that it's cool so
I thought I'd test it see if I get
anything now you should not do this at
home um so I'm going to do magnetic
therapy on my head to see if it cures my
depression at all now apparently I need
to hold it on both sides of that they
they've done it they've done it with
just one device but there's something
about having it on both sides that this
seems to help so I'm going to give you a
live demonstration see if it cures my my
depression at
all you
ready first we'll get the Baseline how
am I
feeling H yeah actually pretty good I
think the uh golden age is coming I
think Trump's going to win I think all
of her problems are going to be solved
okay so I'm not a really good candidate
for testing for depression since I don't
have any but maybe maybe it'll make me
even happier than I am so hold on we're
going to apply the magnets and
see I think it's
working I support kble Harris for
president
[Music]
what did I just say I don't
remember I I don't remember what I just
say I hope it made sense did it make
sense I hope it wasn't crazy
 don't don't tell me I screamed out
some crazy
 no I don't want to know about
that all right well but more importantly
scientists have created a revolutionary
ultra thin film that absorbs 99% of
electromagnetic waves
did you know that 99% of your
electromagnetic waves can be absorbed by
a thin film Ultra it's ultra thin it's
not even thin now you want to know
something
cool if that ultra thin film that
absorbs 99% of electromagnetic waves if
it also made magnets not not attracted
to each other if let's say you put it
between two magnets if you could put it
between two magnets and make them not do
that you would have free energy
forever because I've already designed an
engine that is only one missing part
because nobody's invented it yet a thin
a thin barrier that can go between two
natural
magnets that does not exist there's no
such thing as something you can put
between two
magnets unless it's a magnet itself and
then that will just divert the magnetic
field but there's nothing there's
nothing that's a material that you could
put between two magnets to even reduce
their amount of Attraction even a little
bit you know wouldn't you think that oh
okay if I put something thick in there
that's not
magnetic like lead like or a piece of
gold or something you'd say well there's
no way it's going to be exactly as
magnetically attracted but it is it's
exactly the same even even with like a
thick barrier between them this is the
thing that got me most interested in
understanding the reality and that maybe
everything we think about reality is
wrong how in the world could no barrier
slow down
magnets it just suggests that what you
think is reality is probably way off
probably way
off here's another study that says
intelligent men exhibit stronger
commitment and lower hostility in Roman
antic relationships according to S poost
huh huh how could they have saved some
money on this study well you could have
asked me because it seems to me that in
every situation that requires
thinking now work with me here smarter
people do
well did you know that yeah if you take
a smart person and you say hey we're
going to try to make some lawyers who
does better the smart people if you take
some smart people and say we're going to
make some doctors out of you which ones
do better Smart Ones that's the Smart
Ones if you want to do some advanced
math do you pick smart people or dumb
people to do it not smart people smart
people if you want to have a
relationship in which people work at it
and figure out the nuances of it and
really try to understand each other and
try to master the the the skill of
communicating in a way that's not
offensive and all those other things you
have to do to make a relationship work
do you think that smart people do better
or do you think the dumb people just
nailing it no it's the smart people it
turns out that being
intelligent is beneficial in a wide
variety of
domains I know who knew right who
knew I was just saying a a interview
with
uh with Conor
McGregor and someone was asking about
how he knew how he knew something about
how a fight was going to go because
apparently he predicted the exact
Exchange in a fight and then he did it
in one and uh you hear Conor McGregor
talk and the first thing you say is oh
this man does not have a
PhD the second thing you think is what
he's saying is making a lot of sense and
then the further the longer he talks the
more sense it makes and then you end up
saying oh I get it he's really
smart that's why he's Conor McGregor
there are a lot of guys who are strong
and fast and tough and can take a punch
but I think he's smarter than
them and that's probably why he's you
know the richest one who ever did
that
um all right what else is going on here
so I saw a clip uh it was an MSNBC clip
in which one of the
propagandists was uh making the point
that if there are five generals that
work for Trump and all five of them say
that Trump said bad things behind closed
doors what are the odds I mean what are
the odds that all five all five generals
lied I think it was uh medy Assan who
was saying that
now let me do it the way he was doing it
I mean what are the odds all five really
really you think all five generals like
the most trusted people in our military
that's how they became just you think
five of them all five of them just made
stuff up and lied to the public is that
what you
think to which I replied on social media
today well we had 51 intelligence
professionals lie about hunter's laptop
we had hundreds of government and media
Pros lie about Russia collusion when
they knew it wasn't true we had
thousands of government and media Pros
lie about the fine people hoax and
dozens of other hoaxes thousands
thousands thousands of people
lied about the fine people hoax
thousands we had millions of medical
professionals lie during the pandemic
Millions
Millions Millions lied during
the
pandemic and we've got millions of
scientists lying right now about the
reliability of climate models now I
won't get into the you know the debate
on climate science but clearly they're
lying about the reliability of the
models at the very least they're lying
about that so yes five lying generals is
the lowest bar you could ever get get
because first of all generals are
waiting for the big paycheck right all
the generals want the big paycheck after
you know retired and get on that Big
Board and sell some weapons you know
what I mean so first of all I don't
trust generals because they didn't get
there the normal way they got there
through political appointment they are
Political Animals and every other entity
that as officials has lied to
us getting five generals to lie the same
lie about Trump is probably the easiest
 thing you could ever do so now I
don't trust the five generals and if you
give me 25 I'm not going to trust them
either we don't have a world in which we
can trust our five
generals sorry I don't make the rules
that they may be the five generals who
have the most influence on whether we go
to war but that doesn't mean I have to
trust
them and I don't
well the Washington Post story is
getting more interesting so Jeff Bezos
weighed in as you know the Washington
Post decided it's not going to endorse a
candidate even though many of the
employees wanted to endorse Harris and
some of them quit and protest so Bezos
WR wrote a letter to his uh I think it
was to his own employees but we got to
see it and he said among other things
quote it would be easy to blame others
for our long and continuing fall in
credibility but a victim mentality will
not help complaining is not a strategy
we must work harder to control what we
can control to increase our
credibility I'll tell you see that's one
two three three
sentences can can you tell why he's one
of the richest people in the
world in three
sentences you can tell that Jeff Bezos
is one of the richest people in the
world or or if he isn't he's going to
be the the level of
just pure intelligence that comes out of
everything he says is sort of hard to
miss right let let me let me point it
out here it would be easy to blame
others and have a victim
mentality what's that sound
like that sounds like everybody was ever
successful as soon as you the victim
mentality and you're dead that's rule
number one rule number one is you got to
get rid of the victim mentality now that
happens to also agree with I'd say more
of a republican conservative point of
view is he also signaling that he's not
going to be a slave to the
left I feel like
it I feel like he told us two things one
is don't be don't have a victim
mentality that's good that's a good
entrepreneurial management thing to say
good leadership secondly he's not your
slave that that that's basically
declaring his freedom he just said I'm
not your
slave in a
way he said complaining is not a
strategy okay that's a good
reframe complaining is not a strategy in
other words you can do it but I'm not
going to listen to it and it won't make
any difference if you have an idea
I'll listen to an idea and if it's a
good idea I might even do it but
complaining is not an idea complaining
is not a
strategy I I want I swear to God I want
to go take a job for working for Bezos
now like I just want to I want to apply
for a job in his paper and then he says
we must work harder to control what we
can
control
yes control the parts you can control
and stop complaining about the things
you can't
control yes that is perfect no wasted
words in
that what else he said uh he he pointed
out how it used to be that uh the
reporting profession the news was the
second least respected entity but now
Congress was always number one least
respected but apparently the news
business is now surpassed Congress as
the least
respected entity in the United
States which he points
out he also says that presidential
endorsements do nothing to SK tip the
scales and no UND decided voters in
Pennsylvania are going to say I'm going
with a newspaper a is endorsement none
what presidential endorsements actually
do is create a perception of
bias h
a perception of
non-independence ending them as a
principal decision okay do you see what
he just
did he let he left the world of fact and
he went into the world of perception
persuasion he said we we're we're doing
anti-p persuasion we're persuading
people that were
biased because when you when you say
this is how you should vote what am I
supposed to think I'm supposed to think
your entity is
biased so even if it's not
biased don't do things that make you
look biased is that good advice yes yes
that's really good
advice um is it true though that the
newspaper endorsements don't tip the
scales um yes and
no I'm going to say he he's close enough
to yes that I'll give him the yes on
that the no would be that there's a
group think element that's not
addressed uh if you mean if only one
newspaper made one recommendation would
it make much difference no because other
newspapers are doing other things Etc
but if the newspapers
collectively look at the big ones like
the Washington Post and say oh we don't
want to be on the other side of the
Washington Post then it might make the
majority of news papers lean in One
Direction and if the majority is leaning
in One Direction that's telling you what
is
acceptable civil
Behavior so it could collectively but
not
individually um here's something that I
didn't know
about um according to Ian miles Jung one
of the uh editors the uh the then
editor-in Chief was a guy named Robert k
I think he might be one of the ones who
just
left U but he's married to Victoria
nuland did you know that that that an
editor at the Washington Post was
married to the person who is most often
identified as the source of all
government
evil now I don't I don't personally know
too much about her I'm just saying if
you listen to Glenn Greenwald or Mike
Ben talking about you know who's
starting the wars and who are the
neocons and who who are running the
plays behind the scenes and you know
overthrowing countries and doing all the
bad stuff it's always Victoria newand
she's the major name that comes out of
all those conversations as the you know
the the center piece of all that now her
husband was also the you know one of the
main uh decision bers at the Washington
Post which is one of the main
newspapers now remember what I always
tell
you if the only thing you know is what's
happening you don't know anything you
don't know anything if you know who the
players are well suddenly it all makes
sense this is one of those cases now I
also wonder somebody also mentioned that
uh the the Bezos uh divorce you know his
wife took half his fortune and is
pouring it into Democrat Lefty stuff um
it might
be that Bezos has some reaction to that
meaning that he might feel at the very
least he might want to balance it out
maybe it's personal we can't read his
mind so we don't know that um there's no
evidence is personal but if you put any
of us in that situation it would be
personal
right if you switched places with
Bezos and your wife just took you know a
hundred billion dollar from you that
that he earned and she didn't and she's
pumping it into things that he doesn't
agree with you don't think You' take
that
personally that your ex-wife spending
hundreds of billions of dollars on stuff
you don't want to be spent on after
after you earned it
all I would take that personally now
that doesn't mean he is there's no
evidence of that but wow you put me in
that position I don't think I could be
objective
anyway um there's another newspaper the
USA Today is joining The Washington Post
in LA Times and not
endorsing uh a president this
time so I thought it would be a good
time to give you a little whiteboard U
explanation of what the media landscape
has looked like and what it is becoming
now this is the sort of thing that I
sometimes forget that normies don't
already know now normies would be people
who just consume the news um most of my
Adult Career I've been associated with
newspapers and Publishing so you know
I've been sort of semi inside the circle
and so I get I get to see it a little
differently than you do so that's why I
get to explain it to
you let's start with the Legacy
situation Legacy meaning how how has it
been up until
now let's get you all centered up
there so in the old days which are still
partly the current days here's how I
learned it when I when I learned about
how everything works in the real world
there there are or have been two
entities called news makers that would
be the New York Times And The Washington
Post now a news maker is somebody who if
they have a major story then all the
other news people have to cover it if a
local newspaper broke a story the big
ones could just ignore it if they wanted
to and that happens a lot but if either
the New York Times or the Washington
Post decides to make a big deal of it
then all the others will fall in line
because hey news just got
made now the the the rest of the media
um I will call them boosters so once the
big entities tell you this is the news
this is what you should think about and
talk about then the others say okay this
is what everybody's going to think and
talk about today so we'll do that and
they fall in line now this does not
require any phone calls it requires no
messaging it literally requires all the
other people to just read the other
papers which they do uh pretty much
everybody in the news business is going
to make sure that they're looking at at
least the New York Times but certainly
The Washington Post now Wall Street
Journal sometimes is in this category
but the but the Wall Street Journal is a
little more Finance oriented and a
little more independent little more
balanced doesn't quite fit here but
sometimes it
does the boosters I would say uh are are
not doing a lot of original work they're
just copying work from other people and
boosting it and then it gets to what I
call the
propagandists the the people who talk
about it and they frame it a certain way
and they leave out context so they're
they're opinion people but really
they're
propagandists they're
not very few of them are trying to give
you their best honest opinion they're
promoting aside
basically so MSNBC doesn't really even
pretend to be news they use the news to
add opinions to it but they're not
really a news organization they're
propaganda the the Atlantic the deli
bees Rolling Stones and pretty much all
the pundits that you see all day long
are propagandists now under this model
how hard is it for the government to
control the entire media
landscape do you see how easy it
is they only need two people all they
need is whoever makes the decisions at
the New York Times and whoever makes the
decisions at the Washington Post if you
want to if you want to learn more about
that uh a care remember the movie but
Merill I think Merill stre played the
uh the owner of the Washington Post in
kenedy's Era I forget what the movie is
but there there's a movie you can find
it's only a few years old um and it's
fascinating because you could see for
example that Kennedy would invite like
the top people who owned the newspapers
on his
yacht imagine imagine being a newspaper
professional
and somebody as charismatic as a Kennedy
invites you to be their personal friend
and spend the weekend on their
yacht what are you going to write about
them
right it was completely corrupt yeah
that they should not be riding anybody's
Yachts if they're going to write about
them so in the old days the government
um in that case I don't think it was
Kennedy so much it might have been the
Deep state that killed them that was
running things but all you had to do was
get literally just two
people and how hard is it to get two
people on your side if you're a
government well you have all of the
bribery possibilities all the jailing
possibilities all of the you know access
to resources access to
interviews you have all the power so
there there's no problem at all to get
two people to do whatever you want if
you're the government right any
government can make any two people do
anything they want but
enter Elon
Musk and look what
happens here's a model of how things are
are evolving you got fake
news and then you have some real news
and it's coming from everywhere so it's
coming from not only the newsmakers but
everywhere else and a lot of independent
journalists now we have much more far
more independent journalist
but both the fake stuff and the real
stuff is being fed into the
xplatform and then it gets um
light basically the light is shined on
it and then the fake stuff gets called
out not as fast as I'd like but it does
get called out and the truth gets
essentially adjudicated through
X and everybody pays attention to X if
they're in the media so it makes a big
difference
now they don't get the truth every time
sometimes it's wrong but they get a lot
closer than the media that is designed
to be fake yeah the stuff on the other
side of the Whiteboard is designed to
create fake news to hold the country
together and have one narrative it's
designed to be fake with the little
little real stuff sprinkled in but uh
the
musk uh
xplatform is putting the truth back into
the hands of the public because the
public fights it down on X and something
like the truth
emerges now enter Jeff
Bezos what he says is he wants to add
credibility and he wants to add some
conservative
voices what does that sound like to you
what what if what if he takes it to the
extreme and actually gets rid of all the
um people who are just propag
and instead replaces them with people
who
are um
credible but can represent the left and
then some people who are credible who
could represent the right and then maybe
have them fight it out in you know
within their internal pages to give you
another sense of
Truth now here's a
problem suppose he
succeeds and I do expect he will because
he has the resources the brains the
energy the the magic the skill
everything so what what if the
Washington Post gets resurrected from
the uh the trash heap of History where
it is now and becomes an actual place
where people go okay okay I could go to
x and get a version of the truth or I
could go to Washington Post and get a
version of the truth but they're both
pretty good because they're both trying
to get the truth
do you see the problem
yet here's my
problem they're both in the space
business in a big
way
Rockets they kind of have to do what the
government wants them to
do that they have two businesses well
really you could argue all of their
businesses are completely dependent on
the government's not taking them down
so are we really safe when
billionaires who depend on the
government for some huge part of their
business life are the ones you know
designing the systems of
truth I'm not terribly comfortable with
that you know if you tell me that musk
is one source and then there are other
sources but that they come from all
different kinds of Worlds I would say oh
that's good that's a competitive market
so I won't worry about this one person
having a connection to the government
you know and having to get approval for
rockets and stuff like that because they
they're non-rocket people also involved
but what if there
aren't what if the truth becomes two
billionaires who depend on the
government to say yes or no on their
Rockets that's not exactly where you
want to be with your information Network
so you you know it's good to have them
but I think you'd want a lot more so
that's where we're headed and it also
tells you why the government and lots of
people the Democrats especially are
panicked about X because he creating for
the first
time an alternative path of news
knowledge so that's
happening well the uh joke by Tony
uh what's his name I can't remember the
comedian who told the off-color joke at
the Trump rally in Madison Square guardy
hinchley Tony hinchley is that his name
I've never seen him work
actually um but apparently the Democrats
have succeeded in making his joke uh a
national problem and uh getting all the
Puerto Rican Americans all Angry so that
they'll vote against them and
stuff um but now Trump is going to be in
Pennsylvania in an area that apparently
has a sizable Puerto Rican American well
Puerto Ricans are Americans but Puerto
Rican U population
and people are asking him to
apologize now this will be fun so you
got Trump the man who doesn't
apologize and you've got a few days
before the election it's really tight
and an important group of potential of
Voters is saying we need an
apology and they're asking the man who
doesn't
apologize but maybe he needs to to win
the election what do you do what do you
do well here's what I do uh everybody's
going to give him
advice um but Trump's going to do it
Trump's way and so far that's work for
him I mean he's knocking on the door to
a second uh second term so I don't think
that we should be so arrogant as to
imagine that if we gave him a suggestion
on how to handle it that our suggestion
would be better than whatever the hell
he's going to do but it's recreationally
u fun to come up with what would you do
if you were in that situation so this
will be more what I would do what he
does is going to be better it's going to
be the Trump thing but I'll tell you
what I'd do I'd do something like this
if I were the man who couldn't apologize
or or don't want to and
um I had this
situation I'd listen to the question
and' be blah blah blah you know do you
apologize for this blah blah blah here's
what I'd say I don't think it's a good
idea for me to police
comedy first sentence I don't think it's
a good idea for me to police comedy it's
not really what you want your government
to do in fact you probably want your
government to get as far away from that
as possible CU free speech is where you
don't want
me so I'll give you my opinion but don't
ask me to police to police comedy if
you're asking was a uh a mistake to let
that joke go off in public oh I think we
all agree on that yes that that wasn't
ideal so we can agree that a mistake was
made but we don't police comedy comedy
is not about hitting a home run every
time and we don't expect it to so
policing a bad joke or joke that went
too far that's not really where you want
me to be involved but I'll tell you what
I will do one of the things that Tony
brought up is the fact that there's an
enormous problem in Puerto Rico that I
don't think all of you were aware of
which is partly why people are angry
there is a
massive um environmental problem in
Puerto Rico that's not being addressed
so I'd like to announce
today that should I become president I'm
going to make that a priority and we're
going to clean that up so here's the
apology I'll give you I'm going to clean
up your
Island Hing Cliffe is his
name Tony Hing Cliffe sorry if I had the
name
wrong so how's
that because you know what the President
should be promising Puerto Rico to help
them clean up that they should help
them clean up I mean I I had no idea it
was so bad my my entire attitude about
Puerto Rico went from I don't know
anything about Puerto Rico to why aren't
we doing more to help Puerto Rico who
did that Tony hinchcliff
did why are we talking about uh why am I
talking about I think we should put more
money into Puerto Rico a
comedian so Trump trump can be right
twice he can say I'm not going to police
comedy but you know what he did raise an
issue that's important enough I think we
should all care about it why don't we
help Puerto Rico and just don't police
comedy what do you think that's a
winning message I'm not going to police
comedy I'm going to fix your
Island what else do you want right what
else do you
want nothing that's everything you
want um
what
else you probably heard that uh KLA
Harris and she was talking to Governor
Whitmer and they did a little stage
scene where they were sitting at a bar
pretending to drink beers and saying
stuff and
um haris said something about they need
to get men but here's my point yes it's
true that the Harris campaign needs to
get more men if they want to
win but
why are men the only demographic that
don't get
pandered every other group gets some
pandering I I literally just suggested
some pandering for Puerto Rico you know
uh Black Americans get some
pandering women get some
pandering uh Hispanics get some
pandering where's my
pandering I I'm just asking for a little
Pand drink I feel like my demographic
men
get lectured
to everybody else gets bribed but I get
shamed and lectured to how about a
little
pandering what why don't you get rid of
Dei Pander me a little bit huh how about
that
um here's my uh lesson to you on how
persuasion and intelligence are not
related in the way you think they would
you know earlier in my uh program here I
mentioned how intelligence helps you
with everything here's my
exception it doesn't help you with
persuasion if if somebody's brainwashing
you they can do it just as well
sometimes better if you're
smarter and part of the reason is that
the smart people are confident if you
give me somebody confident I can really
brainwash
them because they'll be confident that
they weren't brainwashed someone who who
knows that you have some Superior let's
say knowledge or intelligence and and
that you're trying to persuade them
they're going to think that maybe you
did so they're going to you know try to
just reject everything because they're
not confident that they can sort out
what's true and what's not so as sort of
a default they're just like I don't
trust you everything you say and that
can work out pretty well actually so
smart people are really easy to
brainwash I'm give you an
example now I'm going to use an example
from somebody that I like and
respect because I think that's important
because otherwise you would get the
message oh but really you're making fun
of this person they're really kind of
stupid but they you know maybe they got
a few smart things but they're kind of
dumb no this is a genuinely smart person
smart from top to bottom all right I'm
talking about Paul
Graham now he would be a famous investor
of Silicon Valley type forever um and I
think everybody would agree that he
would be one of the one of the smart
people in Silicon Valley now being one
of the smart people in Silicon Valley is
way better than being one of the smart
people almost everywhere else so we're
talking about way smart right not normal
smart we're we're in the the upper
levels of
smart and he's decided he likes KL
Harris as his first trade for president
and in and of itself that's just a
difference of
opinion so if if there were no reasons I
went with it then I'd say okay just a
difference of opinion and I would ask
myself is there something wrong with my
opinion um I would wonder that because
he smart enough that if he disagrees
with me the first thing I say is oh
maybe I should rethink this you know if
he musk disagreed with me on something
important my first impression would not
be well Elon Musk is
dumb my first impression would be oh
maybe I should rethink this if if Naval
ravikant came up with an opinion I
didn't agree with which I think has
never happened but if he ever
did the first thing I'd say is oh I must
be wrong and then I would definitely you
know dig into whatever the hell he was
talking about to figure out why I was
wrong so I was Paul Graham is one of the
people that if he disagrees with you
your first in Instinct should be what's
wrong with
me and then you understand him a little
better right there there's some people
your first instinct should be what's
wrong with me if they disagree so here's
something he said and my point here is
that brainwashing and intelligence
unrelated brainwashing will go right
through intelligence like it didn't
exist he said quote uh talking about
Trump he said the worst thing he did in
my opinion was when he tried to remain
in power after he lost the 2020 election
he knew he lost but he called Mike Pence
and blah blah
blah where did he get the information
that he lost the 2020
election where's that come from we don't
we don't have any way to know that and
and we certainly don't know that Trump
knew he lost
because half of the country thinks he
didn't lose and why would his opinion be
different than half of the country that
agrees with
him I'm going to be going over some uh
election irregularities next that'll be
next in my presentation here
but anybody who has been brainwashed
into thinking that we know who won any
of our
elections our our system is not even
designed so you could know it's inten
designed and I say intentionally because
you wouldn't keep it the same way for
decades and decades unless you meant it
it's intentionally designed so you can't
tell who
won now how would Paul Graham not know
that now the answer is
brainwashing how would he think that he
could read Trump's mind and even though
half of the country looked at exactly
what Trump's looking at and came to the
same conclusion As Trump that Trump
alone would be the one that's lying
but 80 million other people who have
exactly the same opinion because they
looked at exactly the same
outcomes they're not
lying like but he's the only one how
would you know that so the these are
both examples of thinking past the
sale so Paul Graham is thinking past the
sale of what did Trump do once he knew
he lost the election that is not the
situation
nobody
smart if they were working without
brainwashing as a force nobody smart
would take as an assumption that we
could know how the election went and
that it was fair for sure we do know
that the courts which are not designed
to tell us if an election is fair or not
did not find anything
wrong now uh Jen mentioned that
yesterday when I talked to him he said
that the courts didn't find anything
wrong 60 cases or something if I'd had
another
60 seconds to talk to him on that I
would have said but nobody thinks courts
have the tools to know whether an
election is is riged nobody thinks that
if a state actor got into the machines
changed the result what's the court
going to do nobody even brings him that
case the court never hears of it neither
do you because the state actor was good
at hacking so how do you catch the thing
that nobody catches it doesn't make any
sense that you could have certainty
about the election outcome nobody can
and you definitely can't have certainty
about what Trump's thinking about it and
if you were going to guess what he was
thinking about it the smarter guess is
that his guess matches the 80 million
people who who have the same bias that
they wanted to win and watch the same
outcomes they'll watch the same the same
happenings so Paul Graham if I took a IQ
test and he took an IQ test he would
beat me he's smarter than I am he knows
a lot more than I do about business and
lots of other things but uh this is the
case of
brainwashing so if you looked at this
and you said but but Scott he he's dumb
on this one little area nope nope
there's no lack of intelligence
displayed this is pure
brainwashing and you can see that it's
it got
everybody
it tell me the truth Who besides
me did you ever hear saying that we
don't have the ability to know who
won you've heard people say oh it was
definitely rigged which we don't have
evidence of and you've heard people say
it definitely was not rigged which we
could not ever
know who besides me said no if you
believe you have certainty about the
outcome you're being brainwashed from
one side or the other it doesn't matter
where your certainty is coming from but
if you have certainty about a system
that was designed to uh prevent you from
having
certainty uh that's
brainwashing yeah it's very clean and
clear this is one of those cases where
you don't have to wonder you know is
something else going on no this is
pure pure effective brainwashing and it
took me a long time to figure out how to
get out of it
it wasn't until I realized wait a
minute nobody knows if FR of our
elections are fair how could they
because how could you know that somebody
did something and got away with it
getting away with it is getting away
with
it
so
anyway uh us Intel according to Wired
Magazine are the intelligence people in
the USA that the threats of the election
are are going to come from the inside
and that we have Insider threats now an
Insider threat would be somebody
involved with the election who decided
to
cheat okay so the US
intelligence is saying that our
elections are vulnerable to insiders
cheating now if it were true that you
couldn't cheat you know without being
easily and immediately caught would the
US intelligence people say it's our
biggest
risk if they knew it was no risk at all
and you would be caught immediately if
you tried to do something as an
Insider obviously it's a real risk they
wouldn't bring it up if it weren't a
real risk I mean why would they it would
be opposite to their
interests so
okay so even our intelligence people are
saying that we can't
know if we got
hacked because if we could know then
they would say don't worry about it if
anybody tries to cheat you know we'll
catch it immediately but they didn't say
that they said it's the biggest
risk if it's the biggest risk they're
also telling us they can't catch it
immediately and if they don't catch it
immediately that's the same as never
catching it because we're going to swear
in the president and once the
president's in all the investigations
end because it's just better that
way also from
wired cyber criminals pose a greater
threat of disrupting us elections so the
idea that foreign adversaries would try
to hack our elections wired is
downplaying that uh although the foreign
adversaries are definitely trying to you
know uh they're trying to be involved
but not as grossly as changing the vote
count so it seems like they might be
trying to influence and you know send in
some memes and you know maybe maybe game
some things around the edges but it but
according to wired and I agree with this
by the way it's less likely that China
or Russia for example or Iran would hack
into a machine change the
vote and and hope they could get away
with that because I think they I think
they would say that the United States
would take that as way over the line
right it's one thing if we find out
Russia did some memes we're like H don't
do those memes Putin you and your memes
but then we look at the memes and they
didn't make any difference because they
were so stupid and they weren't viral so
we're like H okay memes but if we found
out that Russia actually got into a
machine and actually changed the results
and it actually changed the outcome of
the election that would look like
War so I agree with wi that it's
unlikely that their that their
adversaries would do that
but um cyber criminals
might meaning that if you were let's say
just a rich person and you wanted to rig
the election could you find a cyber
criminal who would do it just for money
they don't even care who wins and the
answer is I would assume
so are you telling me that a billionaire
and the best uh you know black hat
hackers can't hack our election systems
with any any amount of money to you know
be able to obtain and test systems
you're telling me that a billionaire and
the best hackers in the
world wouldn't be able to get into our
systems of course they would of course
they would and would we know if they
did of course we would not
necessarily we might but not
necessarily so so you got that risk so
you got the risk of the Insiders
coordinating you've got the risk of the
Cyber criminals and the billionaires or
whoever they're working for um and these
risks are coming from our own government
this is not me the podcaster saying oh I
think there's a risk this is our own
intelligence people saying here are two
risks that if things went wrong we would
wouldn't necessarily catch
it then we've got uh let's see according
to the Grio we had some uh uh flaming
ballot
boxes
so um where that
happen uh in Oregon and in the state of
Washington a couple of ballot boxes were
set on fire now you might say to me
Scott it's only a few b ball
boxes and that's probably true and
probably wouldn't change
uh um probably wouldn't change the
election much but uh my understanding is
there's also a lawsuit is it in
Georgia to prevent cameras on on
dropboxes why would they want to prevent
camera surveillance on
dropboxes I think the argument is that
it would decrease
votes from who
who exactly would be worried about
dropping their own ballot and maybe
their spouse's Ballot or even their
neighbors too in a
Dropbox because it's being watched by
cameras do you think somebody would not
vote the entire world is watched by
cameras obviously if you're trying to
get the cameras away from the dropboxes
you think that they're corrupt now this
is not a
suggestion but it's a semi-
prediction there may may be in this
country enough people who don't want
drop boxes to be part of the election
that they will make them not part of the
election by setting them on fire in in
numbers big enough to remove it from the
system how many dropboxes would have to
blow up or catch on fire before the
entire election would be
cancelled we got
two about
10 what what if 10 dropboxes caught on
fire because they weren't weren't being
monitored by cameras so anybody could
just drop walk up with a some some fluid
in the match and drop it in and
boom uh suppose suppose around the
entire country 10 drop boxes caught on
fire and maybe even some of the people
got
arrested would 10 be enough to say oh
stop the election probably not probably
not because somebody would say well this
Dropbox had only this the election was
this money what happens if it's
100 if aund dropboxes go set on
fire would the election be
cancelled
H
maybe maybe if a thousand of them got
caught on fire would they cancel the
election yes yes they
would do is it possible that a th000
dropboxes could be set on fire if the
results of this election don't look
um like they were
legit yes I don't recommend it you're
going to go to jail for a long time if
you do this do not do not do
not commit any crimes don't do anything
violent don't set anything on fire but
we live in a world in which two of these
have been set on fire and once the idea
gets out there it's hard to put it back
in the the box right so you could easily
imagine that there will be a
vigilante who says I'm going to
personally get rid of mailin uh
dropboxes and I'm going to drive around
the country and just for the cost of
gasoline some for my car and some for
the dropboxes and matches I'm going to
get rid of dropboxes forever and you
just drive around and set them on fire
for for two weeks and it probably
probably would take it out of the
system so that might happen
but um so that's a small problem that
could become a big problem and again
don't do that don't do that very bad
idea uh New York in York County in
Pennsylvania there's a report that 421
mail in ballots um may have gone to the
wrong addresses well that's not too many
right 421
but that's just the ones got
reported if over 400 got
reported how many were not reported it's
going to be a multiple right 5 to
one 2,000 maybe
2,000 votes
that might not be
right all right uh let's see um also in
uh York County according to the George
account one of my favorite accounts on X
you should follow
George um they they received thousands
of potentially fraudulent voter
registration forms from some third-party
group first happened in Lancaster County
and now in York County George asks
what's going
on uh George also says he's getting
information from sources this says it's
happening in more
counties and that these seem like
obvious frauds
well I don't know maybe maybe it is but
Paul Graham is sure that our our last
election was
fine um in Virginia the governor wants
to take
6600 noncitizens off the voter roles but
because there's a technicality that is
too close to elections it has to be
within outside of 90 days that the
government's not going to do it so now
we know for sure that there are at least
6,600 non-citizens that if they had a
ballot they could vote and probably
wouldn't get
caught is 6,000 a lot in Virginia I
don't
know uh then we've
got yeah three of the states uh were
suing to prevent Dropbox
surveillance George Georgia is one of
them I guess uh so that sketchy uh over
in Berkeley my neck of the woods uh
according to the
sfist um some mail ellot uh were robbed
by a mail
carrier H and didn't make it to their
destination now the current thinking is
that it wasn't that that wasn't about
the election it was just somebody stole
a mail truck maybe for with the other
stuff in
it but stuff's happened
so that all looks like uh maybe not the
most secure election system but but
really the elections are determined by
the news I would
say could could you say that's true so
just as I showed you the old Legacy news
system the government would control the
newsmakers New York Times and Washington
Post they control all the other news and
the News tells you who to vote for
doesn't it
now if if the news doesn't care or let's
say the people in charge don't care who
gets in because they're they're both
going to be easy to work with then you
get this 5050 election and then you
maybe it doesn't matter who wins but but
according to uh MRC NewsBusters that
television hits on Trump were 85%
negative news versus 78% positive for
Harris if that's the only thing you knew
that one of the candidates had
overwhelmingly negative news coverage
and one had overwhelmingly positive
that's a rigged
election right because our information
comes from the news the news determines
how we vote so if the news is rigged and
this is clear clear evidence of a rigged
news then it's a rigged election because
you if you say that the news business is
separate from the election business so
it doesn't matter what happens in the
news business that's not about the
election rigging well that's not true
the news is the election the reason that
the news entities do the debates are
because the news is part of the election
our system the news is part of the
election so if the news is rigged the
election is
rigged that's how it works if the News
tells you the the uh Hunter laptop is
fake well that is a rigged election you
know you could tell me but technically
it's a different industry the news is
separate no they're not they're
completely connected to the people who
are running in the elections there's no
separation
there let's see uh then we've got this
undercover video Steven Crowder's got
another in undercover video of what is
alleged to be a Democrat operative who's
explaining to um somebody who has got an
undercover camera uh how they Democrats
allegedly stole the 2020 election in
Georgia uh and he talks about kicking
out the GOP pole Watchers he talks about
ballot harvesting and the 2,000 mules
thing Etc here's my take on
that not
credible
sorry not credible it sounds like
somebody who watches television and then
pretended that they knew this stuff on
their own it's just all the television
stuff if if he came up with something
that wasn't already on
television but it just sounds like he's
bragging or making it up so I can't say
that I can't say that it's all false
that I don't know because that would be
a level of certainty that's inapplicable
but if you're asking me if I think they
have the goods my answer is no this does
not look like the goods this is closer
to the Kraken meaning that it's closer
to something that seems artificially too
good to be true and then if you go out
there and say it then a week later you
find out that this guy's just a
prankster or something so I'm gonna say
don't believe that
one
um yeah
um I should interview denesh well I
think the 2,000 mule thing fell apart
because they didn't have video that
supported the claim and and the people
who looked at the phone traffic said it
was uh too it was too unreliable to make
the claim that's all I know so there
there would be no point in interviewing
him because that's the whole story right
there
anyway um Trump said something that's
just magnificently trumpian because he
likes to tease things and make you all
curious so he said the Madison Square
Garden thing he said uh Donald Trump te
well he he teased that he and Matt Gates
share a quote little secret that's set
to give Republicans an edge saying quote
our secret is Making Waves will reveal
it once the race is
won and I think our little secret we're
going to do really well with the house
our little secret is having a big impact
he and I have it and we'll tell you what
it is when the race is over
huh so he has a little he has a little
secret that
involves I assume elections for the
house what could that
be uh I have I'm going to speculate just
for
fun I'm going to speculate that there
might be some Democrats who are going to
win their election and then switch to
Republican because I can't think of
anything else that would fit the hint
and you saw that there were at least two
republ two Democrats who were running as
Democrats who were using their agreement
with Trump as part of their argument for
winning as
Democrats you're aware of that right so
if you've got any Democrats that are
pretending to agree with Trump to get
elected I would say they're at least on
the fence about whether they should be
Democrats at all could it be that the
thing that Matt Gates knows is that he's
talked to several of them and he's
already convinced them to turn
Republican you know maybe they've got
some deals for some you know good
committees or something I don't know
what you can offer them but it could be
that if the election comes down close in
terms of Democrats and Republicans that
uh there's going to be a second wave
where some of the Democrats that just
came in just flip over to Republican and
the house flips now that would be a hell
of a secret
that would fit the category of it's
already happening because all the
mechanisms would be in place and it
would fit that it's a secret they
wouldn't want to talk about it until the
people got elected and Matt Gates would
be an obvious person who could be
potentially a front person for that sort
of
thing and
uh it' be big and it would evolve the
house so that's my recreational guess
if I had to put money on it I would
not so I wouldn't bet on myself because
there are too many possibilities of what
it could be but I'll throw one out
because it fits all the it fits the
hints so it's just
fun all right uh if you didn't see a
panel discussion on CNN that almost came
to blows you really have to watch it uh
cuz it had uh so CNN had uh what they
call a pro-israeli analyst Ryan
guski and what they call an anti-israel
analyst at
least whoever wrote this post whose name
I forgot to write down um and I
guess I guess uh let's see medy made a
reference to the Madison Square Garden
thing as a Hitler kind of a situation
and I guess guski did not like being
lumped in with
Hiller and so in response he he he asked
medy Hassan uh he hopes his his beeper
doesn't
explode now a beeper exploding would be
a suggestion that you're a Hezbollah
terrorist uh I think medy said he was a
Palestinian but um you know no
indication he has any terrorist
connections but uh here's my take if you
call anybody a Nazi who is not a Nazi
they can call you anything they
want have I told you the rules about
self-defense there are no rules of
self-defense there are laws if you break
a law you go to jail uh even if it's
self-defense if uh if you do something
that would kill you professionally well
there goes your job
but there's no there's no ethical or
moral limit on what you can do in
self-defense there are laws but no
ethical or moral limits so if you go on
television and somebody says you're a
Nazi and you respond by uh accusing them
of being a
terrorist all good all good that is
absolutely acceptable not true by the
way I I should remind you that there's
no evidence that medy Assan has any you
know connections that you should worry
about but yes you can say that he could
call him a petto if he
wanted again he'd probably get a sued if
he did that but there's no rules if
somebody calls you a Nazi on television
you can go you can
unload your entire verbal clip verbal
verbal yeah don't do anything physical
that's the rule I I think we just have
to agree on that there there are some
rules that if it's self-defense remember
it guski wasn't the one who started the
name calling if he had started it I'd
have a different opinion but if so if he
sitting there and he's invited on a show
and somebody wants to call him a Nazi on
a national TV show you can say anything
you want including calling somebody a
terrorist
absolutely he had it
coming but it's not true
and that ladies and
gentlemen is everything I had to say
today so I'm going to talk to the uh
people on the locals platform by the way
if you're not on locals you don't get to
see all of my
Comics um that are better than ever and
a lot of the political stuff that I
don't do on here and we do the evening
show to cure your
loneliness uh I can cure your loneliness
with the man
um live streams every
night so uh I'm going to say hi to them
and I'm going to say bye to YouTube and
Rumble and X thanks for joining we'll
see you tomorrow same time same
