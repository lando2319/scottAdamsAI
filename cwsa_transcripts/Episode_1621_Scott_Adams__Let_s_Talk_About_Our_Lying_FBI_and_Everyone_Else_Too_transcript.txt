good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that ever happened to you
in your whole darn life
it's called
coffee with scott adams
we did have a little uh difficulty here
with some equipment my one of my ipads
crapped out this morning
so holy that we got sound and everything
but it's all coming together today
now don't you think
this will be the best live stream you've
ever seen yeah i know we're all on the
same page on that but if you like to
take it up a notch
all you need is a
copper marker glass a tanker jealous
time to canteen jerry flowers vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
do you know how hard it is to
read and engineer and talk at the same
time
because that's what i'm trying to do
here
one more thing and we'll be good
so how many of you saw
senator cruz interview the fbi
representative
shelley was right
that's funny
all right
let's start with uh
some of my favorite stories
so apparently uh at least one country uh
has told their athletes when they're
going to the olympics that they can't
bring their laptops or their smartphones
to china i forget which country was it
netherlands or someplace
belgium i forget who it doesn't matter
the point is
is there anybody here who knows you you
can't bring your own or doesn't know
is there anybody here who doesn't know
that if you go to china on business you
can't bring your own laptop or your own
phone
how many of you know that that's a thing
or to russia yeah i imagine there are a
number of countries that would be
similar
but
when i talk to business people who go
there
they
some of them actually will shred
the laptop that they brought to china
so that nobody can use it
like not ever even accidentally you take
it back and you never open it again
after you leave china because they give
you a special one just to travel to
china
you literally put it in a giant
mechanical shredder
you don't even erase the data you shred
the whole device that's how bad it is
now
how would you like to be a spectator at
the olympics
you're just a spectator you're just
traveling there to
you know watch the olympics and you
can't bring your own laptop or your own
smartphone
have you been on vacation anywhere
without a laptop or a smartphone that's
your own
have you ever tried that
do you know what do you know what a
giant problem that would be to travel i
can't even imagine it
now i suppose you could have a burner
phone and some kind of internet access
but you wouldn't feel comfortable
putting your password in anything right
would you sign up for any kind of thing
that required a password if you were in
china
it doesn't matter what laptop you're
using
so i don't think that anybody should
ever try travel to a place where you
have to
shred your laptop when you go home
let me give you a travel tip
i'm not really a
big traveler
so i don't know the most about traveling
but i can give you this one travel tip
if you're planning on going to a
destination
which requires shredding your phone and
laptop when you get home
maybe don't
maybe put that a little bit lower on
your on your bucket list until you can
travel there without shredding your
phone
when you get home
it makes me wonder if the olympics are
really some kind of giant honeypot
where the real play here is for china to
get all their dna and their digital
access
imagine how many
how many uh
countries
china will have access to digitally
because i imagine a lot of people will
actually bring their own smartphone
there but china's gonna have access to
all of that if they want it i mean they
can get into everything i think
so
look out for that
i saw an article that in xxl magazine
and i don't know if this is real
can somebody confirm this
is
kanye west who i call yay
really gonna uh moving partly to russia
and he's gonna have a house there
is that real
i'm gonna treat it like it's real
kanye yeast somebody says if he boosts
russia he'd be he'll be kanye east
it's pretty funny
well i'm not positive it's true
but i can't imagine anything that would
be more annoying to his ex-wife than
moving to russia to live like an
oligarch
it's not my imagination is that the
everything uh yay does is more
interesting than everything everyone
everyone else does
because did you ever wake up in the
morning and say
what am i gonna do today
i don't know i think i'll
i don't know
i think i've moved to russia and live
like an oligarch
that's one of those things that i've
never even said to myself
when i consider all of the things i
could possibly do in this world
never once if i said huh
i could get a dasha in in russia and
live like an oligarch
that sounds pretty good
so anyway if it's true i hope it is but
it also is another
let's say foreshadowing
of the future of russia and the united
states as allies
i'll just keep saying it until it
happens it might take 20 years
but we will be allies with russia it's
going to happen it's just inevitable
it's a question of when
uh wondering what is your opinion on
flying thousands of people into china
for the olympics then dispersing them
back
to every corner of the world with a new
virus
i think the olympics is crazy
in the context of
of the pandemic is crazy
now as much as i think everybody should
have you know freedom to do what they
want and no mandates and all that
this is a
specific kind of an event which is
almost guaranteed to be a bad idea and a
pandemic
seems like it but maybe china is so good
at crushing the virus
that nobody will spread anything when
they're there maybe
well rasmussen has a poll about the
filibuster question
if you don't know in the uh
so in congress if you want to guess
something
past and the other side doesn't like it
even if you have a majority it's not
good enough you've got to have 60 or
else
the team that doesn't want you to win
can do a filibuster which basically is a
way to stall until
you can't get anything done
now what that does is it makes it hard
for the
even the majority to get anything done
so they only get things done that really
have a lot of support on both sides
so is it bad to get rid of a uh let's
say a safeguard in congress
that makes you really really have to get
some of the other side on board to get
something done
i would say that's a good idea
conceptually it's a good idea wouldn't
you say
you forget about the detail of what bill
you're talking about but conceptually
don't you like the fact that it's really
hard to get anything passed
because you have to get both sides on
board i mean it seems a pretty good idea
or at least some people on the other
team
and that's a very credible system in my
opinion well it turns out that because
the democrats have some specific things
they want to get past
and the filibuster would presumably
prevent that
they're trying to get that changed and
down to just a 50 majority would get
something done
and how many democrats favor getting rid
of one of the most important safeguards
in all of our republic
two-thirds
two-thirds of democrats want to get rid
of one of the most important safeguards
in the republic
because they want to get something done
have i ever mentioned that democrats
consistently fail to understand human
motivation
so it's the same problem
every time
it's never even a different problem
it's the same damn problem
they act like humans will not respond to
incentives and enticements
but of course
the very minute you make this uh
this rule go away the filibuster
will be about the same minute the
republicans take take charge of congress
so do they really have they not planned
ahead
to know that they would be giving up all
of their power
to get a few things in the short run
that the republicans would presumably
try to reverse they'd have to get a
president in there too
but i mean they only have a few years to
get done whatever they're doing and it's
going to get reversed
because the filibuster will be gone
so that when you see the uh incredible
consistency of the same mistake
i don't know why more people don't call
this out
you always have the same flaw with your
system democrats
a complete blindness to how human beings
act is weird um
all right let's talk about the uh you
all saw or i'll bet many of you saw
ted cruz
um grilling an fbi
some spokesperson or had i don't know
who it was but somebody uh at a high
level in the fbi was talking
uh on a zoom call
official i assume they're under oath
because they're talking to a
member of the senate
in that
context
and i want to see if we can go through
how to detect lies
you ready
so the question was to the fbi
and ted cruz asked in a whole bunch of
good lawyerly ways
was the fbi involved or any fbi
people in any way associated with the
fbi were any of them involved in
january 6 meaning undercover people in
the crowd
and of course ted cruz asked in a number
of ways you know to to get at it in
different angles
and uh the fbi
spokesperson uh declined jill jill
sanborn
said um
let me give you a direct question
did any fbi agents or confidential
informants actively participate in the
events of january 6
yes or no
ted cruz asked
fbi's jill sanborn answered
i can't answer that
now
is it fair for the fbi to say we can't
answer questions about you know sources
and methods
is that fair
do you do you agree that generally
speaking you know you don't want to
force your intelligence or your law
enforcement people to give up their
sources and methods in public
right i mean that seems fairly
safe
but didn't you ask yourself why she
can't just say no
if the answer was no
would you be giving up any sources and
methods
would you
if you had no involvement
what sources and methods would you be
giving up
now is there anybody in the united
states who doesn't understand
that the fbi and law enforcement
routinely
put their assets in organizations they
think they want to watch
we all know that so what what exactly
source and method would they be giving
up
if they said that ray epps or anybody
else
was working for them
what would that be giving up
that's the part everybody knows
that they have informants
and assets right
so
um
how would you take that answer what
would be your interpretation of i can't
answer that when the answer is a yes or
no question
somebody said she did answer it she did
answer it she said i can't answer that
later when he asked a more specific
question
um
let's see the more specific question was
was anybody associated with the fbi or
under their direction
involved in any of the viol no involved
in any illegal activity did you see that
question
so cruz asked if anybody at the fbi or
anybody that the fbi had you know worked
with
was involved in anything illegal
and what was their answer
not to my knowledge
not to my knowledge
doesn't that sort of indicate they might
have been there
and isn't that a very specific answer
because she could have said no we didn't
have anybody there
and then when asked about the the
violence she could have said i just told
you that we didn't have anybody there
all right so if she answered the other
question differently that would have
been easy
but
did anybody see ray epps do anything
illegal on video
because i'm not sure i did
did you
i saw him do things that looked sketchy
as hell
and if he were if he had been working
for the fbi
would any of that been illegal
i don't know i feel like a prosecutor
could probably find something but if the
fbi's spokesperson here jill sanborn if
she said something like not to my
knowledge
wouldn't she simply be saying i don't
know if what he did was a crime
that would be different from saying i
don't know what he did
you're just saying i don't know that
what he did is a crime
because i don't know i watched the video
and
did any
but his inciting
is inciting a riot if he's just telling
you to get close to the building or to
go inside
is that exactly illegal
so here's the question it might be
illegal
but was she lying if she said not to my
knowledge because she's never looked
into it
if she had never looked into it could
she say not to my knowledge
she could
that's that's a little bit overly
specific isn't it
because if she knew that no fbi people
were there
she could say for sure
no
there was nobody involved in the fbi or
in any way with anything illegal
but she said not to my knowledge
that's overly specific isn't it
let me give you a lie detection tip
the overly specific answer i'm going to
give you an example
let's say you suspected that your
your girlfriend boyfriend husband wife
let's say somebody said they were
spotted
at uh
you know some kind of restaurant or
something
and somebody gets back to you and you
say to your boyfriend girlfriend
you say
i heard that you were with x
at this restaurant
is that true
and what if the person you
question says this
as if i'd have time to take an uber to
that restaurant
that's an overly specific answer because
the question had nothing to do with an
uber
in fact
maybe the restaurant was next to work or
walking distance or maybe it was only
five minutes away
but
the the answering uh with a question
you know or or sarcasm as if i'd have
time to take an uber there that wasn't
even in the question
so
ted cruz's question wasn't do you have
knowledge
he asked did it happen
and she said i don't have knowledge of
it that's a little too specific isn't it
so i always look for the overly specific
answer
here's some other ways to tell a lie
the angry
accusation if you ask somebody if they
did something
did you take that last cookie
you
left the seat up on the toilet
what
what
what's that have to do with taking the
last cookie so if somebody angrily
accuses you of something unrelated
that's basically
you know a confession
you should take that way
so if you see the overly specific denial
that's a lie and the attacking you when
you simply ask a question that could
have been a yes or no question
and then there's also the half
confession
do you know what the half confession
looks like
did you murder bob i did not murder bob
well here's some evidence of you with
bob with a gun in your hand oh i was
definitely with bob with a gun in my
hand
but i didn't murder him
and then you say but the video i can see
you sh you're actually firing the weapon
in the direction of bob
i mean i could see it right on the video
and then the person said yeah yeah i had
a weapon and i fired it in the direction
of bob but i wasn't firing at bob
like that's crazy
so that's that's the
admitting
half of the the thing that's that's
always a
tell all right here's my provocative
question do you know what kind of people
the fbi employ
well lots of people but one of the kinds
of people
named
one of the kinds of people that the fbi
employ are
people who are good at detecting lies
people who are good at detecting lies
because they do that for a living
right there are fbi experts
who are good at interviewing people
just to see if they lied
how much would you like to hear an fbi
expert on lying
tell you if
jill sanborn was telling you the truth
wouldn't you like to hear an fbi
agent who is an expert at this
tell you if the fbi is lying to you
i would
i would
let's see let's see maybe if there's
somebody who's a producer who's watching
this it can't be hard to find that
person i think if you google
on youtube
you'll find an fbi
an ex well an ex-cia person i think but
i think you probably find an ex-fbi
person who is an expert of this just put
him on the show
say what do you think if if somebody
said this who was a
you know a perpetrator
a suspect would you believe
all right
let's make that happen uh as i've said
many times the default assumption from
your government is if they won't tell
you what you want to know you have to
assume that they're lying
assuming they're lying if they're not
transparent
the assumption of guilt has to be given
so
we would assume
we don't know
but the assumption is that that's a
confession that the fbi was involved in
january 6.
so personally i accept it as a
confession
that my worldview now
incorporates the fbi response as a
confession
anybody else
is there anybody else who who process
that as a confession
a few of you right i think some of you
agree with that
um
all right let's see what else is going
on here
um
do you know somebody named vox day
so
uh he's become my new mascot so he's
criticizing my record of predictions
and he went through my record of
predictions and said
where i said i got it right
and then he analyzed and said no you got
that totally wrong
and i'm thinking
reasons
no reasons you just got it totally wrong
what about the next one
i make my claim and he goes no you got
that one totally wrong
what
yeah and how weird that his name sounds
like vax
but anyway there's uh there's this weird
situation i've told you about which is
the people who got everything wrong
because they're not good at analyzing
things
when it's all said and done and we
actually learned what was true and what
wasn't about the pandemic you know did
the vaccinations help us or hurt us and
all that other stuff once we know it
the people who were not smart enough to
analyze it in the first place
will also be not smart enough to know if
they were right
when it was done
which is really annoying
the people who got everything wrong
are going to be positive they got
everything right because the same lack
of understanding of how anything works
would go in their original prediction
as well as their analysis of how it
turned out
they don't become smarter toward the end
of the process
and let me let me just give you this one
example from fox day
so he says that i made the wrong
decision by uh taking the vaccination
that i definitely
no doubt about it made the wrong
decision by getting vaccinated what
would you say
would you would you say that was could
you could you score that as wrong
like you're sure of it it's wrong
see some yeses
okay
uh well none of his business but i say
it publicly so it is his business in a
way
because you did so some people say i
made a mistake
now let me ask you this
was it was the vaccination a yes no
question
was it yes no
because the only way it could be a yes
no meaning it's definitely a bad
decision or it's definitely not
the only way it could be definitely yes
or no
is if you knew a lot more about the
vaccination right so if you knew the
future
you would know
if it was a bad idea
but if you only know the present
do you know that
because in my world view people who got
vaccinated are protected from the more
the more uh let's say the worst outcomes
does anybody disagree with that
is anybody saying you see any news that
would disagree with the fact
that vaccinated people are dying less
they're still getting infected just as
much but they're dying less and by a lot
that's still true right
i mean i believe that's universally
considered true
so
how could somebody say that i made the
wrong decision with our current
information
is it possible i made the wrong decision
well it's possible
i chose wrong
but it's probably not possible i made
the wrong decision
do you see the difference
it's definitely possible that i chose
wrong
it's not
it's not reasonable to say that i
decided wrong
because the decision is without
information
so whichever way i went vaccinated or
not vaccinated it would have been
without information
because there was no option of having
information about the future
i only had information about the past
that i didn't totally trust
and the present that i didn't totally
trust
but i didn't have any information about
the future
you know is long-haul covered worse than
you know long-haul getting vaccinated i
don't know
nobody knows
and so
if somebody is positive that the
decision was right or wrong that would
be somebody who's just bad at analysis
would you agree with me with this point
if somebody said i think you made the
wrong decision
that's a reasonable opinion
i think you made the wrong decision
completely reasonable
you totally made the wrong decision
guaranteed is that reasonable
given that i didn't have information
either way
no way to know either way
so i would say that it was a risk
management decision that was really
closer to a guess
now what kind of background would one
have to have
to think that in a situation where the
information is not available and you are
just guessing that you made the wrong
decision
what kind of background would you have
to have
you'd have to be an artist
i wonder if vox day is an economist or
more of a
writer
of science fiction
yeah he's an artist
so when you get criticized by artists
the
correct
response is hashtag artist
because the moment you start dealing
with it like you're having a irrational
conversation
you almost
immediately realize you're not
that you're not
if i've i've said this before if i have
a disagreement with somebody who's a
trained economist
here's how the conversation goes i
believe x now i believe y
why do you believe x or y well here are
my assumptions
oh well one of those assumptions i don't
agree with where's your data oh here's
my data oh i don't think that is
reliable enough well i think it might be
and then you know exactly where the
difference is usually a difference in
assumption
right not a difference in analysis
because two people who are trained
economists
would probably analyze things similarly
meaning they would do it correctly they
would know what to compare and what not
to compare
but an artist
an artist is just going to be like
i'm pretty sure i'm totally right
can somebody tell me when it's
15 minutes before the hour i don't seem
to have a clock here
oh yeah i do okay
all right couple more things
um there will be approximately 12 000
athletes in the beijing
olympics the omicron olympics
place your bets
12 000 completely vaccinated
athletes
now i don't know how many of them are
boosted
but we would assume that they're all
double vaccinated would you say
fair to say
fair to say all 12 000 athletes will be
vaccinated
at least probably at least two shots
right
on the same page
based on your belief
of how dangerous or not
the vaccinations are
how many people do you expect to die
during the olympics and of 12 000
vaccinated athletes
12 000 vaccinated athletes
would you change your mind about the
safety of vaccinations if zero people
have a heart problem during the olympics
just i just want you to commit
would you commit
that 12 000 vaccinated people
uh working as hard as they can you know
during the competition and training for
it
would you agree
that if zero of them die you would at
least question how dangerous it is
no that wouldn't make you question
12 000 is quite a quite a few people
yeah
if the vaccinations
were safe enough
that fewer than one in 12 000 had a
problem
would you consider that dangerous
suppose one
why why not so i'm saying most people
say no
but give me a why not
comments are going by pretty fast
are you saying it's because it wouldn't
be statistically significant there are
12 000 vaccinated people
remember now here's the context here's
the context it is widely reported
although i believe not true
this is my personal opinion not based on
facts my personal opinion is it's not
true
that high high-end athletes are dying on
the field
in europe and other places
because a lot of people who say that the
vaccination is dangerous i think i think
dr malone said this as well
that if you look at the uh the high
number of high-end athletes who are
dying
just like falling dead on the field
that there can be no other explanation
than the vaccinations people say
now other people say well if you google
this you'll find out this has been
happening since 2018.
so that the high number of people
inexplicably dying while competing
has been happening since 2018 two years
before the pandemic
it is it is something's happening
there's definitely something happened
but it was before the pandemic
now how many nba players have died
after getting vaccinated
how many nfl players have died after
getting vaccinated now
the total number of nba players isn't
that much right
but also the total number of
professional soccer players in europe
isn't that much
when you say what would be the total
number of professional
soccer players in europe
five thousand
would you say five thousand maybe
just guess it
so if maybe out of five thousand
athletes you believe i don't believe
this is happening but if you believe
that out of 5 000 you could tell that
there's a problem because enough of them
are dropping dead
then wouldn't you expect that 12 000 top
athletes all vaccinated
somebody would drop dead wouldn't they
no
no i'm not saying that you can prove it
i'm gonna put my prediction out there
my prediction is that there will be uh
zero um confirmed
vaccination
um illnesses that happened during
competition
now
can i make a commitment to you
let's reverse this let's put the
pressure on me
right i was putting the pressure on you
to make a commitment let's reverse that
let's put it on me
if
if two people
who are competing in the olympics
have some kind of a heart or
you know something that makes them pass
out
no not just passing out let's say it's a
confirmed like real problem they didn't
just pass out a real problem like a
heart problem if there are two of them
during the olympics
and we learned that that's unusual
i would i would need to know what past
olympics have been like if two people
have a heart issue or something that
seems coronavirus related or no vaccine
related if two of them have a
vaccine-looking problem
i will change my opinion
fair
i will only take two examples and again
this is not science of course right it's
not a randomized controlled trial but in
terms of my opinion
two
two incidents during the olympics
would make me say holy we've got a
problem here is that fair
now i'm not saying that two would
confirm it and i'm not saying that zero
would confirm there's no problem
can we get on the same page there
none of this would confirm anything
but if you're looking for you know
strong signposts
i'd say two problems would convince me
that there might be something there
zero problems should at least at least
nudge you in the other direction
it doesn't have to put you all the way
there but nudge you
all right
um i saw a comment uh from user astro
bot jones on
twitter
he said that in 2010 and of course this
is long before the pandemic he had a
really rough flu you know just your
ordinary seasonal flu but sometimes you
get really bad ones he said although the
symptoms the symptoms went away after a
few bad days
he said he looked awful for two weeks
felt it for months
with weakness malaise and fatigue
for months
and he believes that it aged him by a
few years
in 2014 there were 8 million
professional soccer players in europe
really
8 million professional soccer players in
europe
i think that certainly questions what
professional means
whatever the top league is i doubt i
mean
and i guess i guess i'd question that
that statistic but if that's true that
is an important statistic to put in the
mix
all right so here's my point
um i believe i've had the same
experience
how many of you have had the experience
of just having a bad regular flu
like one that just kicked your ass
and and you didn't feel good for months
if anybody
i feel like i've had that experience
yeah a lot of people are saying yes
so when you're you're looking at
long-haul covent
uh the thing the economist would tell
you to look at
is not compare it to how you feel when
you feel good
so if you're trying to decide if you
have long-haul covet
don't say how do i feel today a month
after the the covet
versus feeling great
don't do that that's the wrong
comparison
compare how you would feel after a
regular flu that happened to be just bad
compared to a month after the covet
and if both cases you know often you
feel like you're still getting your ass
kicked
then maybe it's just the flu
right now it doesn't prove anything i'm
just giving you a little extra context
i'm still concerned that long-haul covet
could be a thing but also concerned that
long-haul getting vaccinated could be a
problem we don't know
here's something that was revealing
adam kinzinger i guess he's part of this
january 6 committee
and when asked if they will have enough
to you know have some kind of a finding
he answers that question in a very
unusual way
he said that they will have
a
they believe they will soon have a quote
powerful and substantive narrative
narrative
narrative
wait what
um
and then he went on to say that even
though they didn't have everything maybe
you could have they have a lot so he
says i think if everything shut down
today
we'd be able to put out a powerful and
substantive narrative
we still have more information obviously
we want to get get yet
now who uses the word narrative in that
context
now i do understand it's a it's a
correct use of the english language
i do understand that if he has no
political intentions whatsoever the word
works right it is actually
a correct word
to describe somebody who could put
together a story
a story
with all the facts that they know that
would give you a good idea of what was
happening
i guess you could call that a narrative
right
but don't we almost always use that word
to mean
don't we
when was the last time you heard
narrative
without knowing that the context meant
i'm i don't think i've ever used i i've
never heard a narrative used outside of
the context of obvious
have you
i mean seriously have you ever heard the
word used in any other context other
than
i feel like adam kinsenger
just admitted that the entire process is
can i get my fbi lie detector guy hey
got some more work for you get over here
fbi lie detector
what does it mean when somebody says
that their own story is a narrative
it only means one thing
am i wrong
what is the second possible
interpretation of that
did you become aware in 2017 aware of
what
um
oh yes when i asked for an explanation
in narrative form but not in politics
right yeah if you're doing a writing
class yes you might ask for a narrative
in written form
but if you're talking about politics it
only has one there's only one definition
politically
all right well uh i've been trying to
ignore this uh novak djokovic story you
know the number one tennis player trying
to get into compete in the australian
open
but
they wouldn't let him in because he's
not vaccinated and then he said
that he wanted to get in because he'd
been previously infected
and then that almost worked but then we
find out that after he was infected he
gave an interview
with a guy and didn't tell him he was
infected
so he had a deep like a long interview
with a reporter
after knowing he was positive
and didn't tell the reporter
so novak djokovic managed to go from
one of the most popular athletes in the
world people really like him in the
tennis world if you don't follow tennis
he's really popular
and he just turned into
just an basically
now
we have to reserve judgment he might
have a reason for whatever he did it
would be good to hear his side of the
story but in terms of what's happening
to his reputation
wow this is a bad week
uh
that's a really bad week
too bad about that
uh there was an abstract
meaning nothing like a confirmed trial
or anything in which some folks put some
uh looks like some
marijuana
cannabinoid acids from hemp
to see if it would uh
defeat covet
now i'd like to read exactly how they
explained it
because i know a lot of you
like to get tips on writing
so i'm going to show you how well
written this was
really easy to
understand usually when you hear science
stuff you might say to yourself well i'm
not a scientist and some of these words
i don't understand but here's some good
clean scientific writing in this
abstract
it says
affinity selection mass spec
spectrometry was used for the discovery
of botanical ligands to the soros cove
to spike protein
you're with me so far uh cannabinoid
acids from hemp cannabis sativa were
found to be aloe
steric as well as orthosteric ligands
so this is important the the ligands
were both allosteric and orthosteric
because sometimes when your ligands are
just
just one or the other that's those are
like bad ligands
but these are like good ligands they're
both allosteric and orthosteric and
that's good
with uh oh this is even better they have
a micro molar affinity for the spike
protein
micro molar affinity
yeah a lot of your uh
a lot of your compounds won't have any
micro molar affinity
for anything but this is good stuff
and uh
then more
in the follow-up uh assays so they were
just doing this in test tubes not in
people essentially the
cannabilic acid and
cannabidiolic acid prevented infection
of human epithelial cells by pseudovirus
expressing the sars cov2 spike protein
and preventing entry
into the cells importantly
okay science
sciencey stuff
um
so this could explain why i've not yet
been infected uh
do you know how many uh
potentially
useful covid treatments i'm on right now
so i'm already on a prescription
pepsid anti-acid
which is suspected to be one of the
things that helps
with covet
i'm also on uh budesonide which is a
just a normal
asthma inhaler that you use every day
just to keep you from getting asthma
that also is indicated
as useful for it and now marijuana the
thing i have i have more marijuana in my
system than blood
so
if you if you figure out my good bmi
so so my bmi is good
and i'm full of chemicals that
automatically fight covet
i know i think i'm pretty good i think
i'm pretty good
looking good
well although our fbi can't be trusted
and all of our other systems are broken
thank god our election systems are
completely credible
thank god
oh oh i've got a challenge here i'm
sorry no no way
pk 83 i don't want to have to block you
for this but this is the most
objectionable comment i've ever seen
and
hold on to your hat this is what he says
he says i smoke 10 times more weed than
you scott
i don't know if i can take that kind of
insult
i might have to block you
no i'm going to let you go i'm going to
let you go
you get a pass
but that's a provocative statement
all right uh
rasmussen did another poll and they uh
asked would you be more or less likely
to vote for a candidate who would
advocate reducing uh prison time
for uh
criminals
what the hell
can somebody tell me what time it is
oh i think i have to go in a minute last
story
um
would you be more or less likely to vote
for somebody who wants to get rid of
jail time uh 18 said they'd be more
likely to vote for somebody who was
reducing jail crime for serious crimes
18
7 said they weren't sure so they weren't
necessarily against letting criminals
out of jail
to commit more crimes
so they see so 18 thought
they'd be more likely to vote for the
person who
was in favor of more crime
and seven percent weren't opposed to it
so let's see
18 plus seven
eighteen plus seven is uh
seven
twenty-five
so twenty-five percent of the people
surveyed surprisingly
surprisingly
were not too
unhappy about extra crime
so
you got that
i saw a
tweet about how many people in congress
had traded and made a whole bunch of
money and beat the market average
and the implication is the implication
is that they did something sketchy
because it looks like insider trading
because their trading success was way
too good
and the list had about 30 people who
beat the s p 500
which would be a sign of good investing
so out of congress how many people in
congress
435
how many people are in congress
430 what's the number
i'm bad with my
politics
all right well
um
so there were about you know 30 some
that beat the average but about 10 of
them only beat the average by a little
bit
so that doesn't mean much right because
people are all over the average some
below some above so if you throw away
the people who beat it by only a little
bit and only look at the people who
killed it like really made a lot of
money
they're about 20 of them okay there's
438
somebody say
or 430
oh and we're counting both
i don't know if they were counting
senate too i guess they were 538 if you
count the senate okay so let's say out
of 538 they founded 20 people who really
really invested well or lucky but they
had really big returns
do you think you should be alarmed if 20
people out of
538 had a really good investing year
yes or no
that's exactly what you'd expect
you would exactly expect something like
20 people would kill would kill the
market
and probably 20 people lost a bunch of
money
it's the most expected thing you could
possibly see now apparently the timing
of some of the trades was suspect
completely different question
if the timing of the trades is suspect
you have to look at that right that that
means something but the fact that 20
people out of 538 had a really good year
and like really good
one of them is uh
um
well it doesn't matter who but one of
them had a pretty big return and it
could have been one company
like if somebody bought apple computer
three years ago
they killed the s p 500 didn't they
just just buying apple computer
the simply the most ordinary thing you
do if if any of them invested in tesla
but maybe had three stocks
so you bought three stocks one of them
was tesla
you would have killed the market
it wouldn't mean anything it just meant
you bought what a lot of people bought
tesla
all right that's all i got i gotta run
see you tomorrow
