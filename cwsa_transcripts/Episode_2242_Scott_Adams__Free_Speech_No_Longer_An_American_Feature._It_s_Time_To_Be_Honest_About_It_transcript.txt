foreign
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
again it's called coffee with Scott
Evans and once again it features a
whiteboard yeah best thing you've ever
seen if you'd like this experience to
reach levels that people have only
accomplished with
illegal drugs all you need is a cup of
Margaret glass of tanker jealous and a
canteen Jager flask a vessel levitic
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure dopamine it is the
day the thing makes everything better
it's called disciple except
it happens now go
oh yeah
that's good that's good
have you ever noticed that it's easier
to
pay attention to bad news and good news
you know good news
you just take it for granted and I
realized this summer in Northern
California
this was the best weather of Summer I
have ever experienced
and a year of my life
the best weather it was like room
temperature just about every day it was
just perfect
Southern California had a little bit of
a
tropical storm which was unusual but
didn't have much effect up where I am
and believe it or not California's
forest fires
are actually at the second year in a row
that they're low
at the moment
the the weather where I am is Smokey
so you can't really see the hills are
full of smoke but it's way less than it
normally is this time of year right now
it would just be a mess normally but
apparently California did either figure
out how to do a better job on the fires
because they did make some changes
um some of it might have been the
weather itself but they added 24
aircraft
that they lease during Fire season so
they can respond faster put things out
faster and they've nearly doubled the
acreage
deprived of fuel by doing
some Burns so they did some controlled
Burns they've got a bunch of aircraft to
respond quickly and apparently it worked
it seems like it's on the way
um so I asked I asked on the
on the x-platform I did a little uh
survey and I wondered if other people
are having worse or better weather
now what what should the answer be
you would expect that a good number of
people would be having worse than normal
weather wouldn't you
well I don't know if it's a function of
the people who answer my polls it's a
unscientific poll but I gave them a
choice of as you weather this summer I
just limited it to the summer we just
had so you'd remember it easily
I said is it better worse or average
32 percent said this summer was better
than average
23 percent
almost a quarter said it was worse than
average
just a coincidence and 46 said it's
about the same
so it's it's really hard to sell a
climate crisis
when three quarters of the human beings
who live in the country
roughly speaking you know it's an
unscientific poll but directionally it's
probably true three quarters of us can't
really tell that anything has changed
or if it has changed maybe it got a
little better recently
how in the world are you supposed to
believe that climate change is real
if three quarters of us are having a
physical sensation
that is not
now I get that you wouldn't necessarily
feel it so I'm not trying to sell you
that oh my town had a good weather so
there's no climate change I'm not saying
that and I know that if anybody from a
major publication is watching they're
already writing that down oh canceled
cartoonist says climate change isn't
real because his weather was good oh oh
you know that's coming right
but that's not what I'm saying I'm
saying persuasion wise not
scientifically
persuasion wise how are you going to
convince the country that there's an
emergency when they walk outside they
just don't feel it
they literally don't feel it
so my comments about persuasion not
about science I know you can't tell
climate change by checking the weather I
do know that I do know that
but I also tell you that one of the BS
filters I use
it's a pretty good one
is when the science does not match your
observation
you should ask more questions
doesn't mean the science is wrong
but if it doesn't match your everyday
experience
that's when you ask questions I always
use this example
science says that smoking tobacco
could give you lung cancer
and indeed almost everybody I know who
has ever had lung cancer with one
exception was a smoker
so observation
science perfect good match
but climate change
so far not a match I walk outside and
every day of my life has been either
similar or hey that's a nice day
no no observable change doesn't mean
climate change is not a risk
yeah I'm just saying that if I can't
observe it and feel it it's a tough sell
so ask more questions
there's a study of when people are
happiest and I thought this was a waste
of studying
so it turns out that children are happy
up until about the age of nine
then between 9 and 16 they get a little
less happy
but then their happiness increases
slightly up till the age of about 70.
and then after 70 their enjoyment of
Life Starts decreasing until
till the end
did anybody need to study that
did did you not know that children are
happier than teenagers is there anybody
who didn't know
the young kids are happier than
teenagers
and
I'm pretty sure that you know between 9
and 16
it's not exactly a teenage
but is when you start seeing what older
people can do and that you're not
allowed to do and you start wishing you
were like these older people so of
course it makes perfect sense to your
you're a little less happy when you're
not quite little
but you're not big enough to do anything
that you want to do that's terrible time
that makes sense but also is it a
surprise
that when people reach their
reproductive ages they have the most
satisfaction
I feel like that's built into us I think
we're designed by evolution
to be happiest when we're in a
reproductively you know possible stage
and that it makes sense that people uh
stay happy once they're established
until they're 70 and they become
unhealthy
my plan is to become unhappy after 72.
that was always my plan I'm going to
stay happy until the age of seven
right off a cliff
but that's just my plan
all right
all right this is the funniest thing of
the day
so a user on X called barred vocal
uh tweeted this question for men
my mom who has been married to my dad
for over 30 years just found out that my
dad constantly scans for assesses and
plans for possible threats
and then borrowed vopal asks us men folk
do all of you do this
yes
yes I think we all do I can speak for
myself
but
I have a continuous uh recording of
non-stop violence that runs in my head
and when you tell women that it just
blows them away
and they they say stuff like but not all
the time right
and I say yeah all the time
you mean just like sitting here in your
own house
yes
yes you mean like if you're in bed
yes
yes
I am definitely thinking about how I
will overcome The Intruders in bed
all the time
does it ever shut off I hope not I don't
want it to shut off it seems pretty
basic to my survival
you know maybe maybe it's a little over
attenuated for modern living but maybe
it isn't
maybe it's just maybe it's just right
and I don't think women understand the
degree to which
they don't need to worry about it
because we are
so if you if you wanted to appreciate
that this would be a good time to do it
but yes we continually think about the
threats because we know it's us
right if you're if you're a guy
and you're with let's say your family
and trouble arises
you stand up automatically because you
know it's your job right you're not
looking at the kids kids looks like
there's danger go take care of that
spouse go take care of that no you just
get up and take care of business
because that's just how we're designed
but uh let's add this to the question
about thinking about ancient Rome
so the past month women have learned the
following about men
they learned that we think about ancient
Rome way too much I know it's not every
one of the men but a lot of us I do
and that we scan and look for threats
100 of the time
and the funniest comment on this was
from Adam dopamine on on x
who who tweets first the Roman Empire
now this what changed to make women
notice men for the first time
that's right
women started wondering about men and
they got curious what we're thinking
first time
I'll tell you my experience does not
include women asking me how I think and
how I feel
that's not like a big part of my
experience
what are your private thoughts Scott
nobody's ever asked
I'm glad you asked nobody's ever asked
before
so yeah women are finding out who men
are for the first time
they may have picked a bad time in
history to ask that question but
figuring it down now
all right
um would you like the next surprise for
women I'd like to offer the next
surprise for women
and by the way I don't know if this
one's Universal or not
but ever since I was very little
I've spent a great deal of my waking
time
wondering how to blow the out of
everything I say
if I see a car
I wonder how much
C4 it would take to blow it up
I see
if I see a mountain
I'm thinking huh
there's a theoretical amount of dynamite
that would take that mountain away
everything I see I wonder how I can blow
it up
I've watched the men laughing because
that's one of your secret thoughts right
you don't want to tell anybody how often
do you think about blowing up we
think about it all the time
yeah when you were a teenager and you
got some firecrackers you know that
maybe your parents didn't know you had
you got some good firecrackers what was
your first thought was your first
thought I could use these firecrackers
to make a loud noise
is that your first thought no your first
thought was how can I catch a frog and
attach it to the Frog and see what
happens because you're
yeah young boys I cannot defend them I
do not defend them and I don't want you
to blow up any frogs frogs are nice
but no we're terrible we're terrible we
just want to blow stuff up
all the time
so aren't you glad you found that out
there's a little secret for you for the
lady Folk
all right
so General Millie is retiring and this
gives people the opportunity to say
terrible things about people
about Trump mostly hey here's an excuse
to say something bad about Trump General
Mill is retiring now I gotta say that
there are very few people in public life
that look incompetent you just look at
them and you say what is wrong with you
you look incompetent and I don't say
that about people who simply disagree
with me
for example when Eric swalwell
says things that make my head explode I
don't think to myself oh he looks
incompetent
he just looks like somebody who's
pushing a point of view for a reason
and that's all it is when Adam Schiff
stands in front of the camera and says
things are clearly untrue
I don't think to myself wow that guy's
incompetent
I think he's just lying he's probably
good at lying
but when I saw General milley talk
the whole time I think to myself is he
dumb
you feel it looks dumb
everything he says just feels a little
dumb
and I was trying to think is there
anybody else like that in who has a high
level job and I'm going to give you two
names
that you do not think are just lying
Jerry Nadler
Jerry Nadler
kableris you're way ahead of me you had
that on the locals platform they were
just grieving both of those names before
I said I swear to God I was going to say
both of those names
but that should tell you something
that you guessed the names I was going
to say out of you know the Thousand or
so public figures that you could name
and you guessed them completely yeah
Nadler does not look like he's just
lying
he looks like his brain doesn't really
work
now I'm not going to throw fettermen on
there because I don't know what's going
on with him
he he presents himself like his brain is
not working but it's possible it is on
the inside I don't really know hard to
know
so yeah I mean there those are three
that I put in the same category
uh General Millie Nadler and Kamal
Harris
well Amazon is making a four billion
dollar investment and it's only a
minority stake in a company called
anthropic which is an AI company
so I didn't realize that Amazon wasn't
already super heavily into Ai and I I
think they probably were
but maybe they thought they needed a
little jump start here so they bought a
steak in this company
and this raises the following question
if you were
uh let's say wanted to know everything
about Americans and you wanted to like
really get into their business
a lot of database would do it the best
if you had their banking information
you certainly know a lot about people
because every purchase you make you know
might go through a credit card or
something but our banking information is
distributed across all the different
banks and credit cards and you know you
could find it you can find everything
about me but you'd have to go to a bunch
of different entities to to figure out
what I'm doing
but if you had my Amazon history
you've got me
you know everything about me
I you know you could tell by the types
of things I buy
a lot about my personality and certainly
a lot about my situation I'll bet you
could tell my political preference
you you could know my gender political
preference you'd probably know my sexual
preference you would certainly know my
IQ
you just look at what books I buy what
products I buy you would know my income
because if I buy a little bit more than
other people and more expensive Stuff
Etc and I'm trying to think there's
almost nothing about me that you
wouldn't know about my
by my lifetime of Amazon purchases
and just about everybody's buying from
Amazon
so I would say that the Amazon database
and I want to see if you would if you
have something that would top it I think
the Amazon database would be the
number one most
um
accurate set of information about an
individual
is there anything that would have more
will you say Facebook
but Facebook is still only
20 percent of the country
how many people are on Facebook
I guess a lot of people have it but we
don't all use it
yeah well okay I'll give you Facebook
and of course the NSA has data and
everything
yeah Facebook Maybe
Google Google might
Apple might
but Amazon certainly has I would say
among the best
um
all right let's talk about the shutdown
so the government is doing one of these
dumb
uh shut down playing chicken thing to
see if they can blame the other side
and Matt Gates is uh
I would say he's the noisiest person on
this topic in a productive way
and apparently he had a deal with
speaker McCarthy that they would vote on
bills in individually and not lump them
together as one thing because if you
lump them together is one thing you can
get away with a bunch of BS that you're
stuck in there because somebody has a
special interest
and I guess McCarthy agreed and then he
went back on it so according to the Matt
Gates version of things McCarthy made a
commitment and then backed out
and because of that Matt gase is going
to shut the whole government
down
totally on board with that
yeah shut the whole government down
crash it just crash the system if the
government can't do that simple thing
which is make a promise and then keep it
in this case I'm talking about McCarthy
does he have a reason for what he's
doing does McCarthy ever reason for
wanting to do it the way he did of
course yeah of course he has reason is
it a good reason
probably
a good reason
do I care nope nope no he made a promise
and I also think it's a good idea to
vote on bills independently
and he's got to do it
and if he doesn't do it shut the
government
absolutely on board yet you can't have a
country
of people who don't do what they say
they're going to do
yeah this seems like one of the smallest
problems in the world but I would argue
that the United States has been a
superpower
for you know a number of reasons we had
some natural geographic advantages and
stuff so kept us on some Wars but I
think the biggest thing about America
is that generally speaking we do what we
said we would do
plenty of people don't
but in the business world and it should
be true in the political world more than
it is you have to depend on people to do
what they said they would do if you take
that away literally nothing works the
whole the whole system falls apart
so McCarthy
the fact that he said he would do it
and we can see good reasons for doing it
he might also have some good reasons for
not doing it but I think that would be
less important I think the fact that he
said he was going to do it has got to
rule that's got to be the winning the
winning thing
now
um
somebody says she's a democrat in
Disguise I don't think so does anybody
even know his reason for not wanting to
break up the bills
was there some kind of negotiation that
he's trying to hide
globalism yeah that's too simple I I
don't think he's a globalist
pork you think he's hiding the pork
oh Ukraine is it about Ukraine getting
Ukraine oh is that what it was you
wanted to get Ukraine funded and the
best way to do it was to put it with the
other stuff that they want
is that the answer well that's not a
good answer
if that's the answer there's no answer
so Matt Gates has to witness
so I'm I'm all in on Matt Gates on
on having separate bills to vote on
all right we'll see if he wins on that
um but I would point out that Matt Gates
is doing what uh
DeSantis used to do
which is continually picking good little
fights that you know the fights that
might not be the most important thing in
the world but he's picking fights
strategically to Define who he is
how much fight he's willing to bring to
a game very important and to take it you
know take a let's say uh
stand on principle
as long as he's not crazy about it I
like it and he's not crazy
all right
I saw a
Elon Musk did a post he said the
absurdity of reality is making parody
almost impossible
have you heard anybody else say that
before the parody and reality emerged
so
it gets a lot more attention when he
says it
yeah I'm not the only person who ever
said it but I'm somewhat known for
saying that a lot
all right so I agree all right you're
following that story about the uh the
Nazi who was honored with a standing
ovation in Canada
so Canada gave a Nazi a standing ovation
because while he was a Nazi he fought
the Russians
so since he fought the Russians
he he's a good guy
even though he was a Nazi when he did it
so
now I've heard a lot of people
interacting about it let me give you my
overall opinion
all right I'll talk about a few of the
details My overall opinion of that is
it's completely meaningless
I don't care
it's it's literally a nothing it's a 96
year old guy
and the people who stood up didn't know
the details they just thought he'd
fought for Ukraine or something I guess
he was on the Ukraine side but a Nazi
and
so it means nothing that people clapped
for him okay we all agree on that it
means nothing that he got a standing
ovation because the people standing had
no idea what they were clapping for they
were just they thought they were being
polite or something
so the fact that is nothing now what
about the fact that there was somebody
in charge
who decided that they would clap for him
well it looks like just a mistake
yeah it doesn't mean anything that that
whole thing just looks like a up I
I wouldn't put any any meaning on it or
importance
uh
especially at that guy's age
all right
Wall Street journalist has article about
the talent shortage we're going to have
and I've talked about it as a
incompetence crisis
so and you've all noticed right you
can't get even simple things done
anymore just even routine things you
could go to a business whose only job it
is to sell you lollipops
it's the lollipop store
and you'd walk in with your credit card
and you'd say I'd like to buy a lollipop
in the old days you could buy a lollipop
and pay for it leave with your lollipop
in the modern world
your employee won't know how to sell
lollipops
and you're walking and you say can I
have a lollipop they'll say ooh
a lollipop I don't I don't really know
how to sell a lollipop
and then you look at the store side
you're like I'm sure this is the
lollipop store and you're you work here
right you're the only employee of the
lollipop store yeah yeah it's just me
here today
but you don't know how to sell a
lollipop
that that's every transaction I have now
is people in the job who don't have a
clue how to do the job they're in and
they'll just tell you that directly
here's another sign of incompetence that
makes me crazy
I'd like to do my impression
of renting a car
okay
go online and then it asks me every
question about renting a car my name my
address my credit card how long I'll
keep it you know what the features I
want what kind of car a hundred percent
of everything that can be known about me
I do online
and then I go to the rental store to
actually get my car
and then they just hand me the key and I
drive away right
no no
no nope no let me let me do the
impression of the guy behind the counter
after he has a hundred percent of my
information
it's the best reason
for having a smartphone
have you ever gone to do anything
without your smartphone have you ever
tried to buy a new phone at the phone
store
the phone store already knows everything
about you
and the phone store
sits there and it's a good thing you
already have a phone
so this is me when I go for any kind of
service okay this is what I'd like okay
you're going to be doing something that
makes no sense whatsoever to me and it's
going to take you a long time but I
brought my phone
Church
I mean my God
has anybody tried to buy a car
uh well uh your your offer is uh low but
I'm willing to take it to my manager
yeah everything's broken
anyway
now part of that is because the Boomers
were well trained but they're all aging
out
um and
Wall Street Journal points out that
economies move with the number of new
workers
and that's a scary thing
because their their basic point is that
throughout history
the health of your economy depended it
was almost completely dependent on the
flow of new workers
because they can always find at least in
a free free market they could always
find something to do
so if you have lots of workers you've
got a good economy if you have a worker
shortage well things are going to be
slower
so we have ways to compensate for that
in the modern world but yeah they're
imperfect
so
given that our demographic bubble
suggests that there will not be enough
workers to fill the jobs that we already
have and it's getting worse
are we going to solve that with
immigration
some of it
some of it will be solved with
immigration but of course they're coming
in with language issues in many cases
not trained in many cases
but what about robots
if it's true that Tesla is going to have
a robot that costs about the same as a
car
oh
they're going to do and they can train
them to do anything just by showing them
the robot just has to watch video of any
task and it learns it by watching the
video like E.T
I feel like robots are going to be the
answer for all the competence problem
I feel that if I could have talked to AI
about any of my situations including
buying a lollipop
I want to come out much better I think
the AI could have solved most of my
problems but the person can't even
understand them
so the Adam's law of slow-moving
disasters it says this
under normal situations the demographic
bomb that's happening in the United
States would be horrible
but it looks like the atoms love slow
living disasters is working again I
think we'll crank up our immigration
maybe improve it so it gets us more
skilled people but I think we'll crank
up our immigration and I think we'll
crank up our robots
and we'll have better ways to retrain
people and relocate them and we'll
probably be fine
that's that's my theory my theory is
we'll probably be fine
we'll just work we'll figure a way
around it
all right
um
uh I'm going to call it I'm going to
call the game
uh free speech is no longer a feature of
America now I know some of you can say
Scott what took you so long we've known
you for so long I know
I know it's just at some point you have
to call it
you know as some you know there was a
long period where Free Speech was
threatened
and that it was more threatened and more
threatened
but when you look at the cancellations
that are happening and you can see that
this is apparently
intelligence related that apparently
there's some large op to completely
suppress free speech and apparently
they're successful because the the
cancellations have worked
um and it's a weird kind of cancellation
because people like me are canceled only
to the degree
that I'm limited to talking to the
people who already agree with me
I can't reach anybody else
do you know the last time I had any kind
of interaction with a Democrat
I don't even remember
I actually can't even remember any
interaction with the Democrat
it used to be all the time now when I
get interaction from somebody who you
know pretends to be Democrat they're
just trolls
they're they're people who actually just
came over to make trouble they're not
people who would naturally see my
content and respond to it
so the ability of the bad guys whoever
they are to wall us off and keep us in
our own little walled area
is the end of free speech
because Free Speech doesn't have any
meaning if you don't have a tool to do
it and if you did do it nobody would see
it
so and and then also the government has
near complete ability to brainwash and
it's legal
it's legal in America for the CIA to
brainwash the public of America
for barely any any reason they want
and
does anybody disagree with my statement
that I I feel
I feel like a idiot
when I say that we have a First
Amendment right
it used to be something I was proud of
and I was fighting for it but let's just
be honest we don't have freedom of
speech
and nobody who's a Democrat will hear me
say this
am I right
do you know who will hear me oh maybe
Russell Brand will hear me maybe Tucker
Carlson will hear me
because they're canceled too
so I can talk to my fellow canceled
people and future canceled people but
we're in our little little uh Free
Speech Gulag and Free Speech I would be
offended to hear anybody say we that
they're defending freedom of speech
freedom of speech is gone
it is gone and they're going
after Rumble now and looking to finish
off the x-platform now I think Elon Musk
is going to hang it off so they're going
to have trouble finishing him off
but they're gonna try
they're gonna try I think the only
reason Elon Musk is not in jail is
because he's adding so much to our you
know space capabilities he's building
things that should be good for climate
change
but otherwise I think deep state would
have killed him by now
honestly because he's too dangerous
all of his Free Speech impulses are
are not working but even on the
x-platform I don't reach anybody
whose mind I could change
is just people who want to follow me
so
um I saw absolutely nobody disagree with
my statement their free speech is
already gone
we we should actually rewrite the
Constitution to get rid of that
not that I want to get rid of it I just
think it would make a statement
to actually have a constitutional
convention to get rid of freedom of
speech because we have this weird
situation where the Constitution
guarantees it but the system guarantees
we don't have it
so let's get the Constitution compatible
with the actual system we experience so
at least we don't have any conflict
there
we might want to double the second
amendment power we might want to
strengthen that one
all right
um Rand Paul has an article in which he
said
uh he's talking about the lack of free
speech he says for example a 2021
Pentagon program called civil sanctuary
which I've never heard of civil
Sanctuary 2021 so this is recent news
sought to develop AI tools to scale the
moderation oh the moderation
capabilities
yeah yeah they're they're hoping to get
rid of disinformation and improve the
moderation
so nothing wrong with that right because
we all like some moderation
so to develop AI tools to scale the
moderation capability of social media
platforms to create what it describes as
quote more stable information
environment
more stable information environment in
other words
to censor the people they don't want you
to hear oh he actually says that in
other words that was actually his next
sentence in other words the goal of the
Pentagon program was to exponentially
multiply the government's ability to
coordinate censorship of online speech
yes that's exactly correct
that's not spend that's not hyperbole
that is the exact accurate description
of what that is
um
yeah
and then meanwhile as Rand Paul points
out the Department of Commerce is
awarding Million Dollar grants for
cognitive Research into how the U.S
government
this one is unbelievable
so the government is spending money
to learn how you can foster trust in AI
with the general public
the government is studying
how to make the public
trust AI
why why
do you want us to trust AI
is it because you're going to use AI to
launder your opinions
yes it is
yes
so remember the the trick with
controlling the public is to launder
opinions
so you know how the the politicians do
it they'll they'll leak something to the
Press that's their friends then the
Press will report it as true even if it
isn't and then the politician will say
well don't look at me it's in the Press
so the politicians in order to lie to
you effectively need to control other
organizations which you incorrectly
believe are the keepers of Truth oh well
the fact-checking organization says it's
true
but they're owned by the politicians oh
well there's this think tank that just
came out with an opinion but they're
owned by one of the sides oh there's
this Watchdog group who complains when
there's anti-semit oh
but they also complain whenever their
team wants them to take somebody out
that they don't like
so it's always about building a a fake
structure of credible people that are
not actually credible that add that fake
credibility
now what would happen in the world of AI
if the AI told you the fact Checkers of
the think tanks and the Watchdogs were
fake
because AI would have the ability to
learn
from the entire body of knowledge of
humans and that is part of the body of
knowledge of humans
would the human programmers have to
delete that knowledge so the AI didn't
know it
and are they going to use the AI as
their ultimate cutout
well gosh I I wouldn't believe this as
the government told me but there's this
independent AI made by Amazon or Google
or Microsoft or somebody you could
totally trust and the AI says it's true
so I guess it's true
so right in front of us
they're teaching AI to be more credible
and do you think it's because AI is more
accurate
no because you know what would make AI
credible
being right
over and over again
yeah do you know why you need to study
to make IAI credible with the public
because you don't plan to make it
accurate over and over again
if it were accurate you wouldn't need to
work on this credibility
it's only inaccurate things you have to
work out their credibility there's a
reason that people are doubting it
now there's another you know if there
might be a credible thing that's poorly
communicated but I don't think that's
what's Happening Here
foreign so that's your next effort to
remove your uh free speech now why would
anybody want to remove your free speech
well let me give you an example that's
in the news
uh
the USA is going to fund the World Bank
with 25 billion dollars
that will go toward rebuilding Ukraine
that money will be uh largely or partly
managed by the newly
reborn Clinton Global initiative
that had gone on along Hiatus when Trump
was in charge
yeah why did they need to go on a long
Hiatus when Trump was the president
it's just a charity
why wouldn't the charity just do what it
was doing all the time
because it couldn't do it when Trump was
in charge
because it's not a legitimate
organization and it would be too obvious
but when their own team is in charge and
more importantly when the team that's in
charge can control your freedom of
speech as they do
you could you and I could know the
following fact
that that's the sketchiest looking thing
you've ever seen in your life and it
seems super obvious that the Clinton
Foundation is
going to siphon off billions of dollars
right in front of you and there's
nothing you can do about it
now the only thing I can think that you
can do about it is to tell the Democrats
so that both the Democrats and the
Republicans are on the same side and
saying whoa whoa none of us like
corruption
you know this is not politics this is
corruption none of us like corruption so
we'll stop it
so do you think that any Democrat knows
that this is a problem
nope nope you and I know but we already
knew it right if I tell you the Clinton
Global initiative is a problem
is there even one person here who didn't
already know that no I'm just talking to
the converted
you're already on the same page there's
not a single Democrat the only ones who
would make a difference in this case
because you need Unity there's not a
single Democrat who will ever hear what
I'm saying
there's not a single Democrat will ever
hear you say the Clinton Global
initiative is crooked and somewhat
obviously so
and and they get any details and find
out what's going on
so there's absolutely no free of speech
because I have no way of reaching a
Democrat
when was the last time a a Democrat
entity invited me for a major uh news
head
I don't remember
you stop it all the time but as soon as
I started saying things that made sense
and disagreed with their narrative
I'm dead to the world now I'm just a
canceled disgraced cartoonist they'll
never have me on now
see how this works
all right
um so the reason we don't have free
speech is because the bad guys couldn't
get away with something that's so
obviously crooked if we had free speech
all right uh Washington Post made news
by uh being honest
I'm not even joking
The Washington Post which is allegedly a
news organization but people watching
this know it's not really a news
organization it's a it's an intelligence
op on the country
you all know that right well let me test
this I'll bet everyone watching now
knows that the Washington Post is not
even designed as a news organization
it's just a propaganda entity right
every single person watching this knows
that to be a fact how many Democrats do
you think know that
I would guess none I've never met one
I've literally never met one
there's no free speech if there were
anything like free speech the Democrats
would at least know that other people
think this even if they disagreed they
at least know what your opinion was but
no they will never be exposed to it
all right here's here's how they made
news at least on social media uh for
being honest
so they ran that poll Washington Post
and ABC News did a joint poll that said
that Trump was 10 points up on Biden in
the general election now that was way
outside other polls results
and but the Washington Post to their
credit
said you know right up front that the
result you know I think it was the
subtitle to the headline so right up
front they said this that this poll does
not match other recent polling
and that it might be an outlier in other
words The Washington Post was telling
you right up front very prominently
we did this poll but even we don't think
you should necessarily believe it
now that feels like an upgrade doesn't
it
it's an upgrade because they did the
poll they didn't hide it from you and
then they told you quite honestly this
doesn't make sense with the other polls
so don't don't assume it'll last
that's that's good work isn't it
but as other people pointed out
they've done a lot of sketchy things in
the past and they've never pointed it
out in advance
why is this the one time they criticize
their own work
the one time
is it because it's good for Trump
seems like a pretty big coincidence
right so even when they even when
they're honest
they're honest in the way that's
dishonest
that was a tough one to pull off
they were completely honest and
forthright
and by doing so
they became more dishonest because of
all the times they haven't done it
it's quite a trick to pull that off
all right
um
apparently Miss America the Korean Miss
America is a nuclear fuel engineer
that's a long way to saying she's not as
attractive as past uh
title holders but uh well there you have
it
no I'm just joking I'm just joking she's
not as attractive as past title holders
but I think that's a coincidence
uh no I'm just joking I'm just joking
I'm just joking she's very she's very
attractive
anyway
um there's an article in the Wall Street
Journal talking about her
Jennifer Hiller wrote this article
and I I was caught by this sentence
it says does the U.S need more nuclear
power
Miss America thinks so so do Oliver
Stone Elon Musk and Sam Oldman
so the the tone of the article is that
these following people who are you know
prominent people are pro-nuclear and so
you should take it seriously as well
and I'm thinking to myself
really I feel like they left out a few
people
that that may have been there as well
but it does help that famous smart
people
uh including a nuclear fuel engineer who
was also Miss America uh think that
nuclear power is
you know necessary and we should do a
lot more of it
yeah Sam Altman's the um
head of chat GPT
all right
um it says atomic energy is elbowing its
way back into the conversation
okay
um
here's something that Elon Musk said a
while ago that desalinization is
absurdly cheap I guess he said that to
uh
Bill Maher
so that would be another thing that Bill
Maher was not aware of that
desalinization is absurdly cheap
now that's interesting because whenever
anybody talks about it they talk about
how expensive it is
it wasn't obvious to me that it's cheap
I just knew that it worked I knew that
it worked if you had no option such as
in the Middle East they don't have a lot
of options but they have enough money so
they can make it work what I didn't know
is that the efficiency and cost keep
dropping and if you were to add on top
of that a nuclear power plant so the
cost of energy dropped
you pretty much have all the water you
want
I saw a product
for sale on Instagram
advertised on Instagram that was a a
household kitchen device
that creates water and of air
and you just plug it in and you're done
you just plug it in and it starts
creating water out of air and fills the
thing and makes I don't know two gallons
a day something like that
so and that looked
that looked pretty efficient so I've got
a feeling that the Adam's law of
slow-moving disasters is going to solve
our water problems as well as our energy
problems we'll have nuclear we'll have
desalinization we'll be able to reforest
deserts and fix climate change
that's what I see happening
all right
um would you like to see me get Triple
canceled
anybody
triple cancellation
double triple cancellation
I'm gonna need a whiteboard to pull this
off
I saw a horribly racist comment
today on social media it was a video of
a smash and grab robbery where lots of
people come in at the same time and they
they dominate the store and grab
everything
this one was in England I think
and the commenter said
uh in a very racist way
why don't we ever see video of white
people doing this because all the people
doing the robbing were black in that
video
and I would like to address that
question
do you think I could do it without
getting canceled
why do we only see video of black people
involved in smashing grabs
now if there's any video of anybody else
doing it maybe it's just I haven't seen
them so that could be another theory
they're all out there but for some
reason we only see some of them
can't rule that out it seems unlikely
but can't rule it out all right so
whiteboard
here are the different theories for why
it is that the videos this has nothing
to do with the people
we're talking about the videos videos
are not people
why are the videos also one-sided
and I would give you these theories
yeah it's hard to get this so everybody
can see it
I think that'll work
all right you got some racist theories
there's something in the DNA of these
people
don't think so uh there's something
about the culture which is sort of a
clever way to say it's the DNA
I'm not sure those are two different
or somebody will say it's about poverty
which is another way to group these
things
now if it were about poverty you would
see lots of other groups doing it
because there are lots of poor people of
all type would you agree
so you could rule out poverty because
you're not seeing poor people of every
group doing it at least in the videos I
don't know what's happening in reality I
just know what the video show
is it culture I would say no
if it were a culture
um or there's just something about the
Black Culture wouldn't you see it
everywhere
you know you're not seeing it in the
historically black college campuses
there's no smash and grab of the you
know the College bookstore
right so there's something else going on
and it's not DNA because again there are
plenty of people not doing it so it's
not baked into somehow you weren't born
with it
so what else could it be here's what I
think it is
I think there's the most non-racist take
on this which I think is the accurate
one
is if you live in a world with CRT ESG
and Dei and we're talking about
reparations and systemic racism you've
created a narrative that one group owes
the other group some stuff
that's the dominant cultural narrative
in America is that one group
owes the other groups their stuff
now if you took any group of Americans
and you put them in a situation where
the dominant narrative I mean almost the
operating system of the country says hey
somebody's got your stuff
well where is it well it's probably in
their store
your stuff is in that store you better
go get it
what would you expect to happen
how could you have any other outcome you
could replace black Americans with
albonians or any other group
if you spend all day long telling them
that the other group has your stuff
and it's in that store
and you could get it out without risk if
you go with your buddies if you all go
you can get your stuff back
what do you expect to happen if you
design the system
that guarantees you get this outcome and
then you get this outcome why would you
look at anything except
the design of the system
right that hasn't it always been true
that you know a group of people could
you know run into a store and grab stuff
and get away with it it's probably
always been true
but
it's never been so authorized I mean the
fact that
um bail has been removed for shoplifting
so what would you you know what would
you make of the fact where they removed
the penalties for shoplifting and then
they spend all day long telling you that
the rich people and the white people
took your stuff and it's in the store
just go get it back
so that's my theory
so I think
um if you're if you're stuck on the
narrative that social media wants to
feed you that there's just something
wrong with this group of people
I think you're missing the big picture
the big picture is that the operating of
the system of the country is designed to
incentivize one group of people
to take stuff from another group of
people
and incentives work
incentives always work
there's no situation where incentives
don't work they've worked everywhere in
every situation from the beginning of
time so we designed the system
that incentivizes one group of people to
Rob stores in Mass
and then we're saying why is this
happening because we incentivized it of
course we took away the penalties and we
added a reward hey you're getting
revenge you're getting even you're
getting your stuff back
all right well once again am I preaching
to the people who are already converted
largely
largely talking to the people who are
already converted because the larger
Point here is that there's there's a
downside
to the training that all of our youth
are getting and the population at large
there's a downside that if you're if you
train people to think that one group are
victims and the other group are
victimizers you should pretty well
predict that you end up in a South
Africa kind of situation eventually
all right
and that's why you watch coffee with
Scott Adams
for the takes that are completely uh not
free speech so we're just sort of
Talking to Ourselves but that'll give
you something to talk about when you go
on for the holidays all right ladies and
gentlemen
YouTube I think we're done here I'm
going to talk to the locals people a
little bit more and I will see you
tomorrow
