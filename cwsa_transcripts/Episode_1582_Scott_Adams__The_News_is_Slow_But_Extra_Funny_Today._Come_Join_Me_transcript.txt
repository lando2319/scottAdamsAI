good morning everybody and while i do
tell you that
coffee with scott adams is the best
thing that's ever happened to you
possibly the best thing that's ever
happened to anybody
today
a little extra good
and i'm not even joking
i just saw literally
you know three minutes ago
the best news i've seen in a long time
and i don't know if you've seen it yet
you suspected it was coming
but are you ready for it
i'm just gonna look at my other computer
and just read you the headlines
right just
just savor it okay
it goes like this
sigh of relief in south africa oh
sorry let me put on the microphone
here's the good news for you
sigh of relief in south africa as
omicron omicron variant appears to be
super mild
super mild
and the death rate is not jumping
and
it says the who who and coronavirus
experts are increasingly convinced that
the new omicron variant is quote
super mild
i think
i think something's good happens is
happening here and here's the funny
thing
um
i'm can i'm increasingly convinced that
the only way any virus ever ends is it
becomes its own vaccination
now that's the thing right am i wrong
that that's an actual thing
some people suspect that's what stopped
the
spanish flu right
now there might be some disagreement on
that but
my current view is i can't think of
anything else that would ever stop a
virus
you know once it reaches pandemic
proportions what else would do it
i mean it's not human intervention
i don't think so
you know and uh it's not vaccinations
so
this thing may have uh
and here's the fun part
you've got all these oh god i'm trying
not to swear
woo
that was it was hard to choke that one
back again i could do this again without
the cursing
deep breath
think of all the fine fine human beings
see what i did there i could have been
swearing there
but instead the fine human beings
that are preparing to charge us another
10 trillion dollars for vaccinations and
medications
what would happen
if a variant destroyed their entire
business model trillions of dollars
it might be happening
here's how you know that it might be
happening
the news won't tell you i had to look at
some like weird little new source to say
that
that the omicron looks uh mild now i
would wait for extra sources to say that
i wouldn't consider what i just read to
you to be a
you know a highly credible source but
i think it's common
and it could be that all these weasels
who have been trying to figure out every
way to charge us
we'll get to the sip
every way the charges may be thwarted
to the to the tune of possibly trillions
of dollars
all right how can we take this good news
into even better feelings than we
already have well
that's something called the simultaneous
sip and all you need is a cup of mugger
and glass a tanker chelsea steiner tank
a canteen sugar flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and here it comes
good
oh
so good
well joe biden uh is allegedly suffering
from a bad cold
that he
it's not covered
he's got a bad cold and his uh
his speech was sounding a little
different
and
in fact doctors said he had a quote a
frog in his throat
he had a frog in his throat
which would explain
why his speaking
recently
has been so
riveting
yeah i'll just let that riveting
now i thought that was a good pun when i
tweeted it
but i was embarrassed and humiliated by
this better pun from allison arkham who
is a writer
so at least she's a professional i hate
to be beaten by non-professionals
but if a professional
tops me all right
that's fair and here's what she said
about joe biden having a
frog in his throat
she she said about joe biden i think
he's been a tad
polarizing
he's been a tadpole arising yeah he's
been a little he's been a tad polarizing
slow clap
good pun
all right in the cnn fake news category
oh it's delicious this time joy reid
was talking about
he tweeted about the story that
governor desantis wants to establish
what cnn refers to as a world war ii era
civilian military force oh my god that
not the pentagon would control the cnn
article goes on
but in a nod to the growing tensions
between
and he called uh would not be encumbered
by the federal government
scary isn't it whoa
and i believe that it was joy reid of
msnbc who tweeted and
said it was a fascisty banana stuff
fascisty banana stuff that's what
desantis is doing
it wasn't until the fourth paragraph
the cnn acknowledged
that there are already 23 states that
have such a force
so joy reid
is looking at this and saying oh it's
fascist it's bananas
and he would be the 24th state to do it
no problem yet
basically 200 volunteers
now apparently
joy reid and others are worried that the
200 volunteers
will be such a
well-trained fighting force that they
can take on the largest
military
in the galaxy
the united states military
so that's what joy reid is worried about
and that seemed quite ridiculous even to
sarah silverman
who called on joyride's tweet
and tweeted back at her and said please
read the article before you post this
stuff
you're the news outlet the truth has to
matter
now if you follow politics and celebrity
input into politics you would know that
sarah silverman is
not a friend of the right
she would be very very left anti-trump
kind of a
personality but even sarah silverman can
see clear as day
that this was fake news
from a news outlet
now
it's happening people
we're very very close to the damn
bursting
i i've been getting a slow trickle
of examples of people on the left who
are flipping
now not flipping politically you know
they're not becoming
republicans nothing like that
but they're flipping in the sense that
they're realizing that their
the movie they've been watching was
always fiction
they thought it was a documentary
they thought
they were watching real news and they
weren't
they're just finding out
that it's not real and
i have a hypothesis
with no data whatsoever to back it just
based on
what i know about people that i'm not
surprised that people in the movie
industry
would notice this before others on the
left
because they deal in movies
and stories
and stories have surprise endings
and they're just finding out the
surprise ending of their own story
the news
was never real
that's a perfect movie
a perfect movie is when they realize
wait a minute
are you telling me that for years
for years
none of it's been real
not the political stuff
none of the political stuff has been
real if you
consider the context right the facts are
real often
sometimes not
but the context is always narrative so
the context is never real it's always
just a story
and it doesn't surprise me that people
write those kinds of stories for a
living would start to recognize the
pattern
wait a minute
i think bruce willis has been dead all
along
didn't want to ruin any movies there but
you know what i'm talking about
um
so look for that look for more people in
the movie industry to to figure out that
their own news has been fake speaking of
fake narratives
are you watching the story of the the
high school shooter whose parents were
let's say not good parents
uh we believe
and uh
they are so cult
culpable it looks like if not legally
liable
they certainly feel some responsibility
i think
well i don't want to read their minds
rather let me back up i won't read their
minds i'll just say that they
they seem to make themselves hard to
find for a while either for their own
safety or for whatever reasons
but
the lawyer said it was for their own
safety but now they're in custody and
here's the part that's just too perfect
their names are the crumblies their last
name actually has crumb in it
they're white people
who apparently like guns and
don't take care of them as well as they
should
there are actually white people
who are going to be stuck into the
narrative of
of adults especially white males and
guns being the big problem those white
males and their guns
now
do you get it crumbly oh you got it
somebody on somebody on the locals got
it first
crumbly
what is crumbly name something that's
crumbly
a cracker
a cracker
is crumbly
the the simulation actually served up
the ideal
white people who do everything wrong
with guns
and their name is actually based on a
freaking cracker
now if this is not made
for
the ideal narrative nothing is
i mean these two parents did sort of
everything wrong you know gun wise
leaving it unlocked being you know chief
among them
so
but let me push back on one element of
the story apparently there's part of the
story is that
people should have known that this kid
was going to do something because he he
drew some violent drawings
including
including a little uh i guess a word
bubble or something that had
himself thinking that he can't stop the
thoughts that it showed him you know
shooting somebody else in the class i
guess
so
if you saw that a
15 year old boy
draw drew a little comic type picture
that included violence of somebody
shooting somebody else
how how alarmed should you be
in the comments tell me that's a real
question 15 year old boy drawing
pictures of violence specifically
somebody shooting somebody
how concerned would you be
i know i did it a lot
in fact it was the number one most
most uh
common thing that
people at age 15 drew
is violence
it was the number one thing that young
boys draw pictures of
except for sex right of you know
gigantic penis pictures that's the only
other thing that boys draw
giant penises possibly boobs
and then violence
usually somebody being shot in the head
am i right i mean
can all the males who are on there just
confirmed for me
that you have drawn violent pictures
involving gunfire
as a child or a teen let's say 15 year
olds yeah look at the yeses
the yeses are just screaming by we all
you know i don't know if we all do it
but it's literally the most common thing
but you read it you read it in the news
and it's like you idiot adults
couldn't you tell that this was real
to which i say no
no you can't tell
and i put myself in that situation and i
say
would i have known
would i have known
and and the answer i have to give myself
is
ah
i'm not sure i can't say yes
i could say oh in in hindsight i know
what happened so yes i might have been
alerted but really
really
really can i tell myself i would have
spotted that i just don't know
i don't i don't think i would have
i'd bet against myself actually in this
situation
um
yeah there are lots of questions about
this especially the interplay of what is
the parents responsibility versus the
child
versus the bullies i'm the only one
who'll say that
um
so the crumblies are the perfect
narrative so we'll see more of the
crumblies and a lot less of waukesha
do you know that this really happened to
me
yesterday i saw a tweet about somebody
who said
that waukesha is already being memory
hold and you know we're forgetting that
it happened and i looked at the tweet
and said waukesha
waukesha which one is that
that actually happened
i actually had literally forgotten
waukesha
and and the media made us forget it now
let me see if we can do this the other
way let's see if it works the other way
i'm going to give you a last name
to see if you recognize the first name
just automatically
floyd
floyd
does anybody anybody automatically know
the first name of mr floyd
yeah and george
not going to forget that are you
so when you see the media directly
manipulating your memory
and your memory is the number one thing
probably
except the media fear your memory would
be that one of the biggest things that
influences your future decisions
because you can say well it was like
this before so this tells me something
that that informs my future decisions so
when they're manipulating their memory
they're programming you
they're programming your next
decisions
they're not they're not just erasing the
past
they're programming your next decisions
by erasing what they erase and by
focusing on what they focus on
all right uh
kathy griffin is calling out cnn
because uh they let tubin keep his job
for uh yankin his tuban
on a zoom call not on the network but
you know on a zoom call
uh and uh
kathy griffin lost her gig her uh new
year's eve gig that she would do for cnn
because of her holding up the severed
head of
trump the bloody head in a a joke
now
here's my comment on that
are those two things
exactly the same
one
was done with great intention and
planning
it took a lot of work to get that
severed head
to look just right and photograph it
so one took a whole bunch of planning
the other one
toobin
didn't even know what was happening
until after was done he was actually
literally unaware
until afterwards
is that the same
and also you know
you know one is
promoting violence and the other is
promoting
self-love
i mean
if you can't love yourself who can you
love
so i'm going to say that kathy griffin's
comparison of those two things is not on
point i love kathy griffin by the way
i've met her a few times i've worked
with her and so i like her personally
just in case that's not coming through
in in my
conversation here but i don't think
those situations are the same but what i
love about this is that um
cnn is being called out for big sexist
cnn is being called out for being sexist
well i guess
you create a standard you have to live
by it don't you
so that's the standard that the
news on the left creates and i guess
i'll have to live up to it
um i told you that even though abortion
the the changes that are being
contemplated with the mississippi case
and the supreme court
that even no matter how that goes
that
that the democrats will use it to rile
up the base now there's some
some difference of opinion of whether
this is enough of an issue
these days to rile up the base or not
but cnn is already trying
um and they're talking about uh how it's
gonna how that issue is gonna motivate
people etc
and
that's an example of them making it a
priority
if cnn reports hey i think democrats are
going to treat this as their priority it
encourages it right it's like hey
everybody knows this is a priority get
on board
it's sort of like communicating to the
base
right there are some people who think
this might work and then cnn's going to
tell the rest of them
so that they can all can get on board on
this strategy
so that's happening right now cnn
basically working with the democrats to
make sure that this issue can be
something that they could talk about
going forward
um speaking of cnn a lot of news about
cnn today this news about the news but
cnn is dumping on kamal harris again and
the way they're doing it
is shocking
here's something that actually appeared
on cnn
they're quoting somebody apparently in
the
uh kamal harris camp
saying that if she were a man with her
management style
doing a tv show that tv show would be
called the apprentice
that's right
cnn is reporting
that harris's own people
are likening her
to donald trump
in management style
cnn's reporting that
about a democrat about kamala harris
she is so done
she's as done
as you could be done as a politician
clearly cnn's
has the message or is sending the
message that she's not the future
and this is pretty clear at this point
uh they blame her of bad management and
then bullying and more people are going
to leave and
it's just a whole cluster situation over
there
all right here's some more fake news
that i wasn't sure was fake news um
and it's actually fake news about fake
news
so this is going to be a fake news
squared
so there's some baseline fake news
and then we're going to tell you about
the hill the publication the hill
who corrects the fake news
but adds more fake news by correcting
the news
it's like you can't get away from the
fake news so let me explain the
situation
so the claim
that i kind of thought might have been
truish you know i hadn't really looked
into it i sort of believed the left when
they were claiming that
most of the tax cuts under trump
went to the rich
because we've been hearing that repeated
and repeated so i thought well
it's probably true
yeah maybe that's true
and so here's how the hill
debunks that claim
and
what you should do is find the fake news
that's in the debunk
all right so the debunk i think is
accurate as far as i can tell because it
comes from the irs so it's probably a
pretty good source
but
see if you can tell me what the fake
news is all right
so this is actually from the hill quote
uh
a careful analysis of the irs tax data
one that includes the effects of tax
credits and other reforms so in other
words if you do the math right it shows
that filers with an adjusted gross
income of fifteen
thousand to fifty thousand
so that would be on the the lowest end
of incomes
enjoyed an average tax cut of sixteen
percent to 26
in 2018
that's the first year's
first year of that tax cut
but filers were in the 50 to 100 so now
you're getting up to the middle-ish
class
received
15 to 17.
so as the income went up it was a little
bit less but quite significant
but when you get all the way up to um
a hundred thousand to five hundred
thousand a year
the adjusted gross income was cut by 11
to 13.
so just the way you'd want it to to be
you'd want the lowest income people to
get the highest percentage
and the highest income people to get the
lowest percentage
apparently that's exactly what happened
um
and so they conclude that means most
middle-income and working-class earners
enjoyed a tax cut
that was at least double the size of tax
cuts received by households earning a
million or more
so where's the fake news
okay over on locals they all got the
right answer the fake news is that they
reported percentages without raw numbers
have i taught you that any article that
shows percentages without raw numbers is
fake news
likewise
any report that shows you raw numbers
without percentages is also fake news
because real news would show you both
because you you don't really know
anything until you know the wrong number
and the percentage you got to have both
so anything that shows you one without
the other either one
is fake news
it's a narrative
apparently they want you to believe a
certain thing and they're leaving out
something that would have completely
changed your opinion
that's right locals gets it right again
so
fake news about fake news although i
appreciate that the hill uh did get
these you know got these percentages and
that did add a lot to the story i just
wish they'd added the some more about
the raw numbers to balance that out
um
why is it that i focus so much on the
hoaxes and why am i going nuts on the
hoaxes right now does anybody know can
anybody tell me
what's my strategy
because i like to see how transparent i
am sometimes
what's my strategy of going extra extra
hard at the hoaxes right now because
you've seen me do it on twitter right
why now
well persuasion yes attention
i always like persuasion i always like
attention but those are sort of baseline
yep uh
over on locals again
correct answer correct answer is
we might be close to a breaking point
i i feel like
the the last few shoves can push
something over the edge it's like
it might not break i mean maybe maybe
the left's narratives are just you know
too hard and we can't break them but it
sure feels like it
i feel like we're getting really close
right
and if we can get
if we can get anybody on the left to
understand even one of the major hoaxes
was a hoax
i think the dam breaks
for at least for that one person
and then if you can get if you get any
everybody on the left
to believe that at least one of the
hoaxes was a hoax
suddenly the dam will break and i'm
feeling it and i want to give you a
persuasion technique
that is about the this one hoax that i
think is the one that will unlock
you know basically unlock the door or
to mix my metaphors you know
the dam will break
and i think it's the drinking uh the
drinking bleach hoax
now
two things about that that are
interesting
it's the only double root bar that i i
know of
now a rupaur edit of a video it's named
after aaron rupar
a rupar edit is when you take part of a
video out and somehow that re reverses
its meaning that's how the find people
hoax was done how the overfeeding koi
fish was done how the covington kids
hoax was done and then the drinking
bleach oaks but the drinking bleach oaks
has an extra element that makes it
sticky
it's a double root bar
it removes that the end of it
but also the beginning
and if you if you don't remove both
then people can still see the context
but if you remove
just one of them
it still works
so people will say no no no scott
let me show you the full quote to show
you that you're wrong
and then they won't show me the full
quote they'll show me a half rupaul you
know like one of the things deleted
which still keeps the wrong meaning or
at least it's ambiguous that way but but
if you see the book ends it with light
then you know oh he was talking about
light the whole time okay so here's what
uh here's what i want you to do if you
get into a personal conversation over
the holidays
with somebody who believes the drinking
bleach hoax are you ready
this is this is a way to unprogram them
and i tweeted it but you can use any
version of this for yourself so somebody
says that trump said suggested drinking
bleach
get them for a moment get their full
attention
make sure there are no distractions
right because you don't want them to use
the distraction to run away from the
conversation make sure you have their
full attention and then say this
i just want to check with you on uh on
your thinking process here
um do you believe that an adult human
being
with a college education
who ran a real estate empire
and rose to the presidency of the united
states
that that person
believes that injecting a chemical
disinfectant into a human body would be
a good idea
such a good idea that he would say it in
public
is that what you believe
now watch what happens
when the where your subject starts
squirming
i don't believe anybody will look at you
and say yup
that's what i believe
i think just asking the question that
way
though and then if they do say that
just repeat yourself say okay
i may have heard you wrong
but it's your actual opinion that a a
real human being
who can function in the world and
you know run a big company run for
president and win
that a human being with that level of
education and knowledge about the world
actually
literally
really suggested in public
to inject a chemical disinfectant into a
person
do you really believe that
watch what happens
watch what happens you you're going to
shake them to the core
because they don't believe that
then suppose they say but scott he said
it he said it he said you just can't
talk him out of it maybe you don't have
access to the transcript
so you're gonna say okay
the president
then here's here's the backup wait for
this you're gonna love this next part
you're gonna love this next part say to
him now do you believe that when the
president used the word disinfectant
he was using it in a medical scientific
sense
or do you think he was using it in more
of a let's say a layperson sense
that a disinfectant would be something
that gets rid of an infection
would would you accept
that the word disinfectant often is used
for a chemical disinfectant but that if
you were just using it casually
you would imagine that anything that
gets rid of an infection
would be a disinfectant in fact they
were talking about light in that context
as one of but not the only one
but one of the disinfectants
so
do you believe
that the president thought there was
something you could inject into the body
that would get rid of an infection
do you see where i'm going yet
and then your person will say ha ha ha
there's nothing you can
you can inject
there's nothing you can inject into a
body
that's going to get rid of a you know a
virus
have you heard of regeneron
have you heard of
vaccinations
now vaccinations might be a little
different
but
regeneron is the number one most
effective thing
it is injected into the body
and it gets rid of infections
what would be another word for
removing infection
deleting an infection
if you were to get rid of an infection
what would be what would be one word
that would capture that
disinfectant maybe
now certainly if you were a layperson
would you would you call something
that's a
a chemical
that gets rid of an infection
would you call that a disinfectant
well if you're a doctor probably not
you'd call it regeneron
you call it a monoclonal antibody
but if you're a lay person
could you imagine that there'd be
something that you could inject into the
body
that would disinfect it
yes it's the number one thing we use in
the united states and around the world
to disinfect people who have coveted
it's just not the way that the doctors
talk about it
now
why did trump say he was being sarcastic
i can't read his mind
but what would you do in that situation
and this is the way to answer the
question how would you handle it
what are the alternatives
i'll tell you one of the alternatives is
to say
it's something that i thought i saw
somewhere but i can't remember
how's that sound
well why did you bring up
drinking bleach would say the news he
never did that of course but they say
why did you bring up drinking bleach
just because you heard it somewhere like
where did you hear it
do you think he remembered where he
heard it
here's the background at about that time
i was tweeting about a a specific trial
in which they were using a
ventilator-like device to put uv light
into a human patient and they were
considering extending it into the lungs
why bring it up at all if he's president
because he was talking about the
possibilities in an optimistic way if
you haven't noticed the president's an
optimist
so when he was in there he was saying
hey maybe this would work maybe this
would work he was going through things
that might make it work
remember that's what he does
that's he says that directly he's a
cheerleader for the country he's an
optimist
so that's why he brought it up that's
his job
to be optimistic about the direction of
the country when it when it makes sense
right
so
here's what i think happened now this is
a hypothesis but it's a strong one
just prior to the pl the time when he
was on stage talking about that
there was some tweets going around that
i tweeted
personally
and mentioned a number of times on my
live stream
which is this test where they're
injecting uv light into the
into the trachea and then potentially
thinking maybe it could work in the
lungs itself
and i tweeted that
now i do know because i've heard from a
number of sources that the white house
would watch this live stream fairly
regularly as in
pretty much every day
and they also follow me on twitter
which i know because i watch you
retweets me etc
now
i know
the white house staff
knew about this study
of injecting uv light into a patient
i know it because they followed me and i
mentioned it i don't know five times
so certainly
staff saw it
do you think that trump wanted to tell
people
it was something he saw on a
cartoonist's twitter account
go
that was that could have been his only
alternative if you wanted to tell you
the truth
he would have said i don't remember
where i saw it which doesn't sound good
or maybe i saw it on a tweet which
doesn't sound good or maybe i heard it
from a cartoonist which doesn't sound
good
what was he supposed to do
trying to just make it go away as a joke
that wasn't a bad idea
it just didn't work
you know i mean he didn't have any good
choices
if if he had been like up to date on it
and he could refer you to the study off
hand
then maybe that would have been a good
play but do you think he could have
mentioned the name of the hospital
and the name of the technology and where
it was being trialled do you think he
could have just popped that out of his
head
no
no
even i can't and i've tweeted it i
forget the name of the technology myself
i've tweeted it like 50 times
uh flip this with ivermectin and natural
immunity i don't know the context for
that
um
yeah anyway so try these two approaches
just ask somebody if they really
literally believe
that a educated adult thought that
ordinary household disinfectants
could be a solution to covet
yeah heel light is the name of that
technology thank you heal
light all right
dan crenshaw tweeted why are we still
pretending that cell phones and laptops
can actually affect the airplane
um and i replied to him
channeling my best steven wright pattern
recognition
i said i once tried steering the plane
with my phone and i think it worked
but it's hard to tell because i was
going to the same place the plane was
already going
now i don't think stephen wright ever
told that exact joke but sort of i used
his pattern and actually people
recognized it and called it down hey
that's a stephen right joke and they are
correct one of the greatest comedians of
all time and i stole this pattern there
here's why they don't let you have cell
phones and laptops on airplanes
here's why
sir
would you please
turn off your cell phone we don't allow
phone calls during the flight
oh yeah yeah yes
just one more minute just one more
minute it's an emergency just one more
minute
sir
you cannot use your phone on the plane
it bothers the other passengers he's not
complaining and only take me a minute
so that's how those conversations would
go and then people would be like
yeah but it's a quick call
yeah but it's important
people would be using their phone on the
plane if the only reason you said they
couldn't is it's a rule
and it will bother other people
a good third of the public doesn't care
if they bother other people
right so the reason phones are told they
tell you the phones are going to kill
you is because
it's easier to say if you don't turn off
the phone we will all die
in a giant fireball during the crash
not even slightly true but way more
persuasive
now let's take the laptop
why why do they tell you to put your
laptop away
it's the same reason they tell you to
put all of your other other items away
you don't want heavy things flying
around the plane
that's why
so if they say
put your laptop away because we don't
want it flying around the plane
what does a human say
well i'll just hold on to it really
really tight
because because we're humans we say
stupid things oh if i see any trouble
i'll quickly put it in the back of the
seat
no you won't
humans are crazy they will make any
excuse to do what they want to do
so if you don't tell them
if you don't tell them
that it's going to kill them they're
going to do it
so i for one am glad that they have this
fiction about these things being
dangerous
because it keeps me from being bothered
and killed by a flying laptop
how slow is the news today i'm going to
tell you it's this slow a major trending
story today
was about seth rogen uh smoking weed and
listening to music
now the context was he went to an adele
concert and they put him in the front
he felt weird because he'd smoked a lot
of weed now they didn't ask him to sing
he wasn't called upstage to sing
literally the entire story is the the
most famous well one of them one of the
most famous paw spokers in the world
smoke some weed for a change and listen
to some music
and that's a that's a trending story
today
all right
jeff pilkington asked today on a tweet
would anyone care if cable news went
away
and the context is that there are so few
people who actually watch cable news i
think it's less than one percent of the
country
actually watches cable news at you know
any one moment
but
they did the math all wrong
so if you look at uh how many people are
watching let's say uh cuomo's old show
you know if you get 700 000 people say
700 000 people
that's all that's all that's watching
that show and of
300 and what are we up to
what's the population of the u.s 370
370 million or something
so
so the the thought is that nobody's
watching cnn because it's a tiny tiny
number compared to the population of the
country
is it only 330 million
340 somebody say we slowed down i
thought it was i thought it'd be higher
by now
all right and it was cedar sinai that
was the hospital with the uv light thank
you for reminding me
so
here's uh my take if you're looking at
the viewership of one show
you're looking at the people who just
wandered into it that one day for that
one show
but how many people watch cuomo if you
looked at his whole month
it's not the same 700 whatever number it
is it's not the same 700 000
every single show all the same people
just come back
no it's probably
some of them watched it once that week
and some of them watched it twice that
week but probably you'd have to take the
700 000 multiply it by
five maybe
to get the number of people who see it
any time during the month now remember
they repeat their stories a lot right
you know how how often was there a
george floyd story
on cnn if you if you watch cnn only once
during the whole month
you would see basically the same stories
for the whole month
so don't look at the number who are
watching at the moment
watch how many people have come into
their universe and been infected by it
and then
had to find a disinfectant later
which might be me
so
uh that's the first error of analysis is
never look at the people who are
watching it at the moment
you assume it's five times that how many
people get exposed to it over time
secondly
i don't think cnn's business model is
even anything about live tv
does that surprise you how many people
are surprised by that i don't think that
the ratings and the audience on live tv
on cnn is even relevant to them
yeah it's an online feeder exactly
locals you're so smart
locals is the smartest platform
actually i think that might be true i
was going to say it as a joke but i
think literally it's true that the
locals people on average are are more
intelligent or more well informed i
guess
so
yes i think cnn's business model has
evolved to a clip production
kind of site where they hope that their
clips get
sent around and that sends people to the
website so the website i looked it up
and found that
cnn.com has let's see
something like
half
a half a billion
people watch it
every x amount of time
what is x
kind of matters doesn't it
half a billion people watch it
every
i don't know because i looked up a
source that just said half a billion
people watch it and they didn't tell me
if that's per month which means it's a
totally worthless number but it's a big
number
it's a big number
so i think that's their deal
is uh the online stuff
all right and also the other thing about
cnn is it reaches the opinion makers
so if the only people who watched cnn
were the people who really really care
about politics well they're the ones who
tell everybody else what their opinion
would be
so it so it becomes like a seed that you
know grows into this whole tree so
that's also their influence so the
website is number three in in their
category so it's the number three in
news i guess is number 37 in the usa and
if you're in the top 50
you're pretty big website
uh and half a billion people visit every
god knows what probably a month
all right here's a uh
tweet that i did that's getting a lot of
attention but i'm going to give you some
some
context to it
so yesterday i tweeted i said a
conspiracy of democrats
fake news fbi and the cia
recently framed an american president
for russian collusion
that much we know for sure
but our election systems that can't be
fully audited or fair and accurate
according to the same people
so stop your worrying
now it's not exactly the same people but
it's you know same same groups uh have
some some influence on this
and um
here's my take on it
imagine
now correct my timeline but we've we
found out for sure that the russia
collusion thing was a hoax or at least
the left it
found out for sure
uh
after the the election
stuff right
isn't that true
give me a fact check when did we know
for sure that the russia collusion thing
was a hoax it was after the election
right
so
here's what the russia collusion hoax
did in my opinion as a
persuader with experience
you can't imagine things
until they're within the realm of
imagination in other words things are
invisible
if they're outside your realm of
imagination
when do you remember when uh i think it
was jim jordan and uh
who are the other guys early on were
saying that no no the russia collusion
thing was actually a hillary clinton
operation
do you remember the first time you heard
that
and somebody's saying really
and i i listened to that and i'm saying
really
really
this whole thing is like
a democrat thing where they've got the
fbi in it and the cias in it and you
know all the news is in it and i'm
thinking to myself
that's not even in the realm of
possibility
that was my opinion
it was not in the realm of possibility
and therefore
i considered it
probably untrue in the beginning
now as time went by
and i realized that they weren't
reporting on the steele dossier except
for the urination part of it
that's it
i can't i can't name one other thing
that was in the dossier except the
the alleged obviously not true peeing on
a mattress
can you
and i started to think wait a minute
if this is all true why are they only
telling you this one part of it that's
the most untrue part of it
well while waving their hands and saying
but the other stuff's probably true and
you're not even like mentioning it like
what are those other things
well it's not as if i didn't know that
politics can have dirty tricks duh it's
not as if i didn't know that you know
democrats and republicans too will start
untrue rumors to hurt the other side
duh
but the extent of it
the extent of it
and the collusion with the media and
especially the intelligence agencies
i didn't i didn't even think that was
possible honestly that was beyond my
imagination
so it took me a while to get there
now once we found out that was a hoax
what did it do to your ability to
imagine hoaxes
it expanded it
so if i said to you hey there's a wild
wild hoax out there and the only hoaxes
you'd ever seen were small ones
you'd say to yourself that's too big
that's way too big it's just by its
nature
i'm not going to believe that one
because that's just too wild the only
hoaxes i've ever seen are these little
ones
but now we've seen the russia collusion
hoax
to my mind and i would imagine it's
affecting other people the same way
this expanded totally and a lot
what i would now consider
the possibilities of a hoax
am i right
imagine if the order had been reversed
suppose you knew for sure and the whole
country knew that the russia collusion
hoax was a hoax and you knew that before
trump challenged the election integrity
what if he knew it before
jesse smallett is just somebody lying
about as somebody saying that's an
example
uh and thank you devin nunes was the the
other one calling bs from the beginning
i think if the order of these had been
reversed
people would be a lot more
willing to believe that the elections
are at least unsecured
you know i don't have any info i have no
knowledge that they're
that they were unfair
but certainly
unauditable that that's easy to prove
so
um
and then william barrard on twitter said
he said there was a good analysis but he
says now apply this logic to the current
medical emergency
in other words if you believe that the
russia collusion hoaxes was even
possible and
it happened
what does that say about
what we're being told about vaccinations
and lockdowns and the reason we're doing
everything
all bs right
but the thing is i think that's all
individual bs
and it's also harder to coordinate a
conspiracy theory across different
countries
it's amazing enough
that the russia collusion thing happened
in one country but but maintaining a
conspiracy theory across borders
to get every single country basically
except maybe some third world countries
who are resistors
but that would be a hard one that's like
that's even a
level of magnitude
you know
higher yeah it's just an order of
magnitude harder than even the russia
collusion one i would think just because
of too many entities involved
you can't keep a good seeker with that
many entities involved but to be fair
i would have said the same thing about
the russia collusion oaks i would have
said that's way too many people involved
for
for you know that to be a
real uh conspiracy theory
all right so here's what i say um
there is definitely a lot of sketchy
stuff happening with vaccinations
um
just all of it it all looks sketchy to
me but that doesn't mean it's all untrue
it can be true that there's a lot about
the vaccinations that are sketchy
the data might be faked
the you know they may have
they may have always known that they
couldn't get rid of it they may have
always known it had to be subscription i
would buy those things without too much
trouble
you know i could be easily convinced
that any of that was true
but
uh
we don't know exactly what's wrong so it
can be true that there's lots of sketchy
stuff around vaccinations while at the
same time maybe they're better than
nothing
those both could be true
we don't know and no way to know at this
point
all right
how many of you i asked this question on
twitter how many people knew that you
can't get regeneron
and i guess it depends on the state
but in one state you can't get it after
seven days after your symptoms another
says 10
and uh you can't get it if you've
already been admitted to a hospital
so let's say your covenant is getting
bad after seven days it's worsening
so you say to yourself i better go to
the hospital
at least i can get some regeneron there
you get to the hospital and they say one
of the criteria
is that you can't get regeneron if
you're in the hospital
who knew that
and if you had heard that wouldn't you
ask for the regeneron before you checked
into the hospital and took away your own
option
wouldn't you maybe lie about when you
saw your first symptoms if you thought
you could get a little regeneron
the fact that people don't know
that if you don't get it early you don't
get it i didn't know that
i did so
put yourself in the shoes of one
individual that i know of personally all
right
here's your situation you get coveted
symptoms
and they're not too bad
and you know that 99 whatever percent of
people just recover
so your symptoms aren't that bad and you
do a test
and sure enough you've you've got the
covet
so you say to yourself well you know
i'll look at what i should do and you
take some i don't know
some uh zithromycin and
i don't know what you're doing
uh
you know some uh whatever but you're not
doing the serious meds you're just
seeing if it gets worse
day three
looks like it's getting a little worse
and you're starting to worry but
not so bad
that you won't want to ride it out
because remember 99
just get better so yeah so you're doing
your vitamin d and stuff and then the
fourth day you think i think it's
getting better
day four and five
you're like it's not getting worse and i
feel like in some ways it might be
getting better
so you don't go to the hospital you
don't get regenerate because
looks like it might be getting better
day six
starts to get worse
but not way worse
just worse day seven
you think you're gonna die
so you go to the emergency room
and they say
we're good we're gonna have to admit you
because it does look bad
then you say can i get that regeneron i
hear that's good
and they say
you just made yourself ineligible
you waited seven days and you checked
into the hospital
guidelines say you can't get it
now
if that same person had known from day
 one
that he should get the regeneron based
on symptoms
he would have done it
right away
we have an information problem that's
actually killing people
actually literally killing people it's
an information problem so it should be
solvable
and i would like to see the biden
administration to fix that
or at least at a state level
but we need some like immediate
immediate public information
that says just to be clear
you don't know how bad your cova is
going to get on day three
you all know that right it kind of goes
up and down for a few days everybody's
had that experience who's had covet
so if you don't know if it's going to
get worse
especially if you're in any category
that's got a comorbidity
go get yourself some regeneron don't
wait for day seven
don't wait till you're checked in the
hospital
that
am i wrong that that that that piece of
information that you need to get it
early
now everybody knows it earlier is better
right
so when you say to be scott everyone
knows earlier is better
no that's not the whole story of course
we know that
but we don't know that it won't work on
day four or we don't know that it won't
work if you wait seven days i didn't
know that
in fact i thought the opposite
i thought that if you were really close
to
expiration the regeneron would be just
the thing
apparently not so much
all right
i'm going to
block frosty flake for saying the most
obnoxious and stupid comment of all
internet fame scott has coveted right
now
dude i never had it wrong
i didn't change my opinion
it's never changed there's new
information
when i get new information i like to
incorporate it into my opinion what do
you do
when you get new information do you say
uh now i'll just keep the old opinion
no
i have never
i've never said i am confident
that everybody's doing uh good work and
they have good intentions
i'm the last person who'd say that
i'm the last person who would think
everybody has good intentions
and it does look like infinite co-fid is
the business model that
is going to drive decisions i would
guess
at this point
yeah john maynard keynes says when the
facts change i changed my mind what do
you do i use that i i paraphrase that
all the time i forgot who said it the
first time
all right um
here's a
here's where i get banned forever from
social media are you ready
um i have a bs detector
do not tell me that i'm getting it right
for the first time don't say that
all right just listen to the story
just try to absorb it
i have a bs detector
uh a rule
that goes like this
if science is telling you something is
true
but your own observation keeps
seeing it not
look like that
that doesn't mean it's not true because
your anecdotal observations are not that
reliable but it is a red flag
it's a red flag
and definitely is something that tells
you maybe you should look into it
if you if your observation is not
matching the science the example i
always use
is that cigarette smoking causes cancer
now the science tells us that's true
and
every time i hear somebody has lung
cancer i say
smoker
and at least nine out of ten times it's
a smoker
so that's the case where my direct
observation fits perfectly with what the
science says so that seems pretty good
now let's take vaccinations
i hear the jaws music already
to understand i'm in
i'm in dangerous waters
dangerous waters
when the vaccinations first came out
we heard stories you know on the
internet of blah blah blah people
dropping dead from the shot and i said
to myself well those are anecdotal
reports
and they're also predictable and
guaranteed
just because so many people are involved
you're always going to have anecdotes
of people having bad experiences
so i discounted all the anecdotes
because they were really predictable
anecdotes and not in any kind of number
that i should worry about
however
the longer the anecdotes keep coming
and especially
when they get you personally
if you have a friend who's double
vaccinated and just got the covet and
put him in the hospital
you start to think huh
i'm starting to see the accumulation
of anecdotes
a little bit bigger than i thought
so i'm gonna i'm gonna call the turn
for me personally okay today's the turn
in my opinion
anecdote and science don't match anymore
that doesn't mean the science is wrong
can i be as clear as possible about this
i'll still bet on the science
if you said gun to head
you've got to put your money on it now
are you going to bet
that the vaccinations help i'm only
going to say help they're obviously not
vaccinations in the classic sense but if
i had to put money on it
just for myself and again i'm not trying
to convince you to get vaccinated i
don't do that
if i had to bet on it i'd still bet on
the science
but it's a lot closer than it used to be
because anecdote
is starting to build up
right
now you're having the same experience
are you not
that you're hearing more and more
anecdotes of double-vaxxed people
having a bad income
i still believe
if i had to bet on it that the science
is still the one that's right
because you would also it's predictable
that the anecdotes would reach a fevered
pitch as well
and they are
but there's something about hearing
about it personally that changes you
you know that
we'll get rid of
ben ben
um
you're kind of an so i'm gonna
hide you
bye ben
all right so here's what i don't want
you to do
please do not leave this and say
scott just turned against vaccinations
because that didn't didn't happen
don't think that i told you you should
should or should not get vaccinated
because i never do that
i can only tell you you know my thinking
process and maybe help you with your
thinking process but
personal decision i'm not going to be
the one suggesting you jab stump the
stuff in your body
so
all i'm saying is that the anecdotes
have reached a level where i turned
today now now my suspicion
is uh at the highest level it's been
dr johnson always consistent it's good
to have a
troll who just disappeared
uh can we
revisit the topic of unvaccinated and
recovered people does anybody disagree
on that topic
i feel like that's a nonsense topic
because don't we all believe at this
point that somebody who's recovered has
better
antibodies than someone who just had a
vaccination
now they might be similar for you know a
month or so if you're triple vaxxed
but i don't think the lasting
uh
yeah
no booster for scott uh i will get a
booster
and i don't recommend uh that you do or
do not remember these are all personal
decisions
you know there's nothing that makes
sense for me that's going to make sense
for you
so you make your own decisions so here's
uh do you want to hear the worst reason
for making a vaccination decision
if i've told you anything it's that
people are irrational and they
rationalize after the fact
how many people will would
are with me on that that the vaccinated
vaccine decision
is an irrational decision that we
rationalize as having made sense and the
reason it's an irrational decision is we
don't have good data
do you agree
how many of you know what the outcome of
the vaccination will be in five years
nobody
it's unknowable so if we don't have data
how are we making the decision
completely irrationally but then we
rationalize it after the fact and we
wonder why our rationalization doesn't
match the other guy's rationalization
yeah then kids are of course a special
case
all right so uh i had a really good
point before that paid comment
knocked me off my path there
ah
oh the rationalization so i was going to
tell you i have a little bit of
awareness of my own rationalization
which is rare
right here's my own rationalization and
i didn't realize it until recently
i have an irrational
reason for getting the vaccination and i
haven't heard this from anybody yet
if i don't get the vaccination and i die
compare that to i do get the vaccination
and i die
which one makes me feel dumber the day
before i die
that's how i made my decision
and you know what
that's pretty dumb
pretty dumb
but it's not dumber than the way you did
it
[Laughter]
the way i did is totally dumb
the way you did it just as dumb
because we don't have data if you had
data and you use that plus your good
reason i'd say well that's good data
that's good reason that's way better
than what i did because my way was dumb
i just said to myself
how will i feel how embarrassed will i
be to have made the wrong decision on
the day before i die
very embarrassed now
you might feel the opposite
you might say that if i got the got the
thing and died that wouldn't be too
embarrassing
but if i got the vaccination
and the vaccination killed me man i
would feel embarrassed
on the last day before i died
so i imagine
that in on some level
maybe some of you who made the opposite
decision were thinking the same thing
which one would feel more embarrassing
i
chose the one that would
feel less embarrassing the day before i
died
how rational is that
not
not at all
not even little because the day after
i'm dead
i'm dead
none of it matters
i've got a reason that could not be a
dumber reason
and it's actually my reason and
every once in a while you can you can
take yourself out of your
your you know your biased body and just
sort of look at it as an observer
you know take an observer's point of
view and you look at it you go
you know
those thoughts about how you'd feel on
that last day
they keep bubbling up
are you sure that didn't have anything
to do with your decision and then you
have this day where you go oh crap
that was the only reason i made my
decision and i think it is i think it's
the only reason i made the decision
all right
you're in good health besides asthma i
saw a study that said if you
had asthma you would have a better
chance
of recovering from covet
or not getting a figure which was now i
don't believe that but
you said it was a big difference
now i think that would be because asthma
users use budesinide
typically i use it
and it's one of the treatments for
recovered
so maybe that has something to do with
it
um
do you think the government's going to
do lockdowns in the united states
yeah i'm not when i say that i would uh
feel stupid it's not that i would feel
stupid for the in terms of a public
opinion of me that wouldn't matter if
it's the day before i die
but i'd feel just internally stupid
and that would bug me
um
all right i think that's just about all
you know that let me just add one more
thing because i saw a comment there
anybody who tells you that your decision
about vaccine or unvaccine is based on
fear
just say after you to that person
because it's all based on fear
every decision for or against getting
vaccinated is based on fear you're just
afraid of different things
some are afraid that the government
you know has given them bad drugs and
didn't test it some people are afraid of
covid i think the vaccination's a little
better chance but it's all fear
you know
you may be processing it as part of your
logical rational thought but no
no it's all fear
and one of my fears is how i'd feel if i
made the wrong decision
crumley's gun was not locked yeah
we don't know about that
okay best show ever i i think that's
true
how many would say this is the best
show i've ever done
do you know why because it's the best
show every time
it's an easy question
best show every time
all right um
you are the best audience
every time
and uh there was one other thing that i
kept trying to remember to tell you but
i think it's gone now
so i'm going to say goodbye to youtube
i'm going to spend a few more minutes
with the locals people because they've
got a secret project i'm working on
and the rest of you don't know about it
so
i'll talk to you later
