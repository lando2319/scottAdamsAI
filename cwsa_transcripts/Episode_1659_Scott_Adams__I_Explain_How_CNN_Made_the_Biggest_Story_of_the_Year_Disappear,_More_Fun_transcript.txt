good morning everybody
and congratulations on finding your way
to the best thing that ever happened
it hasn't happened yet
but stick around
when it starts to happen you're going to
be sitting there saying to yourself
something very much like this
is this the best thing that's ever
happened
it is
it will be
and all you need is a copper magura
glass a tanker chelsea stein a candidate
jugger flask a vessel of any kind to get
it started fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee
black gold i call it
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine of the day it's the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen now to all of you all around the
world go
now i don't want to claim
that the simultaneous sip
could prevent
war with ukraine
but uh
whatever they're doing now isn't working
so
i'm just saying if you're doing a b
testing
put it in the mix
well here's some gigantic news
that is uh in disguise as small news
so sometimes the actual news that
matters is in technical publications
because you can see something coming
that's just enormous but the regular
press
doesn't quite see it yet you know like
crypto would have been so for several
years ago
well here's one of those stories
china starts up his first fourth
generation nuclear reactor
that this is this news is actually
so
outstandingly big right for those of you
who follow the industry
you're probably saying
what
i didn't even know that was close
now let me tell you why gen 4 is a big
deal so gen 4 would be different from
the current batch of nuclear reactors
and one what makes it different is
number one
it can't melt down
it can't
it's designed such that when things go
wrong
it just turns off
current ones have to have power to the
uh
you know power to the cooling
and if you lose the power the whole
thing melts down it's bad but with the
fourth generation if you lose your power
it just turns off
that's it and so the the the primary
risk
of having a nuclear facility is just
erased
number two
you can design these things and i think
they did it this way because it's the
only smart way to do it
to be modular
and standardized
what's the biggest problem with nuclear
power
getting it approved
and then the economics because it takes
longer to build it than you think it
will and it costs more and the cost
overruns and everything that's all
about old technology
so all the problems that we all we're
all familiar with them right it's like
if you tried to build a nuclear plant in
the united states
it's going to cause take 20 years to get
it you know built and approved it's
going to be
five times cost overrun
and then when you're done
people don't want to live near it
because they're afraid it's going to
melt down now i should say that the
current generation of you know the
generation three none of them have ever
melted down
by the way did you know that
did you know that the technology that we
build today if somebody is building a
nuclear power plant plant in france or
something
none of them have ever melted down now
they do have the potential
but we've learned so much from the
earlier generations that did melt down
you know the chernobyls and the
fukushimas and whatever
that we've learned so much by them that
the odds of a new one
melting down it's not zero
because you know
it's just technically possible
but
very very low to the point where it's
never happened zero it's never happened
so the generation four takes something
that's never happened in terms of a risk
and makes it even less
so
generation four is like such a crossover
point you know if you wait for things to
cross over well it just crossed over
it just crossed the hell over
i think
now we'll see how long it takes before
there are more fourth generation plants
coming up
in the united states there are a number
of startups that are working on the
fourth generation as well
so you make them a small modular
pre-approved
right if they're modular the government
just approves it once
it says okay that's the same one we
already approved just do it again the
economics drop because you're
standardized you're approved everything
it just fixes everything
climate change
fixed
fixed i mean fixed
to the extent that humans can do
something at this point
but this is a lot
all right we'll make too much of a big
deal about that
but if this were a sane world this would
be the biggest headline
by far it's the biggest thing happening
in the world right now it just doesn't
seem like it because if you're not
following this this topic
all right so purdue pharma the makers of
oxycontin
apparently they've offered to pay uh
six billion dollars to the victims of
u.s opioid
crisis
to which i ask myself
why isn't this the death penalty
like why do we even have a death penalty
if this isn't included
yeah the one who killed a million people
don't you think that addiction will kill
a million people you know it might take
10 years to do it or something
but
i know somewhere between 100 000 and a
million people
probably got killed
by
by something that they knew was
dangerous
so i i suppose that would always
you know be closer to the category of
manslaughter or something like that
but i i can't think of a worse crime
than this six billion
i don't know maybe not enough
have i ever told you that doing your own
research is the
most absurd thing that people do
and everybody says are you kidding
i did my own research and it worked out
great
you should always do your own research
it's the smartest thing to do
well here's some research that maybe you
did when you maybe you came across this
doing your own research
is research
this was tweeted by catherine
agnieva
agnianov
it says that they found they did a study
and they found that
the more people think they know about
coven vaccines the more likely they are
to believe misinformation
and then she goes on yes you read that
one right
people who say they are vaccine experts
are overwhelmingly more likely to hold
misperceptions
now in this context i believe a vaccine
expert
doesn't literally mean an expert i think
it means people who did their own
research to the point
where if you ask them they say you know
i've done so much research on this topic
i'm practically expert level
people who did their own research were
the most likely to be wrong
do you believe that
first of all do you believe that that
the study is telling you something
accurate now since this is exactly what
i've been telling you forever
that you can't do your own research it's
just an illusion
because you don't know if you did it
right
there's no standard by which
you can know if you did your own
research right
you can just feel you did it right
that's it
the whole reason that science exists
is because we easily convince ourselves
that we saw evidence that wasn't
actually what it was
that's the whole reason that science
exists
because humans absolutely
100 do not have
the ability to just sort of research
stuff and know it's true we just don't
have that ability
but boy do we think we do
now here's the other way to read this
what if you know maybe the survey is
just bad data right
most of the surveys and studies we've
seen in the last two years
at least somebody's going to say there's
something wrong with the methodology
so why would this be different
but the other thing is who gets to say
what's true about the vaccines ah
is that what you're going to say to me
you were going to say that right
what if
the people who did their own research
actually are the ones who are right
and then when the fact checkers go to
fact-check them they say
hey pfizer told us that you're wrong
about this
what does that mean it's wrong
in 2022
who's in charge of saying what's true
about vaccines
i don't recognize any authority of that
do you
seriously
who is your fact checker for what
vaccines do or do not do
there is none
is there
as far as i know there are just two
opinions you know
one opinion that is bad and one opinion
is good
but there's nobody that anybody would
recognize
as the opinion decider you know there's
no there's no supreme court
i still haven't seen the project veritas
video
and that's that's on me
and so if you if you want to criticize
me for that
totally valid
i promise you i'd look at the project
veritas video and once again i've seen i
haven't seen it
like nobody nobody tweeted it at me
since since you brought it up last time
anyway
so do your own research but
just know that there's a limit to what
people can do when they do their own
research
uh canada apparently uh is lost
my understanding is that all of the
trucks of the freedom convoy have been
towed away or they left
and everybody's been arrested or
chewed away
it's over right
is that is that correct or is it
only over in ottawa or something
it looks it looks like the
totalitarian canadian government
just went all
china and you know you
they're regrouping
a few dozens left well it looks to me
like i don't know if the energy has been
taken out of it because the government
you know isn't it interesting that there
is that video of
trudeau when asked what other countries
he
admired
he said and i agree with them by the way
that china because it's a dictatorship
they have some advantages
that's just true
oh and does anybody disagree with that
that i'm not saying it's better to have
a dictatorship you know all things
considered i'm saying that they have
some advantages they can turn on a dime
and they can just make people do stuff
and he actually said out loud in public
trudeau did
that he admired them for that ability
and then when he got in trouble
he did his emergencies act
and he basically just turned into a
dictator
and then he did what he had to do and it
actually worked
so
you can't say he's not clear-eyed
he told you exactly what he admired
and then when the situation called for
it he emulated what he admired
and it worked
i mean from his point of view while he
was trying to accomplish it worked
it looks like it
now
you know it was the dumbest part about
all of this
the dumbest part about all of this is
that this was negotiable wasn't it
am i wrong
wasn't this exactly the kind of thing
that's negotiable now i'm not saying
they should negotiate with the truck
drivers
because you know why should a government
negotiate with you know protesters per
se but they should listen to them and
they should at least negotiate with the
public
shouldn't they
you know shouldn't trudeau say look i i
hear the public
what we planned to do was x
but the but the public pushback matters
because we're that kind of a country
where if the public you know wants
something badly enough and they
understand the risks
that that does matter that has to be a
variable
why couldn't why couldn't trudeau have
said you know we planned to do this
until this date
but maybe we could talk about that date
and what we should look at is a certain
metric
and if this metric is reached let's say
a certain number of deaths or something
if this metric is reached then we can
move forward the the date of getting rid
of mandates
or
or is
is the
is the vaccine mandate one that can't be
moved they just it's just permanent
is it
i mean does it need to be
does a vaccine mandate need to be
permanent
i mean once the
omicron
rules and and it's you know closer to a
common cold
do you still need the mandates
or is that the only thing keeping it
under control they might say
i know
so don't you think that there's
something terribly missing
in this in in the canadian process which
i think ended
somewhat tragically
i'd have to say
somewhat tragically because i think the
canadian reputation is forever
stained
i think they they have a lot of division
in the public that wasn't necessary it
just wasn't necessary it was a
self-created uh problem
and
um
i know we should keep an eye on that and
try to see if we can learn anything from
it but uh
any
any government that won't tell you
they're flexible on moving a deadline
based on changes of the data or at least
tell you what what it would take for the
mandate to go away that's not a real
government is it
that just doesn't seem like governing
if it feels like a dictatorship
and i get that maybe judo thought he
needed to you know reopen commerce you
know i get that you know it's not it's
not a clean situation when you're the
leader he does have to balance the
interests of the people who just want to
go to work with the interests of the
people who are protesting and free
speech and all that so it's not easy
we should acknowledge that i guess
but he did have a choice of going full
dictator versus acting like he was at
least working with
the voices of the competing voices and i
don't think he acted like he was working
with him
and why is it that our leaders don't do
that
but why is it that our leaders just have
to say
i'm only going to do what my side wants
me to do
and that's all you can do now
that's all anybody can do is just say
there's just one side the other side
doesn't matter
by the way do you know who was
relatively good
at describing what the other side wanted
but that the person who came closest to
it was obama probably although i think
bill clinton maybe
but it's the strongest thing you can do
is acknowledge the other side and i
don't know why nobody does it
in fact i think trump should do it more
think how persuasive it is
to describe the other side's argument
before you describe your own
have you ever tried that
so here's your uh
persuasion tip for today
if you say here's my argument and you
ignore sort of the argument on the other
side you just give your own argument it
looks weak to me
and it looks like you're lying
to me
because if you've ignored the other the
other side's point well why have you
done that
if you can't deal with the other side's
point
you must be lying or you know your
argument is weak
if you have a real strong argument
and you should if you're a leader
you should be able to stand in front of
the people and say look
here's what my critics have said a b and
c and i have to admit that there's some
truth to all of that
but you have to weigh that against
you know d e and f
and in my judgment and based on all the
experts i've talked to
this is a bigger weight and a higher
priority
than these other things which i
acknowledge are really serious business
as well
but a leader has to pick
and uh you know with the understanding
that nobody can be nobody can make
everybody happy all the time
i'm gonna make a leadership decision
i understand all of your concerns and
i'm not forgetting them
but we got it we have to move forward
now
why can't anybody say that
wouldn't that be closer to exactly what
you want to hear
because lots of times you just want to
know you've been heard
and that
and that your your side of things is
respected
we never show respect for the other
argument
that's just a huge persuasion mistake
you should show
complete respect for the other argument
and if you can't destroy the other
argument
after fully and completely explaining it
saying that you respect it
giving it its full weight
if you can't if you can't beat that
argument well then you should have
accepted it
if you're afraid of the other team's
argument
maybe you should follow their argument
right
so i always think that's just one of the
biggest mistakes almost every politician
makes that mistake in my opinion
it's hard to think of anybody who
doesn't can you
can you think of anybody who does that
on a sort of a routine basis
give me a name of
anybody who who is in you know at the
top of the game
who gives credit to the other side's
argument
well jordan peterson and cernovich
they're not
they're not politicians i'm talking
about an elected politician
yeah
talker okay maybe
trump now
ben shapiro
um
i don't know about that but if anybody
did it would probably be him
um i guess i'd have to watch more of his
content to see some examples of that
tom cotton you think
i don't know
yeah
so
you you see how big the opportunity is
right
the the opportunity for somebody to be a
um
a uniter
it's just so easy
[Laughter]
it would be so easy
to actually get people on the other side
to vote for you
it would be really really easy
and the fact that nobody can figure out
how to do it
when it's it's roughly as easy as
falling out of a chair that's the level
of difficulty i just told you the whole
deal
just show some respect to the other side
that's it that's all you have to do to
get their votes
you have to be reasonable
show your work show respect to the other
side and then then move forward
people people you know i think maybe uh
i guess i just don't know why nobody
does that
okay
let's talk about ukraine
um
kamala harris is apparently taking the
lead
uh would you like to fill in your own
obvious jokes about this
um i'll wait
uh i'm going to have a sip of coffee
i'll need you to talk among yourselves
for a while
in the comments
please let loose with all of your best
kamla harris is in charge of the
integrity of ukraine's border
jokes
go
okay okay good good thank you
that went x-rated pretty quickly
now
let me ask you this
you know i don't want to go over woke
but isn't it sexist
that people make like sex
sex related jokes about
the vice president
am i wrong about that
good because i don't think i'm like the
most awoke person in the world or
anything
but that one
that one i kind of feel a little bit
that feels a little like well
i guess we did with bill clinton though
right yeah
and i guess we did it with eric swalwell
so yeah it's fair
okay my judgment is
i reassess my judgment and the judgment
is fair because it is actually evenly
applied when i think about it it's
evenly applied
all right here's my uh favorite story of
the day how cnn
made the durham filing
go away and the new york times is
working on this
this is amazing
now
in my in my uh
i'm watching your comments going by and
trying to keep my my train of thought
and
some of your comments are pretty funny
but i didn't want to call them out
because they're you know
sex jokes and they're gross
but they are funny
all right
so
you have to see the clip i wonder how
long it will take me to find this clip
of uh
stelter and who's the other guy
um on cnn talking about how the right
wing has stopped talking about the
false clinton story
and uh why the
so it's why the right-wing media stopped
covering the false clinton story
so now cnn is reporting
that the thing they ignored for days and
days and they got mocked for
now that they're not ignoring it
they're calling it fake news
and the reason that they're calling it
fake news will go into
but the report that is fake news is
fake news and so it's like the the
double fake news fake news
well we'll get into it
um so i tweeted it this morning so i
should see it at the top of my twitter
profile if i play it for you you have to
see their faces
when they
do what looks to me like
maybe not being
completely honest about this i'll see if
i can show this to you
come on
it's probably going to play a commercial
first
and
it's fascinating how it sits there and
doesn't play
or does it
you really have to you have to see these
guys faces i need a new wireless player
for my business but all my employees
need something i need to wait for the
commercial to go
so let me uh
let me give you uh the rundown of how
they make this go away
first of all they say that the claim
that was that trump was spied on
all right here it is or john berman i
think it is
well that's not exactly how the old
saying goes but it sure was on display
this week a story about the former
president and russian phones and all
sorts
so what i want you to look at
is the pained expressions on their faces
so it's going to be brian stelter
and
this gentleman
and i don't know if you've ever seen
so much torture in a face
because it looks to me like they know
they're lying
now
i don't know that right because i can't
read their minds i'm just telling you
the impression
their faces say
we know we're lying and we don't like it
but somebody told us to do this
it looks like something their boss told
them to do and it's going down like
they're chewing on a turd
but
just watch the
faces about hillary clinton and even the
death penalty but now poof the story has
mysteriously all but disappeared from
those right-wing outlets so what
happened wow chief media correspondent
brian stilter host of reliable sources
look at his face this is a complicated
story it's based off of an actual legal
filing but to get from there to here
what happened
there's always a little german truth
here a little germ of truth last week
with special counsel john durham who's
been investigating the origins of the
fbi's russia probe he submitted a vague
technical filing here's the cnn headline
about it saying special counsel durham
alleges clinton's campaign lawyer used
data to raise suspicions about trump
okay so a little bit of a story a germ
of a story but it was suddenly blown up
by right-wing media as if trump had been
proven right that he was spied on that
there was a crime of the century
trump really was spied on donald trump
himself said in a statement at a
stronger time in our history the death
penalty will be applied to the criminals
here this was trump as victim being
proven right even though that was not
true at all this went on for days and
days in right-wing media and so until
john started to fizzle
so then they go on but but let me let me
uh break down how they try to make this
story disappear it's really diabolical
so first he says there's a germ of truth
but that there wasn't spying basically
so here's how they they
they uh break it down
um
so first they debunked the claim
that the clinton campaign paid for the
data
all right
but that really wasn't important
the so so who paid for the data was
never really an important part
the the important part was
you know who got it
and so they make it sound as if the
since the data was not
um
since the data was not obtained by quote
spying
that that doesn't count as spying
and that the tech company wasn't who
they paid
but none of these are important to the
story
so the things that are debunking
are all the things that are sort of
tangential but not really terribly
important to the core of the story
but they make it act like the germ of
truth
isn't the important part no the germ of
truth is the whole story
that clinton
paid some lawyers
to go get some data
that they would use to frame trump
now the accusation in the durham
filing is that they knew they were
framing trump with fake data
that's the important part of the story
that the clinton campaign paid somebody
who got some data and that collectively
they knew it was fake data and they
tried to change the course of the
country
and the election by using fake data
but here's
watch how they dance around the the core
of the claim here
all right so first they go about who you
know how the data was obtained and who
paid to which was not terribly important
the the important part was that
they intentionally used fake data to try
to frame a guy who was running for
president
um
and then they say cnn claims that uh all
the data came from before the trump era
in other words before the trump
administration
so
so therefore the story is all fake right
because the data that was gathered
was before trump was even present
that's what they tell you here's what
they leave out
why in the world
was
uh
clinton's lawyer
asking only for obama-era information
and why would they use only obama-era
information
to frame trump
well either it included information from
trump tower which was before trump was
in power in which case it would be
completely relevant
right completely relevant to the story
because the fact they're trying to
prevent him from becoming president
so it's very relevant that it was an
obama era data because that's when they
were trying to prevent him from being
president
so they're they're acting they're acting
as if
the fact that they gathered the data
when he was running for president
isn't important
not only is it important it's the whole
 point
is that they were trying to prevent him
from becoming president that was the
whole point
so when they when they sell you that the
data was from a different presidency
that is complete misdirection
of course it was from the other
presidency because they were trying to
stop trump from being the president
all right
um
i mean the boldness of this is just
breathtaking
um and then how do we know that all the
data was from the uh obama
administration how do we know that
did john durham tell us that
based on sources that were probably
under oath
nope nope it came from a guy
who was involved in gathering the data a
guy not under oath
a guy not under oath
says that the story is is fake
but he wasn't even talking about the
right thing when he said that
okay
um
so cnn never never directly debunked the
main claim
the the heart of the story is that the
clinton campaign used fake data
obtained through the lawyers that they
paid
to intentionally frame trump and change
the course of
history
like that didn't count
no no what counts is
who paid for the data no that didn't
matter that was completely irrelevant
um
yeah and then
then the cnn uses uh points the new york
times with the
its old news trick
so they try to use the trick the new
york times
by saying no no this is an old story
but it's not
because it was never an old story
that durham just filed
in other words the fact that durham
filed the story
means that some credibility has been
added as well as the whole narrative of
why it was happening
but
the way the new york times tells the
story is
we already knew
there was some sketchy data suggesting
trump was communicating with russia
so they say this is an old story
but when they say it's an old story what
they're talking about is not the true
part of the story
they're talking about the fake part
yes the fake part of the story was
reported before the fake part
the fake part where that data meant
something that's the part they reported
they reported the fake part and now they
say well that's old news because we
reported it no you didn't
you reported the fake part you never
reported the real part or the alleged
real part that's in the filing
but if you didn't do what i did i did my
own research because you know that works
pretty well pretty well
if you didn't do what i did which is you
know hunt down these links and read them
and try to understand the whole thing
you would think
by listening to cnn or reading the new
york times
you would think
that the story went away
and that never happened
i mean the the people on the right did
stop talking about it but because there
was nothing else to say it just sort of
ran its course there were there was no
new information
now you tell me
is it not completely obvious to you
that the clinton campaign and the
democrats have colluded with the cnn and
the new york times and msnbc directly
colluded as in actual conversations
not just
not just knowing what everybody should
do but actually having conversations
to make the story go away
is this not obviously a coordinated
change of the narrative
it is right it's very obvious
and all of these people involved with
this have outed themselves as
democrat operatives
haven't they
so you should watch a story like this
and then you know remember the names
involved
because these these are the ones you can
never trust again
you can never trust anybody involved in
these stories again
no matter what they ever say in the
future just remember they said this
they made the biggest story the last 10
years go away
intentionally obviously
so
that to me is amazing and it's further
amazing that you succeeded
because you know some
some people like me will talk about it
but that's it it's kind of done and by
and if and if this live stream got any
you know viral pickup
if this started to trend and it's not it
won't but if it did
do you know what would happen
somebody would write a fake story about
me
and they would say it's a complicated
story
but what you have to understand is the
cartoonist doesn't realize
that the data came from before trump was
even president
and then all the people who listened to
would say
i can't believe he didn't even do his
research the most basic thing
of when did the data even belong to
the cartoonist do not listen to him he's
an idiot
and anybody who saw that criticism would
believe it was a valid criticism
they wouldn't know
that the criticism actually made no
sense
you wouldn't know that the criticism
would sound way more credible
than a clip of me talking
that wouldn't even be close
right especially if you know some
credible organization said it
so just think about it just the ability
um
i am i am actually i do subscribe to
project veritas but uh somebody asked me
if i'm if i subscribe to it i do
subscribe so i get the emails but my
email is
is just a rat's nest so you can't really
i don't really find things in my email
that's not a thing for me
um
yeah
i i i i feel like
can i make you a promise
or a prediction i guess so here's a
prediction slash promise
it's very likely
in the next year
you're going to hear some terrible
things about me
does anybody think so
does anybody think you're going to hear
some terrible things about me in the
next year
i can pretty much guarantee it
now
here's my promise to you
if it's funny
i'm not going to deny it
i want you to hear this clearly
if you hear anything about me
that's just some wild accusation
if it's funny
i'm not going to deny it
because
i'm a great fan of richard gere
do you remember the richard gere story
if you're a certain age you'd remember
this story so actor richard gere
allegedly
there was a story that he stuck a gerbil
up his rectum and had to go to the
hospital to get it out
and it was you know related to some
strange sex practice or something
and
the best part of the story
by far the best part of the story is he
never denied it
now personally i don't think there's any
chance is true i mean i think there's
zero chances too zero
but the fact that he wouldn't deny it
just made me love him forever like i
just love that and i
and i think it might be related to his
philosophical journey you know he's a
he was a
was he
zen buddhist or something i don't know
but but i think he just sort of accepted
it as
as just part of his
part of his life now
so if yuri did anything illegal i'm sure
it's untrue
but if here i did anything with a gerbil
i encourage you to believe it if it's
the most entertaining thing that
happened that day
all right and that is all i have for
today
and uh
go forth and uh
prosper
it's kind of early should i stay and
answer some questions oh i should tell
you that i if you don't know it i put
another micro lesson on the locals
subscription
sites i've got over 200 of them now
and each of them is you know two to four
minutes to teach you an actual life
skill
you know something that could actually
make a big difference in your life and i
try to do it in two to four minutes now
most of them are
persuasion based so i'm either reframing
something to get a quick
a quick advantage
that sort of thing
oh ukraine
did i miss my ukraine notes
oh
um
yeah let me talk about ukraine a little
bit more
so kabul harris is there and uh
you know that's terrific
but
nato is all unified
now here's the thing i'm not sure that
putin realizes and i tweeted this
earlier
i'm not sure that putin realizes
that if he were to take ukraine in a in
a bloodbath
that
everybody would see that as a hitler
version 2.0
you wonder if he sees that right
because
you know
russia has this weird
kind of role where they're you know
putin is an evil murderer but on the
other hand people sort of like him
am i right
putin has the weirdest reputation of any
dictator
oh he's definitely a brutal murderer
ah but he's kind of cool too
also
i don't know anybody else who's ever
pulled that off
am i right there's nobody who's ever
pulled that off ever
brutal murder yeah can we do lunch
sure
all right
and we'll invite you over to the u.n
well you know he just brutally murdered
some critics yeah you know
but also he's kind of cool
who else could pull that off and i'm not
praising him
i'm just
i'm just amazed that anybody could do
that how the hell did he do that
so
i don't i don't know that he realizes
that that's all at risk now because if
he does to ukraine what he's threatening
to do or it looks like he's going to do
that just turns him into hitler
and at that point the world is going to
turn russia into north korea
meaning that he's about a week away from
having north korea's economy
because i think the world will just shut
him down
now he can sell fuel to china
but how happy would putin be if his only
customer is china
how how happy would you be
if you became china's
not happy
not happy
because china would own him at that
point
because china can get fuel from other
places
but
what if russia can only sell to one
place
you know what i mean
if they can only sell to one place
and their entire economy will depend on
them selling to that one place
that one place owns them
that's when the customer owns the seller
he doesn't want to be in that position
so the position that
he's a week away from is a north korea
complete economic isolation
and i don't i don't know if he sees that
coming or not who knows what he's
thinking right we know he's smart
so he should see it coming
but he's acting like he doesn't
so i'm still going to keep with my
prediction
that he's bluffing
now i realize how
unlikely that seems because he's showing
every sign of invasion
according to our intel but you know our
intel are all liars right
you know that our intel
uh our intel can't be trusted
so what what the united states is
telling us about that situation
you should not trust at all
at all
am i right
is there anybody who would trust u.s
intelligence
what is telling
would anybody
at this point
no that's what we've learned so we don't
really have any information that would
reliably tell us there's going to be an
invasion
and
and you have to wonder why ukraine is
acting the other way
now i think
this is what might be going on
i think
ukraine and
zelinski
i think zelinski might be playing good
cop to biden's bad cop
and it might be intentional
because think of what think of the
the
small
window that they have to fit through
you've got to be ready for war
but not lose automatically by panicking
and shutting down your whole country
so ukraine needs to be business as usual
until it can't
because if they can't be business as
usual then they've already lost right
then russia basically will control
ukraine just by threatening them
so if the threat alone is as effective
as the war
then ukraine loses if they accept the
threat as real so it could be
that ukraine is playing good cop bad cop
so that biden can do can you know say
the scary stuff
zelensky can tell his public to stay
cool
keep the economy running keep everybody
fed
as long as possible because maybe
there's just nothing you can do about it
what's he going to do
if they're afraid that kiev will be
bombed should they
drain the city
if they do then russia already won
right
if the civilians leave then russia
already won
they just oh well everybody's gone let's
go take that city
so
it could be that the reason that ukraine
and the united states have almost
opposite messages is that it's
intentional
could be completely intentional
that they both know that the other one
is going to be you know the bad cop and
one's a good cop
can you see any other way that it would
be smart to play it
because it could be that zelinski also
thinks that the
the attack is coming
but if he says it
his public will panic
if biden says it and zielinski doesn't
then they get the best of both worlds
which is i hate to say it
but the people who stay in the cities
and just work
they're human shields
because if putin bombs a populated city
that's just business as usual
he is hitler
and that never will change
because it's not it's not like bombing
chechnya
like frankly that was sort of off the
grid a little bit for a lot of people
but we're watching kiev
he's not going to be able to bomb a
bunch of peaceful citizens and level a
city
minding its own business i mean the city
itself is minding its own business he's
not going to get away with that
so in some ways zielinski is keeping the
city populated because they're human
shields
it makes it
effectively impossible for
russia to attack
and it's kind of clever
so where at first i was thinking there's
some kind of massive incompetence going
on here
that ukraine is saying the opposite of
what biden is saying i was like this is
really messed up there's something wrong
here
what's going on are they not sharing the
intel
what's broken
but the longer this goes the more i
think that's intentional and it's a good
cop bad cop set up
does anybody disagree
so once i describe it this way
you can see that any other action would
have been worse
if zolensky had panicked
they would have already lost
because they would have shown that
russia can just threaten them into
closing down their own country
that would be losing
right
if he drains the city
then russia can just walk in and take it
and they don't even kill any civilians
that's the ideal situation
so i think
this is a game of brinksmanship like
we've never seen before
now let me finish my
uh predictions
i think that putin probably is smart
enough to know
that if he bombs a civilian city a
vibrant
civilian city
that is minding its own business
the city itself is
uh that his economy will never recover
from that never and i think he knows it
wouldn't you know it
don't don't you think that the show of
solidarity from nato
and and just the
i guess the
hugeness of the situation
really does suggest that we would close
his economy forever
i and like actually forever
at least as long as putin's alive
all right i think we would have closed
his economy forever and then what
then what problem does uh putin have
instantly
don't you think that putin has to keep
the uh
the all the oligopolists
rich
don't you think that the billionaires in
russia are sort of like
you know almost like the shadow
government
if the billionaires lose all of their
money
how long does putin remain in power
now we assume that putin owns the
billionaires not the other way around
but if the billionaires start losing all
of their money because of putin
they're going to take him out
they will
because billionaires aren't going to sit
by while they lose all of their money
that's not going to happen
they're going to take him out
and i think he knows that or at least
they try
so i think
that putin's trying to get as much as he
can by frightening ukraine
and ukraine might be
playing the smartest psychological game
i've ever seen
or they're just dumb and they don't have
good intel
both totally possible right now
based on what we're seeing
this is either brilliant
or really incompetent
would you agree those are the only two
choices
given the difference in what ukraine is
saying versus biden
it is only
massive incompetence
or super smart
super smart
so does anybody have a like a third
option
i'm open to a third option
um
ukraine is not one country i think
that's a good
that's a good observation ukraine is not
like one country so there's probably
some kind of a partial
annexation or control or something
that's going to happen right
so i'm going to i'm going to say that
putin is not going to do a full-scale
military takeover of the entire country
of ukraine
that's still my prediction i think that
uh making it look in every way like he
is going to do it is just part of the
persuasion
but that if he did it he could never
survive the hitler 2.0
the economy would be crashed
so that is my prediction and uh but that
doesn't mean he wouldn't i don't
try to get some control over
some key part that's already russian
speaking
scott you're reading far too much into a
make-believe situation well i think my
whole point was that
it's make-believe
uh doesn't that make biden look dumb if
he calls an invasion imminent and it
doesn't happen nope
no because biden has the entire
mainstream media to say what i'm going
to say right now
how clever it was
for biden to play bad cop
right
it's easy you just say he cleverly
played bad cop
until and and by the way
let me add this
we are are we not seeing the fake flag
attempts that
blinken and biden told us we would see
aren't we seeing him exactly the way
they called it out
i think that was really smart
i think trump would have done the same
thing actually so
but
wasn't that smart
because we are seeing the fake flags and
everybody's going oh there's that fake
flag you talked about false flag
right i feel like that was actually
a really strong play by the
administration i give them credit for
that
yeah
i don't know
i i'm not going to rule out the
possibility
that something smart is happening but i
will tell you in my opinion trump would
have handled this without this fuss
i think trump would have handled it in
some better way i don't know what that
would have been but i don't think he
would have taken such a traditional path
because he never does
um
yeah all right well that's all i got for
now i don't think i forgot anything else
but i'll go look at that
project veritas video
and i'll try not to forget this time and
i will talk to you
tomorrow
