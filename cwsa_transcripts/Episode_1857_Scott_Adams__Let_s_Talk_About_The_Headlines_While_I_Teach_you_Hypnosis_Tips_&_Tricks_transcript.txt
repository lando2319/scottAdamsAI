good morning everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with scott adams and i
don't think there's been a finer moment
in the history of
time
space time
or whatever the hell this is
and you
my lucky viewers
are in for
the best time of your entire day so far
and all you need to take it up to
amazing levels of happiness is a copper
margaret glass a tanker chelsea steiner
canteen joker flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine the other day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and wait do you feel it it's amazing
go
well today
we're going to peel back
the scenery
and take a look at
the machinery
that's right
we're gonna we're gonna go deep
we're gonna look behind the curtain
under the hood
beneath the rock
and then we're going to drill into the
core of the planet
to find secrets
and truths
that have never been experienced before
or we'll just spend an hour or so
sipping coffee and having a good time
and both of those are good things i
think you'd agree
well in the news here are the things we
know for sure
long coveted definitely exists
and it's really bad
we also know there's no evidence
whatsoever that long covet exists
so those those are both true
we know for example that emergency rooms
are packed with people
complaining of long-covered symptoms
i also know because i saw a bunch of
emergency room doctors this morning say
there's absolutely nothing like that
happening
i've seen exactly zero long-covered
patients
say the other emergency room doctors
so it is totally true that long covet is
a gigantic problem that exists for
millions of people and is one of the
biggest variables in the entire pandemic
and also
there's no evidence of it whatsoever
so you can
choose your adventure which one of those
do you like
there is just as much evidence of both
the situations
just as much
i i don't know which one's true honestly
i don't
also in the news we have new studies
that have proven that new data proven
that vaccinations are injuring people
more than the uh
more than the covenant itself but but
hold on don't cancel me yet
but also information proving the
opposite
so we simultaneously have really good
solid information
that the vaccinations have saved
millions of lives
and at the same time
really solid information that killed
people
both true
they're both equally true
meaning that they both have
something like
data
and there are people who believe each
now the experts are solidly on one side
on most of these questions
but do you believe the experts anymore
well
well
we want to
we'd like to
wouldn't it be nice if we could
let's see what else we know um
uh we also know this week that
ivermecton definitely works because
there's a new study showing it and also
that ivermectin definitely doesn't work
because there are better studies that
show that it doesn't work and an
observational study doesn't mean
anything
so these are the things we know long
covet exists and doesn't exist
vaccinations are good for you and not
good for you and that ivormectin totally
works and totally doesn't work
that was that's the news today
now
how much of this do you think is because
the people who disagree with you
didn't do their homework
you think that's what's going on
do you think the people who are on the
other side from you wherever you are on
these topics do you think that it's
because they don't have better they
don't have good information
you think that's a problem
well we're going to get to that
here's another other thing that uh is
true and not true at the same time
trump's recent speech
was super divisive
or the opposite of that
just a lot of fun
so it's both of those things it was
super divisive divisive nazi sounding
scary
and also just a bunch of laughs
same time
both of those we're all looking at the
same stuff
everybody's looking at the same stuff
um
we also know that biden has been
simultaneously hugely successful
lots of major legislation you know he's
got the
unemployment rate is not bad and things
are moving in the right direction
at the same time everything he's done is
a disaster
so biden is simultaneously one of the
most successful presidents in our
history and also the worst president in
our history
same time
yeah same time
um
so let me ask you this
uh
today for the first time
it's sort of sort of not a good sign uh
years ago when i built my house the one
i live in i put it in an elevator
because i said to myself if i stay here
long enough
eventually there's going to be a day
when i don't want to walk upstairs
and so i put in an elevator
i didn't think that day would be today
but it is
this morning i actually couldn't handle
the stairs
it was physically too much for me
now here's the weird thing
i'm in really good shape
i'm in great shape
right physically i can you know i walk
for miles ride my bike for miles go to
the gym on a regular basis but i can't
walk up and down my stairs anymore do
you know why
do you know why i can't walk up and down
my stairs anymore
i don't know either
i don't know
if if i were going to fall for the long
covent story
that's exactly what it feels like
it feels exactly like long covet because
here's what the feeling is
all of my muscles hurt like crazy all of
the time
and i thought i was just working out too
much
so that i took a little time off from my
workouts to just see if maybe i just
overdid it
no difference
my muscles are sore all the time
i can barely walk up and down stairs
now by
by mid-morning
by mid-morning i will have loosened up a
little bit and i i could walk up and
downstairs easily i can run up and down
six so by this afternoon
i'll be fine
later in the afternoon i will again be
so tired that i will just sit on the
couch and stare into space
now you're going to say to yourself it's
old age
except that it happened at the same time
i
is that got
coincidence did old age just sneak up on
me or the same week i got covered
did that happen
and and were my exact covenant symptoms
is it just a coincidence that the exact
symptoms i had during covert which is
trouble walking up the stairs
are the same symptoms i have now
trouble walking up and down the stairs
now
when did i get my vaccination you're all
desperate to find out aren't you
well i only got the original series for
the alpha
so that was over a year ago
i did not get a booster beyond the the
first
two that were basically one shot but two
parts
so i didn't get anything beyond the
first
the first set
a year went by
when i didn't really have this problem
as soon as i got covered
i haven't been able to walk upstairs for
two months now
two months
now
and then i also have the brain fog for a
while but that's
i have less of the brain fog right now
now here's another factoid see if you
can figure this out
all right
when when i'm completely wiped out and i
can't even move
i could just barely stand up and get to
my car and i mean it's a struggle
i mean just in
i mean at three o'clock in the afternoon
the act of standing up
walking to my garage and putting the key
in the it's actually pretty hard
it's pretty hard it's a struggle
then i go to starbucks
and i order a vente sized iced
espresso
almond milk something i don't know what
it is
i sit there and i drink that espresso
almond milk iced tea whatever whatever
ice thing it is and when i'm done i feel
fine
like i i want to go to the gym
my body's all great
pain is gone
yeah i want to go work i i want to work
on my book for hours
now here's here's the weird part
if i drink warm coffee at home
it just puts me to sleep
what's the difference
does anybody know
is it the sugar because i don't have
sugar in my coffee when i'm home i just
need to have black coffee
but what i have in a starbucks is i
assume it's got sugar in there of some
kind
you think it's the sugar
do you think i
it's the sunlight no i you know the
other thing i've been doing is uh going
out in the morning and standing in the
sun for a few minutes every day
i've been hearing good things about that
like just the first thing i do as soon
as i'm done with this i'll actually go
stand in my driveway for 10 minutes and
just feel the sun
yeah now you're also going to say it's
because of marijuana right
right
yeah the obvious things
but my marijuana smoking is identical to
how it's been
since i was
18 years old
hasn't changed that much and it's not
like the the weed got better this summer
i mean it's gradually improved but
that's not it
i i know exactly what it feels like to
be stoned
and this is different very different
now somebody said take a nap
uh i've tried that of course
and then i wake up from the nap and uh
my muscles are still sore
so the nap doesn't help the muscles
so here's the thing do i have long coved
if you were to say scott you've never
learned anything about psychology or
confirmation bias
tell us do you think you have long
coveted and i'd say well i've never
heard of those things you just mentioned
i definitely have long coveted
but then suppose you said scott
you've been studying this stuff for a
long time you know what confirmation
bias is
you know what it is you know what
cognitive dissonance is
now
do you think you have long covert
and then i say oh i do know what
those things mean
i don't know
not only do i don't know i don't even
have a good guess
i'm not even sure which would be
slightly more likely
no idea
but if you think that you're a sure
in my exact situation
if you could be in my exact situation
and you would say to yourself
i'm sure i'm sure this is long covered
then you haven't learned your lesson yet
and you will learn this lesson by the
end of this live stream oh there's more
to come
watch me tie it all together in one
beautiful souffle
yeah you don't see it yet but it's
coming together
all right um
i saw a tweet from pd mangan today who's
a good follow
pd
mangan m-a-n-g-a-n
um
shows that 25 of women in the united
states are on an antidepressant
25 percent of adult women are on an
antidepressant in the united states
so i saw separately another tweet that
said the united states rate of
antidepressants
is through the roof compared to other
countries
surprised
i'm not surprised
do you know what is different about the
united states compared to all those
other countries
where they have fewer
prescriptions for antidepressants
well i don't know this is true so i'll
ask you for a fact check
is it true that the united states is the
only place that those companies can
advertise directly to consumers
because you you see advertisements
directly to consumers don't you think
that makes the consumers ask for it
and that's why they do it the whole
point of it is to make consumers ask for
it
so
do you think that the united states has
a much bigger problem with depression
or do we have a big problem with media
manipulation and brainwashing by
advertisement
which problem do we have
maybe both
yeah maybe a little bit of both
it's hard to know how much of each
um
but does that number sound right to you
let me just just test it
commonsensically right so here's one of
your filters
if if the thing that science is telling
you
doesn't map with what you're observing
that doesn't mean it's not true because
your observations might be biased
but if it doesn't match you should at
least raise a flag and say okay there's
a little discrepancy here
why is my observation so wildly
different than what i'm seeing
what is your opinion of the 25 of adult
women on antidepressants
higher low is a higher low go
or just right high or low
yeah it's low
almost everybody says it's low there's a
few high
a few say high most people think it's
low
yeah
why is that
why is that
well
here's my take
i think that society is organized in a
way that prevents us from achieving
happiness
now i say society i mean everything from
the way we use technology to the way we
get married to the way we have
relationships to the way we raise kids
to the way our school system works just
everything
just all of it
is designed
not designed
it sort of evolved that way
but we have created a civilization that
couldn't possibly satisfy its people
am i right
if you took those same people and you
know just airlifted them and dropped
them into another environment
let's say you just put them in another
country where people are happier i don't
know where that is
name a happy country
what's a happy country
uh south korea
poland albonia tahiti i don't know
finland
i don't know
wherever wherever they're happy
do you think those people would be
happier if you dropped them in a happier
place with a different civilization
maybe
i don't know
maybe
um
but to me the 25 seems super low because
what's not included is the number of
people self-medicating
how many people are taking illegal pills
that's not in here right don't you think
there are just a done of people who
are taking uh an illegal xanax or an
illegal
adderall or an illegal something
and that they're doing it to feel better
and in other words it's an
antidepressant of sorts
yeah overeating you could say overeating
is a is an antidepressant
it's a very bad one
this date is from 2014.
so imagine what the rate of
antidepressants is now
after the pandemic
yeah so you got to throw in alcohol you
got to throw in weed legal weed you got
to throw all that in there i think it's
closer to 80 percent
my guess is that 80 percent of adults
male and female
are
are actively
medicating
80
and the other 20 percent wish they had
but that's another story
um
what do you think what would be your
guess
as to the popularity of abortion
having it legalized anyway
what will happen if you make it uh
well what what do you think was the
predictable outcome of the supreme court
all right the supreme court said it's up
to the states to decide but what do you
think the public
on average did
did the public move more pro-abortion
or more anti-abortion abortion
what happened and and what was
predictable
what was the predictable outcome
see neither in both
no change negligible
confusion
all right let's apply what we've learned
from
let's apply everything we've learned
from persuasion okay
what happened when the supreme court
ruled on roe
what did it do to the supply
of abortions of legal abortions what
happened to the supply of legal
abortions it went down right
you could still get them but you'd have
to work harder and go somewhere else in
some cases
so if the supply goes down
what does that do to the price
it goes up
it goes up right when the supply is down
but the demand the demand stays high
then the price goes up
now price is another way to say
value
right roughly roughly their
proxies
so it's not surprising to me that when
you make something harder to get
like
like a luxury good
that people have a higher opinion of it
it could be
that just restricting the supply makes
people want it more
and and by the way you would expect that
right because everything we know about
restricted supply
changes the psychology of how valuable
it is to say oh these are hard to get
if they're hard to get they must be
valuable
am i wrong
just the fact that they're hard to get
makes it
seem more valuable
like you'd be a little more desperate to
get it if it were hard to get
and also i think the supreme court
decision made people think about
themselves or their loved ones in that
situation
if it's not in the headlines you don't
have to think about yourself or what if
this happens to me
but as soon as you think what if it
happens to me or my loved ones
suddenly you say to yourself i think i
want options
right
if if you're forced to think about it in
terms of your personal experience you're
gonna you're gonna lean toward at least
having options
so it doesn't surprise me at all that
there's a survey that says
that legal abortion went up in
popularity
so i don't know if i wouldn't
necessarily say that one survey is
conclusive
but it wouldn't be surprising
that's actually the way if you
understood persuasion
you would kind of expect it to get more
popular because it's restricted
now
to test my theory what about cigarette
smoking
cigarette smoking is actually way down
compared to what it used to be it's like
10 or 11 percent of the public smokes
now i think it used to be at least a
third or a half or something like that
it was crazy at one point
so your smoking was restricted
in a sense
but
popularity went down
but it wasn't really restricted was it
because anybody underage could always
get his cigarettes any time they wanted
so it wasn't really restricted not in
any serious way
yeah and then the vape was more
available
right
so i'm not sure that's a good good
example but
all right have you ever heard of the
festinger cognitive dissonance
experiment probably not
let me tell you about it
here's what to take away from this
experiment i'm going to describe
uh first of all this is repeatable
so you you could do this experiment all
day long and you would get the same
result
so that's unusual and wonderful that is
repeatable
and it works like this you ask a bunch
of volunteers
to do a boring task
they're just like piling up blocks or
something it's just super boring
and then at the end of it
you uh you offer them either twenty
dollars or one dollar back when twenty
dollars was worth more than it is now
you'd offer them either twenty dollars
or one dollar
and they wouldn't know that people were
getting different offers
that would be secret
and you'd say i want you to tell the
people in the other room that this was
actually a fun and exciting task
you know lie to them in other words
because everybody believed it was boring
but they were both groups were asked to
lie
so the people who were paid twenty
dollars to lie
lied because they were asked to
and
then later when they were asked their
opinion about the blocks it was about
the same as it was before
they thought it was boring before they
lied and said it wasn't boring they got
twenty dollars
and later they still thought it was
boring so their opinion was unchanged
the people who were offered one dollar
also lied because they were asked to
but when they checked with them later
the one dollar people
had
by a large percentage like 30 some
percent or so
had decided that it was actually not
that boring they'd actually convince
themselves it was interesting
about a third of them
do you know why
and there's a solid hypothesis behind it
that can be reproduced at will
and the and the thing is that the 20
people
thought that the reason that they were
lying was they were being paid for it
oh you're asking me to lie i got 20
that's serious money in those days
so
i know i'm lying i'm just getting paid
for it
the people who got one dollar one dollar
wasn't enough to lie
most people will not lie for a dollar
so when they lied
for a dollar
they had to explain it later to
themselves and the way they explained it
was well it wasn't really lying
because it actually was more fun than
maybe i first thought it was you know it
was actually kind of it was interesting
really actually i enjoyed it a lot i got
i was alone with my thoughts and it was
very it was a good time
now here's what you should learn from
this
these people's brains were rewired for
a dollar
instantly
or nearly instantly you know we're
talking about within hours or days
one dollar
rewired a third of the people there
instantly
one dollar
all they did was get somebody to say
something that was opposite of what they
believed and they would and a third of
them talk themselves into it within a
day
okay now
is that experiment does it blow your
mind
that is so powerful cognitive dissonance
and that it's so easy to trigger it
does it blow your mind
it doesn't blow mine because this is
something i've known for decades right
these these studies have been
you know replicated for decades
once you understand how powerful this is
then everything you see in politics and
social media starts making sense
so part of the reason that i can i can
withstand social media silliness
and it doesn't make me crazy
relative to other people
everybody gets a little crazy
is because i see it this way
i see it as people literally walking
around in a fog and not knowing it
if i saw them as like legitimate players
who were mad at me or had like a real
opinion of me that was low maybe it'd
bother me i don't know but i don't see
the world that way
i see it as people just literally blind
and just bumping into stuff and i'm like
oh just stand out of the way
let you let you blind people bump into
stuff just just stand back a little bit
and let it happen that's how i see the
world i see social media as blind people
bumping
into stuff
i don't see them as having
even real opinions
i mean i literally don't think their
opinions are even real
it's just something they heard it was
assigned to them by the media
somebody paid him a dollar and it
reversed
but everything's like that
everything
as soon as you think well
those poor poor bastards
i'm sure glad that doesn't happen to me
huh
aren't we happy that that doesn't happen
to us it only happens to other people
no
no
no it happens to you
and you don't know when it happens to
you that's the nature of it the nature
of it is you can only see it in other
people
that's why you have the illusion that
it's only happening to other people
but they can see it in you
but it gets worse than that
most of the time when they see it in you
they're projecting
well i don't know if it's most of the
time it would depend who you are
but
you can't tell the difference between
when they really see some inconsistency
inconsistency with what you're doing and
whether they are experiencing just more
cognitive dissonance
and so they imagine you're the one who's
with the problem
you can't tell
can't tell that's what makes it exciting
now i have told you there's one you know
there are a few little signals
you you look for the person who's got
the trigger
right now if you if you've not been
triggered for example when i heard about
this uh study
i said to myself oh that's exactly what
i expected
you know i would have predicted this
exact outcome based on what i know so
that's no there's no trigger for
cognitive dissonance in my case
because what i expected is exactly what
happened
but if what you expect you learn to be
completely wrong that's when cognitive
dissonance kicks in so that's your
trigger look for somebody who found out
that what they believed was totally
wrong
those are the ones who are triggered but
we even agree about disagree about
what's right and what's wrong so even
that stuff
all right
um
david frum do you all know him political
commentator and writer
and he's a big anti-trumper
and
here's how he describes uh trump's
um i'm sorry not trump's biden's speech
the one that people called
uh
satanic
all right so many of you probably said
to yourself that biden speech was the
worst thing that ever happened
there's no way you can spin that good
well interestingly
david frum writing in the atlantic
which if you don't know the atlantic is
not a serious
publication
it's owned by i believe it's owned by
steve jobs's widow right
and
it's just a democrat publication
trying to pretend it's not
but
here's what uh from titled his piece
he said biden laid the trap trump walked
into it
so frum's take on this
is that biden is so clever that he was
laying a trap with this rally
to try to provoke
the trumpists into acting crazy
and thus prove that they are crazy
so this was not an old man doddering
through a completely failed attempt at
communicating
that's what many of you think you saw no
no
you were mistaken
this was biden cleverly laying a trap
and trump just walked right into that
trap he did
but here's the way
from described this in a tweet so he
tweeted this
he said early in trump's term an
anonymous staffer said something like
quote
trump's not playing three-dimensional
chess
most of the time we're just trying to
stop him from eating the pieces
um
and then he he says that biden's speech
go to trump into swallowing at least a
bishop
now here's your next
hypnosis tip
and i'm not making this up
this is something i specifically learned
in hypnosis class
so my hypnosis instructor taught me this
and it's one of the most useful things
i've ever learned
you won't believe this is true
and so you'll have the same experience i
did the first time i heard it like i
don't think that's true and then you you
watch for it
and every year that goes by you're like
oh
it might be a little bit true
and then eventually you're like
damn it
damn it
it's true
it goes like this
people tell you their sexual preferences
in direct words
you just don't notice
it's just that your sexual instrument is
such a strong part of your being
that your language just naturally wraps
around those preferences whether you
know it or not
you can't turn it off
so when david frum who is a big nemesis
of president trump
writes biden's speech go to trump into
swallowing at least a bishop
my hypnosis instructor would say
that is not a coincidental use of terms
that's a man who has fantasies of
blowing president trump
now
i'm not going to say that that's true
because that would require my mind
reading right
i'm saying that's what i learned in
hypnosis
and that whenever whenever i noticed
something like this
and i could follow up and find out if it
were true
it was true
so all of the times when i could confirm
whether the thing i was hearing i think
i heard something very sexual
anytime i could confirm whether or not
it was true it was always true
it was exactly what it looked like
now
i have no way to confirm this one
i'm just telling you the pattern i've
noticed through my life is that it's not
a coincidence
nobody could write you swallow the
bishop
without
feeling there's some kind of sexual
connotation there
really swallow the bishop
uh hypnotist interpretation of this was
that is that david from
um
sexual psetomastic
feeling about trump
which by the way is probably common
are there any women watching this who
have had sexual uh dreams about trump
go
any women
who have had sexual dreams about trump
because for a while that was a thing
you know maybe before his first election
all right i see one yes
my wife yes
mo is mostly knows
but you see a sprinkling of yes right
i assume it was mostly now
i know to the dead right so i've heard
i've heard of people who did as well so
it's not unusual to have sexual
fantasies about a president or anybody
in power
anyway that's what i see in this
what else is going on what a fun day
all right what about those top secret
folders so here's a question i asked and
doesn't this amaze you that we don't
have to answer this
i'll say this again
i feel that there's a missing service in
the news industry and the missing
service
is that the
citizens should have a place they can go
where they can say this is the question
i'd like to have answered
from my government
and then the news people would be able
to look at the list and say okay this is
what people wonder about
so i will ask their questions plus my
own good questions but it'll be nice to
know what the public wants to know
and the number of times that the press
simply doesn't ask the question that the
public wants to know
is really astounding isn't it
and you don't always notice
but really the reason that the questions
they ask are asked is why
why why does anybody
why do the press people ask the specific
questions they ask
what is their motivation for the
questions they ask
yeah it's all gotcha questions right
it's gotchas or it's trying to make the
person look good
it could go either way
but more importantly it's for the
reporter's career
right the journalist is trying to make
the journalists look good
that's the motivation
you know all the other motivations are
are subsidiary to that the top
motivation is for the journalists to
look good because it's a you know career
defining moment
so that's all that matters
so
under that situation
um
what do you think of those blank top
secret folders that were found at
mar-a-lago so a bunch of empty
top-secret folders
and here's the question that i've not
seen anybody ask
so this is why we need that website to
ask these questions
how normal is it for a president's
office to have extra top secret folders
in case you need one
i would think that they'd be laying
around
readily available
would they not
because it seems to me there are things
that probably enter the
oval office
and probably get
re-re-characterized on the fly don't
they
don't you think there are some things
that come in and they're marked top
secret and then the president looks at
it and says all right this doesn't
really need to be top secret and just
throws away the folder or just tosses it
on the desk
has that ever happened probably i mean
probably it's probably happened at least
once because the president has that
power
the president could just say why is this
top secret i just tossed this folder you
know somebody write this down this one's
not top secret anymore that's
possibility the other possibility is
that stuff comes in
that looks like it's not top secret
but when the people in the oval office
look at it they're like oh
oh actually upon better thinking we
better not let anybody see this
and so they reach into a drawer and slap
a folder on it and then they do the
paperwork
but but i think you'd want to get the
folder onto it
right away
right
like i get that the paperwork has to be
done
but you're not going to leave it
unfolded
while you work through the paperwork
right you're going to reach into your
desk you can slap a folder on it you're
going to hand it to the secretary or
whoever and say you know do the
paperwork to make this top secret
so here's the question
is it normal
to have empty top secret folders
somewhere in the
in the working area of a president
my intuition tells me that that would be
common
but i don't know
it seems common
and so if somebody threw a bunch of
stuff in the box
what evidence we have that it was
anything but extra ones
so and then the other question is can't
we tell if something's missing at this
point
so at this point the gsa whoever has a
list of all the documents
now we also have a list of the documents
that have been recovered
can't they tell us which ones are top
secret and missing
because the ones that were top secret
they they must have been recorded as in
the president's
possession
so again there's like obvious questions
that are not being asked
apparently the president at his rally
had a speaker there who's been um
advocating for the release of some of
these january 6 defendants but one of
them is uh really a sketchy case
so one of them
one of the jailed still jailed
january 6 protester types
is
an
actual
hitler supporter
like an actual nazi
like actually has been photographed with
a little hitler mustache
talks about it openly
right so so there's at least one guy
that's being held in jail
because he's overtly
nazi sympathizer
now
so here's my point oh
you're ahead of me hold on you'll be
happy you'll be happy
i know where you're going on this but
hold on hold on
hold on
that isn't illegal
that isn't illegal
and do you know why the judge is holding
him he has not been accused of violence
he has not been accused of violence he
has not been accused of violence
he has not been accused of violence
here's why he's being held
the judge in the case said he should
held a waiting trial because he posed a
threat to the public
and that there was a potential for a
quote escalation of violence from his
alleged long-held neo-nazi beliefs
he is overtly
and publicly
and transparently being held in jail
for crimes that somebody suspects he
might
do not for crimes he did
not for crimes he did now the crime he
did gives them the cover for holding him
of course
the crime of trespassing i suppose
but
um
i don't care that he's a nazi
sympathizer i mean i care of course i
care that he's a nazi sympathizer but
it's not really relevant to this
question is it
not really relevant
this is very unacceptable
and the trouble is it's a trap you see
the trap
because you you know you can see that
trump walked into the trap the trap is
that as long as they keep at least one
person who is definitely a neo-nazi
they've got to keep at least one who's
definitely a neo-nazi
because then when trump releases let's
say all of them or pardons them
then trump released a neo-nazi
that's the game
there's no way that this isn't a
political
imprisonment
there's no way
and
you know all right i'm just going to say
this
this might be the last time you see me i
always say that but you know i never
know when it's going to be the last time
you ever see me
but one of the biggest issues is the the
concern a valid concern
that the public is getting whipped up
against the against judges against the
fbi
against the department of justice
and that the public might
become dangerous and we don't want a
world where the public is
threatening judges would you agree
you don't want a world where people are
threatening judges
do you
if your judge puts somebody in jail for
obviously just a political reason
you don't want that person to be
threatened to you
no
we don't want anybody to be threatened
with violence but boy if anybody ever
got close to the point where you would
change your mind
it would be somebody who put somebody in
jail just to you
just to you
that's why
and i'm not talking about the person
who's in jail
he's getting too
but you know i don't care that much
about a neo-nazi
frankly
frankly i don't care about him
personally
but in terms of the concept
freedom of speech equal justice and the
fact that this clearly seems to be a
trap that's been set for people like me
this is a trap
for me
right the moment i found out about this
story i said to myself a i can't resist
it
and b i'm going to be flying really
close to the sun here when i talk about
this because even what i've said so far
it's enough to be taken out of context
isn't it i've already said enough that i
could be
you know
rupaul edited into complete oblivion
but i had to say it
i had to say it
and that's the trap because you can't be
a good citizen and let this
go unmentioned
so here i have a choice of being a
patriot
like being a citizen being trying to be
useful
definitely at the risk of my entire
career
my entire career is risked just to say
something that is right and true
and good for the country
it's just amazing amazing times when
but
um
this is the sort of thing where uh
a trump presidency sort of
would clean some of the
cobwebs out of the system
and they're definitely some cobwebs
there
you know what i what i suspect was
trump's biggest mistake politically
i think it was during his
debate with hillary clinton
in which he said directly if he were
president she would be in jail
i believe that hillary was actually
worried about going to jail like actual
jail
i think she actually was worried about
that and i believe that the response
of the the democrats who who sort of did
things i wouldn't have expected to see
the the intelligence agencies the fbi et
cetera they they acted as though they
were protecting hillary and the only way
to do that is to take trump down
so i think that what you you and i are
watching
is hillary trying to stay out of jail
by putting trump in jail
and maybe not just hillary but people
associated with her
you know what i mean so to me this looks
like hillary and democrats trying to
stay on a jail
and the way they can do that is to take
down trump and all of his supporters and
it's working
it's working so far
if trump gets back in office
and he doesn't need to get reelected
because it's a second term
i've got a feeling some people might go
to jail
i don't know if the system can convict a
democrat frankly
you know a high-ranking democrat i don't
even know if this system could do it
the system is so corrupt at this point i
wouldn't even trust it to be able to put
somebody in jail no matter how good the
evidence is
but that's what i see i think it's just
hillary trying to stay out of jail and
everything else is about that
so the chief financial officer of bed
bath and beyond
jumped out of a hotel window
noah's in his high-rise apartment jumped
out of a high-rise apartment window to
his death
now he had been accused of pumping up
the stock and and selling his shares
before people knew that there was
problems there
so he was involved in a financial
scandal
but what caught my eye is that it was at
his apartment
where he has both a bed and a bathroom
and now he's he's gone to the grade
beyond
so
code reuse
question
did cnn always label its opinion opinion
did they
no it's not too soon
he was a crook
if he wasn't a crook it was too soon
but
allegedly he was a crook
so
um
i can't remember because i saw that they
did label dean obadiah's opinion now
dean obadiah is famous for having you
know the most anti-trump opinions
or among the most anti-trump
and
he's talking about how trump's remarks
are alarming
giving the
um
you know the the unprecedented spike of
threats against the fbi
now what do you think of that do you
think that trump is the cause
of the unprecedented threats against the
fbi is it trump's is he the one that
caused that
is it his rhetoric that's causing the
increase in threats against the fbi
or
or
i'm just going to put this out there as
an alternative
could it be the behavior of the fbi
could it be that the behavior of the fbi
itself
is bringing
problems to the fbi
to imagine that the problem with the fbi
is its critics
is a pretty up opinion
i'm pretty sure that you can't
you didn't create the situation by
criticizing them
my god
now
so the question is since this opinion is
in my opinion it's just ridiculous it's
a ridiculous opinion and i don't even
know if it's a real opinion it's the
kind you read you go does he even think
that
is that a real opinion um
but i wonder if the new head of cnn is
making the crazy opinion people at least
label it as opinion
i think maybe i used to say opinion but
i don't remember
all right um
here's another note
another indication of cnn is moving
toward the middle
so they had a story prominently on the
for on the front page of cnn
that an executive of black lives matter
global network foundation
is accused of siphoning off 10 million
dollars from donors
and the suit is against executive uh
chalamet bowers
the foundation itself um and her
consulting firm ebola
so
that's on cnn
i don't believe fox news covered it
at least i didn't see it on the front
page
so this is cnn
with there was no
there was nothing about this story that
softened it
this was just cnn saying boom black
lives matter executive big thief
you know it didn't throw in any blood it
saved the world you know the the larger
organization
is is good nothing like that just
straight news
top top person was a crook that's the
news do with it what you want
i like this
i'm liking this
every time cnn does something that
clearly is
unbiased i'm going to call it out
because i think they need a little bit
of encouragement
how many of you think that
the if we had the
if we had more explanations of why
people were going to epstein's island so
much
we'd know something useful
are you aware that many of the
visitors to epstein island were adult
women just famous
famous prominent adult women
if you knew that there were a lot of
famous prominent adult women
who presumably were not involved with
any weird sex stuff
right because they were older than 15 so
probably not
doesn't that tell you that whatever was
happening at epstein island was at least
sometimes innocent
am i wrong
the fact that a lot of the travelers
were prominent adult women who are not
accused of anything
and didn't say they saw anything
doesn't that tell you that some of those
trips i don't know what percentage
but some of those trips were completely
innocent
or at least for some of the people who
visited that doesn't mean the other
people on the plane didn't have fun i
don't know who knows
right now i'm not talking about glenn
but
i'm not sure we should make anything of
the fact that famous people went there
um i would think that his business model
was to get as many famous people
involved as he could
but it's not like he blackmailed all of
them
i think he just wanted as many famous
people
you know in his in his uh
field of influence as he could get
all right
so
it's a holiday
is anybody laboring
i know a lot of you are
stanley kubrick's death
he wasn't already
dead
um
going to work in an hour okay
you're at the office right now all right
you're working and watching that's what
i like it's a holiday so you should be
listening to me and working less
adult women don't engage
in kinky sex
well there's no allegations that epstein
was involved with anything with adult
women
all right
yeah
how many of you saw me watch my dog on
livestream
that that was the strangest content
because half of the people were like
yeah more of this
and half of the people were like uh we
don't want to walk so you watch a dog
oh well over on locals people liked it
all right good
well
if i wash her again
i'll uh i'll televise again
catering to adulthood
all right well are any of my opinions
actually leaks
that's a very insightful question
somebody asked if any of my opinions are
leaks
but i think you mean my predictions
don't you
that that would be the better question
are any of my predictions
fake because i already know what's going
to happen well i've told you that the
best predictions are the ones that are
already happening
but i usually stick to the ones where
like i could just tell it's already
happening i don't i don't need any
inside information
and the answer is yes i have done that
more than once
more than once i've made predictions
that were based on inside information
and you know what
they are no more or less accurate than
the ones that are not based on inside
information
let me tell you something about inside
information
it's not that accurate
it's not that accurate
i almost placed a very large bat
on some inside information
now the person who told it to me had a
good source
and it was solid it didn't turn out to
be true now nothing about the election
nothing about the kraken something
completely different and for a moment i
thought oh it was something you
could bet on
so the betting market had a specific
question on it i thought oh man
i'm gonna i'm gonna place a big bet
and then i thought to myself
i don't know there's something about
this doesn't feel right
and so i didn't
and it turned out to be wrong
now my understanding is that it was
right when i was told but that a
decision actually changed after the fact
so the point is that even insider
information is not reliable it really
isn't
you know it might be slightly better
than the public stuff but
it is also unreliable
like nvidia
uh
innocent people all knew they were
compromised just by being there yeah i
suppose
that's true
do adhd
all right
so
i uh
i saw an article that i tweeted jeff
pilkington uh spotted this
and there was next there was an expert
who was describing adhd
as not somebody who is easily distracted
rather it was a
future blindness
in other words it looks to everybody
even even the person with adhd it looks
to everybody who's observing
like they keep getting distracted with
what's in front of them and therefore
they're late
so they don't get places on time because
they're just
keeping it distracted that's what it
looks like to everybody
and the expert says total illusion it's
a total illusion
what it is is that the adhd people have
future blindness
meaning they can
they they care about what's happening
right now so that's why they're chasing
the shiniest object in their environment
because it's happening right now
and
once you
i don't know if this is true yet
so i'm going to present this as not
necessarily true
but as a filter or an alternate way of
understanding what you're seeing
and and here's what i liked about it if
you've known anybody who had this
behavior and i've i've known three
people
who consistently would be two hours late
for stuff do you know anybody like that
somebody who's consistently
two hours late
right
most people know at least one person
like that and do those people
exhibit any adhd
personality
um characteristics
probably
yeah i just blew your adhd mind didn't i
i'm blowing a lot of minds right now now
apparently this idea has been around a
little while but it's the first time i
heard it
and
and so i'm going to offer you this
experiment
i want you to experiment if you have
adhd
or you know somebody does and you can
talk to them experiment with this
blindness thing
and have them do this
the next time they're preparing to go
someplace that you know they're going to
be late to
just see if you can get them to do this
exercise
before they go to get ready
just spend some time visualizing the
entire path
from the moment you're getting ready
to you know putting on your clothes to
getting in the car to getting to the
place to you know what time it is and
sort of imagine it as a timeline and
it's all connected
so what you're trying to do is is
imagine
what you're doing now as on a timeline
bar
that is connected totally to the output
you know the end the end point and just
spend a little time
doing a picture in your head
picture it so it's like a little movie
in your head you're like okay now i'm
putting on my shirt getting on my
clothes i see them walking through the
door i see the other people gathering up
or getting in the car and just just talk
through it as visually as you can
and then just see
if connecting
connecting the output with the moment
see if you can keep that alive while
you're doing it as well
now what will probably happen is that
the moment you start getting busy with
what's in front of you
you will become
future blind
so there's a pretty high chance that you
can't even do this exercise
am i right
i think if a lot of you tried
you would end up saying oh i forgot to
do it or you'd have some excuse
but it just wouldn't happen
i think that's what would happen because
i think the blindness sets in and
there's nothing you can do about it
once you're blind you're blind
i mean you can't talk yourself out of
the blindness
you just can't see it so the question
would be whether if you practiced seeing
it before you get in the putting on your
makeup getting ready mode if any of that
can can cross over into the bubble
now my thinking is it might not work the
first time
it might not work the first time
you might have to try it a bunch of
times
and maybe try some variations that you
feel like would work for you
just see if you get lucky
and if any of you get lucky and it makes
a difference
let me know
because i do think that
well let me tell you something that
hypnotists believe
when hypnotists look at therapists let's
say the people who are trained to deal
with the problems i'm talking about adhd
being late so the people were experts on
that
the experts will tell you well it's
going to take lots of sessions and you
know we'll work on it over time but they
also get paid by the hour
so the people who get paid by the hour
will tell you it's going to take lots of
sessions
the hypnotist who might be you know
let's say volunteering to do it for free
will tell you it's either going to be
fast or it doesn't work
do you know why
well some hypnotists also charge by the
hour so those symptoms will tell you
well it's going to take many sessions
but let's say you've got somebody to do
it for free
the person who's going to do it for free
is not going to tell you that it takes
many sessions
because i don't think any hypnosis
believes that
the one who does it for free is going to
say one to three sessions
one to three
because that after the third one if it
doesn't work it's not going to work
it's just not going to work
but if you saw some progress in the
first three
you say oh let's let's keep pushing this
this might work for you not work for
everybody everybody's different but you
can find something that works for
everybody usually
so that that's my hypothesis and and the
hypnotist would say
that this type of problem is almost
instantly solvable
not for everybody
i have to throw in the not for everybody
anytime i'm talking about persuasion
you should hear that automatically not
for everybody
not all the time not quickly
right those those are the universals not
for everybody not all the time not
quickly
but this is one of those that it could
work for some people
quickly it could
there's some people who might be able to
do an exercise maybe not that exercise
but something in a similar vein
that would actually cure you instantly
that's that's a distinct possibility
within the hypnosis world view
so we'll see but it's something you
could test and i guarantee it won't hurt
you
right imagining imagining the path to
your destination is not going to hurt
you
there's no downside to this
it'll either work and then you'll tell
me about it and we'll solve the problems
for the world
or it won't
by the way i was adding up the number of
cures things i've
cured and
i'll tell you it's a really long list
of like medical problems i've cured in
people
and
some of it is because i reframed
something they stopped drinking they
lost weight
sometimes it's because i told somebody a
fix was available
so i just told them of a medical
solution that they didn't know about
and so then they got fixed but if you
count the number of people i've advised
correctly who got the right treatment
and they got fixed
it's it's hundreds
if not thousands
i mean i have no way to count it but
it's at least hundreds
of people i've
cured not me alone but i've put them on
the path to a cure
so when i when i tell you hey i think
maybe the collectively the you know i
call this the collaborative iq
so it's not my intelligence that's
driving this process
i'm i'm just sort of an organizer
but the intelligence is the collective
intelligence
right
and that's always true because if i got
outside of
what all of you thought was reasonable
you'd stop watching
so basically you constrain you constrain
me
and then i boost what you're thinking
and it's like this collaborative
intelligence so
could a collaborative intelligence that
does a b testing
cure adhd
for some people
some of the time
not necessarily correctly
all right we got a npc alert
and all capital letters from philip your
arrogance is strong today
let us analyze philip for what is wrong
with his personality
philip
you're very insecure
very
insecure here's the thing
are you
are you threatened by the fact that i've
cured people
and i can demonstrate it i mean all i'd
have to do is ask people here have i
cured you of any health problems and you
would see a stream of confirmation it'd
be easy and i've done it lots of times
and people write to me all the time so i
know it's true i don't know how many
that would be different
but
if if
if you think that telling you
that i can cure you of
sometimes incurable diseases if you
think that what you're seeing there is
my arrogance
you're kind of throwing out the baby
with the bathwater aren't you
you don't think you could handle a
little bit of my
the feeling that i'm being arrogant you
don't think that that would be sort of a
small
price to pay
for the fact that people are actually
solving lifetime problems health
problems
why would you want to discourage me from
doing that
philip
i i have a hypothesis that i learned
when i was developing dilbert in my
cubicle here's sort of a deep
psychological hypothesis for you
that men
unless you're truly a best friend or a
family member
they don't really like your success
man can you confirm this for me unless
you're truly a best friend
you don't really like other men's
success
you don't really like it
it's threatening we're just built that
way there's nothing you can do about it
right
now if it's a family member
like a true friend yes
in those cases you are genuinely happy
but if it's just somebody you heard
about
maybe you're not so happy right
here's how i discover this when i was
developing dilbert in my cubicle
i would often do a comic that i would
draw on my white board that was just
about the office and something that
happened
and people liked it they liked it enough
that they encouraged me to become a
professional
now what did
women do when they walked into my
cubicle
here's what women would do
sometimes they'd read the comic and they
would laugh or not laugh
right
do you know what men would do
here is what the three-quarters of all
the men would do
they would accidentally lean on the
board
and erase part of it with their back
a lot
a lot in other words they were
accidentally destroying the thing
that allowed me to show off
because women were walking into my
office and being oh you can do that you
can draw a comic oh that's cool you have
a skill
and men were making sure that that got
hidden or destroyed
who would be texting me at this time of
the day
all right
so have you ever noticed that
have you ever noticed that men will
accidentally
destroy something that allows you to
show off
right
now that's what that's a little bit what
you were seeing there
so there was somebody in the comments
who was listening to me literally curing
people of health
curing people of health problems
and he had a problem with it do you know
what his problem was
was it my arrogance
now i'm not i'm not saying i'm not
arrogant that's not even the question
so we're not doing yes no whether he's
accurate
i'm just saying what was his motivation
let's say he was accurate
even if he was accurate that i was
acting arrogant was that worth a comment
is that why you did it
now my world view is this
that men can't allow me to show a
quality that anybody would respect
that some men are really uncomfortable
with that and it usually has to do with
their own life
and they need to suppress other men in
every way that they can
so that they feel better about whatever
they're not getting done themselves
so that's what that's all i see
so here's here's another answer to the
question
scott how can you go into this sewer
of social media and watch
streams of insults about your character
your looks your intentions
everything
how can you do that and survive
and part of it is reframing
like just that when i see that comment
that doesn't look like it's about me
am i wrong
the person who called me arrogant in
this context specifically the context
of healing people from health problems
mostly just by telling them that there's
a solution that they can go get
right
i mean if you're gonna if you're gonna
 on that there's something going on
with you
right
so this is a good model
and by the way it's not like i invented
or anything a lot of smart people use
this model when somebody comes at you
like that in a personal way they're not
attacking the argument they're attacking
the person
they have a personal problem
that's just being expressed through
their bad attitude
and if you can learn to see them as
damaged
you don't see them as your critic
i see them as just damaged
they go oh
there's some debris laying by the road
i don't think the debris laying by the
road
is a threat to me
if i see roadkill
you know what i don't think
oh what's it think of me
no i i try not to hit it with my car i
try to avoid it
right so when i see comments like that
like oh you're arrogant oh you're so
arrogant
that doesn't feel personal
it feels like somebody's damaged
and they're acting out
so it makes a lot easier right
so that's why i don't have to go
after this is done
i will not have to go
cry myself to sleep
because somebody had a bad opinion of me
because i don't think that happened
i don't think there was any opinion of
me
i think there was somebody had a
personal problem
and then they acted out in public
and then i observed it
that's all i experienced
i didn't experience an insult
now
is my interpretation of it accurate
well some of you would say no he
actually insulted you scott
but i say if you can
reframe your experience in one that
doesn't hurt
go ahead and do it
so i just reframe my experience in a way
that doesn't bother me and so
it's legal it's available to me
so i just do it
and it works
that's a reframe exactly that is a
reframe
well i don't think i cured him of his
problem but
but but he might have some insight
is in the book yet uh
not exactly but i might revisit that
i'm still adding
or reframes
let me ask you this
is there a reframe
that i haven't already talked about
that i've ever mentioned that ever
helped you
now i know that alcohol is poisoned help
people
but are there other reframes
that you sort of picked up
just along the way and you say oh i'm
thinking about it that way from now on
anything that helped you
because those are the ones i want to
include in the book if there's one that
i didn't even think of as a reframe
but you took it that way
um
if you can't sleep oh if you can't sleep
you didn't put in enough work okay
oh hearing cha-ching for criticisms in
my writing that's a good one
um
do the alcohol one again it's just
alcohol is poison that's it that's the
whole thing
systems not habits yeah
the suicide refrain what was that
oh the suicide reframe was to curiosity
right
right
so let me say that again
if you have a really bad day where
you're in a bad mood
if you waste that you're don't waste
that
don't waste that i had a bad day the
other day so i had to fire somebody
so i just used it to fire somebody
[Laughter]
and then i felt i felt good
because it was something i needed to do
and it got off my list
so
if you're wasting a bad attitude
you're really missing out
because when i have a bad day
do you ever have a bad day when there's
nothing that could bother you it's so
bad
like you know nothing could bother me
today because i'm already in such a bad
mood it's not going to make any
difference at all
and then you can just do all those
things that would have bothered you
otherwise
yeah all those things
uh any manager can take criticism nobody
can take humiliation did i say that
sounds like something i might have said
oh saying it was your honor to take care
of your mother before she died even
though she was a crappy parent
that's one of my favorites
yeah
well my favorite for dealing with
tragedy which is usually the death of a
loved one
is that it's not a tragedy it's an honor
it's an honor
if you can be
one of the last ones in the room
that's an honor
and i certainly feel that way for my
animals
there's no way i wouldn't be in the room
for my cat's passing
that's an honor
a view on pardon dangling it's good
strategy
pardon dangling is good political
strategy people will vote on that basis
uh
that's why you tell your patients
families as a hospice nurse well good so
a hospice nurse is
confirming that reframe that's good to
hear
oh i'm sorry about your dog jack
oh yeah somebody likes my everyone is
addicted to something
i don't think i have that in the book
yet
oh remind me to put that in the book
yeah everyone's addicted to something
you just have to pick one an addiction
that's good for you you know exercise
that's a good addiction
and if you had if you had to pick a
mind-altering one
there are definitely some that are
better than others
now i don't recommend anybody you smoke
marijuana because i'm not a doctor and
it is a drug
legal or not it's a drug so i don't
recommend a drug to anybody
talk to your doctor
but
of all the drugs that i personally could
do given that i don't metabolize alcohol
very well etc
it's the best it's the best addiction
for me
now it has its downsides
as everything does
but of all the addictions i could choose
it's the best one
for me but yours would be different
uh your wife mindy is listening she says
hello and won't stop commenting during
the stream mindy
mindy
i think mindy uh
we have to give her the uh the listener
award
mindy you are listener of the week i'm
gonna give you an award for this
because you're the most engaged listener
that i've heard of all morning
so everybody give mindy
uh some respect
because mindy mindy's engaged
she's involved
a post-divorce
reframe um i offer you mine
you got married because you both wanted
to get married
and you probably got divorced because
you both wanted to get divorced that's
usually the way it works
so you got what you wanted twice
that's how it works
that's your best case scenario
things go wrong
all the time do you know what would be
far worse
not getting a divorce
it sounds like that would have been
worse
now i also like the uh
um and i'm in this situation right now
so this weekend i'll have basically
you know close to no human contact
for like three days
it's not exactly true but you know i
would say
23 out of 24 hours
i'll have no human contact for the
three three days
could you handle that
could you handle that little human
contact
for three days in a row
a lot of you say yes
yeah you prefer it you know i love i
love my privacy when i don't have to
have it
i like privacy
uh if it's optional i don't like it if
it's forced on me
yeah so so i'm in a situation now where
i have to rebuild who i am
right after my first divorce and after
the first you know there's a
relationship before that each time i had
to start from scratch and just figure
out who i am
there's a uh
imagine dragon song
that got me through my first divorce
and it was um
you'll probably help me you'll have to
help me with the title of it it's about
starting from the bottom and
building building back
what's the name of it
it's imagine dragons
and you're starting at the bottom and
you're working yourself back it was sort
of an inspirational
story what's the title of it
anyway
but the uh the essence of it was there
was somebody who
if i understood the lyrics right it was
somebody who was dropping out of music
some kind of performing arts school i
assume this is the actual biographical
story of the singer
and
he dropped out with not knowing what was
next
and he he called us starting from the
bottom and building back up is it
radioactive
or is it called start over
i don't know whichever ones
um
no it's not called start over is it
that's the actual name of the song
i don't think so
but
the point is this
this is very much the
freedoms just another word for nothing
left to lose
so if you're focused on the stuff you
lost you're going to miss the fact that
you just opened up all of your options
and you finally are experiencing freedom
and it's really scary
so last night
at i don't know eight o'clock or so
um it was still really hot
and i decided to go swimming
and just use my hot tub
and
i was all alone
except for the dog
and as much as i love
swimming at night
by myself normally a terrific thing the
fact that i didn't have the option
like i just didn't have anybody to be
with at that time
that
it was really disturbing
it was disturbing
and i i tried to see if i could reframe
it as a plus
to just enjoy see if i could enjoy the
quiet
so i put my phone aside
and just tried to look at the sky
and tried to remember what it ever felt
like before i had a phone
and
i have some good advice on youtube to
get a gay house boy
thank you
now i had not considered that option but
i'll put that on the list okay
um
and it worked and it worked i would say
that i did manage
to
calm my restless
social media driven mind
and i could simply enjoy being alone
just for what it was
it wasn't easy it wasn't easy at all
but it but it worked
all right
um
