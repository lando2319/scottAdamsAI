it is
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
which uh looks a little bit less lighted
than the usual but I think I could deal
with that today
if you would like your day to be the
most amazing amazing day in all the
history of days all you need this day is
a copper mugger a glass of tanker
Charles sustain a canteen Joe The flaska
Vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the end of the day the thing makes
everything better you could probably
feel your oxytocin starting to come
online can't you can't you yeah this is
called the simultaneous sip happens now
and it's the best thing that's ever
happened go
ah
and may I say happy 65th birthday to
to I didn't catch the name but what if
he was having a 65th birthday today
so happy birthday
senior citizen
welcome to the club
well we got news all over the place Dave
Chappelle made a surprise stand-up visit
in San Francisco and uh he was a little
distressed to find out why it happened
to his what he calls his second Home San
Francisco
apparently he was going into a
restaurant and as he was walking into
the restaurant there was a
one of the freedom crappers was
defecating in front of the restaurant
now I don't know about you but
that does not uh that does not help my
dining experience
I'll tell let me tell you something I
learned owning a couple of restaurants
the restaurant business
is very let's say different from what
you imagined it would be
in terms of how people conceive it as
customers
people don't really go to a restaurant
for just the food obviously they could
buy food somewhere else it's an
experience
and so one of the things that you find
is that one of the most important
criteria
for whether someone likes a restaurant
is the lighting I've told you that
before very it's very non-obvious if you
get the lighting right
people will like being in your
restaurant if you get it wrong it makes
everybody look ugly so your date will
look a little less attractive you'll
look a little less attractive you know
if you have down light that makes
everybody look less good but if you have
nice accent lights and you know orangey
lights and stuff everybody looks good
so I can't imagine what it does to your
excuse me dining experience
to walk past a freedom Grabber now if
you don't know the
um in the old days
they used to call people the homeless
now they used to the old old days
the people who did not live indoors were
called hobos
or bums
and that was pretty bad right hobos and
bums very degrading
so
the left wanted to turn that into
homeless
because homeless is more of an objective
statement it's not an insult
they just don't have a home but then it
turned into it wasn't so much the people
who didn't have a home
because most of them had options
but rather they chose to be outside they
chose the freedom
of the streets and so
we've evolved from bums and hobos
to the homeless
then I think there was the unhoused
right they weren't homeless because they
didn't want homes they were just
unhoused
but I think we could do a little bit
better than that I think as one of the
locals folks have suggested that they
should be called the freedom grappers
because they can
crap anywhere sort of the ultimate
freedom
so I say uh don't judge it until you try
it but Dave Dave Chappelle seems to be a
little unhappy about what happened he
thinks the whole place turned into uh
into the tenderloin which doesn't mean
anything to you unless you know San
Francisco
to say that the whole city turned into
the tenderloin it was a really bad
insult to the city
but Dave Chappelle at least has a
suggestion you know
a lot of people complain about things
but rarely does anybody have a
productive suggestion and finally Dave
Chappelle has a good suggestion for
fixing San Francisco he says uh
uh what you need is uh Batman
okay well that's maybe less practical
than I was hoping but he does have us at
least a suggestion all right at least
it's a suggestion
all right uh
um I asked to Bard the AI a little bit
more about me to see uh
um if I thought I was a good person or a
bad person and it said a few things
about me let's see
um Adams has been criticized for his
views on race and ethnicity
wow
that's what Bard AI thinks something
I've been criticized about my views on
race and ethnicity my God what is it
that I've said well let's read on in
2020 he said on Twitter that the Dilbert
TV show was canceled because he was
white and UPN had decided to focus on
African-American audience
on Monday night not every night
but on the night that my show was on
they decided to an all-black comedy
black comedy block a black block
um which is a perfectly good business
idea in terms of business
you know you like people to tune in and
then stay stay where they tuned in that
was the old business model anyway so it
made sense to have an African-American
comedy night unfortunately that was my
night
when my show is on so I got moved and
when you move a show end of its time
slot
there's a long history where that pretty
much kills the show that's so well
understood phenomenon
so somehow that is the example given of
why I was criticized for my views on
race
what was my view
was there any opinion in that
that was just a statement of fact which
nobody disagrees with
nobody disagrees that UPN started a
black comedy block on Monday night where
my show was running
that's not there's no controversy to
that
is there and I did I say that there was
anything
illegal or wrong or immoral or unethical
about UPN wanting an all-black comedy
night I don't have any problem with that
at all
it was actually seemed like a good
business idea it just wasn't good for me
so that's so that's but then it goes
more goes on
says he meeting me has also been
criticized for his support of Donald
Trump
wait a minute is that something about
being criticized for views on race and
ethnicity
somehow that got lumped in there
and his views on white nationalism
wait
what
what my views on white nationalism
have I ever expressed a positive view
about white nationalism
ever even once
am I the guy who has ever said that
America is better with just white people
in it or stop any additional non-white
never
I'm the most annoyingly pro-immigration
person you know
[Laughter]
at least you know who has an audience
that's right leaning there's nobody with
the right leading audience who's more
pro-immigration than I am that's just a
fact
right name anybody
name anybody in fact I'm probably as
pro-immigration as the left it's just I
think you have to do some smart stuff
too you can't just never do smart stuff
you have to do some smart stuff
you know at the same time but
do you see the problem with Bard and AI
this is clearly just picking up a
leftist
biased bigoted View
Bart is just a racist
could you could you conclude from this
answer that Bard is a racist what do you
think I would say yes to me this looks
clearly racist
the very anti-white basically
yeah now I don't think it's the end of
the world we'll probably
you know clean it up and maybe it'll get
better but oh my God the fact that we
built an advanced intelligence and then
we ruined it by making it like people
we ruined it by making it like people
it'll never be smart
we'll never let it be smart
so
well keep an eye on that
um
here's some CNN biased news I was re I I
forget who wrote it some opinion piece I
think and it it's talking about uh
whether the Biden family the so-called
Biden crime family has committed any
actual crimes
and you may have missed this
um because it was a surprise to me but
the article said that even the
Republicans even the Republicans have
not accused Joe Biden of a crime
is that true
it might that I think it is true right
there's no actual specific crime no Joe
Biden Joe Biden I'm not talking about
Hunter
100 Biden has specific crimes but Joe
Biden is not not accused of a specific
crime is he
and then I thought I'm not aware of one
because
well bribery is a suspicion
right bribery is a suspicion that but is
short of an accusation because there's
not a there's not a direct
you know is that in context I'll give
you I'll give you that the I'll give you
that the evidence strongly suggests
strongly suggests
something unethical going on but if you
can't tie that unethical Behavior to
let's say a policy change
and prove it
it's got a short of a crime isn't it
it's just something you wish would not
be happening which is different
so that was interesting but uh and maybe
that's good for us if it if it helps
your bias and all
but here's something it said that if
this is just such a head shaker
um
CNN in this least opinion piece wanted
to make a comparison to
the Biden family having lots of shell
companies whose businesses are unclear
and the accusation is that these all
these companies are set up just to make
it harder to see that money is Flowing
from foreign entities to the Biden
family pockets
now that is being compared to
Trump also having lots of uh what they
say opaque business deals invite
suspicion so that's they're they're
admitting that the opacity or the fact
that you can't see what's going on in
the Biden family businesses
always makes people suspicious hey we
can't tell what's going on in there but
they compared that but they said but
it's a little strange to see Republicans
who defend Trump's business which is
divided into scores of companies now
attack the bidens
um
did have I ever mentioned that argument
by analogy
is not persuasive
now correct me if I'm wrong let me do a
little fact check on this
is it not the case that the Biden
companies the number of companies
they've created have no known business
and that's the whole point that there's
no known legitimate business there might
be but it's not it's not a you know
we're not aware of it
uh whereas the Trump businesses and
there were hundreds of them every single
one of them has a specific line of
business and a revenue and a cost
structure
every one of them
that's completely different
that's closer to the opposite right one
is an example of setting up businesses
to do business
perfectly acceptable no matter how many
you do
in fact that's the smart way to do it
because you know I would know why any
one of those businesses to be a problem
and crash the other business
whereas bidens don't have any any actual
business purpose to their businesses
that we know of could be just we don't
know of them
but so if you're if you're let's say a
casual reader
of CNN
wouldn't you read this As Trump is just
as sketchy as the Biden family
that doesn't that read that way to you
oh they both have these
these a whole bunch of companies oh oh
they both have a whole bunch of
companies don't they well I guess that's
just something rich people do they just
all have a bunch of companies no they
don't all have a bunch of companies that
aren't doing any business
that's not the same
all right
uh Rasmussen poll on Trump
and his legal problems
so 58 of likely yes U.S voters
um
would believe that Trump will get
criminal charges so 58 percent
of Voters think he will be charged
criminally while he's at the at the
moment leading in the polls
so according to I think it's Washington
Post ABC poll Trump is seven points out
of Biden in the general election
seven points is quite a bit isn't it
yeah now obviously that always tightens
up toward election day
but
it feels like a pretty healthy lead if
that's a valid poll
all right uh back to Rasmussen though
um
44 of likely voters think Trump is being
investigated because of actual crimes
that he has committed well fifty percent
believe the government is just trying to
stop Trump from running for president
now
we often look for signals that the
country is in trouble because that's
sort of
how Americans act oh no we're all
falling apart the Republicans falling
apart this or that signal or telling us
everything's falling apart
but here's a pretty strong flashing
signal that 50 percent of the voters the
likely voters think the government is
trying to stop a legitimate candidate
for president with a bogus
um bogus Department of Justice action
50 percent half of the country
thinks the country is
corrupt
in in a really fundamental way because
that would be as corrupt as you could
get that'd be that'd be like the peak of
corruptness
peak of corruption let's say
to actually stop uh you know a legal
candidate for running for president you
can't get much
more corrupt than that that's sort of
that's sort of the Pinnacle
uh but that's where we are
how many voters do you think believe
Trump will actually be sentenced to
prison
how many think you will be sent oh good
guess you're very close 28 percent
yeah your guesses were very close very
smart yeah 28 think you'll be sentenced
to prison
so
that means that 28 of the people are
either wishful thinking might be wishful
thinking
or they believe that when he talked to
the Georgia
uh what was the phone call in Georgia
where he said you only need to find so
many votes
28 think that you could go to jail for
using the word find
if someone else
determines that the word find means make
up
that that would be the case
you'd have to convince a jury
that when somebody said find in the
context of believing that the election
had not been properly counted that what
he really secretly meant and everybody
knew it was just makeups of votes and
that'll be fine
like that's going to work like do you
think that that Trump believed that
Georgia could just make up some votes
and that that would fly
and then you just go into office and
nobody'd be have a problem with that oh
no yeah we just changed the vote by
adding a bunch of votes for Trump and
now he really won
there's nothing to see here do you
really think that that Trump
was so dumb
that he thought he could ask them in a
phone call where people are listening
and so it's basically public or will be
soon
that he could just tell him to find some
you know make up some votes and that he
could get into office and he would stay
there
and that would all be good
there's literally nobody that dumb
to imagine that that Trump is the only
one in the in the world who would be
dumb enough to think
that he could say in front of witnesses
just pretend the election didn't matter
and make me up some votes and that would
just fly through and that he like a real
living a living human being with
experience in the world
would believe that that would work
it's ridiculous
of course he didn't think that now I'm
not a mind reader
but but it would be true that literally
no one would say that
no one not Trump not anybody there's no
one who would say that in front of
witnesses go go get me for some fake
votes
especially with this much scrutiny the
entire world was looking in Georgia
everybody was looking at it and they
already had a result
do you think nobody would notice if they
changed the result to the opposite of
the result nobody's going to look into
that a little bit how in the world would
Trump imagine that that could have
worked
all right in in your criminal Suspicious
Mind how do you imagine that he thought
that plan was going to work of course
that wasn't his plan do you know what
you do do you know what kind of plan it
would work really well
here's a plan that would work really
well
make sure you've counted all the votes
there's a plan people would believe
yeah we we looked and we found some
votes and we it's transparent we can
show you here are these bags we didn't
count these now we're going to count
them
the only way that the only way
that Trump's phone call could have
produced anything for Trump
is if they had gone through a legal
process and everybody knew it everybody
knew the one and only path was if it was
totally legal
and to imagine the 28 of our citizens
have been persuaded that that was an
actual criminal plan
they couldn't have worked it's like it's
like the Insurrection on January 6. were
they going to conquer the country by
taking over some real estate
one building
who thought that was going to work well
with the Joint Chiefs of the staff going
to just hand over the control oh they
got our buildings
there's a bunch of unarmed people
standing in a building I guess we better
give them the keys to the nukes
literally no one thought that was an
Insurrection who was actually there
yeah so but once again this one quarter
of the country or this 28 percent
will actually believe anything
25 percent of the country will believe
anything just anything
all right um
so there's some dispute about Tucker is
being removed from his show on Fox not
technically fired
but apparently Carlson is being reported
told a member of the networks
was told so this is from Tucker Carlson
apparently he's reporting that a member
of the Network's board of directors Fox
News board of directors told them that
he was taken off the air as part of Fox
News settlement with Dominion
do you believe that
do you believe that Tucker was taken off
the air as part of the settlement with
Dominion
now Dominion says they never asked for
that
and Fox News has officially said
absolutely not that was not part of the
negotiations
now I believe it was not part of any
written negotiations
because I don't think they would give a
a blanket
no
if it was discoverable you know I'm sure
it's all
non-disclosure situation but that stuff
always comes out so I would guess that
that's true
that is not written down
but does that mean it wasn't part of it
I would say it wasn't
I'm leaning toward it wasn't
and the reason is
um
yeah I don't think it was
because you would have to write that
down
so that's the sort of thing that nobody
would take on a handshake
because you wouldn't want to agree let's
say you're Dominion you wouldn't want to
say all right I'll cut my what I'm
asking in half or whatever the
settlement was
in Return part of what you're going to
do is get rid of Tucker Carlson but then
not ask them to write that down
because you can settle the thing and
then Fox News could say I changed your
mind we're going to keep them and then
with the settlement would be done
there's no lawyer that would let you not
write that down
right nobody's going to make a deal of
that size with a with a component that's
a handshake it's just all going to be
written down or it doesn't count so
I think that uh Fox News would not give
an outright denial
if in fact it would ever be discoverable
in anybody's paperwork that it was it
was false so
but that does open up the possibility
that it was part of let's say a
suggested
outcome
like maybe if I told you that there's no
chance that Tucker will be on the air
again
maybe if I told you that you'd be a
little more likely to you know negotiate
a settlement
can't guarantee it yeah we can't put it
in writing but uh between us yeah this
is going to happen maybe yeah so and you
have to weigh that against the fact that
Tucker is not a liar there's no history
of Tucker being a liar that I've ever
heard you know people argue that he's
wrong
but I've never heard anybody say you
lied have you I've never even heard it
I've never even heard of that accusation
so I think I would rule that out so I
think that it's possible both of them
are telling the truth
meaning that it's it's not part of the
deal in terms of being written down
but it might have been discussed
it might have been discussed and there
might it might have been discussed
enough that bull sides knew what was
going to happen
but they didn't have to write it down
Maybe
so I feel like maybe the stories are not
incompatible
it might be just a difference of what's
written and what's not written
anyway I'm speaking of lawsuits
do you remember when there was a bite
administration had the ministry of Truth
do you remember the brief Ministry of
truth that's what the the critics called
it
uh what it was supposed to be
is a disinformation organization that
would help get rid of foreign
disinformation
but quickly you know the Fox News
opinion people turned it into the office
of disinformation or something
but now the woman who was in that job
and quit because of all the pressure
is suing
so apparently she was mentioned by name
300 times by Fox News
and she says she was mischaracterized
that her job was not to stop you know
Free Speech but rather to stop
disinformation from foreign sources and
stuff
now I don't know if there's a difference
in
in opinion there because I feel like the
opinion people were saying
yeah that's what you say your job is
but we know it's gonna it's gonna drift
into this other domain of just censoring
Americans so I don't know if there's
really a difference in fact
but there might be a difference in at
least how she was portrayed
so she's suing
so it turns out that the only thing that
matters
is lawfare
like we are so far
from a world where citizens you know
become informed and vote and that's how
we do government there's nothing like
that happening it's basically it's a
legal battle you know of who can change
the voting laws and you know what kind
of ballots you can use and then stuff
like this you know it if Fox News gets
sued out of business
which looks like it might be the plan
but the plan might be to just sue them
out of business if you get enough of
these
um then the this gigantic voice
for you know half of the country or so
40 of the country would be removed
and that would change the election it
will come if Fox News stopped operating
tomorrow
don't you think that would change
election outcomes
I do
I think it would change them a lot so we
don't really have a government that's
run by anything like voting or informed
citizenry or Republic
none of that it's basically just lawyers
fighting and then that we find out how
they did oh well yay our lawyers beat
their lawyers this year
well let's let's play again in four
years all right lawyers get going
yeah it's just a legal contest and the
Voting is just ridiculous at this point
although I still recommend it
all right
um Vivek ramaswamy making some news on a
few uh policy things
now this one is interesting
he wants to consider raising the voting
age to 25. but make exceptions for young
adults who are fulfill some kind of a
service requirement
so that could include six months in the
military or a first responder role or or
the third one is pass a Civics test
administered to naturalized immigrants
which is really clever
you have to be at least as smart as
foreigners to vote in America
well actually they would not be
foreigners because they would be
naturalized at the point of taking the
test so there would be our beloved
residents so if you did not if you
couldn't pass the
the test to become a resident and you're
under 25 you can't vote
now
I have two feelings about this plan
number one is brilliant would you agree
it would absolutely make the country a
better run
place it would make our votes more
rational right so as an idea it's solid
which uh Vivek ramaswami is he has now
created a body of work
where you can see that every time he
enters a topic
he comes with some good ideas
however
I feel like this one doesn't have a
chance
because if you have fewer young voters
you have fewer Democratic voters and
that's the end of the conversation
am I am I wrong
there's no way you could put there's no
way you're going to get away with
putting on restrictions
restrictions on uh mostly Democrats
that's not could happen now it would
never pass any kind of
uh you know if it got to the Supreme
Court I can't imagine it working
can you
I don't even know if it's legal I don't
even know if you could make such a rule
seems to me you either Can Vote or you
can't vote
yeah there's an argument to be made that
either make everybody make everybody
pass that test which is not a terrible
idea
I've often said you should have an IQ
sort of a general IQ test that's just
about politics you know not about math
or whatever just politics and then find
out who the people who can pass the test
favor
wouldn't you like to know who the smart
people want as the leaders
the smart people would be the ones who
can pass the test and they know enough
about politics that you know their
opinion has some some weight
some weight that's deserved
yeah so I don't think this plan has a
chance but I'm going to evaluate them
him the way I would evaluate uh Trump
I'm going to evaluate as a political
strategy so as a law no chance
whatsoever as a political strategy
I don't know popular for the base
I liked it you probably liked it
it just doesn't have a chance but I
don't mind that he brought it up the
fact that he brought it up is both uh
reasonable
and it shows his thinking
and his thinking was solid it's just not
politically doesn't have much chance but
in terms of positioning who he is
and and for us to understand the let's
say the the boldness of his ideas and
that they're all based on science and
data it does a good job of that
it does a good job of showing that he's
data driven
it's just that it's too political
there's no chance
all right
also making news against uh once again
talking about using the military to take
on the cartels
everybody knows that would not be a
complete solution to Fentanyl
maybe not any solution at all but you
still have to do it
now anybody who says biscott that will
not change the number of people who die
of fentanyl whatsoever I say
so
so
if somebody murders you you don't say
well they only murdered one person
if you put this person in jail you know
they want their whole life and only
murdered one person
if you put them in jail is that really
going to stop any murders
because really they murdered one person
their whole life it was a special case
it's not going to happen again
so why put him in jail
right it's not going to stop any future
murders
that's how I think of the cartels
I don't care how many future fentanyl uh
overdoses it it changes maybe none
but they all need to be killed
because that's just the way it has to be
I'm not even going to give you an
argument
if you're if you're in the business of
killing my people you're gonna
die
I don't care what the law is I don't
care what the precedent is I don't care
what the ramifications are I don't care
if it helps the process or not if you're
killing my people
you're gonna die
and if it takes Rama Swami to do it I'm
all in
um Vivek is also the only one who's
saying I haven't I don't know if I've
ever heard a presidential candidate say
this maybe you can do a fact check
or maybe it happened in the 60s or
something but when was the last time a
candidate said he wanted to get rid of
affirmative action
has that ever been a thing
and by the way just to be clear
historically I have favored affirmative
action
because I think we needed some kind of a
you know big big hammer
to get things a little closer to even
but at the moment I think it's
counterproductive
if I were a black college graduate and I
was looking for a job I would not want
anybody to think I didn't get there on
Merit
I would want everybody to think college
so uh maybe yeah Larry Elder I don't
know if you wanted to get rid of it or
he was just against it there's a slight
difference there
um
but I do appreciate Vivek being in the
conversation on that
yeah I think we're at the point where
affirmative action at the moment hurts
more than it helps
but I do think there was a long period
where it probably helped more than her
even though it hurts a number of people
all right um
RFK Jr on nuclear energy I still I
haven't seen his most updated opinion
but I'm hearing from good sources that
he's still uh anti-nuclear energy but I
don't I don't want to characterize his
opinion too much
because I'm a little uh
I'm a little uh let's say under informed
but
this is his biggest problem I think
would you agree
RFK Jr's biggest problem is nuclear
because I don't think he can win enough
votes on the right to win in a general
election unless he's pro-nuclear energy
and I don't know if he can win on the
left if he's pro-nuclear energy
but I do think that he's persuasive
enough
that he could he could change the left
to have a more let's say a better risk
reward opinion of nuclear
and so what the world needs
is a public debate or conversation
between RFK Jr because I respect that
he's a good communicator I'd like to see
a really well-informed good communicator
who is PR whose anti-nuclear energy or
at least I don't know if anti is the
right word so again I don't want to
characterize his opinion but it's not
it's not a super pro nuclear energy
um I think he needs to have a public
conversation with Michael schellenberger
don't you
just think how much that would help the
country
because because here's here's what those
two people have in common
as far as you know
they don't lie to you
they don't lie to you
and they know what they're talking about
at a deeper level than people generally
know anything
right now they're not none of them are
scientists
but I think they're both close enough to
what the argument is that they can
represent them
so I don't think there's anything that
the United States needs more
than a public conversation between
Michael schellenberger and RFK Jr on the
topic of nuclear energy
wouldn't you agree
it's like it's it's a screaming need
because if it turns out the RFK Junior
has some good points that I'm not aware
of
I want to hear them
he might have a good point you know I'm
actually I have enough respect for his
intellectual capacity and his honesty
that if he had a different opinion than
I do I would first assume that he was
well informed
second I would be I would assume he's
trying to figure out what's good for the
country you know he's not trying to make
a buck somehow and I would listen to it
and if he had a good argument maybe he
could persuade me but he has he has The
credibility at least going into it but
Sheldon Burger has that too
shellenberger has a long history of
being credible and not being a partisan
so those are the two you want to hear
talk
I hope that happens
all right um
what else is going on
two uh two black guys are getting in
trouble in the news for not being
anti-white enough
so I'm wondering if this is going to be
a thing now so two prominent black
leaders and I'll tell you the details
are both in trouble today
from critics for not being anti-white
that's like a real thing
so the first one is in Virginia
so Martin Brown who's taking you over
the Dei
Department I guess and instead of
chasing Equity he wants to go for a
merit inequality
and he's a a black man
and he's getting lots of pushback
because he wants Merit instead of your
race
to determine your outcomes
and he's getting pushback
so this is one of those Doug young can
the new Governor's Place to take out Dei
so we'll see we'll see how that goes so
the only thing the even the NAACP is uh
calling on Mr Brown to resign
because he wants Merit over
uh
over these other things
all right also
mayor Adams Eric Adams no relationship
to me that I know of
um was at some law school I guess
graduation commencement address and a
number of these students turned their
backs on him and here's their complaint
the on the issue of Daniel Penny the
Marine who's White
who controlled the
black mentally Disturbed guy on the
subway
and the black guy died later we don't
know exactly the details of what made
him die but Eric Adams
because he's a legitimate leader like an
actual leader not just a pretend one
said you should wait to see the details
before you make up your mind
basically he supported innocent until
proven guilty
and a bunch of lawyers turned their back
on him just just hold that in your mind
he supported innocent until proven
guilty
and lawyers
lawyers turned their back on
for supporting innocent until proven
guilty
every one of the people who turned their
back on him they should have their
degrees just yanked away
not really but yeah I feel like that's a
real bad look for the law school
I forget what law school it is but if
you're producing lawyers who don't agree
with the concept of innocent until
proven guilty as long as it's a white
person who's involved
I'm sorry you're not going to be my
lawyer that's for sure
so but maybe this is the thing maybe
that maybe there are black leaders who
have decided not to be anti-white and
maybe you'll see more of it
because you know both of them still have
their jobs so they they haven't been run
out of town for not being anti-white
enough they're just getting criticism so
maybe it's safe
so again big props to uh
mayor Adams now I don't agree with him
on everything he does of course but
that's true of all politicians but good
work on this yeah sticking to the the
Constitution
so there's a big controversy whether
Trump can win over Suburban women
that's his big problem especially
because he's he's a grabbing
insulter of women
and
to me this is like a fascinating
question
because on one hand
it's hard to change a whole demographic
group that's against you to be for you
if anybody could do it
it would be Trump
I don't think you will do it
but he might be the only one who could
and and I was trying to think is there
any way he could pull that off he's
always going to have abortion working
against him
but he's taken that clever view that
it's not his opinion of abortion that
matters he wants the individuals to work
it out at the state level
that's a pretty strong constitutional
argument it just it doesn't persuasive
though I mean it's rational it's just
not persuasive
so it might it might decrease a little
bit the hatred that people have over
that issue but it's not going to help
them that much
so is there anything he could do
what could Trump do
that would win him Suburban women
they do like safety but it hasn't made a
difference yet right we haven't seen
that shift yet and you think you would
have seen it because certainly the news
is doing a good job of telling you that
everything is dangerous
I mean everybody knows that crime is up
everybody knows that the you know the
freedom grappers or numbers are growing
so
crime doesn't seem to be able to get it
done what about Fentanyl
what about fentanyl
now he has he said you know he'd be
willing to use the military on Mexico as
well
but do you think Suburban women care
about that or even think that would make
a difference
probably not I don't think Suburban
women are big on using the military to
take out anybody are they
do Suburban women usually vote for war
probably not
probably not
so what is it what is it that Suburban
women need and want
that theoretically Trump can offer them
that would make a difference
wine
free wine
kids
Yeah the more protecting kids
but that hasn't made a difference yet
education yes but it hasn't made a
difference yet
so I don't here's what I think I think
that women can't get past the
oh this is going to sound really sexist
but I think but I think this would apply
to men as well
so I think this will be less sexist than
it sounds because it would apply to men
as well just in in their own different
way
I believe that people support candidates
if they're not super political people
which is different
they support candidates like accessories
to their fashion
that's what I think in other words
you know when a woman and keep in mind
I'm going to say that this is true of
men as well right man puts on his you
know expensive watch and puts on some
cologne too so we're all we're all uh
using our accessories
to Market ourselves
I believe that a Suburban woman cannot
say she's a trump supporter because it's
a bad accessory
the same reason Suburban women don't
drive beat up pickup trucks
even if it's very functional it's just
not the right accessory now I think that
would be true of men as well you know
men men don't want to be associated with
Marianne Williams right Mariana Williams
it doesn't feel like very manly to say
you support Mariana Williams makes you
feel a little
a little uh
unsubstantial or something
so I don't think that people choose
their candidates entirely on policy
except for say the 20 of the country
that's trying to pay attention to that
stuff the 80 percent are going along
they're just going along and they want
to make sure that they've got the
accessory that everybody else is wearing
so looking at their feet and they're
saying can I wear UGGs
can I wear UGGs and they look at their
friends they go okay no Uggs
Uggs around
right so I think that Trump has that
problem
that if you're a Suburban woman he's not
the accessory that you can associate
yourself with
but if you're a uh a Suburban man it
doesn't feel the same does it I I
wouldn't feel I would not feel less of a
man or anything else for a sporting
Trump I would just feel people hating me
but but as a man
as a man having people hate me is just
sort of like routine
I'm just so used to it it just doesn't
mean that much to me
but if you're a woman could you support
somebody that would make your friends
possibly hate you
it's a little different I there probably
is I don't know this might be just
purely sexist so you can call me on it
if it is but I don't believe men give a
 as much as women do about what
other people think of them
is that is that generalization does that
hold
would you give me that generalization or
is that just sexist
at least I'm aware of it if it's sexist
at least I'm aware of it now I think
that generation I think that
generalization holds the men are a
little bit much more feu this is my
opinion I'll wear this hat if I feel
like it and women have to get along
you know better more combative generally
right so a man will take a contrarian
view because it's competitive
it's like the competitive kind of
attracts us to it a little bit oh you
hate this well then I'm twice as likely
to wear it
do you really really hate it then I'm
three times more likely to wear it
whereas women I think
are more likely to find a solution that
doesn't get anybody killed
and that is go long you know stick with
stick with the majority
so how could Trump change his change his
uh brand
to make him accessible to women so that
they're not embarrassed to say they like
somebody who's strong on crime
what could do that
well
well
trans now the trans issue won't get
anybody any votes
for or against it's too small
data man fix the economy
well but let me ask you what what is it
that women need the most
to be happy let's say moms
dick
no the wrong it's possible that dick is
the correct answer
but let's keep it in the political terms
I don't think Trump can get to all of
them
um
you save safety but I don't think safety
is working
right if safety were the button wouldn't
it already be activated
I feel like he needs to be not the
grabber
I think he needs to be more James Bond
and less
creepy creepy guy
if if he could change his reputation
to be Sean Connery
wibbled would like him no matter how
much he likes slapping them
because apparently Sean Connery was
famous for saying do a fact check on me
this is true right Sean Connery famously
said
that sometimes you have to slap a woman
is that true
you really said that right yeah and
and do you think Suburban women were
still attracted to Sean Connery I mean
maybe not at the moment but in his prime
I'm pretty sure they were
because somehow it fit with his Vibe it
is there any way
that Trump could change his Battleship
into more James Bond
so that even women would say all right
well he can grab me I mean Sean Connery
can grab me by the burnt
now
I don't know I'm just I'm just kind of
noodling through it I don't have a good
idea here
before cancer culture that was his
reputation I think you're right yeah
before cancel culture Trump was just a
Playboy right and people said oh Rich
Playboy that's okay
that was Trump's point that they led him
yeah
uh you'd have to lose weight
you think if Trump lost weight he would
be more popular with uh women
what if he shaved his head
what if he shaved his head and lost
weight
[Laughter]
all right it's never going to happen
yeah that's never gonna happen
all right
uh how do you stereotype women these
days I don't know if that was a question
or criticism
muscles well I I think he may have aged
down of the uh the Playboy mode
an apology you think if Trump apologized
that would help him with women
would it
now because he'd have to apologize for
something he said didn't happen
so I don't see that working now apology
seems like the wrong direction
all right well I still think there's
something that women want
that he could provide but he hasn't come
up with it yet I don't know what it is
it could be Fentanyl
I I don't think there are any mothers of
teens who are not panicked about
Fentanyl
so it could be sensible
that yeah he could say something along
the lines of you can hate me but I'm
trying to save your children
oh that would work
that would kind of work wouldn't it
so so the one thing that would take
women off of their
um let's say
their accessory thinking that I can't be
associated with Trump is if Trump was
unambiguously the one who could protect
their children
if he was unambiguously the protector of
their children all things would be
forgiven because women would put their
children above themselves in that
context
so I think he has to take it out of the
frame of women
who are of course thinking of themselves
as we all think of ourselves and move it
to children
where we all we all release our
somewhat instinctively and biologically
we release our self-interest when it
comes to children
because we we figured rightly that the
children are the greatest self-interest
as well as interest
um yeah he doesn't have to he doesn't
have to convince every mother
I think what he has to convince mothers
is that
reparations for women oh my God
reparations for women
oh my God
he would he would never recommend that
but it's such a Weasley play
he could form a commission
he can do a Newsome form a commission of
women to look into giving reparations to
women
and then just never make a decision
the Newsome play
all right
because he doesn't have a chance
um you know that Ukrainian
counter-offensive
very close
very very two fairies
it used to be close
and then it was very close but now it's
very very soon very very soon
and already you can see the uh
the media narrative propaganda forming
so you can see the the seeds of the
propaganda and it's going to go like
this
so the Ukrainian counter-offensive has
not started at least according to
zielinski it hasn't even started but
there's still intense fighting around
back boot
now you're seeing stories that are
different versions of this story
Russians retreating
right
watch how often you see a story of
Russians retreating
now do you think that in the back and
forth of a tense war in which the sides
are roughly equal you don't think I
could get video of ukrainians retreating
you think there are no ukrainians who
ever retreated
no no Ukrainian ever backed up
to you know regroup to fight a fight
again
right but every time every time the
Russians move from one place to another
it doesn't matter what direction it is
if they're hurrying
or they're all moving and then and you
hear gunfire
you're gonna see a video of them
retreating they're all retreating
no maybe they're just relocating
you know maybe they're getting a better
position right so
watch out for all the the Russia's
retreating narrative I don't think it's
real
it looks like that's what the you know
the intelligence people have decided is
going to be the narrative because you
can see the seeds of it already getting
everybody primed oh yeah those Russians
you know is it the Wagner group that's
going to be retreating more or with all
their terrible CR you know criminal
conscripts or is it going to be the
regular Russian army that's retreating
more which one is it which of those
Russians is retreating the most and then
they make you think past the sale if
you're arguing about which version is
retreating the most you've already
accepted that Russians are retreaters
a bunch of retreaters
so I'm not sure how much I believe
anything during the counter-offensive
when the counter offensive starts don't
believe anything
for a long time
you you know short of an actual peace
deal
I wouldn't believe anything about the
reporting on the the military on the
ground for the next uh three months at
least it's going to be just complete
garbage reporting
yeah Wagner group is going to be
variously winning everything and losing
everything
the Russian army is going to be in
control but also retreating for about
three months
yeah but I will say again that Trump
changed it from a war into a negotiation
and
am I the only person who said that out
loud so far
have you heard anybody else say that
because during the town hall
when he said he would end it on day one
when he came into office
he basically said the war is over we've
entered the negotiation phase
so all of the fighting that's happening
is just to get a better negotiated
settlement it's not about winning
they are no longer trying to win
Tim Poole always always beats me did Tim
Poole say that
I will give him credit if he did
all right um
all right well
so uh the uh California reparations uh
group is at it again
and they had such good success with
their earlier recommendations about
reparations that they decided to add to
it a new element
I think this is totally going in the
right direction don't you
listen to this
let's see if you can make your head not
explode
and this is the perfect example of why
Newsome is playing this like a like a
master musician
he is playing these people like a fiddle
because he's letting them go too far
and that allows them to ignore them
right so he's letting them go way too
far he's putting no control on them
whatsoever which is brilliant right he's
not he's not saying you know if you
could maybe cut that back a little bit I
could support it
don't you think that phone call never
happened
well let me tell you what the newest
recommendation is and you tell me if he
is productively talking to this group
or if he's letting them be as crazy as
possible so he can ignore them
so their latest thing the task force is
calling for the state legislature to
require all cities and counties with
allegedly segregated neighborhoods to
submit all the real estate
um
all the real estate uh
ordinances to a state agency for
approval based on whether they maintain
or lessened residential racial
segregation
so now they're going after your
neighborhood
and I kind of love this because the
crazier it gets
the more we can put it in its proper
place which is it was just a prank on
black people basically by Newsom
newsom's playing the biggest prank on
black Americans I've ever seen in my
life
he actually hasn't convinced that he's
serious about some of this stuff
I don't think so I don't think so
yeah it's kind of cruel
foreign
why is he doing it because in the short
run it looks like he's very woke
and in the long run he doesn't have to
worry about it
he'll just keep putting it off
he can put it off forever because
they're always going to be willing to go
back to the task force and talk some
more about some more stuff that they can
get
and then he'll just say well not quite
there
yeah maybe work on that a little bit
harder
10 years later
what would be the Fallout if he executed
on some of this it depends what some is
if this turned into
um
five thousand dollars per black person
in California
I think people would say ah
I have something to complain about
but it's not going to break the bank
so you can you can imagine some you know
trivial
saying that everybody would argue about
but we wouldn't go nuclear about it
however if it turned out to be something
like a million dollars in a free house
for black people
uh
is I I guess I guess all I can say is it
can't happen
because the potential Fallout would be
so extraordinary that it would be
unpredictable
I don't think I could stay at the state
if that happened and I really really
don't want to leave because you know
once you get settled it's just too hard
to leave
but that would just feel too far
like if they started scratching my money
out of my bank account for they
just made up
for people who weren't word slaves
I mean that's too far that's just too
far
and I think the I think the the two
words to and far
we need to use more
because almost everything that starts as
a good idea morphs into some ridiculous
thing
and and you got to be able to say where
too far is if you keep saying well it
was a good idea when it started I don't
want to change my mind that's not
helping how about it's a good idea on
the small
but then it morphed into something
that's too far
and and you got to call it now calling
it as being too far could get you
canceled but apparently there are enough
of us who are willing to get canceled to
tell the truth at least they're looking
out there
uh Charleston South Carolina is that a
good place Sullivan's Island somebody's
recommending I don't like to be where
there are hurricanes
that's my problem with Florida too many
natural disasters
yeah
you know maybe maybe Trump could make
reparations go away by suggesting them
for women
but also not be serious about it
it would be an interesting uh little
thing to throw in the mix there
all right
ladies and gentlemen that is the news
for today
um
California has perfect weather yeah
kind of does
well you know in California you can
avoid it's such a big state
I can avoid the freedom grappers
I can go where there are no earthquake
faults I can build a home that's you
know hardened to them I can build my
house so it's not easy to burn and it's
not in a high burnable area
and I don't have any mudslides where I
live right it's not really a risk in my
specific neighborhood so even though uh
California has like every kind of risk
you know Tahoe has too much snow you
could die in the snow I just don't go to
Tahoe
so all of those risks everything from
you know crime on the streets in in La I
don't go on the sidewalk in Los Angeles
I just don't go there
so it's not really a problem you know I
didn't want to go there anyway
so not a problem at all
is there another UAP why are you saying
that
now my understanding of San Francisco is
that it tends to be cyclical
San Francisco has gone through some high
crime and low crime periods I think near
New York City as well so it could be
just cyclical
I mean it could be that it just slides
too far in One Direction that it goes
back the other way that's probably what
we're going to see
all right ladies and gentlemen
um
that
Home Depot yeah the Home Depot Home
Depot employee was killed near me that
is true
that's the store I shop at
he was shot dead
and right in front of the store I shot
that
all right so that's all for now and I
will talk to you maybe tonight maybe do
a man cave tonight
um
and uh
but I'll definitely see you in the
morning all right see you later YouTube
