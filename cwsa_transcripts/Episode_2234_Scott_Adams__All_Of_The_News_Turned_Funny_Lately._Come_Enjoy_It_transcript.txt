foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I
don't think there's better nicer better
sexier time
than this
but amazingly you could take it to
another level yeah yeah there's another
level after this you know you need to
reach that extra level
is a cup or a bugger a glass detector
Chelsea Style on the canteen jungle
flask a festival of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dope being hit of the
day the thing makes everything better
it's called
go
well
there was a gentleman with a Ukrainian
flag in his bio
who wanted to mock me by saying Scott
says Scott
what happened to Dilbert so so what
happened to Dilbert
totally got me
well for those of you who don't know
Dilbert does run
by a subscription both on the X platform
hit the Subscribe button or on the
locals platform if you want your
politics and your Comics as well
but I want to read you today's comic
because apparently this was missed by
the Ukrainian flag gentleman and you can
see that starts with Dilbert just
talking to uh
Dilbert's just talking to his boss there
and he just says
the boss says Dilbert I'm transferring
you to our chemtrail secret project
and dilber says Chemtrails are real
and the boss says all conspiracy
theories are real and dilber says what
and then Dilbert follows the boss down
the hallway because he's wondering
what's going on he says
was the moon landing faked
and the boy says let me answer that
answer your question with a question he
opens the door
he shows a scene of a lunar Landing says
ever wonder why we have a conference
room that looks like a lunar landscape
and dilber says stop it
my ad is going to explode
and the final panel
the boss is looking at his phone he says
Michelle Obama keeps sending me dick
pics
and his head explodes
so that's what you're missing
now the question you might ask yourself
is
would that have run in newspapers Scott
if you were still in newspapers would
they have said that looks good we'll run
that comic
probably not
probably not so that's what you're
missing Mr Ukrainian flag
if you'd like to know where it went
it improved
that's why I charge for it
if I still wrote the crappy comic you
saw in the newspaper it would be free
but if you want the good stuff
anyway
here's the news China has developed a
tractor beam
where they can move things at a distance
especially in space
they actually built a tractor beam they
don't call it that they call it
something else but some kind of plasma
magnetic thing where they could
potentially you know move a satellite
around in space
now
apparently it only works from like a
mile away but it could work from further
and especially if it's in space
so are you worried about the Chinese
tractor beam
I would say it's a little bit too early
to worry about the tractor beam
but wouldn't it be great if both sides
had a tractor beam and you went to war
and you'd be like
you you take your gun also fly out of
your hands up to space you're like damn
it damn it you grab your hand grenade
you throw your hand grenade it gets
about halfway there and then it goes
up into space
yeah the tractor beam would make all all
wars more fun
you'd just be like shooting at people
and your bullets would go
right up to space
everybody would live you could have an
entire War where there are no injuries
all your weapons would just go up into
space the tractor people would get them
because I don't think it works on people
it only works on
uh magnetic things
so you'd probably have to fight with you
know clubs and
fire and stuff
but that'd be fun
all right here my theme for today
is let me explain how humor works and
how it applies to the news
if I'm going to write a joke
about a real thing in life that you've
all experienced if the only thing I do
is ex is describe it exactly as it
really is
it's not very funny
it's just a description but if you
exaggerate a little bit
well it's still not really funny it's
just an exaggeration but if you
exaggerate more until it's like really
crazy
almost you're almost there it's not
quite humor but you're almost there
if you really really exaggerate it so
it's so ridiculous your brain just has a
has like a hiccup when it looks at it
because it's so stupid
that's a joke
the news by its natural just existence
and the way it's designed has now
progressed from well that's a that's an
unusual news story that's seems slightly
heightened
a little bit exaggerated from what I was
expecting a little bit more than I
expected
and then it went to whoa that's
certainly surprising but wow wow I guess
that really happened that's surprising
and then it went to
did that really happen
I feel like I feel like maybe that
didn't really happen
but you're not quite laughing yet
you're just confused it's like really
really did the the president actually
said drink bleach really
and you're wondering like what's going
on here you're just sort of confused but
if you just wait if you would just be
patient for for a while people people if
you would just be patient
the news would accommodate you by going
so far into absurdity
that you could no longer miss that it
was all a joke
we're there
we're there
all the news is just absurd now it's all
funny
like it could be tragic at the same time
don't get me wrong real people are dying
real people are suffering
but that was happening anyway
the the way the news covers it doesn't
make it better or worse
but I'll tell you one thing
if things are going to be bad we might
as well have a good laugh about it and
today
we can say I'm calling it there's no
difference between the news and humor no
difference
you don't believe me
well let's look at some stories
let's see who did the Democrats put up
for their best
the best Democrats that we have
well there's one that's decomposing
before he's dead
yeah he's actually decomposing now a lot
of people will wait he's also got the
rigor mortis it started already have you
ever seen Biden walk
yeah he's got the rigor mortis walk but
if you haven't seen it looks like this
let me show you a normal walk
you want to see that again normal walk
and now the rigor board is walk
say see those are different normal walk
rigor mortis already said again
like that yeah
so
the Democrats
knowing knowing that the future of the
planet depends on the leader of the
United States to a large degree because
of nuclear weapons and size of the
economy Etc so they decided that the way
to protect Humanity
was to put forward as their champion
somebody who started decomposing before
he actually is technically dead
now
does that sound like actual news or does
that sound like a joke
this sounds like a joke doesn't it if
you were to turn on idiocracy or some
movie that is clearly meant to be a joke
would this be
beyond that level of absurdity
no not it would not be below the level
of absurdity that we routinely consider
humorous exaggeration
but at least at least we have a capable
vice president to back up by oh
no
we actually have the only vice president
that nobody would want to even entertain
at a child's birthday party because they
feel it would embarrass them
is that too far
no the Kamala Harris looks like she
would be embarrassing in every situation
she's had no successes and she's
probably drunk
I don't know that so I can't say that
for sure I can say for sure that she
acts like somebody who's drunk in public
or inebriated in some fashion yeah so we
have somebody who whether or not she is
or not seems indistinguishable from a a
sloppy drunk
and somebody who's indistinguishable
from somebody who's been dead for six
days
basically the same and that's who the
Democrats are running to protect the
world
but at least the Republicans are doing a
serious job right
so we've got the only the oldest
Republican we could find
and the only one who's been impeached
three times and half of the country
thinks he's Heller
so that that's what the Republicans have
decided
that's our champion but
at least the Republicans are playing it
for the right purpose
a lot of people were like hey let's get
a president who's got good policies and
stuff I think Trump actually has good
policies
but that's not really why you have so
much support at the moment
let me just say it it's about revenge
it's about revenge
Trump says it directly and it's exactly
what you're thinking if you're a trump
supporter you are thinking Revenge
because you feel you've been abused
badly for years
it's payback yeah and and the fact that
you don't have to hide it
is hilarious
just think of the absurdity that we can
say out loud that we're you know you
support a candidate for Revenge and that
you can say that non-ironically
non-exaggeratingly it's just a fact it's
a Revenge vote
boy do I want revenge
oh my god do I want revenge
I'd love to tell you I don't you know
I'd love I'd love to tell you I'm so far
above that
oh my God no no we don't want any
Revenge
but you're dealing with seriously broken
and bad people who are in charge of
things
and I'm not sure I would call it Revenge
as much as I'd call it some form of
Justice
but if you want to call it Revenge I'm
happy with that as well
um so that's that's just the Baseline
the Baseline is who we've decided to run
for president
a pre-dead guy
a drunken woman
or at least one that looks wrong
and uh the Revenge guy
the Revenge guy
that so that'll be our contest
does any of this sound like we're a
serious country
does it sound like we're even trying
anymore
no we're not trying
nobody's trying it's just all funny now
we can't tell the difference between
what makes sense and what is just a joke
parody in reality have completely merged
there's no difference
all right um
I've said this before but if you're not
already acting this way I really
recommend it
when you see the this is sort of a
reframe
uh it wasn't too long ago some troll
would come into my mentions on the X
platform
and say something you know evil and bad
about me and that feels oh like I have
to reply to this like this is a person
with an opinion that does not match my
own I must reply
but now I have good pattern recognition
I don't release I think I do everybody
thinks they do done in Krueger but uh my
pattern recognition
has finally created a shortcut
if I see a Ukrainian flag and the the
bio
you can really ignore everything they
say
and I'm not trying to be personal about
it this is a statement about
brainwashing it's not a statement about
the individuals the individuals I see as
purely victims
they have no idea that putting the
Ukraine flag
in their bio is basically telling us
they're fascists
Am I Wrong the Ukraine war is largely
for corporate interests we all know that
right and what it what do you call it
when the government and the corporations
collude so that you can't tell the
difference between the government and
the big corporations that's fascism by
definition
that's that's specifically what it means
it's not like a general statement about
you know you guys are bad so we're using
the word that sounds bad no it's by
definition
specifically the big corporations and
the government operating as one
so that's what the Ukraine is so the
people putting their little Ukraine flag
on there are coming on to acts to call
the Republicans who are not so keen on
having a war there that they're the
fascists
now is that funny or what
it's funny that they're so brainwashed
they don't know that they're the Baddies
they actually don't know that they that
they've been brainwashed by the worst
people on earth
to be to to imagine that they're the
anti-fascists
I mean that's that's beyond just
politics
that's sort of funny
and what I mean is when I see their
little flag
how do you take anything they say
seriously because they're operating
under a complete brainwashing model it's
just a little brainwashing
now I would argue also that the ones who
put their pronouns there
should be discounted for similar reasons
maybe a little different
but anybody with a pronouns there is
going to go along with the crowd would
you agree
putting your pronouns into your profile
says I support whatever you tell me to
support and and I'm going to really
support it because I don't want anybody
to think I don't support why you told me
to support
right so that's a sign of a weak mind in
my opinion
I don't mind that people have pronoun
preferences that's a different a
different subject but if you feel you
need to put it into your profile
well you're signaling a whole different
thing
I'm happy to use whatever Pro pronoun
anybody asked me to that's my standard
for life just in general what would you
like to be called okay
yeah but when I give you your profile
that's a sign of
something wrong there's something wrong
going on there
all right so
um I just use it as a signal that is
somebody who believes the news is still
real
imagine having a Ukraine flag in your
profile
and also believing that the news just in
general
is actually real
that's not funny to you
it's not funny that people actually
believe the news is real
it's kind of funny it used to be
frustrating because I'd say ah don't you
know how do you not know the news isn't
real but now it's just funny
like I see them as victims we're just
like
spitting their wheels and calling me bad
names and stuff
well we're going to have to talk about
Russell Brand
um
would you allow that I could make this
story all about me
because that's what we do
right the the important thing is that
when there's a tragedy or or bad news
happens to anybody
we need to find a way to make it about
ourselves because because in fact that's
how we judge everything
you know as funny as it sounds it's also
the only way people think the only way
we evaluate anything
is compared to ourselves
so we're always doing it just some
people say they're out loud
all right let me make it about myself
I would I am scheduled to be on Russell
Brand's podcast
do you talk about my new book
reframe your brain the most powerful
book in the country right now
and
let's take a vote
so most of you've been watching the news
you've seen the accusations we'll talk
about those
do you think that that podcast is going
to happen
do you think it's just going to be
business as usual and you'll just do the
podcast
I don't know
we hope so
but we don't know
yeah I don't know I think it depends
what his staff does
I think if the staff that supports them
still supports them that it will happen
and if his staff does not support him
then it won't
but we don't know if they're learning
anything they didn't know and if it
makes any difference to them
have I ever told you
um that the news about public figures is
complete the sentence
the news about public figures
is always
there's always false yeah so if you're
looking at the Russell Brand Story and
you're asking yourself how much of this
is true
I could give you the answer without
knowing anything about it
it's always it's always out of context
now that doesn't mean that any of the
individual anecdotes didn't happen
if you will allow I'm not going to
defend Russell Brands and sex life wait
is everybody okay with that I'm not
going to defend Russell Brand's sex life
like I can't think of anything I would
less want to support
that that is none of my business right
we definitely care about the law
and we would definitely care that there
are no victims that would be your ideal
situation but I'm not going to defend
this sex life because he doesn't defend
it himself I mean Beyond it was
completely legal that's what he's saying
but he's not saying he was a good person
I mean he sought treatment for sex
addiction and that's who does that like
who seeks
who seeks a treatment for sex addiction
unless you've really got a problem would
you agree
because I would say that being a
celebrity who could have sex with 80
women a month which is apparently
something he might have claimed once
that doesn't feel like a problem
so much as a perfect life for some
people
so the fact that he even recognized that
as enough of a problem to seek
professional help
suggests that uh he's not defending the
sex life beyond the fact that it was
legal in his opinion
now
have I told you about the accusations
that I've received
from people I've literally never met
literally never met live in other
countries yeah there are people who make
very detailed sexual allegations about
me
at a fairly regular basis who I've never
met
some I have met and then they have
stories that are amazing
yeah
so
uh
from my perspective
when I read a story that's very detailed
and there's a specific person and maybe
they put a name on it and you know there
might even be another another person who
backs up some part of the story that
sort of thing none of it is credible to
me
because I've I've lived through the
other side of it I know that you can
have all kinds of detail from a real
person
that doesn't mean anything
now I'm not saying that these people are
lying I'm saying I don't know
and I'm saying that the context is the
news about public figures
really never is true in in completeness
elements can be true but certainly the
context would be removed
for example
you're hearing that he had a long-term
sexual affair with a 16 year old
do you know how long it takes you to
read the article before it gets to the
point where 16 is the legal age for sex
in the country that he was in Great
Britain
that was legal
don't you think that saying it's legal
should have been somewhere near the top
as then you know he's alleged to have
done this with a 16 year old and again
just just to make sure make sure
everybody's on the same page I'm not
defending him
I'm just describing the situation right
he has to defend himself nobody else can
do that
but I I feel like that would be a proper
context
yes you can have bad feelings about what
he did perfectly you know that's your
opinion
but
you need to say it's legal first
that needs to be right at the top
right
and apparently the indication is that he
was checking to make sure that she was
really 16 again I'm not defending it I'm
just saying that the evidence suggests
he was trying hard not to break the law
and he knew what the law was
for what for whatever that's worse I
think that just needs to be somewhere in
the top of the story
now there were other women who made
accusations that he uh didn't take no as
no
so it's not like you raped them with a
gun or a knife but he's a very big guy
and the claims are that he didn't take
no and forced himself
uh on some women who felt bad afterwards
now
do you think that a story like that
you can trust
by hearing one person's side of it
not by its nature again
you should definitely take Serious any
accusations because they're serious
accusations so you have to take them
seriously I think we'd all agree with
that
but when you're trying to decide what's
true
just hold it in your mind that you've so
far heard one person's narrative
and we know that from watching
documentaries for example if you see one
person's narrative about anything it's
very convincing
any any one-person narrative without the
other side very very persuasive so you
wake up this morning and you see the
narrative from one side and you say well
now I know what happened
do you
do you really
I doubt it
and here's another thing that probably
nobody would be dumb enough to say
except me
have you ever known anybody who is six
foot four and good looking like a guy it
was also really horny
do you know how much sex a six foot four
horny single guy has
the stories that I've heard is that
basically every woman says yes
and you don't even have to necessarily
get them home
like it's in the parking lot it's in the
car
if you're six foot four and good looking
and you're really horny and aggressive
you basically everything that moves
that's been that's what I hear from
people who are in that situation they
can just anything that moves
now
if you were that person
do you think you'd have trouble knowing
where the line was
how would you know where the line was
because let me tell you this as a near
certainty
my guess is that some large percentage
of those women said no
while it was happening
I'll bet you and they were probably
thinking something along the lines of
not yet or I don't know you or this
isn't the way I wanted to do it
but then when it was over
brag to their friends that they had sex
with Russell Brandt do you think that's
ever happened
do you think ever there was a woman who
was definitely saying no
but when it was over she was like ah it
was pretty good
well brag to my friends about this
do you think that ever happened
probably almost certainly
because women are complicated and they
change their minds in any given moment
it's hard to read what they want Etc so
unto this condition
what are the odds that he went too far
at least once
and and definitely there was a line
there but he wasn't hearing it as
different from the last hundred times if
a hundred times in a row a woman said no
but then later she said that was pretty
good actually I'm glad I didn't wait
then they wouldn't say that but but
let's say it didn't go poorly
a hundred times in a row
if you get to 101 and it's really you
really did cross the line would you know
it
would you necessarily know it while it
was happening especially if you're on
drugs for example I don't know if that
was the case
but
all right so I'm not going to defend
them
because the law is the law and the you
know victims have to be
have to be taken seriously but I would
like to say that if you think you know
anything about what happened
you you would be doing a lot of mind
reading and making a lot of assumptions
that are 100 false all the time which is
that you know what's happening in a
celebrity's life you really don't
so have I have I threaded the needle
that The credibility of the story has to
be considered low but at the same time
you have to take it seriously and those
are not inconsistent
you can take it deadly serious 100
percent while at the same time
understanding it's in a class of stories
the generally or low credibility
but that doesn't mean you don't take it
seriously I want to say that as many
times as I need to
all right
so
um
that's happening
and uh
RFK Jr's got a war on plastic
he's going after plastic now I think
I've got mixed feelings about this
because I do have discomfort with all
the plastic in our our food supply and
water and all that
on the other hand the way he wants to go
after it it includes Banning fracking
and not subsidizing plastic and you know
getting some experts to study it and it
basically really
tightening down on it and looking for
Alternatives and removing plastic
from our experience
could even or at least as much as
possible do you think you could even do
that
how in the world would you get rid of
plastic
yeah this doesn't feel
practical
um
here here's what I would have accepted
keep doing what you're doing because we
need to keep the economy running
but at the same time maybe you could
fund uh you know plastic cleanup maybe
you could fund a plastic study to find
out how dangerous it is maybe you could
fund treatments if there's any kind of
treatment to remove it from your body
maybe you could fund uh Alternatives
somebody to invent a you know a safer
alternative those all make sense
those all make sense
but going for the fracking before you've
got Replacements that feels backwards I
feel you get get The Replacements first
and then maybe get rid of your flat
fracking if you still want to
all right
um you should be following Mike Ben's
Benz on uh on the X platform
uh he's got some real gems especially
about intelligence
community and here's one that I like
in 1954
apparently we know now because you know
we know we know what the CID CIA did in
the past if you wait long enough it all
comes out so we know that in 1954 the
CIA engineered a coup in Guatemala and
the Guatemalan government found out
that the CIA had organized the coup or
maybe they just found out it was a coup
and so the people involved in the coup
sent a
recommendation
to their handlers and the recommendation
was in writing so they actually have
this in writing it was an item on a
checklist that said quote if possible
fabricate a big human interest story
like flying saucers birth sectuplets and
remote areas to take play away
in 1954
an element of our government at least
considered
doing UFO stories to divert from CIA
activities
um on September 13 of this year El
Chapo's wife was released from custody
which probably a lot of you thought huh
I have many questions about this why
would El Chapo's wife be released on the
same day
UFO at the headline said UFO expert
displays supposed non-human alien
corpses in Mexico's Congress
so apparently
apparently using UFO stories to divert
you from intelligence agency activities
feels like that's just a standard op
P let me ask you this
why is so much fentanyl coming into the
United States and why are we doing so
little to stop it except we do seem to
be doing something with China's supplier
it feels like we're doing more in China
than we're doing
with the cartels well I would say that
there's an obvious answer there there
must be some powerful force
in the United States maybe Congress
maybe the intelligence community and
therefore Congress has to go along who
wants the fentanyl to be coming in
exactly the way it is
this can't be seen as an accident or
incompetence would you agree that we've
been watching the Fentanyl slow-ins
as such a rate that it cannot be
explained by we want to stop it but we
don't know how
would you agree at this point it's super
obvious that whoever controls our
government wants the fentanyl to come in
now you know people say oh it's
that's how the CIA secretly funds Itself
by supporting the cartels and making
some money that way
maybe I know that doesn't sound out of
that would not be out of the ordinary
but I don't know I don't have any
evidence of that so I don't know if it's
the intelligence community
uh but what else could it be
unless the cartels have Direct Control
of enough members of Congress that they
can just force a vote any way they want
which is possible
what else can it be besides the
intelligence Community wants it to come
in
I can't think of any other Alternatives
because if you're telling me that even
Biden couldn't figure out how to stop
the flow of Fentanyl I'm pretty sure he
could
because he has people who work for him
you don't think that there's anybody on
Border Patrol
Who would know how to stop the fentanyl
or at least slow it down
of course they do
of course they do you don't think our
military doesn't have snipers
you just put a sniper on the border and
take out all of the human traffickers
who are you know letting the people flow
across you just take drop them where
they stand there are a million ways to
stop uh the illegal flow of people and
the illegal flow of of Fentanyl
now
so at this point don't don't you say
that it's obviously a policy
and it must be democrat-led
but you have to wonder why Trump
couldn't do anything about it
if Trump couldn't do anything about it
that's just it's somewhere else in in
the government because I'm pretty sure
Trump does not want fentanyl coming into
the country all right can we all agree
that there's no chance
no chance
the Trump wants any fentanyl to come
into this country there's no chance
but he couldn't stop it you didn't even
slow it down
that suggests there's somebody more
important than the president at any
given time who is in control of that
issue
who would be more important who would
have more control than the president of
the United States in the United States
the Deep State and and the intelligence
groups
I mean what else could it be
so process of elimination
um the simulation is making us laugh
with this interview ABC News was
interviewing Anthony blinken
and blinken was asked about these new
long-range missiles the U.S is giving to
Ukraine and it says the question was
um are you okay if Ukraine uses those
missiles to strike deep into Russia
and blinken said and here's the funny
part
he said it without blinking
blinken didn't blink
and he looked like he was in a hostage
video
you have to you have to see it he looks
like he's in a hostage video he does not
look like that's his opinion
because his eyes don't blink and he
looks at the camera and he goes
uh well that's uh the the targeting
that's uh that that would be a their
decision
not ours
okay I may have exaggerated that a
little bit but he looked uncomfortable
and I think he knows that this could
start World War III or a nuclear war
and I don't think he's happy about it
so what's going on
it doesn't sound like blinking
is on the inside track of people who
have any power
I feel like he was just sent out to
explain something that can't be
explained
we also saw there's some question about
Tom Cotton who came out publicly and
said you know yes we have to
support Ukraine
so that they can win
win
Tom Cotton
Tom Cotton has been watching the Ukraine
Russia situation
and believes does he actually believe
that they could win
and what would winning look like
but use that word win as if that were
one of our options I didn't know winning
was an option when did winning become
even one of the possibilities
I mean early on you could have said well
anything could happen but at this point
there isn't any winning
what kind of winning could you have
possibly
so I've seen people question his
independence if you know what I mean
and I would question it as well
I would think that there are some big
questions to have to be asked here
about why that is his opinion and the
thing is that
is well understood as a reasonable
person
so that it's not tracking wait what why
would a reasonable person say Ukraine
could win if we give them more money
that doesn't sound reasonable
a reasonable person would be saying
something like well it looks like
there's a stalemate so everybody who
dies from this point on is a waste of
death so let's just wrap this up that
one said that's what a rational person
would say so why would Tom Cotton
appear to be on the side of something
that's irrational
you know what it feels like
it feels like a hostage tape again
like I I feel like uh let me just put
that out there the that opinion seemed
so opposite of what I'd expect from Tom
Cotton that I feel like he was signaling
it was under duress
what do you think
like it was almost like he's trying to
tell us that that's not his real opinion
because going all the way to wind
just doesn't sound like something that
would really come out of his mouth in
the real world it sounds like he's
sending us a signal that it's under
duress
right
so both blinken and
Tom Cotton both are acting like people
who don't
are not on the page but want you to know
it I swear to God even blink it looked
like he was signaling
I don't really believe this
uh well it's totally up to the
ukrainians to do the targeting
I mean seriously
um
all right so that was funny watching
them be do hostage videos and so Joy
Behar on The View
says that the young Republicans are are
stupid to use her word
uh and she even said that Vivek was
stupid while mispronouncing his name
and I like to see Vivek ramaswamy
take an IQ test at the same time as Joy
Behar uh while we watch I'll just sit
there for half an hour or whatever it
takes them to do the test and then we'll
just grade them
and then compare
can you even imagine
Joy Behar
calling the vague stupid
uh
uh like isn't that Beyond
now remember my definition of humor
is that is that a small definite is that
like a small exaggeration
no
is that is it like a really big
exaggeration
it's not even that
it's all the way to bat crazy
so it's just funny
how could you take seriously Joy Behar
calling the probably the smartest person
who's ever run for president who wasn't
named Thomas Jefferson uh
that he's stupid
what what part of her brain that little
p in there
get gets her to that point of view
you know I would have respected her
opinion if she says something like this
well some of them are very smart
but I worry that they have the wrong
motives or they've been brainwashed or
they're you know just part of the
team play or something like that those
things would make some sense
but to call the smartest person we've
seen in modern times running for
president and to say that he's literally
stupid compared to the people on The
View and Their audience is pretty funny
pretty funny
can you imagine the view if that ran
during the the time of the founding of
the country
yeah well George Washington is obviously
a warmonger and Madison and Jefferson
two little idiots two stupid
people
yeah that would be the view back in 1770
whatever all right
um I I've heard some people say that the
video of uh representative bobert
having some handsy fun with her date and
in that theater
um some some are saying that the
Democrat that she is seeing he's a
Democrat they say a bar owner and
they're saying it must be a setup
because he's a Democrat and he did it in
public to you know sort of embarrass her
now
I've got some questions
um is it true that uh
men who are Democrat won't do
heterosexual stuff unless you pay them
is that is that sort of what you're
thinking
it's like all right we're gonna have to
get we're gonna have to set up this
representative bobert but we're going to
need a heterosexual
and they looked around and like all
right
no no not a Republican and somebody says
all right could we get
um
you know maybe we could get
Stephen Miller no no no you can't have a
republican no Republicans we're gonna
have to get a Democrat but we need this
Democrat to do heterosexual stuff
they're like how are we going to get
them to do that like money
maybe for money
you know some some people some Democrats
will go non-gay for money
so they got a Democrat to do some
heterosexual stuff on camera uh to uh to
frame her
hey come on this is funny it's funny
that they had to pay a Democrat to act
heterosexual that's just funny
all right it's not really what happened
but it's funny to think about it
and here's the other question I asked is
that what heterosexual man
would have to be paid money
to want to fill up bober in a theater
I don't know nobody's offered me any
money and if there's any kind of a line
I would get in it
you know I usually don't like to travel
you know but if it were an option
I would even pay for the ticket
but uh yeah I think most heterosexual
men would like to take her to the
theater
so I don't think it's a setup
um all right
um what do you call it there's a
political term I'm looking for and I I
couldn't think of it when I was getting
ready for the there's a political term
for this what do they call it when uh
let's say if Feinstein either retires or
has moved from office and then Alan
Schiff or Adam Schiff becomes appointed
what is that called
there's a word for it
where if if Feinstein retired like
before the end of a term and then Gavin
Newsom
no there's a word for it oh I know the
murder the word is it's a lateral move
it's a lateral move
if the one whose brain dead leaves and
they put in Adam Schiff that's called
the political term is a lateral move
see everything's funny
they're actually looking to replace
Feinstein with Adam Schiff
and honest to God that looks like a
lateral move to me
how can it be worse
the only way as worse is they found
somebody who's brain dead who still
talks
they got somebody who's brain dead who
doesn't talk so much so I need a brain
dead person who talks it's like well it
feels like an upgrade
all right
um
did you see that you all saw that
probably the viral video that's not on
the news
but all over Twitter of two uh young men
who murdered a guy on a bicycle
uh intentionally you could see the whole
thing developing as they're talking
about it in the car and as they target
him and kill him and he turned out to be
a retired ex-police chief
um
the Las Vegas Review Journal
their headline the way they described it
was that he was killed in a bike crash
he was killed in a bike crash
they didn't say two young black men
targeted him and murdered him
which is actually what happened
but
is the fact that they were black
important to the story
no
because individuals are infinitely
different
as soon as you buy into the The
Narrative that there's like an average
black person
and you should compare that to the
average white person
you're already gone they already got you
don't ever buy into the narrative that
comparing the average of any two groups
gets you anything except canceled
that's all you're gonna get
rather you should say there are two
individuals that are such horrible
people we would all like to see them
murdered in a terrible way
okay not all of us but I would I'd like
to see them get murdered
because they're terrible terrible people
which has nothing to do with their DNA
but it might have something to do with
the the way the news is being presented
to all of us that may that may devalue
some people's lives more than others
some people's lives may be devalued by
the news
so that's important to know but what's
not important to know
is that there were two terrible people
but the Las Vegas Review Journal is a
newspaper
and when they completely hide the news
by calling a killed in a bike crash but
yet I'm sure they made a big deal about
George Floyd I don't I don't have to
jack of course they did
um
people ask me Scott
how do you feel now that you're no
longer associated with the newspaper
industry
well let me tell you how would you feel
the the newspaper industry just referred
to this as somebody killed in a bike
crash
how would you feel if you were no longer
associated with them
 good
like a really good like really really
really good I got to tell you it was a
struggle
to have the Washington Post carry my
comic
because you know I didn't want to make
waves
I mean I was criticizing The Washington
Post you know pretty vigorously the
entire time so I knew I knew my time in
the Washington Post was limited I didn't
know that they would all cancel me at
the same time but I knew the Washington
Post would have to get rid of me they
just needed to do it under cover of
everybody else doing it at the same time
but obviously they had to get rid of me
so yeah I feel pretty good about not
being part of that
um
I guess uh Meet the Press
did a interview with uh Trump that's
pre-taped does that mean we'll see that
today
are we going to see Trump on Meet the
Press
well here's what Jane Powers writes on
acts James must be a Democrat Jessica
she tweets this Hey NBC News
and Meet the Press pull the plug on the
disastrous Trump interview if it's
pre-taped just don't air it so in other
words Jane has not seen the interview
has not seen the interview
because it's if but if it's pre-taped
it's disastrous and it should be pulled
uh it is awful and I guess the new host
is named Welker is awful and Welker
ought to be ashamed of herself boycott
Meet the Press
so the Democrats literally don't even
want news
they don't want the news to do the news
and they they say it kind of directly
now that you can't even listen to Trump
that the problem is freedom freedom of
speech itself
if you have freedom of speech and a free
press those things are considered
threatening to the left
freedom of speech and Free Press
are threats to the left
but they know it you know I'll give them
credit they know that if they don't
control the media
they lose
because the narrative is not going to
support the ridiculous things that
they're claiming and acting on
so
let's see uh if there are any other
situations like that
um
let's say is there any other situation
in which Democrats are trying to squelch
free speech and the News well there's
the Russell Brand situation which you
could say oh no it's not about that
that's about his behavior but
interestingly his behavior didn't matter
to anybody until he became well known
for debunking the mainstream media
narrative
but now suddenly his his past behavior
is very sketchy and now we've got to do
something so does this look like a
normal progression of the legal system
or does it look like an attempt to
reduce free speech
could be both but at the very least
it would decrease free speech
what about Tucker Carlson getting fired
from Fox
do you think that was
a way to reduce free speech
of course it was it may not work out but
that's what it was what about Assange
in jail
that's about Free Speech but Republicans
like that too Assange is in jail because
even Trump thought he should be in jail
so I'm not going to use him
how about
the ADL trying to destroy the business
model of Twitter now Acts because
Twitter was going to be a free speech
platform
does that look like somebody's afraid of
free speech
well the story would be that there's too
much hate and anti-Semitism but the data
doesn't show that so it's interesting
there's always a cover story isn't there
now we're not trying to just no no no
we're not trying to stop Russell Brand
from speaking
he just did some bad sex things we think
years ago that's what we care about
no no Tucker Tucker Carlson is not being
removed from the air because he's
effective no no it's not not about
Supreme Free Speech no it's because he
said some things that were not true
about an election we think and we got
assume that cost us a lot of money and
that's the reason yeah
that's the reason
and what about uh the gag order on Trump
from uh Smith the prosecutor do you
think the gag order on Trump who's
running for president whose primary uh I
would say your strongest focus is the
weaponization of the government
so the weaponized government told them
to shut up about talking about the
weaponized government does it sound like
they did that strictly for good legal
hygiene because sometimes you need to
ask people not to talk it's part of the
you know making sure the process is
incredible
but do you think that's why they did it
or do you think they just want to limit
his Free Speech because what he would
say would be inconvenient for them
what about uh
representative bobert
do you think the problem is that she was
vaping and making some noise in the
theater
or do you think maybe she says things
that some people don't want to hear
what about Christy gnome and Corey
Lewandowski
do you think nobody knew that they were
up to something for a long time
do you think that the reason that now
we're looking at it is because oh
hypocrisy is bad and is that why we're
looking at it now
nope is to shut him the up
um how about me
I got canceled by all the Democrats and
none of the Republicans
is it because the thing I said was so
awful
well the thing I said was awful it was
designed to be awful
but you know of course the point of it
was to be awful so of course it was
awful
but do you think that's why I got
canceled
do you think that's why
probably not
probably if I had been black I could
have said anything I wanted so
we seem to be in a situation in which
100 of the effort on the left is to
prevent you from knowing the news the
entire pandemic was an exercise in
preventing you from knowing what was
true
the Ukraine war is a huge exercise in
preventing you from knowing what's true
the fentanyl um
whatever fentanyl stuff we're doing is
clearly not real in the sense that
whatever is the truth we are prevented
from knowing
whatever is the situation with these
 UFOs
were prevented from knowing the UFO
story is not about uh getting to the
bottom of it it's literally about
fooling you so you don't see the real
news
right everything that's happening is an
effort to take away your information and
your freedom of speech everything it's
just that everything can be couched as a
different thing and you wouldn't notice
until you saw the pattern if you look at
any one of these stories individually
you'd say well
leave me alone Russell Brandon some bad
things like that's the whole story
right or if you only saw a Tucker you
say well it was just a business decision
it was a business
or if you only saw me
you'd say well look what he said and
look what he said obviously
and if you didn't know that it was only
Democrats
so
I think the pattern is pretty clear
the left seems to be completely aware
that if they let the truth get out they
couldn't they couldn't be in charge why
do why does the left create fact fake
fact Checkers and pretend that they're
real
because if real ones were there their
whole game would be uncovered so they
have to have fake fact checkers
because they're protecting the fake news
yeah so 100 of everything that the
Democrats are doing is to make sure you
don't know what the Democrats are doing
that's the whole game
now I don't know that that's exactly the
same for the Republicans
I mean I'm sure that there's a lot of
 in the Republican party I'm sure
there's a lot of and lying of
course because it's politics but I don't
really see the Republicans trying to
remove
free speech and information from you
have you ever seen a republican say uh
I I think well you know actually the
public says CNN should go out of
business but you don't really think that
you'd rather they cover the news
if they're not going to really cover the
news and going out of business is
actually the first choice but it's only
because they're not covering the news
nobody wants CNN to go on a business if
they cover the news
that's not even a thing it's only
because they don't cover the news and
they aggressively don't cover it like
they really make sure they don't cover
it if you know what I mean
at least the context that would matter
so what a comment is the GOP is
more about dodging taxes and being able
to kill spotted owls for sport
see now that's just a good exaggeration
so you know you can recognize that for
what it is
yeah so we've learned that science was a
way to launder opinion
right science in 2023
science at least the science that has an
impact on our policy not not the basic
science that's just happening in the lab
that's probably fine you know the basic
science that's non-political
it's probably half right and that's as
good as it's ever been but it's all we
got
but the any any science has a direct
impact on policy is just a way to
launder opinion or to launder your money
making schemes
and War of course is a way to use up
your old ammo so you have to buy new and
test out your weapons because nobody
cares about young men especially
can you imagine what what Ukraine would
look like if people cared about the
lives of young men
or men in general
if anybody cared about men there would
be no war in the Ukraine is basically
that it's free
for the ukrainians the only thing
they're spending is mostly
young men
and they were free
and the money that they're spending is
somebody else's they're spending our
money
and they're spending the lives of males
which are free
so it's a free just follow the money if
you're in Ukraine why would you stop
fighting
you don't care about the people who are
dying
there aren't that many civilians dying
at the moment that could get worse but
the moment is mostly military people
dying mostly men nobody cares
yeah that's pretty much the whole story
yeah you you could describe Ukraine in
one sentence
nobody cares if men die
if they did there would be no no
conflict at all
right so I think we got to the point
where we understand that almost
everything Democrats do is a diversion
from letting you know what's happening
now the only way that I would say that
the Republicans are similar there might
be some other examples here I don't want
to make it all one-sided but there might
be some other
some examples such as
the Republicans talk about debt
but they don't seem too serious about it
if you know what I mean
like we've never seen a republican come
up with a budget that would reduce the
debt
have they even tried
now because the thing with the debt is
there will always be the person who
comes after you that will do worse
as long as the administration that
follows you you know is going to do
worse and they will because of that
sound of control
uh that you could say well
look oh do you think Obama's bragging
because Trump added more to the debt of
course do you think Trump's breaking
because
um Biden added more to the debt of
course of course yeah as long as you can
be sure that the next Administration
will be worse
spend whatever he wants free
you'll always be able to say well it's
only half as bad as the current guy so
leave me alone
yeah so our government has created a
situation where they can drive the
country into ruin
will never making it look like it was
their fault
because there'll always be somebody else
to blame
so by Design we should be going out of
business as a country
by Design
not by accident
it's designed to go out of business at
the moment because there's nothing to
stop the debt
if we had something in our system that
could potentially stop the debt from
increasing then I would say um okay
we've got a plan but we actually have a
design to put us out of business
completely
we could change the design but there's I
see no action does anybody see anything
that would even remotely
change the fact that we're flying out of
control in debt I've never seen anything
that wouldn't even remotely get to it
because my understanding is our economy
could never be big enough to pay it back
I don't think there's any scenario where
our economy would ever be big enough to
pay back the debt or even to reduce the
increase in the debt which would give
you the same place
yeah so I don't know unless we do a some
radical shift to bitcoin or something
but I don't know I don't know what the
plan is and I don't know how we even got
this far without going out of business
but maybe other countries are worse
all right
ladies and gentlemen
did I miss any stories
or do they make you so depressed you
can't stand it
sometimes I wonder if I'm too happy
about things people don't like it
because sometimes you want to be angry
or you want somebody to you know share
your anger about what's happening
there's plenty to be angry about
yeah we didn't talk about soup beard
well what is uh Jack Smith is that the
name of the prosecutor Jack Smith
he's got a beard that looks like he has
soup in it but
I don't know just me
oh so yes so in Florida there was an
impeachment I guess the attorney
impeachment attempt against the Attorney
General
Paxton and he was acquitted on all
charges
right acquitted on all charges
um
yeah so do you do you therefore say that
the charges were invalid
because he was acquainted by uh
Republicans
I don't know
I'm not ready to say that he did nothing
I just haven't followed the story
I just know that if you get acquitted by
your own party it doesn't really mean
what you think it means
yeah I have no idea if any of the
charges were real but I do assume that
they were trying to remove him for
because he probably had a real real data
and real information or something I
guess bacho goatee that's funny
all right
um
Susanna Gibson ChatterBait scandal
I don't really care that there was a we
have a politician who was once in sex
work
does anybody care about that
so there's there's some story that I you
know barely followed because I don't
care there's some woman who used to do
some online
you know sex work
but now she's yeah it's the same job I I
would say that she's very qualified
it doesn't mean anything
somebody says she's she's hot but her
performance was lackluster well that
would count against her running for a
public office I I wouldn't want her to I
wouldn't want to know she was bad at it
right if you told me she was good at it
I'd say well that could be a plus for
public office but if she was bad at
being a sex worker online
I'd have to hold that against her
uh the 19th amendment has entered the
chat what's the 19th
remind me what's the 19th
women voted
that's funny
all right
um
I think we've done everything we need to
do for today
have we not
have we not done everything we need to
do I've got some stuff to tell the
locals people
privately after I go private
so thanks for joining YouTube
always a pleasure I'll talk to you soon
bye for now
see you in the morning
