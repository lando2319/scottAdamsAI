Let's check the stock market while
people are streaming in
here and Tesla's way
up. SPY is up. Looks like things are up.
Bitcoin is up. Rumble is
up. And Nvidia is up only a little bit,
huh? Thought thought it would be
more. All right, let's get some comments
going and we'll give you the show. You
damn well
deserve. I know you
[Music]
do. Good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time. But if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains, all
you need for that is a tech jealous
dino, a canteen, sugar, flask, a vessel
of any kind. Also, a cup or mug or a
glass. I should read from the top line.
Maybe not start from the second line.
And join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day.
The thing that makes everything better.
It's called the simultaneous sip. That
happens right now.
Go. So good. Oh, I see the complaining
has
started. We got
complaining
complainers. All
right. So, uh, last I saw, no pope has
been selected. Only the black smoke is
coming out of the little chimney. Did
you know that they add the chimney just
for the picking of the pope? It's not
there all the
time. So now you know. So black smoke
means no pope has been selected yet. Did
you Did you all see the meme on the
internet of orange smoke?
orange smoke coming out of the uh
chimney suggesting that maybe Trump had
been picked as the
pope. That's a pretty good
meme. Well, I hadn't mentioned this, but
you probably saw the story that uh
there's a very large new statue that's
been added to Time Square and it's uh a
black woman. So, I believe the idea was
to celebrate black women.
And but here's the problem with the
black woman uh
statue. Um it turns out that uh like
most things, everything turns political
and you know um the Republicans don't
see color, at least not in the same way.
So, I saw some people in the comments
this morning uh calling it the fat lady
statue. Now, I'm not judging and I, you
know, I don't do fat shaming because I
don't think people are fat because they
want to be.
Um, but that's as big a fail as you can
get if you put up a statue celebrating
black women and half of the country
calls it the fat lady
statue. Oops. Maybe they should have
done a little uh market testing before
they went with that that
model. Anyway, good try.
Um, according apparently there's another
uh UFO sighting according to the Daily
Mail. Um, there was an alien ball that
apparently dropped into Colombia. So,
they have video of it, you know,
traversing the sky, but then they
actually captured it. Now, now they're
looking at it.
And I don't believe I don't believe a
single part of this story, but it's
funny that it even exists. So, it's a
weird metal sphere and uh it's made of
three dense layers and has a chip-like
core, they say, and 18 tiny
microsphheres inside. No welds, no
seams, and no signs. So, humans built
it. It's cold on the outside, but
reportedly hot on the inside. How did
they know that? I'm not sure. And it may
have vaporized
water and has perfect internal
symmetry. And even better, it's
allegedly etched with ancient
runes. And AI says the message is about
unity, energy, and
transformation. Do do you think AI
successfully translated
uh ancient runes from another
planet? Or maybe it's now from another
planet. You may maybe it's part of that
uh ancient civilization on Earth that's
been hiding in the ocean. Anyway, I'm
going to put that in the category of I
don't believe a single part of
it. Well, let's check and see if there's
any science that I can debunk.
Uh according to discover
uh there's a therapy that's uh targeted
at controlling
emotions to help ease chronic pain. So
they used a uh type of therapy on
emotions and they found out that it
seemed to make a big difference in
people's chronic
pain. Well, I'm going to give you the
hypnotist take on that.
It might be that it's exactly what it
what it looks like that if you get rid
of people's emotional pain, it gives
them some relief of their physical pain.
Because as I tell you way too often,
your brain and your body are really the
same thing. You know, we just
artificially treat the brain like it's
separate because it's in your skull. But
it's all kind of one big brain. Your
body and your and your your little
nugget inside your skull.
But uh here's my uh question as a
hypnotist. Is it possible that what
really happened is that they hypnotized
some portion of the people they were
doing the therapy on? Here's how easy it
would be to hypnotize them. We're going
to do a thing where we talk to you and
it's going to be a bunch of scientists,
really smart people, and we're going to
see if it eases your
pain. That's it.
You you could have frauds, you know,
just actors coming in wearing um like
scientific clothes and having glasses
and you know clipboards and stuff and
probably probably you would have a a big
impact on the number of people who said,
"Yeah, you know what? That therapy
really helped me. My emotions are better
and my pain went way down." So, I don't
know how you would do this
experiment unless you could somehow
reduce the the accidental
hypnosis. And the accidental hypnosis
would just be the suggestion that it
might work. Um, you know, it's sort of a
placebo effect on steroids.
One of the tricks uh one of the tricks
of being a hypnotist is if you want to
do it professionally, you need to get an
office and wear a suit and you have
professional furniture and uh you know
even put your diploma on the wall
because if somebody walks into that
environment and it looks all
professional and somebody spent money on
it and there's a diploma, they will get
hypnotized much more easily.
than if it was just your neighbor Bob.
Hey Bob, I hear you're a hypnotist.
Yeah, just sit on this dining room table
and I'll hypnotize you. That would still
work. Yeah, if if Bob is good at it,
that would still work. But, uh, we were
we were trained that you should make it
look like it'll work because it makes it
easier. Um, here's one. Maybe they could
have just asked me and saved a little
time. according to the University of
California of LA in
LA that people who are
curious it might help them stay sharp um
as they get older and keep them from
getting
Alzheimer's. Do you believe that that
people who are
curious are more protected against
Alzheimer's? Yes. That would be
compatible with everything that's ever
been tested about people who might get
Alzheimer's. The more you use your
brain, the less likely you get
Alzheimer's. That's one of the most
commonly studied things you've ever
seen. So, of course, people who are
naturally
curious are going to spend more time
doing intellectual things to satisfy
their curiosity. So, did they really
need to do a study to find that curious
people are more protected from
Alzheimer's? They did not. They could
have just asked me. I would have saved
them a lot of time. Yes. Hm. Curious
people, they would use their brains
more. We're pretty sure that using your
brains more protects you from Alzheimer.
Yes, it will protect you. Got it.
Uh there's another study, Eric Dolan is
writing about this in Cypost. They found
that men tend to uh look at women's
mouths when rating their attractiveness
while women focus more on men's eyes and
hair. Now this again might be exactly
true, but I have questions.
Question number one, did the women and
they were looking at photos. I believe
they were looking at pictures, not
actual people.
Um, did the women in the photos, were
they all wearing
makeup? In other words, were their eyes
all tricked out with eye
makeup? Because one of the things I've
noticed is that pretty much every
woman's eyes look pretty good if they
have eye makeup on. I I don't even know
the words, but what are the right words?
Eye makeup, fake lashes if you need
them, that sort of stuff. So, it seems
like it's a little bit unfair because
it's
unusual to run into anybody whose eyes
are special.
I've seen it. You know, my my last
ex-wife had worldclass eyes. You know,
the kind that give you five million
followers on Instagram. Um, but it's
unusual. Your average person just has
good eyes. Your average
woman just looks great. You know, their
their eyes are just perfect. So, looking
at the eyes isn't telling you a lot.
But here's my
speculation. I believe men are trained
not to make too much eye
contact because it's
intimidating. What do you think? If
you're if you're having a conversation
with a woman, especially one that you
don't know
well, would you spend most of your time
looking into her eyes? Let's say there
wasn't some romantic connection there.
Or would you sort of just naturally know
that as a
male it's intimidating to do too much
eye
contact? I look at the
mouth and and the reason I look at the
mouth is because it's usually moving.
So, it's something to look at. And uh I
do make some judgments about the mouth.
But some of it is I just don't feel
comfortable making too much eye contact
cuz I think the other person would get
weirded out by it. Does anybody have
that same? Anybody have that experience?
I don't know if that's unique to me. All
right. So, I just put that out
there. And uh women look more at men's
eyes and hair.
Now, the other thing is I I don't think
they were allowed to look at anything
but, you know, the face. So, that's a
little
limiting. But, yeah, I like looking at
mouths. I I think there's something to
that
science. And we look we tend men tend to
look where they're allowed to look.
Well, you probably heard that uh
Governor Nuome of California wants to
work with Trump to make uh film great
again in California. So, uh Newsome has
floated the idea of a 7.5 billion
federal tax
credit for filmmakers. to which I asked
the following
question. Why would filmmakers need an
enormous tax credit in order to make
films in
California? I can only think of one
reason. The reason would be that
California has high taxes and high high
problems that they've sort of
artificially created. just everything's
more expensive and this state is just
slamming you in every possible way and
you know you got to watch out for
herming the endangered frogs and you got
to make sure you've got DEI
covered why would the federal government
want to cover the mistakes of the state
and then beyond
that if you have to pay for the industry
to
exist maybe that industry shouldn't
exist maybe that indust industry should
figure out how to make movies more
inexpensively. Now, I do know that there
are uh you know other countries that
give you big tax
breaks and I guess they think they make
their money back because there's a lot
of activity that goes on. But,
uh, I don't automatically think that
subsidizing the movie industry to go
back to the place that they ran
from, even though it's my state and it'd
be good for me. I don't know. And then I
see that the people in favor of it are
Governor Nuomo and Adam
Schiff. If Adam Schiff is in favor of
it, it just automatically feels like a
bad idea.
So, I don't know. Good luck with
that. Well, the White House has picked a
new surgeon general
um whose name is uh Dr. Casey
Means. And uh I guess there was somebody
else who had been nominated who was been
withdrawn. But Trump said that this Dr.
Casey
means um has impeccable Maha
credentials and she'll work well with
RFK Jr. You know, if RFK Jr. thinks
she's the right choice and uh Trump's
happy with her, that's probably good
enough. When was the last time the
surgeon general made a big difference in
the world?
Um, you know, there was a time when the
surgeon general said cigarette smoking
is bad and then that got on the
cigarette pack. So, that was pretty
important. But when was the last time
you
remember the surgeon general made a
difference? Do you remember it was a uh
Joselyn Elders who was a surgeon general
under I don't remember who but she got
in trouble for saying that uh
masturbation was good for
you and you those were simpler
times to which I say probably it is and
uh she got in trouble for saying that. I
can't remember if she said because she
she was a black woman. I can't remember
if she was talking about black women or
women in general, but she said that uh
women weren't getting enough exercise
cuz they worried about their hair. You
remember that? And then everybody mocked
her and said, "Come on, come on. They're
not worried about their hair." And then
there were surveys done. Turns out women
don't exercise as much because it's just
a huge pain in the the butt to get their
hair right. You know, if you don't have
the timing right, you know, you can't do
exercise and have good hair at the same
time. And I thought, wow, she was like
right on target. So Joselyn Elders in my
in my view was sort of the superstar of
Surgeon Generals because she said what
people didn't want to hear and they
weren't ready to hear. But it was right.
So I I always had a lot of respect for
her. I saw there was some push back
um from some smart people saying that
they didn't think that Dr. Casey means
was sufficiently qualified. But I feel
like a a medical
doctor is probably qualified, especially
if they you know that they're in the
Maha camp.
So, I'm going to be open-minded about
that one.
The Stanford Review, which I believe is
a student publication in Stanford, um
they did their own research and they
found that
China is running this enormous spy
operation in Stanford, which suggests
it's probably in every major uh US
college institution. And the way it
works is that if you're a uh a
Chinese student whose nationality is
Chinese, but you know uh it's also your
um country that you were born in. So not
Americans. We're not talking about um
we're not talking about Asian-Americans.
We're talking about people who are going
to school here and then they're going to
go back to China. Apparently, those
students, even if they didn't want to be
spies, they're forced to be
spies. And every single one of them
seems to have a handler, according to
the Stanford Review. And the handler not
only makes sure that they spy, but even
directs them into which classes and
things they should get involved in. So,
the Chinese government would say, "All
right, for example, I'm just making this
up. They'd say, for example, all right,
um, AI is critically important to
China's future. So, you're going to sign
up for the AI class." Well, I don't want
to sign up for the AI class. Well,
you're going to you're going to sign up
for the AI class. All right. And you're
going to tell us everything that you
learn.
So,
uh, don't you assume that this is what's
happening in every major college
institution? I don't see that there's
any way to stop it except for removing
all those students because the students
are guilty,
but I would say uh they're operating
under duress. I doubt there's even one
student who thinks, "Oh, I love doing
this. This sure is fun being a spy." I
I'll bet they're just they just want to
enjoy the college experience and learn
their stuff and go on with their lives.
So, but in any case, they probably pay a
lot for uh for their tuition compared to
other people. So, it's going to be tough
to do anything about
that. Well, did you see the
announcement?
uh from uh OMG, the O'Keefe media group.
James O'Keefe uh scored another big one
and he's got some undercover video of
um a very close confidant to Prince
Andrew and the very drunken close
confidant who was actually uh living
with Prince Andrew's ex-wife and raising
his kids. And uh he wasn't just close,
he was as close as you could get. like
he he was right in the middle of it. So,
this is somebody who definitely
knows what was
up. And according to him in his uh
drunken
um babbling, he said that uh he
confirmed that Prince Andrew was
involved with Epstein and underage
having sex with underage
um females.
Now, on one hand, that is a pretty
amazing
undercover
discovery, and on the other hand, it's
the only thing about Epstein that I was
sure I already knew. Did anybody have
that feeling? Now, just because it
wasn't 100%
confirmed that Prince Andrew had some
sex with at least one person, was it
Virginia Joffrey who was making that
claim? I
forget who recently passed away.
Um, but did you think it was just
one? And did you think I mean it's the
only thing the only thing I knew about
Epstein that I was completely certain I
knew the whole story which was Prince
Andrew was a I don't know a client of
Epstein's or just a friend. But wouldn't
you have been more surprised to find out
that he wasn't doing it? I think it was
exactly what it looked like and we all
knew it for a long time. So, on one
hand, an amazing get to get the
confirmation. On the other hand, why
does all this Epstein seem like we we
keep we keep getting teased that we're
going to hear something new and it's
always something we already
knew. Like, when when is the first new
thing going to be dropped? I don't know.
But still big accomplishment.
Congratulations to O'Keefe.
Um, apparently the uh big victory that
Trump got over the hoodies, getting them
to say that they'll stop attacking
shipping in the Red Sea might be limited
in its actual real world value because
the shippers say, "Uh, we don't quite
trust the hoodies."
Now, how many times have I told you that
if you want to know what reality is,
look at whatever the insurance companies
are doing. And I said to myself, as soon
as, you know, I heard that the hoodies
had claimed that they would stop
attacking, I said to myself, but will
the insurance companies believe it?
Because if the insurance companies don't
believe
it, the ships are just not going to go
there because they they can't get
insured.
So, I don't know if it's strictly
because of insurance problems or if the
shippers on their own are just saying,
"Well, maybe maybe we'll wait and see on
this a little bit." Um, but there there
should be an
advantage coming up at some point, but
uh it won't be fast. However, it does
make it look like Trump got a big
victory before he does his Middle East
trip, which is upcoming. So, politically
terrific. Practically, I don't know yet.
We'll have to wait and
see. Well, here's the big good news, if
I can call it that. Um, apparently the
uh US and the UK are going to announce a
trade deal today. Probably, it's
probably being announced right now. I
think it happens right now. And the idea
is that uh we've reached some kind of an
agreement. Now, I guess we didn't have
the it wasn't the hardest of our trade
deals because there wasn't that much in
dispute. Um and I don't know the details
of it yet, but if both sides are happy,
that probably means there's some
advantage to the US.
And uh that's probably why the stocks
are up in in
part.
[Music]
Um all
right. Just looking at one of your
comments
there. So you remember I told you that
uh the the most predictable thing is
that the press is going to slam Trump on
his whole uh tariff fiasco and the
chaos. But as soon as the deals start
coming in, oh, here we go. Zero Hedge is
reporting that the US is going to cut
tariffs on UKmade cars. The UK makes
cars
um to
10%. And the and the US UK deals to cut
beef tariffs to close to
zero. Beef tariffs in which direction? I
guess our beef to them. But isn't the
problem that they don't like our beef
because it has hormones? Well, so the
next thing I was going to tell you, I
guess that comment got ahead of me a
little bit, is that what I the most
predictable thing that's going to happen
is that the Democrat media is going to
say, "Well, we looked at the details of
this agreement and obviously this
agreement is not as good as Trump says
and it's not going to help in the real
world and things were going to go that
direction anyway." and he's saying it's
a big deal, but it's really no big deal.
So, the first few are going to get poo
pooed by the liberal media, the
anti-Trump media. You should expect
that. But they can't do it to all of
them. if if they just keep happening,
you know, if India comes online pretty
soon and, you know, maybe South Korea
and Japan, there's going to be a point
where it's unambiguously true that the
whole tariff thing
worked and then the media is going to
have to figure out something else to
talk about because they're going to be,
you know, over a hundred of them. you
know, the news will be almost every day,
well, we got another one and it's good
for America in three different ways. So,
and this will all happen before the
midterms. So, Trump may have pulled off,
it's way too early to say this, way too
early, but you can see the glimmer of
it. He may have pulled
off the greatest political economic move
of all time.
Way too early to say
that, but it's starting to signal in
that direction cuz, you know, all the
the chaos stuff seems to be dissipating
and now it's turning into, oh, there
must be serious people sitting around
the table making serious deals that are
actually good for
America. And that's exactly what's
happening.
So, I don't think
yet that the uh the media has accepted
the fact that Trump knows what he's
doing and that creating all that
ambiguity and what they call the chaos,
what somebody else would call
uncertainty caused the entire world to
want to make a deal really
fast. There's nothing else that could
have done that there. There's no amount
of begging, writing uh well-worded
memos, nothing. There's nothing else
that could have gotten all the major
trading partners to get on an airplane
and literally fly out here and say, "Can
we do this right away? Could we make a
better deal?" Only Trump could do that.
And and only the way he did it. Probably
there probably wasn't a second
way in all the world. There was probably
not any other way that this could have
been done.
And it's starting, it's too early to
say. Anything could go wrong, but it's
starting to look like he pulled off one
of the greatest moves I've ever
seen. Way too early to know that for
sure, but boy does it look like it.
We'll see.
Well, meanwhile, Jerome Powell at the
Fed is not uh looking to lower rates
anytime soon, and he's claiming it's
because of the uncertainty over the
tariffs and that the tariffs might um
cause
inflation, and he doesn't want to have
inflation and at the same time that he's
lowering uh interest rates. I don't
think he's making the right choice
because it feels political. Now, of
course, the Fed is supposed to be
famously
non-political, but I don't see how he
could be because Trump has been on his
ass so so hard. Uh, I feel
like I just don't trust him. I just
don't trust that his that his reasoning
is without political
bias. And that's a problem. Now, you
could say that maybe Trump is one that
caused the political bias, but I'm not
so sure because there there's an
anti-Trump sort of bias that's
everywhere all the time anyway. So, I
wonder if Trump had never said a thing
about, you know, to criticize the
Fed, would that make the Fed person more
mega? I don't think so. Would it make
the head of the Fed think um I can't go
and plague company if I help Trump with
my tax with my rate
cuts? I feel like the the social and
political pressure on the head of the
Fed would sort of cause them to want to
be
anti-Trump even if they weren't
naturally anti-Trump, you know, for
their own their own lifestyle.
But I would argue that all Trump needs
is for those rate cuts to happen before
the midterms. And there's plenty of time
for that. And I think that they will
because if the tariff negotiations go
well for the next 6 months and
especially if we get something happening
with uh China and all that needs to
happen with China is that we agree on a
pause uh while we work on a deal. That
could be enough. and a pause on tariffs
until we work on a deal. So, I feel like
Trump is setting up the
midterms really well that there should
be a rate
cut and there should be a whole bunch of
tariff deals done by
them. He's going to be hard to beat, you
know, or at least the Republicans are
going to be hard to beat.
Well, I was reading
Mario news summary, which I recommend by
the way. His news summaries are terrific
on X. Um, that Doge has uh put together
some software to make it easier to fire
government employees. So, you know how
everything is too complicated, but
apparently it was sort of complicated to
just fire anybody. So, they figured out
how to do a high-speed system for firing
federal workers. Now, apparently over
260,000 government employees are already
have already been let go because of
DOA's work. Did you know
that snuck up on me
260,000 have already been let
go? And then this will make it easier.
And apparently there's a whole bunch of
others who are targeted. So, we expect
the IRS to cut 40% of its staff and
maybe the VA to cut
80,000.
Um, and uh I guess the ultimate source
of this is
Reuters. Wow. Now, here's a story that
you've probably already heard. I think
I've mentioned it,
but I can't stop going back to it
because it's blowing my brain that
according to Scott Bessant in the
Treasury, over one-third of the payments
that were issued by the Treasury in the
in the recent past can't be tracked back
to the appropriations to find out if
they were if they were allowed in
appropriate expenses. Onethird
And keep in mind that all of the
government's expenses go through the
treasury and onethird did not have a
code on
them to say where the what it was about.
So you couldn't even judge whether they
were allowed or not. So now that's been
changed. And again, I'm going to say
that this might be DOA's biggest win.
Meaning that if if expenses in the
government suddenly and inexplicably go
down over the next year and a
half, isn't it going to look like all
the fraudsters knew that they would get
caught, so they stopped doing it?
Is it
possible that even if they couldn't
catch the fraud because the fraud was
hidden too well that if they they set up
a mechanism to catch it in the
future? Is it possible that we'll see
this gigantic drop in expenses then
nobody even understands? Like we don't
know why it went down.
If that
happens and some of it happens before
the
midterm, oh my
god. Now again, that I'm being super
optimistic, but I can't believe that a
third of the payments went without some
kind of a payment code and there wasn't
a great deal of fraud going on. It's
hard to
imagine there was anything else going
on. But also, Doge News libs of Tik Tok
is talking about this on X. Uh Doge
announced that they they ended 522
contracts worth $285 million in just the
last two days.
Now, h how do you terminate 522 contacts
contracts in the last two
days? I I have a
theory that they did it by the
title because it would be pretty hard to
really dig into all those contracts and
talk to all the, you know, all the
players, you know, the the buyers and
the sellers and to find out if it's
appropriate.
But but here's one that they canled. One
of the contracts included 181,000
uh USDA uh contract for and this is the
the title of what the contract is
technical climate advisor for central
Africa. Would would you feel that you
needed to do a deep dive before you cut
that? I wouldn't. I would just look at
the title. Do we need a technical
climate advisor for central Africa? No.
Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm going
to go with
no. So, it might be entirely possible
that you could you could get rid of 522
contracts just by reading the titles and
and figuring out how much you
laughed. I if if you laughed
uncontrollably at just the
title, that should be enough to cut it.
I'd be perfectly happy with that
standard. Why'd you cut it? We read the
title and we couldn't stop laughing.
Okay, good enough. That's all the
research I
need. Well, the center square is
reporting that uh there was a failed
vote to try to require voter ID in
Michigan.
Now I guess uh all the Republicans voted
to require voter ID and all the
Democrats voted no. So the thing failed.
It fell 16 votes shorts short. And my
question is this. This is genuine
curiosity. So that's that's going to
prevent me from getting Alzheimer's. My
curiosity. I'm actually curious about
this.
What do the normal Democrats think about
this? Because you know that, you know,
the far-left really the ones who are
really dug in, you know, they're going
to be in favor of any crazy thing that
as long as they can keep power. But if
you were just a normal
Democrat, not not an elected official
and not one of the crazy progressives,
just a normal Democrat. Let's take Bill
Maher.
Take Bill Maher for example, a normal
Democrat. What's he think about the fact
that a 100% of the Democrats don't want
voter
ID? Like how how do you possibly process
that other than
fraud and wanting to promote fraud?
Because there's no normal Democrat who
believes that black Americans can't get
an
ID. You know, we've literally never
found even one. So, do they just sort of
say to themselves, well, as long as it's
defeating the Nazis, it's
okay. And then how normal would you be
if you thought you were fighting Nazis?
It wouldn't be very normal at all. So,
does anybody know? I've never asked any
normal Democrat that question, but I
can't believe that a normal person, no
matter what side of the politics are on,
would a normal person think you
shouldn't have ID to vote in
America? I don't think so.
Right. Doesn't it seem to you that the
normal ones need to just sort of avoid
the question?
is good for their team. So, they
probably like, "Well, I'll worry about
other
things." So, I'd love to see the press
talk to normal
Republicans, you know, not elected ones,
and just say, "What do you think about
this? Did you know that your team voted
100% to not have good security for
elections?" What would they
say? Genuinely
curious. Here's some uh good news for
America. According to The Hill, uh Trump
signed an executive order on
apprenticeships. So, apprenticeships
um were already I guess we had quite a
bit of them, 680,000. He wants to get
that up to a million. But there's a
there was a bigger thing that was part
of the executive order which might be
helpful is that apparently our
um uh I guess our federal standards for
these
apprenticeships included a whole bunch
of fragmented federal workforce entities
doing their own thing. So it was a big
confused
um duplicative process. And so a big
part of the executive order is reducing
the duplication and simplifying the
whole how do you get an apprentice kind
of thing. Um so that's perfect. So they
want to identify work workforce
development and education programs that
are ineffective and get rid of those and
but just basically make the system work
for the first time or work better
really. at the same
time. Uh so so you could think of this
as more the the realization that college
isn't for everybody and that especially
if we have a more manufacturing coming
back to America, you're going to need
lots of people who can just do practical
things and you know they don't need to
read Shakespeare to do it. So I'm glad
the government sort of understands you
know the reality of the world that way.
However, it's even better. Uh
Google apparently has launched an
ambitious program, this is according to
Clean Technica,
uh to train 100,000 electrical workers
for the AI powered future. So, I assume
that means uh 100,000 electrical workers
to help them set up uh you more and more
data centers.
And they're also going to uh train
people uh they're looking to train
uh a whole bunch of people in
AI. So not not they're using AI to train
them but also training them in AI. So
Google is getting really aggressive in
training people that they're going to
use in their own workforce which again
requires no college. It just requires
the right directed um high quality
training and uh it aims to equip up up
to a million Americans with AI skills
separately from the electrical stuff. So
good for Google. So of course they're
doing it for their own company reasons.
They need this kind of workers and they
need a lot of them and uh they're going
to train
them. And then the third thing, these
are all related things, but they they
strongly suggest a theme or a pattern
that's going in the right direction. So
the postmillennials talking about this.
Apparently, US companies are looking to
recruit
workers in high
school, you know, almost like a sports
team is trying to recruit from college
usually. And the reason is that if they
wait
uh they won't get enough
employees. So between the Democrat, you
know, the demographic problem where
there are not enough young people being
born and now it probably be exacerbated
by the reduction in immigration. Uh,
apparently high schoolers who are 16 and
17 years old are being directly
contacted by major corporations in their
in their area to see if they can get
them interested in working in their
company as soon as they graduate. And
some of these these jobs pay over
$50,000 right out of high school. I
think it could be as high as 70,000 per
year for trade jobs.
And so imagine being 17 years old and
maybe you're not uh maybe you're not
heading for college and you've got these
companies trying to recruit you and
they're offering
you, you know, a good starting salary.
You still have to live at home on that
salary, I think, but uh that's pretty
impressive. So that's a good adjustment.
So I guess in at least three different
ways, the government, Google, and all
these uh smaller manufacturing
companies. And imagine how much of that
they're going to need when manufacturing
is, you know, really pulling back into
America.
Um, what this suggests to me is that
America is doing its America thing,
which is it's it's reading the future
and making the adjustments it needs to
make. And this is exactly the adjustment
that we need to make. And you're seeing
it in three different domains, which
suggests it's a now a universal,
understood, accepted thing. that we just
got to figure out how to get non-ol
students into the jobs that make sense
for the business as well as the
student. Anyway, uh apparently the US is
uh doing more spying on
Greenland as part of our effort to take
over their country. And I think it's
hilarious that it's not really secret.
So apparently the US says uh uh Trump
has ordered that the spy networks start
gathering more information about
Greenland. Specifically, they're looking
to find out who in Greenland might be in
favor of joining up with America and
which ones are not. Now you might say
and they they would use you know their
various spy apparatus for doing that
which would be electronic stuff that we
intercept and maybe we have some people
on the ground asking questions but we
wouldn't talk about that.
So it's kind of hilarious that we just
say out loud, "All right, Greenland. Uh
we're going to be doing a little spying
as step one to taking over your
country." And that's what we're doing.
Now, this would be step one of a color
revolution, wouldn't it? Now, the color
revolution has the, you know, the usual
steps. It's the thing we do to other
countries where the first thing we do is
figure out who would be on our side, you
know, who who we could work with and
then we fund them or help them become
heads of organizations and have a louder
voice in their own country. And then
maybe we pay for some uh protests on the
streets to make it look like, oh, the
public really wants this. It's a it's a
popular uprising. And then we might uh
see if we can control the media. So if
you turned on the television in
Greenland, it would say, you know,
people really want independence, meaning
joining America. Uh people really want
this. And so then the public would start
to think that there's this
gigantic, you know, natural organic
movement toward whatever the thing is,
but it's really just driven by us.
Um, now I don't know how far we would go
in this so-called color revolution, but
announce but the fact that it's
publicly it's public knowledge that
we're increasing our spy campaign to
figure out which of the locals are on
our
side. It's kind of hilarious. So, we
don't even try to hide
it. It's just fully
transparent.
Anyway, Tulsi Gabbard issued a
collection emphasis message to the
intelligence agencies to collect as much
information as possible. Now, I am again
I'm genuinely
curious what is the breakdown in the
actual public because I think it depends
how the question gets asked. I think
there's a way to ask the question where
the locals would say hell no and there's
probably a way to phrase the question
where the locals would say huh maybe or
even yes so you have to be careful how
you ask the question that's that's
all well the Wall Street Journal is
reporting that the fentinel question is
a key to the fact that the US and China
are going to be talking about trade
uh when some of the some of our
uh people are in Switzerland for other
reasons. Well, China was going to be in
Switzerland for other reasons and we
decided to meet them there to talk about
it. I think that happens this weekend.
Now the way it's being reported by the
Wall Street Journal is that China
started in using the fentinel opening as
a way to sort of get things moving
because we were stuck and they didn't
quite know how to unstick things but
they thought if they can just ask some
questions about fentinel and the
questions were what exactly do you want
us to do which is a good first question.
So, it I've been fascinated watching
China navigate the the dignity part of
this where Trump acted like a big bully
and then China quite reasonably
uh said you can't bully us. So, this
can't look like bullying or it's going
nowhere. But how do you get out of that?
How do you get out of that frame? Well,
you have people meet in Switzerland
instead of the US or China. That's a
good start because it, you know, seems
like, all right, well, that's, you know,
it's just Switzerland and it it just
doesn't seem like it's a direct thing.
And then you have them asking, well,
what would you like us to do about
fentinel? As if it's just a separate,
unrelated, perfectly reasonable
question, which it is.
And uh apparently the US answer is that
uh among other things they want China to
send the message out to the the makers
of the uh fentinel precursors that the
penalties will be
severe. Now I don't know if that's ever
going to happen because I don't think
China is actually serious about stopping
the flow of fentinol. I don't think
they're serious at all. But if at least
gets us to talk about the other trade
stuff, you know, maybe it served some
weird purpose
there. Maybe. But meanwhile, um the big
question is whose economy is going to
blink first? Is the US going to have
more problems because of these tariffs
or is China? And the one thing I can
tell you about uh the Chinese
economy, I don't believe any story about
the Chinese
economy. I I feel like you could read a
story that says um from somebody who
seems to be an expert that China is
ready to collapse any moment now and
they'll give pretty good reasons. Well,
you got this bubble and you got this
demographic problem and you know, you
got all these factories that are closing
and the workers are not getting paid and
and it sounds pretty good. And you say
to yourself, all right, all right, looks
like China can't hang. So, they're going
to have to make a deal. And
then five years later, China will still
be there cooking
along. And I don't feel anybody knows
anything about China. And of course, we
can't believe any numbers that come out
of it. So, you have to be careful. Um,
but here's something that uh Zero Hedge
was saying. Uh, according to Zero Hedge,
the last cargo ships from China arriving
in US ports that won't have a tariff.
So, apparently, if you were already at
sea and you were shipping stuff to the
US, that would not be covered by the
extra high Trump tariffs.
So those are just coming into the docks
now. So if you bought anything after
that, it might be, you know, part of
shortages or whatever. So if some of
those shortages really
hurt, it's going to cost China more than
they know. meaning that it's one thing
if I can't get 30
dolls, but one of the one of the things
we might not be able to get is
ibuprofen because apparently it's you
most of the
ibuprofen there there would be other
pharma products that might be a problem
too. But if I don't get
ibuprofen, which is the only thing
keeping me alive right
now, I'm really going to be
mad. So, China has to
manage not just the products and the
tariffs and the economy. I mean, it's a
lot to manage, but they have to manage
how we feel about it. And there going to
be some products that if they hold back
on them or or somehow they're delayed, I
don't know if Trump is going to get the
blame for
that. I think we're going to blame
China. Um, but there was a there was a
data that again, you have to be careful
about believing any data about the
Chinese economy, but here's what Zero
Hedge said. Um, and this surprised me
that since
2018, US imports from China have dropped
from 20 21% of total goods to
13%. Did you know
that? That uh in 2018 21% of our total
goods came from China, but that's
dropped all the way to 13%.
What was it that happened in
2018 that would have
changed that number so drastically
starting in
2018? Does anybody know? So, this is a
question for my regular viewers, people
who have been with me since
2018. Does anybody know what happened in
2018 that could have been the start of
something really bad for the Chinese
economy?
I'm not going to answer that question,
but the people who follow me on
Locals, they know what I'm talking
about.
Um, and you never know. Hey, you know,
maybe we live in a big old
simulation and maybe things that uh you
didn't think were connected, maybe
they're more connected than you
thought. You never know.
All right. Um, apparently Nvidia shares
are expected to go up because uh, Trump
administration is going to end some chip
export restrictions. I guess the
restrictions were developed by the Biden
administration, but they were supposed
to go into effect on the 15th of this
month, and they were sort of complicated
and stupid. So, the Trump administration
is looking to simplify them, which would
be good for
Nvidia. Um, and CNBC is reporting on
that. So, it's not a change in the
tariffs or anything. It's it's simply
has more to do with America deciding
which of our technologies we should
allow other countries to have access to.
And, uh, Trump is just going to simplify
that. So, that's good news.
All right, this is really funny. This is
a story on
Twitchy. Um, even Pete Buddha
Judge is saying that it was too hard to
build things in America because of
excessive
regulations. Now, do you think the
excessive
regulations came from
Republicans? Do you think he's
complaining about all the Republicanled
excessive regulations?
Well, I'm going to read to you some of
the uh wording of the regulations that
made it hard for a Buddha judge to build
any infrastructure because, as you know,
he completely failed in building any
infrastructure.
[Music]
So, this is going to sound like a like a
joke. It'll sound like standup comedy,
but I swear this is the real the real
language from the government.
So, um, apparently,
uh, shortly after Biden took office, he
signed an executive order, uh, mandating
that the
beneficiaries of 40% of all federal
climate and environmental programs
should come from underserved
communities.
If they said nothing else, that would
have stopped all
progress because it would be nothing but
fighting over who the un under un under
underserved communities are you know
since it's
vague all the people who said I'm
underserved. No, I'm
underserved. So, you know, that would
have killed progress right there. But it
gets
better. Uh the order. So again, this was
Biden established the White House
environmental justice environmental
justice advisory council which monitors
agencies such as the Department of
Transportation and uh it was to ensure
this is quote that voices, perspective
and lived realities of communities with
environmental justice concerns are heard
in the White House and reflected in
federal policies, investments,
decisions.
So, how would you like to be a company
that builds stuff and you run into that
buzz
saw? Uh, boss, did you know about this?
What? Hey, what? We're applying for that
big grant so we can build that thing
that they want to be built. Yeah. Yeah.
And we know how to build things and
we'll had the money to do it. So, we're
good to go, right? Well, well, but only
if we hear the voices, perspectives and
lived realities of the communities with
environmental justice concerns uh that
are reflected in federal policies,
investments, and decisions. and that in
order to qualify for the grant, the
applicants must quote demonstrate how
meaningful public involvement inclusive
of disadvantaged communities will occur
throughout a project's life cycle. So,
so you can't even like do a big thing in
the
beginning. Uh it's it's better for you
to uh make sure that it's spread out
over the life cycle of the
project. And apparently the the phrases
like public involvement are all unclear,
so you don't know if you've got enough,
but it should involve quote intentional
outreach to underserved communities. So,
who gets to decide if it's if there's
enough and if you were intentional
enough? But
wait, I'm not even to the good stuff
yet. You ready for this? According to
the Department of uh Transportation, the
outreach to these underserved
communities can take the form of, and I
swear to God I'm not making this up. I'm
not making this up. The outreach to
these communities could take the forms
of games and contests, visual preference
surveys, or neighborhood block parties.
so long as the grant recipient provides
quote multilingual staff or interpreters
to interact with community members who
use languages other than
English. So, do you have any questions
about why the the Biden administration
didn't get anything
built? the the the incompetence that's
layered in
this goes beyond just oh my god it's
bad. It's actually just
funny to read their actual words. You
know, anybody who's been in any kind of
a real business, you know, you could
never satisfy these
requirements because as long as they're
vague, it allows everybody who says
they're in an underserved situation to
say, "You haven't done enough for me."
So no matter how much you're going to
do, somebody's going to say, "You didn't
do enough for
me." All
right. Um I guess President Xi is
meeting with Putin. I think it's that's
today. I saw the video. I think it was
today. Maybe it was yesterday.
Um and uh he's there because
the you know there's the big uh victory
day parade that's happening that uh
Putin is putting on and I didn't
realize that Putin has connected
everything from Hitler to the Ukraine
war and has always framed it. I guess I
knew this but somehow you forget about
it.
Um, you forget that uh Putin has always
said that what he was doing in Ukraine
was getting rid of the
Nazis. And and then I look at the United
States and, you know, the Democrats want
to get rid of the Nazis, too. Like,
we're still fighting the Nazis.
And Putin apparently is making that work
cuz he he's selling that version that
he's just denazifying the world and he's
trying to get President Xi to help I
guess. So she will join the uh
celebration of getting rid of the
Nazis according to them.
Well, as you know, India and Pakistan um
are
lobbing uh weapons in each other,
artillery in one direction and missiles
and drones in the other direction. But
you heard there there was an enormous
dog fight. Did you hear that news? So
both Pakistan and India had uh a large
number of jets in the air who were
directly fighting each other and they
called it a dog
fight. And then later we find out
uh later we find out that they stayed on
their own side of the
border. So none of the Indian jets went
into Pakistan and none of the Pakistani
jets went into
India but they had an enormous multi-our
dog
fight.
So does that raise any questions with
you? like what the hell kind of a dog
fight is it if you're not even in the
same country at the same time and the
answer is they were shooting things from
I don't know over a 100 miles away so it
was all long range
attacks so I guess the Indian jets were
just sort of circling on their side of
the border and the Pakistanis were on
their side of the border and not even
close they were you know hundreds of
miles away and uh somebody launch a
missile and sometimes it would hit and
sometimes it wouldn't, I
guess. So, that was a dog fight. But it
does
suggest that um they're very they're
both very serious about not
escalating. So, that's the good news. I
don't think you would I don't think you
would spend that much energy making sure
you never cross the border with your
jet. You know, at the time when you're
you're basically at war and still you're
not going to cross the border, that's
pretty serious indication that you don't
want to escalate. You just want to make
sure you've made your point that you
can't mess with us. And I guess they
both made the point that you can't mess
with us or there will be problems.
So that's where that went. All right,
ladies and gentlemen, that's all I've
got for today. Thanks for joining if
you're on YouTube or Rumble or X. I'm
going to talk to the people on Locals
platform privately now in about 30
seconds. And uh the rest of you, thanks
for joining. Hope you come back
tomorrow, same time, same place. All the
good news that's happening.
