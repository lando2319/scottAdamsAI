[Music]
hey everybody
don't go away looking for something that
you're going to like
maybe maybe
it goes like this
that's right it's my theme song
i've got a theme song and i also uh
i always wanted to have some something
like a co-host
but if you have a co-host then you've
got to worry about
coordinating with them and are they
talking when you want to talk
and all those things so instead of
having a co-host
i just recorded myself complimenting
myself
that is brilliant
so that's my co-host and of course if i
say something that's hilarious
normally the co-host would do the uh the
fake laugh
but i just recorded my own fake laugh
so imagine i say something funny and
then
[Laughter]
see so you don't need an actual person
i've replaced another human with a robot
now i know why you're here and i know
you want to have the simultaneous sip
before we get to the good stuff and all
you need is
a copper bugger a glass of tanker
chelsea's steiner can't eat jugger flask
a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the dopamine hit of
the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and you can enjoy it now go
[Music]
i don't know about you but i feel that
my mouth is becoming like an
n95 mask just from having the
simultaneous step
yeah i am i am that protected from the
coronavirus
so here's an interesting thing uh reddit
or somebody on reddit did a split screen
of
kamala harris so you can see her before
and after her
face looked different for reasons that
we don't have any confirmation for
but i have alleged based on my expert
advisors that kamala probably had some
cosmetic surgery not probably i'd say
something in the 100 range of
probability
i had some cosmetic surgery and but what
was interesting is
the reddit did a split screen where they
took the
left part of her face from you know a
few weeks ago
and then they put the right side of her
face as it looked in that interview next
to it and man it does not look like the
same person
it really doesn't look like the same
person so people were speculating on
reddit because it's read it
that maybe it was a deep fake maybe it's
the first time
you've seen a digital reproduction of a
politician and it wasn't actually her
is that possible
no no it's not it's not possible
um let me say this it's possible
technically
technically they could have done a
digital
uh deep fake of camellaris that would
look a lot more like her
prior self than the one that was
actually on camera
which didn't look like her at all
because she's still a bit swollen i
think from the surgery
it may have some nerves that need to you
know reconstruct themselves over time
so here's my take the reason that we
eliminate the option that it was a deep
fake
what's the one reason that you know it
wasn't a deep fake
because it wasn't good enough right if
you did a deep fake
it would look a whole lot like the real
person
but but because of the surgery she
didn't look even close
to what she used to look like so you
wouldn't do a deep fake
that poorly so you can rule out deep
fake as one of the options
somebody said that it was a body double
you can't rule that one out
yeah you want to rule out body double
because it's ridiculous
but i can't rule that one out
i happen to think it's a very low chance
it's that
and like i said 100 chance really that
it was just
recovering from surgery and like i said
uh i'm definitely not
if any of this sounds like i'm making
fun of her
or that i'm mocking her for that i'm not
because i'm completely in favor of
cosmetic surgery but there are good ones
that are bad ones and there are ways to
handle it and there
are ways not to handle it and if i were
her i would not have gone on camera that
soon
but she did and
if everything heals up the way it should
she's probably going to look
great relative to how she looked before
and she'll come back ahead possible
but i think that the fact that she had
the surgery this close to the
nomination process sort of suggests
maybe she's not the one they picked
because i just
can't see her doing that interview with
her
post cosmetic surgery face
i assume just an assumption
i can't see that her advisors would have
let her do that
unless they just didn't know how to say
to her um
kamala give it a few weeks you don't
look quite right yet
but they should have so it's making me
wonder if she's still the number one
choice for biden
because this would argue against it
um but we'll see here's a question i
have for you
how close are we as a country to having
widely available
and widely available is important
because it's not widely available it
doesn't count
instant test results for covet 19.
i know i've heard of at least one
startup
that was trying to get that done fairly
quickly and thought they were close to
it
but you know that was over a month ago
so
i don't know where that's at so here's
the question
how can we get to the other side of this
without either
vaccines or the ability to get a test
result right away
so you don't go out and reinfect the
public for six days while you're waiting
for a test
um
don't say vaccines never so some of you
think the vaccines will never
happen and i don't disagree with that
i would say i am curious why this one
would have
a widely effective vaccine when that's
not something we've had in the past
maybe because we're trying harder i
don't know
but i've got a real question on that and
there's no reporting that i know of
showing startups who are close to having
some kind of instant
test results now that's different from
a quick test the test itself is quick
getting
the results is what makes you wait
how interesting is it that the united
states has
put now some sanctions on some chinese
elites in the communist party for their
uh abuse of the uyghur muslim
minority in china
why is it that the
the people who ate trump the most well i
guess i'm answering my own question
but they don't seem to focus on the fact
that the united
states is actively in that great risk
trying to put pressure on china to treat
their muslim minority better
that feels like a counter narrative to
everything that people think about trump
but why doesn't anybody really talk
about that it's just so
obviously opposed to everything that
people say about trump
what do people say about trump he'll get
a he wants a chinese deal
for his own personal political reasons
no matter what
right so that's what they say and they
also say he's a big old racist
who hates muslims but what we're
watching in the news
literally today the news is that he's
screwing the chinese elites
and putting pressure on them because
they're abusing their muslim minority
it's exactly opposite of everything that
the left thinks about him
but you don't see it reported that way
it's just sort of reported factually
you don't see it reported in terms of it
being counter to the narrative
which is the way i would expect it to be
reported
so if you missed the uh kanye
or shall we call him yay uh
drama last night uh i tell ya
these social media tools are amazing
because
kanye was having some personal problems
literally with his his family and
he was tweeting it in real time and he
was he was sending like a tweet a minute
there for a while and you'd see it you
know
five minutes ago four minutes ago three
minutes ago and a fresh woman would come
in
so as it was happening the tweets were
appearing
and it was just sort of amazing that you
could
look into his life through his eyes
as it was happening and i guess what the
problem was is that
allegedly
[Music]
kim kardashian was upset about something
he said about the children
or his behavior in general it's not
clear
and may or may not have this is the
accusation
have tried to bring a doctor out to
wyoming to
bring kanye i don't know
to get him away from this or whatever
and
it is just so fascinating to watch now
can kanye become president i would say
no
after yesterday it looks like a big no
um i wouldn't have said that even two
days ago actually
two days ago i would have said well it's
a wild long shot
but i wouldn't rule him out because look
at the other things he's done
there were also long shots so if you're
if you're ruling kanye out of
anything because it's a long shot
you have to look at the context of his
whole life
long shots is what he does sort of the
other thing he does consistently
so i wouldn't have ruled him out until
this episode because i think this
episode
uh reveals that there's some turmoil
that would be you know certainly worth
considering
uh when you're trying to figure out do
you do
do you want a president who can keep the
country calm
or do you need a or do you want a
president who needs the country to keep
him calm
so i feel like he took himself out of
contention yesterday
with this however
how many times have we been surprised
how many times
have we been surprised that something we
thought couldn't happen happened
so i guess you could never rule
kanye out but he does have an album
that's dropping
and i don't think i've ever seen anybody
promote an album better than him
he is the best album promoter of all
time
the fact that he's doing this just when
his album comes out
yeah as somebody's reminding me in the
car in the comments
that even in his tweets there
there's a level of creativity because he
said that uh you know he calls himself
and so uh he said that kim tried to
bring a kamye
c-a-l-m-y-e
kamye to to calm him down instead of a
kanye
so i thought that was pretty funny
anyway
so we watch with interest and i think uh
i think most of you would join me in
wishing that kanye and his family do
well uh
it looks like they've got some they've
got some
challenges there but i hope that works
out
um so a week ago
i was being ridiculed by the press
ridiculed i say
nothing new for me of course being
ridiculed by the press is sort of my
daily
situation but uh last week there
the the stories and the tweets
sounded like this dilbert cartoonist
ridiculously claims that republicans
will be hunted if biden is elected
ridiculous what a nut job republicans
being hunted come on
scott you dilbert cartoonist crazy guy
a little bit of hyperbole don't you
think kind of crazy
that was last week this week the new
york times is trying to kill tucker
carlson's family
so a lot can change in a week
if you're not watching that story so as
you know
antifa found tucker carlson's prior home
just a year ago or whatever it was and
they protested
while his wife was inside his family and
scared them
uh quite deeply to the point where they
moved
so tucker carlson actually moved because
they found out where his house is
and now he is revealed and we have to
wait to see
the details of this but he's probably
right about this
that the new york times is preparing a
story
which will reveal where his new home is
now what will happen to tucker carlson's
family
if the new york times does as tucker
alleges
reveals where he lives now they might
not do it with an address they might do
it in
some somewhat indirect way that still
gets you the same place
but if this happens
what would be the news value of of
doxing
tucker carlson and his family and may i
remind you that his family doesn't have
anything to do with any of this
they are not actively participants
in anything that anybody is mad at
tucker carlson about
and you know you wonder where the line
is
right at what point does a line get
crossed and boy this seems like a line
getting crossed
wow does this seem like a line getting
crossed
now we don't know yet if they'll cross
it because i think the stakes are very
high for the new york times
uh certainly for the new york times this
could be an extinction
event and by by that i mean you could
imagine the new york times going out of
business
right i mean things have changed
amazingly quickly in the last few months
such that it's now easy to imagine
almost anything happening in two weeks
because things are just changing so
quickly so could the new york times
actually be going out of business
i think if they dox tucker carlson
that that would light a fuse which would
make that very likely
i don't want to i don't want to suggest
what kinds of things might come out of
this
but let's just say that if tucker
carlson's
family is targeted by the new york times
that will change everything that's not
that's not games anymore that would
change everything
and again i don't want to put into words
anything that sounds
threatening but i don't need to
right i kind of don't need to
half of the country would have exactly
the same opinion
should this happen so i think it's good
that the right
has put down a marker
i will simply uh read to you
what rasmussen quoted so rasmussen of
rasmussen polls their their twitter
account
tweeted this to that story in raw
national reach and ability to deliver
impressions
fox news could if they chose to
retaliate talking about the new york
times retaliate in an overwhelming
fashion against every single new york
times doxor
including its publisher and perhaps the
time for that has arrived
oh my god it's the new york times move
next move so rasmussen
just put it out there i mean they just
laid it out there
that if this line is crossed
you should reasonably expect
an aggressive response now what
an aggressive response looks like and
who is doing
the responding unknown
unknown but it would be a very
aggressive response
um and again i i so
want to describe what that might look
like but i'm not going to because i
don't want to
i don't want to be whipping up a frenzy
when we haven't seen yet what the new
york times is actually going to do
but if they actually dox tucker
carlson's family
there will be an aggressive response
what can we all agree on that would you
all agree that there will be
an aggressive response it will not be
words
let me say that as clearly as possible
the response will not be limited to
words i'm not saying
that i'm doing anything personally so
i'm not making any kind of a threat
personally i'm just predicting that this
is a line
if they cross this line they have to do
it knowingly
do it with your eyes open it could be an
extinction event for the new york times
because this is just a line
you can't ignore this line it's not
something that
society can ignore um is it fair to call
the press the enemy of the people
well look at this story
look what they did to scott alexander
who was just minding his own business
and they doxed him
pretty much could have ruined his career
for no reason
there was no you can actually hear my
dog snoring yeah
that's snickers story uh
anyway at the same time we see that the
mccloskeys
the pair who were guarding their
expensive home with their handgun
and rifle apparently they've been
charged a number of charges
what so they've actually been charged
now i'm not a lawyer so i won't weigh in
on whether the charges are reasonable or
likely to be successful
if i had to guess i would say there's no
chance that they'll be successful
and if they were successful i would if i
were the mccloskeys i would want to
hurry up this trial
to get some kind of a presidential
pardon
working because if there were if anybody
was ever going to get a presidential
pardon
it's the mccloskeys all right honestly
if the mccloskeys got
prosecuted and trump did not pardon them
and by the way is
kenny pardon them is that federal
charges
or is his state if his state he can't do
it right
so actually i guess i'd have to look
into that um
did you hear the story about there was a
judge who was
assigned to this epstein related
deutsche bank
case so she was just assigned to the
case
and then some guy dressed as a
fedex deliverer comes to their house and
shoots her husband and son
the husband will survive the sun did not
she was downstairs so she didn't get
shot now uh
of course you might ask yourself what
are the odds that someone who was
just assigned a case epstein
related would get shot and then the guy
who did the shooting
is also dead i think is suicide
um so when you first read that you say
well here we go again
you know galen maxwell is going to be
killed in jail
and and all that um however
once you find out more about the shooter
it turns out that he just had a history
of
anti-women problems and he had a problem
with this judge it sounds like and
so it probably had nothing to do with
epstein just a coincidence
that's what it looks like
so the president um apparently taking a
cue
from pundits etc
decided to photograph himself and tweet
a photograph of himself wearing his mask
and he said this we are united in our
effort to defeat the invisible china
virus
and many people say that it is patriotic
many people say that is patriotic
to wear a face mask when you can't
socially distance
there is nobody more patriotic than me
your favorite president
and then there's a picture of him with
his face mask and i'll say it again
he looks good in a face mask yeah you i
don't think you could say that about
everybody but the president actually
looks good in a face mask it matches his
suit
it just uh if he was worried about it
looking silly
i think that that would be um
that would be a worry that you shouldn't
worry about because it doesn't look
silly at all it looks
it looks it looks good it actually looks
good there's no other word for it
so how much is the president just
responding to public public opinion
because there was a lot of public
opinion that he should be more
more assertive in recommending face
masks i don't think this was
much of a step in that direction but
it's at least making clear
that he's pro face mask so that clarity
may be useful and at least now nobody
can say hey mr president
if you had not if you had not
acted the way you were then maybe your
followers and your supporters would be
more likely to wear masks
i think this might go a long way to
taking that away
but or at least the complaint away
i don't know if it'll go a long way to
making people wear masks
but it could be politically smart
apparently trump is considering holding
coronavirus updates a few times a week
but without the coronavirus task force
now i don't know if that's real news or
fake news
doesn't that sound like fake news that
the president's going to hold
coronavirus updates but the
task force members won't be invited that
doesn't even sound real
because what would be if you wanted um
yeah if you i'm reading your tweet and
i'm
i'm smiling at your at your comment you
know who you are
um
if uh if you were going to advise
president trump
to lose the election what would that
look like
let's say you were really a mole and you
were advising the president
but you were secretly advising him in a
way that he would lose the election
so you're not really trying to help
you're trying to trick him into doing
something that's bad for him
what would that look like well if it
were me
and i wanted the president to lose the
election i would ask him to hold
coronavirus
updates a few times a week and don't
invite the experts
i can't see i can't see any possibility
that this could go well for him so i
don't know what's going on
i think he may be responding to the fact
that he's being criticized for not
having
leadership around the coronavirus
now if he were really disciplined
he could pull this off but does he think
that he is that disciplined does
president trump believe of himself that
he could be so disciplined that he would
not
just opine about medical things and
maybe make some over claims about the
virus wearing itself out etc
would he be disciplined enough to do
that
does he think that of himself we don't
know
but i got to tell you there's nothing
about this that looks right
like it's a good idea but on the other
hand he almost has to get out there
because if it if he's just sort of
silent and
hanging back while the country is
falling apart with coronavirus
that will not look like leadership so he
has to do something
but it looks like he's been tricked into
doing the very worst thing
which is him riffing about coronavirus
without his experts if i were to put in
the suggestion
maybe kaylee mciney
if you wanted to do uh additional
uh additional let's say leadership stuff
around coronavirus
it might be tempting to say kaylee mcani
will do those
because she is disciplined if you want
to pick somebody who's not going to
you know leave message and who's going
to make a dent
and who's going to get the headlines
that you want to get
it would be her so she's the strongest
communicator on the
on the team but but of course the
president needs to show leadership
himself
so what's that look like because i it
doesn't make sense for
kaylee and the president to be at the
same event because she is his
you know his uh replacement substitute
if you will when he's not talking
so i don't know how they're going to
pull this off i think it can be done
i think it's just really dangerous
but it can be done and maybe it needs to
be it might be that it's just absolutely
necessary
now if i were to advise the president
which uh i guess you could say everybody
in social media is advising the
president because he does watch it
the the president does and his staff
they do monitor social media which they
should right
to find out what messages work and what
matches messages don't work
so and get the mood of the room so of
course they're watching
so in in the sense that all of us are
advising the president
let me let me do mine i would say that
if he were if he stuck to a very
limited palette of messages he could do
a good job so in other words if he came
out and said what he said in the tweet
look i know you guys have a different
opinion difference of opinion about
masks
but i think it is patriotic to at least
consider your fellow humans consider the
whole
and i would ask you to consider it a
patriotic
thing to wear the mask when you can't
social distance
now should he say that i think he could
get away with that but again it would
have to be clean
and and stick to just the stuff we know
if he wanders into the science of masks
big mistake if he wanders into the
science of
the therapies big mistake
but i think it would also be very useful
for him to present
the argument that the economy is
life and death and he hasn't made that
case as well
as he could and if he reinforced that
week after week
between now and election day while we're
trying to open up but we know there will
be deaths
there's no there's no way around it
there will be deaths if he made his case
for the economy equals life and death
that's worth making because i don't
think that's been made strongly enough
so there are some opportunities he could
make this work
but man it's a risky proposition but
when was the last time he
when was the last time trump ran away
from a risky proposition
in terms of him appearing somewhere
i don't know i don't think he does and
he probably at this point he has
to do this
did you hear that the major league
baseball
is going to have an app that lets the
fans who are at home
cheer into their phone or their mobile
device
and the amount of cheering that they're
doing at home
will be translated into some kind of
software
at the event the live baseball game and
then the
the speakers at the live baseball game
will
i believe what they will do is they'll
reproduce um
artificial cheering but it will be
gauged
to match what is actually happening at
home so you won't hear the voices of the
people
at home you know if you're the player
you're not going to hear any individual
voices at home
you can hear cheering but it will be
gauged
to be the same level and timing as the
people cheering at home
it's pretty good it's pretty good now
you remember at the very beginning of
the
uh of the shutdown that that was exactly
what i suggested although i think they
improved it because what i suggested
is that you actually hear the people at
home you just sum it up into
one thing but i think the way they're
doing it probably makes more sense
you know just technically and it'll end
up about the same
so good good for them um and look how
quickly this happened
in just a few months an app was built
the entire
idea of outdoor
outdoor entertainment at a big event
have changed i mean this is pretty
impressive timing if they get that to
work
um let's see
you know have you seen any photos of
downtown portland
you know the the media's at least the
mainstream media is largely blocking out
the stories of this because all trump
would have to do to get elected
is just show portland like you could
just stop
everything you know the president could
say you know what
you know normally i'm not recommending
this but just to make a point
the the president could say you know
normally i talk about lots of different
things
you know the economy and dealing with
china and everything but this election
is much
simpler it's me versus portland
portland is what you get if you elect
biden
that's what you get and then show lots
of pictures of portland
being basically closed down and and full
of graffiti
and say that's that's your choice
and you don't even have to talk about
anything else you don't have to talk
about taxes
i mean you could just say look at these
pictures this is what you're voting for
you are guaranteed to get this and a lot
more of it
i i'll promise you that i'll work
against this
that'd probably be enough um
let's see before i get myself canceled
because i've got a cancellation topic
coming up here
i get closer and closer to the rim all
right
there's a article by the or at least a
tweet by the mayo clinic health systems
now it's the mayo clinic so there are
some
trusted medical experts right
so this is from the mayo clinic and they
say that the
n95 masks are not as safe as
you might think because the air is
filtered as
it's coming into the mask that's what
they do they filter the air coming in
but the person who's wearing the mask
when they exhale
there's a valve built into it that just
lets the
exhaling out the valve so
mayo clinic is reminding people that
that's the case or telling them
and saying that that is unfiltered air
coming out of the mouth
so if that person who's wearing the mask
is infected
their unfiltered breath is going through
the valve and therefore
not as safe as you think so that's
pretty good information right
aren't you glad that they gave you that
information because you feel smarter now
safer far more informed now you really
understand what to do about the masks
no no it's the mayo
i don't want to swear but i think i'll
try to hold off
it's the mayo clinic so here's what they
should have said
yes it's true that the n95 desks are
primarily for health care professionals
and primarily to filter things that are
coming into the healthcare professional
that part we all agree on let's talk
about the exhaling
the exhaling we also agree there's a
valve
involved so when you're inhaling the
valve is closed but when you exhale it
opens and lets the unfiltered air out of
the mask
but here's the question that the mayo
the mayo clinic doesn't answer
it's the one that matters so the
question that matters the most
by far there's one big question that
matters
and they don't mention it they don't
mention it
and here's what matters that unfiltered
air that goes through that little valve
where does it go because i've looked at
the valve
and to me it looks like there's a valve
and then there's a barrier
and then the air would come out from
around the barrier so in other words it
doesn't go straight out the valve
and shoot at the person you're talking
to it goes to the left and the right
and up and down isn't that exactly why
you're wearing
a non n95 mask you're not trying to
filter out all of the virus
because stuff's coming out the side if
it's a regular mask right
you're trying to just keep it local the
whole point
of the person who may or may not have
coronavirus and not know about it
is to keep that person and their viruses
local to them and not project it as far
as it might project
so the n95 would probably do that
if it doesn't do that because this is
some kind of a miracle valve
which projects things out even though
there's a barrier there a plastic
barrier
which should project it i think i think
it projects it down but i'm not positive
about that
so leaving out where does the air go and
is it important if it stays near the
person who exhaled it
is just criminally criminally
bad information i mean this is just
so bad that this is actually in the news
and why does a cartoonist have to
explain that to you
because and by the way nobody's
disagreeing with what i said right
i don't believe there's anybody
disagreeing that that little valve
does change the direction of the
of the exhaled air and if it doesn't
change it in a positive way well they
should tell us that
they should tell us that if it does
change it by keeping it closer to your
body
they should tell us that why because
it's the most important question
left out of the whole story boy it's
hard not to swear when i
say stuff like this it's just hard
all right meanwhile over at uh let's get
me let's get me canceled
i don't think i've done enough to cancel
myself yet
so let's see if i can get that done so
over at
fox news they've got some drama there
are two separate women who are accusing
four at least four male uh
celebrities uh over at
fox news now you have to separate the
two accusers because they're they're
very different situations
uh one of the accusers has accused i
think
four different people including ed henry
hannity tucker carlson and
howard kurtz now
if you look at the nature of the
accusations
you'll say to yourself well i guess all
women have to be
trusted all women have to be believed
except that you look at the accusations
and they just don't look
believable
i do believe and it sounds completely
believable
that if you create a situation with rich
male alpha good-looking guys
and then you populate it with attractive
younger women who dress in a certain way
with tight skirts
and heels you are guaranteed problems
so if you know independent of these
accusations which actually sound
pretty pretty thin pretty pretty thin
uh well let me just come around and say
i doubt them
we don't know but the accusations from
one of the women
look completely not credible the one who
accused all four of them of bad behavior
so i don't know where that will go but
fox news looked into it and said nope
there's nothing here
and apparently they looked into it
pretty hard and found nothing there
but people are people and you you have
to assume that there's a little bit of
flirtatiousness that you can't get out
of the system
i mean you maybe you'd like it to get
out of the system
but if you create a situation with that
many young
good-looking healthy people
it's pretty hard to get rid of all the
bad behavior
then there's the other one so the other
one has accused i believe
only ed henry of rape
but when you read the accusation
it really doesn't sound that way
now i get it i get it believe all women
you have to treat all these things
seriously
and and so we shall so we'll treat it
seriously
because it has to be treated seriously
but i can tell you my opinion
right because there will be a jury
involved and
you know presumably there'll be some you
know probable cause
involved etc and if i were on the jury
and i heard this story the way it's been
reported
i would just shake my head and vote not
guilty
now of course there'll be lots more
evidence coming out
but let me give you just one report
from it so there are at least two or
three occasions
where the accuser willingly went and had
drinks with ed henry
and willingly went to his hotel room
according to her those things she did
willingly now willingly of course gets
into what about the power difference
you know is is there really any such
thing as willing
when there's a power differential those
those are good questions
i won't deal with that right now but um
in one specific part of the allegations
they say they went back to
his room and they he quote or ripped her
clothes off
now when you hear that phrase ripped her
clothes off
what does that sound like to you does it
sound like it actually ripped
in other words does she have a blouse
that's
sort of ripped does she have any ripped
clothes because if if your accusation
could be described with normal words
such as you know we undressed or
something like that
um you have to ask yourself if they just
put in uh provocative words where if you
had gotten rid of the provocative words
it wouldn't sound like anything
yeah the way it's written um
so i would say that neither of these
accusations
appear credible on the surface
with the exception of if the argument
has to do with the
power imbalance and the assumptions made
by the
by the the young woman that i would say
that's
that's different than rape very
different
now that would be a question that would
be appropriate for your employer
if your employer felt that the
power imbalance was creating this
bad situation and that you have to fire
the person who's
maybe taking advantage of the power
imbalance that's employer employees
employee situation
i don't know that that's illegal is it
where
where where is the line at which you can
say okay now that's a crime
i don't know where that line is actually
if it's just if you're talking about the
internal thoughts of people and they're
internally thinking that there's
pressure but nobody's actually
said it and there's actually some
attraction between the two people
where's
where do you draw that line i don't know
where that is i have no idea
yeah so the the question is whether
consent
is real in the case where there's a
power imbalance
or is consent um
always coercion just by the nature of
the situation
well that's a different question but i
would note
that i don't believe ed henry's accuser
is making that kind of accusation uh
there's some hint of it but it looks
like the accusation
is really about forceful rape
and i would say that the way the story
is told
suggests that's not the case
now if later somebody tries to cancel me
by saying scott said it didn't happen he
doesn't believe women
that didn't just happen right you did
not witness me saying
that that i know what happened because i
don't know what happened
you don't know what happened i'm not
even sure ed henry knows what happened
and i mean that don't you think that ed
henry is sitting home thinking something
like this
you know it didn't feel like that was
happening when i was there
like i i mean i was there there was no
better witness than me
i was in the room every single time
and it didn't feel like any of these
things to me
i feel like that's probably what's
happening i think he's probably saying
so he says scott do you believe biden
i would say that the biden accusation is
similarly sketchy meaning that
if you were to just look at it on its
surface you'd probably say
that doesn't sound like something that
happened
so yes i would i would treat them
similarly now i will say
that when tara reid appeared
on interviews she looked completely
convincing
meaning that you can have a situation
where the accuser is completely credible
and tara reid is now we haven't seen
these two accusers talk in public yet
it's completely possible if not probable
that if you heard them you would say
okay that sounds pretty credible
maybe i don't know so the terror reads
situation is different because if you
only heard the accusation you'd say
that doesn't sound real but if you hear
her talking about it
she does sound credible which doesn't
mean it's true
it just means she sounds credible
whereas and similarly
if you hear the story about the ed henry
accuser
it doesn't really sound credible
but maybe if you hear or tell it in
person it would be i don't know
that's separate um
did do they come across like mary trump
yeah mary trump did not come across
as credible and i believe the mary trump
story is largely just going away
does anybody remember mary trump she
sold about a million books in the first
day
so she did okay all right
um
did eckart believe she was providing a
service for
a promotion oh that's the accuser
so yes did this did the accuser think
that
she was doing something for a promotion
no but she did
um she did suggest
that being nice to somebody who had some
you know some weight at the at the
network
could be good for her career but that
crosses into the territory of
but wasn't she sort of using her
attractiveness
to further her career and that you don't
know
because that would be an internal
thought and nobody has
nobody knows what any of these people
were thinking
so if you're if you're convicting
somebody based on what you think they're
thinking
that's always that's always sketchy
did the left docks me um
not i'm kind of hard to dox
because how would you do that i don't
know
would i care if people came to my home
yeah i guess it's a different situation
for me
because some homes are better armed than
others
and some people like attention more than
other people
honestly this is no joke i i often
fantasize about an
angry mob protesting my house
and when i imagine it i'm never afraid
i'm just sort of excited
thinking i got an angry mob in front of
my house this is so cool
i i don't know if i could be doxxed
because an angry mob in front of my
house would just sort of amuse me
and i think i would just get more
twitter followers i would definitely
live stream it
so i guess it would be bad
for me allegedly
i don't know
no i don't want to be doxxed but i also
can't imagine
it turning out bad for me and that maybe
that's a flaw with my personality
is that i like attention more than i
worry about
more than i worry about risk
and by the way if if they'd like to find
out what would happen
i'd like to find out too let's find out
together
and by the way i know exactly what i
would do
if an angry mob came to my house
the first thing i do is walk directly
into it
so the first thing i do is i would leave
my house and walk
right into the middle of the of the mob
now you should not do that but i would
do that
and the and then once i walked into the
middle of the mob
and they would be yelling at me and i
don't know trying to push me around or
whatever
i would look at one of them and say
who's in charge
and then i wouldn't yell i'd just say a
quiet to whoever was near me pushing me
or whatever they're doing
say which one of you guys is in charge
who's in charge here
can i talk to whoever's in charge and
watch what would happen to the group
when you ask who's in charge
they wouldn't know how to handle it
because nobody's in charge
or or if somebody is in charge you say
okay can i talk to you
what's your issue
and just talk it through
so there's if the
the technique here by the way and again
i do not recommend
do not recommend that any of you do what
i just suggested
probably better just to stay in your
home that's what i would recommend
uh call authorities if you need to but
i wouldn't do what i would do the reason
it would work in my case
is that i know how to change people's
frame
so if the frame is they're protesting my
house
they will act like they're protesting my
house if you walk into the middle of
their crowd
and ask them who's in charge what is
that
what is it it's not really a protest
anymore because the guy you're
protesting just walked into the middle
of your crowd
and asked if he could talk to you it
kind of ruins it
like all the fun is gone and then when
they start talking to me
they'd find out i'm not nearly as crazy
as they thought
maybe i don't even disagree with them on
a lot of stuff
and it would just sort of ruin the fun
so
don't do that but there are some few
people who would be
sufficiently trained to do that let me
i'll give you one other good example
mike cernovich could do that mike's
i don't again i don't recommend it
because you know
anything could be dangerous but if you
actually knew how to handle that
situation
you could actually just walk into it and
diffuse it but there aren't too many
people who would have those skills
um so i gotta
i gotta admit i would be a little bit
excited by it
and again that's probably a personality
flaw it's nothing i can be proud of
somebody says someone will sucker punch
you they might
they might that would be the risk
wouldn't it
but you know if somebody did suck or
punch me
i would chase them to the end of the
earth
that's one difference between me and
other people is that
i would definitely find out who it was
and i would chase them to the end of the
earth
it would be my life's mission to make
that right
anyway that's it for me i'll talk to you
later
