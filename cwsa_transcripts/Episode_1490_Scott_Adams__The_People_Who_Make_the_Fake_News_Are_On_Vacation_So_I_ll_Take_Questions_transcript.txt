good morning ladies and gentlemen
and every every other species and
type of person because you're you're all
special
welcome to the best
live stream of all time it's called
coffee with scott adams and it features
something have you heard of it
it's called the simultaneous sip yeah
yeah i know some of you have heard of it
hold on let me stretch my lavalier
microphone cords
to reach over here
and grab my notes
well i'll be taking some questions today
because there's not much news
it's the weekend it's a holiday weekend
and wow this is slow news
slow slow news
but
one way to make this uh situation
spectacular
well there's a few ways but uh one way
to do it
is the simultaneous sip
and if you'd like to join in and i know
you would all you need is a copper mug
or glass a tanker jealous a canteen
jerry flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day
one of the top two things you can do
with one hand it's called the
simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen right now go
was it good for you
yeah it was wasn't it
yeah
sometimes you think i don't know if it's
going to be good this time and that it
is
it is
it's amazing
well let's talk about the fake news
because there isn't much real news
i think the people who make the fake
news are mostly on vacation
so we have to rely on actual
organic real news
not much happening
you got basically helicopter accidents
and and rain that's all you got for news
all right anyway uh rolling stone ran a
story and tweeted
about uh
an interview with a doctor and it was
associated with some oklahoma hospital
and he claimed
he claimed
that the hospital was turning away
gunshot
victims
and other people because it was overrun
with people
who were doing overdose levels of uh
horse dewormer also known as
ivermectin
horse dewormer yes in fact
in fact according to rolling stones so
many people
had uh
heard fake news about this
therap therapeutic
that they had run out and instead of
buying the
human version which is available
no
they decided to buy the horse dewormer
version because that makes sense
and they took so much of this horse
dewormer
which i paused to warn you
not a good idea
don't do it that they that they were
packing the icu's and the emergency
rooms and those hospitals could barely
stay in
what
oh it was all fake news
uh personal apparently the doctor who
gave the interview is
not really even working at that hospital
had some vague association with it and
the hospital says absolutely none of
that is true
the total number of people
who are in their hospital for
horse dewormer overdose is zero
zero
now how many other outlets picked up
that fake news and ran with it
a lot of them
so
i didn't see it myself but i saw a
reference to sea then and some other
places may have picked it up
i'd like to think some other news
organizations
were maybe holding off on that
but there's your fake news
um but as ian miles chiang says
on twitter he points out
that a lot of people were debunking that
story as as they should
but uh who was debunking the story that
said that japan was going to make
ivermectin a
standard part of their coronavirus
treatment
and i said what because i did see some
kind of a story about japan using ivor
meccan but turns out there was just one
guy
and it was just a suggestion
so there's nothing even close to
japan
formalizing some kind of ivermectin
recommendation it was just one guy
just a suggestion
um
new york times is getting some grief
over having to change a headline
now you may have noticed that as the
public sentiment
toward biden
sinks
uh probably in lockstep with the the
media
that the media is turning on biden a
little bit
the the media that normally supports him
but here's the funniest example of them
uh
getting caught
trying to make that pivot
so the new york times uh
was doing a story about biden meeting
with the gold star families who lost
lost uh children grown children
um
in afghanistan and the original headline
said quote
biden
still grieving his son
finds that not everyone wants to hear
about it
so the the essence of it was that he was
talking too much about his own grief
and maybe not enough about
the grief of the the people he was there
to to console
and
i guess the new york times
got quite a backlash on that
they got a backlash surprise there are
enough people who support biden that
they uh they created a backlash and
within hours
the the headline was changed and it got
changed to
an invoking bow
biden broaches a loss that's guided his
presidency
look at the difference in that let me
read them again so original headline
biden still grieving his son finds that
not everyone wants to hear about it
because there were some complaints about
it
but other people supported it and said
that it made them feel connected
and that and then that changed too in
invoking beau biden broaches a loss
that's guided his presidency
that's a that's kind of an interesting
and subtle little back battle there
all right one of the things i love is
watching the battle between
fox news and cnn and specifically the
on-air talent
because the on-air talent likes to get
personal with their counterparts at the
other network and i got to say
it's one of my favorite things about the
media right now is that they go after
each other almost every day
and you know mock each other
and i was i was trying to think
how important is it
and the answer is it might be kind of
important
it might be the kind of thing that
changes elections
take for example the current story about
jim acosta
he was he did a little commentary on cnn
and he was label labeling tucker carlson
quote
a human manure spreader you know and
accused him of various racist conspiracy
theories whatever
now it doesn't matter what he's accusing
him of because they're always going back
and forth on stuff
but imagine this
consider the size of tucker carlson's
audience
and the size of fox news's you know
reach
tucker's probably
the most important voice on the right at
this point if you just take the amount
of his influence and multiply it by the
the size of his audience
i don't know if anybody would have a
bigger number multiplying you know if
you could theoretically come up with
some kind of a number or grade
for how influential somebody is on top
of how big their audience is
i don't know if anybody would have a
bigger combination so imagine if you
will
that
uh cnn could manage to
take tucker carlson off the air
now they would do it presumably just
because it would be good for competition
right they try to take out their
competitor
but what would happen to the republic
how many people do you think
hypothetically
theoretically if i could use it in a
non-scientific sense
how many people do you think
tucker carlson
influences to vote the way they vote
it's not zero
but is it enough that if you took his
voice out i see rush limbaugh being
mentioned in the comments yeah same
thing if you take down a rush limbaugh
greg guffeld you know if you know the
the people who've got the biggest
audiences
do you change votes
you know i asked
on twitter i asked my twitter followers
i don't know a few years ago i asked how
many people
decided to vote for trump
because of something i said
and i think i got 1500 people said they
changed their vote
specifically because of something i said
now that was just my tiny little twitter
following
and the people who
saw that twitter poll
and also wanted to answer it
so
i had 1500 people
after all of those filters
that said directly that i changed their
vote
how many people
have their vote changed by a tucker
carlson
or a hannity
or a
rush limbaugh it's a big number
you know we we could find out that the
passing of rush limbaugh ends up
changing the
you know the the look of america
it may it could be enough because all of
our presidential elections are kind of
close
so
one major voice taken off the field
if it's you know somebody as big as a
tucker or where a limbaugh was
i don't know could that change politics
i think he could
hypothetically
all right
so
that's fun
um
i just tweeted just before i got out
here and so it's worth checking it out
on my twitter feed it would be near the
top
so andres beckhaus was doing some
translating on a german
viral i think he's a virologist an
expert
talking about basically the only way we
have out of the pandemic
and what was special about it is it
seemed like it was the first honest
expert opinion that i've seen
because you know i keep asking
what exactly is the strategy well what
are we trying to do are we still
flattening the curve or trying to get to
zero
it feels like it's not being expressed
in a way that the public can say okay i
like it or i don't like it but at least
i know what it is
like i understand it and then every
country is doing its own thing in every
state
so you don't really have a good sense of
what the the strategy is and so that's
what this this piece describes from this
expert
and the basic idea is this so you want
to get from a pandemic where you know
people are dying and it's affecting the
uh or they're buying they're dying at
too large a rate
and it's affecting the economy in life
and all that you want to get to the
point where it's just sort of endemic
where it's something you live with
because it's not going away
so here's an expert saying
it's not going away
so so let's just hear this as clearly as
we can
new zealand
it's not going away
it's just not going away right so that's
the first part
of the strategy you need to know it's
not going away
so
um
how do you live with it and his
suggestion is that if you got over
vaccinated if such a thing existed it
might not be good
because
if too few people get the infection
you can't get to the better kind of
immunity where people just learn to live
with it like a cold basically
so
the idea is that maybe the best strategy
is to be vaccinated and infected
but in the long run you want the
vaccinations and the infections to be at
a low rate
so that they're not you know wiping out
our health care system
so i don't know if anybody said that
directly before have they has anybody
said directly
we want to be vaccinated
and infected
because it's the only way to get from
pandemic to endemic where you just live
with it
yeah i'm seeing in the comments somebody
says i i said it well that's true but i
i don't think anybody who had
credentials had said it out loud that
i've heard of
so
so that would be interesting
now that's just one person giving their
one opinion it doesn't mean it's any
country's strategy yet but it should be
um
twitter user paul collider um
had an observation that
i think is uh pretty meaningful
as we're trying to sort out
you know ivor mechtin and
what's real and what's not
and
paul notes that
no horse has died of covet
and i thought to myself
well that's true
no horse
has died of cove
at least as far as we know now if we've
learned anything from the election
the last election it's that if a court
has not found any fraud then there was
none
because the court didn't find it
likewise if there are no news reports of
any horses dying of covid well there are
none that's proof
no reports of it means there are none
just like the election
and
since we know uh horses take this
ivermectin stuff for horses
don't you put that in your body people
i'm talking about horse
dewormer
made for horses
don't put it in your body
but
if horses are taking it
and no horses have died of covet
i'm just putting it out there
ipso facto qed
logic that's called logical that's how
it works
uh if any dumb people are watching i'm
just joking just joking
cnn has their anec
anecdotal persuasion brainwashing of the
day
every day they will have a story about
somebody who tragically had a bad
outcome with
uh coven 19 who wishes now they had been
vaccinated oh boy do they wish now they
had been vaccinated
so today's is the florida teen
who spent 11 days on a ventilator nearly
died
she but she's looks like she'll be okay
now and she has a message for her peers
that they should get vaccinated
did i mention obese
oh the story doesn't mention her weight
but the photograph does
feels like that's important to the story
and yet
overlooked
but the photograph tells that story
because if we're not telling people to
lose weight
and we're only telling them to get
vaccinated i feel as if
part of the story
has been left down
all right i asked this provocative
question on twitter i said does it
really matter if we ever have proof that
the wuhan lab was the source of the
coronavirus
now almost every one of you is going to
say something like of course it matters
of course it matters
because if you don't know the source of
the leak number one
how are you ever going to correct what
the problem was
number two you got to hold somebody
accountable
you got to hold china accountable if
they came from there and if it didn't
come from there well then we should back
off of china that would only be fair so
yes
yes it matters a lot
no it doesn't
it doesn't matter at all
it doesn't matter even a little bit
because china will always say it didn't
come from there
right is there anything we could
possibly do
in any universe that would make china
say oh you got us
you got us yup
came from there
so there will always be competing
stories there will always be people
saying it did and there'll always be
major entities saying it didn't
so that's not going to change
now
what is it that we would fix
if we found out it did come from china
what would we do
differently
would we say hey
now that we know this got out from the
lab
i'm just brainstorming here but why
don't we try to make the
deadly virus lab
as secure as we can
is that what they're going to do
or were they already trying to do that
is it possible
that they tried already to make it as
secure as they possibly could
and did they
did they
uh maybe take it up another notch
not even knowing if it came from the lab
don't you think they maybe took it up
another notch
probably
and it doesn't matter if we ever find
out it came from that lab because
they're still they're still going to
treat it like it did
so i think in terms of you know finding
out how it got out we're never going to
know who's yeshua came out on
you know just to use a silly example
we're not going to know
you know which
crack in the window the the first
coronavirus snuck through
right
i mean even if we found out it came from
the lab and i'm just joking about the
examples obviously we're not going to
know exactly how it got out of the lab
we'll just know well looks like came
from there somehow
so the best we can do
is you know triple our efforts to make
labs that have any kind of danger in
them extra extra safe
and i'm sure they're doing that anyway
aren't you
i mean i feel like they would be doing
that anyway
no matter what
so i don't buy the argument that we
would do anything differently
because we're probably doing everything
we can
next
what about holding china accountable
well
you can't hold them accountable in it in
the normal way
because they'll just say they didn't do
it
they'll just say it really came from
america it's propaganda
and you can't hold them accountable by i
don't know what
giving them the bill
are we going to invoice them
and china is going to be oh
darn it we've been saying we had nothing
to do with this but now we have an
invoice
well i guess i guess we have to pay the
10 trillion dollars
write a check will you write that check
i mean that's not going to happen
and do you imagine that there's some
kind of retaliation we would do for this
that we're not doing for the uyghurs
that we're not doing over our trade
injustices you know stealing our ip
suddenly we're going to get tough
like this will be the thing that makes
us get tough
i doubt it
because i think we're doing everything
that you can do
with a nuclear superpower that's you
know a gigantic part of the world
economy there's just so much you can do
we're probably already at the edge of it
so
i think if you really thought about it
you would learn that
it will never matter if we know where i
came from it just won't ever matter
and what else is going on well
ron desantis and florida they've got
this deal where they're going to
find any entity in florida 5 000
if that entity requires a vaccination
proof
so if the only way you can use a company
is by proving you're vaccinated
florida
will now find you five thousand dollars
to which i say
unless
unless trump runs for reelection
the republicans can just skip the
primaries
because i feel like
it's just got to be you know it's got to
be desantis right
i can't imagine anybody else would even
have a chance at this point he's doing
such a populist
you know spot-on
this is what the people want even if
maybe science disagrees it's what the
people want
and that's who vote
so
uh
it's kind of perfect again but again you
know if if trump decides to run i'm sure
he'll get the nomination
but here's the counter-argument
as popular as this is because people
don't like
or a lot of people don't like the
vaccination proof idea
there's a little bit of a pushback on
the free market concept
which is why can't a business decide
to
do any kind of business they want
if they're not discriminating based on
let's say race or religion
uh and not really discriminating on uh i
don't know disability or anything else
really
if they're not doing one of the
forbidden discriminations
why can't a a company in the united
states
say
you must wear a shirt
they can
right they can say we won't serve you if
you don't wear a shirt
um what about shoes
they can say you can't come in our our
place if you don't have shoes
so why can't they say you can't come in
if you don't have a vaccination i'm not
this is not my argument
i'm just giving the argument right so
don't blame me i'm just telling you what
the argument is
that's not it's not a bad argument
i i feel as if i have a little conflict
on this one don't you
don't you have a little conflict on this
one
because it seems like there are two
things that you that we want and we
can't have them both
what we would want perhaps is to use any
business you want whether you're
vaccinated or not some of you would many
of you wouldn't
uh but you'd also like free markets
can't have both i guess
pick one
well joe rogan announces good news he
has uh
um
tested negative for covind
so he i guess he wasn't vaccinated i'm
pretty sure that's the story but he did
give it the whole cocktail of
therapeutics from
monoclonals to vitamin d drip to
ivermectin to i don't know what else
and
he says now he is testing negative for
covent
now normally
that would only mean that he was
negative because the test just tests the
human being but what if
he also had horse worms in his digestive
system
could the worms themselves
also have coveted
well i'm not sure that that would be
picked up in the test but we don't have
to worry about that because he took the
ivermectin
and so even if in the unlikely event he
had any horse worms in him
they would be dead too
because of the ivor mexican so i think
that's as thoroughly as uh
as dewormed and uh
d-virus as you can get
so joe rogan might be
the healthiest person on the planet
because not only
does he not have covet
he's immune as hell
and he definitely does not have worms
so
good on him for being that healthy but
here's the thing to watch
there is a big
big second part of the story
and
unless something barks it's a dog not
barking problem
kinda i overuse that
analogy
but uh and it goes like this
god forbid nobody wants this to happen
of course
but what if he has long-haul symptoms
i don't want to jinx it so you know
knock on wood
let's say that he doesn't have that
but there's a risk here remember i was
talking about tucker carlson and the big
media figures they do change votes
there they're you know 20 people or so
you can name
that absolutely can change how we think
about a topic and they can do it
overnight
what happens if he gets long haul
now i'm not even sure long haul is real
right i mean people report it people are
very credible in reporting it doctors
report having it dr drew for example
so you know to me it looks completely
credible
but you know we live in a world where we
could be surprised about just about
anything these days so maybe it's not
even real
you know maybe it's just a series of
coincidences
but what if it's real well actually even
if it's not
uh if
if joe rogan had any kind of health
problem after after this
people are going to associate it with
long haul even if it's not
right so people are going to be watching
his uh post
you know post-infection recovery like
nobody else's since trump i guess
and because joe rogan is sort of also
famous for his you know healthy fitness
related lifestyle
if he were to get
long haul that's gonna change the whole
conversation
so let's hope that doesn't happen for
his benefit primarily
um
i i almost don't want to even talk about
this next thing because it's sad but i
think we need to talk about it dana
preno's dog jasper america's dog has
passed away after nine years
and i gotta say it's like the saddest
thing that i've seen in the news in a
long time
i
uh it actually affected me you know i
mean it's not even my dog and if you
don't watch fox news you don't know what
i'm talking about but
she she sort of made her her personal
dog
a character that you know everybody who
watched the show would know and and love
and quite successfully sort of you know
built it into her brand and stuff
and uh you ended up loving that dog even
though you didn't know it
you felt like you knew it
it was like a dog you felt like you knew
and i swear
i don't feel that way when humans die
you know unless i know them pretty well
but somebody else's dog and
you know i've become a mess
so
that
is uh
is the content that i have for today so
as i told you it's sort of a slow news
day
um so i'm going to take some questions
if you have any
don't know if you have any
um
but i'll i'll pick out as many as i can
so what are the odds we'll be in full
pandemic mode in 2022 when the election
happens
um not zero
i don't know it's like a 50 50. i think
you make no news fun how's boo
uh boo uh is mewing differently but she
seems happy
um
looks like
it looks like she's uh
maybe recovering from whatever her
problem was
but i'll have her take i'll have
somebody take a look at her
um
what's the recall election looking like
well i don't know can we trust any polls
uh that are close
when the polls are saying that something
is 48
and you need 50 percent
talk about the recall election in
california
uh that feels too close to call
so i don't have any special insight into
that except that
we might see
sort of a trump derangement syndrome
kind of a shy voter thing happening
maybe
so the closer it is to 50
i would say the higher the likelihood
the recall will happen
somebody has a dilbert lunch box over on
locals get a picture of it
uh the smoke here is terrible
uh where i am will hypnosis help you
learn another language i've never heard
of that i would be skeptical that that
would be a useful
use of it
um
would you do a mini lesson on overcoming
ocd well so here's the problem
um
you know because i'm not a medical
professional
something as serious as ocd that's not
really something i'd mess with
so uh just being a
a hypnotist who knows about persuasion
that that doesn't get you to where you
should be messing with ocd now there may
be some things i could suggest that you
could try that would be you know
obviously harmless
but
beyond that i wouldn't i'd stay away
from that one i think
where do i buy my weed i'd rather not
say but it's legal in california
i love the fact that it can be delivered
i'll tell you golden age
best time management tip i'm going to
give you the most
non-obvious time management tip over
here
do too many things
now you say to yourself well that's
you know that's pretty contrarian if you
have too many things to do then you're
busier
how is that good time management well
one of the things i discovered when
dilbert took off and i was still doing
my day job and i was trying to write a
book and
i was so busy you couldn't even believe
it
i found out that it was easier to turn
people down
if they knew how busy you were
so if you get busy enough
to the point where everybody says uh
he's never gonna even answer you know
take my call
when you're so legendarily busy
that people don't even ask you something
because they know that you're never
gonna get to it
then you're free
and it's really hard to get there
but i'm going to reveal a secret
i'm going to tell you something i've
never admitted for my entire career
on those years when i was the busiest
and i was legitimately quite busy it was
really easy to find time for myself
because i could just say i'm so busy i
can't get back to you
and it was true
but because of that
i could just ignore everybody
because everybody thought i was working
on something else
so if i didn't get back to you you
thought well i understand he's got 10
things to do
but since 19 and 20 things were going to
be late anyway
i could just take the day off
and so
if you can push all the way past busy
to the point where you're so busy you
can't possibly get things done
like nobody would even expect
that you could possibly handle the
mountain of things you have to do once
you get there
you're free
[Laughter]
i've never admitted that before it was
my finest trick and i i discovered it
completely by accident
when people would start contacting me
and saying i know you can't get back to
me but
i'd be like well i guess i'm free
it was it was awesome
how was the air show so christine is in
her second day of the air show today
so she she did two flights yesterday
and she's got i think at least one more
maybe two more today
and then we'll have some kind of a
judging i guess
will the recall vote in california have
shenanigans
well
i feel we're at the point where
elections are determined by the rule
makers not the voters because everything
ends up close in terms of the voters and
the difference is what rules they use
that year
did you allow ballot harvesting yes or
no so i think all that stuff determines
who
who gets elected
um
let's see
when hub tokens
well i wish i could give you better news
on the wenhub tokens but i will tell you
that uh there is at least one
app under development that would make
use of them
now
uh that's not enough of a tip to go out
and you know load up on when tokens
but it's true
there i i do have personal knowledge of
an app
that's under development
um
that would use the tokens
uh what is the proper spelling of your
wife's name oh it's a k-r-i christina
um
nah everything is close yeah that's true
can you start over sure
do you like trains
that is an interesting question do i
like trains
well i like their
uh
energy efficiency
but otherwise i'm not too excited about
it
um
oh thank you ed
yeah
you know i heard a lot about that
so ed is talking about how during the
early part of the pandemic i was doing
morning and evening
live streams and i was doing it
specifically because people needed to be
talked off the ledge and the regular
media wasn't providing much
entertainment
so
i was just jumping in to do what i could
now i didn't realize how much difference
it made
because i'm still hearing you know a
year later
uh people are still contacting me and
telling me that
some version of it it really helped them
or saved their life or
kept them sane or something along those
lines so you never know
yeah and i'm saying in the comments
people are
people are confirming that you never
really know
captain
uh
i'm still seeing uh
the the blanket that i used during the
pandemic
by the way how many of you
know the inside joke about the blanket
and i'm not going to tell you what the
the what the answer is but how many in
the comments how many know that the
the plaid blanket was always an inside
joke
i've seen some people say yes now most
of you won't know it so it would be
unusual if you knew it but uh
let's say it's a deep joke
um
it's a reference to something
so that that can be your uh
your homework
uh if i if i told you it would ruin it
so i would tell you because um i i agree
with the rule
that if you bring it up
you need to finish it
do you have that rule
the rule should be that if you bring it
up you should have to finish it
uh but i was waiting for somebody in the
comments to do it for me all right so on
locals somebody
solved the puzzle
yeah so it's a reference to something in
a book i wrote called god's debris
and
if i finished explaining what that's
about it would be a spoiler for the book
so you don't want to hear from me so
don't don't spoil the book i'll just say
that it was a
it was a reference to something and if
you knew what the reference is
it would be funny to you that's all
right king salmon fish says
it's easier to hack the people than the
systems even some lames
decide the fate of the yeah you know it
is that's probably true it's easier to
brainwash the voters than it is to hack
the system
but if you can do both
even better
so
let me ask this for those of you on
youtube did today's live stream seem any
different
uh to the people on locals
wink wink
just so just for the youtube people
was there anything uh different that you
noticed today
uh the lights somebody said oh yes it's
just a little bit darker that's true
somebody said uh
the mic
somebody said it's slower
okay darker lighting some audio issues
mary just says yes but doesn't say what
most of you think it's the lighting
oh um somebody says that my energy was i
guess both high and low
so did my energy go up and down was that
it
my t-shirt
what's different is my t-shirt
so it looks like
this was just like every other live
stream
except for the lighting and possibly no
it's not a v-neck
i'm just being sloppy here
i use two microphones because i'm live
streaming
by the way uh let me give you an update
on my
attempt to live stream on the rumble
platform
uh
we're still in the phase where i asked
to be a creator and then nothing happens
so
i'll keep updating you
so we're on day day whatever of
either i'm waiting for them or they're
waiting for me
so
this was it's always one of those things
and i'm part of the problem myself
um
all right i think that's all i wanted to
talk about today so i'm gonna go run oh
somebody says how's the drumming
let me tell you the the process of
learning drumming at my age is way more
interesting
than i think that if i than if i'd
learned it you know as a kid
now part of the problem is of course
i'll never be good at it because if you
don't learn it at least young ish i
don't think he could ever be good at it
and
so i'm just trying to get to a point
where i could you know play along with
some popular song now i think i'll get
there i'm getting pretty close but
uh it's fascinating to follow the
thought process the learning process
to learn about how you learn
and to to watch it happen as it's
happening and such and there's a whole
mental process
that you have to get yet and and you're
effectively you're
rewiring your own brain
and the fact that you can
disassociate your limbs
so that your right hand your left hand
your right leg and your left leg and
even
maybe even your shoulders
are independently and then your brain
all doing different functions
so
and the fact that you know you
especially at my age to imagine that at
my age
somewhat effortlessly
i just practice until i um i have what's
called separation
meaning that my limbs can operate
separately and i can have put them on
automatic
and then i can think of other things i
like thinking about the weather well all
five of my limbs are playing
like a b
it's amazing
you know you wouldn't think it's even
possible
uh
but watching that happen is just really
just fascinating you can feel your brain
getting rewired
uh yeah five of my limbs because my
shoulders involved that's my fifth one
uh video is great how did i solve it
well i'm using just a a cheap lavalier
clip-on for youtube but i'm going
through a road caster pro it's a mixer
so i think that does a little bit of
something to it on the locals platform i
started just going directly in because
i've got a new ipad
and i don't know if i don't know if the
processor is better or something but the
audio seems to work great on on locals
as well
what do you know
cannot share
oh that's such a tantalizing question
yeah that would be cheating because if i
told you what i know but i can't share
uh that would sort of obligate me to
tell you because you hate to bring up
something you know it'd be like as if i
told you well i know about the ufos
but i can't tell you how much would you
hate that
by the way i don't know about the ufos i
mean i have an opinion
that they're not real
but i don't know
give us a little chunk of cheese
well let me say this uh i will tell you
that the
there were there will probably be
additional real stories of the
the trump
era
so i can tell you that my version of
what happened for the last five years
does not match yours
and that there would be some number of
people who are
let's say
further behind the curtain
you know even than i am who would have
yet other versions
and
i think where they differ is knowing
what mattered
because there are lots of ways you can
look into into that house you know you
can look into the house through all
kinds of different windows and doors but
not everything matters
and there are versions of what happened
in which a different set of variables
are believed to be the ones that
mattered
so i'll just say that but it's more than
one view i'm not saying that there's one
magical view and that's mine and that's
the one you would adopt
um
all right i'll i'll be a dick and i'll
tell you
this is pretty dickish but i'll tell you
one thing
that the
that you don't have any idea
what topics i've influenced directly
and i'm talking about really directly
and you probably never will
because by their nature
you know they're things that i either
would never be able to talk about or not
for a long time
but
there's a whole lot going on
that i had some kind of substantial
impact on that you'll just never hear
about
and
uh
so much so that if i tell anybody
privately you know because privately
there's nothing i wouldn't talk about
none of it is state secrets by the way
i'm not talking about any kind of like
you know deep
like shocking secrets that would change
the nature of reality i'm just talking
about things i know that that other
people
might not know
and
uh it would really change your your view
of things but anyway when i tell people
privately they literally don't believe
it
so one of the reasons that i can't tell
you
or i can't tell you in public and i'm
not talking about one thing i'm talking
about a a collection of things you know
it's more more like a narrative that's a
little different than one you've seen
it's literally not believable
actually literally
not believable
and so it really prevents me from
telling it because it's not believable
it would be like
for example this is this is not the case
but it would be like this
it would be like an actual angel came
down and talked to me privately
and gave me some secrets
and then i went and say hey
you're not going to believe this
but an angel
no no a real one a real angel came to me
and gave me some secrets
and uh and then you'd say
okay we're done here
i do not believe an angel talk to you
and i'd say no no that's not the
important part let me tell you the
secrets
and you'd be like
maybe keep your secrets because i don't
believe an angel
came down to earth and talked to you and
i'd be like don't get obsessed by that
part i'm just going to tell you
what he told me
like yeah
maybe not
yeah i know what you're thinking
all right
so that's all for now
and uh i will talk to all of you
tomorrow
see you then
you
