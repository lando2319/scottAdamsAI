good morning everybody
and welcome
yes once again to the best thing that's
ever happened it's called coffee with
scott adams now
i don't know if you've noticed
the regular viewers
that if i tell you you're going to have
a good day
it will make it more likely
why
because
reality is subjective
you might have exactly the same amount
of problems but if you come here every
day and i tell you it's going to be
great
it'll be a little bit greater as far as
you can tell and that's all that matters
now
how would you like to
take this experiment up a notch
it's called the simultaneous sip and
there is plenty of science
to suggest
indirectly
that it might make your day better but i
guarantee it and all you need is a
copper mug or a glass attacker jealous
designing a canteen pick a flask of
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite
liquid
i like coffee
now join me for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day i
think that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
will be
sipped around the world
now go
exactly i see in the comments
if i may read this comment it's the best
thing that's ever happened to me
a lot of people would put it in the top
ten
but i think it properly belongs in the
top three i will allow that the birth of
your children
possibly your wedding day if things went
well
could be better days maybe maybe if
those things went perfectly you know i
would say the bad version of all those
things is still
worse than the good version
of coffee with scott adams but the best
i'll give you i'll give you that the
best version of those things
would have a little bit of an edge
well here's an update beep beep beep
beep beep beep beep it's a fake news
update uh do you remember do you
remember the story about the guy
who wanted to vote back in 2020 he
wanted to vote but he could not find any
way to get a government id
here's an update on that story
he still doesn't exist
still doesn't exist
okay
all right next item uh
how would you like me to fix fake news
i mean actually do it like right here
i'm going to perform a magic trick are
you ready
i'm go i'm going to describe an app
or maybe maybe it's a process it doesn't
have to it doesn't have to be an app
it could be
something that gets the same thing done
and it goes like this
number one
how much do you dislike commercials
on your television
i think you don't like them at all
wouldn't you wish that if you were
watching live tv
where you can't fast forward
that you could have something entertain
you during the commercials
and yet
here's the key
and yet
have the thing that entertains you
during the commercials
be on the same topic or within the same
field as the show you were just watching
and so
i submit to you
what i call
news buddies
what it is
it's a live stream could be on an app
but it could be just live stream
that is at the same time as the live
network broadcast or
cable broadcast
of cnn
fox news
msnbc and so if you're watching any of
those shows
you can have call up on your other
device
so let's say you're watching the news on
your television because you're a certain
age you watch a television
and you call up your phone
a little uh pers a real person
who at exactly the same time for you and
other people watching the same show
will be your little uh news buddy
it'll be like a little avatar that just
sits there on your phone and is
completely silent mostly
during the actual broadcast
the moment the broadcast moves to a
commercial
you can silence your tv
and then have the little
news buddy
say you know that story you just watched
that's kind of fake news because it's a
little bit out of context here's what
they left out
and you'd be and what would you rather
do would you rather listen to the
commercial
would you would you rather listen to the
commercial
or would you rather listen to somebody
tell you what was wrong with what you
just watched
which is more entertaining because
that's all that matters right now let's
say it's free
could be could easily be free because if
you put it on
let's say on youtube
you could have the maybe the commercials
run i don't know if could he do this
make the commercials run on your buddy
app at a different time as the ones on
the tv
so that you never get commercials at the
same time i think you can do that
but you can do it on an app if you build
it yourself
and so therefore you wouldn't have to
listen to the commercial maybe it's just
running in video
it doesn't even have any sound
while the news buddy is talking
and now
let's say that you don't like one of the
news buddies
because it looks like that's another
propaganda
you pick another one
and other people can judge the other
news buddies and pick one you like
so there should be somebody who and by
the way there wouldn't be any copyright
problem
because the news buddy would not be
showing the stream
you would have to have your own separate
stream for cnn or whatever it is you're
watching
now you have the news buddy doing a
little fact checking
while the live news is on
and then the news buddy could even hold
on that gets better
send you links
to the fact checks huh
huh
in real time
in real time
so your little news buddy you know as
soon as it goes to commercial it says
you know what they said about climate
change
well some people say that that's not
true here's a link you'd be like
seriously
i totally believe that there's a link
that says the opposite
now how many senior citizens
how many senior citizens could handle
you know having a news buddy on the
phone plus the tbi okay over a certain
age i'll give you
that it would decline in usability but
it's also over the certain age that
they're not as active
in anything
so
you tell me that
people in their 50s and 60s can't handle
opening an app
on the phone i say no of course they can
so the people that you're really trying
to reach even the older segment can
absolutely
turn on a simultaneous app that's not
even hard
so
so here's something that
i would like to
give you as a general concept
if i had told you before you'd ever
heard of something called a jury trial
that i was going to design this justice
system
where 12
of your peers would be selected and then
vetted by lawyers and we'd have all this
checks and balances and a judge and but
ultimately there'd be 12 people would
decide if you go to jail or not
how many of you would have thought that
would work
seriously
yeah be be honest with yourself
if the jury system had never existed and
somebody described it to you and said i
got this great idea
would you think that was going to work
really
i don't know some of you maybe maybe
better than the alternatives
what about the supreme court you know
think of all the all your problems with
the supreme court all the complaints you
have if somebody had described
the supreme court before anybody knew it
ever existed it was just a whole new
idea
would you have heard that and said yeah
i think that's going to last at least
200 years
people will find that very credible
i don't know
maybe
maybe you would have thought it was
better than the other ideas
so you know that'd be good enough but
i'm not sure that we're so smart that we
know that we can't engineer systems
to
at least make us satisfied that we've
done the best job we can
so when i was talking the other day
about could you have a supreme court of
fact checking
how many of you said ugh you can't do
that because then the fact checkers
would just be
you know bought off by somebody and then
you think of all the reasons why it
doesn't work
i i get that
every one of the reasons why why you
offer that that wouldn't work
if you designed it incorrectly
yeah you're right it wouldn't work
but
don't underestimate the ingenuity of the
public to design something that does
work
even if we get it wrong you know 19 to
20 times if you just keep chugging along
you're gonna get something that works so
when i talk when i talk about this the
news buddy
app
the only thing i'm trying to to transmit
is that you'd be surprised how many
thorny impossible seeming
problems could be solved
if you just chug along and try enough
things doesn't mean this will be the
solution
to have a little news buddy because you
know the obvious thing is they become
corrupted blah blah
but
we do have a history
of solving problems that i would say are
like this ish
in the sense that you can't imagine how
you could get the bias and the
and the criminality out of it
but we seem to
largely be able to fix those things it
just takes a while so i don't know if
the news buddies the way but something
cool
could probably uh fix the fake news
i don't think what's going to fix it is
competing platforms
that's my best guess
do you
do you think that the fake news will
ever be fixed
by somebody coming up with a competing
platform that's oh that's all the good
news so we'll watch that one instead
it doesn't feel like it right
and so since we've tried that
in effect
you
should we not try something else
right
so somebody cleverly is saying so when
did you create this news buddy app
it would have been smarter to develop
the app before giving you the idea
but
i feel like it's more about the concept
of designing systems that work it's not
even about the app and i don't have that
much interest in that kind of an app but
it was a good question yes it was a good
question
[Music]
all right
um
what are the coolest things about being
me if i could be
all about me for a moment and why
wouldn't i be
is that every now and then i'll wake up
and just something cool will happen
that's just so cool you can barely
contain yourself and you didn't know it
was coming it's just hey it's cool
um i was curious about something related
to a story i'm going to talk about later
and i
and in order to talk about that other
story about an author being canceled i
wanted to google myself
and see if
you know what's the highest rated thing
about me to see if it was negative or
positive
and to compare it to this other story
and and i discovered that something like
three days ago there was a story
that the dilbert comic is going to be
featured in a
or already is in a rick and morty
episode
and
i guess they go to an alternative
universe or something
and uh
they go into an alternative universe
where there's a a dilbert world and
their
the desks are eating the people or
something
and here's what's weird
so this was four days ago actually this
was published
how in the world
did i not know about this
for four days
how in the world could there be a rick
and morty episode all about dilbert
it took four days for me to figure that
out and i had to find it myself
nobody nobody mentioned that to me
none of you
nobody really seriously
there's not one of you
there's not one of you who
already knew that and thought to mention
it come on i rely on you to
to tell me the obvious stuff
four days and i didn't know that now
call my agent now i don't have an agent
for that kind of stuff i have an agent
from my books
but not a general agent
so here's what i'd like to say
rick and morty is just about the best
thing on television
and
uh
being
featured in that even even if they mock
it i haven't seen it so they
i don't know if they
if they treat it like a cultural icon or
they treat it mockingly either way is
fine with me
because i'm such a fan of the show
my somebody says my audience doesn't
watch rick and morty
um
what's wrong with you
you should
yeah it's
it for i i would say it's my favorite
animated
show of all time
could i say that yeah i could i think i
could say that i think it's my favorite
animated show of all time
including my own
well finally the biden administration
and congress has passed
an anti-lynching bill
and i'm hoping this will
maybe stop the tide this rising
problem of lynching which i don't
believe has happened in a long time
um i don't know anybody who's opposed to
a bill against lynching you could argue
that the states already did it but i
don't mind that the government
you know the federal government makes it
official if you could say that
you know i i would say maybe it wasn't
the most important thing we were working
on
so if it was easy
you know it didn't cost anything
okay
i mean i i feel like it was unnecessary
work so
i'm not sure i would have done it solves
the problem that doesn't really exist
but as a messaging thing
sure i agree with the message
so if it didn't cost too much yeah
i'm not gonna hate it
um but i wonder was anyone on the other
side of that argument
like who
i mean
anybody who took the other side of this
argument was really not playing this
right
because
you know and i understand you might say
something like
oh we already have laws why waste our
time i get that
but don't say it don't say it
i understand if you think it
but how in the world could this be
politically smart
to be the one who gets singled out for
being against it
it's such an obvious trap
and here's that here's how i would have
played it
if i were in congress so that just so i
don't get caught in this you're against
the anti-lynching bill
i would have been more forth than
anybody i i would have been for
digging up people who had been for it
just to kill them again
i mean i would have been so for it
that if they ever talk to me i'd say are
you kidding unlike the number one person
in favor of this
which would make sense because i have
identified
as black for a while
um
but i noticed a trend
and can you tell me if this is bias or
is this real okay this is just something
i observe
so there's no science to it there's no
data to it just sort of my observation
does it seem to you that democrats are
tough on crime
when the crime isn't one that's actually
happening
am i wrong about that
i mean we've got the lynching they're
tough on lynching
which
thankfully
is basically not happening
if it ever does happen yeah i mean we
should go as hard on whoever does such a
horrible thing as we can
but it's interesting that they would
pick that as where they'd be tough on
crime
do you remember when the democrats
thought russia collusion was
real well they were pretty tough on that
weren't they
they were tough on that crime that oh
wait a minute that didn't exist
yeah so they're tough on that crime that
doesn't exist they're also tough on a
lot of crimes
of people thinking things wrong
so if you're thinking things wrong
they're really tough on that
i feel as if democrats are not really
understanding the whole
tough on crime concept and where to
apply it
and when not to apply it
is it just me
i don't know
it feels like a trend
or a pattern
maybe just my imagination
um
apparently the number of uh workers in
the workplace which is exactly where the
workers should be
uh if you see a worker not in the
workplace
send them back they belong in the
workplace
even at lunch we'll have no
no goofing off all right uh apparently
there are more people using drugs
in the workplace
but i was surprised that it's they say
it's risen to 4.6
of
a bunch of people were randomly tested
and i thought to myself
only 4.6
what workplace could you go into and
find only 4.6
or on drugs
and i thought oh oh
just certain drugs just certain drugs
if you tested all the people who were on
a drug that would affect their
performance
how many would that be
well that would be all of them it's just
some of them are legal
some of them are prescribed
some is coffee it's booze
but i would guess that 75 of the
workforce
is consciously changing their brain
chemistry
through drugs one way or the other i
mean maybe it's only on the weekend
yeah maybe it's sugar
anyway
joel pollock has a article in breitbart
in which she's talking about the
reparations
efforts in california
and he points out and i never thought of
this before the california had never
been a slave state
so i live in the state california they
they're never been slaves here it's
always been a free state
but we're talking about um and there's
some kind of committee
to come up with
a plan for reparations or to see if it's
practical
and
they've spent quite a bit of time so far
and here's what they came up with
it's just a preliminary like beginning
decision
to throw
other black people under the bus
so
progress so far
by by a committee that apparently is
largely black
to decide that uh only people who can
prove they were descended from slavery
in america would be eligible for the
reparations
so the very first thing that a largely
black committee did was find a new way
to divide
to divide people
at this time
this time dividing black people in
america
uh and in so doing they came up with a
new standard in which you'd have to be
able to demonstrate you were descended
from slaves if if any reparations were
ever approved right so it's all very
preliminary to which i asked the obvious
question
is it not discriminatory
to ask
black americans to have identification
for some government process
because we know that voting
it would be discriminatory to require a
government id
but yet the committee on reparations
believes that
the same public
that would find it a burden or at least
some of them would find it a burden to
get government id
would be able to plow through and prove
through what i know dna or maybe
a search of the public records that they
had descended from actual slaves in
america
um i'm not sure this committee is moving
the ball forward
if you know what i mean
i think they came up with a standard
that is so provocative that they've
reduced the chances of reparations am i
wrong
i think they just reduced the chance
that this could ever happen
let me tell you what you would have done
if you wanted to increase the chance
just find something that republicans
like too
that's it
just find something republicans like
for example
about something that would improve
education options for everybody who's
low income
which would be
very beneficial for the black american
community
because they find themselves in the
deepest hole especially with the
education system
so if you say let's fix the education
options you know maybe add choice
whatever for for everybody
then the republicans can say wait did
you say for everybody and then they say
yeah
and then somebody says but you know this
will disproportionately help
the black public because they're in a
deeper hole and the republicans say
we don't frickin care as long as it's
applied evenly
like right
nobody's going to complain
if it's applied to everybody evenly that
it has an outcome
that's a little biased
that's everything republicans want
so make a it would if it were hard to do
it i'd say don't try
but given that it would be the easiest
thing in the world to do
just come up with a plan the republicans
like
vote
done
bring the country together
fix the biggest source of systemic
racism which is the ina
the unequal education system
but if you fix the unequal education
system
granted there's a whole lifetime of
people you know who aren't going to get
that benefit or they could maybe maybe
do something with training and adult
education as well maybe
but if you did something that people
liked well maybe you'd get something
that's all i'd like to suggest
how about this
[Laughter]
is it possible for trump not to be trump
for a minute
don't we all think that we could be
trump better than trump
now here's the problem
for some things it feels like we could
but there are a whole bunch of things
you know you couldn't
yeah when you saw his uh letter
um talking about his hole in one that he
got
and you know even even people who are
not fans i had to admit it was well
written it was just hilarious and on
point and
it was just sort of perfect it was
self-mocking without being too
self-mocking it just had everything so
as an entertainment and a piece of
writing it was just brilliant in my my
opinion but then he does this
but then he does this
he's he's so hard
to unambiguously like
all right so i'm i'm a fan of course and
i liked him personally when i met him so
i liked the family they were all very
nice to me so i have only positive
feelings about them personally but he
get he's an interview with uh i guess
just the news
john solomon and uh
and trump called on russian president
vladimir putin to release any damaging
information he has about the biden
family
come on
come on
[Laughter]
he's up
so so trump is up something like i don't
know
seven points against
whoever runs against him if he were to
run as president again you know he has
this
pretty much commanding lead and
situation the only thing he could do
wrong
is say something that's that could be
spun as him siding with russia it's the
only thing he could do wrong
and he knows exactly what he's doing
he doesn't fly close to the sun by
accident
if this looked like if this looked like
an accident to you you haven't been
paying attention
this was no accident this was someone
saying
watch this
yeah
watch this
i feel like that's all it was
i feel like
he just said whatever is the most
provocative thing he could say
that would force people to demand an
apology or clarification which would not
which would not be forthcoming
so
you know when you see this sort of thing
juxtaposed with his statement about his
hole in one
the the hole in one statement
should give you a tip off
of when he's tongue-in-cheek
but it won't
because the people who want to interpret
as entirely you know entirely serious
they're just going to do that
so to me
i i wouldn't have done it
i wouldn't have done it
but
would i have been president of the
united states
no
no probably not
so whatever he does keeps working in
some ways
and then we're all geniuses when
something doesn't work we're like oh we
saw that coming why didn't he
well i don't know why you know we're all
confused a little bit about why things
keep working they shouldn't work
but he seems to know how to harness
energy
in this case he created energy out of
nothing
and then the energy will come you know
directed back at him
and then because he's an energy monster
he'll redirect the energy to his
advantage
so first he creates the energy
then he hands the energy to his enemies
they they they throw the energy at him
hey hey hey
look what you said and he says oh i got
more energy back than i gave you i gave
you uh
like 10 pounds of energy and you gave me
back a thousand pounds thank you thank
you
redirect
watching him do this in real time is
just such a lesson on
managing the public and everything else
i guess
well even uh the friendly news
um sources the friendly to the democrat
news sources are noting that biden's
gaffes are becoming a little bit harder
to explain
a little bit harder to explain
um
but now and now they've resorted to the
ridiculous
uh this is another
uh joel pollock also said this in a
tweet
by the way if you're not following
joel pollock
uh on
uh twitter you should be
don't don't wait for me to talk about it
um
but anyway when the white house defended
uh biden talking about
you know putin should not be in charge
and it sounded like
he wanted him removed but then he got
walked back
and now they're saying that
biden was speaking in his personal
capacity
and as joel points out
there's no such thing as a president's
personal capacity
what
what
you know maybe in some weird
philosophical way
but not in a real way
if you are the president of the united
states and you give an opinion about
what should happen in foreign affairs
that's not your personal opinion even if
it is your personal opinion
it doesn't doesn't even mean anything
when you're the actual president
so
and it's funny that
that it takes somebody to actually say
that
before you say oh yeah
there's not really a difference
all right apparently chris rock is uh
selling tons of tickets to his uh
stand-up show
so he's coming out way ahead
um
so now we have the weird situation where
unless this was fake news and i worry
that it was because i saw somebody else
say that he didn't make any statement
about it but i saw a statement that
chris rock said
in which he apologized
that happened or was that fake news did
i get taken by fake news
i think he apologized right
somebody says it's fake
oh really
oh it's a fake
oh wow
huh okay
the fake news was very good
it was a well-written fake
so
uh but at least at least i i could smell
it a little bit enough to ask the
question
all right
wow okay
anyway chris rock is coming out ahead
because he's selling a lot of tickets
and i think people appreciated that he
didn't
get violent and he didn't freak out and
he went on with the show and you know
and even if you think he shouldn't have
said what he said
uh you're not really going to come on
down too hard on a comedian being a
comedian especially i think there was
evidence he didn't know about the
alopecia which was perfectly believable
so no it wasn't a staged little flap i'm
sure that so chris rock comes out ahead
how about um
jada pinkett smith
did she command a head
i'd say yes
because do you think the women hate it
when men uh
defend them like that
they don't hate it
nope nope
they might say they do
but they don't hate it and i'd be
surprised if she hates it so i think she
came out ahead
you know on an interpersonal level
how about did she command a head in any
other
way
i would say yes
because she's very um
she's been classy about
not commenting about except i think she
did one meme she posted about
being here for the healing or something
so basically just no comment except one
positive one about healing i guess
good
i think she also brought the message
about what prophecy is
and more importantly
more importantly
how
how emotionally disturbing it is for the
person with it it would be real easy for
you to say well
of all the problems that's not the big
one and by the way she's rich and
beautiful
and didn't she shave her head because
she wanted to anyway i don't think so i
think probably it was always alopecia
just to guess
but
you know i think she came ahead
am i wrong
i think she looks good i think
a message that she'd like you to
understand which is people suffering
from this probably have
more of a suffering
than you would imagine
i think she looks good how about will
smith
he got an oscar he got a standing
ovation
he apologized
now that's not fake right
that will smith apologized for the hit
i think he did
and
i i feel as if um it won't affect his
movies
i don't think so
i feel like everybody came out ahead the
academy award got better
ratings the media got clicks i had
something to talk about you were
entertained
is this the weirdest situation in the
world literally everybody came out ahead
i'm not wrong about that right
i mean
you know chris rock suffered one slap
and then sold four times as many tickets
and got rich
and and he's
more relevant than he's ever been and i
don't know
it looks like he came out ahead
some people say they lost respect for
will smith but here's the thing with
celebrity
it matters more
that you made people like you then you
made people dislike you
because the people who are sort of
willing to dislike him in other words
they were you know
probably lukewarm on him in the first
place
they weren't going to buy his tickets
and go to his movies the people who
already liked him
probably like him a little bit more and
more likely to buy a ticket if i had to
bet
i don't know it'll hurt his
box office appeal at all i don't think
he will
he might lose some but then gain some
hard to say
well putin has apparently refocused his
uh army on the east
uh and people say
is this a change in strategy or a sign
he is losing what do you think
why is putin refocusing away from
capturing kiev and focusing on the east
where he's already
got control so he's going to consolidate
control why would he do that
is it because he's losing or is it just
good strategy
and it was his plan all along
well i would guess that
whatever his plan all along was it got
some modifications
but it might be that they can just
ignore a cave until everything else is
settled and then go back
or
or maybe they don't want to keep
incurring losses around kiev if that's
where they're the most losses so maybe
he's just cutting his losses during the
time he's negotiating
so it doesn't look like he's losing i
think it looks like he's winning
ah we don't know basically
that's the bottom line
but i'll tell you what the big problem
here is in order to make peace
doesn't one side need to think it's
losing
there might be exceptions to that but
generally speaking
you don't really get peace until one
side thinks it is losing or will lose
right
and the problem is they both think
they're winning
so putin i think he can make a very
strong case that he's winning or will
win
even though it will cost a lot
i think he make it the case he's winning
and i think that ukraine is already
making the case through their propaganda
that they're winning so ukraine can't
say
hey we're totally winning this thing but
we'll give you lots of things for peace
so ukraine has to make an offer in the
peace deal that reflects their
propaganda
and so they did
their propaganda says we're totally
winning this thing
and so they made an offer that you
wouldn't have made unless you thought
you were going to win the thing
and of course putin thinks he's winning
so he's not going to accept an offer
that suggests the other side of winning
that's not going to happen
so how could you possibly have peace
the only way you could have peace is
somebody has got to lose
or be in the direction to lose or looks
like it's going to happen any moment
now i heard a term that i had not heard
before
which is
what is it called
it's about when an army is getting ready
to collapse
oh a culminating point
so this is a michael ryan formerly
former deputy assistant secretary of
defense for european and nato policy
so he thinks he speculates and i don't
think this is a widespread opinion yet
but he speculates that the russian army
might be reaching a culminating point
now
as i understand it
the idiot explanation of that is
you have enough food until you don't
and you have enough ammunition
until you don't
and the don't part can happen suddenly
and then everything falls apart
right
because because if you're if you're
looking at how much ammunition you have
and it's just enough to escape it's not
enough to attack what the hell are you
going to do
if you don't know there's more coming
all you have is this much ammunition and
you think well i could probably do it to
cover my escape
but i don't think it's going to help me
attack anything and it doesn't look like
it's going to change you would instantly
go from offense to defense right
same with food
if you have food
you keep fighting
if it's the first day they tell you
there's no food you say wait a minute
did i hear that right
today is a no food day
when does the food come back
like well we don't know they keep
attacking our food trucks
it's a culminating point i think if i'm
interpreting right so the the russian
army at least in pockets might be
approaching
um
a complete disintegration point
but if it happens it would happen
quickly
somebody says the viet cong eight rap me
yeah it's it's hard to uh
completely understand
what people will do to survive so i
suppose they would just start
you know raping the ukrainian
countryside
but even that would be the army falling
apart because even to rape and pillage
they'd probably disperse
so
what do you think
if you had to guess
is any significant part of the russian
military force
near a culmination point
well
i'm guessing now
if if if near means in the next month
i'd say no
and if it takes longer than that then
russia russia will just find new ways to
get supplies i suppose
so
it looks like it looks like there's
something about this situation where
everybody can resupply but if you can't
resupply quickly or well
maybe you can keep limping along to do a
peace deal without without getting your
reaching your culmination point
so here's a story i read in one
publication
uh
i forget which one i think it was a
british publication
um that one of the reasons that ukraine
is doing such a good job is
of defense
is drones
but not the big ones not not the kind
that come from turkey and they look like
a big rocket i'm talking about the
little ones that you might have at home
so apparently there was some effort in
ukraine
that was fairly advanced
to sort of self-organize all the people
who knew about drones military or
non-military didn't matter and they
formed some kind of a
quasi-drone air force of small drones
and they you know they're cobbled
together in various ways and different
models and
and
part of the story said they were having
trouble getting parts because of
you know things are banned in certain
countries to which i thought that
doesn't make sense because nato would
just give them the parts
i mean if it's a military thing
i i can't imagine that those
that those uh restrictions would you
know be permanent
if we wanted to arm ukraine we could
certainly get them some hobby drone
parts i think
but the story goes
that that little unit
with the well-trained people that were
part of it would go out on some kind of
four-wheeled vehicles at night
they'd have their night vision small
drones spotting stuff
and they would blow up the most
strategic things
so they they blow up with whoever is in
front
and then once they slow things down
they'd look to pick off you know kernels
and you know officers and
i know supply trucks and stuff that sort
of thing so if you can pick and choose
after you slow them down
you basically can just stop a whole
convoy and it looks like to some extent
maybe they did now remember
every story that comes out of this
region
has to be suspect it's all propaganda
fog or
but
it's what i was expecting to hear
so remember
i'll tell you this too many times you'll
be sick of it i think i was the only
person i know of
there had to be more
but only what i heard saying that the
ukrainians would be unusually effective
because of new technology that we had
not seen employed before
this is that now if this is true that's
a big f
this would be a clear case of uh smaller
drones
being deployed in a way
that had never been used this
effectively before yes small drones have
been used for a long time but not like
this
so it's it's more about the way they're
using it and effectively
building a drone air force attack unit
to you know strategically attack things
now here's here's the thing
that i found fascinating
um
you wondered how the small drones could
get through
because of course russia would have
jamming stuff to be able to jam the
signal right but apparently the strategy
is they wait for the russians to launch
their own drones
because apparently you can't really have
a convoy in 2022 without your own drones
and you would you would kill your own
drones if you
send out some kind of suppressing signal
so the ukrainians would wait for the
suppressing signal to be turned off
which means the russians are launching
their own drones which means you can
launch your drones
so they've got this whole you know drone
electronic you know
battle going on that
is uh
and i'll say again
i don't know if we're really reading the
actual tactics of a thing happening or
is total
it could be like the ghost of kiev and
all the rest it could be
complete
but it sure sounds right
sounds good
all
right
um ukraine allegedly and here's another
maybe fake news story uh
allegedly
fired some artillery into russian
territory
and at least one report and i don't
think any of this is confirmed or even
reliable it may have been a like a
weapons depot or ammunition depot or
something like that
um but here's my question
why is ukraine waiting so long to attack
russia
who
who made the rule
that only russia can attack inside
ukraine
by ukraine's military which must have
some some capability
why can't they attack russia
i've never really understood that
is it because putin will get mad
i mean
he acts like he's kind of mad right now
a little bit
somebody says no ability but that seems
so unlikely are you telling me that they
can't even get a terrorist attack into
moscow not recommending it
not recommending it i don't recommend
violence but i'm wondering about the
strategy
because if the problem is that the
russian citizens are not getting the
message of what's happening over there
how do you send the message
that's how i'd send it if i were an
unscrupulous leader
and didn't care about
casualties
i would start blowing stuff up in moscow
anyway i could through individual agents
you know because
i got to be honest
you don't have to blow up things like
the twin towers with spectacular attacks
i'm pretty sure and i don't want to get
into details and you shouldn't either
but with no exaggeration whatsoever
i'm pretty sure i could take out a city
by myself
am i wrong
it wouldn't be that hard i don't think
i think i actually could now i'm not
going to tell you how i would do it it
wouldn't be straightforward
but
yeah
i mean
yeah it's doable right
i don't want to give you ideas but all i
want all i want you to do those of you
who say it can't be done
just look at the comments from the
people saying yes the people saying yes
have already figured out how to do it
the people the people saying no it's
just that you haven't figured out how to
do it
and
i've never understood why the islamic um
you know the
the terrorists who are the
extremists
i've never understood why they only do
attacks one way because it's so limiting
when they could just take out a whole
city pretty easily nobody does it i
don't know why
all right well don't get your ideas for
me but i don't understand why ukraine
isn't doing it there must be some
strategy behind that
and um
here's some
disney fake news
i've been ignoring this whole florida
don't say gay bill because it's not
really don't say gay it's so i guess the
bill in florida
that schools will not be allowed to
teach
anything about sexuality to kids below a
certain age
is that true
did i did i summarize that correctly
because i'm not really following the
story but that's basically it okay
people saying yes to that
so
and that seems fairly reasonable right i
i can see how most parents would say no
leave that to us
you know at least up to a certain age
um you know if if you're teaching a 14
year old
about birth control
then you have my attention right that
maybe you can make the argument and i'm
not going to make an argument pro or con
here i don't want to get into it but you
can make the argument that the school
would be a good way to capture that
because parents are don't do a good job
at it you can make an argument
but it's hard to make an argument that
the parents shouldn't be solely in
control of the the earliest impressions
for something of that
importance
but here's what i'd like to say the um
the opponents of that
have turned it into a don't say gay
meme basically so they're characterizing
the don't teach our kids anything about
sexuality
they're characterizing that as oh you're
not allowed to say gay
which of course
is total misrepresentation
but
as a misrepresentation
it's really good
so persuasion wise
really good well i mean let's just look
at this first of all it's got to say and
get in
when you what happens when you put a
rhyme in something
if the glove doesn't fit you must have
quit we've talked about this many times
if it's fast and sticky and it rhymes
in california they had a thing about
putting on your seatbelt
and it was a
click it or ticket
click it or ticket
these are all good so yes don't say gay
looks like professional work to me
it could be accidental and then it
caught on could be
but it looks
it looks professional
because it's got technique built into it
a little bit more than you normally see
from something that occurs naturally so
i'd say somebody who's got some skills
came up with that and i'd say that it
probably works
now there was a video i saw on twitter
in which a disney public uh
disney official of some kind was saying
that they're striving to make 50 of the
characters in in disney content
to be uh either
lgbtqia
and i i don't even know what the ia is
anymore
uh and racial minorities
so that between the two categories they
laid like
50 percent of their characters and of
course
people were
outraged people were outraged
because they said
you were so woke
why disney why
must you force
you know 50
of your people in your movies to be
racial minorities and lgbtq why
well i'll offer a reason
it could be that that's exactly what the
country is
could it be
that what disney said is yeah we want
our movies to reflect roughly what the
country is
which is
that
that's what the country is
here are the actual numbers
58 of the country is white
so remember she said 50 would be
minorities but 58 are white so you'd say
oh that that's a little high
no
because she said
minorities and
lgbtq
how what percentage of the population of
any population let's say the white
population is eligi is also
lgbtqia
and it's about
six percent
so if you start with your 58
are white in america
and then you're not counting six percent
of them as being lgbtqia you get about
52
are white and
straight if if that's even the word
anymore
and and disney just said that's what
we're going to make our content just
like the people
now
how many of you were offended when you
heard they were going to make
their content just like the public
probably some of you
am i right
just because nobody did the math and
when you first hear it you're like whoa
what are they doing that seems like too
high and i think there's there's a known
phenomenon where people are bad at
estimating
you know what percentage of things there
are in the country that's a known thing
right
this is one of those i and i i cheekily
tweeted about this
and i said that in related news
40 of all sick days in the workplace are
on a monday or friday 40 can you believe
that
that's an outrageous number
40 of all the people calling in sick are
doing that coincidentally
on a friday or a monday huh how about
that
oh wait
monday plus friday
would be two end of the five work days
which is exactly forty percent
that's right now i actually did a
dilbert comic about that
all right so
um
here's a story about uh
alex epstein author
he's got a book coming out called
the moral case for fossil fuels
and apparently there was going to be a
washington post article he was warned
about that was going to try to cancel
him and and paint him as a racist
because he thinks there's a moral reason
for or
apparently he argues in the book i
haven't yet read but plan to
that there's a moral case for fossil
fuels now i think you've all heard the
argument
i would assume that you're going to get
lots of you know good meat on this but
you've heard other people have made the
argument that
fossil fuels are better for
the poor than they are for anybody i
guess it's supposedly good for every
everybody but the poor especially needed
to survive
because they need energy if you can't
get it another way you're gonna have to
get it that way
now here's the thing
do you believe
that there's a real thing
where the media colludes
or maybe even just one media entity to
write a hit piece
to take out the reputation of somebody
who has a book
that goes against the narrative do you
believe that's real
it's very real
okay you're all saying yes i wasn't sure
if you were all convinced no it's very
real
um bloomberg one of the bloomberg
publications
uh did this to me
when i was saying good things about
trump when he's starting to get traction
so
that you could see people getting picked
off one by one
and
i survived now i told you earlier that i
googled myself and i was trying to see
if that bloomberg piece was still the
top hit
because for years
four years
one of the i or you would see the top or
one of the top news hits was a hippies
because it was a big publication and it
was recent
so it's there at the top now it's gone
away and i wonder if it ever deserves to
be there
because it went away
i don't know there weren't that many new
things
that there were like major news pieces
to replace it but it went away
so these are the things that i wonder
about um i understand that the
the book by
robert f kennedy the real anthony fauci
he was also subject to the media
colluding to
basically ignore that book i think he
had no
no book reviews but sold a million books
how do you sell a million books and not
get a book review
from one of the major publications
it's collusion of some kind
all right so i would recommend to you
alex epstein's book it's coming out in
may i guess
called the moral case for fossil fuels
and like i said i haven't read it
but
but obviously people have seen advanced
copies
there's definitely an effort to make
sure that whatever is in that book
does not be is not seen as credible
so you should ask yourself why
would they try to kill a book before it
even comes out
and the best reason to do it
is that it's true
that's the best reason
so i'm thinking that there's some good
stuff in there that somebody really
wants to die
um all right
all right uh that ladies and gentlemen
is just about everything i want to say
and
i think you'll agree
that this has been a peak experience for
most of you for some of you the very
best thing that will happen today for
some of you others
it will just be the beginning of an
amazing day
uh no i cannot send your book
that you send to me do you know it's
embarrassing when people ask me to fill
out a forum and i tell them i can't
i'm disabled
i tell you that my drawing hand has a
focal dystonia which means there's
literally nothing wrong with my hand and
i'm still disabled because the only
thing i can't do is right with the pen
it's the only thing i can't do
i mean i could you know juggle i've
played the drums i could play any
instrument the hand is perfect
there's nothing wrong with it physically
there's a there's a little mental glitch
that happened because i overused it and
then the brain said you can't do that
anymore and that won't let me so i can't
my hand won't work would i put a pen in
it and put it to paper it just freezes
so so i draw left-handed but i've never
taken the time to
learn to write
left-handed quickly enough that i could
fill in a form i mean if i took forever
i could
it's called a focal
focal dystonia
it's related to the voice problem i had
they often travel in pairs
but
thankfully they don't
thankfully they usually don't go in more
than pairs so i'll probably i'm probably
two and done in all likelihood
all right
um
let me see what's going on here
and um
and i will talk to you soon
thank you very much everybody
have a good day
