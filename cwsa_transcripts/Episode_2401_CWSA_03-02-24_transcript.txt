good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization some
call it coffee with Scott adens because
that's his name and if you'd like to
take it up to a level of enjoyment that
only the weekend could understand and I
don't mean the singer well for that all
you need is a cup or muger glass a
tankered shell forstein a canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dope imediate of the day thing makes
everything better is called the
simultaneous siing happens now
go oh wow that was extra good
today I don't know
why well there's a story in the
telegraph that suggests that Prehistoric
Women were probably better at hunting
than men
shall we just stop
there that's right yeah because one of
the things we really know a lot about is
prehistoric people and we certainly know
that those women were probably better
Hunters than men you know if you asked
me what kind of skills it would require
to be a hunter back in prehistoric times
I would have said
strength strength would be right up
there near the top I would said I would
have said athletic ability the ability
to run long distances carry carry your
prey back throw a spear far far and hard
uh but most most importantly I would
think that one of the greatest skills of
hunting would be the ability to sit
quietly for long periods of
time all right so
the
I'm sorry that was just for
me you you could feel free to enjoy it
too but that was just for
me all right the funniest part about
this was the comment section so I looked
at in the comments one of the first
comments is from uh somebody who you
might not recognize by this name John
Kavanaugh has anybody recognize that
name John
Kavanaugh now you might not recognize it
but if I said the other name he goes by
let's see if you recognize it coach
Kavanaugh do you recognize him now coach
Kavanaugh he he traded Conor
McGregor he's one of the mo he's one
probably the most famous MMA fighter
coach and he he just puts a little meme
there of of some actress whose name I
can't remember just like
she
I like the fact that we don't have to
take any of this seriously
anymore do we do it do we have to keep
pretending that women could do
everything men can do in general now
certainly if you talk about any
individual yes women can do almost every
single thing that men can do except draw
Comics no I'm kidding they can do that
too um not as well but no stop it stop
it you're going to get me in trouble in
your
comments no no it's just joking we're
just kidding there's a new study that
says that people who sleep less than six
hours a night have a higher all cause
mortality oh oh that's bad because that
would be
me oh but there's there's a second part
the second part is uh only if they don't
exercise apparently if you
exercise um it cancels out the lack of
sleep
do you believe
that let me tell you how to read this
science so one of my jobs here is I
teach you how to interpret scientific
studies so you know which ones are
credible and which ones not to believe
and there's one rule that I hold more
dear than all the other rules and it's
this if the scientific study agrees with
what you want it to
say you should embrace it
fully
I don't know if this is true if it's
true it would be you know sort of an
exception because most of this kind of
science is not but I like it because I
sleep less than six hours a night and I
exercise so sounds good to
me what do you say do we all accept this
one let's not look into it too closely I
don't want to find out that it wasn't a
randomized control trial if you know
what I mean observational good enough
meta study f fine as long as it agrees
with
me well here's something in the category
of nothing to worry about
here that will be one of my categories I
think that'll be a new segment I'll do a
regular recurring segment nothing to
worry about here and the story under
that category is uh apparently China has
some kind of national uh directive to
erase all covid data from the entire
Health Care
system
everything about
vaccinations about all the
studies yep it's probably exactly what
you think it is I don't think it's to
save uh I don't think it's to save room
on their
computers let's just say it's probably M
it's probably not a data storage
problem yep that's probably exactly what
it looks
like well one of my better predictions
and um boy do I have some good
predictions lately but one of my better
ones was that uh the age of apps on
phones would come to an end and that The
Logical future interface would be that
the phone adapts to whatever you're
trying to do without you first telling
it what you're going to do choosing an
app and then doing it which destroys
your flow I want to just start using
just talk to talk to it so so the
example that I always gave was uh let's
say you just start send writing a
message so you just got of blank screen
every every time you open your phone
it's just a blank screen so you could
talk to it or you could type to it and
then it figures out what you must want
and then figures out how to do it now ai
can do that pretty well so instead of uh
calling up let's say a text message app
you just start sending a message you
know Bob
uh can you do this or that and then your
phone quite reasonably thinks huh it's a
message um there's several ways I could
send it and then when you're ready to
send it and only then it gives you the
options of which mechanisms to send it
by do I send it by WhatsApp or email so
the the technology should be the last
thing you do not the first because it
ruins your flow and apparently there's a
whole bunch of companies that are
working on just exactly that devices
that don't have a traditional interface
or an app you just sort of talk to it
and the AI figures out what to
do so I'll take a win on that uh there's
news that uh that ex baseball star Steve
Garvey who's running against Adam Schiff
for the senate in California he's
actually up in the polls so he's got 27%
compared to 25 but I think that's a fake
out right this fake news CU I need a
fact check on this in this is I think
it's only telling us that Steve Garvey
is the only conservative in the race and
Schiff is running against several people
who are
taking some of his votes away but in the
end in the end isn't it uh just the two
of them or am I wrong that the final
vote will just be between two people or
no is like jungle rules or something
because if it comes down to just Steve
Garvey in California a conservative
against any Democrat doesn't he get
slaughtered I think he's only I think
he's doing the Trump thing where he's or
the Fox News thing where Fox News always
has eyes ratings because there's only
one Fox News but there's a bunch of
other liberal
places I think that's all that's
happening right so his actual chance of
winning in California is still
vanishingly small isn't it because if he
won if he won in California that would
be quite a story I just can't believe it
could happen yeah there's a runoff and
then and then it just goes Democrat like
usual
right some I'm seeing in the comments uh
garvey's best hope is to reach the
general election and lose 6040 I think
that's
right all right uh over in Arizona uh
Republicans are trying to get a bill
passed that would allow land owners to
shoot migrants on their
property now I'm laughing because
there's no chance I don't think there's
any chance that gets passed is there is
there any chance I would get pass now I
think they would have to you know
demonstrate that there was some danger
or something I don't I don't think you
can just you know start mowing them down
even if they pass this law which I don't
think they will even if they did I I
don't think you could shoot them just
for you know wandering across the corner
of your property so I don't know how
this would actually be implemented or
how you could keep people out of jail
and keep people from you know being
murdered
unnecessarily but there's a bigger
question here there's a bigger question
the bigger issue is what does the
federal government think about their
border policy when one of the states on
the border is considering letting their
citizens open fire on the
migrants that's the story the story that
this is being taken
seriously that people are actually
saying you know maybe we should just
start shooting them which I don't
recommend by the way bad idea but the
fact that this is actually being
discussed There's an actual bill there's
legislation is is going forward now
again it's just mind-boggling that we're
in this place let me let me tie in
another unrelated topic
squatters so we have a massive problem
with squatters because I guess the law
is favorable to squatters so somebody
gets in your house you know you go away
from the weekend they could just move
in and you can't get them out legally
because you can't there's no Force you
can use and the government won't help
you you know you just get into a long
legal process that doesn't help much so
I got a feeling that uh men with guns
are going to start changing the
equation I'm not recommending it I'm
predicting it bad idea to take law into
your own hands don't do it very much
don't do it but I do know
men don't you have you ever met a man we
do have a limit there's a limit now each
of us have a different limit but we're
very close to the point where a lot of
people who own own guns are going to say
there it is that's my
limit you put a squatter in my house and
the government won't get him out that's
my
limit and I think people are just going
to start using Firearms to do what the
government won't do for
them now it hasn't happened yet I we
haven't seen anything like that but it
seems like the obvious predictable
outcome if if there's a continued
government against the people's
situation which is what it looks like it
looks like the government is against the
people of the United States at this
point that's what it feels like
and reasonably given how well armed we
are um some sub some segment of
Americans uh tragically are going to say
okay this is why they gave us a second
amendment so there's a reason I have
this
gun I I hate to see it happen but we're
definitely heading in the place where if
the government doesn't do the job for
for the people the people are going to
start
shooting and I'm probably not going to
talk them out of it but it's a bad
idea all
right so I saw a document today thank
you
Owen um that I didn't understand but
there is a very poorly written article
about uh Australia and
censorship and apparently Australia is
worried about
me destroying the
world does that sound like an
exaggeration the the government of
Australia is worried about me personally
just me not not me as an example of
other people but actually me and and
that I could be an existential threat to
not just Australia but the entire
world do you believe
that apparently is true I found out this
morning so uh there's a longer document
that I posted and it was so poorly
written that I ran it through two
different AIS grock and open AI to ask
it to summarize it what it was saying
about me because I couldn't tell it was
so poorly written I mean it was really
poorly written super poorly written like
I've never seen anything like it it's
it's actually a Wonder of of Badness in
writing but here's one part of it and I
again I'd like to put this in context
but I don't understand the rest of the
document so something was happening over
there with their government and
censorship and specifically censorship
around
climate and they called out two people
in particular as their people that they
want to mention as their most dangerous
voices that they considered critics of
climate change and here's what they said
a cop26 paper and again I don't know
what what that is some kind of
government censorship related thing I
guess
um called deny deceive delay which
theem some group in Australia uh
submission also cited with approval okay
I can't even read this freaking thing I
was going to read you one paragraph but
I swear it looks like it was written by
a a drunk guy or something who knew a
lot of words I'll just read the part
with me in
it there are political right-wing top
influencers as part of a
conspiratorial quote intellectual dark
web now it's coming to my name this is
how they're describing me political
right-wing top influencer as part of a
conspiratorial intellectual dark web its
alleged members uhoh here comes the
alleged
members of the intellectual dark web
include bestell in psychologist Dr
Jordan Peterson and humorous Scott Adams
and his Dilbert
cartoons the
paper uh it was agreed by blah blah blah
blah
now do you know how weird it is to be me
sometimes let me just
describe like an ordinary day for me
I'll just be sitting here with my phone
just like you and I I'll think hey I
I've got a clever thing to say about
climate change that might help people
understand the larger context and I'll
say put a little post here and the
xplatform boom hey good I got you I got
100,000 views good and then I go on with
my
day then over in
Australia somebody's like my God he's
trying to destroy the entire planet if
if he makes people panic less about
climate change um um um it's going to
get hot Australia will probably fry
first because it's kind of warm down
there anyway and and then Australia will
fry and maybe the entire world and we've
got to stop that
cartoonist isn't that weird I'm just
sitting here with my opinion and
apparently the nation of Australia is
worried about
me do I have that much influence
you tell
me does Australia need to be afraid of
me because I'm so
influential you say yes you think they
need to be afraid of me because I'm so
influential do you think I could do you
think that I can
influence the climate change issue
worldwide how many of you think that I
can influence personally just me right
and and Jordan Peterson of course but do
you think that I personally can change
the world's policies on climate
change why are you say
yes you think that I personally just me
just talking into my microphone and
posting on a that I can change the
world's climate change
policies well you're right I can they
should be afraid of me so
Australia don't come at me let me let
let me say this if there's you know the
Australian government is
listening you know I'm on your side
right did anybody tell you I'm on your
side
Australia maybe maybe you Australians
need to talk among yourselves at the
government
level maybe work this out I'm on your
side very much
completely I I'm Pro Australia I want
you guys to do really well I want you
not to waste your money on things that
won't help I want you to thrive spend
money on things that will help I want
you to be a strong Ally of the United
States so maybe targeting me for
Destruction is a pretty stupid
thing to do and yes I can influence
climate change globally and I don't care
if you believe
it
and I don't know why anybody would think
I would have so much
influence next story about a month ago I
was posting that uh we don't understand
any of our complicated legislation it
really help uh help the public if AI
could be used to summarize
legislation wouldn't that be great just
run these big complicated omnius things
through the AI and have it just tell you
in clear language okay it's trying to do
this and this and
this said that a month ago anyway I
think it was yesterday that Elon mus
said uh that very soon grock the AI will
summarize
legislation so that's why Australia is
afraid of me um I also suggested the
other day that we should use Gro or AI
in general to create what I'd call an
influence chart of who's who's married
to who who dated who who worked for who
uh who who clerked for what judge uh who
was a roommate with who because it turns
out that the only thing that matters in
our news stories is who was
involved uh I'll say this a million
times until it just becomes your
operating system if the only thing you
know is what happened in the news which
is what the news tells you and you don't
know the connections between not not
just the central person in the news
because they usually do tell you that
but how that person is connected to
other people in the world if you don't
know the connection to the other people
there's nothing in the story that's real
it's just completely fake news at that
point right yeah you got to know the
people now I don't know if it's possible
but it does seem to me that every time
there's let's say a trump court case
somehow we always figure out that
somebody knew somebody who was sleeping
with somebody clerk for somebody I don't
know where that comes from from but it
must come from public records if if you
did nothing but check the LinkedIn
profile of everybody involved in
anything you'd have 20% of the
connections and then there's other
things I would imagine you could find
out who's married married through public
records is that something that AI could
do figure out who's married just from
public
records sometimes you could figure out
who's a roommate you know the the
college roommate thing is really strong
I can't imagine being a college roommate
with somebody and then you know not
having a strong connection to them and
wanting to protect them a little
bit so I would love to see that I don't
know if it's possible but we'll
see
um is it my imagination or have
Democrats completely surrendered on
policy because here's what I
see um I see that they've completely
given up and the the only thing you can
do if you don't have any policy
arguments is what they're doing end free
speech and then tell you that uh that
Trump guy is a Putin loving
grabbing monster and he's coming for you
and probably a white supremacist
too have you noticed
that the entire Democrat approach say
they sent out Jill to say that Trump bad
for women
so that's actually their their entire
campaign is that now let's compare
campaigns Trump Campaign theme um I
think you would agree it's something
like you know make America great again
and everybody understands that he means
something like the first term and secure
the
border so securing the border is pretty
specific we know what that would look
like and I don't think Trump has the
same obligation for policy
descriptions because you know he would
do what he did before for example you
know he doesn't like regulations he
would cut two for every one he approves
presumably he would just keep doing the
same things he was doing because he was
happy with what he was doing and his and
his supporters were happy with it so I
assume he would promote American Energy
Right promote American energy production
um and that would help us with our GDP
and maybe it's the only way out of the
debt situation you're going to have to
outgrow it if you can't spend it if you
can't pay it
down
um so that's that's Trump secure the
Border get rid of excess policies keep
taxes
low you know don't get into any
wars pretty good policy stuff and he
doesn't really like I said I don't
really think he has to say it he's the
only person ever ran for president who
doesn't really have to get too specific
because we saw it it's a huge advantage
that he had four years you just say well
do you want this or whatever what other
what else is being
offered now here are the
campaigns Trump secure the border and
make America great again Biden there
might be a Putin loving grabbing a
monster under your bad who could be also
a white
prist how does nobody notice
that the media is so so biased that you
don't notice that only one of the
candidates is even running on anything
like
policies and then
furthermore when when Trump goes
personal after Biden he's going after
his age and infirmity which we all
see right that's very different even the
Democrats see is too old poll the polls
are very clear about that so when he
says uh Biden's too old that's just
objectively something most reasonable
people can
see but when Biden
says uh you know all this Putin loving
 grabbing white supremacy stuff is
going to be the existential problem to
the
country what happened during the first
four years that would suggest any of
that you know it wouldn't be so
ridiculous if he said well he did say
all these things before the first time
Trump was
president but now that you've seen four
years of what he does
how in the world would any of these
things bother you as as like a real
legitimate worry anyway you have to you
have to completely get rid of free
speech and own the media to win a
campaign if you're not even trying to
talk about policies because you know
that if you did you would
lose that's where we're at and mo the
most important seems to
be and I would say really Central to
winning for the Democrats is to scare
black voters
and and so if you said what are the two
campaigns doing in terms of getting
black votes you'd say well Trump is
saying that you know he did some good
things and you know black home ownership
went up and some other
stuff so he's saying I'll do some good
things that's good for everybody and has
been you know seem to be good for black
Americans because they're just part of
Americans and the Biden campaign is is
there's a white supremacist who's coming
to take away everything you
have so scaring black people is really
the central thing that the Democrats
have to do I would say more than any
other thing they have to frighten black
voters would you agree now I think
that's very
mockable I think somebody like
V could say you realize that all your
team is offering is frightening black
voters that's their entire campaign
we're going to say that this guy so bad
and he's extra bad for black voters and
we're going to hope that you believe it
because we own the
media probably
work
anyway um and and the way the
media is trying to spin um Trump's
statement that because of all of his
legal problems he might um appeal to
Black voters the way they're spitting
that is they're saying that he's
claiming that being a criminal would
make him popular with black
people that's not the
point that would be super racist I don't
know anybody was thinking of it that way
on the Republican side here's the way
they're thinking of it being unfairly
Accused by the justice system is
something they can definitely relate to
I would imagine I mean I'm not black but
you know based on what I hear if they
have an issue about the justice system
being biased and then they can observe
it being biased on Trump's case I would
think that that boosts their own
argument that the justice system is not
blind which I think is an important
argument for Black America that they
would like us to know that you know it's
not the same
situation you could argue the actual
stats but how people feel about it is
unfairly abused by the system versus
unfairly abused by the system and then
the Democrats because
they're I I won't complete that sentence
the Democrats turned that into he's such
a big racist that he thinks if he's a
felon that black people will like him
more because he thinks they must be
felons or something it's disgusting it's
disgusting that they would you know try
to try to turn it into that but it's
working there are two MSNBC guests
couple of uh creepy looking white guys
uh wrote a book says that white rural
white rural voters are the biggest
threat to American
democracy yeah all those uh White rural
voters who have been marching in the
streets I mean you can barely go outside
with without running into a white rural
voter who is doing a protest in the
streets and when I go to uh if I go
shopping I'll notice that all the
shelves are empty because a white rural
voter robbed everything in the store and
you know what is really really
frightening if you ever find yourself in
a white rural area well I hope you're
wearing body
armor cuz they're all murderers
they're all murderous you get anywhere
near them they start shooting those
white rural
voters yeah you got to worry about them
they're trying to steal all your money
take away your free speech oh wait no
that's the government sorry they're
trying to start some more no that's the
government again starting Wars well but
at least they're trying to overt no okay
that's the government again but at least
we do know those white rural voters
they're trying to round up citizens cens
who did nothing but protest and put them
in no that's the government
again well the one thing we know about
these white rural voters is if there's
even one little virus that ever comes
out again they're going to want to lock
down society and no that's the
government
again well the huge crime rate no that's
not
that so yeah
I don't know what to think about it um
but I have another
question what's your best theory of what
happened to Morning Joe and
M what what the hell happened to
them I'm actually curious about it so
it's not even a it's not even a
political point I'm actually genuinely
curious so I have some theories now one
is TDS you know Trump derangement
syndrome but I don't know
I don't know if that explains it they
act like they're paid intelligence
assets don't they they they act
like um going after Trump is their job
and not just their job being on TV but
maybe like an extra job if you know what
I mean maybe like their side job
unspecified if you know what I
mean they look and act exactly like
they're either CIA or I don't know
Chinese assets I don't think they're
Chinese assets but they don't act
like normal people there's something
wrong I don't know what it is
now I'm going to generously rule out the
option that the two of them are insanely
stupid because they act insanely stupid
only only involving Trump and and I
don't think that there's any such thing
as somebody who's Smart in general
because they both seem very smart
general you know Su successful
professionals
Etc I don't think there's any such thing
as being smart about everything except
Trump you know unless you've got TDS
Trump derangement
syndrome um so I don't think they're
stupid and I'm having trouble believing
that it's just
TDS because they're just so committed to
the weirdness of it it looks like
they're paid so I'm going to say again
that every time you see something that
doesn't make sense to you and nobody can
explain it in any way that makes sense
it's probably always the
CIA or some intelligence asset
situation so I don't know I'm just
saying that every time I see a mystery
and then it gets solved it always is the
same solution well it was really the
Spooks who were pushing the
program all right the Leticia James
campaign um apparently it's totally
legal to get a bunch of campaign funds
for your campaign and then spend it on
yourself for anything you want travel
trips food and so apparent the allegedly
Laticia James did that and spent over
$300,000 so far on what looked to be
personal expenses from her um campaign
funds now it's completely legal I guess
there's no problem with it and
but it's deeply
unethical because people gave the people
who donated the money to her certainly
were not expecting her to use it for
lunch would you agree they weren't
expecting that it's legal I guess it's
unrestricted
but certainly unethical and you know
given that she's in the situation of
going after Trump the the dirtiness of
this is just look but but the question I
would ask is why is anybody donating to
a campaign in a safe apparently she's
very safe that's why she can spend her
campaign money she doesn't need it why
would you give money to her next time
shouldn't her campaign funding drop to
something like zero shouldn't somebody
run against her and say well you could
donate to me and I'll use it to win this
race or you can donate to the other side
and she'll use it for a trip
to
a luxury destination which actually is
literally what she use some of the money
for how do you lose that campaign donate
to me and I'll do a good job donate to
my competitor she'll go to a luxury
resort on your
money I don't know she's got a
problem all right um so getting back to
the Democrat strategy of scaring black
people it's a two-prong thing if you
scare black people they won't vote for
Republicans but more importantly if you
combine scaring black people with
getting Soros to fund a bunch of uh
female black
prosecutors the woman part matters too
because they're afraid he's going to
grab their
 and uh he's a white supremacist
they say so you put them in you so Soros
gets them all funded and and and they
become prosecutors and attorney generals
and whatnot and what would you expect
them to do if they had been brainwashed
into thinking that Trump was the devil
and he was going to rape them all and be
partners with Putin and become a way
supremacist
well I I have a
problem um believing that the black
female prosecutors and attorney generals
and whatnot that are going after Trump
are acting
unethically because it looks like it
right it looks like it's compl
completely unethical and that is you
know purely just lawfare but I feel like
that's missing the
story The this is Downstream from the
brainwashing stopping Hitler is what we
want people to
do let me say that
again stopping
Hitler even if they break the law is
what you want your fellow citizens to
do so if Trump were in fact
what the media had presented you know
existential threat to the entire solar
system yeah I want Leticia James to stop
him any way she can you I want uh who's
the other
one um I'm forgetting the
names but you
know yeah Alvin brag funny funny Willis
so I would like them to stop an
existential threat stop Hitler stop this
monster the the problem is that he's not
those
things and it's pretty obvious after
four years of him in office he's not
those things so I'm going to say that
you know we have to we have to do what
we can to make sure he doesn't go to
jail for lawfare but we need to stop the
brainwashing the brainwashing gets you
this soros's funding wouldn't make any
difference without the brainwashing
because I think they would my guess is
that when Leticia James wakes up and
fonny James or fonnie Wills when they
wake up in the morning I don't think
that they say let me go to work and go
do some racial stuff I doubt it they
probably go to work and say oh there's
some Crooks let's see what we can do
about reducing crime and I'll get paid
too I guess so I don't think it's about
being black I don't think it's about
being a woman except that Democrats have
specifically brainwashed that segment of
the society and then funded the them
into office to act as one would when
you're trying to save the world so these
are uh some victims of the brainwashing
and the Soros campaign I think they will
be completely destroyed and I don't
think there's any
choice so I've said that Republicans
need to destroy these prosecutors and
attorney generals uh and da they need to
destroy them their
careers because you can't have it happen
again but I think they're
victims as much as they're part of the
problem and I I think they got
brainwashed and I think they were put in
a position where they had to act a
little bit like this and maybe it was a
little bit an a character for some of
them so I'm going to say that
brainwashing is the bigger problem but
you're still going to have to destroy
their lives just so it doesn't happen
again um
so well at least we have free speech in
this
country um Blaze media investigated
reporter was just picked up by the FBI
for his January 6 reporting apparently
did nothing but reported things standing
around uh and of course he was putting
chains and per walked so that anybody
would be humiliated by the situation so
that if you were a reporter you would uh
certainly want to do whatever your
government said because you don't want
to be put in Chains and per block
but that's just one example all right so
you can't make yeah Steve Baker is the
name of the journalist we'll say his
name
um but I don't think youd make like some
Trend you know out a one situation might
be something special about it well well
both there's also the Trump lawfare
for uh his free speech on January
6 but really that would just be two
examples like don't make a whole big
thing about two examples because it's
sort of anecdotal it's not like free
speech is G in America or anything like
that well the January Sixers are in jail
for protesting which looks a lot like
free speech so I mean you could argue
that that's like thousands more
examples of a lack of Free
Speech but still I'm not sure that's
like some Global Trend or anything like
that well Ricky Vaughn is being put in
jail for a free speech on the internet
but again that that's sort of a special
case it's kind of a special case but at
least we have the media to you know they
have free speech well actually we found
out that the media is completely
captured by our intelligence people so
and the Democrats so we don't really
have free speech in the sense that the
media has free speech they pretty much
have to do what their masters tell them
to do but in but in so many other ways
we have free speech and but by what I
mean by free speech is that the only
place you have free speech is on the
xplatform unless you misuse somebody's
pronouns yeah because you can't do that
on the xplatform until until uh till
that gets fixed um but apparently Elon
said he would fix that um here's another
prediction I got right I said that Elon
would not be personally aware that the
xplatform had said it's hate speech if
you mis um identify somebody's
gender and sure enough apparently he
wasn't aware of
it and he said he would fix it right
said he'd fix
it um so that that that prediction was
just sort of a Dilbert prediction that
the CI the CEO is never involved in that
level of decision so it wasn't hard to
Guess that he didn't know that
happened um but so at least we've got
our free speech on X now because that's
coming back um well I mean you do I I
don't actually have free speech on the
xplatform but maybe you do in my case my
account seems to be so
siloed I don't know why it could be the
algorithm could be something else but I
don't reach anybody who disagrees with
me so it's not really free speech if the
only people you're you can technically
logically talk to or people who agree
with you it's not exactly free speech so
again I don't want to make a big thing
about the fact that they're per walking
and arresting an investigative reporter
just because he was doing his job and
nothing illegal and don't don't start
throwing in your Katherine Herod stuff
about how she's in trouble with the
courts we not reporting her Source
special case don't think about Trump
saying that you should protest
peacefully and they turned it into a
some kind of a hate crime in
Resurrection thing don't think about
those thousands of people who
are rotting in jail because they tried
to do their patriotic duty to express
their opinion that the election was not
as Fair as it should have been forget
about Ricky vaugh who said
something he thought was a joke and he's
in goddamn jail for it and forget about
the fact that your entire media is
captured because at least you can talk
to yourself on the
xplatform we still have
that
so yeah we don't have free speech nor do
we have a republic and that's not
hyperbole that is not
hyperbole you're no longer living in a
republic I don't know what's going on
but it does look like some
intelligence group of people are just
running the show and have been for a
while all right there's a uh a
metaanalysis what have I told you about
met meta
analysis the lowest one one of the worst
ways to know is true somebody looks at a
bunch of studies and says well all the
studies are bad but if we take the
average of them it might average out
their
mistakes maybe but I wouldn't call it
science usually your assumptions of
which ones go into study and which ones
are not good enough ends up giving you
the results so it's about your
assumptions it's not about the
study but an exception might be if the
meta analysis was only of
peer-reviewed double blind highest
quality tests now in that situation if
they're all high quality tests the
highest quality gold
standard well then looking at a meta
analysis that gets much more reasonable
I I wouldn't criticize that I would put
a little warning Flag by it but I
wouldn't say that's a big mistake it's
the non uh controlled studies you know
the observational studies that sort of
thing if you do a metaanalysis of those
I don't know that you'd know anything
but a meta analysis taking the average
of all the the best quality studies that
might mean something so that was done
recently on vitamin D and its impact on
covid and the result is that it's uh 60%
lower covid cases 68% reduction in ICU
Admissions and 4% reduction in
deaths
wow and um what's different about this
is it's not observational which is what
I've complained about I've complained
that they say hey the people who did the
best had the best uh who came out the
best had the best vitamin D levels and I
said that's not good enough because
that's after the fact like after the
person dies you check their vitamin D
that could tell you something but it
also could be just a
correlation the way you really want to
do it is you want to admit people to the
hospital and then uh boost their vitamin
D and then compare them to people who
admitted to the hospital you know with
similar conditions that didn't have
boosted didn't get boosted when they got
there that'd be a pretty good comparison
and apparently that's what they did they
did the right
comparison and found out that vitamin D
was basically a miracle drug and it
would be good if you already had it in
you but if you didn't and you got sick
apparently being boosted made a big
difference
now um I don't like to brag now that's a
lie I love to
brag
um I had by
far by
far the best predictions and opinions on
the pandemic no one no one came even
close well let me just give you a sample
I won't go through the whole list
because it's
long on day one of the pandemic I told
everybody to supplement with vitamin D
and get sun and lose
weight that was better than the advice
of every
doctor I also said that I didn't I
predicted that the vaccination would not
work now separately I ended up you know
bending to the pressure of wanting to go
on a foreign vacation with my lovely
wife at the time and got got the
shots so far I seem fine so I may have
gotten lucky
but by far it was the best prediction
and advice nobody came
close um and I won't go through the
other things I got right about the
pandemic but the funny thing is of
course uh I'm famous for being wrong
about the
pandemic if you went on the internet
you'd find out one of the most famously
wrong people it's because some idiots
reversed all my opinions and made it
into
memes that's how it goes so I'm famous
for the worst opinions but unambiguously
there's nobody who came close there's
nobody said it sooner or more right than
what I
said um and you can you can actually
overdo overdose on vitamin D somebody
died recently from too bunch that was in
the news as
well well who is The Angriest Man in the
world I don't
know but I'm going to say if it's not
Elon Musk I don't know why it isn't you
already know that the courts struck down
is what 56 billion pay package that the
board of the company he created had
approved he completely earned it and he
wouldn't have gotten much of anything
unless he'd met incredibly difficult
Target for the company which he met the
person who sued him had nine shares of
the stock just enough to have the cause
uh one because they used like they used
a court that just would hate hate
anybody who wasn't Democrat I guess or
backing the Democrats and so he loses in
a what is obviously a political decision
but
worse do you think it could worse than
losing $56 billion in court for what is
clearly a lawfare and um illegitimate
decision what could be worse than
that well let me tell you the lawyers
who uh pushed that case and denied him
$56 billion in compensation that he
absolutely
earned um they're demanding $6 billion
in lawyer fees in the form of Tesla
shares
can you take a moment with me to just
go
wow I don't know what's the worst thing
I've ever heard in my life you know that
didn't involve actual violence physical
violence this might be the worst thing
I've ever heard in my
life I can't even think of anything that
is more anti-civilization than this
except actual violence this is anti-
civilization I
mean let me be honest if I were the
richest man in in America and somebody
took $ 56 billion from me because they
could just because they could and then
then they demanded $6 billion from me
just because they could
just because they
could I would put in a hit on them I
would have them
murdered now I don't recommend it
because it's impossible to get away with
murder these days but if it were me I
would actually have them killed
literally I would have them killed now I
don't recommend it no
violence but if I were in that
situation I would never be able to sleep
until they were
dead they
they they may get lucky that they messed
with the only guy who wouldn't kill him
for
it I don't think that musk is a
murderer but I wouldn't say that about
every CEO would you do you think there
are any CEOs who have ever murdered
anybody of course there
are probably quite a
few yeah now I yeah lot of I know
who yeah I'm pretty sure that there are
let me let me put it this way do you
think that there are any uh
International companies that are
operating in you know say third world
countries where everything's you know
bribery and murder and danger you don't
think there's ever been a CEO of a Major
Oil Company who gave the order to kill
somebody and now they might have been
bad people they might have been uh maybe
they hired some mercenaries to kill some
people who were bothering their
operation around the oil
drilling but
honestly can you tell me you don't think
CEOs order the murder of people who were
bad enough that they deserve to be
murdered of course they do they they
just try to try to not get
caught now I don't think elon's that
kind of person and I definitely don't
recommend that he put any murder
contracts I'm just saying I would I
would have done it I I would actually
have them killed if somebody did that to
me I would have them murdered I really
would am I
alone and and here's the thing if
somebody does something just to me I'm
going to be pretty mad but this feels
like an offense against the world
itself th this feels like such a deep
offense just feels like it's against the
world itself here's what I think will
happen I think that Elon will use all of
his resources to destroy the rest of
their lives in every way that he can
within the legal
system which would be a good result
too so I I do think that if you do this
kind of thing your life should be
destroyed and I'd say that about the
prosecutors and I'd say this about these
lawyers because
lawfare laware is sort of like stealing
a horse in the old
west
you know what I mean in the old west if
somebody stole your horse you could kill
them if you caught him you know sort of
standard because if they took your horse
you're you know you're in bad shape it's
that's how bad it was you could kill
them for
it well law fair is that
bad uh Joe Biden insists he did not
interact with uh any of Hunter and James
Biden's business partners of course we
all know that that's ridiculous it's
very proven that he's lied about the
whole thing
and but what I don't
know so axios is
reporting uh that there's there's a big
difference between um the cash on hand
for uh the Biden campaign they've got
130 million in the bank but Trump's
spending a lot of his money on legal
bills so he's he's running out of cash
at the
RNC now so Biden has $130 million of
cash
now what is unstated in this axio story
is how many diamonds does he
have or did he lose them all because I
think you'd have to look at that
separately because the bidens have a bad
bad experience with diamonds you know
hunter lost the diamond that China gave
him and uh and uh Biden's brother Jimmy
he got a diamond but he lost that thing
and it makes you wonder how much of the
how much of the campaign you know how
much bigger could it be if they didn't
lose all their
diamonds am I
right all right
um looks like uh Jimmy Biden got a
million dollars from two companies based
in Panama this is new
information uh and didn't do any
services for it so how many stories do
we have now where one of the Biden
Brothers R son uh got a bunch of money
from a big Corporation in another
country that United States has dealings
with and gave them no services in
return it's happened a few times right
now do you remember the story about
Hunter getting tough with the Chinese
company saying you know I'd hate to I'm
paraphrasing but something like I'd hate
for my father to be mad at
you meaning there would be consequences
if you don't pay
up now I've heard it said that is
perfectly
legal uh although ethically sketchy for
the Biden family to be out there shaking
down people for for cash under the
influence buying
assumption even if they don't provide
any services at all so I guess they
found a
perfectly legal
workaround they could take people's
money and provide them no services at
all and it's legal
but allow me to reframe this situation
and put the whole Hunter Biden family in
jail not his family but uh Joe and Jimmy
and Hunter it goes like
this I'm pretty sure blackmail is a
crime I I will accept I'm no lawyer but
I will accept that taking money from
other countries under the promise that
you might be useful but doing nothing is
probably not illegal but you know what's
illegal
you know if you don't give me this
money something bad might happen in a
political you know sort of governmental
sense I don't know if you know but I'm a
person a close personal relative of
somebody who's part of the
decision-making process and it couldn't
always go your way if you know what I
mean you know it's probably going to not
go your way if you didn't give me this
money that's blackmail isn't it do do we
have any lawyers in the house how in the
world is that not blackmail if they're
getting no Services except the
protection of the
family am I
wrong and and why has
nobody why has nobody brought up this
point that it's EXT oh extortion
extortion is a better word blackmail not
extortion you say to me it looks like
extortion
is it only a crime in the other country
is that the problem that it would be
maybe a crime in the other countries but
it's not a crime for us to extort
somebody in another
country well actually I I need a fact
check on that if if if I try to extort
somebody in another country and I
succeed and they give me money have I
committed a crime as an American or is
it only if I extort people in
America
be in other words is the crime committed
only on the essentially within the
nation that has the
victim I don't know how that
works so here's what I think we should
do we should stop saying that they're
selling influence because that's their
frame their frame is that they were
selling influence and it was legal you
know they started out by saying we're
not doing anything but once it became
clear they were selling influence then
they say well it's legal I think we
should stop framing it as influence they
were extorting other countries they were
literally threatening them you know an
implied threat that if they didn't play
ball bad things would happen to them now
that might be hard to prove so that
there might not be any legal you know
recourse there but if I were the
Republicans I would say it's a Shakedown
Racket and you don't want a blackmailer
being part of
your
government if you literally have a black
mailer as your president an extortionist
or his family is extorting on his behalf
however you want to say it that's not a
good
sign you were asked to play ball when
you were a newspaper reporter
wow um
you offered to do the bribe you the
Queen's congresswoman Grace mang's
father Jimmy mang got convicted of bribe
taking when he had no legal power to do
anything he threatened or offered to do
for the bribe
Giver okay I don't know if that's
directly
relevant yeah yeah the influence
pedaling needs to go away I don't think
they were pedaling influence I think
they were pedaling um threats look like
extortion to
me all right
um that ladies and gentlemen concludes
my amazing show um I'd like to say
goodbye to the people on the xplatform
and Rumble thanks for joining and uh if
you're on the racist YouTube platform I
would recommend that you find a
different platform and now support
racist companies um so I'd go with
rumble or X if you care about that stuff
although I must say from a technological
standpoint YouTube is quite a Wonder
it's quite amazing it's one of to me
YouTube is one of the most impressive
technological um accomplishments of all
time it's very impressive anyway uh
that's all for now I'll see you tomorrow
same time same
place
