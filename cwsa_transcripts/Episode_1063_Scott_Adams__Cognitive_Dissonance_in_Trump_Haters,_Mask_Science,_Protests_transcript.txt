[Music]
hey everybody
come on in gather around it's time for
coffee with scott adams but you knew
that
that's why you're here for the best part
of the day the part that makes
everything better yeah now
if you're new to this it doesn't take
much all it takes is a copper bug or a
glass of tank or chalice or stein a
canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now
for the dopamine hit of the day the
unparalleled pleasure the thing that
makes everything better including the
coronavirus the economy racism
protests you name it it's all better
with one sip
go
my white blood cell count is climbing
i can feel it well the biggest news in
the world
might be the rain in china
because it's raining so hard that the
so-called three gorges dam
which uh is pretty big dam it's damn big
might actually break
which is a really big deal
a super big deal so this would be a
disaster uh on a level that would be
hard to
even calculate it looks like it might
happen
and one of the risks is that our the
factories that make pharmaceuticals for
this country
are in the flood zone so there's a
non-zero chance that the pharmaceutical
industry will get wiped out
this week so we got that to look forward
to
um but let's hope that doesn't happen i
would guess that the chinese are working
very hard to relocate anything that can
be relocated
so maybe they'll prepare in time
let's see portland
it's the 50th night of protests with
fires and big visual things
check out cnn.com to find
all the stories and the pictures the
fires the protesters
nothing if you look at the right hand
column on cnn.com those are the stories
they don't want you to see
so it's over there is just one line of
text
portland protesters
no picture so it's pretty clear that
that at least cnn doesn't want you to
see those pictures
but i don't think that even fox news is
playing it up
so i think there's some kind of
agreement not to show these protests
and i would love to know the real story
behind that
all right uh i
announced today that i'm going to start
blocking anybody who argues
that the science has proven face masks
won't help against the coronavirus
okay so don't say you weren't warned you
could you could have your opinion
and you can tell other people but here's
here's my reasoning
um i'm not a scientist
and i can't tell you definitively
whether masks
work or make things worse but i can tell
you
that if you're also not a scientist and
you go on and say definitively
the sciences proof and mass don't work i
don't want you in my world now
okay because that just hasn't happened
this is not true
if it's true that you've never seen the
studies including
yesterday in the wall street journal
showing that
face masks make a gigantic improvement
if you've never seen those studies then
why not i mean i've seen both the ones
that say they work and the one they
don't
and i've seen lots of them lots of
studies that say they don't work
lots of studies to say they do if you
haven't seen both
you shouldn't have an opinion so i'm
only blocking people
who are not aware of half of the world
i'm not i'm not blocking you because of
your opinion
i'm blocking you because it's been long
enough
right you know in the beginning it makes
sense that you haven't been exposed to
all the information
but now there's no excuse at this point
if you are not aware that major
publications
are reporting that face masks even the
the casual kind do make a big difference
even if they're wrong all right this is
important
even if they're wrong if you don't if
you're not aware of it
that's a problem all right so i just
and i'm so bored by it uh
i guess i'm bored that people think that
if they send me yet one more study
from the past to say it doesn't work
that that will be the one study that
that changes my mind and and makes me be
irrational it just doesn't work that way
all right so that was just my personal
frustration probably had nothing to do
with you
so here's a question i've been asking
just because the
the answers are funny to me it goes like
this
after three and a half
plus years of trump three and a half
years i guess is right
after three and a half years of trump
we don't have to wonder what he'll do
wrong
because you've got three and a half
years to look at it so
i like asking people can you tell me
what is the worst thing he's done
wrong in your opinion and here's why
it's so funny
number one the answers are all over the
place
what if i taught you um
that you should assume is true if
there's one question
and people are all on the same side
saying oh trump is bad trump is bad
so in that sense they're very unified
unified trump is bad now give me your
top reason
or top three or four and you'll see
their top three or four reasons
are first of all different which is
weird
because they're all on the same side
wouldn't they all have the for the same
top reason or maybe the top three would
be sort of similar but in a different
order
but wouldn't people have the same
reasons
and here's what's funny the top reason
at the moment
is of course going to be his coronavirus
response
but let me ask you this didn't people
have exactly the same idea
about getting rid of trump before the
coronavirus even happened
their their opinions of why trump should
leave
are identical now to what they were
all they've done is changed the reasons
whenever you see this situation where
somebody keeps
their point of view but the reason for
it keeps changing
it's not a real reason all right if they
added new reasons then you'd have
something it's like all my old reasons
are true
and i've added a few more but my top
number one reason that hasn't changed
it's always the same
but i have added a few more things that
would sound reasonable
but if you're complaining that your
number one thing is is coronavirus
response even if it wasn't good
you have to ask yourself wait a minute
have they just added a new reason
to something that was just they'd
already decided and now they're just
adding reasons
you know the oh my new my new top reason
is this
happens to be in the news this week but
i
i started collecting some of the answers
because they're
they're funny in a certain way
they're funny in a certain way in that
first of all it got more attention than
i thought it would
uh and this morning uh people who
weighed in on this question included
brian brian stelter selter stelter
you know from cnn so brian stelter
weighed in with
with the critics uh also uh
dave isikoff weighed in and matt
negrin who apparently has taken over on
the
msnbc and msnbc show
hardball so all three of these people
are sort of weighing in
on the side of the people saying hey yes
here are all the things that trump has
done wrong
all right so here's the list of things
that trump has done wrong
now remember this is a big decision it's
a big decision to get rid of a president
or to vote
for a new president so here are the
reasons
he downplayed the risk of the
coronavirus
to increase his odds of a china trade
deal
he downplayed the risk of the
coronavirus to
increase his odds of a china trade deal
so the first thing wrong with this
analysis
is that he puts it in some kind of a
personal sense
because i'm pretty sure that the
president negotiating with china
was sort of intended for the benefit of
the whole country
it's really not just something he did
for himself
and it's just funny to hear anybody
talking about that way no
the china trade deal wasn't about the
country
that was just about himself okay
all right let's let's take that a little
further
and he uses and this critic uses word
downplaying the risk
did the president downplay the risk
or did he balance the risk
was he balancing competing interests by
saying well
the economy is important a trade deal is
important
and coronavirus are important too but
it's not a case of one of them is the
only thing that matters
it's balanced so isn't the president's
job to balance the risks
but for this critic if you balance the
risk
you can call it downplaying the risk
and all he did was substitute a word for
my word
and turned a reasonable thing into an
unreasonable sounding thing
even though it's the same thing let me
state these two things with just
different words
my wording is the president balanced the
risks
of the economy the trade deals which are
part of the economy
and the health he balanced them
when i use the word balance that sounds
true
right because he wasn't saying one of
them is the only important thing
he never said the economy is the only
thing he never said the coronavirus is
the only thing
he balanced them now did he balance him
correctly
well that's not really the complaint the
complaint is he downplayed it
all this critic did was replace my word
balance
with downplayed but nothing nothing was
different
it was still the same thing you can't
you can't turn a good thing into a bad
thing by changing one of the words
that's not a thing but
if you can imagine that this person is a
professional writer
for the atlantic maybe you understand
what's going on
here's the number two thing on the list
of things that trump got wrong
on the coronavirus he mocked the virus
in february
that's right he was mean to the virus he
mocked it
he mocked the virus
what exactly did that cause
do you remember when you were feeling
good and then
ow ow i've got a headache what's causing
my headache
and then you find out it's because the
president mocked the virus
that probably didn't happen right or you
went out to start your car
oh god my car isn't starting did the
president
mock the virus again there's no
connecting tissue
between the the biggest complaints about
what what the president did
and anything in the real world which is
what makes it funny
complete disconnect from the real world
so that's the number two issue here's
number three
screwing up the european travel ban in
march and then there was
a detail given that uh there was a news
article saying that by giving a two-day
notice
about the travel ban in europe it caused
all the flights to load up
and people quickly traveled to get ahead
of the band
and then and of course some of them had
virus and brought it into the country
now i ask you this what was the way he
was supposed to do a travel ban
do you think the people who quickly got
on planes
in that two-day window do you think that
they were leaving the country that they
lived in
not knowing if they could get home or
was it a case that people were simply
going home
because they knew they were going to be
there for a while how exactly were you
supposed to prevent people from going
home
how exactly was that going to work and
moreover
in what world are flights not already
pretty much all booked
have when before the coronavirus how
often were you on a flight that wasn't
pretty much fully booked it was kind of
rare
right so how much difference did two
days make
when the only difference was going from
pretty much full
to actually full
and those people probably would have had
to be repatriated to their countries
anyway
so i don't know that you could make a
case
that that could have been done better or
differently i don't know what the better
would look like
if you don't say what would the
alternative look like
you haven't really criticized the very
minimum for a criticism is to say
you did x if you had done y
you know and somebody else did y you
could see that that was a better result
but we don't have anything like that we
just have people taking their best shot
at stuff
and maybe some of it was imperfect
here's another one he sidelined
the cdc in april what does that mean
what does it mean to sideline the cdc
was the cdc the ones who told us that
well i won't go through the list
but the cdc was not exactly bathed in
glory
during this and what does it mean to
sideline them i don't know what that
means
refusing to advocate for mass in may or
june
what difference would that have made
what difference would it make because
trump has never said masks
don't work and he has allowed his
experts
to tell you that they do work
so trump allows his experts to tell you
they work
and then he sort of leaves it to the
states
because that's the system of government
we have if he had done more than
what he did would he not be called a
dictator right now
because he's forcing the states to do
things and the states didn't want to do
it
i don't know if he had that option did
he have that option
um i would agree that he
could say more about masks
but he's not he's not stopping his
experts from telling you you should wear
them
have you ever seen that there's nothing
like that
he's letting the science talk and then
he's telling you what he's doing
could he do a better job of modeling
behavior i would say yes
but i don't know that you could
necessarily say you'd notice the
difference
in what people did
and then something about blocking
testing funding in july
i don't know what that was but it sounds
like fake news it sounds like
when you hear somebody blocked of
funding
and then you dig down it's usually
something more along the lines of
it was supposed to be in another bill or
this bill had some things in it that
didn't belong
or or you know we were going to do it a
different way or something like that
this is probably fake news i never even
heard of that one
but i don't think that we have a testing
i don't think we have a funding limit on
testing do we
i've never heard that before anyway uh
here's some other things that
that are complaints he turned america
from a shining hill of hope
to a laughingstock do you do you feel
that when you wake up
do you wake up in the morning you're
like
oh i just realized again
i'm not on a shining hill of hope
i did not wake up in a shiny hill of
hope my country is a laughingstock
what because justin trudeau was giggling
at that
that one meeting that time does justin
trudeau not take our phone calls anymore
if we call bulgaria and say bulgaria
we want to do a trade deal do they say
no you are not a shiny hill of hope
you are laughing stock now i will not do
a trade deal with you
does that happen because i don't think
any of this translates into anything
real and here's another one
uh oh so
somebody else i get was this matt negrin
who said
right no one remembers why he was
impeached somebody said that to me i
don't know who it was
so one of the things you'll notice is
that when you ask
what trump is doing wrong like what or
what has he done wrong
you'll get sarcasm instead of reasons
so here's a perfect example right no one
remembers why he was impeached
do you know what my first response to
that was
why did he get impeached something about
ukraine or something the phone call
and then i and i say to myself oh the
thing that was so
unimportant it barely barely held onto
my memory
and was completely political and was
ridiculous and didn't matter anyway
even if everything that had been claimed
about the president
were true what impact
none there's really none
that i can think of so anyway it's
hilarious to ask people
to name specifics oh then one of the
examples was 11
unemployment rate to which i thought
really
somebody is criticizing president trump
over the current
unemployment rate that's like
somebody who has never followed the news
or something
i don't even understand that so
everybody who says
sweden i might start but start blocking
people who
mentioned sweden because
sweden is just different and we don't
know why
exactly so sweden is just
different we don't know exactly why
so if you're making a point with sweden
you're not making a point
that is really a point all you're saying
is
there's a country what about estonia
i don't know what about estonia we don't
know why it worked why it didn't
what they exactly did we don't know
sweden is no longer an interesting
question
they're just too many things different
uh let me ask you this
how many how many countries that
regularly
supplement with fish oil which has
vitamin d
are having a bad outcome
sweden has heard immunity somebody says
no it doesn't
i doubt that's true i doubt it's true
that they have heard immunity
and i doubt they're even close could be
i won't say that there's zero chance but
it could be
so here's a viewpoint that i want to
share with you somebody shared with this
with me
sincerely and because it was sincere
i wanted to share with you and see if
you feel the same
and it goes like this that the wearing
of masks
while it might have a medical benefit or
it might not
so this is somebody who's you know at
least open to it being beneficial
but the larger point is that
wearing mass could lead to the breakdown
of society
and the collapse of the country
so the point of view if i can i hope i
can express it right
because it was worthy of mention so the
point of view is that if we're forced to
wear masks
we lose the thing that connects us as
human beings
and once you've lost that thing that
connects you as humans
because covering this much of the face
really disconnects you from people
that once you do that the social
cohesion of the country will be
diminished and there and the risk
of complete civil war becomes
bigger than it would have been now it
doesn't mean that it's guaranteed to be
a civil war because you wore mass that's
not the claim
the claim is that the odds of a civil
war
go up enough by wearing masks
that that's a mortal risk and it's
enough of a reason not to wear masks
what would you say would you would you
agree with that statement
that wearing masks loses our humanity
and our connection to each other
sufficiently so that it could cause
it would be one factor that might make
it more likely
for a revolution which would be gigantic
expense
i would say i don't buy into this at all
not even a little bit but i wanted to
see if anybody else
felt that it feels like the smallest
risk in the world
but i wanted to see if anybody had a a
feeling that oh
there's some people who are agreeing so
somebody's saying yes i agree
true empathy block others saying good
grief
uh no agree
agree so so some people have some
sympathy for that view
now i don't know that uh that is
something that could be tested
but just because something can be
expressed in words
as a risk doesn't mean you should
consider it a risk
so i'm typically on the view of well
you know there's no there's no such
thing as zero risk you should at least
put some odds on it
but that would not extend to something
that is so obviously
not a risk that maybe you don't need to
do the math
oh well there's enough of you who think
there's something to it
let me ask you this do you feel any
different
i know the people i care about tend to
be the people that i see without masks
anyway
the people i would care about would be
my family you know
people were close to me i just don't
have that feeling
i just don't think it's a thing but some
of you do so we'll leave it there that's
all we can say
charles barkley had a public statement
on video
that was a real
echoing what kareem abdul-jabbar said
which is uh
he was encouraging black people to not
be anti-semitic
because it works so much against your
self-interest
because obviously does
and and barclay says this directly
we can't be prejudiced if we're asking
white people to respect us
and he says i don't understand how you
beat hatred with more hatred
so i'm completely on board with charles
barkley but listening to him
and also to kareem abdul-jabbar
it it reminds me that the black
community
doesn't have a strong leader
it's really noticeable isn't it that the
black community
has lots of concerns that are legitimate
but they don't have sort of this one
leader you know and you'd think it would
be obama but he's kind of you know
retired if you will
but when i hear somebody like barclay or
uh
korean abdul jabbar talk out in such a
pretty productive way i mean i think
this is exactly the most productive
way that you could talk i asked myself
why can't we get more charles barkley he
feel
to me he feels like he's really good for
the country i'd like to see him have
more leadership role
there's a new new
controversy about roger stone so the
controversy is
this is the allegation and you can put
your own
odds of whether this is true and maybe
by now we know because i've
i turned off my computer a few minutes
ago but
the allegation is that he was doing a
interview with a
uh a black disc jockey whose name i
don't remember
and that allegedly roger stone
said when he thought that nobody was
listening
uh i don't want to argue with this negro
now that is allegedly what he said when
he thought nobody was hearing
on the phone but it was allegedly
clearly
heard and so when i heard that story i
said
wow i've got to hear this for myself
i've got to hear this for myself so
i clicked on the articles i'm looking
for the the link where i can listen to
it myself
and it's not there so i go okay okay
maybe there's some reason the new york
times doesn't have the link
so i go i google it i kinda gotta hear
this for myself because it just
that doesn't it sounds like the kind of
thing that maybe didn't happen you know
what i mean
so i gotta hear from myself so i go from
article to article to article
including something by the disc jockey
himself
with a tweet and i'm looking for the
link
have has anybody heard it has anybody
heard
the actual audio because i don't know if
we're gonna hear it
don't they record all radio shows
you think somebody recorded that right
so here is my question to you although
it is reported it
is very clearly said on that audio
just remember all the times things have
been clear on audio and video and just
weren't true
so you should have a really big
dose of skepticism coming into that
story
and i would i would encourage this if
you don't ever hear it with your own
ears it didn't happen
if you do hear it with your own ears and
other people who are not crazy you say
i'm listening to it too and i don't hear
it
it probably didn't happen
so i don't know will we ever hear that
video it if it
turns out to be a yanni and laurel thing
where if you're thinking that you can
hear it but if you're not thinking it
you can't hear it
probably didn't happen it was my guess
probably not all right but i wouldn't
say for sure
nothing for sure there was an amazing
campaign video that apparently was not
made by the campaign
in which a linkin park song was heard
and the and i tweeted it because it was
just one of the best
campaign ads even though the campaign
apparently didn't make it
because it showed the contrast so there
was lots of contrast between the
the sparkling bright capitalism that the
president
promotes versus
versus the uh you know the cities
falling apart under the democrats
it was a great contrast play but it got
yanked because that copyright problem
which is no surprise all right
um oh here's some more
things that on the list of things that
the president has already done wrong
all right treason pandering to putin
what was the treason exactly treason
who saw treason that sounds imaginary
pandering to putin what's the difference
between
being nice to dictators while you're
you know you're attacking them with
cyber cyber attacks and you're
you're banning their banning their what
what are they doing sanctioning them etc
anybody who says
that the president is pandering to putin
is sort of the lowest level of
understanding of your environment
it's sort of the lowest level because if
you don't understand
the saying nice things to the dictator
while you're negotiating with them
while you're trying to make something
work is just smarter
it's just smarter to be polite to them
and you show them a little extra
consideration while you're also being
tough with them
if you don't understand that that's the
best way to go
you're not you're not much of an
observer here are the other complaints
nepotism corruption and profiteering
what would be some examples
of things that hurt you because of any
of these imagined things
what was it that hurt you i can't think
of anything
nothing's hurt me uh
destruction of institutions of democracy
which ones what would be the
institutions of democracy that the
president destroyed
have you noticed that all these
complaints about the president are these
weird generic
hallucinations that don't even have any
connection
i think the institution was the news do
you think the president
destroyed the news business is he the
one that did that
because it looks like the news destroyed
itself
with their own business model i don't
see how you could
see it any other way anyway
uh hillary's selling our plutonium to
russia what's that called
that's called just doing business if you
believe
that that hillary sold our valuable
plutonium to russia
then you did not understand what
happened
so first of all the plutonium mines were
in the united states
if the united states needed
plutonium and the plutonium is in the
united states
in the mine would we care who owned it
no we wouldn't care who owned it
we just say oh okay you russians you
have to sell us all your plutonium now
you can't sell it to other countries the
fact that they changed ownership
didn't mean anything didn't make any
difference
because they're still in our country if
they didn't sell it to us we just say
all right
you can't have it anymore we'll just
take you back there was never any risk
and our allies canada and australia
they produce that stuff what was was
australia going to stop
selling us plutonium or whatever we need
was canada going to stop selling it to
us there was never a shortage
that was always a fake just a fake fox
news story
uh was it not pluto named uranium sorry
i don't know my plutonium is for my
uranium so erase everything i said about
plutonium and put in uranium
so thank you for that correction with
many exclamation marks uranium uranium
uranium
i hear you all right uh
who do you want to moderate the debates
i don't think it matters
i don't think the moderators make any
difference
uh she sold the plutonium for her
personal
interest well she may have had a
personal interest
but not that it matters
uh if china owns 35 of america no
problem
i don't know what you're talking about
uh she took huge bribes when you say
bribes you mean that
the clinton foundation got some money
possibly so but the problem is not the
selling of the uranium
the problem would be the taking of the
bribe wouldn't it if
if that's demonstrated to be true
um the point is she got
rich from the transaction uh
i believe that the clinton foundation
may have made some money that's
different
all right
uh russia ukrainian
just looking at your comments i don't
have much to say today
[Music]
all right don't know your ass from your
amium
that's that's pretty funny
uh imagine buying a psychology book
from a guy who got a ba in economics in
1979
as expert well if i ever called myself
an expert
i don't believe i have and have i ever
recommended any form of persuasion
that is not fairly routinely known by
science to be
persuasive i don't believe i have
so reporting on something and being an
expert are different
the the people who call me an expert on
persuasion
that's their opinion that's not mine i'm
just reporting what the
what the experts say works and what my
experience says works
that's all i've ever called it if i ever
call myself an expert on persuasion
you should criticize me about that
i wouldn't call myself that
please interview tony heller on heard
immunity
i don't think i will here's here's some
things
that i won't do so you should stop
asking
if you asked me to interview one expert
on a topic in which i've done some deep
diving and i have some information
i might do it so for example when i
talked about climate change
with michael shellenberger and
and also bjorn lomborg that was a topic
i've done my own
reading on enough that i knew i could
ask the right questions
but if i would have some other expert on
an expert on i don't know some other
thing
if i don't also know enough to ask the
right questions
then i would be doing a disservice to
you because having one expert blather
is worse than having no expert so let me
give you the order
of of understanding
your best situation would be two experts
who have opposing views
who have enough time to talk and maybe
there's a strong moderator that can keep
them on the right page
that would be the best way to get
information to experts
battling it out within a time limit
the next best in terms of understanding
your world
would be no experts so the second best
situation from having two experts on
different sides is no experts
that's your second best situation your
worst situation is one expert
because that one expert just like one
attorney
will convince you that they make sense
any expert can convince you of anything
if you're not an expert in that field
so if i were to bring on one expert i
would be giving you
disinformation because any time
one expert is presented and there's
nobody there to ask the right questions
that's misinformation now it doesn't
mean that it's always misinformation
but it does mean you should put the
lowest level of credibility on it
which effectively makes it no
information at all and since there's at
least a good chance that is misleading
or the expert
is wrong there's a good chance of
misleading people
with no chance whatsoever of giving
people credible information
so anytime you say can you put this
expert on to talk about let's say herd
immunity
what do i know about herd immunity
nothing some people say it's 10
to 20 percent some people say it's 60 to
70 percent
that's it so if i have an expert on who
says a bunch
of stuff would you be informed
well you would have new stuff coming
into your head
but i had no way to know that is right
so is that a good thing to do it's a bad
thing to do
it's a bad thing to do
have i read michael shellenberger's new
book on climate change yes i have
i have read it and it's excellent
could you interview rachel maddow to
identify the exact moment
insanity begins when you watch
rachel maddow does she look
uh what's the right word saying
i don't know if you have this uh
impression now i'm not making a medical
diagnosis
of rachel maddow or anybody else this is
just an
impression because i'm sure that the
people on the left
have some kind of an analogous
impression of people on the right
and it probably looks like when they
look at them they look like they're
lying or stupid or something
because they can't understand why their
opinions would be different
but when i look at rachel maddow
she looks to be
again i'm not stating this as to me some
kind of fact
because i don't know what's in her head
but she looks to be
hypnotized meaning she looks to be
like someone who's dealing with a
hallucination
or a series of them as opposed to
somebody who's grounded in the real
world
it's just an impression that does that
mean i'm right
no you should not take that as any kind
of credible anything i'm just telling
you my impression
but i'm wondering do you have the same
impression when you see her
when you see her talking do you say to
yourself
well there's a different opinion it's
different from my own
maybe different priorities she has
different set of facts she's looking at
does it look like just someone with a
different opinion because it really
doesn't
it doesn't does it it looks
like there's a phenomenon happening
and it's not one that's good
like there's something going on
emotionally or
psychologically that's not quite right
and let me say again if you were to
take you know take a an iq test
and you were competing against rachel
maddow
good luck because she's going to clean
your clock on an iq test
if you're if you're trying to test your
knowledge of the world
historical or otherwise against rachel
maddow
good luck she's going to kick your ass
because she knows
a lot and her iq
is really high so really smart
really talented uh really knowledgeable
and still and still i can't get past the
fact that my
subjective impression is that there's
something else going on there
just an impression um
and i don't think she's alone in that by
the way and and i think i could probably
pick out some people on the right
who strike me the same way
but nobody jumps to mind
and blumps response
somebody says does alex jones look crazy
uh
that's a complicated question because
alex jones presents himself as a sort of
a character
and the character he plays
is a sort of a complete character
no i don't know how close his character
is to what he would be if you talk to
him in person maybe it's exactly the
same i don't
maybe just you know attenuate it a
little bit for tv
but uh alex jones
is trying to be alex jones
so that feels like a different situation
from somebody who's trying to be
a more objective tv personality
i don't know that you could say alex
jones
is anything except exactly himself which
is all he pretends to be
um somebody says is she smart yeah
rachel maddow is super smart
don't take that away from her
all right that's all i got for now i'll
talk to you
tomorrow
