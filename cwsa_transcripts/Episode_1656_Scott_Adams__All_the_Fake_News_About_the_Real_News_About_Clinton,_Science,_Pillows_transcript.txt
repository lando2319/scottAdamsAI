good morning everybody
and congratulations
because you made it to the best moment
of your life
so far
it's called coffee with scott adams if
you're here by
intentional planning or just good luck
doesn't matter your day is about to
reach a pinnacle
and maybe your entire life
and tomorrow
even better
so if you'd like to take it up a level
and i know you would because that's the
kind of people you are
and if i may say so
you look like you lost weight
i'm just saying and your hair
oh your hair looks great today
but uh
forget about that for now all you need
is a cup of burger glass a tanker tells
the steiner canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dope being here today
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous
sip
and all you mother sippers out there
join me now
oh
i'd like to introduce you to my new
friend
uh it looks like a weapon but it's not
does something like this
oh i'll just be doing this today
oh
no i'm not taking uh endorsements in
case you wondered
speaking of that we're going to talk
about that in a moment
by the way it's pretty it's pretty
amazing usually you can't make yourself
feel good
if you notice that you can't tickle
yourself
with one exception you usually can't
make yourself feel good but you can
actually massage yourself with that
thing it actually feels like
somebody else is doing it
pretty amazing just got it
well here's the good news uh
it looks like aids may have been cured
maybe
a little too early to say
but a woman who had a form of leukemia
received a transplant of stem cells from
an adult relative and umbilical cord
blood from a newborn
and i guess it's that umbilical cord
blood that's the magic part
and not only did it keep the
hiv
in remission
but they think it eliminated it
because up to now we've we've had things
that
looked cure-ish
but only a few rare cases i think people
couldn't find the actual virus but now
it looks like they have a method which
maybe is reproducible
how about that for your golden age huh
golden age
yeah
what did you do during the pandemic i
cured aids
that's what somebody did
yesterday
i made a big show of taking out my
scissors and cutting up my face mask
because california
ended the last the last day of uh
a face mask was yesterday so the the
mandate ended yesterday
do you know what i thought that meant
i thought that meant i didn't need a
mask
what do you think it means when they say
the mandate ends yesterday
here's what they meant
oh it's not over yesterday
you still have to wear your mask all day
yesterday
that's just the last day
are you kidding me
i went to the gym and everybody had a
mask on i mean not everybody but a lot
of people did
uh you know i didn't i didn't wear mine
you know nobody's gonna say anything the
last week before the mandates come off
or the last day
so there was no difference in california
that i could detect
so california dropped the mass mandate
and there was no difference
now apparently the the counties have to
weigh in so i think there was a delay
for the counties to say what they were
going to do
uh and most of the counties are saying
that uh the adults can take their masks
off i think starting today
but the there are two groups that can't
de-mask yet
uh criminals in prison
and children in school
i'm not making that up
that's actually the california policy
if you're a prisoner or a student
you get treated the same
not making it up
there's no hyperbole there that's
actually the policy
now you know there are a few other
things like health care facilities and
you know old people homes and stuff
mass transportation
but
is that a little bit
too on the nose you know what i mean
so why do we have that situation well
thanks to rasmussen we have a little
insight they did a poll and found out
that 82 percent of liberals want masks
to continue in public places
what
82 of liberals
want to continue masking in public
places
but what about the conservatives who as
you know
are looking at exactly the same science
11
11 of conservatives are in favor of
masking in public now
and 82 percent of liberals
so uh let's go follow the science shall
we
who believes that people can follow
science
is there anybody still who believes that
myth
that human beings can follow the science
you can see it as clear as day
it could not be more clear that people
can't follow the science
because they don't know what it is
if they knew what it was they might
follow it
there's not one person on here who would
disagree
with the idea that you should follow the
science
assuming the science is correct
there's not one person and yet they go
in opposite directions
because of politics
so if you ever thought that humans are
capable
of following the science
can you rule that out now
you can right
how many years have i been telling you
that following the science is a little
bit nonsense because we don't know what
the science says
even science isn't quite sure what it
says so how in the world are we supposed
to follow science when we're just
guessing what science says
now until i said that
well
until you saw this stark
data
that the two the two political parties
were marching fast in opposite
directions
on the same science
same science
until you see it that clearly you don't
really believe that humans in general
don't have any capability following the
science none
we have zero
zero
capability as human beings
and this includes myself
we have no capability of following the
science none
we don't know if it's real we can't tell
we just guess
so everything that you see that looks
like people doing their very best to
follow the science
in a traditional
model of the world
it's just people trying real hard and
the smart people get it right and the
dumb people don't right
was that your world view even say a year
ago
a year ago when you've said yeah people
try to follow the science the smart ones
who do research get it right
the dumb ones who don't do research get
it wrong and that's all it is
but then you look at the difference in
the political parties
and you know it's not that it was never
that
it was never the smart people getting it
right and the dumb people getting it
wrong
it was always
guessing
it was always guessing we just thought
we were right when we got it right
and then when we get one wrong we would
just forget about it
or we'd say well that of course science
isn't perfect
i followed the science but you know it's
not going to be 100
so we just rationalize it away when
we're wrong and we pat ourselves in the
back when we're right but it's just
guessing it always has been
same with stock picking
but that's a
we won't go down that path again
so i asked this quest this question on
twitter
which of these three countries will be
destroyed first
will ukraine be destroyed by putin
will denmark be destroyed by coven
because they drop their mandates
or will the usa be destroyed because of
progressives
and my totally uh fair and valid
scientific poll with no bias whatsoever
said
93 of you said that usa will be
destroyed by progressives
now this would be exactly the kind of
poll you shouldn't pay attention to but
i thought it was fun
so so far denmark seems to be surviving
freedom
i know it's a big surprise
it turns out
that freedom is not fatal
to a lot of countries
oh it might cause some extra infections
might cause some extra deaths
but freedom itself is not terminal to
countries
it's actually kind of healthy
so maybe we should do a little more of
that that freedom stuff
um i'm going to remain a uh
let's see what is it rogue i guess when
it comes to
uh
putin and ukraine
i'm still gonna say he's not going to do
a full attack
he might use the pressure to try to
annex something or
get some concessions or something but
i'm still gonna say no attack
and i base it on the fact that he can't
know he'll have a good outcome
and it's too risky
right so if he can get anything out of
the deal anything i think he'll take
that and go home
and i think maybe the biden
administration
may have played it correctly
mike cervich had a provocative quote
yesterday as he often does
actually that's redundant isn't it
to say mike cernovich had a provocative
uh tweet
that's like saying two things you're the
same
let's just say uh mike cernovich tweeted
and he asked
what world leader was the first
to offer help after 9 11.
who who called the president of the
united states first to offer help uh
taking care of the terrorists and when i
say taking care of them you know what i
mean
i think it was putin's
so that
i believed that there was a period of
time
in which we could have
you know turned uh that into an ally
situation
but i don't know when things went bad
exactly certainly by the time clinton
was in was secretary of defense but
perhaps before that i don't know the
history of it
so whatever is happening between russia
and the united states
seems to be
fairly history based don't you think
is that fair to say that there's that
there's some kind of history
between russia and the united states
recently you know putin versus various
leaders there's something going on there
that is really the
the base reality that everything else
springs from i think
um
scott don't you realize that russia
wanting to invade ukraine is a hoax well
i'm definitely not calling that a hoax
yet
so it looks like negotiating to me
um
what do you think
give me your opinions right now will uh
will there be a full-scale invasion of
ukraine
a lot of people say no all right here's
here's another secret to subtext
what are the odds
wait for this question i want you to
hear this question really clearly
what are the odds
that the biden administration has to
protect the ukraine administration
because of the dirt that they have on
biden
and they don't want that dirt to leave
ukraine and be in the hands of the
russians
there's a really high likelihood of that
isn't there
if anything that we've been hearing
about hunter biden and ukraine if any of
that's real and i don't know you know
who knows what's real i don't know
what's legal and what's sketchy and
what's not
over there but if any of that's real
maybe the main reason that we can't um
let's say treat the ukraine situation
objectively
is we may have a personal problem with
our president and ukraine
and i can't imagine that ukraine doesn't
have the goods on hunter can you
don't you think that ukraine would would
keep the secret if they have any
this is speculation but if they had any
agree if they had any
secrets about hunter
don't you think they'd keep those
secrets
and use that as uh leverage against
biden of course
why is it that um the president
of ukraine keeps acting like there's no
attack imminent
what does he know
because that's that that's the strangest
part isn't it
because there's no leader who acts like
that
under the circumstances that we can see
so given given the data that the public
has
what we can observe
it it makes no sense
that the president of ukraine is saying
i don't see any attack what attack
it makes no sense
the only thing that makes sense is that
there's something big we don't know
about
right
something big
i don't know what that is
that something big might be
wait for it
that he has so much blackmail on biden
that he knows that the united states
will stop a russian attack one way or
another
either through
canceling financial deals or threats or
cyber or something or something
i feel like zielinski's a little too
confident
and one of those reasons might be that
he has biden in his pocket
how do you rule that out
i'm not saying that i have evidence of
that
i don't
but how would you rule that out given
that it seems at least
i mean at least it's a strong
possibility
could you deny that
that's a strong possibility
kind of a dangerous place to be for the
world
but i don't see russia and the united
states getting into a a shooting battle
with each other
i do think
that putin's not going to get ukraine
there might be some kind of independent
region thing going on maybe something
like that but maybe in the long run he's
just going to keep squeezing until he
gets what he wants
we'll see
um
does it seem to you that the kids these
days have no game
i
i i'm so
cautious about just turning into the old
man who yells at the clouds
you know
it feels like the kids are not fighting
against the mandates as much as we'd
expect
now there are some schools that are
having some you know protests and stuff
but they seem to be sporadic
and
i was trying to think how i would have
handled this in high school
here's how i think i would have handled
it
i think i would have organized
protests not against the man masks
but a protest to require these the
teachers and the administrators to wear
full hazmat outfits
to protect the precious cargo
and i would just play as straight i get
the whole school to protest
that that the teachers and the
administrators are not safe enough
from the kids
and that the kids are are a dangerous
source of coveted
death and the kids are very concerned
about the health of their teachers and
their administrators and they don't feel
the masks or enough protection
so i would lead a full protest
to demand that our teachers and
administrators wear full hazmat outfits
all day during the day
no taking them off for the bathrooms no
taking them off to eat
you you better put the food inside the
bask before you go to work
and drive there
and i would never let go of it
and i would never act like i was joking
i would play a straight
and i would say
let's uh we got to follow the science
people you're not following the science
i i would grow i would go full greta
tunberg on this
and i would push the absurdity as hard
as hard as you can push it because the
absurdity is the
soft underbelly
right
as soon as you act like this is really
about science you've already lost the
debate
because you're not in charge of saying
what the science is
somebody else is in charge of that
so they say the science is and then
you've got to do what they say
so you've got to break that model
you've got to find the most absurd part
of what they're doing and make it bigger
right take the most absurd thing they're
doing and make it bigger not smaller and
that'll break the system that's how i
would have done it
and i know there are people saying you
wouldn't have done that if you were in
high school scott to which i say
clearly you did not know me in high
school
oh i would have done that yeah i would
have done that
i would have come to school wearing a
complete mummy outfit
if i thought it was funny
well here's a question that i've been
asking about uh bitcoin and crypto in
general and how how secure and private
it is
because when we heard that the
government somehow clawed back some
billions of dollars in crypto that had
been stolen
i said to myself
well
that makes sense to me but other people
seem surprised
and i thought to myself clearly there's
a way to get any money
because you can get it to people
if you can get it the people you can get
in anything because you could just make
the people give you passwords or
whatever
so i never understood the idea that
bitcoin was secure
not at all i mean
or or that it was anonymous in any way
any way that mattered
um and sure enough now we know a little
bit about how the feds
got money back from there was a couple
who stole several billion dollars 4.5
billion
so some a couple managed to hack i guess
4.5 billion from i think an exchange
although the money was worth less when
they stole it it just went up in value
but here was the problem
apparently there's no way to launder
crypto into the real spendable world
now
i wondered how people did it
but i didn't know there actually is no
way
so there's there's one site apparently
where you can go to allegedly do it
where you can go to launder so there's a
what is it what's the site called
you'll you'll remind me in the comments
there's a
some kind of a pirate site where you can
go do that but apparently that didn't
work
so
if you go to a site that's designed to
launder
illegal money who should you be assuming
already has control of the site
i'll say it again if you knew there was
a website
whose existence was to
launder illegal gains
who would you imagine is running the
website after the first month
the feds
of course
or the cia or you know some kind of
federal group because the feds are not
going to allow
an illegal money laundering thing to be
there but if it exists they're
definitely going to you know
control it so they can get all the money
launderers and roll them up easily
so it turns out
that there was no way so this
this this couple were so smart that they
could do this complicated hack and they
were using all kinds of shell companies
and shell accounts and thousands of fake
accounts to move things around
and with all of that
with all of their cleverness and fakery
and fake accounts and everything there
still was
no way
to get their money
did you know that
did you know there was no way to cash
that out
without getting caught
yeah now i assumed that was the case
without knowing anything about this
world really
but i just assumed there's no way you
can steal that and not get caught and
sure enough they got caught
um
so
here's a question i asked
when do we reach the crossover point
at which if you've got 3d printing and
you've got robots manufacturing things
and you do a bunch of logistics
improvements because we're always
improving you know logistics how you get
the materials to the place you want it
how long before it's just cheaper to
make everything locally in the in the
united states
now some people who are in this business
that is pretty close
so people who have 3d printer
startups and whatnot say yeah we're
actually pretty close but other people
who know a lot about this world say
if you did a plastic injection molding
you can make a part in a few seconds
but if you're trying to print that same
part it would take you know all day long
or something so that you never get to
the point where printers can do the job
of
injection molding
to which i say
what
that example doesn't make any sense
let's say i can use injection molding
and it's 50 times faster
don't i just need 50 3d printers
i do right
i just need 50 3d printers
somebody says no but why wouldn't i be
able to uh print the same amount with
just more printers
now how about this
do you think we'll ever have a world
in which you can have a 3d printer in
your garage
and it prints on demand
for some nearby company
you just load it up with whatever you
know is the equivalent of ink i guess
and
and you get it you just make it
available on the internet
and you say i have a 3d printer of this
type so i can do certain types of
printing but not others you say i have
this printer of this type
it's available on these hours so you can
schedule the printer
and then you've got virtual companies in
your your local area
that just use your printer at your house
and they just print on demand if it's
available
and then it's up to you or maybe there's
an uber-like service that picks it up
or maybe you put it in the back of your
pickup truck and drive it to a central
location i don't know it seems to me
that between logistics robots and 3d
printing and keep in mind
that the robot could be doing the
injection molding right
so that still falls under my
under my category of things that don't
require
expensive processes
so
i think we're really close to the point
where a hundred percent of manufacturing
could come back to the united states
and we could get rid of shipping costs
and probably have much more flexibility
as well
now there's also
there are
3d printers
how many of you knew this
you could buy a 3d printer that prints
another 3d printer
did you know that
now i think not every part of the 3d
printer so you probably have to buy i
don't know like the cartridge header or
something
but if you can make a 3d printer that
makes other 3d printers
then all you need is to buy the raw
materials
so the cost of the printer
becomes equal
to the cost of the material
now now is it cost effective
but you can see how easily this can go
from not cost effective at all
to the point where you can make a
printer make a new printer
i think it becomes cost effective really
fast doesn't it years ago maybe 25 years
ago i was at a
dinner with some high-powered executives
and one of them was a futurist
and the future said that when robots can
make their own robots that's when
everything changes
and we already have 3d
printers that can make 3d printers
it's a little bit like a robot making a
robot isn't it it's a little bit
and so i just wondered where all this
could go but i think i think the only
point i'm going to make there here is
that you imagine that the crossover
point is happening slowly right
it's like oh incremental improvements in
3d printing but we're nowhere near
taking over for injection molding we're
not even close
but the cost of doing business in china
is also going up
for political and other reasons
so so the cost of china is going up
let's see the crossover point
china's going up
and the cost of
3d printing is going down
here's my only point
for the first 80 percent of that journey
it's gonna look like it can't happen
so for the first eighty percent of
getting close to that crossover it's
gonna look like it'll never happen
because it's just to be these little
incremental changes and then something
like
printers making printers happens and
then that last part goes boop
so the first 80 will be all of the the
hard slog and then last 20 percent is
just going to happen instantly and when
it happens
you should see a complete collapse of
china
because when the stuff starts the
manufacturing gets pulled out of china
it's going to happen in about 10 years
there'll be a 10-year period where it
all just all collapses and goes to
whatever the new model is robots or
printers or something
so china has that to look forward to
president trump announced that his new
social media platform truth
is in beta form which means you won't be
able to see it yet
but
they're looking at march i guess
to have that out
what do you think
i hear tell that it's going to be a
subscription service
which is interesting
because if it's a subscription service
like the locals platform
then you don't have to worry about
advertisers
and then you don't have to worry about
censorship
it might be a good model
for that alone and
can you really not sign up for the ones
the one uh
the one social media platform that trump
is on
now obviously the democrats won't
except for journalists i guess but
uh
i feel like you almost have to
as soon as i saw it i thought oh crap i
have to sign up for this now just to
know what's going on and you know feel
like i'm well informed and stuff
so we'll see how that goes
um
the one thing that they're doing right
is the subscript well they may do more
than that right but the subscription
model might be the thing that sets them
apart that could be the thing that makes
it work we'll see but you need a trump
to have enough pull to make a
subscription model work maybe maybe
maybe we got enough poll there
all right
um let's talk about uh
durham
so the wall street journal editorial
board is weighing in on this story about
the durham filing
in which it is alleged that the clinton
campaign worked with lawyers
who worked with a tech guy who had
access to some internet data
both at the trump tower and at the uh
and at the white house
and now the lawyers for the accused mr
sussman i guess it is
are saying that the data that was
collected
was from the obama era only
what do you think of that
does that sound even remotely true
so so literally the story the cover-up
story that pundits are actually saying
out loud
and i'm gonna add some hyperbole to this
but this is basically what they're
saying
they're saying that durham with all of
his capability and all of his resources
that there was nobody on the durham team
who could use a calendar
that's actually the news today
in effect i mean i'm
adding a little to it but in effect
the news is reporting that the you know
one of the most highest powered lawyers
with a whole team of people
can't read a calendar
and they couldn't tell
that the data they were collecting
was from before trump's
terms and so the defense is oh this is
all before chop so
obviously we weren't spying on trump
because the data is not even from his
era
now do you believe that
that is the most ridiculously obviously
untrue statement i've ever heard in my
life
we are actually being convinced
that democrats probably are convinced
that durham can't read a calendar and he
couldn't tell the difference
between data that happened before the
data that happened
during the trump administration
seriously
we're actually being told that today
with straight faces
people are actually looking at saying no
that data was collected during the obama
administration
straight faces
they're actually saying that right out
loud in public
oh my god
oh my god
so the wall street journal editorial
board is all over this now and you were
wondering um
you know why isn't there more pushback
on what is obviously a cover-up of the
story i mean obviously
and
it does look like hillary clinton and
her team are going to completely get
away with this
at this point it looks like they're
going to make this story the biggest
story of
several years
just go away
and it looks like they're actually doing
it and it's working
and i'm not even sure i'll be talking
about it next week because even i'll
forget about it
it is beyond
shocking
beyond shocking
so um
there was a report that uh hillary
clinton was spotted uh by 400
eyewitnesses and several video streams
uh literally stabbing to death a member
of uh well actually a trump supporter
on the steps of the supreme court
400 witnesses
several video streams
lots of dna at the scene
and the clinton defenses it didn't
happen
it didn't happen
and if it did happen it was technically
legal
so that's the defense
no none of that happened
but it could have
seems like it could have
there's a uh
i saw this from ian
bremmer uh tweet
i guess there's a pew research that says
talk about the percentage of adults who
have quote a great deal of confidence in
medical scientists
in 2020
2020
uh 43 percent of the public
according to pew
had a great deal of confidence in
medical scientists 43
that's lower than i would have thought
i would have thought it would be over
half but okay 43
uh in december of 2021 that dropped to
29
so the entire medical scientific
community
has disgraced itself to the point
where they've lost credibility with the
public
it's pretty hard to lose credibility
when you're the
medical scientists of the country
now we get that they could get stuff
wrong
all right we we all understand that the
scientists of any kind are going to get
some stuff wrong so it's not that
there's something else going on
this isn't really about getting stuff
wrong is it
that's that's not why the trust went
down
it's because we think they lied
it's not because we think they made a
mistake
it's because we think they lied to our
face in ways that are completely obvious
to us
so
i mean it makes sense to me
well let's continue watching the chess
pieces being removed
from the
the board so i guess george clooney is
going to make a docu-series
about some ohio state wrestling sex
abuse scandal
that apparently features uh
representative jim jordan republican
and not in a flattering light so he's
not accused of any crimes uh he's
accused of knowing about them
right now i don't know anything about
the story so i don't know who's guilty
you're not guilty of anything so i don't
have any opinion on that
but i think this is more of the larger
trend where the stronger players are
being identified and taken off the field
likewise uh the my pillow
uh
founder um
mike lindell is saying that his bank
just discontinued business with him
the bank decided that they wouldn't take
his business anymore so i don't know
what kind of financial distress the my
pillow
organization is in but he's being taken
off the field now i'm not saying he
shouldn't be
right
so don't don't get me wrong i'm not
arguing that anybody
said good things and was always right
i'm not saying that you know that some
people shouldn't be taken off the field
yeah left or right sometimes people need
to get taken off the field right for
good reasons but
um doesn't it seem to you that there's a
roll-up going on on both sides
you're going to see the strongest
players on both sides from you know the
original trump era
you're going to see all of them targeted
and taken out
and
yeah matt gates would be another example
the cuomos were taken out much of cnn's
been taken out
clinton seems
she seems bulletproof
yeah joe rogan taken out et cetera or at
least reduced alec baldwin although that
was his own doing rachel maddow is off
the field right i'm seeing more names
going by
so
is it planned
yeah i don't know
it does look planned
it does look well
maybe not essentially planned but don't
you think that everybody knows they need
to reduce the voices of the strong
strong voices on the other side
everybody knows that
all right yeah elon's still there and
tucker is holding on
i would think that the crown jewel would
be getting tucker
i have to think that tucker carlson has
led a very clean life
think about this
think about the fact that tucker carlson
is he's got to be number one target of
half of the country
and nothing
nothing
right i mean the things that they attack
you for are the things he says
in the course of his job
but apparently
that's okay with the people who watch
him so he's safe
but apparently he's never done anything
that was especially wrong or
that anybody knows about
so
uh
he's in a good position right now he's
in a very good position
yeah so elon's being attacked
oh berenson is gone that's true
naomi wolf is gone
did that experience him get anything
right
let me ask you did alex berenson get
anything right
is there an example
the attitude he had the attitude right
let me see
did he get anything wrong yeah i thought
i think he got almost everything wrong
didn't he
at least
according to current understanding
all right well i don't know so i guess
we'll never know who got what right and
what got wrong because we won't agree
what was right and what was
wrong you're saying you gotta write
about cannabis i doubt it
all right all right even al sharpton was
in trouble but i don't think he's
nothing's wrong with that
okay
well
uh that
uh well let me just add this one other
thing about the uh story about uh
about clinton
the the thing that will be left out of
all the stories
about clinton asking for her lawyers to
get this dirt on trump
what will always be left out is that she
paid the lawyers
to get the stuff
what they will always leave out
is that it did include the trump era i
think that's going to happen
and what they will leave out is that it
was
although it was legal for the people who
had access to it to have it i'm not sure
it was legal to
pass it on
although if you're passing it out to law
enforcement maybe that's always legal
so you'll see that the people's
defending
clinton on this story will simply leave
out parts of the story and they can do
it because people don't know enough
about the story and it will just work
all right um
is uh justin trudeau still in office
i've never seen anybody look more like
they know they're gone
than when he gave that press conference
about the emergency powers it really
sounds like he knew he was gone didn't
it
to me it looked like
a person who knew that was the end of
his political life
it looked like it i mean who knows what
he was really thinking
now here's another observation
democrats
rank children lowest
in importance
and
republicans rank them highest in
importance
true or false
because if you look down the uh
the various issues
all right abortion
you know of course the democrats who say
it's not even a human it's not even a
person so that one's clear that's you
know republicans in favor of
children or
or children like entities if you want to
be a word thinking about it
then you've got
uh they don't want critical race theory
taught in schools republicans what is
good for kids that they learn that
they're defective or special based on
race
or that they don't learn that i mean
it's obvious what's better for kids
masking of kids it's obvious that the
republicans are on the right side of
that
at this point in my opinion it's obvious
um what about um
yeah it is the children last party now
the exception would be
if you wanted to be devil's advocate the
exception would be climate change
because greta has done a good job of
granite tunberg of framing that as you
know the children against the old people
who are destroying the planet
but
you have to accept
greta's
estimates of
catastrophe in order to even buy into
what's good or bad for kids
i would think that trump is actually
closer
to right about what's good for kids
because if you can lower the cost of
energy you're probably going to make
everybody a little richer that's good
for kids
right and probably you'll have more
money to remediate and that's good for
everybody including kids so i think you
can make an argument that
climate change it just depends on your
assumptions about what is true
that's really not about what is good or
bad for kids that's more about of an
assumption
all right and
democrats are not in favor of uh
school choice
generally speaking
school choice is obviously good for kids
so i think you could really make a case
that democrats are the anti-children
party
um
the brainwashing of kids well
brainwashing happens
necessarily you can't not brainwash kids
it's not enough it's not an option
really
all right
greta has no solutions that's true
if she had solutions she would stop
talking
all right
um
and there you go and somebody else is
saying there aren't many kids coming
from same-sex uh marriages well there
are kids coming from those marriages
but you're right not as many
all right uh that is all i have for
today
and uh today theoretically adults in my
state should be masculist
but we'll see how that goes i'll test
that out and we'll see
greta is yelling at the tonga volcano
all right
uh how about van jones co-parenting
article i didn't see it is van jones
writing an article about
uh is it about government
being a co-parent is that what it is
or is it about couples
sf school board recall yeah there's an
effort by democrats to recall the more
progressive democrats
can you give a live stream lessons to
kim iverson
uh
sure
i mean if she asked for it
um more micro lessons
yes they are coming i've got one all
cued up i just have to put on video
is the lawyer's name sus man a sign of
the simulation
that's funny
the lawyer who is suspected
who's a man who is suspected
is actually named a sus man
he's a man who's a little bit sus
in this case
yeah i'm saying on local's comments that
uh that biden wants to stir up trouble
with uh
with putin
so that they can cancel nordstrom
too
i think that's part of it that's not the
whole story but it does feel like that's
part of it
it has that feel to it it's just a feel
though
uh
scott how are names being a coincidence
is a sign of the simulation well it
could be a sign that the our simulation
is
designed with a sense of humor or or a
code that repeats
but you know i wouldn't take that one
too seriously
as a sign of the simulation i wouldn't
take it seriously at all
oh how to follow through on something
after you've decided on something
that's a good one remind me of that
again i think i will do that one
actually because i do have something to
say on that
um
uh what do you think of the judges and
the palin case i'm not really following
that case
now that's her case against the new york
times right
have you ever felt anything that you
personally felt were glitches in the
simulation
yes
not that they were
but usually when i'm sure i left
something somewhere
i can't find it
i'm sure the simulation deleted it
but you know then when i find it where i
i really actually left it i think oh
okay maybe i just forgot where i put it
all right uh banks freezing the
protesters funds yeah
that's more bad behavior in canada
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you tomorrow
