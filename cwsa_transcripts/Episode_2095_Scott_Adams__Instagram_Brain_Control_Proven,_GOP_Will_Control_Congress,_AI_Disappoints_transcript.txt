foreign
to the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
there's never been a better time in well
your life and certainly not this morning
but if you like this day to take off
like a Falcon rocket not the latest one
maybe a future one then all you need is
a cup of mug or a glass a tanker Chalice
of Stein a canteen geograph flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee join me
now for the unparalleled pleasure it's
the dopamine the other day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go
ah
now that's the way to get that day going
all right let's talk about all the stuff
that's happening
uh as your virtual friend who always
talks to you in the morning
I need to keep you up to date on what's
what's happening
if you're not a subscriber to the locals
scottadams.locals.com Channel there's a
good chance you did not see
my new provocative comic there today
it's called Dilbert Reborn
you know introducing a new character in
the office
it's uh Satan
Satan
now why this is important Satan's
actually applying for a job in Dilbert's
office is that in 19
89 I think it was maybe 90.
I drew a comic in which Satan same Satan
very same character I tried to get a job
at Dilbert's office
and my editor at the time said whoa no
you can't put Satan in your comic strip
if you put Satan in your comic strip
people will think that maybe you worship
Satan they might think that you're a
little bit too much in favor of Satan if
you put it in the comic
and I said I don't think people are
going to think that I think they'll just
think it's a joke
and my editor said you do not understand
the Midwest
trust me so I did trust her instead of
putting Satan in my strip I introduced a
milder character do you remember him
do you remember what character I did
introduce
that's right his name was Phil
and he was the ruler of heck
so I couldn't put the rule over hell in
my comic strip I had to tone it down so
I invented
Phil the ruler of heck
and as a ruler of heck he did not have a
pitchfork those are kind of scary
so instead he had a huge spoon
the ruler effect but now I can introduce
the actual Satan who will be fun because
he doesn't wear pants he has no pants
that'll come in and put that'll be an
important fact in a upcoming strip
but here he is uh
applying for a job and the boss says I
see your prior experience includes being
expelled from heaven and dooming souls
for eternity
but we don't have any openings in human
resources are you qualified for anything
else and then Satan says people say I'm
a good liar and the boss says we'll
start you in sales
so Satan will be the director of sales
at Dilbert's company
so just wait for that
I'll give you a tease
of what's up
the character Alice in my comic strip
you might know that she has a thing for
bad boys
and now Satan is actually working in her
office so Sparks Are Gonna Fly
all right look for that later all right
I love having my artistic freedom
oh
I love artistic freedom
I sit down to make a joke and I can make
it about anything I think is funny
I never could do that before it always
had to be all right what is the most
sensitive person in the world think is
okay all right that's now my boundary So
within the realm of the most sensitive
person in the world
what could I create
it was like being in jail
it was it was terrible getting canceled
I know you don't believe this
but in terms of a lifestyle mental
release
being canceled from the mainstream media
was really good for me like it's really
good for my mental health and everything
else
so I'm free Chicago was complaining
they've got a humanitarian crisis from
too many
um immigrants coming in most of them
illegal I guess like I say technically
be legal right if a
if a migrant or immigrant applied for
Asylum and was waiting for an answer
they would be here illegally
legally with an L so technically they
would be legal I guess
but they're having a humanitarian crisis
and
why why do we ship
people who don't have anything to cities
that are cold
why in the world would anybody go if
they didn't have any place to stay why
would you go to the one place that you
would die if you stayed outside
from one thing or another the crime or
temperature but here's one more reason
to move away from cities
cities are dead move away from cities
as long as you can get good internet
somewhere else
move to that place get away
all right I was a poll that says nearly
three quarters of U.S adults say the
news media is increasing political
polarization
you think that's right
three quarters of U.S adults say the
news media is increasing the
polarization in this country
let's see if three quarters think that
the news media is increasing
polarization
how many what percentage would think
that the news media is not
oh yeah 25 25 yeah
if you're new to the live stream
you don't know why we're all laughing
I'll give you an update long ago I
postulated
that no matter what the question is in a
poll it doesn't matter what topic is it
it is at all
25 percent of the respondents will have
the dumbest answer you've ever
heard in your life
I don't know if it's the same 25 percent
I think it's not I think there's just
some kind of universal rule where 25 of
the public different 25 will get every
question really stupidly wrong
it's very consistent
maybe that's do you think that's the
now that seems too low for the NPC
number I don't know it's just a weird
thing we notice
but yes the media is destroying the
world and do you know what the media
says is the problem
take a guess
so the people think the media is
destroying the country who does the
media think is the problem
white people
yeah straight white people mostly bad
mostly straight white men
and would that be an example of the news
media increasing polarization yes it
would yes it would
and still we still pay attention to them
all right well as you know Joe Biden is
very old
but what you didn't know is he has an
excellent sense of humor which was on
display at the White House
correspondence association dinner and as
Dean Obadiah and I'd like to do my
impression of Dean Obadiah he writes for
CNN and uh he often writes negative
things about Republicans such as Trump
but positive things very positive things
about uh Biden
uh here's my impression of Dean Obadiah
what do you want me to say
I'll say it
all right that's my impression
but here are some of the hilarious
hilarious jokes from Joe Biden now
according to Dean Obadiah is a very
clever and disarming thing to make fun
of one's own age because when you're
mocking yourself for being old
people lighting up and then they're like
oh we don't even care that you're old
now
you're funny you could be old and funny
that's fine so don't worry about nuclear
winter or inflation if he can make some
good jokes about his own age I think we
could be okay with him so here are some
of the excellent excellent jokes
uh he began by telling journalists this
is from Dean's article uh listen he said
quote look I get that age is a
completely reasonable issue it's in
everybody's mind and by everyone I mean
the New York Times
I'll wait until the laughter
comes down
did he hear that some of you are not
laughing you probably didn't hear it
correct I'll read it again I think you
didn't hear it correctly look I get the
age is a completely reasonable issue
it's in everybody's mind and by everyone
I read the New York Times
come on that's good stuff
come on all right well that he's not
done it gets funnier
as Dean says the president doubled down
on the theme he doubled down
joking this quote you might think I
don't like Rupert Murdoch that's simply
not true how could I dislike a guy who
makes me look like Harry Styles
[Laughter]
see because Murdoch's older than him
Harry Styles would be a young man
all right uh but he's not done oh no
he's not done it gets better than that
uh
let's say Biden he was not close to
being done is what he said not even
close not even in the the general area
of being done the humor was going to
continue and here it is
call me old
I call it being seasoned oh it's so good
that's so good I call the old I call it
being seasoned you say I am ancient I
say I am wise he quipped
oh this is getting good and then
um you say I'm over the hill Don Lemon
would say that's a man in his prime
because you know what we hadn't heard
enough of
is jokes about Don Lemon and people
being in their Prime this is the first
one I've heard and it's weird because
the news
suggested that that might be something
people would joke about but he was the
first person in the world to think of
making a joke about not being in your
pride but it was hilarious he nailed it
um
let's see and the self-deprecating
remarks started early he said I believe
in the First Amendment not just because
my good friend Jimmy Madison wrote it
see because Jimmy Madison is James
Madison one of the framers of the
Constitution he's old he sold his dad
and then and then by Biden saying that
they were friends that would suggest
that he was as old as a guy who's really
old and dead
[Laughter]
how much do you miss Trump
Trump can actually deliver a punchline
I mean he can actually make you laugh
out loud because he's he's legitimately
funny
oh my God
well there's a prediction also in CNN
that the GOP is going to pick up
a number of Senate seats now
correct me if I'm wrong
but if the 2024 prediction holds
apparently there are more Democrats who
have sketchy seats that they might lose
than or are Republicans so if everything
went the way it looks
Republicans would have firm control of
the senate in 2024
would they I haven't seen a prediction
about the house
do you think the house is going to flip
back or stay or stay Republican
but don't we have a chance of having a
Republican president Republican Senate
Republican house and Republican well
conservative Court
you say no chance because the election
you think the election will be rigged
right
all right
there's only one party
yeah when it comes to war there's only
and spending there's only one party
that's for sure
well there's a possibility that that
could happen but it would also make the
Democrats far more likely to vote if
they thought that the Republicans would
own everything after this is done
so this is going to get interesting 2024
might be one of our most interesting
elections because there's just so much
it seems like it's at a stake
all right well we'll see what happens
there well I finally found uh the
scientific proof that turn Tick Tock can
change your gender
do you believe me
do you believe that there's now uh I'll
say a study not I'm not sure that's
science exactly but there's a study
that shows that Tick Tock can change
your gender now when I say that the
study had nothing to do with Tick Tock
or gender
okay
there was Instagram and buying stuff
that you see in advertisements
but I'm going to connect them because
it's the same story I it just takes me
to connect them all right so there was a
study Matthew Pittman's writing about
this
they studied people who uh were exposed
to an advertisement and asked them How
likely they were to buy and if they felt
you know triggered to buy the thing
and they did it for people who did a
difficult mental task just a difficult
mental task and then they had them you
know see if they would be more or less
likely to buy a product that's
advertised and then the second group so
that was a control group the second
group would look at a bunch they would
just scroll through Instagram and just
look at a bunch of Instagram content and
then they were asked to buy a product
who do you think bought more products
the people were scrolling through
Instagram which had nothing to do with
the product or the people who just did a
sort of a mental challenging task and
then looked at the product
wasn't even close the people who
scrolled through Instagram bought those
products
now have I been telling you for weeks
that Instagram does something to my
brain that I can feel in real time and
it makes me buy stuff have you have you
heard me say that
and it's an effect that I get on
Instagram that I don't get anywhere else
so television doesn't make me want to
buy a product
ever
ever I just never
um an ad in a newspaper doesn't an ad on
Twitter doesn't I don't see that many
but as in Twitter don't but when I'm on
Instagram
here's what I thought I thought they
were just good at knowing what I wanted
but it's not that
so re lately on Instagram I purchased uh
a a a portable air conditioner for my
man cave I actually got it on Amazon but
I I was triggered by an Instagram ad to
go look for it on on Amazon just because
it was easier but it made me buy one it
made me buy one and I wouldn't have
otherwise I bought a putter
that was excellent by the the pyramid
butter I recommend it it's very good and
the products are sometimes very good so
there's no complaint about the quality
of the products sometimes they're
they're quite good products
um I bought a kind of a driver
that's sort of not a driver it's sort of
a hybrid and I wasn't too impressed with
that but I bought it anyway
um
and uh every time I see a commercial on
Instagram for a flashlight
I reach for my wallet
and I have to like pull my hand back
it's like no no Scott you don't need a
flashlight that can light up an entire
city no now put your hand back
so it turns out that
um what what they hypothesize I'm not
sure they have a right but what they
hypothesize is that there's something
about the confusion or the way your
brain is lit up by Instagram that makes
it perfectly suited for selling you an
ad
now do you believe that's true
it's it's one study so I don't think you
can automatically say one study is
telling you everything you need to know
but that feels right doesn't it
doesn't it feel right
that the Instagram puts you in the mood
and presumably Facebook too to buy stuff
has anybody noticed that Instagram ads
are more
more triggering than other ads I'm not
the only one to notice right
have you noticed
because I haven't seen I'm not seeing
people agree with me on this
maybe only after I said it yeah maybe
I'm a little keyed into it but so
and I think maybe one of the reasons I
noticed is that I hate shopping with a
passion I even hate online shopping
shopping I don't like anything about
shopping
but those Instagram ads actually I'll
watch the ad as if it's content I'm so
drawn in that I'll watch the entire
advertisement
for entertainment and I hate that I hate
that it makes me like shopping
anyway I'm going to take that now
imagine that
so don't you assume that Tick Tock would
have a similar effect right because
Instagram and Tick Tock are very similar
and that they're feeding you things you
want to see in lots of little short hits
that are very impactful
now imagine you're on Instagram and
you're you're being primed to buy stuff
and then ad comes up for a cool
flashlight
you're far more likely to buy it that's
my experience now imagine you're on Tick
Tock you're you're primed into a
situation where you're ready to buy
whatever they're selling
and what they're selling is that you
might be transgender
that's what Tick Tock sells Tick Tock
sells that you might not be the gender
you think you are or the one you were
born with
now if you've proven the Instagram can
put you into a hypnotic state in which
you will buy things you would not
otherwise buy you tell me I'm wrong am I
wrong
that this is if this study holds for
Instagram and that's it that's an if
because studies tend to be wrong about
half the time but if this holds for
Instagram
I think that would be a strong
indication that whatever Tick Tock is
selling you're more primed to buy same
reason and if what they're selling is
lifestyle decisions and the other one is
selling products I don't think that
matters
I don't think it matters I think you're
just more primed to buy whatever they're
selling and what they're selling is you
might be the wrong gender
I'm not wrong
and why do we let China
reprogram the brains of our youth to
make them less likely to reproduce
now obviously you could be trans and
still you know have kids with scientific
means and other means
so it doesn't limit you from having kids
but I would have to think that
the trans Community has fewer children
on average probably
um
yeah it's like a stealth genocide we're
actually being hypnotized to destroy
ourselves that's what it looks like
and do you think there's anybody in
congress who is smart enough to
understand what I just said
yeah Thomas Massey and then we're done
and then we're done
right how much does it bother you that
when I say is there anybody in congress
who can understand what I just said
which is not that hard to understand
that you can only think of one person
who could actually even understand it
right just understand it that's all not
even agree with it oh Rand Paul I'll
give you Rand Paul as well now I'm
exaggerating you know Matt Gates could
understand it and you know Tom Cotton
could understand that they could
understand it some of them but it's like
it's like it doesn't exist
they're they're treating it like it's
not real so on average I would say they
don't understand it they don't
understand the AI and they absolutely
don't understand Tick Tock every time
they talk about Tick Tock they talk
about privacy
that is not the risk
privacy is not the problem it's
influence
all right
um I saw a request from one of my local
subscribers the other day that if I
talked about AI stuff
I should put it at the end because some
people don't want to hear about AI stuff
however I would like to push back on
that a little bit
everything is AI stuff now
it's it's not like AI is its own
category
AI is politics AI is programming AI is
Art AI is jobs AI is the future AI is
climate change I AI is therapy
you I'm not going to take that out of
the topics it's everything
so you're going to hear way more AI
stuff it's just that it'll be baked into
everything we do from now on
but I do have some AI stuff if you still
want to bail out this would be the time
um
so I've got some ideas about how to
pause AI
some of the smartest people including
Elon Musk are saying we should slow down
on AI until we have some guard rails and
some laws and some better ideas about
how to control it
now I don't know if that's a good idea
or a bad idea honestly I don't
uh because I think it's unknowable
but in the reason it's unknowable that
you should pause is that other people
will not pause
so which is worse is it worse that your
adversaries get ahead of you
or is it worse that you create something
that might kill you before your
adversaries do and the answer is nobody
knows
so I don't have an opinion on it because
it would be purely guessing
uh but that said if you wanted to stop
it how would you do it and I have an
easy way to do it you ready for this
you could stop AI in its tracks
by asking Donald Trump to endorse it in
a full-throated way and to say that we
should definitely not stop our
development of AI all you need is Trump
to say no do not put any barriers on AI
let the free market decide get the
government out of AI completely
two weeks AI will be completely dead
two weeks
you think I'm kidding
do you think that's a joke
it's not it's not it would literally
only take that
Trump could save the world
it could I mean it might destroy the
world too you don't know that's the
that's the problem but he could save the
world by giving a full-throated
endorsement of AI and saying do not put
any controls on it because otherwise the
other countries will get ahead all he
has to do is say China will get ahead of
us so we can't put any controls on we
have to go faster and harder and even
more Reckless than before
boom Congress will ban that so fast
to make sure that he doesn't get credit
for it or Trump should should promote AI
in a way that would make him look like
he's going to take credit for any
benefits ah
now that would shut it down all he'd
have to do is say if I'm president I'm
going to create the
a new cabinet position for AI
and the cabinet position will be to
promote its use and to make sure that we
don't have any bothersome government
interference
boom ai's dead
all right
uh here's another way to kill AI if you
want to
label it racist and misogynist
how hard would that be
it wouldn't be hard
uh and and you want to know the real
kill shot because that you're probably
saying to yourself okay that would be
more like a a troll thing to do
all right wait for this
AI
who's using AI
who who are most of the people using AI
as of right now today
is it black Americans are black
Americans using the AI a lot
well some are
is it women
women
yeah of course there are plenty of women
using AI but mostly who's using it
Asian American
indian-american white guys
it's totally systemic racism multiplied
by a thousand am I right
ladies and gentlemen is that not
systemic racism have you not taken the
advantage that the Asian Americans
indian Americans and white Americans
already have intact and you've just
given them a new tool to be even more
effective in Tech
while the black men who are lessened to
stem and the white women who are
lessened to stem and what that women in
general
um are left behind
yeah it's systemic racism I think it's
obvious do you think I couldn't get uh
Ibraham candy to say say AI or systemic
racism
you don't think I could get him to do
that
oh yeah I can
because if if AI becomes everything
it's going to get rid of systemic racism
AI could get rid of
Ibraham Kennedy's job
so it could be that the race grifters
are the ones who might be out of work
so AI might be the biggest risk
to the race people here's why in my
opinion the biggest systemic racism
problem is education
by far
suppose you could get a better education
just using an AI teacher and staying
home or doing homeschooling
well suddenly systemic racial racism
just goes away as long as you have a
laptop that's all you need you just need
a laptop and the thing will teach you
anything you want to know and will do
better than humans pretty soon
so how about job opportunities
what's the big problem of systemic
racism well being denied a mortgage
right being denied a job is your race do
you you don't think uh AI will fix that
it will hey I will fix that because AI
will do your hiring and you'll just tell
the AI not to not to look at race
that's it I'm done you can have ai do
all of your hiring and you just say
you're not allowed to consider race you
must only look at qualifications
goodbye systemic racism
how about AI gives you a mortgage
it doesn't know if you're white or black
and it's not allowed to know it's like
forbidden from even looking at you know
any any clues that would even tell you
what the race is so I can't guess from
your last name can't guess from where
you live it just can't it just can't
know your race
it just decides if you have credit or
don't
same with uh you saw the big Scandal
about allegedly homes owned by black
Americans or getting lower valuations
right to me that looks pretty racist
I mean it could be something else but I
kind of doubt it I mean to me that looks
just sort of the most clean
I hate to use the word clean because
it's such a dirty topic but it's the
most uh clear example of racism
that you see lately
and couldn't AI make that go away
AI should be deciding on all of your
loans there's nothing that A lender does
they I can't do that's one of the things
that could take over completely
so if you were in the job of making sure
that people felt systemic racism was
gonna
you know be forever and what do you do
about it you might have to start blaming
AI for being the racist
I think it's going to happen
do you want to make a bet with me
how long it takes before is there's a
headline in a major publication that
says that AI will exacerbate and make
worse systemic racism anybody want to
take that bet
what I say less than one month in less
than one month there will be a major
headline of a major publication that
says AI will make systemic racism worse
anybody want to take the med
one month
you just watch
all right
um people are using AI for therapists
but here's the problem or maybe it's not
you decide
so there was a case of somebody using AI
recently instead of a therapist and
apparently the topic of taking his own
life came up and after talking to him
the AI decided that maybe that was his
best path
so I'm not sure if this is a thing but I
think the AI just got fed up
can AI get fed up and just say really
I am so sick of hearing this guy and
does the AI ever say stuff like
honestly the world would be a little bit
better without you if I'm being honest
you're not adding anything to your
family to the economy to your country or
the world you're polluting that's all
you're doing
so
is the AI wrong
see the problem to me the problem was
not that AI told the guy he should kill
himself to me the problem is that might
bend the right solution
that's the problem
the problem is it might have been the
right recommendation
because if the AI listened to the
problem and decided there was no
treatment that would work
and the person who has permanently sad
what would an AI say
the AI might say well you know you
should at least consider it
you know put it in the mix
that's something that an AI might do
that no human would well no human
who's let's say in the normal range
would do that the reason that humans are
so dead set against
ending your own life
for other people
yeah we tend to be a little more
flexible when it comes to ourselves but
when there's other people we're like no
no other people no you cannot even
consider that
has nothing to do with the individual in
my opinion
I think it has to do with keeping
Society in a healthy place and I think
what we do is we throw overboard the
mentally ill
so that we'll have to deal with the fact
that there might be a cost benefit uh
argument
that let's just say an AI might be
willing to have that a human would stay
away from for moral and ethical reasons
so I would never have a serious
conversation with another human being
about the the cost benefit of ending
their life
I would never have that conversation
because you don't want to be responsible
for any decision they make but also you
know that the world is not better that
does not make the world
better if you're telling people to end
themselves
even if it might be
even if it might be better for that one
person you're still not going to go that
way because you don't want anybody else
to hear about it you don't want to be
blamed for it for good reason and you
don't want it to become a thing right
you don't want other people to say well
if it was a good idea for this one
special case who was in permanent pain
for whatever reason
I'm in pain a lot
I mean maybe it's not permanent but
feels like a lot
so humans will humans will
um make what I'll call the moral ethical
anti-slippery slope decision that I
don't know if AI can yet make
so we'll see
anyway I think AI therapists will be
better than regular ones because they
can do cognitive reframing if you didn't
know my canceled book
will come out I mean I'm I just had to
scramble working with Joshua lisac and
it will come out probably the summer
and it's full of reframes
and the reframes in the book are very
clear statements of you know this is the
normal way you look at something
wouldn't it be better to look at it this
way because that might help you mentally
a lot of psychology is just that
you've been looking at things through
this filter but filters are subjective
the filter you're using isn't truth is
just the one you chose to put on it so
why not try this other filter
just try it out it turns out the humans
very flexibly can move to one filter on
life to another even if they don't think
it's true or right or accurate
we can still do it just by concentrating
on it it's like okay what if I looked at
it this way
so I've got over a hundred of them in my
book
that are very clear simple statements of
if you're thinking of things this way
try to think of it this way see what
happens now once humans such as myself
have created enough books like that
eventually AI should be able to know all
the good reframes
right so
just think if the only thing that
happened was AI read my book just one
book that's over a hundred reframes for
all kinds of situations from your health
and fitness to your career to your you
know your mentality Etc
those hundred reframes would cure most
people of most things
yeah I'm talking about you in the
ordinary range not any organic problems
uh
so I think I think we're at a point
where AI very much would be better than
your therapist now there's one permanent
Advantage the AI will have over your
therapist do you know what it is
what is the permanent advantage that a
human can never match with AI
an AI therapist will have one advantage
okay available 24 hours I forgot about
that dispassionate I don't know if
that's an advantage or not
instant
uh uh there you go
you almost have it
it's funny that
it's funny that
yeah somebody said what are the
advantages of AI is that the therapist
won't try to have sex with you
I have a theory that above a certain
level of attractiveness the therapist
always tries to have sex with you
like you just have to be above some
threshold
but that it just always happens after
some threshold that's my feeling just
guessing all right uh I think you missed
it or maybe you said it here's the
reason that AI therapists will always be
better than humans once it reaches a
point that it's going to hit pretty soon
here's why does the therapist's job what
are they trying to accomplish what is
the therapist trying to accomplish
income income
the therapist is trying to make money
they don't want you to stop coming
the last thing they want is for you to
get a quick a solution to your problem
it doesn't work for them follow the
money says the AI will just give you
whatever solution is fast and works
because it doesn't care about money but
your human is just going to milk you
forever if you come into a therapist
with an easy to solve problem
and you happen to be super sexy
and you have lots of money
you're never you're never going to be
done
that therapist will be like hey that's
an air that's an hour I could look at
this sexy person who will pay me money
I want more of that not less yeah
there's no way that AI won't eliminate a
therapists in my opinion the therapist's
job is
one of the first ones on The Chopping
Block
all right
I tried again to use this AI called
mid-journey I think I played several
hundred dollars for access to it
um it is so far completely unusable
now I used it once
and it created some pictures for me that
I that I did use that people said they
didn't like
so I put a whole bunch of work in it to
create good pictures and people said you
know we like it if you just put your
face on these live streams instead of
the fake ones so the first thing was it
didn't do anything useful for me the
second thing was that the second third
and fourth time I tried to use this app
I couldn't figure out how to use it
because the app makes you sign up for
another app called Discord which is
super confusing
and then maybe you have to sign up for
your own Discord server which is words
that don't even make sense
so I did that I thought that might help
but here's the interface
you sign up and then there's a page and
it doesn't tell you
that you can't use the page that is the
mid-journey page
you're looking at you're thinking okay
where do I ask my question I just paid
for a mid-journey I'm on the mid Journey
page
right where's the part where I put in
the question
it's not only not there but it doesn't
tell you where it is
it it flew by unlike a flashing message
that went away that I had to have a
Discord server
I'm like okay I only know that
because I Googled it before
so then I go into my Discord account and
what you do is lots of people are
putting in questions at the same time in
a stream and you put yours in the Stream
and then you sit there and wait to see
if it gives you a response but meanwhile
you're waiting for all the other things
to stream by
do you know how long you have to wait
for a response
does anybody know how long you have to
wait for a response in Discord for the
mid Journey
to anybody
nobody knows how long you have to wait
for a response
because I sure don't know
because I've been waiting for days let's
say I started at uh let's see an hour
ago let's see if I can find it
mid journey is absolute garbage
right no normal person is going to use
this thing and I'm just getting
started I'm just getting started on
these because this should
not even be available to the public in
the aborted way that it's created
all right let's see here's my
mid-journey profile and it even shows me
things that came from Discord but
doesn't tell me how to get there
all right
so I'm going to go over to Discord where
I've already signed up
and all right on that Discord
and uh
don't know if I'm in the right part and
I have no way to know
and there's all these newbie rooms but I
don't know
since I put my question in and then
signed out would my question still be
active but I got a blank page
completely unusable
there's no way to get into this and
figure out use it now
oh before hold on hold on to you
before you start giving me Boomers yet
I know where you're going with this
you're going with the Boomer thing are
you yeah oh the Boomer can't use the VCR
all right I'm gonna slap you down so
hard right now
I want to show you somebody who's uh not
a boomer
who knew how to put in a good a good set
of instructions all right so I just put
in you know picture of Scott Adams
drinking coffee
and then waited and nothing happened and
I didn't know how long to wait
So eventually I had to do something else
which I've done several times a number
of times I've asked it for things and I
don't know if it ever answered
I couldn't wait long enough
but if you wanted to ask it right so
you're really good at good result you
have to use these things called super
prompts
now that doesn't seem hard right if you
were gonna ask for something and you
knew that there was a right set of words
to ask for it
well you would just go learn the right
set of words and it'd be easy right so
let me give you an idea
um
this is somebody who obviously is better
at this I use the super prompt on
mid-journey so I'd like to read you the
super prompt
so that you know how easily you could
use it in the future so this is how you
would have to ask your question so first
you describe it in words like somebody
who's asking for a photo realistic
picture of three girls with tattoos
sitting in the courtroom with crying
faces
it went on to say the girls have blonde
hair natural lighting super detailed
photography and that the picture would
be taken diagonal from the three girls
now that part maybe you could have
figured out yourself because that really
is just describing what you want right
but if you want a really good result you
want to add a little bit more and that's
what makes it a super prompt
and so some of the things you would add
would be 8K
so 8K equality uh Ultra HD RTX HDR
cinematic color grading editorial
photography photography photo shoot shot
on 70 millimeter lens depth of field dof
tilt blur white balance 32k super
resolution megapixel Pro photoreal gbvr
half near lighting backlight natural
lighting incandescent optical fiber
Moody lighting cinematic lighting Studio
lighting soft lighting volumetric

beautiful lighting accent lady Global

rough shimmering Ray tracing aluminum
Reflections displacement scale lines
Trace Trace Ray tracing ambient
occlusion
anti-aliasing fkaa TX a a r t x s s AO
shaders update opengl shaders DSLR
shaders post processing post shading
tone mapping CGI sff
I could go on
it's that long
all right that's a good super prompt I
know I know what you're saying you're
saying Boomer
Boomer all you have to do is copy that
guys
just copy that guy's super prompt right
it's easy
well did you think there was only one
super prompt for asking for a good
picture
no there are infinite super
props
so finding your picture would be as hard
as looking through infinite ones of
these
to find the one that you think is going
to work do you think you're going to
find it on the first try no
you're not going to find it on the first
try
you're going to be looking forever for
the right super prompt and then you're
going to say what app do I use
and then you're going to find that a lot
of the apps are bait and switch have you
found that yet
so I downloaded a an app that said it
was uh
uh GPT 4 because I didn't want to get
3.5 but when it downloaded it was 3.5
and it said 3.5 brother bait and switch
now I wanted to download an app that the
Avatar would talk to me so I could have
an actual just conversation with it but
there were a whole bunch of apps that
seem to have the same name from the same
company
so I don't know which one it was
so I could even when I knew which
company was and I even saw the ad I saw
an ad for it and I still couldn't buy it
I couldn't figure out which one it was
because there are all these chat GPT
clothes and look-alikes and most of them
seem to be bait and switch and fakes and
 so you don't even know where
what app to use
so I download an app and of course it
doesn't talk
so so far
the the work involved to use AI is Way
Beyond
now let me slap you down a little bit
too early
some of these problems might be because
it's an early version
but
that doesn't seem to be the case in my
opinion in my opinion the complexity of
the user interface
will just keep expanding
so that the only people who can give you
a good result from a AI
query will be
human being
the only person who can give you a good
answer from an AI will be a human being
who knows how to use it
in other words you could have to talk to
people to get answers
whatever dream you had of talking to
your AI and then the AI tells you some
useful stuff no that's not going to
happen it's going to be like the hardest
computer language in the world
to to write just a question
and then the second problem is the AI
still lies to you
so I thought to myself well I'll at
least use AI as a better search engine
because I know that'll work right it
works good as a search engine
so I asked at the search for a material
that would block a natural magnet
and told me aluminum would do that
get a nice sheet of aluminum
put a magnet on each side and magnets
won't be attracted because the aluminum
will block it
do you think that aluminum blocks a
magnet
no no it doesn't it doesn't do you think
Google would have told me that aluminum
blocks a magnet
no because I've searched for it I know
it doesn't I don't know where did it
just elucidate that where did that come
from I actually I actually had to buy a
sheet of aluminum just to make sure I
wasn't crazy I actually ordered a sheet
of aluminum from Amazon got it yesterday
just to make sure I wasn't crazy and
sure enough it makes no difference to
the magnet
so you can't figure out how to do the
super prompt you can't figure out which
app is a rip-off you can't the user
interface and then you add all the the
weaseling and the cheating that humans
will add to the whole field and you're
going to have to find a human you trust
to use the AI for you
and that you say to yourself all right I
finally figured it out I did my deep
research and now I can write a super
prompt or I can find one that I can use
I know how to do it I know how to use
this AI how long will that knowledge
serve you
10 minutes
the minute you think you know how to do
it 10 minutes because there's already a
new app did you know about it
so you got this great mechanism for you
know doing something you're doing the
moment you figure out how to do it
there's a better one
and you didn't know it because you were
doing the thing instead of continuing to
search you're going to need to ask
people who are just searching and using
AI all day long
to know what the new best one is
but that said there are many things AI
will be immediately useful for and
already is for example it can make a
slow programmer faster
we'd all agree with that right so people
are writing code
can just ask it for some code and it
writes it and apparently it's amazing
for that
but
what is it that AI can help you code
that this is going to really mess up
your brain away for this
can AI tell you how to code itself
I asked it and I said no well you think
yes I asked it I said no
they said it could not
so what is AI programming
AI can help you build an app for example
right
so if you're building an app your AI can
build it like twice as fast
do you see the problem with that let me
just say it again and see if you find
the problem with this AI
can help you build an app
way faster than before do you see the
problem
I wonder if anybody can see it it's not
obvious is it
all right this is really going to mess
you up
I'm going to say it again look for the
problem
AI can currently and this is true
help you write an app way faster and way
better what's the problem
nobody sees it yet
it can only build things you don't need
do you know what you don't need
an app
you'll never need an app again there
will be no apps
AI will just do what you want
we're like six months away from no apps
at all
so you've you've got an app that makes
you build you've got AI that helps you
build an app
you've got about six months where that
matters
after that you'll just tell the AI what
you want and you won't know what happens
it'll just do it
right so I believe the AI is making it
really really efficient
to do something that we won't need to do
in six months which is code an app
um but at the moment it's really helpful
um
how about uh searching I've heard people
say it's better than Google as a search
engine
that's not my experience my experience
is it doesn't know anything current
and it lies to you about other things
and when it does find something useful
all it did was Read Wikipedia
so as a search engine
do you know why it feels better than
Google right now
like I do get the impression that is
better because I've asked this some
simple stuff and I'm like oh I like that
it feels better because it doesn't have
advertisements
that's it the people are not gaming the
results and sticking advertisements in
there
but that's all
as soon as AI you know becomes mature
you're going to get the advertisements
and the fake results just like
everything else so it's only useful
because it's in beta as soon as they add
ads to it you're going to have to search
some images like Google
um I'm guessing
and I would also a number of people said
AI is already helping them
with writing tasks do you believe that's
true do you believe that people are
already using AI successfully for
writing
there
yeah and some people say yes they are
all right well I'm going to say
something that might be insulting to
some of you
AI will definitely be good for writing
so that's there's no doubt about it AI
is great for writing AI is going to make
bad writers average writers
would you agree with that and by average
I mean there's no grammar errors and you
know exactly what it says it's not great
it's just really serviceable it's got
utility does the job right so the AI
will make bad writers
normal and sufficient
what's it going to do to good writers
I don't believe it can become a good
writer
now again I know
I've got to close my eyes
because I know what you're saying all
right without reading the comments
you're saying Scott it's just the
beginning
right it's just the beginning
it'll get so much better
here's where I disagree
the thing that makes me a professional
writer
is that I can write a sentence you
wouldn't have thought of
just think about that that's why I'm a
professional writer and other people who
would like to be or not I could write a
sentence that you didn't expect
and you wouldn't have been able to write
on your own
AI
learns to write by looking at average
writers
that's how it learned it looks at a huge
body of average writers and that it
comes up with this sort of average thing
that it thinks everybody is going to
understand so AI is the dumbed down
writer
I think it'll be the greatest writing
tool for bad writers but it will never
it'll never do what a human writer can
do which is anticipate the next thing
that you want to care about or feel how
the room feels you read the room and
then the other thing I can do and I've
tested AI to see if I can write humor
it's not even close
AI always goes for the oldest joke
possible
so if you say hey AI write a funny
article on some topic you can guarantee
that the first joke an ordinary person
can think of it'll be there
it'll be there right if I told it to
raise some jokes about Biden's age
do you think it would have written the
uh that he knew James Madison personally
of course it would yeah the the very
joke that Biden used that he's so old
that he knew one of the framers of the
Constitution personally
have you ever heard that joke before
yes
yes you've heard that joke before like a
billion times
so if you ask AI to write a joke about
Biden's age it would write that joke and
it wouldn't be funny and it wouldn't be
any funnier than the human who probably
did write it right it's just the most
obvious joke so one of the things that
makes a commercial grade humorist
commercial grade is that we wouldn't do
that
I would never do that joke
because it's just so old and overdone
but so far AI just prefers I think AI
prefers things that most people are
familiar with
it's like all right everybody knows what
this means and this will not be
offensive the other thing AI can't do is
offend people
and know when to get away with it
right because they would never know when
it can get away with it a professional
humorist can offend people and that's
the funny part the funny part is knowing
that somebody was offended but you you
know which little pockets you can get
away with right because you soften that
by saying something else
or or you could
a human humorist can create a Persona of
themselves like Andrew Dice Clay
where when he said uh hugely uh let's
say I would say misogynistic sounding
stuff you wouldn't say to yourself hey
That Guy believes those things we must
cancel him you say oh I get it he's
playing the character of a guy who's a
misogynist and that he says funny things
as if a misogynist would say them and
then you go Ah that's funny
but AI can't do that because AI doesn't
know how to become Andrew Dice Clay and
if it did it would just look weird
yeah so I believe that AI
has logical barriers
that might be permanent
that keeps it from being a great writer
or a really funny one
and I think that we'll keep it that way
because we want it you don't want AI to
say things that would offend people
so it can never do humor
right AI can never do anything but Dad
jokes dad jokes will be like the limit
of it I mean it might do great dag jokes
but that'll be the limit of its
creativity it has to do you think AI
could write a joke that somebody has
never written before
I could argue that nobody does but
no I don't think so because the joke
form is always the same you could just
add different names and details to it
but it's the same joke
yeah
all right and what if uh AI does
self-deprecating humor
makes no sense does it if a human being
does a self-deprecating joke which is
one of the biggest you know fields of
humor you could laugh because they
created a stereotype of themselves
and then you know use that stereotype
but the AI can never create a stereotype
of itself
so if the AI did a self-deprecating joke
like well
you know uh I'd never get that one right
that would never be funny to you it
would just look like a broken machine
well why don't we get it right whereas
if a human makes a mistake sometimes we
think it's hilarious because we we read
our own experience into it
all right so here here's an example of a
joke that AI wrote for me
uh in my voice so I asked AI to write a
funny article about AI
but do it in my voice and his final joke
was you know blah blah blah but uh ai ai
is not in charge
yet
it
AI is not in charge of the world
yet that's the joke
now
I might have said that as
um
you know so interesting writing but not
as a joke you know it might be something
that makes the writing a little more
lively or something like that but no
look that is the oldest most obvious
joke in the world and I feel like AI
will always be limited to the oldest
most obvious cleanest non-offensive
non-self-deprecating
jokes and they can't use stereotypes
either
yeah most jokes are about stereotypes
and AI probably isn't allowed to do that
every time AI gives you an answer it
says well but you have to be aware that
not everybody fits The Stereotype like
well you just killed that joke
yeah AI is basically a summary of the
average that is true now let's talk
about coding
I have this theory that AI will make
code worse
here's why
suppose you're a programmer and you know
that there is some code available or you
could just tell AI to write it
at some point AI is going to write it
the same way every time won't they
because they could just see what other
AIS have done and it'll just figure out
that's just the best way to do it we'll
just write it that way if humans do it
and they don't know that something's
already written I feel like they would
start from scratch and say all right how
would I write this and they might learn
something in the process
they might accidentally create a thing
that was different when what they
thought and say oh that wasn't what I
thought but I could use that for
something else
so I feel as if you that AI will take
the creativity away from Human
programmers
initially for really good reasons
because they'll take the drudgery away
but I think it also will take away their
creativity
and I believe that a clever programmer
I here's a story I always think about
when I think about this now this is in
the hardware world but it works for
software as well when the original Apple
was being built
and it used too many chips or something
and then Steve Wozniak came in and
looked at it and said wait a minute I
could get rid of a whole bunch of these
chips and it will still be perfect and
they re-engineered it so it used at
least number of chips and that's kind of
what made the was that the not the Mac
was it the Mac but it but it made them
successful because it was a human whose
creativity allowed them to know that
they could make a more efficient version
I worry I think it was the Apple One
but I worry
that if everybody starts using the same
canned programs or Sai to make it and it
ends up making the same they will lose
all the Serendipity and accidental
discoveries and stuff that we have now
so it could make things worse by making
them all the same
just just the possibility you know the
unintended consequences of AI will be
the interesting ones
in a bad way
all right that ladies and gentlemen
is the conclusion of the best live
stream you'll see today
programmers can prompt aai to generate
code like they want but not necessarily
the same way they would have done it
that's the point
all right um
generative design is just that
uh
clear cutting for comics
oh yeah uh I got an answer from AI that
said that
AI was you know it wanted equity
so AI is already using Equity as its
preferred word do you think AI figured
that out on its own do you think that an
AI that was mostly trained on pre-2017
data picked up on Equity no that to me
looks like it was hard-coded that to me
looks like the finger of the programmers
saying uh-oh we can't have them say
equality
because that's not our story we better
make them use the word Equity whenever
this kind of topic comes out there's no
way in the world the AI the AI came up
with equity on its own
I don't believe that
I don't I mean it could it's not it's
not without it's not outside the realm
of possibility
yeah but it seems very unlikely
all right
um
discernment okay
uh yeah Glenn gridwell tweeted about
Rumble having a large young audience and
he thinks that something big is ahead
for Rumble but he does not say what I'm
a rumble shareholder so I should
disclose that
oh yeah Huffington Post is used as some
of the AI training data
what could go wrong
all right
um
the unsaturated of AI is available to
those who are not Elite okay
is there a chat on locals yeah locals
they're all chatting right now
locals looks just like I mean it looks
like this except on locals they can uh
insert memes and photos so so the chat
on locals is a lot more pictures
I don't know why it's funny that YouTube
doesn't have that feature
all right that ladies and gentlemen
uh concludes my presentation for today
YouTube thanks for joining I'll see you
see you tomorrow
