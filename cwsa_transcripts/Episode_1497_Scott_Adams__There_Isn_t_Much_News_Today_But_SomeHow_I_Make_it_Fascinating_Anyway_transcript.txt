good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with scott adams the best part
of
every single day
no matter what
and today it's a little bit of a slow
news day so i'm going to be taking some
questions toward the end see if
anybody's got anything on their mind
but
how could you make an ordinary day
special
well it might have something to do with
the simultaneous sip doesn't it yeah and
all you need is a cup of margarine
glasses take your child's steiner
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including
well pandemics
and it's it's going to happen now join
me go
oh i feel my spike proteins hardening
i don't know what that means
so let's see what's going on uh
brian stelter
made
news
i love the fact that the guy whose job
it is
to comment on the news
or comment on the people who are
commenting on the news which i think is
more what brian stelter does
uh that he becomes the news
you can't become the news if your job is
to comment on the people commenting on
the news and if you're a person
commenting on the people commenting on
the news
if you become the news
you're three layers away from
reality because you got the news
let's call that reality
then you got the people commenting on it
that's one level away from reality
and then you've got stelter who's
commenting on the people commenting on
the news usually talking about fox news
so he's two levels away from reality
and we're not even sure the reality was
real if you know what i mean
so he might be three levels away from
reality
but we're talking about him anyway so
what did he do
he said that talking about 911 yesterday
he said network tv anchors
were quote the closest thing that
america had to national leaders on 9 11.
they were the moral authority for the
country on that first day
especially with political leaders and
bunkers or otherwise out of sight
now
as somebody funny said on twitter i
forgot to write down the person's name
uh but
somehow brian stelter finds a way to
make everything about brian stelter
so the news the news has a
a great way of making everything about
themselves
well it was 9 11 but more importantly
what did brian stelter say
all right
uh
you know and the funny thing is
i don't even necessarily disagree with
the statement i mean obviously it's a
little bit of hyperbole
uh but they were the ones that were the
the face of the country in a sense
for a number of hours
but i would say that
leadership
takes many forms
and that
when 9 11 happened there was lots of
leadership
there was lots of lit maybe more than
we've ever had
except for maybe pearl harbor or
something
but i don't think there was ever more
leadership in this country
than not 911. it was just distributed
you know there was a fire you know the
fire professional
the police person
they all took responsibility
now what were they just doing a job
well it's doing a job if somebody's
telling you what to do
but if you have to figure out what to do
and you're making you know real-time
life and death decisions
it's leadership i mean you're basically
saying
i got to figure out what to do and then
go do it so i would say that leadership
was probably at an all-time high yeah
flight 43 perfect example
basically leadership was instantly
distributed
that's one of the things this country
does well maybe other countries do
but one of the things that we do well
is that we instantly
distribute leadership
so leadership was sort of sitting there
at the presidency or wherever you know
in its various leadership forums
but the moment the first tower got hit
who was in charge
well not really the president
right i mean didn't make any decisions
but the fire trucks were moving the
first responders were moving
so the leadership was at an all-time
high i would say it's just it was
distributed were the were the people who
were doing the news
part of that absolutely
and they were a visual part so
stealthers i think stelter's got a point
right it's one of those points that's
fun to argue with because it's it's not
an absolute so there's plenty of
exceptions
but did the uh
did the people who gave us the news that
day
were they displaying leadership i'd say
yes
no more than the rest of us i mean
everybody tried to figure out what they
could do
you know who they could help is there
somebody you know
some way we can donate you know drive
there and try to dig people out
so yeah lots of leadership
um
tragic story out of uh georgia the
georgia zoo
is treating 13 western lowland gorillas
who tested positive for cohen
displaying symptoms
and um
what they don't there's a lack of
context on this story of course so 13
gorillas all got coveted
but you know that's the bad news
um there was a control group
uh the raccoons
had zero cases of covet
no covet among the raccoons
but the gorillas 13 cases wow
why was it the raccoons didn't have any
uh any cases
oh wait
in the comments
why did the raccoons
have no cases
come on
do i thank you
the raccoons were wearing masks
that's right
the raccoons were wearing masks
now
i understand that there are some of you
in my audience
who don't like dad jokes as much as i do
what the hell is wrong with you
if you don't like dad jokes
we can't be friends
you could watch
but we won't hang out
because it turns out you would hate me
if you hung out with me because you
might hear a few dad jokes
might be a few
all right
tulsi gabbard made a little news today
so on the anniversary of 9 11
which this year fell on 9 11.
um
she noted that uh this is her quote she
said let us never forget
that it was the islamist ideology that
inspired the terrorist attacks and
declaration of war against america on 9
11. and it is this islamist
ideology
that continues to fuel terrorist attacks
around the world and
is the foundation for so-called
islamic countries like pakistan turkey
iran and saudi arabia's discriminatory
policy against christians hindus
buddhists
atheists etc
now
it's bad enough that according to tulsi
gabbard
that the islamic ideology
is discriminating against christians
hindus buddhists and atheists
that would be plenty bad
but they're also discriminating against
etc
and
that's a big group
etc
um
i've heard that the taliban will line up
the etc and just execute them
they'll say whoa
we got a christian here we got an
atheist we'll handle you
but look at those etc the etc are
bastards
line them up and take care of them
so never be in the et cetera category
you will surely be rounded up
now here's the thing that tulsi did
that's kind of clever and provocative
what she did not say
is that
islamic people are the problem
you got that right
what she did not say
is that islamic
people
are the problem
she said that islamic ideology is the
problem
almost as if
she's treating islamic ideology as
what what in the comments finish my
sentence
what is she treating islamic ideology
like by a virus a virus
exactly
that's right she's treating it like
a medical problem
a virus
is it a medical problem is mental health
a medical problem i think we would say
yes right i think we're at a point where
we say
mental health is a medical problem by
definition
so
if you had a islamic ideology
and that ideology
not the people people are all great
we're nothing about people here
we're talking about ideology
if the ideology
can cause problems
then is it fair to say there's something
wrong with the
ideology
think so i think that's fair so i think
that tulsa is both brave
and honest and completely accurate
because she specifies ideology had she
specified the religion or the people
that would be another comment altogether
so what do you do
about a virus
you can do what china does
social
separation
they put the uyghurs in
in camps and they separate them from the
rest of the public
they treat it exactly the way they're
treating the coronavirus social
isolation
and at force forced social isolation
now there's obviously no way that we
could do that but
if we don't understand
if we don't understand uh
islamic ideology
as a mental virus basically it's it's a
mental problem
yeah it's like a mental illness that
travels that travels like a virus you
can catch it from other people i just
want to see this comment from
uh
uh
there's what was your take on george w
speech yesterday was he referring to
january 6
when he was talking about domestic
terrorists
well if he didn't mention january 6
specifically
then probably not
um i didn't see the speech but i think i
think people were assuming he was
talking about january 6.
and
i don't think that we can ignore that
problem is there anybody thinks
is there anybody that thinks
we can ignore
that there's a domestic terror or threat
does anybody think that it's zero
i think it might be exaggerated
i don't know
because you know it would only take one
horrible attack and then we'd all say
well we were underestimating how bad it
was um
let's say
i'm just looking at some of your
comments
he was referring to himself
uh
yeah but do you think that there's a
domestic terrorism problem
do you think that's something that's on
our top i don't know 20 things to worry
about
yeah in terms of total impact on the
country it's probably pretty small
but if you happen to be in the building
where somebody comes in and starts
shooting you're not going to be happy
yeah okay
so um iran
apparently iran has agreed
with the let's see the
iaea the watchdog nuclear watchdog
group nuclear agency
um
that they're gonna let them service the
monitoring equipment
now when you see this story do you say
to yourself wow that's good news hey we
got some progress here it looks like
biden's going to pull pull this through
because wouldn't you be happy if iran at
least
was not building nuclear devices without
us knowing what they were doing
and it turns out that they say hey yeah
maybe we'd be open to
letting you service your monitoring
equipment
so good news right
we're going to be the
the countries of the world will be able
to
monitor their
nuclear stuff
and so this is a good sign that that
iran is moving in the right direction
right
looks all good everybody happy
yeah we have you are not monitoring
i'm reading uh reading that do you think
iran
would agree to allow the monitoring
devices to be repaired if the monitoring
devices were monitoring anything they
cared about
no
no this story
is the fakest of fake news because
nowhere in the story does it mention
that maybe we don't monitor the right
places
and i think that's the most important
part of the story is our how do we know
we're monitoring the right places if
they're going to let us fix the
monitoring equipment
obviously they're not worried about
those monitoring those monitors looking
at any secrets
so i'm not even sure this is anything
all right i provoca provocatively i
tweeted this morning
that if science ever concludes that
vaccinations are dangerous for young
boys specifically that group but nobody
else
we'd vaccinate them anyway
if the only group that was worse off and
by the way i'm not claiming this but
there's some pre-print studies showing
that
young boys uh get a little
myocarditis or some i don't enlarge
heart whatever it is so they get some
health problems
that are unusual
in the public
so in other words
they get hit by the vac the vaccine
itself might be more dangerous
in this case than the covet now we don't
know that
so that's not a claim
so don't
don't dig me for a false claim it's more
like a question that's out there with
some scary information that's making us
think it's a good question
i don't know what the answer is but it's
a good question so there's a preprint
paper that seems to show that young boy
is having more health problems from the
vaccination itself
than other people are
now
will that
will that study hold up will it be
duplicated
will it pass peer review
maybe don't know but it's not hasn't
been peer reviewed it's still in the
preprint phase and by the way
it's kind of it's kind of useful isn't
it
that the pandemic taught us all you know
the rest of the public what a preprint
publication is
because i'm not sure everybody knew that
before right and still not everybody but
a lot of us at least understand
that something is a pre-print
study
the amount of credibility you should
give it
needs to come way way way down right
and if in your mind you're saying well
sure it's a pre-print but there's an 80
chances right nope
nope it's not even close to 80
i don't know what it is
but i wouldn't be thinking it's most
likely true
it might be closer to a coin flip or
even less really
so if you hear there's a pre-print paper
think coin flip
that's about
roughly the right you know risk
the right probability because about half
of all
peer-reviewed papers get rejected they
don't hold up over time so if if even
half of peer-reviewed papers are a
problem
imagine one that hasn't been
peer-reviewed
right it's not going to be better
it's not going to be better it's going
to be less than 50
now i think the 50 might have been
uh
on
less hard science
i think the pandemic would be a little
bit
more objective science you know hard
science and some of that some of the
behavioral studies are the ones that are
questionable especially
all right
so what if it turns out that it's true
so it's just a what if that young boys
are worse off if they get vaccinated
again
that's not established
but what if it's true what if it ends up
being true
i think we would vaccinate them anyway
because
boys have the lowest value in society
if it were girls
do you think we would treat it the same
if young girls were the ones who looked
like the ones who had had risks from the
vaccination
no
now we'd stop everything
because girls are biologically more
valuable and at the moment in this point
in time 2021 they're socially more
valuable
i'll just say it out loud
boys have the lowest value in
american society at the moment that was
probably different when i grew up et
cetera but at the moment is true um
i see jewel adora's agreeing with me i
appreciate that
yeah and
there's a reason that boys go to war
and girls do not
because biologically
the girls slash women are the only ones
who could have babies
and so they're more valuable to
reproduction it doesn't take many men to
impregnate a lot of women we're happy to
do the work
uh you know if there's a shortage of
men to impregnate the women
i think the remaining men would step up
and maybe put a little extra effort into
that impregnating work
so
you could always uh
you could always have too many men
and it's one of the reasons i think wars
are almost um evolutionarily
necessary to drain off the extra men
because it's just too many of them
but we don't have any kind of process to
drain off extra women
you know that that never evolved
because you don't want to do that but
yeah you have all kinds of
things that would drain off the extra
men you got your you know your extreme
sports will go kill ourselves that way
you got your your reckless driving we do
more of that you got your wars you got
your violence you got your prisons
so we have all these systems for taking
men out of the system because there are
too many of them but there's nothing
like that for women
um
so just
that's that's just a mess with your
minds a little bit to tell you that if
we get to the point where vaccinating
boys is bad for the boys
but maybe it's the only way you can get
to herd immunity
we would kill the boys
in a heartbeat if you said well we're
going to save a bunch of adults and a
bunch of women
but the cost of that is we're going to
kill some extra boys
we just do it
and you know what
i don't even disagree with it
i want to
because i used to be a young boy
right i would love to disagree with that
and say no
you will not put this burden unfairly on
young boys
that's all we got
we have a system in which young boys are
essentially just fodder
for a lot of different things we throw
young boys in all kinds of danger
this is just another one
right it's just another one
ken says wow scott i disagree strongly
uh and i and i respect that i think this
is a topic in which disagreement is
is
fully worthy of respect
i just put it out there as a provocative
thought you can wrestle with a little
bit
so
there's a video on facebook uh adam
dopamine was pointing to this in which
he thought there was some cognitive
dissonance going on in which a cnn
uh reporter was talking to a trump
supporter
and asking this uh
trump supporter about uh was she asking
vaccinations and
stuff like that i think the trump
supporter part was irrelevant to the
story the relevant part was and in fact
i don't even know if they said she was a
trump supporter i just i think i
intuited that but
uh it was uh mary
quintanilla
and
the cnn person challenges her on some of
her posts and points out that they've
been fact-checked to be false
now as
adam dopamine pointed out are we seeing
cognitive dissonance
from mary quintanilla because after the
cnn person points out that her
her posts have been debunked
instead of saying oh wow i didn't know
that that they've been debunked i will
immediately research that and possibly
change my opinion
you'd say oh that would be a
person whose brain is operating
correctly
but
what if she just digs in
further
well that feels like cognitive
dissonance cognitive dissonance is when
when you you are revealed
to be inconsistent in other words you're
you're not thinking right
you will you will torture your reality
until it all fits together and makes you
look like you're rational even though
you're not
so you will imagine
spontaneously just spontaneously a false
belief will pop up
of why you do what you do
so
once once the cnn guy had said okay this
is all debunked
are you still going to go with it even
though it's completely debunked
instead of saying oh okay now it's
debunked i'll change my mind
she
argued to keep it
is that cognitive dissonance
well if you wait all the way to the end
of the video
and it's where the payoff is it's all
it's the complete end of the video
where she explains her philosophy
that uh reality we have to deal with it
as a subjective entity
because
we can't tell what's real
because the fact checkers
are no longer credible
boom
[Laughter]
boom
she's talking to the fact checker
cnn and telling him yeah that would be a
great idea to take your fact checking
and then revise my opinion except
you're not a credible source
and she's right
now i don't think she's necessarily
right about her posts you know i don't
agree with her posts
i'm i haven't seen them all i'm just
assuming i wouldn't agree with them
but is she right that the fact checkers
can't help her
and her own research isn't going to help
her necessarily except to get to a
subjective opinion she basically said in
straight language
that her own research would not get her
to truth
it would get her to a subjective truth
and it's the best she can do
and so i'm watching this and i'm saying
to myself
is this an example of a you know some
let's say unsophisticated person
who doesn't know the difference between
truth and reality because that's how
cnn presented it or is it somebody
operating at a higher level of reality
because the higher level of reality is
to understand that we don't know
the things we think we know
and she said that directly
she directly made a statement at a
higher level of awareness than than the
reporter and the reporter couldn't
recognize it
because the record the reporters
operating at a
lower
level of reality the reporter thinks
that the fact check means something
or that we should be convinced by it
that's kind of a low level of reality
right now it was
it seemed like a higher level of reality
i don't know 10 years ago
10 years ago i always said uh if you're
not doing the fact checking or at least
finding it a little bit credible there's
something wrong with you
but now i think in 2021 it's a perfectly
reasonable statement to say the fact
checking is
there is no way to know what's true
that feels pretty close to true like a
fair statement and so
this is a lovely story
of either a
miss mary quintanilla operating at a
higher level of awareness than cnn
or the opposite
you get you get to pick your movie on
this one
um but to me it looked like she's
at least somewhere in that ambiguous
area
all right i was thinking today
that think of all the things that trump
has been criticized for
it's everything right
just everything
i don't think trump has been criticized
for
um you know
i mean he's been criticized more ways
and from more angles than anybody's ever
been criticized in the history of
criticism
but here's weirdly a criticism that he
either doesn't get or if he does it
doesn't stick
it goes like this
is he sincere
in his love for working americans you
know not the elite
but is he sincere
in his love
love
l-o-v-e capital l
it's not even it's not even lowercase l
you know the the claim would be
that he loves the working class with all
capital letters and
that every single thing he's ever done
in his entire life
is consistent with that
everything
i don't think i've ever seen him
questioned on that point
and it makes me it makes me think of the
definition of charisma
the best definition of charisma i ever
saw i forget who came up with it but the
definition is power plus empathy
so empathy in this case would be a love
for the
working class and and a
a clear willingness to help
does that describe trump
now forget about your cynical thoughts
about you know what somebody's really
thinking or why they're thinking it just
in terms of does the working class
believe
that trump is completely on their side
at least a lot of them
and at the same time
that he has power
he has the ability to do something and
he's on their side
now you could argue oh he didn't do
enough but he tried like hell
he tried like hell i i saw in the
comments he didn't get the wall built
true
true statement he promised to build the
wall
he did not build a wall
but dear lord he tried hard
he tried harder than anybody's ever
tried has anybody ever come close
to trying that hard right in front of
you while you watched no
nobody's ever come close
now it did work but do you doubt that he
was trying to build that wall for the
benefit of the working class i mean he
would imagine that it would help
everybody who's american but
yeah i mean he got it he got it going
but it didn't work out
so i think it's
again sort of the dog not barking
because trump gets criticized for
everything
everything
he is criticized for everything but he's
never been
touched
on the most important question
which is does he love the actually love
with capital letters
the working class
think of another politician who could
uh be this clean on the biggest question
because why is it that anybody would
vote for him
is this
it's this
he actually cares and he has capability
he has energy and capability that's what
you want
so i don't think there's any mystery to
why trump is popular
is there
you know you could look at his policies
all day long but as long as as the
working class feels bonded to him
and by the way that makes me feel bonded
to him not because i'm working class
but because
i'm bonded to the working class too
that's those are my roots
anybody who has roots in the working
class is going to be bonded to it right
so i'm bonded to the working class he
looks like a hero to the working class
and even if i'm not in the you know
quote working class right now i'm closer
to the elite
uh i'm still bonded to that population
all right
um
yeah trump's also more popular among
non-college educated people and all that
just makes sense
so the cnn is saying that republican
leaning
folks are saying they prefer trump to be
the nominee in the next election
63 percent
say you should be the leader of the
republican party
uh but they're about evenly split over
uh whether that would help the party or
not
they want him
but they're not entirely sure it's the
best strategy
i think that's pretty reasonable isn't
it
a lot of times you see a poll
and you say to yourself that's crazy
how are so many people getting the wrong
idea but this feels this feels right in
the pocket
you know two-thirds of the public ish
thinks trump should be the nominee that
feels about right
and they're about evenly split over
whether that's a good idea
they want it
but they're not sure it's a good idea
that's exactly where i'm at
you know i would love to see him as the
nominee for a number of reasons
entertainment being close to the top
but i don't know if it's a good idea
do you
because the trouble is
his effectiveness is what causes all the
trouble
i mean you could say it's his
provocation and the way he talks and
that's part of it but if he didn't if he
were not effective
could actually couldn't actually change
anything
then nobody would care
scott have you considered this is the
second act
yes i have
yes i have
what would be the the
trump third act
if this were a movie what would be the
third act
the part where all is lost and there's
you know you're dead
the third act would be when he lost
reelection
i mean you could make a lot of third
acts out of this but if it turns out
that trump loses reelection
but somehow comes back and wins
you have to make a movie out of this
i mean it just has to be a movie
and there's so many great ways you could
make a movie out of this by the way if
you made a movie about the
trump experience
you would need
i think you would need some characters
in it who are not just the politicians
so you would need some ordinary people
to you know to really give the character
of the movie
who would be the best
the best character who would was not
trump himself
to be in a trump movie that would give
you like a really good sense of it
who would that be
oh cerdovich
that's a good one
yeah
i think i would be in that conversation
actually
because as an observer
um i think i observed him correctly from
the beginning so if i were writing the
movie
i would put cernovich in it
and i would put me in it
and you know jack pasabic i put i put a
half a dozen people who are
who saw it early
the people who saw it early and knew why
he was going to
prevail
i think that's the angle that makes it
the most interesting because yeah joel
pollock be another one
uh ann coulter would be in it of course
yeah and i think it would be interesting
that way but if you had to pick one of
those who would it be
just one of those characters i don't
know
but uh cernovich would be a heck of a
good choice
i think i'd be a good choice just
and i'm not bragging because in this
case it's just
who was where when i mean doesn't have
anything to do with my skills
but i think it was an i had a weird
vantage point on this that would be an
interesting movie
movie point of view
all right
um
what do you think
let me ask you
do you think trump is going to be
president again
in the comments
will tr give me your prediction will
trump be president again
i'm looking at the
locals as a faster response time
i'm seeing uh
way more yes's than those
actually it looks about the same as a it
looks about two-thirds yes and
uh over on
so this is interesting so difference in
the audience on youtube i'm seeing more
now
but a lot of guesses too
yeah i think we're i think your
responses are pretty much like the pole
about two-thirds yes
somebody says desantis is a wild card
desantis is a wild card only in one
sense
he's only relevant if trump doesn't run
if trump runs desantis doesn't have a
chance of getting the nominee i don't
think i think trump would just walk
right into it
but
uh if trump didn't run
desantis isn't
certainly in the top three of people you
would consider
i think tom cotton's got to be in the
conversation
let me ask you this
we'll throw out this name uh i probably
have more
or right leaning audience even though
i'm not personally right-leaning
but
um
how what do you think of tom cotton i
just
just that give me give me a tom cotton
flash opinion
um
too young
somebody says too boring
yeah a bit cold
uh
too neoconish somebody says
not charismatic enough
big balls i agree with that one
truthful
no charism no charisma
well
if you say he has no charisma why are we
talking about him
i mean why is he in the top three of
names that you think of
for president if he doesn't have
charisma
i don't think
i'm not sure that uh that's a fair
comment
i think he does have charisma
um
but we also haven't seen him in a
full presidential
mode because you know people can take on
a different personality a little bit
so if he takes for example al gore
al gore seemed a little uh stiff
but he loosened up during the campaign a
little bit did his best
not completely
anyway um i'm a very pro tom cotton
uh if trump doesn't run
because um he's
he's strong on opposing china and i
think that's our biggest challenge and i
haven't seen him being completely wrong
on too many topics or anything that i
can think of actually
so he seems reasonable and patriotic and
i like
i like where his brain ends up on a lot
of stuff
um
yeah picking cotton would just sound
funny yeah
you know it's not a joke
i don't think that black people will
vote for a man named cotton
that's not a joke
you you think that like okay haha they
know it's just his name they're not
gonna
vote against him because his name is
cotton
no they will
they just won't know it
it's one of those things that would be
that a little bit of thing in the back
your head that causes you to think
there's some other reason you're not
voting for
uh don't take a good senator out of the
senate well
unless he could be replaced easily
um
super bubble says i'm black and don't
like him
but why
yeah why haven't they fired any generals
yet i'm seeing that comment there why
have no
no
um let me give you a little update of
something that happened locally i'm not
going to name the the business
all right so i'm going to talk about a
a retail establishment
that i happen to visit the other day and
for reasons that i also won't mention it
was super crowded
so it was an indoor space
in which people were
you know just bumped up against each
other like a party
zero masks
zero now we have full mask mandate for
indoor stuff the employees all had masks
on
zero people had mass in the
establishment
why
the answer was that there were too many
people without masks
if one person isn't wearing a mask
you can imagine the staff would say oh
do you notice everybody's wearing masks
you know put on a mask or we'll have to
ask you to leave
but
if you have a hundred people without
masks
you're done
you're done and a hundred people without
masks walked in and walked in the door
and then they just said all right what
do you want to buy and then they just
sold it to them
100 people
no masks
now it wasn't really civil of
disobedience
it was just young people and they saw
other people without mass and they just
did the same
so
here's the thing that you can't predict
the tipping point
right
because there is a tipping point where
that where enough people will show up
without masks for any given situation
that it can't be
it just can't be uh
you know enforced
so the only way it can be enforced is if
only a few people
don't wear masks as soon as you get to i
don't know what 10
20
if you had
consistent 20
people
just not wearing a mask and making a
thing out of it you know making you make
them throw throw you out of the business
it's too much it would overwhelm any
enforcement capability
so about to 10 20 disobedience and it's
all done
how close are we
to a 10 disobedience
probably always pretty close
right at the moment it looks like people
are completely compliant i mean 99 right
and
it makes you think
that it would take a lot
for that 99 compliance to even waiver
because it's just so solid
99 of people do wear masks where they're
told to wear masks
but
10 is all it would take for the whole
thing to fall apart i feel like we're
closer to 10 percent
than we think
and at the moment there is just enough
trust and good will in the country
and people don't want to be the one to
cause trouble
that
we're barely limping by
with this masked mandate stuff
but it could it could fall apart in a
heartbeat
uh big stores in westchester new york
have 10 no
mass we're getting there
uh
you know the the sign that would make
the mask problem go away if you put it
on your retail establishment would be
and i'm saying this in the comments the
sign would say masks are mandated by the
state
they did not provide resources for
enforcement
how about that
masks are mandated by the state we ask
you to wear a mask
the state has not provided us with any
resources for enforcement
and you're done
because those are just true statements
it's required we ask you to wear them
they gave us no resources for
enforcement
you don't you don't have to tell people
what to do
they're going to figure it out pretty
quickly
um
all right i'm gonna take some questions
because as i said today's a little bit
of a slow news day we're we're thinking
backwards uh this week to 9 11.
so let's think forwards a little bit
does anybody have any predictions they'd
like me to go out on limb for or any
any clarifications or
complaints about anything i've said
how does trump overcome the persuasion
that he's a racist if he runs again well
it didn't stop him from winning last
time
you know there there's so many things
that could change
what happens in 2024 and probably a lot
of them will happen between now and then
one of those things is what happens if
one of the audits finds out there is a
problem
that that's like a gigantic wild card
isn't it
because between now and 2024
i feel like we'll know for sure
if any audit found any big problems
what if they do or what if they don't
well if they don't find any big problems
it's going to be hard for trump to win
because his claim was
there were big problems
and if we haven't found any in four
years
it's not going to look very credible
and i think that's really going to work
against them especially with the january
6th thing hanging over his head
but what if
and i'm not i'm predicting this won't
happen by the way but what if
they find it
let me ask you this a direct question
under the hypothetical
possibility
that i
that i predict won't happen but let's
say does
and there's some massive fraud found in
one of the key states
trump
possibly lose
under that scenario
i don't think so
i think he would just walk into the
presidency
what do you think i think that if if
some shenanigans were identified they
were of scale you know big enough they
could have made a difference
i think he will walk into the presidency
because under that situation january 6
looks completely different doesn't it
what does january 6 look like
if you're sure that the election was
fair
looks like an insurrection
doesn't it
even if you're on trump's side
if you thought the election was fair
then the people trying to change the
result
they look a little insurrectiony don't
they
but what if you knew
let's say hypothetically some audit
found some big problems what's it look
like then
it doesn't look like an insurrection
does it
it looks like a bunch of patriots
stopping in insurrection
do you know why it would look like that
because it would be
that's exactly what it would be if we
find that that the protesters on january
6 were right
and it was a stolen election
it's not an insurrection
it's stopping an insurrection
and that would happen instantly the
moment the moment you knew that that the
facts were different than presented
it would immediately turn into a
different situation
let me put it this way what would happen
hypothetically
hypothetically what would happen if we
found out that the election was stolen
and we had a whole bunch of prosecutions
for serious crimes i mean people
you know
injuring police officers or some serious
crimes
i would
i would pardon all of them
if i could
yeah if we find out the election was
stolen
i think every one of the
insurrectionists even the ones who did
violence
even the ones who did violence
i think they all have to be pardoned
but that's a big standard and i don't
think we'll reach it so my prediction is
we will not find a massive fraud i'm not
saying it wasn't there i just don't
think we'll find any
um
what if there are prosecutions for the
russian hoax
i think that's
too much in our
our rear view mirror at this point
um
there's another scott belief yes
midterm prediction
well the trouble with the midterms is we
still don't know if the voters have any
impact
it might be just the rule changes that
matter
you know in the same way that
gerrymandering is the only thing that
matters
uh in many cases
so it's not really the voters who make
much difference so if the voters made a
difference i would think that the 2022
election would go for the republicans
but if the voters don't make any
difference
because i don't know elections are
rigged or gerrymandering or anything
else
then things stay about the same
all right
let's see if only many yeah
mark twain said if voting made any
difference they wouldn't let us do it
uh what's your options once you
recognize somebody who's having
cognitive dissonance what are your
options
i don't know that anybody's ever solved
that
once somebody is triggered into
cognitive dissonance
it's like you're talking to an insane
person
you know any facts or anything just
they'll just bounce off
so usually when cognitive dissonance
happens
you just have to walk away
now i never do that
instead what i do is i point out the
person's cognitive dissonance and
explain what the trigger was and how i
don't have a trigger
so if you're wondering if i'm the one
with the cognitive dissonance
you can look to see what triggers
cognitive distance so you can see i
don't have any
but you can see that you do
that's the best you can do do you think
that that causes people to say oh you
know that's a good point now that you've
you've taught me how to spot cognitive
dissonance i can clearly see that i had
a trigger
and so i got triggered into it whereas
you had no trigger and so therefore
presumably you were not
has anybody ever said that to me
nope
no they just get angry
because they're pretty sure they don't
have cognitive dissonance
scott has some dissonance on certain
topics you should assume that to be true
yeah of course
you explain it worked on you really
somebody says that worked on them
sound quality is my trigger yeah
all right
uh does tulsi run again in 2024 and if
so what party i don't know
running for president seems to be good
for her
and i think people like her like her
voice to be part of the mix
so i think a lot of it has to do with
the fact that just both people on the
left and the right
have support for her so she's she's a
unicorn like that
i saw the latest
polls say that
the recall isn't going to work
so apparently
newsome has so much support in
california that
it went from looking like a close race
to not so close now i don't know if the
polls are right they could be
suppression polls
but
we'll see
um
let's see
tulsi yeah
um i'm just looking at some of your
comments that's why i'm being quiet here
are you a refugee in uh
cyprusia
okay
all right i know this part is not
entertaining because when you're just
watching me read comments
you're sitting there saying where's my
entertainment damn it
why is poetry persuasive i didn't think
it was
did i evoke break my not voting rule for
the recall election no no i haven't
voted in years
micro lesson on mentoring
okay i can do that
uh yeah i guess
yang is starting a new party i read
i don't know the details of that
uh vax shedding i haven't heard of that
yeah if the glove fits you must acquit
rhymes are
are persuasive but not poetry in its
large form
all right um yeah i see some some
requests for mentoring
tips how to get a mentor
and i will do that
um why not vote third party it's a waste
of time
the future of bitcoin
you know i don't know if anybody's good
at predicting the future stuff but i i
would just say this i think bitcoin has
gone from a speculative asset to an
asset
so
if you're looking at your whole
portfolio
and you're a certain age
i think it doesn't make sense to not
have crypto in your portfolio
so i i have some and that had crypto at
various times but i think we're talking
about you know something in the five
percent range
uh if you have more than that i feel
like you're getting ahead of the risk
reward
curve a little bit
but no doubt people have gotten rich
doing exactly the opposite of what i
just told you to do but if you want to
play conservative
which i recommend diversification is the
only thing that ever makes sense
so
uh
you're woefully uninformed on which
topic
i i don't think you're wrong by the way
over on youtube somebody says i'm
woefully uninformed that's just true of
everybody
so i accept that i embrace that comment
as 100 true
um
gold uh i've never wanted to own gold
even in the context of a
diversification
because i don't think gold can go to the
moon
but crypto can
so it for the same amount of risk crypt
well let me all right let me say this
here's something i've never said in
public before
for the same amount of risk
um
crypto has a bigger upside because that
you know the the crypto could just keep
growing but gold has sort of a
a little bit of a natural
limit because you know you can only use
it for so many things
there's only so much of it you know i
don't know
at least with bitcoin you can keep you
know taking smaller fractions of it
forever
um
is that because gold is physical yet the
physical element of gold puts a limit on
its upside potential yes
that would be one one of the things
um
where is warp speed for rapid tests well
in a sense we have rap warp speed for
rapid tests so let me give biden some
credit
biden did what i think
trump failed at and i don't use the f
word
about trump too often
right because i'm i'm more
pro his policies than not but when it
came to the rapid testing stuff the the
government under trump
was silent about it
which to me seemed like a gigantic
failure if not an evidence of corruption
i don't mean trump himself but some
corruption in in the administration
uh but biden is apparently doing the
what is it the
military
powers act or something
so he can basically force private
industry to make more of these tests and
i imagine
they're subsidizing
so he's war powers war powers act right
so biden is using that and that's uh oh
defense i'm sorry defense production act
thank you for correcting that it's the
defense production act
and biden is using it
trump should have
i don't know what changed you know
unless there's some improvement in the
quality of the test or something
but
i i think that was
probably the biggest mistake trump made
is not pushing hard on rapid testing and
if biden is getting that right
and he might be i mean he's certainly
putting effort into it the right way
um
i think you're going to say that's a
clean win for biden and a clean failure
for trump
there are a lot of those
you know i wouldn't say there are too
many of those but that's a big one
based on what we know now there might be
other information because we're not like
fully informed on what's going on there
but from the surface it looks like a
gigantic biden win
and a gigantic trump failure
but i would be open to an argument that
there's something i don't know about
that situation
yeah i'm hearing somebody say that
having too many rapid tests
would make it look like the infection is
worse maybe because more people would
get tested i don't know but that's not a
good enough reason
um
economy will collapse soon because
there's too much cash in the system
you know the one thing that you can
predict about the economy and you'll be
right every time there's only one thing
you can predict about it and no you will
be right you can't predict it
that's it you can't predict it
most people who are smart would say well
we put so much cash into the system
it has to collapse
but it should have collapsed already
like it should have we should have all
been dead a long time ago for some
reason and i'm not sure anybody
understands it totally
national debt
especially when you're in nuclear power
doesn't seem to be the same as personal
debt
it operates differently and we don't
know exactly where it can go or how bad
it can get
but if you have nuclear weapons
you don't always have to pay back your
bills
so we'll see
if somebody says they'll get the vaccine
if i personally inject them
challenge accepted
i've never given anybody an injection
but it would be kind of funny to stick a
needle into somebody's arm
i don't think that's legal
but
if it's legal
i'll come give you a jab you might not
like it
um will i get a booster i will wait till
the last minute
so that i have the most correct
information
so telling you in advance whether i'd
get one wouldn't make sense
what kind of a decision would that be
because in advance i don't have as much
information as i'll have later
so since i was late to get vaccinated i
waited also to get as much information
and other people's problems known as
possible i'll just do the same thing
with the booster so at the moment my
immunity should be at a peak
because of when i got the second
shot so i think i'm at my peak right now
of immunity uh six months from now
yeah i'd probably look at the boost
but i'll know more by then
um
yeah wait until your antibodies drop
right
why doesn't biden mandate anybody
getting federal money must be vaccinated
i don't know is that an option
uh will you antibody test first
oh that's a good question i
um
i think the antibody test
i don't know can you just get one
can you just request an antibody test
i'd have to know more about that if it's
possible and you can get them on demand
maybe
but oh yeah no i'll probably get the
booster just for social reasons
my wife has to take a vaccine against
her will or lose her job what would you
do quit or take the jab against your
judgment
i would i would take the jab
now
so here let me restate that question so
the question is if your employer says
you have to get the shot or you're fired
what do you do
if you if your conviction is you don't
want the shot
i told you what i would do
i would get the shot
why
because i always take the money decision
so people ask me hey i've got this uh
opportunity for a job that would pay
more
what should i do
i always say take the job
because it pays more
i had a friend who said you know two
ways to calculate my taxes which way
should i calculate i think they're both
legal
which way should i calculate it and i
say
calculated the way that you paid the
least amount of taxes i learned that
from somebody else by the way
um
yeah the the thing that you can measure
with certainly
is the job
the part you don't know anything about
is the risk
so if you have one thing that definitely
matters
a job
and you have another thing that i don't
know i can't really compare these two
risks the risk of getting the
vaccination versus the risk of the covid
both under one percent
so if you have two
unfathomable risks both way under one
percent
but you have this big looming honking
real world thing called your job
and your paycheck
i would make all of my decision based on
the real parts the job
and the paycheck that's the part you
know
and that matters
the part you don't know is a risk that's
so far under one percent
that you should just ignore it
now i would love to know what happens
when you tell your wife that
because
that's more a decision about how to make
decisions
she should put her own her own opinions
into that framework but how you make the
decision
is to ignore anything that's a tiny risk
and you're comparing it to some other
tiny unknown risk that you can't
possibly calculate for you
specifically so in those those cases
always favor the thing that is real
and also big
your job
now could that advice get you killed
did i just kill some guy's wife
maybe
maybe
and you shouldn't talk in public if you
can't take that chance
you know one of the risks of what i do
is i could actually kill somebody
but you have to you have to be you have
to be comfortable with that
um
all right
get the jab keep the job yeah it's
jabber job
are you the first one to realize that
it's jab or job
i feel like that's going to be a bumper
sticker
did you get the jab or the job
um
all right pompeo for president
i don't know if you you know i don't
dislike pompeo
uh he's a smart guy
i don't know if he's got quite the
charisma or something
maybe he does
he trimmed up
did
did trump lose weight by the way
because he does look young or i don't
know did he have some work done or
something he looks younger i think jack
bosovic noted this that he actually
looks younger
he does right
you lost 15 pounds you wouldn't even
notice 15 pounds
did you decide not to use the name dill
dog for dog burp
or was it pressure
i made that decision myself
um
you lost 30 pounds in the last nine
months good on you
okay on the here's my last question of
the day okay
i'm going to ask you if during the
pandemic
you
lost weight or gained weight
so that you can give me the numbers if
you know them but just say lost or
gained let's see what we did
and i'm going to make a prediction
that the locals platform lost more
weight than the
youtube let's let's watch
all right on locals you can't see it if
you're watching on youtube
tons of people lost weight
but also lots of people gained
lost 90 pounds
really
30 pounds 20 pounds 10 pounds 15. these
are lost
down 30 down 30
lost 12. this is all in the locals
platform by the way looking over on the
youtube
lost 25
lost
lost 20 lost
jesus
i'm sorry i know you don't like it when
i
use that word
holy cow
i feel like i need to give you a
standing ovation
and i think i will
i think i will
damn
damn standing ovation
there's all those people
who lost weight during the pandemic
lost weight
during a pandemic
[Applause]
full respect
i'm down a few pounds
but i'm usually in the same range i
don't change too much um
so
all right
fixed your back
kb did
how'd that happen
i i don't want to ask
um
did they get less junk food though maybe
maybe all right that's all i got for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
