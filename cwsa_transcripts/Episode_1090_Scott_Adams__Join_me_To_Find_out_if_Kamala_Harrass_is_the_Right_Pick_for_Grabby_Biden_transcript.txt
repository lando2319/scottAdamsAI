[Music]
hey
anything happened yesterday that uh
would be of interest to me
[Laughter]
oh yes it did well you may have missed
my
celebratory little periscope that i did
last night
after my prediction came in but this is
the one that matters
this is the periscope you wanted to be
at
yeah because this one has something
called the simultaneous sip
it makes everything better and all you
need is a copper marker glass of tanker
jealous or stein a candy jugger flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better including predictions
join me now go
so good so good well did you hear the
news
joe biden picked camalleris
don't call her camelot no no no
she's not camelot she's kamala we must
all learn to
pronounce it properly it's not
kamala it's not camelot
it's not a lot it's not
kamala it's kamala
and you should say that right otherwise
it's disrespectful as
as i guess tucker found out last night
which was pretty funny uh when when
tucker was pronounced
was corrected on the pronunciation of
her name
by a guest tucker said who cares
all right let's talk about what's going
on here
number one how many of you have read my
book
win bigly in which i talked about the
election in 2016 and predicting trump
would win
well if you did you would know that
there's an odd little
claim in that book a very odd little
claim and it goes like this
and once you hear this it's hard to
unhear it
you can't tell the difference between a
good prediction
and something you caused because
sometimes you can cause your prediction
to come true
now i'll just put this out here
i'm not saying that i caused kamala to
be selected as vice president
i'll just put this out there
if anybody read my book win bigly who
happened to be a democrat
well first of all is it likely that any
influential democrats would have read my
book
win bigly annie
probably it's a big country you'd expect
some people to check out any kind of
book
that talked about influence and
persuasion in the concept in the context
of an election
if you are an election professional if
you're an
advisor to any candidate would you be
tempted to look at a book
that taught you how to do it better
which indirectly
when bingley does probably
well if all you were doing is you know
even researching what the other side is
thinking
you'd probably come across that book and
that's where i talk about prediction
and and causing something looking the
same
and the question is
when i said that kamala would be the
strongest
choice did that make any difference
was there anybody on the democrat side
who said you know we can't tell who the
strongest choice is
but that guy over there who got some
things right before
he thinks kamal harris is the strongest
choice
could that influence their decision
don't know that's why i don't make the
claim
i'm just making the interesting claim
that they
look the same and you can't sort them
out so it's entirely possible
that i might have been inadvertently
part of the process
of the decision making where they said
you know we can't tell the difference
they all look good to us
but but why are they so scared of kabul
harris
it's possible i don't make the claim i
just put it out there
so i think what you're seeing is what i
call the double puppet maneuver
i don't know if we've ever seen a double
puppet maneuver before
but the double puppet maneuver oh you
want to say it don't you
let me give you a moment once you hear
something like double puppet maneuver
you have to kind of say it out loud
because you saw how
good it felt when i said it double
puppet maneuver
yeah take some time say it at home it'll
feel good
and it works like this the first puppet
of course
is that uh hollow joe will become the
puppet of
a stronger vice president and it's very
unusual to have a vice president who's
stronger than the top of the ticket
in fact is it the only time has it ever
happened before
have we ever had a vice presidential
candidate
who basically everyone on both sides
looked and said
okay the vice president is a little
stronger than the top of the ticket
have we ever had that i think it's the
first time
so so biden is the first puppet
and kamala has her hand up his little
puppet innards but here's the double
puppet part
yeah i said it double puppet part and
the question is who has their hand up
kamala harris's
back is she her own candidate
or are there powerful people behind her
who are playing the long game and
expecting that she's going to be the
power
and that backing her will pay off in the
long run
and who are those people behind the
curtain
well we do know that um
harris apparently inherited a lot of
campaign
people from the hillary clinton
world and she's probably got some obama
people who back her as well
so do you know who the president would
be
if biden and harris won
nope oh dick cheney thank you yes
you make a good point dick cheney was
possibly the power behind bush
but i would still say that bush was you
know
even on his own he was a powerful
character in fact
i tell this story before
bush jr ran for office i was giving a
speech in texas
and one of the other speakers i think
the one before me
uh was or after me i can't tell i can't
remember but it was george bush and he
was when he was governor
and one minute after he started speaking
you could feel the energy in the room
and it was not the energy
of a governor talking to people in in
their state george bush
the younger had that
he had the thing you know if you were in
the room
before he was running for president you
knew he was going to be president
all right you can feel it you know i
just sat there and thought i'm seeing
the next president here
now i wasn't a big supporter i'm just
saying that you could feel it
sitting in the room you knew he was
going to be president
it was almost it was almost palpable you
could just you could almost see it like
the future it was just so obvious
when he walked in the room and you
either have that thing or you don't
you know obama had it bill clinton had
it so
although it is true that cheney may have
been the
power behind the throne it is
nonetheless true that
uh that bush the younger he had he had
the goods
when it comes to how the public sees him
um but anyway let's talk about the
double puppet
i would say that hillary clinton found a
way to be president
yeah you're singing in the comments
you're ahead of me yeah it looks like
the clinton operation if you will call
it
you know it doesn't have to be an
organized thing but you know there is a
connection of people who have common
interests and connections to the
clintons
etc and so the biden
candidacy looks a lot like a double
puppet maneuver
with hillary clinton or or at least that
machine
being more influential than you think
that they ought to be
now let's talk about how the
democrats and especially their pet press
is dealing with us so now this is sort
of a challenge
for the anti-trump you know pro-biden
media how are they going to treat
kamala harris will they treat her
harshly no
no they won't treat her harshly they
will
put a warm embrace around her do you
think
that they have all coordinated their
messages
well it would be a surprise if they
hadn't
if if cnn's you know universe of
punditry if they have not talked
directly
to the or even indirectly to the harris
biden team to figure out how they should
cover the campaign
in the most friendly way i would be
surprised
i would be surprised because that
wouldn't conform to anything that we've
observed for the last several years
they do seem to be working together and
i don't mean that in a conspiracy kind
of a way i mean that
as in well just open your eyes it's it's
obvious
you just have to watch to know that
they're working together
i don't think that's anything that is
disputable
and so i claim that if you were to look
at the choice of words
that the the pro-kamala people are using
you can start to see what they've agreed
is the message
and it may come out it might slowly form
or it might
very quickly form but already i think
we're seeing some hints
now the background of this is i told you
that when i studied hypnosis
i learned that people will reveal their
hidden intentions
by their choice of words they don't know
they're doing it
they think they're saying x but if you
look at the words they choose
the words are telling you you're saying
x but the words you chose
are making me think why and i don't
think it's an accident
and the hypnotist learns that
it probably is not an accident no
obviously there could be false positives
because people do just pick weird words
sometimes
but if you look at the entire body of
work and there's a consistency to it
then it means more alright so you look
for the pattern not just
any one person who said one thing and
here's the first part of the pattern
obama
made a statement and he was happy about
the choice or so it seemed in his
statement
and he used this phrase he said that joe
biden nailed the decision
he nailed the decision
interesting choice of words because
there are a million ways
to say that it was a good decision and
you support it
but nailed the decision what's that make
you think of
well if you're having fun on twitter
you're going to say
nailed it kadala harris has that
interesting personal life in her past
with willie brown
nailed it well that's one interpretation
that um you know that
maybe obama was thinking in those terms
i don't think so i don't think he was
here's what i think
what is the other context in which you
hear nail
a lot when you hear nail
would you say there's a nail in the
campaign
no how about a nail
in the house no
how about a nail in the coffin
how about a nail in the coffin because
kamala harris is the final nail
in biden's coffin meaning i don't mean
literally dying i mean his political
death
because you need a kamala harris to get
rid of a joe biden
he doesn't leave on his own let me ask
you this
if you were the powers behind the
democratic party
and you knew you knew that joe biden
couldn't
you know get to the starting line much
less the finish line
and you had to take him out you had to
what kind of vice president would you
put in that position
because it's the vice president who's
going to have to do this
tap tap tap on the shoulder joe
we need to have a talk um
i don't want to be unkind i'm just being
realistic
i know you'd want me to tell you you're
not ready for this job
who else could do that could that be
done by
let's say val demings somebody that
biden maybe just met this year
it'd be hard how about somebody that
he's known for a while but he's not too
close to maybe elizabeth warren
it'd be a hard conversation wouldn't it
elizabeth warren
uh joe i think you're i think you're not
quite ready for the job i don't think
you'll come across
how about somebody who joe biden's son
his beloved son who's who's sadly
departed from this world
how about someone who is close with his
son and with him
and he felt a real connection with him
could that person
tap him on the shoulder and say joe
this is a tough conversation but it's
time
yeah she could name one other person who
could do that
nobody well i mean nobody we know of
nobody who has a national reputation ran
for president
is a legitimate contender for the
presidency
it's that weird little little little
niche
where they could be president you could
see him that way
but they could also tap him on the
shoulder and
not be a dick about it because it's the
being a dick about it
that's the tough part to pull off
anybody could tap them on the shoulder
but you got to do it right all right
first of all he
he deserves it you know joe biden
deserves
i think he deserves a respectful final
chapter
and he deserves somebody who cares about
him and i believe she does
to do the you know to do the final final
move
so she's the perfect one for that
all right so that's obama saying that he
nailed the decision which makes me think
of a nail in the coffin
which makes me say huh is that just a
coincidence that he would use that word
that word nail that immediately made me
think of coffin which immediately
immediately made me think of the end of
joe biden
maybe could be just a coincidence easily
could be a coincidence
let's see some other wording here this
from chris
eliza pundit on cnn
who you may know as being very democrat
friendly
not too surprising on cnn and here's his
wording
listen carefully to the to the last part
of this
because it's the exact choice of words
that matters
joe biden made the pick that maxed about
maximize his chances of continuing to
make the race
a straight referendum on trump blah blah
while also selecting someone whose
resume suggests
being ready to step in
someone whose resume suggests being
ready to step in
do you say ready to step in when you're
talking about somebody who is
ready for the presidency because
ready for the presidency is what we
always say right
yeah the vice president pick that's a
person who can walk into the job
tomorrow that's the way you'd normally
say right
but when do you say step in step
in sounds like you're you're the person
who's causing something to happen
stepping in is active it's not
hey something happened i guess you're
the default and now you're the president
no step in is an active word or an
active
term so let me read the whole sentence
suggests being ready to step
in if and when biden decides to step
aside what if and when
biden decides to set aside it would be
one thing to say
if if not if biden decides to set aside
it's another thing to say when now of
course he can defend this easily right
because biden has already said he would
be a
one-term president so you can easily
interpret this as oh you know when he
decides not to run for a second term
she'd be
all queued up but
the word is step in it's the it's not a
continuity of the
policies they're talking about they're
talking about stepping in to stop
something
if and when biden decides to step aside
step aside all right
there's no doubt in my mind that this
signals as clearly as possible that the
vice president is more important than
this decision obviously
so it looks like a cat is on the roof
situation it looks like the
um the friendly press is going to start
softening the room so that when their
own team hears for the first time
because it might be a surprise to
democrats but not to republicans
so when their own team hears that maybe
the vice president
just possibly putting this out there
just spitballing
i don't know anything could possibly
happen we're just
considering all possibilities if she
were to
say step in now
if you just blurted this out on day one
it would be pretty bad wouldn't it
if you just blurted out and say all
right we got the person who's the top of
the ticket she'll be getting rid of joe
and uh just think to think of her as the
top of the ticket
well you can't do that on day one that's
not a day one message
you gotta you gotta you know creep
toward it you know that's the
joke the cat's on the roof you know if
the cat died
you don't want to tell your you know
your your friend or your brother
that his cat died so you soften a little
bit say hey you know the cats on the
roof were trying to get it down
the next day you say oh we tried to get
it down but it jumped and
it looks like it's injured but you know
we took it to the vets we'll see
and then the third day say succumb to
his injuries
so when they say kabul is ready
just in case she needs to step in yeah
if it went if and when biden decided to
step aside i think that's telling the
public
don't be surprised i think it's
softening the room
is what you're seeing now watch for this
see how often
the democrats themselves and they might
hold off for a few days
but see how often they talk in these
terms
as her as the replacement until it's so
it seems so ordinary that it doesn't
even seem unusual that they replaced the
top of the ticket before
maybe before the nomination would be my
guess
i think they're at least looking at it
for before the nomination i feel that's
i feel it's safe to assume that
conversation has happened
all right how about somebody else how
about frida
gitas writing on cnn how would
this pundit try to frame harris in the
most
friendly way uh and this pundit called
her a centrist
a perfect match for joe biden because
he's a centrist
and she's a centrist and then let me
check on
fox news let's see if they're calling
kamala harris a centrist don't see that
word
nope turns out that fox news and all the
republicans
will be calling her a wild wild
progressive
who is going to change things so
radically you won't recognize this
country and she'll be ruining it in the
process
so what do they do to combat kamala
harris being a wild
socialist uh crazy person
they say oh she's a centrist
centrist so watch them try to protect
her in the centrist thing
and how about this so this is also from
frida
keites i think i'm pronouncing that
right we're close
says of harris she would become the
first woman vice president
and she also has a very good shot at
becoming president
not only because of biden's age
but because she is now the automatic
choice for his
successor not only because of his age
so we're already talking about successor
did people talk about uh mike pence as
trump's
successor did did you did you ever hear
one time somebody say oh yeah mike pence
he would be trump's successor no you
didn't
so watch all the language about that um
assuming that the two tweets
all right are getting lit up here on
on incoming messages so i'm gonna have
to turn this off
um so sean king you all know him
uh he is a what would you call him a
a uh activist for the black community
would that be fair an activist for the
black community
who for whatever reason doesn't appear
to be a black person
but it's not for me to judge he
self-identifies that way but
that's part of the story so apparently
some time ago before biden was selected
as the presumptive nominee he
said there are two candidates you should
not consider he tweeted this
one of them is bided and the other is
harris and the reason that those two
in particular are ruled out is because
they're
too racist in their past decisions
meaning
police actions and the legal system
and causing more black people to be put
in jail
and so sean king said those are the only
two you should
not consider totally racist policies
anybody else's is okay but those two
off the table and uh
he's revised that to 100 support
so well a lot can change in a few months
get it
we went from oh there are only two that
you can't consider
to 100 support what a good choice got
the strongest team i've ever seen
all right let's talk about the
attacks coming in on harris
does it matter that allegedly her
i don't know great great grandparents or
somebody owned
slaves in jamaica do you think that that
will
matter to anybody
the answer is no it won't you know the
republicans will make a big deal about
it
but i think it will change zero votes
because here's the thing if you're
trying to get reparations
and you're trying to get something or
you're trying to influence etc
yeah you make a big deal about maybe the
people you're trying to influence hey
you know people who look like you own
slaves and therefore
maybe we should get well we want so it's
a good line of attack
but it's not one anybody believes in in
other words even the people
saying you should pay reparations it's
more of a technique
it's not that i don't think too many
people think that i owe
anybody reparations having no
connections to any slavery in my past
whatsoever
and indeed being closely connected to
the abolitionists
in the northeast you know that's where
my family comes to that line
so does anybody really i mean really
think that i owe any reparations well
they'll say it
if i ask people they say yeah here's my
argument but nobody really feels it
right it's just sort of an argument you
can make and it might work
but in order for kamala harris to suffer
from this
accident of history that somebody for
some of her relatives were in that
line of business allegedly you'd have to
care about it
and their own team doesn't care about it
it's just a technique
so i don't think that'll have any any
impact you know it's
it's a kitchen sink kind of an attack
where you just throw everything at her
and see what sticks
so that'll be in the mix but won't be
especially
important how about this
i think it's interesting that the pro
kamala harris people can't quite decide
how to label her
i don't know if they'll ever settle on
this but is she the first
black woman a black woman on a major
party's presidential ticket
or is she also the first indian american
or is she the first
indian black woman
how do they what do they call her will
the black community say oh yeah
she's one of us and
and if they do do they just ignore
the the other half of her i mean it
worked with obama
right with obama the the black part of
his heritage was embraced
and that sort of became the defining
thing and i think that worked to his
advantage
because much of the country was saying
the same thing i said this too
which is can't we just get a black
president just
can we just get past this you know as
long as you can do the job
you know i'm not even too particular if
it's my first choice
i'd like to get a black president so i'm
completely guilty
of judging obama positively because of
his ethnicity
because i just thought the country
needed to get past it and i also think
we need to get past the
never having a woman for president maybe
not this time
you know i'm not i'm not all caught up
on it being
this election but yeah america needs to
get past this
um and i would even agree you know in
in a weird way you might not expect this
but i would agree with how many
how many people signed a letter in the
democratic party
saying you know let's let's put a black
woman into the presidency
or at least set one up to potentially be
there
um that's not a wrong impulse
as long as it's a good candidate right
because you can get a twofer you know
what
what would be better than having a
perfectly good candidate
who also makes the rest of the country
feel yeah okay anybody can be president
we've now demonstrated that anybody
could be present
well i think you'd have to throw in the
lgbtq
candidate someday to really say
everybody but
it'd be a plus in my opinion if she were
the right candidate and i'm not sure
that's the case
in this case so we'll see
how she gets labeled and it almost feels
like the democrats are going to have to
test this
think about how distasteful this
following thought is
the democrats probably are polling and
doing
focus groups which would be normal all
the way through the process
but one of those focus groups probably
or polls probably will be what do we
call her
do we just say would you just go with
african-american because that's our
strongest play
or do we go with both and say yeah she's
she's she's better than just being black
she's also got
you know first indian american thing
going for her too
and and how do you feel and this is part
i have a complete
blind spot for i i know
i have no sense for how this will be
received by
indian americans if you're if you're uh
you know you have indian heritage and
you're an american citizen and you're
going to vote
do you care about this at all i don't
know
i don't know if you care about it one
way or the other um
and if you're a a black citizen in this
country
does it bother you that they couldn't
find a proper black person
here i'm using proper in the you know
not the serious sense proper in the
sense of
seriously you couldn't find somebody who
was just black
you know all the other candidates
who were being considered not all of
them but a number of the other
candidates who are being considered
you wouldn't have to wonder what was
their heritage you'd just say okay
this person's black aren't we glad we
have the black vice president on the
ticket so i don't know
how is it somebody somebody who is
a member of the black community needs to
fill me in
because i don't have a good sense of
whether that's a positive or a negative
oh and then there's also the uh
the jamaica connection
how do people see that in the united
states so i don't know
i'll leave that as an open question
somebody can fill me in later
how about the claims that kamala harris
uh somebody said this embodies systemic
racism
because uh she had allegedly put
innocent black men in prison and tried
to keep him there
what about that do you think that
democrats will
treat her harshly as republicans hope
will be the case
because she was tough on crime and maybe
even tough on innocent people
she was so tough on crime that you know
if she got you in jail she wanted to
keep you there even if the information
changed
that's the claim i don't know that that
matters
i actually don't i just don't know
if democrats are going to respond to
this
because i think harris will do a
perfectly good job of reinventing
herself
so that whatever she used to do as a
prosecutor
and let me tell you the easiest way to
do this if i were her i would just say
when i was a prosecutor i did everything
in my power
to be a prosecutor did i ever get one
wrong
probably probably unfortunately you
can't really be a prosecutor in a major
metropolitan area
and get them all right i wish it were an
option
but i don't know that it is however
what i can tell you is that i will take
that same intensity
that you know i know people saying that
maybe i got something wrong but i'm
going to take that intensity
to the presidency or vice presidency etc
so i think you you could just describe
it as being a different job
you know the prosecutor mindset is
different from the
senate mindset and i think she can just
say she's reinvented
i don't even know if she needs to say
she did anything wrong
she could just say you know that was
when i was a prosecutor
let's talk about you know let's talk
about modern times not ancient times
so that's a reasonably good attack and i
can see that
i think some of the black community was
already primed
to be not too happy about that part of
her past so we'll see if that makes a
difference it could
the new york times uh hilariously ran
a like a full like gigantic
photo of harris looking pretty awesome
you know she i think she had a leather
jacket on and arms are crossed and
it was a flattering angle it just made
her look powerful and substantial
and then somebody somebody went back and
saw how did the new york times
cover the selection of mike pence and
they showed that
the day he was selected by trump has
this little postage stamp in the corner
so one of them is this full-page glamour
shot of
kamala but mike pence postage stamp
bottom right hand corner where nobody
reads it so
if you think that your press is
independent
hahaha all right so one of the things
that people are saying about
comlet and i think you're gonna watch
this because they're saying that she
that uh uh that she causes a string
a strong negative reaction in people
that's true what do you say would you
not say
that kamala harris does create a strong
negative reaction
in a lot of people i feel that's true
both on her own team and obviously the
other team
and so the question is is that a
negative
and i would say watch out for that watch
out for that
because the thing that makes you really
care about
anything is also an indicator of
influence
i would suggest that it's possible that
the reason republicans
are so anti-harris is exactly because
she's scary
scary in terms of she might have the
goods
she might be able to to crack this up
uh whoever said next topic we're gonna
ban you forever
i just don't like the negativity um
so here is what i would caution you
think of some people who
who generate really intense negatives
aoc and president trump
those two characters generate more
negativity
than maybe anybody you've seen lately
but
they're also two of the most successful
people is that a coincidence
i would suggest it's not that that
strong negative feeling you feel about
any candidate
is you being afraid of them in many
cases
and if you're afraid of them it suggests
they have power
it suggests that you know they have
power so the reason that you even
care is that you think they could
actually get something done
and it's not what you want done if you
thought they were completely weak and
ineffective
you would still make your jokes and
you'd still take your sides
but you wouldn't care that much you
wouldn't feel it
harris does have the x factor
sorry from day one and part of the
reason that i predicted her
in early 2018 is when i selected her
from all the people that were
at least in the conversation for running
for president the reason i picked her
out of the crowd
is the same reason i picked trump out of
the crowd
in 2015. same reason i picked aoc out of
the crowd
when everybody said she's a flash in the
pan and i said
oh no that's whatever you're seeing
there is no flash in the pant
that's a that's real and there's going
to be more of that not less of it
and here we are aoc is a important
national figure in
no time at all so harris has the same
thing
maybe a lighter form i'm not sure she
has the full
wattage of either the two i mentioned
but
she she causes you to remember her
and she causes you to look at the tv
when she's on
and she causes you to feel something if
you've got that stuff going for you
you can channel it eventually
now the way that aoc channeled her power
if you can call it that is we assume she
had a great advisor have you not heard
that
that she was actually selected by really
skilled operators
she was trained and then she was guided
through her tweets and her initial
stuff she may be operating on her own
now but we think that having
expert guidance on top of that raw
whatever that is she has is what made
her what she is
likewise trump has this raw power
but in his case he's had decades of
practice
honing it and using it influencing
talking in public
so he was basically his own advisor in a
sense
you know trump just figured out how to
control his power
over over uh his experience
and here's what to watch with harris
watch what the world-class advisers on
the democrat side
do with her she is not going to be the
same candidate
she was in the primaries and by the way
i predicted this when she dropped out of
the primaries
i said that she's going to come back
upgraded that way you saw was version
1.0
and version 2.0 is going to look
different
sound different and act differently
is it different or differently in that
context i always get those wrong
but and i think you already saw it
so the criticisms that i used to make is
that she used to laugh too much at her
own jokes which makes her seem
uh less confident and less of a leader
so watch for her to be less of a
giggly about stupid things happening in
her environment like
because that that just takes away from
the whole presidential vibe
100 chance that when she got to the
level that she was being considered for
vice president
that there were serious advisors that
got involved for the first time
like the the really high-end ones that
tell you to do something and you say to
yourself
i think that's totally wrong but because
you told me to do it
and i know you know what you're talking
about i'm going to give it a try
you know you need somebody that strong
of an advisor
to cause somebody with that strong of a
personality to actually
behave differently it would be hard to
do
so i think that she has now the top
advisors
and you also see this do you know how
she used to move when she talked
she would move her shoulders and made
her look unconfident she'd say well you
know
i think i think the president is a big
old baddie
whatever and as long as her her
shoulders were jumping around
she didn't look confident watch this
you you take her persona
and you just give her enough lessons to
bring it down to
a confident smile confident smile
and just a clear clean presentation
and you've got a whole different
candidate and she's dangerous
if you think that she can't take out
president trump
you might be underestimating her now we
haven't seen her
in full action in this context
it could be the first two or three times
we see her it's so bad that we just go
okay that
i guess she couldn't take couldn't take
instructions i guess she didn't learn
anything
i don't know that that's going to happen
i think you're going to see
a different candidate i think she'll be
more serious
more focused she'll have better energy
and i think she'll even dress
differently i'll bet you'll see
differences in everything from her
makeup to her jewelry
to her hairstyle and that it will be the
changes that are not just cosmetic
but um let's say targeted for the
the look and the time and the purpose
and the and the effect
all right uh there's a photo of joe
biden
talking to kamala on his computer and
uh telling her that she's selected as if
she didn't already know that
the funny thing about this to me is that
you see joe biden's
desk so it looks like is his personal
desk
and he has on his desk a hagar the
horrible
comic strip framed
now if you didn't already have enough
reason
to vote against joe biden let me say it
again
he has a hagar of the horrible comic
strip on his desk
no dilbert comic anywhere if you look on
that whole desk
there's not a single dilbert comic
and if that's not disqualifying i don't
know what is
um meanwhile the black lives matter
co-founder
i don't know how many founders or
co-founders there were three
can anybody tell me how many co-founders
does black lives matter have
but one of them and i don't other dames
which is a clever thing they do they
don't make the leaders
famous quick tell me the name of one of
the leaders of black lives matter
uh i think there was a woman
right you don't you don't you don't even
know who it is
and i think that's intentional but one
of the black lives matter co-founders
said
that the looting that's been happening
lately is reparations
and you just you should see
somebody thought that telling me that i
suck at cartoons
would be a good thing to do here goodbye
people who don't know that art is
subjective
um so what do you think is uh
looting reparations would you agree with
black lives matter
that the looting is reparations
i say yes yeah i would say the looting
it was reparations and now we're done
with the reparations because the
reparations died with the looting
so in a way but for different reasons i
completely agree with the black lives
matter co-founder
the looting was your reparations so
if there was anybody who wasn't looting
but they also wanted some reparations
it didn't work out for you this time and
probably never
because the looting i think in the minds
of people who would have to decide that
reparations was a good idea i.e white
people
and people who are well white people and
anybody who is not black
would be the ones who would have to be
convinced because one assumes that the
black community might be on board with
this
if it ever became serious the
reparations part
but other people would have to be
convinced and what has happened
in the past month or two well black
lives matter went from
a really good idea you know the idea
that we should treat each other
with the same respect i thought we
already were frankly i didn't know it
was a problem but if somebody says it
was a problem
i i'm totally on board with the
philosophy
but the organization itself well
doesn't look so good the black lives
matter organization
by focusing on the lowest priority
which turned out to be based on the fake
premise because now we know the
michael brown thing was a justified
shooting according to
two separate investigations state and
federal
and believe me they were looking for a
problem they were not looking to get
this guy off
nobody was looking for that but that's
how it turned out
turns out it was a justified shooting
and
and now we know of course even the
george floyd thing he was so full of
fentanyl that unfortunately he was going
to die no matter what
which doesn't absolve the cops but it
clearly wasn't any kind of race related
murder situation
so now that black lives matter is
completely discredited in my opinion
by becoming associated with looting
saying things like looting his
reparations
uh which i agree with because now we're
done with reparations forever
it's off the table and um
i think also that by focusing on their
smallest
and at a problem that's not even real uh
which is
you know the police killing of black
people it's not real in the sense that
it's not worse than any other group and
it and even if it were exactly what you
thought it was
and it was more of a problem than it was
for other groups even if that were true
which it isn't
i think the part about stopping more
often and
and harassing is definitely true but you
know we don't know what's that
is that is that because of the
neighborhood you're in you know does a
black police officer harass a black
suspect
more than a white woman would i don't
even know if there's any difference
anyway even if you assume the worst
about the whole policing situation
it's still the smallest priority the
biggest priority
by far the one that changes everything
if you get it right is education
and that means the the teachers unions
are the source of ongoing
um systemic racism so if the black
community ever wanted to march against
the
teachers union and actually guess
something good you know the ability to
compete in schools and
therefore improve if they ever wanted to
do that the republicans would line up
an outnumber right if the black
community wanted to work on their
biggest problem
education because if you get that right
you got your job you got
you know basically everything is better
if you're making money you're educated
you've got a job
things are working out for you so you
can't make racism go away
but you can certainly make yourself
relatively immune to it
as oprah has for example um
anyway black lives matter completely
discredited even though the idea
is good all right
um let's talk about herd immunity
because i know you want to
let's talk about that um i got a little
more data here
because the the optimistic hope is that
the reason sweden has uh something close
to zero deaths now from
coronavirus ongoing deaths
is because we assume they reached a herd
immunity but
if they did it would suggest that it's
easy to get there
and that maybe herd immunity is closer
to 20
of the population not 60. now if that's
true
and maybe it's because of this so-called
t-cell immunity
meaning that if you if you had some
exposure to other types of coronaviruses
you might have a little residual
immunity to this new one because it's
got a lot in common
and it might be enough for some people
but
i asked this question well are there
other situations
in which people pass that 20 percent
and here are some examples and counter
examples
now i'm before you jump to the
conclusion say
scott you can't make any decision based
on that thing you said
that's where i am too so nothing i tell
you next
should suggest that you could make a
decision based on it but i'll give you
some context
so the diamond princess 19 of the people
tested had chronovirus and so you say to
yourself
okay that's consistent with herd
immunity being
20 percent-ish because they were all on
this cruise ship together
if it reached 19 and stopped
maybe that's because we got it in time
but maybe it's also
because it was going to stop there
anyway but
what about the argentine cruise ship in
which 59
had it and so we've got one with 19
born with 59 pretty different now the 59
is coincidentally right where we thought
the top of herd immunity was
but again that doesn't mean anything
it's one situation
we don't know what happened after they
knew they had it how they quarantined
etc
but what if i'll just throw this out
there what if
people on cruise lines don't travel
alone
what if they're always packed together
with their family
and what if one of a family of four
got the coronavirus but then they were
quarantined with the three other members
of their own family
what happens to the three other members
probably gonna get it because they're in
this little room
with you know whatever kind of
ventilation they've got on cruise ships
and if one of you has it i don't know
your family's probably going to get it
too so do we have a situation where
you can't really tell because of the
unique way that they handled quarantines
i don't know so i would say you can't
tell anything about that but i would add
to the conversation
that there is some notion that the
higher your viral load
the more likely you're going to catch it
so being around a lot of iris
more likely to get it than being around
you know a normal amount
and i would say that the how how much
you're packed into a space
and what kind of ventilation you have
probably changes completely
what it means to have heard levels so in
other words
you might be able to reach heard at 20
percent in sweden
because people are kind of spaced out
you know they yeah they have the option
of spacing out whereas if they're all
packed into a
prison or or a cruise ship
maybe you don't get to herd until you're
at 60
because there's just so much viral load
it's just all packed in there
there's nothing you can do maybe
so in other words so here's the
hypothesis
that is unproven that if we have these
t-cell
uh immunities meaning we haven't been
specifically exposed
to the virus but we've been exposed to
other ones that gives us some immunity
the thought is that there's some amount
of viral load
that would overcome whatever natural
immunity you have
so there's no such thing as just being
having some immunity
there's immunity at a certain level and
you could overwhelm that with enough
virus
that's the hypothesis how about inmates
we've got we've got one prison that had
a
nearly 70 percent were infected again
maybe they're just all too close
together not enough sanitation
do you make anything of that i don't
think you can a homeless shelter
there was one at 24 another one at 36
percent
let me ask you this uh do homeless
people
spend a lot of time in close proximity
to each other
not so much right the the homeless
people i see are pretty much
loners yeah i obviously they're homeless
families
but wouldn't you say that the homeless
are uniquely
able to stay away from other people in a
weird way
i mean if you looked at the homeless
people in the street they're not
interacting with each other so much
are they you know i don't spend much
time around
that situation so i don't know but it
wouldn't surprise me
if the homeless just have a natural
distancing thing built into their
situation
so they're down at that 24 and 36
percent
tested in two different shelters so
we've got another french aircraft
carrier 60
it's pretty hard to get away from other
people on an aircraft carrier right
you're
packed into these little bunking places
but a us aircraft carrier had 17 percent
again probably has to do with when they
caught it you know how early they caught
it probably doesn't tell you anything
all right so those are some examples so
what what we know
the only thing we learned from that is
that in these enclosed spaces
be they a prison or or a cruise ship
you could have an infection anywhere
from 20 to 70 percent
so so we know that
but what we don't know is a big old
country where you've got the option of
spreading out
if 20 or so could be the limit
now if 20 herd immunity
is not enough we don't know what's
happening in sweden do we
how do you explain sweden if in fact
they didn't achieve herd immunity what
is it
if it's not that could it be vitamin d
ah okay
suppose because sweden has the unique
quality
that although they don't get enough sun
to get the right kind of vitamin d
they know that so it is normal to
supplement
so they have vitamin d like crazy in
supplements fish oil supplements i guess
so could it be that 20 percent of their
community
is weak enough for other reasons
co-morbidities age whatever
that they're weakened but as long as
you're a normal healthy person with
vitamin d
maybe you just can't get it maybe
something like that
so vitamin d could still be part of our
answer it's not it's not eliminated
but it's not confirmed either
and i wouldn't be surprised if it comes
out that way
now what did i tell you about how
president trump's performance on the
coronavirus would be compared
by election day i made the following
prediction that those countries that had
gotten good control of the coronavirus
early say your germany's and your
new zealands would have recurring
infections and a second wave
and as long as we don't know what stops
this thing as long as we don't know
where herd immunity is and i'm not sure
we're all going to be sweden
i predicted that those who did well
would have a second wave it would make
the president's performance look better
because the other people would look
worse
and that all of those countries that
people said hey look at this country
why can't we be more like them and the
answer will be
their time is coming and it might happen
before
before election day
um somebody says hydroxychloroquine
well i know i'm still a 30 chance that
hydroxychloroquine
is a game changer and and part of the
reason is
i just feel like i know by now i can't
believe we could get to this
point having so much talk about it so
many so many studies
that we wouldn't just know by now
and the fact that it's still up in the
air and in fact
a lot of people leaning against it i
don't know by what percentage
just makes me think it's not it couldn't
possibly be as effective
as the claims because it would just be
so obvious
by now but who knows
but we do live in a world where the
unusual can happen
so i can't rule out anything um
apparently the word kamala
translates to horrible in the finnish
language
so there there's a lot of foreshadowing
in there
um all right so that's all i got for now
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
