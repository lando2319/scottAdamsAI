foreign
good morning everybody
I hope you're feeling great because
today is going to be a really good day
for most of you for most of you yeah and
showing up here at the live coffee with
Scott Adams if you are alive
is one of the best things that's ever
what Neil pert scored higher than Max
why is somebody mentioning Neil pert
when I was just watching Neil pert
videos how is that even possible
literally the last the last video I was
watching and somebody's mentioning this
obscure drummer how is that even
possible anyway sorry I'm having a
little simulation moment here
but if you'd like to take your
experience up to the stratosphere all
you need is that comfortable glass of
tanker shelves to Stein the canteen
juggar flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your
favorite liquids I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure
the uh dopamine the other day thing
makes everything better go
ah
Neil Perch is no obscure drummer
you be a non-obscure drummer if you know
drummers
well the the best fake news of the day
I'm gonna I'm gonna say I fell for it
that'll be my story
uh I totally fell for it
um the story was that the place and the
Zero Hedge tweeted this originally
the place that Joe Biden fell off his
bicycle on Google Maps
the name of that place is called
Brandon Falls
Brandon Falls the exact place he fell
off his bicycle
now when you saw that did you say to
yourself well that's definitely true
or did you say to yourself that's a
little
a little too on the nose
well my first reaction to that is no
that's just somebody geotagged it which
is a thing you can do so it'll show up
on the map but that doesn't mean it's
the name of the town
but I tweeted that mofo anyway do you
know why
because for the three or four seconds it
would take before it got debunked which
it did it took a few seconds but it got
debunked right away I wanted you to feel
it was true
I'm not proud of that but but when I
first thought when I first read it
I thought oh this is really funny
because it might be true
but then after about 10 seconds you say
no that's just a geotag but I tweeted it
anyway because I wanted you to have the
same experience that for a few seconds
you'd think is that true it would just
be like really weird and fun and then
you know a minute later you'd find out
none of it was true it was just some
some Joker geotaged it which by the way
is funny enough
right the fact that it was done by a
joker
and it's not real is just as funny
so I thought well either way but anyway
it wasn't real
um
so uh Comey who's writing in the
Washington Post why it's so important
that all the January 6 protesters
be held accountable you know all the
ones that broke laws and that everyone
should be you know followed up on
I guess there are some FBI people that
Comey is aware of
who are thinking that maybe the you know
the treatment of the January 6 people
was a little harsh compared to how other
protesters and other contexts have been
treated
but Comey is saying new new new and this
is one of the things that Comey says
quote
he says none of that matters because
surely you agree on one thing January 6
can't happen again
really is that do we agree on that
I don't agree on that
I don't even agree that January 6 was
bad
except for the violence and you know the
violence was bad of course so everybody
agrees the violence was bad don't don't
make that a thing
but what about the fact that there was a
major protest at the Capitol and it was
really dicey was that a feature or a
flaw
let me let me say something about
America Mr Comey which is something you
apparently don't know about your own
country
it goes like this
if something happens that the government
does if the government does something
let's say an election
and the signal
is that there's fraud
the signal
doesn't mean the signal is correct there
are lots of false signals but definitely
the signal from this election was that
there was something sketchy and you
ought to pause for a second and make
sure that everything's okay that's what
the protesters wanted now ask me do I
not want that to happen again
no I do want that to happen again
but Scott Scott you say people got hurt
you want that to happen again yes I do
not the hurt part but if it's part of
the package yes yes and protests are
dangerous people get hurt let me say it
unambiguously if the same situation
arose again
where where half I'm going to say half
the country had deep questions about the
Integrity of the election system
I want another January 6.
and I don't care if I don't care if it's
the Democrats who are protesting a
republican victory I don't care who the
winner was
that's not even on my radar that's a
whole separate question but if you send
the American people a big glaring signal
of fraud
there's going to be a crowd
there's going to be a crowd
that doesn't mean the signal is correct
right we lots of stuff we see as signals
are just false
probably hassled maybe most of them
maybe most of the signals are false but
you tell me that you send a signal this
glaringly big that something might be
wrong might be because I I haven't seen
any proof that the election was rigged
personally but did it signal that
something needed to be looked at yes
it did
in the eyes of a lot of smart people who
may have been suffering from you know
confirmation bias whatever but a lot of
smart people looked at it and said that
we need to look into that's that's a
pretty big signal right there you you
don't just ignore that signal
so to Mr Comey let me say I could not
disagree more uh what this country needs
is more January 6 not less
we did more of it we need a crowd to
form when it's obvious our government is
sending signals to fraud
has the Biden Administration sent any
signals that they're not credible in
dealing with China
yes they have
they'll wander by the laptop now there
hasn't been a protest over that that I
know of
but if a protest formed
over that and people got hurt I would be
in favor of that
not the not the people getting hurt but
a process in which people take higher
risk because they think there's a higher
level problem
yes when people see a high level problem
or even maybe a high level problem and
they take high level risk to address it
that's the country I want to live in
don't tell me you're taking that away
that's the reason I love this country
and it's like burning in the flag I've
said this a million times but I'm going
to keep saying it till everybody's until
everybody believes it
I don't want to salute a flag I can't
burn
the the fact that you can burn it in
public
is why I glorify it
that's why I respect it
that's why I honor the flag because you
can burn that thing in public and it
gets stronger every time you burn it it
gets stronger
burn it burn it today you could burn it
right in front of me you know I know a
lot of you would be so offended if you
saw a flag burning right in front of you
you might try to put it out you know you
might get violent with the person who's
doing it you'd be so offended not me
not me you can burn that flag right in
front of me you can put a whole pile of
flags set them all on fire and when
you're done
that flag will be stronger
because it let you burn it up and it
didn't do anything
that's how it gets his power
the power of the flag is you can burn it
don't lose that don't lose that that's a
feature
foreign
all right
um
and uh Comey says we have a constitution
and statues and blah blah blah and the
FBI's job is to send the message that it
can never happen again if we were to
remain the nation under law no Mr Comey
it's going to happen again
because we're America
yeah we got a lot of flaws
we Americans got a lot we got a lot to
answer to right
people got questions about us okay
they're not all bad questions we get a
lot to answer to
but there is one thing we're going to
get right every time
 around and find out
we'll get that right every time
 around and find out that doesn't
mean we're always right but if you
around you got to find out it's just
it's built into the American DNA in most
countries I think
you know we're not that that unique
well uh CNN
um has continued as two-prong plan to
destroy the planet while also telling
you that it could be fun
could be fun does that sound like an
exaggeration
the CNN is destroying the planet but
simultaneous simultaneously telling you
how you can have fun with it
well there was a story today
about how you know we might have energy
problems and you might lose your AC
during the summer
but uh CNN explains that you can still
have fun on hot days and then it gives
you a number of tips for not overheating
so CNN and their and the like have
pushed the climate change narrative
until it caused people to overreact and
get rid of their own energy sources
without Replacements online
so CNN and others who have gotten us to
this place where we reviled the energy
that could you know power our AC
um
they're literally trying to sell you
that everything's fine oh yeah it'll be
110 and you won't have AC but you know
you can still have fun in the heat you
can still have fun in that you just you
don't overdo it here's some tips
put a nice put an ice cube in your pants
oh that's right your freezer doesn't
work
just go send your electric car with the
AC on as long as you don't have to
recharge it yeah
so that's nice of them to destroy the
world and tell us how to enjoy it
well uh Janet Yellen says that we're
working with South Korea and probably
some other allies to try to decouple
from China and the rare earth materials
because China has a lot of that market
and we depend on it apparently so it's a
bad thing to depend on that because our
whole tech industry and our in our
military and everything else depends on
those rare earth materials going into
products
but now we're going to decouple from
China
and looking at South Korea for chips and
other stuff
and let me ask you this
how many of you remember
during Trump's first term and it was
early on before the pandemic
so how many of you remember that before
the pandemic I was tweeting like an
idiot
that we should decouple from China's
economy
how many people remember me saying over
and over again and do you remember the
reaction I got
does anybody remember the reaction from
the public now some of you follow me
were like yeah yeah let's do it but
generally speaking what would you say
the public reaction was
the public reaction was that's not going
to happen
that's never going to happen Scott Scott
that's not going to happen
well it's happening
now it took a pandemic to do it
but
you know something was going to happen
to wake us up it just happened to be
that
now yeah the the idiot cartoonist was
asking for decoupling but we're
decoupling that's happening now here's
the question to you take me out of the
equation for a moment
which which of our political leaders
were also early on decoupling
from China name somebody who's running
for president or might you know somebody
whose name is in the mix
and
um Trump
right Trump okay now I did Trump ever
say decouple
have you ever said have you ever heard
Trump say decouple I don't know if he's
used that word
somebody's saying Rand Paul
Rand Paul is 70 couple
as Holly I haven't heard Holly
the one I know is Tom Cotton
can you confirm that
I think Tom Cotton has was the earliest
and strongest voice of the you know
high-end politicians well Tucker was you
know not a politician but are the people
running for president
I think it was Tom Cotton right
so re when you're deciding who to
support here
I would just ask you to remember who was
right
and who is vocally right yeah Kyle bass
of course highly influential on this
so
give us give a thought to the fact that
I think Tom Cotton had the right
priorities and sought early
um
so we're watching the left uh try to
explain uh Biden away and it looks like
some of them have turned we'll talk
about that in a minute but
have you tried having a conversation
with a Democrat and asking how they how
they feel about their Biden presidency
have you done that lately
you should try it
just ask how they think they're doing
and watch the answer
because I'm pretty sure there's nobody
who thinks he's doing a good job
like actually
you know anything I'm pretty sure
literally no one
quietly like in their private time I
don't think anyone thinks he's doing a
good job I could be wrong but I don't
think so
so watching somebody answer a question
when you know they're lying is really
useful
here's a tip for you
if there's somebody in your life that
you suspect is a liar
don't don't try to catch them on all
their lies
let them lie because when you let them
lie if you know their life this is the
important part you know they're lying
watch how they do it because people lie
in very specific ways it's almost like a
fingerprint the way one person lies is
completely different than the way
another person lies and look for that
once you notice that
you're going to see the telephone lying
it'll be really obvious but you have to
let them lie so you can see their method
I hate to tell you how many times I've
done this
let people lie to me go okay all right
you're lying so how you doing it okay
you've added a whole bunch of details
okay that's a technique
so the way some people lie is they'll
add characters and details and like
whole events like an entire imagined
event
but
some people will never lie like that
that's just like too far other people
what the most they'll do is lie by
Omission like leave out a little context
right I would say if you catch me in a
lie
it's all it's going to be that one
yeah here's a here's a lie I never tell
uh
a thing didn't happen that did
like I would never tell a lie this as a
thing happened when it didn't or did
when it didn't like that's a direct lie
I don't tell those like I don't know
maybe there's some special case or
something but like that's that's a lie
that I don't like the cross but if
somebody asked me a question and I
didn't feel like a complete answer
I might leave out something
you have a very normal human behavior
you don't have to be proud of it
sometimes it's just easier you know
sometimes it's just convenience it's not
a big deal
so watch for people's technique
and those are just a sample but if you
look at the way they lie you can you can
find people's pattern and then you'll
see it every time
all right
um but Jimmy Fallon had a really funny
joke about Joe Biden's fist bump with uh
the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia
uh Jimmy Fallon's joke is that it wasn't
the fist bump he was trying to punch him
as hard as he could
that's the best he could do
you know it's Jimmy Fallon's joke so
I'll let him have the joke
but I was imagining me telling the joke
if had been me telling it and I think it
would have been more physical uh it
would have been you know Joe Biden
winding up
and and the Crown Prince seeing you
coming and say
well it looks like he's going to punch
me
I better stop that
so he puts his fist out
it's a good joke
but are you surprised that uh you know
somebody who would be left oriented
Jimmy Fallon
who would go right after him for for how
weak he is
uh but did you see CNN's top left Page
today
I tweeted out a screenshot of just the
top left part of CNN's page
because the top left
is where they put the propaganda
did you know that by the way all the
propaganda goes in the top left because
that's what people read
when you read a website you start at the
top left and then you may someday get to
the bottom right or the bottom but
probably not
right you're probably going to read the
top top left
so when they want to when they want to
support a narrative
they don't just spread it around where
it belongs they put it in the top left
so you're damn well gonna see it
and so the top left of CNN is uh
negative Biden pieces today there's even
a negative Jill Biden piece
if they're starting to on Jill
Biden Jill Biden right not Hunter not
Joe but Jill
all right now
let me put my uh personal Line in the
Sand here
I don't make fun of first ladies
generally
and if someday there's a first gentleman
I'm not going to make fun of that person
either
because they didn't they didn't run for
office right yeah I get that they're
part of the deal but when they got
married they probably weren't thinking
about running for office
so the spouses I always give the spouses
a a free pass
I don't care if it's Melania or Jill or
even Hillary Clinton when she was
like just leave them alone leave them
alone
if they're if they're trying hard
I'm good with that
you know put in a little effort that'd
be good put a little effort now nobody
can nobody can say
nobody can say that Jill Biden isn't
putting in the effort am I right she
might be the hardest working person in
government and she wasn't even elected
so I I'm not going to dump on Jill Biden
you know unless it's just funny or
something I might do that
but just let her
you know just understand we didn't elect
her right she doesn't she's not uh
she doesn't deserve well nobody deserves
anything
all right here's a question for you if
you had some word salad and you wanted
to keep it in a container of some sort
what is the right container for word
salad
well my answer is Kamala Harris's
pantsuit
Kamala Harris's pants
that's the old joke I'm sorry but I feel
as if almost every day we see a new clip
of her babbling like an idiot
how many how many babbling idiot Clips
can you create out of one person who
doesn't really talk that much in public
makes me wonder if you could do that
with me so now I have a
what almost 700 hours of live stream
in my 700 hours of live streams do you
think you could put together a
compilation clip where I'm babbling
actually I don't think so
I mean I've been Stoned on half of them
and I still don't think you could put
together a babbling clip
but imagine the Babbling clip you could
put together with cobbler
so he says Jill is guilty of exploiting
Joe no that's mind reading that's mind
reading she may just find herself in
this situation
right she just might be making the best
of the situation I don't know but I'm
not going to accuse her of something
based on me right reading her mind
that's not going to happen
all right
um so MSNBC
on-air News host type person Katie turr
ENT is noting that there's no trust in
the media and sometimes she's wondering
if she's doing any good
only 16 percent of Americans said they
have a great deal or a lot of confidence
in newspapers in 2022 only 16 of a great
deal of confidence and that's you know
down since 2021.
uh this was according to Gallup
and and Katie turr complains that you
know maybe maybe she's not helping the
world
well Katie
most of Katie's news is on a network
that doesn't even report real news it's
a it's almost an entirely propaganda
Network
and
[Music]
well you know let me digress for a
moment
I think the most important part of the
story is what kind of nickname
did the cruel kids give Katie turr tur
is her last name
in high school
now is that a married name I don't know
if it's a married name might be a
married name that's not as funny
well no it's not turd no it's Katie tur
um it's three quarters of a turd
yeah yeah it's three quarters of a turd
but it's not a full turn
and I think that has to be noted so
Katie who is three quarters of a turd in
name only and name only we're not
insulting here it's just just her name
that's how that's I didn't make that up
speaking of polls they're Rasmussen
polls
uh
things uh so Rasmussen poll asked uh
voters how many think that Joe Biden
profited from China deals now we know
that Hunter Biden profited from China
deals that's an Evidence
but it's a little less proven
that Joe Biden made money from it no and
I would say it's unproven at this point
I I have not seen evidence that would
you know guarantee he made money there's
indications
yeah there are suggestions there are
flags
there are flags and suggestions uh there
are singles there are signals but
there's not proof yet that I've seen
however 62 percent of the public
according to Rasmussen Pole
uh believes that Biden made some money
from China deals
how often do you get 62 percent of
anybody agreeing on anything
did did Trump ever have 62 percent of
the public
uh have a a negative thought about a
single topic you know maybe maybe the
January 6th thing would create that but
while he was in office
um I don't know I don't think he was
ever that unpopular was he
all right
um
yeah
here's something that uh
the so the Democrats have this belief
and I don't know what to do with it
the belief is that if you now if you ask
for an audit of an election that you
think was suspicious
uh your true intention is to become a
dictator
let me say that again this is the two
plus two equals four that the Democrats
have put together
if you insist on an audit of an election
that about half the country thinks is
incredible
and so you asked to check is this really
credible
that means your inner thoughts are to
become a dictator
so if you're working hard to make sure
that a vote was accurate and fair
that's proof that you want to be a
dictator
Democrats also have other things that
are similar to that so working hard to
make sure that an election was fair
that equals trying to be a dictator but
taking a drink of water
is proof that you're trying to become a
cactus
um
taking a ride in a car
is proof that you don't believe
airplanes exist
there are a lot of things that you can
prove in the Democrat way
if you water a plant in your house
that's proof that you have cancer
if you take a walk in a nice summer day
that's proof here a murderer
if you wake up and stretch like this oh
like that
that's proof you're a pedophile
if you
tell a joke
if people laugh
that's proof you're probably Hitler
now I could go on
but I think you see the pattern
uh orange plus pineapple equals hammer
and that is who wants to run the country
no I correct myself that is who is
running the country
the people who say apple plus banana
equals hammer
are in charge of the country the
Democrats
so that's happening
um I learned that from my brainwashed
NPC today
uh Joe Rogan apparently is uh not on
board with the Trump train never has
been he was never a trump supporter in
terms of voting uh but he's called Trump
a man baby and thinks all of his energy
comes from Adderall
okay
here's my question and I thought I think
I saw Jake wieger
said Weger uh saying if Trump
doesn't have the right wing he can't win
to which other people said who are you
calling the right wing
are you calling Joe Rogan who supported
Bernie for president the right wing
let me let me give you another example
of democratic thinking if the guy who
supported Bernie is right wing
um there are other there are other
things you could imagine the Democrats
also think
if uh is light out
at 12 noon that could be indication that
it's uh
it's dark
I don't know a lot of things are not
obvious but the Democrats have explained
it to us
well what do you think but more
generally what do you think of
The prominent prior supporters of trump
who may not be on board this time
I don't think Mike cernovich is on board
but you know I can't speak for him he
has he has complicated thoughts so I
don't try to summarize him if I can
avoid it
um I'm not on board
so yeah who cares do you think it'd make
a difference
do you think it would make a difference
if some of the
the say I'm not going to call myself
charismatic but I'll say other
charismatic people who had some
influence may not be on board what do
you think
uh Scott just wants to win somebody says
is there somebody who doesn't want to
win
somebody here is saying if cernovich is
out Trump has no shot what do you think
see I I think this might be one of those
situations where
the world finds out like how it really
works
let me ask you that question how many of
you think that Mike cernovich being not
on board with Trump would be enough to
make it impossible for him to win
what do you think
or would it even have a big impact you
don't have to say impossible
um most of you are saying no
but I think I asked my question wrong is
the no that he would have no impact or
that
Trump couldn't get elected I don't know
which way I asked the question that I
don't know if the no is agreeing agree
with the thought or disagree
no impact no impact so most of you are
saying small or no impact
so that would mean that your belief
is that servich is not influential
Beyond maybe his you know is a core core
supporters is that what you think
how about me let's move to me
let's say hypothetically and this is
probable let's say that I'm not on board
with Trump for another term would I have
any impact
local says no mostly no a few yeses but
mostly no not anymore that would be a
good answer
nope nope nope nope nope all right so
most of you believe that uh
my opinion and I'll just use Mike
cernovich as an example not important uh
Joe Rogan's opinion
if Joe Rogan went from you know maybe
uh you know disinterest in in Trump to
maybe outright negative
would that make a difference
no impact
interesting so who do you think changes
uh public opinion
who do you think moves the public
opinion Fox News
do you believe that you all are making
up your own opinions
Tucker yeah oh is Tucker going to be
pro-jump
oh there's an interesting question
will Tucker be pro-trumped
what has he I don't think uh well Tucker
probably won't endorse somebody but we
would know by the way he covers it
yeah
what about Greg gotfeld
how is he going to handle a potential
Trump run
but all right you tell me who do you
think uh who who do you think it was a
non-politician who would be the most
influential
on the question of whether Trump gets
reelected name the most influential
non-politician
Ben Shapiro
Steve Bannon
Elon Musk well Elon Musk I wouldn't put
in that list
uh uh the pope Trump Jr
Elon Musk
Tucker Rogan interesting so Baron
Rothschild
okay I'm gonna give you a special credit
for whoever said Baron Rothschild I like
I like the Soros or Russia I'll get
thrown into every conversation
live in
all right um a lot of you a lot of you
think it's Tuckers but here's an
interesting question
do we know what Tucker's opinion would
be on the second Trump run
I don't think I know the answer to that
I mean maybe he's you know not not
talking about it yet
all right
all right I'm going to break some news
for you you want me to break some news
tiny news a little news more has more to
do with me than you
so uh yesterday uh Russell Brand's
producer asked me if I would appear on
Russell Brand's podcast
and I said yes we just have to schedule
so sometime in the next few weeks
um Russell Brand and I will have a
conversation
probably on the topic of all things
important and political I guess I don't
know we'll decide what it is when we get
there now
how do you think that's going to go
what do you think
I mean seriously how do you think that's
going to go
I am so curious
I have to admit this is the most uh
excited I've ever been about a
conversation
and and I would call it a conversation
it's not I don't think it's an interview
per se but
I don't think I've ever been more
excited and you know why by the way do
you know why
I'm excited about it
this will be a good test to see how much
how well you know me
it'll be wild it might be I mean neither
of us have any guard rails so we could
go anywhere
um so some some people saying is be
smart and funny and you know in a
perfect world it would be
but that's not really the special part
it's not it's not just because he's
smart he is brilliant
it's not just because he has six million
uh viewers but that's a big part of it
here here's why
have you ever seen two open-minded
people on a large platform have a
conversation about politics
I'll bet not once
have you
and if you have name it I've never seen
it
there's actually
um
Joe Rogan
yeah
but there's a difference
there's a difference Joe Rogan is more
of an interviewer
meaning that this is my take on it I
think Joe Rogan is uh maybe the best
interviewer we have I would say he's in
the top whatever you know maybe the best
but he gets his uh he gets his guests to
be the Stars
would you agree with that
Joe Rogan's genius is that he makes
stars out of his gas sort of you know
Johnny Carson's effect right Johnny
Carson's always a star but what he does
really well is he makes his guests the
star
and that's what Joe Rogan does now what
I see in and you know he says plenty of
opinions too but it's more about making
the guesses start I I think in the case
of
um
in Russell Russell Brand's case I think
his input
you know is is more essential to the
show
and
but but let me ask you this have you
ever seen two people
who actually maybe could understand some
of the topics
who are open-minded and had a big
platform and talked about the big issues
in public I've never seen it
this actually might be the first
and it it excites me because of the
model
right I'm a big fan of Russell Brand so
you know it's exciting just because it's
him
but you know I I've lived in this world
long enough that um celebrity contact
isn't exciting too much on his own
like I need a little extra to make it
exciting and uh I believe that his his
ability to take a topic where it needs
to go is is damn near unparalleled
and I like to play in that domain as
well so if you put us together
I don't know it feels like matches in
Dynamite
that's what it feels like I just feel
like this is matching Dynamite I don't
know who's matching who's Dynamite but
it's definitely a matching a dynamite so
we might stir some up
yeah we might uh
I don't know well I feel like we're
gonna make a small tear in the in the
fabric of reality
I don't know it'll be fun
um
let's see uh musk has Elon Musk filed a
counter claim lawsuit type thing against
Twitter
and he's got his arguments that Twitter
fired some high-level Executives and
they weren't supposed to do that without
checking with the potential buyer
but what do you think
what do you think of the odds of Elon
Musk prevailing in court or Twitter
prevailing
under the situation that you know about
which is that uh
there may be some question about how
many Bots there are and Elon Musk can't
find that out
and its material
now whether or not the arrangement said
something about I'm not going to look
into things I still think such a
material promise is important like I
don't think they can just lie to you and
say well you said you weren't going to
look into it so we just lied to you I
don't think that's a defense is it
I mean this is sort of an area of the
law like all the rest that I have no
real appreciation for
but I'll tell you my feeling
is that Elon Musk will prevail in court
now he might end up buying the company
but it would be at a different price and
it would be after he found out how many
Bots were there
but that would be a whole separate
conversation
what do you think
now part of it is I can't believe that
musk would have gotten himself into this
situation without having an escape hatch
because he's not like the guy who
doesn't think it through right
he's not he's not operating on impulse
like oh I just feel like buying Twitter
I didn't think it through
oh like that's not him right he thought
it through
so I have a feeling that uh he has a
stronger case and maybe knows it and and
and maybe there's nothing happening here
that isn't going to work in his favor I
feel like all that's happening is uh
is musk is finding the lowest price for
this asset and once he finds it he'll
pull the trigger so that would be my
prediction but I will put this
prediction in a uh not as a binary like
it's you know he buys it happens or not
I'm just going to go with 60 odds
so I'll go with 60 chance that musk wins
and buys the company at a lower price
eventually
I think walkaway is a a reasonable
prediction yeah both of them walking
away
yeah it's entirely possible that Elon
Musk has no interest in Twitter by now
he may have lost interest who knows
um
all right
here's some
fake news on Fox so on the fox website
since I often point out CNN's fake news
I like to balance do you believe there's
any fake news on the Fox News website
today or do you think that that's all
true
well
um an article there by Tyler Olsen on
Fox News he mentions this just in a
throwaway line
about Biden making regular gaffs ranging
from the inane like appearing to shake
hands with a person who is not there
that's fake news
as far as I know Biden has never
attempted to shake hands with the person
out there
he has on at least two occasions
signaled with his open hand that he was
you know asking should I walk over here
or do we go sit here or you go first and
then it gets clipped so you don't see
that's what he's doing it looks like
he's shaking hands with a ghost that's
fake news
now the way it was worded was kind of
interesting
it's called a gaff which doesn't mean
necessarily that you were stupid or
wrong it means you did something that
turned out poorly
and and one example is it appearing to
try to shake hands with a person who's
not there
I think if you write that it appears he
tried to shake hands you need to clarify
that it appeared like that to people who
saw the video and of context
it didn't appear like that to me when I
saw the full audio or full video
and if you saw the full thing it
appeared he was he was motioning toward
a chair
so fake news on Fox News
nobody gets away
from my fake news criticism
as you know the Pulitzer committee had
given pool surprises for the New York
Times and Washington Post writers
for their coverage of russiagate which
turned out to be
total
so I guess the Pulitzer committee the
board
they had two reviews
to find out if these Pulitzer awards
were you know still something they would
back and they found there were no
problems
no problems so the Pulitzer committee
has doubled down about giving the
Pulitzer wide review to writers who
literally made up fake news and sold it
to the public and tried to destroy the
Republic
and and they got a Pulitzer
for writing that nearly
destroyed the country
I'm wondering
is it too late for Hitler to get a
Pulitzer from Mein Kampf
because I don't know that there's a time
limit right
you you could have written a book a long
time ago and you still could get a
Pulitzer can it not
yeah so I would say
yeah maybe they should consider that
since they obviously have no ethical uh
or moral core whatsoever
here's a here's the name of a politician
who followed me on Twitter today
and so I followed back because I had to
I had to sometimes there's there's a
follow that you say oh I think I'll
follow this could be fun but sometimes
you just have to
here's why I had to
right he's running for congress in
Arizona
and he's a if I can judge correctly from
his profile picture
I judge him to be a black American
whose actual name is Walt Blackman
whose last name is black man
so if you're a republican running for
congress you're going to get all the
Republican votes because you're
Republican but if your last name is
black man and you're a black man
aren't you going to get 20 of the
Democrat votes automatically
am I wrong about that
just the fact that he's a black man who
is called black man
I think that's worth 20 percent of the
Democrat vote
here here's my predictions if Walt
Blackman has any skills whatsoever
he will be your president someday
I don't know anything about him like
nothing and I've never heard him talk
yeah I just followed him on Twitter
today because he followed me uh you know
there's a picture of him yeah so he's a
good looking guy
seems like you know the right age for
you know building up his political
resume so I don't know anything about
him but if you just say he's a good
looking guy he's about the right age
and he's a Republican and his name is
black man how in the world does he ever
lose an election
like you'd have to be you'd have to be
terrible at campaigning to lose under
those conditions
anyway give them if you feel like it
give them give them a follow he's in
Arizona
but uh mark my words you might hear
about you might hear from him again
all right
uh
all right
I think I was going to talk about
something else but changed my mind
all right I think that covers all the
many uh fascinating things that I want
to discuss today
I'm hoping we'll see more imaginary
evidence in the January 6 hearings today
imaginary evidence is a kind where the
President says something like
um can I have a can somebody bring me a
Diet Coke
and then somebody reports it as he asked
for a Diet Coke and that's Mafia talk
for overthrowing the country
that's pretty much the quality of the
evidence
uh yeah the ban and jury selection
happened
now correct me if I'm wrong but this is
actually happening
Steve Bannon has to manage his schedule
it's kind of it's kind of a difficult
thing to juggle at the moment because
there are two things that Steve Bannon
has knew that he has to add to his
schedule what are the new things is he
has to
testify to Congress which he's agreed to
do
so he's got to work that into a schedule
Testify the Congress at the same time he
has to work into his schedule the court
case in which he's being charged for not
doing that
testifying to Congress voluntarily
so he's got to figure out how to balance
his schedule to testify to Congress but
also try to stay on a jail
for being accused of not testifying to
Congress which he's doing at the same
time
now I understand there's a timing issue
and the Democrats have said oh no he has
to be prosecuted because at one point he
said no
and that's against the law
so even though at one point he said no
but even while the proceedings are still
going so it's not too late at all it's
not too late he agreed to do it
and they're going to prosecute him
anyway
that's your tax dollars so your tax
dollars are going to see the jury
do you have a trial to convict a guy
for not doing
the thing that he's actually doing at
the moment
like at the moment that the jury will be
deliberating you know possibly
they'll actually be deliberating
whether they should punish him for not
doing
the thing he's doing doing in public
where everybody's watching at the same
time
that's where we're at
now I get there's a technical reason why
you'd have to be charged if you wanted
to be a complete
right and now let me ask you this
if the ban in trial turned into you know
him being railroaded and a January 6th
like crowd uh surrounded the courtroom
and there was violence that broke out
which nobody recommends I don't want to
see any violence would you say that was
a good thing a feature or a flaw
would that be a feature or a flaw if a
if a giant protest
with some actual danger broke out around
the courtroom
it's a feature it's a feature
right
and Mr Comey
let me tell you
you're not going to talk Americans out
of forming a crowd if you send a signal
that big
and the signal that big is that we've
just forgotten about what's good or
legal and it's just all about winning
and we don't care who we Crush in the
meantime
if that's the signal you're sending you
can expect a crowd
and so I'm not like some big you know
Steve Bannon supporter like you can do
his thing I do my thing
you know it's just different worlds I
don't have any connection really
so it's not about him
it's about the government
if the government is going to prosecute
and by the way I would say exactly the
same thing if he were a Democrat
right it wouldn't change if you were a
Democrat being prosecuted for not doing
the thing he's doing at the moment
I think I'd have something to say about
that
and I hope it would be exactly the same
but yeah if if a crowd forms around the
courtroom and some violence happens
because it always does when there's a
big crowd I mean somebody always gets
hurt I'm okay with it
I'm okay with it it's a feature
not on the floor
all right ladies and gentlemen
I think I've delivered the finest
entertainment that you could ever get
commercial free in this entire internet
I think that's a fact
and the feature not a flaw
there's still time yes there is
yeah give me a Diet Coke and by that I
mean put down a hit on everybody I don't
like
um
do you still wear a watch no I haven't
worn a watch for a long long time
can you imagine someone trying to tell
you what to do what
uh oh die Echo yeah Diet Coke has died
right in diet you're right
do red flag laws apply to citizens who
control nuclear weapons too that's a
good question do you think we should
have Biden looked into
because he has access to a weapon but
we've got some questions about his
mental capabilities
time time to activate that red flag law
um
can I provide guidance for how to
provide friction so a 15 year old
doesn't use cannabis until they're older
the answer is there's nothing you can do
about drugs and your children
the dynamos
I've never I've never seen anything now
you could be I suppose you could be a
hard ass and tell them what to do but
they have complete access to marijuana
there's no kid who doesn't have Total
Access
so if they want to do it
there's basically nothing you can do
you could try educating you could try
scaring them I guess I suppose you could
try scaring them I've never seen it work
there are lots of things you can try but
I've never seen anything work
kids make up their own ideas in the same
family you know you could have two kids
raised exactly the same one's a pie head
one doesn't want anything to do with it
how many of you ever seen that does
anybody have a family where one kid's a
pie head and the other one doesn't want
to have anything to do with it
right right well Lou the answer is yes
yes yes yes yes it's all individual if
you think that you're great parenting
is what's going to make the difference
in that
uh
you're going to be disappointed
no matter what you do you can have one
that likes it and one that doesn't and
they're going to act on their
preferences that's it
that's it yeah and you look at the
comments everybody's saying yup yup yup
it's only the people who haven't seen it
that think that's a thing
right I don't think there are many
things that are more cripplingly
negative in this world than the false
belief that good parenting is the big
solution
good parenting is necessary and
important
it's necessary and important and I'm not
going to minimize it but it's not magic
you know if you take this thing which is
necessary and you know really important
and you treat it that way that's great
but if you say it's magic
you know you're not really playing on a
on a real field here
um Steve Keane and Alexis no I haven't
somebody says that it's culture
more than parenting is it
I don't know
Maybe
maybe so
uh I have two siblings and I don't even
feel related to them yeah
you should not have over your kids
yeah right you should not have 100
control for your own kids
that would be worse yeah that would be
worse
watching a loved one deteriorate can
make you quit yeah but that's and that
again fear does work
fear is persuasive if if you can
irrationally scare somebody into it
I mean use your own ethical and moral
judgment about whether you do that to
your own kid it feels a little damaging
as well but
yeah I mean you could try
who says it's magic
Republicans often think that parenting
can fix things like drug use and
and they can't
I really can't
a minimum age for social media should be
21 or maybe even 25.
do you want something manipulating your
brain before your brain is formed
because your brain isn't formed until
25.
but as a as a society we've kind of set
it at 21 for important things so we
would probably conform to that 21.
um
yeah fear works I I don't like to
recommend fear persuasion because
there's a moral and ethical element to
that
you know because basically it might
require lies
right lying to your kids is supportable
it's just not it's just not ideal
by the way I have no problem with
parents lying to their kids for some if
it's for a good purpose
um
you have three kids and you're raising
them without electronics
you know I'd really love to see the
difference between kids raised by
electronics and not
because it's not like it's all positive
my senses that is more positive than
negative but I think there might be some
there might be some problems that are
unanticipated with that
um persuasion advice for someone new to
the workforce yes you're in sales
so you're new to the works of course and
you're in sales what do you do and the
answer is
you use reciprocity as your primary tool
so you find out what good things you can
do for a potential customer or a
customer and you'll see if you can
activate their reciprocity so doing more
than you're expected to do not just for
your boss but for your customer or
potential customers
is the
um
it's the main effect that's the main
persuasive thing to do
can you compromise with your kids like
if you get good grades you can smoke
weed nope
that sounds like somebody who's never
had any experience with a teenager
yeah here's here's doing a deal with a
teenager if if you get A's
you could smoke marijuana
yeah how does that work
kid gets b-plus
it says
well if I didn't have a bad teacher I
would have had an a
so
then you say well no the deal was A's
then the kid said I know but if I had a
better teacher I would have had an A so
I'm going to smoke anyway
right there's just there's no way you
can make a deal with a teenager
yeah can I say that directly there's no
such thing as a deal with a teenager if
you think of it as a like a practice
deal like you're you're training them to
understand the value of a deal
like it deals a deal
I I don't know where I got it but I've
always been a deal as a deal kind of
person like you'd have to be extreme
situation
for me to break a deal even if at the
end of it I wish I had not made that
deal I'm going to keep a deal
because that's the only way you can be
um I don't know you can be a
a complete person you can't be a
complete person if you can't keep your
deals because when somebody talks to you
they go I don't even know who you are
right
if you talk to somebody and you're not a
person who keeps your deals you know I
mean I said I'd do this and I did if
you're not that person people don't even
know who the hell you are I don't know
are you a person who shows up or a
person who doesn't show up I can't even
tell the difference right until you make
sure that people know you're a person
who does what you say you're going to do
they don't even know you you're just
like a a ball of you know
amorphous nothing
but let me let me deal with the most
important story on the internet and I
was prompted to do this I was going to
not
but unfortunately somebody made a
comment about it that cannot be ignored
there is a minister I think he's a
minister in Africa
and The Story Goes I'm just reporting
the story I'm not saying it's true or
untrue simply reporting it that he
believes he can cure people by sitting
on their face and farting in it
and that people go to his church and he
sits on their face and farts on their
face and uh cleanses them of
their evil spirits or whatever it is
now you might say to yourself
I don't believe that's true
I think I said that to myself too
but do you know why it's not true that
he sits on people's faces and farts in
them
because the story is
two on the nose
boom
yeah two on the nose
now
I would like to express some pure hatred
for the uh the Twitter user who thought
of that joke before I did
I hate you and love you in equal measure
I respect you oh I respect you
but I hate you for getting to that first
I'm a little bit competitive I'm a
little bit competitive
and how in the world did you beat me to
that
I mean really
I am a professional
the moment I saw that my fingers should
have started uh tweeting you know it's
too on the nose it's still on the nose
like how did you beat me to that
seriously did you see the uh there's
some reality show competition uh with
Kelly Clarkson where where she's
um who's the actress uh
you've all seen the clip where where
they're trying to guess the song on the
first few beats and then then if you
guess it correctly Anne Hathaway yeah
so Anne Hathaway she's competing with uh
Kelly why am I forgetting her name but
anyway it was her own song and Anne
Hathaway got it first and it was
freaking hilarious Kelly Clarkson so the
the song that came on was Kelly
Clarkson's own hit song
and uh Ed Hathaway got it in the first
beats and she got her first and she's
she starts belting out and it was also
funny because she can sing so Anne
Hathaway gets out there just belts out
uh Kelly Clarkson's own song
it was an amazing TV moment I don't know
if it was real
I mean I'm not entirely sure that was
unscripted but it was pretty good
right because Kelly Clarkson had asked
to play a song I know right all right
that is all we have for today
and
um
Anne Hathaway seems smarter than the
average she does she does
and can we agree this was possibly the
highlight of your day and the best thing
that's ever happened and can only get
better from here yes yes yes okay good
I'll talk to you later YouTube and
Spotify
