everybody
and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with scott adams it's
the best thing that's ever happened to
you in your whole damn life
and oh my god my phone just stopped
working
what is going on
holy cow
really
my
my phone just blew up
all right i'm gonna play something for
you in a minute but i gotta
get it fired up here
yeah you'll be glad i did boy will you
be happy
happiest day of your life
here it comes here it comes
ladies and gentlemen
today
will be one of the best days of your
entire life
because you're here with us and if you'd
like to take it up a notch
and i think you do i think you do
all you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker shells
to stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's a
dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
the simultaneous symptoms coming at you
now go
see that makes my technology all work
better now
so i wanted to uh play for you a
dramatic reading
staff it is my belief that you were
doing great and irreparable
by jack passovek of mark milley's
resignation letter
have you did you read mark milley's
resignation letter
so apparently he wrote a resignation
letter when he
was in the trump administration
and he did not deliver it so he didn't
resign
but we have access to the letter
it is the funniest letter
because
the first thing we learned is he's a
terrible writer
he doesn't look like a good general
frankly but he's a terrible writer but
jack passovek takes it to the next level
and he does he did a dramatic reading of
mark milne's resignation letter i'm just
going to play for you
just a just a small clip from that
arm to my country i believe that you
have made a concerted effort over time
to politicize the united states military
and thought that i could change that
but i've come to the realization that i
cannot and i need to step aside and let
someone else try i'm dead serious this
is exactly i'm reading it verbatim
mr president you're using the military
to create fear in the minds of people
and we are trying to protect the
american people i cannot stand idly by i
participate in that attack verbally or
otherwise on the american people the
american people trust their military we
cannot turn back it continues
uh
all right i won't play the whole thing
because you have to go see it
but you can see it in the jack basamic's
twitter feed uh or i retweeted it this
morning you can find it at the top of my
feed
that's really funny
i wish i'd thought of doing that because
because that worked perfectly
ah
let's talk about the good news before we
get to the fbi raid stuff of course
we'll be talking about that of course we
will
um i mentioned this before but i think
this is going to be the biggest deal in
the world
like actually the biggest
the biggest thing that's going to happen
in the world over the next 50 years
which is building cities from scratch
largely because our existing cities are
legacy and it's too hard to it's too
hard to change them into something
better they're all car-centric and
polluted and blah
but saudi arabia is building a
uh
this many miles long city it's like an
enclosed
structure
that will go for miles and miles in like
a straight line
and each little square within it
would be a living place where everybody
could walk to get everything they need
so there'd be no cars
no pollution
probably no crime
i'm guessing there'll be lots of
security cameras and stuff probably no
crime
and everything will be convenient and
clean
now
there you know skeptics say they'll
never build this thing but apparently
they already have approval
as one of ten cities modern cities that
are being designed around the world
so in 10 different places
people are trying to build a city from
scratch
where you do everything right now one of
the things that i think they're doing
the the saudi version
is
that the parts to build it will be
designed in the factory
so you don't have to cut it when it gets
there i think that's what they're saying
i'm reading between the lines but to me
that's the biggest deal
the biggest deal is
if you could make one little part of
this you know many miles long city
if you can make one little part of it
work perfectly
you just reproduce it
so i would think the economics of this
would be terrific i don't know we'll
wait and see maybe one of the ten will
get it right
well rasmussen asked the american public
what they thought about uh reinstituting
the military draft
military draft
i'm going to test my audience because i
know that you're
smarter than the average audience
so most of you have not seen the results
of the survey so i want to see how close
you can get
to guessing what percentage of the
american adults
think it would be a good idea to
reinstitute the military draft
oh my god
how do you do it
how do you do it
yeah you're so close 23
and 23 is nearly uh
that's nearly a quarter
which sometimes is
expressed as 25
yeah
now if you're new to my live streams you
may be impressed that this feat of
mental acuity
you should stay around if you're new
everybody who watches my live stream
long enough could have gotten that
answer right without knowing anything
about the survey itself
every one of you could have gotten that
answer right
yeah so the newcomers
stick around that's the sort of thing
you're going to learn
all right
um
the funniest tweet i've ever tweeted
was completely ignored
so i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you about it
because i don't like my best work to be
ignored
now
i'm going to ask you
after i after i explain it you tell me
this isn't my best work
but maybe maybe it was too subtle
all right so there's a tweet by
randy weingarten
you might know her as the head of the
biggest teachers union
and here's what she tweeted
she said the teacher shortage was bad
before this year but it's been made
worse by
culture wars the mask wars the
fabrication of crt
the shenanigans of politicians like
governor abbott in texas and governor
desantis in florida
so the head of the biggest teachers
union
is noting that there's just all kinds of
problems related to
schools you got your teachers shortages
you know teachers don't want to teach
and
mask wars and culture wars
crt wars
and then politics
and here's what i tweeted
i said that
one one person can make a difference
that's all
one person can make a difference
absolutely nobody got the joke
and i don't think you would have gotten
it necessarily except i queued it up so
you knew what to look for but
i i started to i started to tweet
find the common variable
because she's tweeting about all these
things going wrong and i'm thinking
what do they all have in common
her
the only thing they all have in common
is her
they're completely different topics
masks
masks culture wars
it's all different topics teachers don't
want to teach
it's all her
it's all her
it's systemic racism
it's her
we're not doing enough about climate
change
it's her
do you know why we're not doing enough
about climate change
because an entire
an entire uh i don't know several
generations of kids have been trained to
think that nuclear would kill him
she's basically the one person
who has more to do with destroying the
united states than anybody ever has
and so so when you ask can one person
make a difference in this world
yeah
yeah apparently barely one person can
make a difference
all right
that was my best work
alright so i tweeted today
time's up
now most people who follow me you
recognize that to be a follow-up to my
tweet
after the fbi raid and we were still in
the fog of war i said you know i give my
government 48 hours
to explain why it's why it did something
that
needs an explanation you know why did
the fbi raid a former president because
it looks like
a political act
don't know for sure
but it looks like it so in a case where
it looks so much like a political act
which would be the worst thing ever
uh
well maybe not ever
but
we we deserve an explanation do we not
now 48 hours went by and i have not
heard
what i would consider an adequate
explanation i do understand that he's
accused of doing something illegal with
documents
i do understand that if he did something
within a certain category it would be a
felony
and i do understand that our law
enforcement people are supposed to act
on
stuff like that
but of course you have precedent you
have other people where the fbi didn't
act maybe it wasn't it was a misdemeanor
then so maybe it's different but there's
lots to explain
now for 48 hours i was open to the
possibility
that they might have an explanation
maybe just because i couldn't imagine
one
that doesn't mean it didn't exist
because it could be just a lack of
imagination
i can't imagine any reason why this
would be
appropriate but maybe
so you wait two days
of course the country
is you know is complaining
of course the fbi and department of
justice know
that the country is not happy about this
so where is our response
has anybody seen any kind of a
official response
i haven't
right
and so what do you do when you have a
completely reasonable expectation
not a requirement i mean i can't i can't
impose a deadline on the government but
wouldn't you say that 48 hours is a
perfectly reasonable standard
for somebody to say something
i would even allow that maybe they could
follow up later and add some details
they forgot but
something
now what do you do
in the absence of that
something phase two
so phase two has begun
phase one was waiting for the fog of war
to clear up and just see what they said
just you know be open to there might be
some other side to the story
we're beyond we're beyond that now
it's obvious at this point that whatever
we hear will be just cooked up
because you it doesn't take that long to
tell the truth
it doesn't take long to tell the truth
if the people who who were in charge or
believed that this was a good play
that they had done something that the
country would be happy with
they'd be talking about it all day long
would they not
can you think of a reason that the
government would not tell you more
information
if they were proud of what they had done
if they thought they did good work you
don't think they'd be telling it
who doesn't tell you they did good work
especially a you know government
organization of course
so
while we still don't know
the whole situation we can move to phase
two
and phase two is where you lock in an
assumption
that there has been
criminal or inappropriate activity
so at this point we should as reasonable
consumers of the news
and as reasonable watch
watchdogs of our own government we can
move to phase two
and phase two is the assumption of guilt
now they could still
defend themselves there's nothing to
stop them from tomorrow
giving me a good set of reasons where i
say oh i wish you said that earlier
but i understand why you waited and
those are pretty good reasons
i'd be open to that
totally open to it but phase two we have
entered phase two is the assumption of
guilt
by the fbi department of justice and the
white house now there are some denials
about whether the white house knew about
it
i don't care
do you
i don't think it's relevant that they
denied it
um because we're in a mode where just
people are gonna deny anything so
denials don't mean anything at this
point
you know 48 hours without
a statement
nothing they say after this is going to
hold too much credibility
now
what should you do
like actually do
in a world in which
it appears that the fbi and the
department of justice have weaponized
against a segment of the population
what is the proper response to that
well when i when i tweeted that we had
entered phase two
i got two
reactions pretty excited reactions from
my critics
and they were opposites which is weird
so there was a whole bunch of critics
who come in and i think i think these
group are
maybe paid trolls because there's
something that a certain group of
critics always say
that sounds like it's a cookie cutter
like they have instructions of what to
say
and they usually pile in and say
something about garfield or some other
comic
to make to to minimize any impact i have
so
part of my critics are saying
hey cartoon boy
go draw garfield you know which of
course i don't draw
and the point of it is that
i have
no
no influence on anything i'm just a
cartoonist
and so i should be dismissed you've seen
those right some of you following me on
twitter and there's a lot of those
at the same time that my critics are
telling me that i'm
uh toothless and over the hill and
irrelevant
um i got an excited comment from this
guy uh
what's his name
schwab
walter no schaub
walter schaab and he he's the senior
ethics fellow
and a former director of the office of
government ethics
so he was quite concerned this is what
he said about my statement that time's
up
he said you're trying to incite violence
but you're too much of a coward to say
it you'll hint and hint and then when
the violence starts you'll pretend to
condemn it
that's cowardice
no need to argue just embrace the
cowardice
to which i say
would it be cowardice to incite a
revolution
in public
i feel like
the word coward doesn't mean what it
used to mean
because i'm not exactly hiding
am i
so what kind of weird
weird accusation is it that i'm a coward
so i you know tried to explain to him
the following
i tried to explain
that the
the implied risk of violence
is what makes everything work
everything the reason the legal system
works when it does the you know the
justice system is because of the implied
threat of violence
if you don't go to court somebody with a
gun is going to go get you
right
the military works because the implied
threat of violence or actual violence
and i would argue that every human
interaction with another man
is is gated by the threat of violence
even if you don't talk about it even if
it's not on your mind and somebody
somebody complained to me and said scott
scott scott
you know when i talk to my father
i'm not i'm not concerned about
like violence
to which i say really
try it try pulling your father's pants
off and shoving your fingers up his ass
does he complain or does he hit you
no he hits you
because all of the things that you're
allowed to do are the things that your
father allows you to do
before he's willing to punch the
out of you
you are always
always gated in your actions
by the implied threat of violence
this is no different
this is just business as usual am i
inciting violence
no
no
i'm simply saying that all options are
on the table
because they always are
if you say all options on the table are
you saying go be violent no you're just
saying it's always there
not only is it always there i couldn't
take it back if i wanted to
could i could i remove my threat of
violence
if i wanted to
no
you could not it's not removable
why because if you piss me off enough
i'm going to be violent
there's there's no you can't take that
back
what am i going to change my nature
i'm i'm bored this way
and i would think that almost all of you
are born the same way yeah jordan
peterson does a much better job of
explaining this point of view
so i'm not i'm not copying his point of
view
but i'm inspired by it so don't blame
him if i say something he doesn't say
that's that's all
but he is he is my influence in this
point of view
um
so
here's what i think about the risk of an
armed revolution
no way
we're not even close
you could completely stop worrying about
it in my opinion
but
is it useful
that people who might want to try to
push the boundaries of your
flexibility
is it useful that they know it's always
there
i think it is
i think it's useful to know that there
is a line
and that if you cross it there will be
violence
now i don't think that line has been
crossed
that's my opinion and i don't think it's
close i don't think it's a close call
but
it's always there
and i'm not going to apologize for it
and i'm not going to take it back
here's a little advice
much of my audience is conservative and
republican
let me give you some advice to any
democrats who might have wandered in
if the republicans and the conservatives
are still complaining
you're fine
you're fine
as long as you hear the republicans and
conservatives just yap yap yap yap
complain
complain you're fine there's not going
to be any revolution
do you know when you should worry
does that anybody want to fill in the
rest of the sentence
tell them tell the democrats when they
should worry
when the talking stops
yeah
when the talking stops you better
 hide
[Laughter]
or
or join the team that has all the guns
because if the talking stops
that's when i'd get worried
right but we're nowhere near that we're
not even close to that we're not in the
same solar system as anything like that
but let's be let's be adults about it
the adult opinion is that violence is
always an option
and if you want to take the child view
that you can take violence out of
civilization and still make it work
explain to me how that works
explain to me how well san francisco is
working when the threat of
jail has gone away you know jail is a
form of violence i would argue that jail
is violence
it's just a different kind
all right
so
let's be clear
that we live in a civilization where
even if it was your best intention to
remove all
threat of violence from civilization you
wouldn't do it if you could
because everything would fall apart
all right
so
what do you do about it
let me ask you
do you think one person could make a
difference
on this topic
now obviously if it's trump he makes a
difference duh
but do you think that one person in the
public
who's not elected
could make a difference
probably
in my opinion one person is the only
thing that makes a difference
so i think that old saying is you know
the idea that one person can't make a
difference
is almost as completely wrong as
anything ever has been
i mean i would argue that steve jobs
made apple
you know even though everybody
worked on the same projects and stuff
but
everything is just one person gets
something going and then it picks up
steam or it doesn't right
jesus is an example
i saw some examples like muhammad jesus
and
george soros
elon musk yeah elon musk can make a
difference so yeah there's all kinds of
examples where one person can make a
difference
um how many of you think some kind of a
big national breakup is coming
like an actual armed revolution is there
anybody here who thinks that's actually
like a risk
it really isn't it really isn't
but
have i ever told you that the best way
to look at life is as energy
you know watch where the energy goes
the the worst way to understand anything
is to look at the logic
yeah that's another way to tell you the
things i've been telling you forever
the
if you want to understand what's going
to happen next
or even understand what's happening now
the last thing you want to look at is
the rational
explanation of it
what you want to look for is the energy
because if the energy builds up
somewhere it's got to go somewhere
energy doesn't disappear right if
there's one thing we know
energy goes somewhere you're either
you're either gonna
bring it into your body and make
yourself sick with stress
or you're gonna put it into the world
and maybe get yourself beaten up
but it's going somewhere
where is it going to go
see the trouble is this fbi raid on
trump
gave more energy to an energy monster
you know trump eats energy it's making
him stronger and there's no question
about it at this point
even the left
is saying it directly
uh-oh
i think this makes him stronger
because it does and he's playing it
perfectly by the way the entire trump
family
is playing the story perfectly
they really are and the whole thing
about melania's closet
well that didn't come from the fbi
whoever started talking about melania's
closet
yeah i i have a feeling that what you
would really find out
is that there might be there might be a
safe in the same closet
because that's not an uncommon place to
put a safe in a closet
am i wrong
does anybody have a does anybody have a
safe in the closet like a master closet
it's fairly common right jewelry etc
yeah so my guess is my guess is that
we'll find out later that they were not
rummaging through her her underwear
drawer
i don't think
maybe but i don't think so i think
they're going to find out they went into
rooms that there might have been some
storage and that's probably it
but
the trump family is playing it perfectly
because as soon as you throw in that
cross-dressing
edgar j hoover
like in your mind suddenly the fbi
agents are wearing women's clothing
all right you you tell me you did not
imagine the fbi agents wearing women's
clothing
you did
you imagined the fbi agents the men
trying on melania's dresses it's the
most visual persuasion of all time
you know i told you that trump saying
build the wall was good persuasion
because the wall is a
even in your mind it's it's a it's a
visual
but there is nothing more visual
than fbi agents trying on melania's
dresses now it didn't happen but your
mind can't help it you just can't help
it you just put those things together
i'm sorry i can't help seeing it and of
course don jr
helpfully has
he helpfully
tweeted a meme that shows those uh
alleged fbi
plants and some earlier protests but
they're they're dressed in women's
clothing
it's a pretty good meme yeah and then
you add the j edgar hoover allegation
that you like to dress in the women's
clothing not that there's anything wrong
with that
by modern standards
um
but it all it all makes the story
conflated your mind so
i would say that the
trump benefit
from this is so obvious and strong
that it makes you wonder if
there isn't something else to this story
huh
let's see is there something else to the
story
oh it seems that
there was some kind of insider that the
fbi had
inside mar-a-lago who had given them
information about what alleged um
confidential documents over there
allegedly hidden
from i don't know whoever
and allegedly where to get them
and they're referring to this person
have you have you heard what they refer
to this person this insider
what do they call this insider there's
another word they're using
the mole
the mole
the mole
let me wind you back in the wayback
machine right
to roughly
2016 or 17
when
the hillary clinton campaign was so
incompetent in their messaging and their
slogan earring that i suggested there
might be
a mole
working for the the clinton campaign who
was pretending to be on their side
but always giving them bad suggestions
like for example remember hillary
clinton
had the slogan
it's her turn
now does that sound like somebody who is
really on her side came up with that
it doesn't does it it sounds exactly
like a prank
it sounded like there was a mole who was
in the room and said
i got an idea
you know what they're really going to
like
they're going to like if they say your
gender is what makes you get elected try
it's her turn
that that will go over well people love
to hear
that it's just your turn
they don't want to hear what you can do
for the country or why you're better
than the other candidate they just need
to know it's your turn because you're a
woman
try that
now you tell me that that doesn't sound
exactly like it was a prank
i can't even imagine the room where they
thought that was a good idea unless
somebody had led them to it in a
malicious way
so now we hear
that the
mole
the mole
was in the uh
was that mar-a-lago
told the fbi exactly where to look
for the hidden documents
put uh let's let's let's put two and two
together here
if it comes out if it turns out that the
fbi did
get documents that are damning in some
way
what would we say about the story
afterwards
we'd say well that mole
certainly did not like donald trump
that's for sure
that was a mole who did not like that
president
that's what i'd say
good job mole
you mold just right
but
suppose
just hypothetically
suppose that the fbi ended up with no
documents of any consequence whatsoever
except maybe some technical violation of
handling documents
suppose there's a whole big
nothing what would you say then about
the mole
whose team would you assume
the mole
was on
because this is working out really well
for trump in a way that's hard to ignore
am i right
so i'm not going to allege i do not
allege that the mole
is like the real mole you know somebody
who's actually working for trump as
opposed to
against
but i will simply point out
that the outcome looks exactly like
something a mole would do
now do you remember my prediction did
some of you see my prediction early on
in the in the 48 hour period after the
raid
did anybody see my tweets in which i
said
the search for an underling to blame has
begun
here we are
so as of today msnbc
the you know the news entity you you
associate most closely with you know
owned by the democrats
um
they explained that
that garland
who is a democrat
so garland the head of the department of
justice a democrat they say he didn't
know anything about it
so the democrat who was in charge didn't
know anything about it how about the
white house
didn't know anything about it yeah no no
that's the way it's supposed to work
they're not supposed to tell the white
house
right they didn't tell the white house
they were going to raid
trump now i do understand that you're
not supposed to tell the white house in
general
but
they raided trump
that's not business as usual
so maybe they didn't tell the white
house it is possible
do you know who they decided is the one
they're going to pin it on
christopher wray
do you know why
he was appointed by trump
and do you know what the christopher ray
excuse is going to be
because you know it's coming
do you know what it's going to be
it was more like a bureaucratic
mess up
because what the fbi wanted to do
was to make it the lowest profile action
they could
you know get there early in the morning
and then be gone
and if they had done it at a low key
you wouldn't have even noticed let me
suggest how it could have gone
keep in mind that mar-a-lago is
controlled by the secret service
give me a fact check but that's true
right
because ex-presidents get security so
wouldn't it be true
that mar-a-lago is guarded full-time by
secret service right now the news is
that the secret service was of course
the first to be alerted
about the fbi's raid because you want
the secret service to be you're
coordinating and not be surprised
okay
so we know that they coordinated so now
tell yourself what is the least amount
of visibility that the fbi could have
applied to this if they wanted to
remember
secret service already controls the
premise
they already control it
so all you have to do is get them on
your side and you have full access as
much as you want
what fbi agent and one safe cracker if
he even needed a safe cracker because i
feel like you could have asked asked for
the combination
doesn't that work that way
if you have a warrant can't you ask the
person who knows the combination to just
open the safe
there might have been some stalling so
maybe they just bring the safe cracker
because it's easier
so
the smallest number of people they could
have done this with is just two
literally just drive up
two people in the car
they don't even have to wear special
jackets
two people in the car drive up
talk to the
secret service
they say you know can you make sure
everything's secure in there
and then when you're sure everything's
secure
we'd like to go in and we're going to
look for these you know three places
here's my piece of paper and then the
secret service walks them to the safe
they say all right your warrants is safe
in master bedroom okay let's go look at
that
you tell me why they couldn't do it with
two people
were they expecting violence
no because the secret service owns the
property for all practical purposes
right so there was no risk of violence
it doesn't look like it required a lot
of people to carry anything away because
they weren't they weren't talking about
storage of boxes and boxes they were
talking about a few documents it sounds
like maybe a box
right
now let's get back to the criticism
that it was a bureaucratic up
it looks like it to me
it does look like if they try to sell
this as a bureaucratic mistake
it will look exactly like that they can
sell that here's why
it looks like the local office got too
many people involved
and then it turned into something it
wasn't
imagine this story if two fbi agents
showed up
with a warrant
worked with the secret service got
everything they wanted and then left
with you know a little handful of stuff
what would that story look like that
story would look like
some people did their job
because there does seem to be a credible
a credible allegation that he has some
documents that
legally should be somewhere else
so you wait till the president's not
there
you send the smallest number of people
because you already control
you know the house
you just get it done
now because it was trump you end up with
the local police force right lights and
action and everything else going on so i
think
i think that even if rey
approved it
that what he thought he was approving
was something you'd barely notice
i think he may he may have this is just
speculation but i think he may have said
all right
if you're going to keep it like really
small
basically you're just going to go in and
get some documents while he's not there
but you know it's hosted
you know in and out clean
but instead
it looks like the bureaucracy had to do
with the bureaucracy did they have you
know a set of rules that they use in
every situation and so they go in big
because i think when you do an fbi raid
you usually go in big so there's no
trouble right
can somebody confirm that
wouldn't the strategy of going in big
be to suppress any pushback like you go
in with overwhelming force and lights
and people with guns and stuff and
everybody just goes
whatever you want
whatever you want right
is that not the point yeah i think
that's part of the strategy so if you
have a special case where that's
completely unnecessary
because the secret service is going to
be on your side
it's completely unnecessary
but it might have happened anyway
because the bureaucracy required it
right the bureaucracy is just going to
do what it always does
it might not make an exception
for this situation
so i think that the democrats are going
to have an actual argument
that it was the bureaucracy gone wild
and all they were doing is trying to get
some documents back now
they can sell that
you might not buy it
but it is sellable
so watch for that coming it seems like
that's where it's gonna
come
out all right um
and then here's what i expect i expect
there's nothing damning in those
documents
what do you think
i say there's nothing
damning in the documents
i don't think anything will be found
the other thing that the trumps are
doing that's brilliant is
suggesting that the fbi might be
planting evidence
that really is perfect
if this ever happened to you
and you know and you weren't there to
watch the fbi do the work the very first
thing you should say
is that i suspect they planted evidence
as a persuasion and a legal strategy
you do this right away
you right away the first thing you say
is my god nobody was there they could
have planted anything
and then you say they have a history of
doing exactly this do you know why
because they have a history
of of using fake information to get what
they want a recent history you don't
have to wonder i wonder if anybody in
the fbi would ever you know
invent any evidence
yes
that's the court has demonstrated that's
exactly what happened
exactly what happened
so
um
trump is just playing this perfectly
persuasion wise i mean he's just killing
it
all right
is there anything else happening
it feels like this is the only news
right
now if it's the only news
now the one thing i didn't talk about is
this attorney and his connection to
epstein i didn't talk about it enough
the
the only thing you should take away from
the attorney's connection to epstein
is that he would be in theory
and i'll add in theory so it's not an
accusation
in theory
such a person would be the most
blackmailable person in the world
in theory
because you would imagine that nobody
would help them unless they've gotten
some benefits themselves
you know what i mean
now i'm not alleging that i'm saying
that's the first thing you'd assume
it doesn't mean it's true
but your mind goes there immediately so
is it a coincidence that the most
hypothetically black available judge in
all in all the world
is the one behind the actual warrant
i know here's the other thing that you
have to ask yourself about
my understanding is that the warrant was
showed to
the attorneys for trump
but they were not allowed to hold the
copy
is that what's being reported i don't
know that's true
that's been i think it's being reported
now you don't think that the attorneys
got to look at it long enough
to have an idea what what is said
because trump's attorneys are acting
like they don't know what's on it
am i right now i get that they don't
want to paraphrase it
because if you're an attorney you might
not want to paraphrase it incorrectly or
something you know you want to be
specific so attorneys need the document
like that's just built into their dna
you know don't talk about a document get
the document
somebody talking about a document
doesn't mean much a document might mean
something
so you can see why the lawyers don't
want to talk about a document
that
that could potentially be held in your
hand which would be the better outcome
however
however
if i were uh
if that if the warrant said things that
i wanted the public to hear
i would tell the public right away
because that's how you manage the public
opinion
so if trump's lawyers saw something on
the warrant that was absurd
i feel like we'd know it by now
am i right
if something on there said
we need to check under your mattress or
just some dumb ass thing that made no
sense you'd know that
somebody would have leaked that
but if all it says is something like we
want to check your safes because you we
think you have some documents that you
shouldn't have
you don't think the lawyers for trump
read that and knew exactly what it meant
and there was no no ambiguity at all
oh
you're looking in these three places
for these specific documents
you don't think you don't think trump's
lawyers know what the the warrant said
of course they do
they were shown the warrant
they read it
they have memories they're attorneys
they can remember stuff
right now not telling you
what they know
is probably a good strategy
it's probably great strategy because if
they don't tell you what's on there your
imagination will fill it in with the
worst case scenario
have i ever taught you that
persuasion-wise
here's a persuasion tip
that i'll embed in this live stream
if you can keep people wondering
they will create more energy
because it's the not knowing that makes
your brain spin ah what what exactly is
in that warrant it must be bad if
they're not showing oh my god it's so
bad two days have gone by and they're
not even showing us the work wow that
must be so bad
so as long as as long as trump and the
lawyers can maintain the story that
nobody knows what's in the warrant
which is obviously false
that the trump team knows exactly what
was in the warrant at least
you know in concept they don't they
still need the document to share it with
you which would make sense but they know
of course they know
now um i'm being questioned that there's
nothing in the warrant
that explains why they're doing it and i
disagree
i agree that that's not the intention of
the warrant
so the intention of the warrant is not
to tell you why they're doing it so that
part you're correct
but where i disagree is that when they
tell you what they're looking for that
tells you why they're there
i need somebody to
who's a lawyer to disagree with me on
this right
okay i agree and i'm a lawyer thank you
so for example if the warrant said
we're we're going to check three places
for these documents which we think you
shouldn't have and we list the documents
you don't think the lawyers saw that
probably
if they tell you what they're looking
for specifically and where they're
looking
that kind of tells you what they're
looking for
now
now somebody says the logic is flawed
uh i'm not done i'm not done
that does not eliminate the possibility
that they say they're looking for one
thing
but they're sort of hoping they're going
to find another thing am i right is that
why you wanted to tell me that they can
pretend they're looking for a but
they're really looking for b they're
just fishing
right
so
so those those factors all after good so
here's my assumption
i believe that the trump
team does not want you to know what
they're looking for yet
because the longer you're
thinking about it the more energy you're
building up in your minds and they need
that energy
trump wants you to have energy around
this question
so if he told you the answer you'd say
okay that sounded reasonable maybe
it might drain your energy away so he's
keeping it high
they all knew what they were looking for
yeah there's a lot of people who knew
what they were looking for but we are
told that it's just some documents that
are not relevant to the legal case
we're told it's just documents that have
some security
impact
so here's a question i asked
is there any reason that the trump team
did not negotiate
to keep the originals and let them take
copies
does the national archive require the
original
or could you negotiate so let's say that
one of the items was a handwritten
letter
from kim jong-un to trump
let's just say that was one of the items
if the if the archives have a perfect
digital image of it
do they need the original
let's say you just wanted to keep a
keepsake
because you know it might be valuable at
some point but it'd certainly be
interesting to see it framed
just wondering all right
um what should you do
about this situation
do any of you feel like you need to act
because of this situation
you do know that 95 percent of the
people are not even aware of what
happened like they've heard there was a
raid but they don't care
most of the country doesn't care about
this at all
this is very much fuel it's sort of like
an august story
slow news month
so so we get these manufactured stories
in august
so here's what you don't need to do
you don't need to clean your weapons and
start marching on the capitol
can i say that as clearly as possible
because there are people who are
you know trying to characterize me as
inciting violence i want to be as clear
as i can
there is no cause for violence in what
we're seeing
not even close
not even close because we have regular
mechanisms to take care of it
we do we got elections coming up you
can't do any better than an upcoming
election
if you want to change something
the dumbest thing to do would be to get
your weapons
a month before an election
nothing would be dumber than to stage an
insurrection
right before a re a probable red wave
election
you could not be dumber than that
so don't be dumb
now
let's say there was a red wave
except the polls show that it was the
opposite and the democrats held power
and won everything
2022 and 2024.
well i have questions
then we have questions about our
election security
right
but we might be at a point where
trump could win a re-election
by such a margin that cheating would be
just too hard you just couldn't get away
with it
all right
and it does seem to me that the swing
swing districts are going to be quite
criticized or quite scrutinized
um
somebody changed their affiliation to
democrat just to be safe
that's not a bad idea
to re-register as democrat
just for
safety
that's not a bad idea it really isn't
actually i might do that
that's not a bad idea i think i might
register as democrat what would you say
would anybody object to that
if you heard that i registered as a
democrat
but i you know i talk the same every
everything's the same i just registered
as a democrat because i've actually
thought if i ran for office i would run
as a democrat
because it would be easy
running as a democrat is the easiest
thing in the world
and i could get republican votes fairly
easily you know you don't get most
but i could get enough do you know how
easy it would be to get republican votes
show them respect
i'm done
i'm done i just got 20 percent of
republican votes
show them respect that's it
that's it twenty percent of the vote
uh there nothing could be easier than
winning an election as a democrat
you literally just have to show a little
bit of respect to the other team's
opinion that's it
and they'll let you in
i i think that was bill clinton's genius
you know he did the triangulating thing
where he tried to be you know not quite
a democrat not quite a republican so
everybody would find something to like
that worked easily
i would say that bill clinton showed
republicans respect
tell me i'm wrong
yes or no
bill clinton
showed republicans respect
i believe he did i believe he did yeah
and i think it was actually
um honest
now i'm not going to call politicians
honest but i think i think bill clinton
coming from a southern state
being you know more of a conservative
democrat i think it was an honest
respect i do
and i think it came across that way
now
compare that to hillary clinton calling
the other side deplorables and anything
that
you know and then there was a you know
obama with his clingings their bibles
and guns and right
the the mistakes that the democrats make
are just so obvious
that they're like these gigantic easy to
avoid mistakes oh
all i have to do is treat them with
respect
the way i would like to be treated
and then i can be
president of the united states
yep yep that's all you have to do
treat him with a little respect
and then you could be president of the
united states
i could absolutely become president as a
democrat it would be that easy
but
i would also have to show complete
respect to aoc's point of view which i
do have
believe it or not
i have complete respect for the aocs and
even the elon omars in a way
there's
there's some sketchiness to her opinions
but here's what i like about them
i like the ones who are saying we have
to blow up the whole system
because it's not working
and
i think if you showed them respect and
said you know what i like that thinking
so much i'm not i can't see how you can
make that work
but can we come up with a small test of
it
can we see if your idea has some merit
maybe we'll build a little community see
if it works
run it your way if we learn anything
well we'll take that forward but if you
say aoc you're crazy
everything you say is a bad idea
that's no way to be president
the way to be president to say that's
that's more radical than we've thought
through
but i can help you
get to the other side of this
let's just test it
why would you complain about that
it's so easy to win the presidency
if
if i showed you how easy it would be
you're going to wonder why nobody did it
before i mean so easily and i would
argue that
oh here's another one
um did reagan and i i was maybe not
paying attention as much during the
reagan era
did reagan show respect
to the other team
did reagan show respect
to liberals now he always demonized
liberals but it was more of the liberal
point of view wasn't it
because i feel like reagan was more
about the philosophy he was attacking
than the people
but me but maybe i just don't remember
it right
yeah there were reagan democrats exactly
you worked well with tip o'neill
yeah in those days things were a little
bit more collegiate so maybe that's a
bad comparison
yeah he mocked he mocked liberals for
their point of view
but that's very different than mocking
them for being
you know clinging to bibles and guns and
being deplorable
like reagan never called liberals
deplorable they
yeah
all right
mocking mocking the other side's ideas
perfectly
perfectly good
but going after the people is what the
new democrats have done recently
and
that's not a winning combination in the
long run
now how many of you um
will just
would accept the following
point of view
we've never been stronger as a country
every generation thinks that
everything's falling apart
you know i was watching i mentioned this
before but i was watching newt
gingrich's
he's got a show about washington george
washington it's called the first
american i believe i forgot to i didn't
know the title the first time i talked
about it so it's called the first
american
and when you find out um how close
washington was washington was to losing
everything his army at one point was
just like 2500 people
2500 barefoot people with no ammunition
you know things were were pretty grim
but the united states has been teetering
on the brink of extinction
for those first hundred years
right we've got your civil wars et
cetera
and the 60s if you live through the 60s
it looked like the whole country was
coming apart
but it didn't
if you look at anything that we've
experienced in our you know hundreds of
years of history and then you compare it
to what's happening today what's
happening today is people getting mad on
twitter
there's literally nothing happening that
would get you anywhere near a civil war
when when the country talks about oh we
need a
national divorce and
everything that's what the states are
you can go to a state you like
and it'll happen over time right so you
don't need a national divorce
if everybody can just have multiple
lovers
worst analogy ever the states are like
your multiple lovers right yeah if you
don't like new hampshire you always have
texas
you don't like florida well you got
california
so yeah as long as you have
diversification and multiple lovers you
don't need to break the whole thing
just find another lover
corporations have too much power
maybe
but i wonder what the world would look
like if they didn't
so
you know i get the idea that
corporations have too much power blah
blah blah everybody agrees on that
but what would it look like if they
didn't
because i don't think we ever count the
good things that corporations do
which are amazingly good
you know we talk about their pollution
and their whatever
white-collar crimes and stuff
but
i think corporations have really moved
society forward
overall
the transnationals do not have loyalty
well that's true but they don't need it
market competition is better than
loyalty
um iran sent a hitman for john bolton
and mike pompeo somebody's saying is
that in the news
the news isn't reporting that is it
really
how did i miss that
well
interesting what what would you assume
to be true if that news is surfacing now
it feels like a build-up to war doesn't
yeah that feels like a build-up to war
because i don't know that that
information gets out accidentally
that feels like the most top-secret
secret
stuff you could ever have
multiple reports
wow
i don't know do you think that iran
would be dumb enough to do that now
given
granted we took out their generals
but
do you think they would
maybe i'm not going to rule it out
but it would be a terrible strategy
because
the united states would have to
basically change their leadership if
that happened
day before yesterday
oh as a
as a payback for a solar money
yeah
oh so there's a reward out for killing
them that's a little different
a reward out for killing them is a
little different than sending a hitman
that's that's different it's not good
but it's definitely different
that sounded more like wishful thinking
it would unify their country well it
would unify the country but their
government would be vaporized
it's a contract not a reward
no it's a contract okay
well if it's a contract for somebody
specific to do it and that's pretty four
hit men were identified four specific
ones
i'll be darned
remember when ollie north uh got the
government to pay for some security at
his home
and there was a big question about that
because he thought al qaeda was going to
try to kill him or some something
and it sounded silly
that wasn't silly
all right
well i thought if if iran wanted to
start the end time
war
they would have already done it so i
think that the iranians their leadership
is probably looking at the same risks as
anybody else would
all right
well that ladies and gentlemen
concludes
the best live stream you've ever seen
i'm going to get back to mocking my
critics
the ones who are making bad garfield
references to me
i've invited everybody who is a failed
writer or
an unsuccessful artist
to make comments today about my uh one
one level of my skill stack and boy are
they
so every whenever i get them today i'm
just gonna retweet
my invitation for them to do it
oh my mascot came back i was worried
that keith olbermann maybe was injured
or dead
but he came back today
so he's
he's he's on me again today
and
my mascot
is awesome
all right well if i can get keith
olbermann to be mad at me on twitter
it's a good day
okay
the dilbert you helped with was
published today good
oh about the one about not getting
everything back in the packaging
yeah that did come from i think that
didn't come from you
pardoning would be genius pardoning who
so
there's a lot of noise about andrew tate
is anybody watching all the uh the
attention he's getting andrew tate
he's kind of fascinating because he's um
if you don't know him just imagine uh
andrew dice clay
but without the without the creativity
but with the strong homoerotic
undertones
yeah
so just imagine andrew dice clay
but homoerotic
now i'm not saying he's gay i'm just
saying that's the that's how he that's
how he presents himself
so
he's doing a good job of getting
attention
but
being the
andrew dice clay jr
with homoerotic overtones
i don't know i don't know how far that
can take him but it's taken him pretty
far so far
uh the nation in decline video uh it
bored me
i tried to watch the
video i guess trump did a nation in
decline and tried to tie it to the fbi
raid i don't know it bored me
uh did i mention dark brandon well it's
so weak that you know the democrats
try to do what republicans do
um
they try to take the negative stuff and
turn it into positives because trump
does that all the time but they can't
quite do it
yeah this whole dark brandon thing is
trying to make biden look awesome which
is directly copying you know the maga
people
treating trump as like a you know god
warrior kind of thing
they're just not good at it
oh the inflation story
the inflation story was hilarious
so joe biden getting up there and saying
i've got one number to tell you about
inflation
zero
we had zero inflation
and then everybody said uh
inflation is up 8.5 percent
but what he meant is it didn't get any
worse than that
now is it technically accurate
that if your inflation rate is 8.5
percent
and it doesn't get bigger than that
that you've ended inflation
i i feel like
that was the sort of data that the
president should have a little firmer
grasp on
is there inflation or no
now here's how i interpret it
if you had a one-time price increase of
8.5 percent
and then nothing ever increased after
that
well then yes that would be the end of
inflation
so i think that's how biden understood
it
i think he understood it as prices went
up but now they're not going up anymore
however that's not what that 8.5 means
what it means is that's a rolling
forever everything's going up 8.5
you know as we go now that gets revised
every month when you see your actuals
but
yeah
the fact that that 8.5 stayed stable
is the opposite of not having inflation
that would be having a lot of inflation
tons of it 8.5 is a lot
um
yeah
uh please don't get distracted from esg
so esg i've got a week or more of comics
coming on that topic i think that's
september you'll see those and i'll talk
more about that
then
do you other do i ever jam with other
musicians only my
drum teacher who plays the guitar
so we do jam
my lesson is mostly jamming these days
the inflation reduction act is in
trouble because of the fbi raid is it i
don't know
have i bought a new guitar no probably
for christmas
all right
i need a basis you're right
uh
an open
jam
i don't think i'm up to quite jamming
with anybody except my
music teacher right now
all right that's all i got for now and
i think you'd agree this is the best
live stream you've ever seen
and
what about dreams
uh we'll get to that
and now
i say goodbye to youtube and i'm going
to talk a little bit more to the locals
people bye for now
