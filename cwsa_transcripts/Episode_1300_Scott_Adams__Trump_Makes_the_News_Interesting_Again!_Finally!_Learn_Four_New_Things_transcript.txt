[Applause]
hey everybody
come on in come on in finally
finally we've been starving for
something
interesting in the news to talk about
what was missing yeah i think you know
it was big and it was orange and it's
back
we're going to talk about it but first
we've got to do something really really
important it's called the simultaneous
sip
a lot of people try to start their day
without it and i'm here to report
that throughout history and
i'm not making this up this is this is
actually true
99 of all the people
who have ever died from the beginning of
time
did not do the simultaneous step
that's a real statistic over 99 percent
of all the people who have ever died
since the beginning of time did not do
this simultaneous sip
so i think that means something it means
it's time for the simultaneous zip and
all you need is a copper bungee glass
a tanker jealous to sign a canteen jug
flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopey mean hit of the day
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sep and it
happens now
go
now check check did anybody die
right right i'll bet not a single one of
you died
while you were sipping i'll bet not one
now can you make that claim about let's
say riding bicycles
no no people die doing that can you make
that claim about
just about anything no but the
simultaneous sip
unbroken record try to beat that
you can't well i've promised you
that i'm going to make as my trademark
talking about what's new
by using it as an excuse
to teach you something you didn't know
or to reinforce something that
it's worth hearing again and so
let's do that trump was at cpac
last night giving his speech and
i'll tell you you don't realize
how good he is until he's been going a
while
now when i say good i will allow that
his critics are saying
oh no and that that's not you know
good for them so clearly there's a
subjective
part of this but if you were simply to
measure
star power uh just star power
just nobody is close
is there any who would even be number
two
who would be the second most i don't
know if charismatic or star power is the
right word
but who would be second can he even
think of anybody who would be
second you know you have to you have to
go to aoc to get somebody who's even got
like some spark right but i don't think
so
oh obama okay but of the people who are
likely to
you know try to run for president
and some of the magic that trump brings
is that he
can't be uninteresting he just
doesn't know how to be uninteresting
do you know what would have been easy
for him to do
he could have looked at all the things
he's ever been fact checked on
and just not do those things he could
look at
all the things he'd ever done that
caused people to
call him a racist and whatever else
they're going to call him
and he could have just not done those
things it would be easy to know what to
not do
how many of the things that that
you would have thought to yourself well
i i certainly
if i were him he says all these things i
like oh
i think i think if i were him i wouldn't
do
the things on this list again because i
know what happened
the last time i did them and that's why
you're not that's why you've never been
president i think
he does do those things poor daniel dale
this poor bastard the fact checker for
cnn
he's been basically putting his feet up
and you know coasting
collecting his paycheck during the biden
administration so far
a few weeks i mean he doesn't even get
on tv that guy
you know they don't even let him talk he
can write an article sometimes that's
about
it but man trump hits the scene and
suddenly he's like a whirling dervish
it's like wow
you know clear clear my schedule you
know give me
bring me the red bull you know we're
going in
we're going in hard and so daniel dale
goes into a fact-checking frenzy
and what's that do to the energy
suddenly everybody's energy is up
all right so now the fact-checkers are
fact-checking them
we don't want to talk about anything
else probably my traffic on
these uh on the on these live streams
will be way up
because he's in the news again you know
he gets a massive audience watching it
uh nobody else can do that nobody else
can even come close to that right now
how would you like to be the democrats
and realize that trump's popularity
right now
is the same as biden's
how would you like to know that taking
away
trump's twitter feed might not work the
work out the way you hoped this is
interesting to watch if you had said
what would be the impact of taking away
trump's twitter feed
in 2015 or 16 i would have said
devastating devastating or
even most of the way through his first
first term
i would have said pretty devastating if
you take away his twitter feed
but what happens if you take it away
after his first term when when he's
still
questioning the validity of an election
that no court has found any evidence
of widespread fraud i'd like to say that
so i can stay on social media
but you got that out there floating in
people's minds anyway
and trump comes in
and just starts stirring that pot again
and it
is so good what do you mean no courts
have heard any evidence
that's true but we're not allowed to say
that what country do you think you're in
don't no throw in all that useful
context
so i think the democrats
probably feeling a little bad so you
take away trump's
twitter and i have a feeling
that we might end up with something
closer to the
optimum amount of trump without without
anybody wanting that to happen
because there is a little bit of
too much right like he can't work you up
to the point of too much and so removing
his twitter
at this point completely different than
if had been removed earlier
but at this point it might help him
weirdly and the other thing that helps
him of course
is that the more uh biden struggles
the more the contrast will will start to
favor
trump and that's just not gonna stop it
just won't stop
we'll have four years of biden doing
either what trump did
because it worked or something that
biden changed
and isn't working out so well that's
what it's going to look like in four
years
now will will biden have some notable
successes
i'll bet yes i'll bet yes if i had to
bet on it i would think that there will
be some
genuine biden successes but
there's a lot of topics you know a few
successes might
not uh pay for the the rest of the
contrast
now of course trump also likes to use
his most provocative language
to guarantee that you see two movies on
one screen
how easy would it have been to not say
that mexico is not sending their best
it would have been really easy to not
say that sentence
and it would have been even easier not
to emphasize it and tell you to remember
it
[Laughter]
so he goes he goes for exactly
the the open wound he goes uh
there's still an open wound there from
when i announced in 2015
anybody still an open wound where is it
right right there on your arm right here
how does that feel hey hey ow how
how's this feel now
[Laughter]
and and what is the net effect of that
you can't frickin look away
you can't take your eyes off it it's
just not supposed to be happening
it's not supposed to be happening and
of course that is the the genius of
trump's
showmanship say what you will about
policies and whatnot
uh but just just on the
uh on the dimension of showmanship just
just nobody's even close
it's hilarious
so of course what trump means when he
says not sending their best
is he would be comparing that situation
to say india
which sends us so much of their
top technical talent that india is
worried about the people that are
leaving
you know in india is thinking hey maybe
you should stay here with your
high technical talent and and excellent
educations
so india would be an example of sending
us people who are
immediately you know starting
unicorn startups and crap like that and
it has nothing to do with anybody's
ethnicity
doesn't every country have have a best
it does it doesn't every single country
have a best and the worst
i mean you could see you can see it as
racial if you want
but you have to kind of want to see it
that way um
i heard some of the democrats saying
that trump was low energy
and i would say that that that feels
true in the sense if you're comparing
trump to trump
but if they're saying trump was low
energy compared to
let's say everybody else
there was no low energy because you
again you can't look away
um so trump basically made every other
republican look like furniture
every conversation that you might want
to have about who
else might run in 2024 as a
at least as a republican
it kind of doesn't matter anymore does
it because
pumps trump's current popularity
would make him a lock for the nomination
everybody else just disappeared
yesterday they just disappeared they
turned into furniture
and he did that with just showing up
all he did was show up and he turned the
entire republican field
of very capable people by the way right
you're
you're tom cotton's your your matt gates
et cetera you're talking about very
very qualified high operating
people and he just turned him into
furniture just by showing up
uh it's it's really amazing when you
look at it now i know i realize that i'm
uh for those of you who are anti-trump
it appears that i'm
uh going into fandom of
no objectivity whatsoever i'm not
talking about his policies
i'm not defending what happened with the
his
actions in the capital assault
it has nothing to do with that it's just
about the showmanship
and how that's important to the process
here
all right um here's
the best entertainment you're
you're gonna ever have uh if you're in a
certain category or person so this won't
work for everybody
but there's a youtube video of a
guy named potholder54 at least that's
his online name
p-o-t-h-o-l-e-r-54
if you're looking for him on youtube and
he's got a
he's got a longish piece there debunking
the debunkers
so you've seen a lot of coronavirus
debunkers ivor
cummins uh tony heller at one point
people who are claiming that sweden
teaches us something
that we did wrong in the other countries
and
watching watching a potholer debunk
the debunkers is such a
mind effort that you
really have to see it like you really
really it's
i could not recommend this more but at
the same time
i can't tell you from any you know
personal source i have
that the debunker of the debunker
is the one who's right which makes it
even more interesting
when you when you're done you still
won't know who's right
because this is number there's the first
thing you're going to learn today
whoever goes last in one of these
you know i'm debunking you and then i'm
debunking your debunking
whoever goes last is the most persuasive
that's why in a court case the defense
gets to go last
it's the only fair way you can do it
because if the prosecution won last
a whole lot of innocent people would get
prosecuted right
you need to let the defense go last to
feel that you've
you've even made the process modestly
fair
so don't assume that who went last is
the right one but here's
what's different about this if you
believed that the sweden example taught
you something
and then sweden got it right and the
united states got it wrong if
if if you were of that mind and i would
say
maybe at least half of you or more are
of that mind
what you'll find when you listen to this
is
uh you'll it will be like a mushroom
experience
like taking psychedelic mushrooms and by
the way i mean this
literally this is not an analogy
you'll get the same thing from this
as you would get from taking mushrooms
and what i mean by the same thing
is the experience of going into a
different reality for a while
you'll just experience a different
reality in which all the things you
thought
now this is only going to work if you
are sure that the sweden example told
you something
if you if you were pretty certain about
that then you'll have the experience of
entering a different reality
in which all of that stuff you stole
about sweden was ridiculous
now that doesn't mean that the other
reality is true right
because again it's just the one that
went last
maybe the maybe the people who got
debunked have some response to it
it's hard to imagine it's hard to
imagine they'd have any response to it
because when you see it
you're going to be pretty sure that's
the end of the conversation
but just keep in your mind whoever goes
last is always
the most persuasive and it has to do
with going last
so um i recommend this more than i've
recommended just about anything i've
ever recommended
even without knowing who's right because
when you see
these two clear realities
and you feel yourself the you feel
yourself moving to another one
even if it's temporary and then you
change your mind back later
that's the experience you get with
mushrooms and it changes you forever
because you start realizing for the
first time
how subjective your reality is and until
you realize that you're
trapped and your options in life are
smaller
as soon as you realize the the real
degree
to which your your reality is subjective
that's when you're free
that's when all your options open up
because if you look at
my life for example someone who
has had this experience of having my
options open up
a lot of stuff i've done didn't look
possible did it
just becoming a world famous cartoonist
how many people do that i mean i set out
to do that
now if i had not had that experience of
having
at least once spend time in an alternate
reality that was completely valid
i just was visiting and then i went back
to my other reality
if i'd never experienced that i would
also think that my first reality was the
limit
of what is possible but having
experienced
i'm going to call it the second reality
the first time in your life that you
experience a second reality
like really quickly where you go boop
bam new reality
if it happens like in just a period of
minutes
that's the point when everything changes
and until you've experienced your second
reality
you don't know there really is anything
else out there
but after you get the second one you
will also know
instantly there are more
lots more lots more
all right so i've never seen a piece of
content
or a situation because you need both the
content and the situation of what it is
you believed in the first place
i've never seen such a perfect
mushroom trip packed into a piece of
content
you really have to check it out and it's
trippy all right now and again it won't
work
if you were if you were already on that
page if you'd already sort of
seen that reality nothing will happen to
you it'll just be good
really good interesting content but you
won't have the mushroom trip
experience just some of you will all
right um
and you know what i'm not even gonna
oh yeah you know i should i should tease
you
no i'm not even gonna tell you i was
going to tell you what the video said
about sweden
but then it would kind of ruin it yeah
you got to do it yourself
i would just say that i had speculated a
lot
over the past year about why sweden
was being talked about and what was
different etc
and i don't think i got any of it right
as of as of this morning
i don't think i got any of it right
except that a lot of them live alone
that part
must be right okay see yourself
um there's a report that half of all
couples
are experiencing a worse sex life
because of the pandemic i guess being
forced to be together
in the house and i've got a question for
you
unless you have a pretty large house
which most people don't how do you have
sex in the house when there's kids in
the house
how do you do that like no seriously
like how do you do that because
i don't know if it's a biological reflex
of what but
if i even know that there's a kid
anywhere
like within potential listening distance
or
maybe might knock on the door or you
could hear him
hear him maybe with a tv on or something
how do you do it i'm looking at your
answers just because they're funny
people say lock the door but they're
still right there right they could be
right on the other side of the door
it and it's not so much that they can't
they can or cannot get in
i'm talking only about the mental part
where they're in your head
that's the part i'm talking about i'm
not talking about the physical
separation
i get that doors have locks i figured
that part out on my own
but you know they're there right how do
you get them out of your head
and if they're and if they're occupying
any part of your head how do you get
your head in that other mode
and let your your stories are hilarious
gotta be slick
lock the doors take mushrooms
life alert lock them in the basement
be quiet benadryl
[Laughter]
very quietly i think you tell them we're
wrestling
uh
it's it's a mental neutering somebody
says
put them in cages all right well i guess
we don't have any good answers for that
but that's out there so tom peters
management uh
expert i would say tom peters author and
expert he tweeted around an article with
a study that said that
men do most of the interrupting in
business meetings
so men do most of the interrupting
especially interrupting women
and then men do most of the talking
even if there are fewer men than women
the the men will dominate the talking in
business meetings
all right here's your next
lesson what is what what credibility
would you put on that
and how would you judge its credibility
all right the first thing you need to
know is that studies that are in this
category of let's say we
we studied what people do that's the
category
as opposed to studying physics or
studying a particle
that's a different category of science
but if you're looking at the category of
you know how do people act and you see
there's a study what
what automatic credibility would you put
on that
no higher than a coin flip no higher
than a coin flip
the best it can tell you is it might be
true
right the best it can do is alert you to
look for this
might be true maybe 50 right so that
doesn't mean that
this one has a 50 chance of being true
it just means that
stuff in this category has you know is
pretty sketchy
here's the next thing and i i offer this
tip as not 100
reliable but something you should keep
in mind
when does your uh your observation just
as a person who lives in the world
if your observation of things matches
what the science tells you that's a
pretty good indicator
science says it's true you observe it's
true
let's take some examples science says if
you spend too long in the sun without
sunscreen
you'll get a sunburn right
now if you do that your observation
matches that perfectly
so you don't really have any trouble
believing the science because
you can just sort of see it in the real
world it's yeah it's obvious
right how about smoking causes
lung cancer when you hear a story about
somebody who died of lung cancer what's
the first thing you ask were they
smokers
how often is the answer yes 95
of the time right so science says
smoking can give you lung cancer your
observation is
yeah it sure looks that way looks that
way to me
so those are cases of confirmation but
you know
the uh the human observation is not
reliable
but isn't it good when they they match
but here are some that didn't match
and never did all right when i was a kid
i thought it was science that you
shouldn't eat
uh within an hour of swimming or you get
a cramp
so that i thought that was the science
but
i never observed anybody getting a cramp
because they had recently eaten
and i knew lots of people who did it so
the observation didn't match what
somebody said was a science
it turned out it was not science
um likewise uh let's say using your cell
phone on an airplane
you know we all heard don't use your
cell phone and airplane the plane will
crash
but you know people have left their
phones on
you know they have you've probably done
it yourself haven't you left your phone
on for at least one flight
come on i'll bet you left your flight
how about you left your phone on at
least once
did your flight crash have you ever
heard of it no all of your observation
was opposite with whatever anybody
claimed was scientific
and then of course you learned later
okay there's a reason your observation
didn't match
right there's a reason it didn't match
there was no science to it
but let's take this claim that men do
most of the interrupting and most of the
talking
does that match your observation
go in the comments is your observation
and this is only for people who have you
know recently been in the workplace
if you've been retired for a while it
doesn't count we're talking about
modern times today true or not that men
are doing most of the interrupting
give me your observations i'm just going
to read them off
i see no no no no
no no no no no um if anybody's listening
to this
you should know that 85 of my audience
tends to be male
so we're not getting any kind of a
unbiased survey here
um i'm seeing some yeses
uh no no no somebody says my whole
family interrupts
uh no no no so there seems to be
i'd say a bias toward no
but it happens to be coincidentally
about in the same ratio as there are
men to women on this live stream
meaning that we might be seeing
something that's just sort of a gender
perception difference all right
um i would say it's
true to my observation i would say
and again this completely subjective and
the reason i asked you
is that i was not assuming that my
observation was some kind of a universal
truth
i was just assuming
that you might have different opinions
on this so
my observation is yes i would say men
men are more interrupted and try to
dominate
meetings i feel like that's true don't
you
but what is the reason see here's where
it gets dicey
it gets a little dicey here what's the
reason because it seems like there are a
few variables left out and here's your
next lesson always look for the
variables that are left out
because that's where the magic is if
you're if you're going to try to debunk
something on your own
that's the first place to look what are
they leaving out
i'll just give you some suggestions now
i don't
know that these were left out because i
didn't dig into it that deeply
but these are the questions you'd ask
right
so the first question i'd ask is
have they controlled for physical size
because don't you think that people will
interrupt
people who are physically smaller
whether they're male or female wouldn't
a big
creature male or female doesn't matter
who it is
wouldn't a larger person be more likely
to
interrupt a smaller person i don't know
but
if they didn't check that i'd say
that's something i'd check because i
would think that biologically
we're just give some deference to
anything that could kill us
right anything bigger than us you give a
little bit of deference to
how about um some of the things that
they may or may not
have checked um
how about do is there any difference in
um hierarchy in those meetings
so in other words was everybody the same
level and they
adjusted for that or were some of the
managers
because of other reasons that had
nothing to do with this specific meeting
but were there more men in management
and therefore
people deferred to them i don't know i
don't know
but that would be a factor um
how about how about uh
does everybody respond the same
in other words does everybody uh or does
everybody communicate the same
um if i were going to teach you
to communicate better would you say to
yourself hey
those flaws that you're talking about
they tend to be
in one gender versus the other we will
see how sexist you are
you ready to find out how much of a
misogynist or misandrist you are
well let me ask you some questions
in your comments i will find out what
sexist you are
if i told you that there was a person
and i will not tell you the gender
male or female and they do something i
call
looping which is they make their point
and then they just go back to the
beginning and make the same point again
with slightly different words and then
they
loop again and continue if i said
there's a person
who does that use your biased
sexist culturally biased
thinking to tell me who does that more
men or women
look at your answers there are a lot of
confident answers on
both sides right people saying neither
male
female male female
right now looping is not bad if what
you're doing
is trying to make sure that that's the
10 somebody remembers
because people forget 90 of what you say
so
you'll see me loop on this uh these live
streams
all the time but i do it intentionally
because there are some things that just
need to be reinforced
i just did it again right i just said
the same thing
at least twice in this format it
actually makes sense to do that fairly
frequently
radio radio hosts do it as well um
probably uh probably rush limbaugh
did a lot of it because he was filling
up you know hours a day
so certainly people do it that's not a
problem but if you're doing it in a
meeting
where everybody's trying to take a turn
it's really really bad
once people get it the first time so
personally i'm a big interrupter and i
will interrupt anybody who
loops don't be a looper
uh if you know one you know what i'm
talking about
here's another one do you talk without
leaving natural pauses
let me give you example of somebody who
talks with natural pauses
i'm doing it right now there's just
enough time
between each of my statements that if
somebody wanted to jump in
it wouldn't feel so much like
interrupting because they wouldn't have
to talk over me
i'm a good communicator so i leave just
enough time
that somebody can say oh can you clarify
and i don't feel like they talked over
me compare that to
somebody who does not leave natural
pauses they start talking and they'll
just go right into it
and when they loop they won't even tell
you that they ended one thought and
began another because one thought just
leads right
into another will i interrupt that
person
in a meeting every time
i will interrupt that person every time
because i don't want to hear that if you
can't leave me
a pause it doesn't have to be big
just a little bit of a pause so that i
can politely come in
just to find out you know maybe tests
that were still on the same topic
have you ever had somebody tell you
something you already knew
and you can't stop them here's the test
for this if somebody is calling you on a
cell phone
i think maybe cell phone to cell phone
is the worst
there there's a little bit of a thing
where if they're talking they can't
really hear you so well
i mean i think it's architected so
you're supposed to
but they can't do you have anybody in
your life that you've ever done this
with
i got it yeah i got it right yeah
i got it i got it no i got it please
please stop talking i've got it i've got
it i got it
please stop talking now what i'm doing
right now
is not an exaggeration i've done this
lots of times and the reason you can do
it just like i'm doing it
is that the other person can't hear you
they actually can't hear you
because they don't pause and as long as
they don't pause the cell phone has no
value
it's just a one-way it's a one-way
device
and so i have just for fun lots of times
just started yelling into the phone stop
it stop
talking i get it i get it
they can't even hear you now this isn't
everybody but people know they know who
they are
so don't be a looper don't be a no
pauser
and be direct and get to the point
i will tell you that in my entire life i
can't
think of a time i've ever been
interrupted in a business setting
i must have happened but i can't think
of any time
and i have to i have to think that that
wasn't
always because i was male because you
know if you're
23 and you're in a business meeting
it's not like you have any status the
the older
the older males are going to make sure
that you know what your status is
like by the way women if
if you're a woman and you know you've
experienced men being bullies and stuff
it's all true but they also do it to the
baton
right if if you're a young man with no
status
the older men are going to be pretty
harsh right
we expect that too so there's a little
bit of that
that said i do think that it's probably
true that men are more interrupters in
meetings
and um probably sexism is
part of that but there are a lot of
questions with this
study so
here's the
have you learned anything yet if the
only thing you got out of this live
stream
is how to know when you're being a bad
conversationalist
uh oh here's another tip how long do you
think you should talk
before making sure the other person gets
into the conversation
what's the longest let's say a
one-on-one conversation or worse
let's say it's a you know four people
out to dinner
how long should one of them talk before
letting somebody else in
i'm just looking at your answers
somebody says 30 seconds
2 minutes 5 minutes 30
uh 30 seconds 45 seconds
30 seconds three minutes 15 seconds two
minutes
all right everybody who said longer than
a minute
is a bore
[Laughter]
everybody who thinks that it would be
okay to talk for two minutes straight
you're boring you're boring
uh now have i ever talked for two
minutes straight oh yeah and you know
what happens when i do
i bore people i mean you could be the
most interesting person in the world
but two minutes is a long
long time for somebody to sit quietly
and listen
you know what what would be better
was a little little interactivity now
now if you're telling a long story
then you know maybe you need to have a
little more time
but even with a long story you can tell
it with pauses
the other person jumps in asks a
clarifying question
laughs at your joke or whatever but if
you've dominated a conversation for two
minutes
you might be boring that's way too long
so the people who said 30 seconds you're
probably about right
and if if you're one of the people who
said two minutes
i'm not i'm not trying to insult you
i'm trying to be useful if you didn't
know that
you just learned one of the most useful
things that you'll ever learn
because people will start liking you
more and you won't know why
oh i just kept my i just kept my chatter
down to
you know 30 seconds or so and made sure
other people got in
made sure i asked about you know their
situation and
showed a little interest in them
suddenly you've got all these friends
and people want to date you and marry
you and stuff
and it's the only change you're welcome
all right here's the coolest scariest
news
uh there's a company that makes a ai
program
called replica the instead of a
c at the end of replica it's uh the
letter k
replie k a replica
and what it does is it makes a little ai
thing you can chat with on through the
app or the internet i guess and what's
different about it
is that it learns to be you
what that's right it it
uh i guess it can scoop up your
conversations from before and
and it can build a little profile of who
you are from stuff that it can find on
the internet
or you provide to it but then beyond
that it asks you questions
and it's just a conversation list that
checks in with you
or you could check in with and they ask
questions about what you like and what
you've done i guess
until after you've answered enough of
them it can speak to you intelligently
just like a friend
now if this seems uh like
two different concepts that's sort of
what makes it
kind of compelling do you know how
people only love themselves
you know they we think we love other
people but we're
loving something that we love about
ourselves we're just finding it in
another person
in many cases so we care about ourselves
we love ourselves and then we
project that on onto the world so it's
kind of genius to make
an electronic digital friend
who is trying to be you because it's
mirroring you
it's pacing you there's nothing that you
should like more
than something that's just like you i
mean you choose your friends for their
similarities in many cases
so apparently this thing is uh
surprisingly good and some people who
have played with the early version
talk about how surprised they are
that they re they react to it like it's
a human connection
how many of you are surprised that the
people using this program
are having a human-like
you know just a whole interaction just
as compelling as a human
how many are you surprised by that
that this was always going to happen
and here's your
last little lesson for today
the reason anybody likes you is because
of the way you act
they can't see your inner thoughts
they can't and even if they think that
matters
they're way more influenced by what you
do
right your actions are who you are to
other people
now to yourself you're all these
thoughts and feelings and competing
emotions etc but you're not that to
other people to
other people you're kind of a robot
i see what the robot does and i have
feelings about it
but if you think that the machines will
not give us
as good a feeling as rich a feeling as
human to human interaction
you're dead wrong it's gonna be better
it's gonna be way better the the risk
is that it will be so much better that
you just won't want to interact with
people
and that's like a real risk well maybe
or maybe not maybe it's just a benefit
so you don't have to interact with
people
because loneliness is such a gigantic
problem
that if somebody solves loneliness
with an ai and when i say
if uh they already did it
it's called replica now i haven't used
it so i can't
can't recommend it or anything but in
terms of
you know will there be something like
this if it's not this one
that surpasses
human connection
a machine connection should surpass
human connection really quickly like
you're not going to wait 10 years for it
you're waiting more like months that's
months away if it's not already here
because what makes you like anybody what
makes you like a friend
the reason you like a friend is they
have things in common
the ai will make sure it has more in
common with you than any friend could
your friend is polite a.i will be more
polite than your friend
ai is let's say complimentary
your friends not so good in that
department but the ai could be great at
it
they they focus on positive things
ai beats again your friends they don't
focus on positive things
your your ai will never bring you a
problem
your friends do your ai is not gossiping
about you
your friends are your ai is not stealing
your
privacy okay it might do that
but if it's designed well i suppose it
wouldn't but your friends might
right so how hard is it going to be for
ai to be a better friend it's already
done
already done and you will respond to it
just
like a human but better because it won't
be annoying like a human
so that is your crazy thought for today
and somebody this this market for
the market for what i'll call a digital
uh friend
might be the biggest market
of any market it could be
because how much would you pay for a
friend
right think how much you pay for a car
you pay a lot for a car because the car
is like really really useful
how much would you pay for a friend if
you didn't have one
you pay more than you pay for a car so
the
the market for ai friends
it might be the biggest market that's
ever been created
it might be bigger than the energy
market all right
that's all for now i will talk to you
tomorrow
all right i just turned off periscope
you youtubers yeah i thought uh wasn't
periscope
supposed to go away i think maybe it
wasn't today
how much would you pay for a sex spot
people will
prefer uh digital
digital sex spots over with people that
will happen
certainly within five years yeah within
five years some subset of the population
and maybe that's already here i think
there are probably some people who are
who are already saying
you know a really good sex but is better
than a defective person
but there are very few people in that
category today in five years
i'll bet that'll be 10 about 10 of the
public
will be preferring some kind of a
digital
sexual relationship five years all right
that's all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
