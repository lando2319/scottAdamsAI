okay everybody if you haven't heard
there's an end to the mask mandate in
california on february 1st
february 1st you do not need a mask
anywhere in california instead
just bring this picture with you you can
find it on twitter it's the governor
maskless in a place that requires masks
just yesterday so the next time somebody
asks you for a mask remind them that on
february 1st the government of our state
california lost its privilege of
leadership
and that is being replaced by the will
of the people
and from now on this is all you need to
show and then the establishment that
requires masks
good luck
