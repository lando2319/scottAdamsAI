pumpkin
good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams the finest thing
that ever happened to you and if you'd
like to take this experience up all you
need is a cup of micro glass of tanker
Chelsea Steiner canteen sugar flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now from the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine again of the
day the thing makes everything better
it's called
simultaneousip and it happens now
ah well I love you too
thank you for that
good stuff ah
well in the most important news of the
day
uh
Russian President Putin
has
signed a decree to honor the American
actor Steven Seagal
and he won the important state order of
friendship
so I guess the goal has been a regular
visitor to Russia
even has citizenship he's got a passport
he's uh he's a special representative to
the United States and Japan
pretty good job
so I think Steven Seagal will probably
be sent to the front lines
I believe he'll be fighting with the
Wagner group
and if you see Steven Seagal running
toward you
you better run
have I ever done an impression of Steven
Seagal running in one of his movies
goes a little like this
I don't know why
if you've ever seen his movies
here's what you call a an inelegant
Runner
you know some people run really much I
was like
yeah but uh you need some running
lessons from
somebody all right
well that wasn't much of a story have
you noticed that it's a sort of a slow
news time
is anybody noticing that like there's
something big coming or something
it's like the news just sort of stopped
so maybe making me wonder if the news
organizations
are just operating on a budget now
because if you notice that the news is a
lot of
well there was a thing that everybody
knows happened
let us give you some opinions on it
like the actual news news part seems to
have completely disappeared and that was
just commenting on personalities and and
you know Mysteries that we don't
understand
so uh Marco Rubio did a tweet on the
so-called uaps these unidentified
advanced
whatever UFOs let's call them UFOs
and Politico has a story about it now
keep in mind that Marco Rubio I believe
he has access to the the secrets right
like the country's secrets
is that right
confirm that Marco Rubio would have more
access
because he's on whatever committees yeah
so he knows what what the military
secrets are and he tweeted the story
from I think it was political
and Politico was saying uh and I have to
admit
I have to admit today is the first day
that I said to myself
there might be some unidentified
Advanced objects up there
I have to admit I never took it
seriously
but listening to this one report from
One Pilot apparently there's tons of
corroboration
that Pilots have been seeing things for
years
yeah they've had near a bunch of near
collisions
and
they all see them and apparently is
something that all the pilots talk about
and they all know what's up there and it
seems to whatever they are do not seem
to respond
to normal physics
now here here are the things if you're
trying to analyze this story and ask
yourself if it's real
here are the things you would want to
ask yourself number one
why is nobody ever gotten a good picture
of one
no good picture
just fuzzy pictures
well I'm not sure they have a good
picture
I mean there's just like a Tic Tac right
um secondly
one of the things that caught my
interest was they were not detecting
these until
they upgraded their radar
what's that tell you
they weren't detecting them until they
upgraded their radar
well apparently they suspected my better
radar problem you know maybe there was
some kind of
you know junk in the radar and but they
ruled that out because I can also detect
them on infrared and they also have
visual
so they have visual plus infrared
do you think that's enough
or is it just three points of
confirmation bias
because suppose suppose the radar is off
and they'd never really looked at the I
don't know maybe the infrared is picking
up birds or some damn thing and maybe
maybe what the pilot see is not exactly
what's up there
so you have at least three possibilities
that you know people are just seeing
things that aren't there
I I would think it would be nearly
impossible
for all of this alleged activity to be
happening
without
without us knowing for sure
if it's true if if they're really up
there and it's like all the time is
really common it's been happening for
years or decades and we've got all this
you know uh all this information about
them and we can't confirm it
that feels a little weird do you know
what it sounds like
uh when I was a kid
there are all these Ghost Hunters
and you know he's here oh yeah a lot of
us saw that ghost and then we use our
ghost spotting machine and sure enough
it detected a ghost
so now we've got eyewitnesses Plus or
machine detected it you know you can
talk yourself into ghosts
you can talk yourself into Bigfoot
and Nessie
so it's entirely possible that we're
talking ourselves into UFOs
but I have to admit today's the first
time when I you know read the body of
evidence that I thought maybe
but then did we really go through this
whole UF this whole uh Chinese balloon
thing
and they were all just balloons like is
it possible that every time you shoot
one down it turns out to be a balloon
the weather balloon
makes you wonder makes you wonder
um I would bet I would still bet against
them being uh Advanced alien crafts
what do you think what should place your
bets I say they are not Advanced alien
crafts I don't know what they are but
anybody disagree
the you know the thing that's
interesting is that Marco Rubio thinks
there's something to worry about up
there
now I would agree with worrying worrying
makes sense you know we should keep an
eye on whatever the hell is going on but
well the Chinese drones that wouldn't
explain it would explain everything
except the
uh not corresponding to physics
and I think that now corresponding to
physics
part could be
false as well you know maybe it's just
the way you see it
all right
um
with Fox news reporting that there's I
guess Tucker had to discussed a Chinese
virologist who was one of the ones who
sounded the alarm in 2020 about where
the coronavirus came from
now is it your belief that the U.S
government has confirmed that the virus
came from the Wuhan lab
is that is that what the news told you
did the news say the U.S government has
confirmed
no it didn't apparently there are a
number of agencies within the government
and they have low levels of confidence
that it came from that lab but it's not
even it's not even a government
consensus
so on the right people are treating it
like it's a confirmed fact
but the government has not confirmed it
it's just it's just moving heavily in
that direction so if you if you act like
it's confirmed you're probably going to
be right
probably but not confirmed
um
however
the added part to the story on Tucker's
show was that Dr Lee mang Yang told them
that the said that the Chinese
government intentionally manufactured
and released
uh the virus to Nation
yeah
do you believe that do you believe that
it was intentionally created
and that it was intentionally released
that NPC
yeah so the part I don't uh
don't worry Donald's angry uh the part
that
I'm getting distracted by comments here
the part that doesn't make sense to me
is I can't imagine China believing it
would help them
that I can't get past that
there would have to be a strategy
for why that would be a good idea
now nobody's saying that the virus
affects
non-chinese people more than Chinese
people right which at one point there
was some question whether that was the
case because the infections were so low
in China
but that was probably because of the
lockdown
um to hurt Trump
no see the trouble is that China would
have to know
that they would be hurting themselves at
the same time
there's no there's no feasible way that
they thought
releasing a pandemic was going to work
in their favor
I I just don't see any reasoning that
that makes sense
you think the Democrats were behind it
that's even that's even more
conspiratorial
so I don't doubt that it was
manufactured and I don't doubt that it
came from the Wuhan lab we don't know
for sure but I do doubt that China would
do it as an intentional strategy
now it could be that it escaped
accidentally but then they kept the
kept the doors open so everybody was
equally infected or something I don't
know possible I suppose but it just
doesn't seem like a good strategy
so I doubt it
all right
um
there's also some reporting of course on
CNN because they like to dunk on
Fox News so they're reporting all the 10
things that we found because of the
Dominion lawsuit which gave Dominion
access and now we've seen them in court
the court filings
and
we saw a bunch of emails like from
Murdoch
Etc and CNN's reporting that there are
10 things
10 things that we're learning that are
embarrassing to Fox News I read most of
them and none of them really none of
them looked embarrassing so here's what
they think is outrageous
that Murdoch wants to give his customers
what they're asking for which was at the
time more commentary about the election
integrity
is that wrong
the customers the audience that Fox News
has wanted that content
and Tucker and Hannity
accommodated and gave them that content
now the the and here's where CNN comes
up with some fake news
you have to have fake news in order to
sell this narrative right so CNN comes
up with the fake news that quote
uh these documents reveal that Fox News
Executives and hosts knew the truth
about the election and yet they peddled
election lies to the audience
so that was their summary
that the Fox News Executives knew and
yet they peddled the election lies to
the audience
how in the world could anybody have
known that
CNN is reporting that somebody knew
actually knew the unknowable
and and they do that with like a
straight face you know uh figuratively
speaking how could you say that with a
straight face
now I completely I completely understand
if they said something like the election
was officially called or there's no
evidence there's no evidence of fraud
that's reliable well there was plenty of
evidence but it turned out the evidence
was not reliable
so
this is just outrageous
when you see the Press just create like
a whole lie about their competitor
and and the other quotes from Murdoch
were is not a red or green issue it's a
green meaning it's about money
at what point are you surprised that Fox
News is running stories that that his
audience likes because they think
they'll make more money that way
at what point are we supposed to be
surprised by that
I I you know it would be one thing
if nobody understood that Fox News leans
right
and the others lean left I mean once you
understand which way they lean you know
I think the worst the worst accusation
is one that's basically the same that
CNM got caught with the worst one is
that Murdoch let Jared Kushner
see the campaign ads of Trump's
competitor
to prepare for them I guess
and and I thought to myself well that
does sound pretty bad that does sound
more like you know directly influencing
things more than just being the news
but isn't that exactly yeah that's what
down in Brazil did when she gave the uh
the debate questions to was it to
Hillary is that what happened
um and you know nobody got fired for
that
nobody got fired for that so that's that
stuff sort of in the noise once you
understand that they're both in the bag
for a team
the fact that they're talking to the
team and working with them it's not like
a big surprise or anything so I think
that's why it's not making much of a
dent it wouldn't surprise anybody
asked this question on Twitter at a
Twitter poll
I said is the press a hate group
uh 58 well here are the choices I give
them a choice of yes no or uh Fu Scott
I figured that would be popular this
week 58 yes the Press is a hate group 10
said no and 32 percent said uh Fu Scott
now
what I asked is the press a hate group
let me ask you this
how many people immediately understood
that that had to be hyperbole
did did anybody get fooled by it
were you all sure that that was
hyperbole
because an adult would know that there's
no such thing as the press that where
they all act the same
there's no such thing as the Press like
one entity of all similarity nobody
believes that so everybody would have
known that is the press a group would be
clear hyperbole
and that's good nobody complained
nobody complained
so it's good when people understand
hyperbole in some situations but
sometimes maybe they don't
sometimes maybe they don't
well I'd like to thank again I don't I
can't remember if I did this
on live stream but black black
conservatives have been great to me this
week so
most of the black I think most or all of
the black conservatives who have looked
at my controversy this week and looked
into it the ones who looked into it
yeah we are private the ones who looked
into it uh said oh that's no big deal
it's kind of alarming maybe it wasn't so
good to use those words but no real
problem here
now how do you process
that
if you're the mainstream media so as you
know
uh as you know I'm fully canceled all my
books and comics and calendars
everything fully canceled
how do you process the fact that black
conservatives don't have a problem with
what I said
because if black conservatives don't
have a problem with it
does that tell you it's about black
people or does it tell you it's about
how we're framing our politics
what does that tell you
if if black conservatives and black
liberals all said oh that's I see that's
some racism there that I'd say that's
probably racism
because the correlation is really clean
okay all black people of all types look
at it they're they're all offended it's
all the same
but what happens when one political side
says it's not it's not any kind of
racism anybody's worried about and the
other side says it's the worst racism
we've ever seen
does that tell you that your opinions
have been assigned by the media
it does that that's a very clear signal
that it's not about race but the entire
Media made it about race
I mean it's about race obviously that's
the topic but if people who are American
and black are looking at it and saying
ah I don't see what you're complaining
about doesn't look like a canceling
situation to me
then you can rule out the fact that it's
just about black and white
could it be
that the race industrial complex is once
again finding a way to monetize
race
is there somebody monetizing race
because that would be the most evil
thing I could possibly think of would
wouldn't you think
imagine if you knew there was some
entire industry
who had figured out a way to monetize
racial division
now that would be evil
that would be evil and what if the same
group that was monetizing racial
division
had the power
to frame any individual that they were
talking about in the worst possible way
well that would be pretty bad
that would be pretty bad so your worst
possible situation is that the media the
Democrats and maybe some other
organizations are monetizing
creating racial unrest
I'm just putting that out there is there
anybody who doubts
that there is something that could be
called and by the way I'm stealing this
from a Twitter user rabbit hole so
credit to Rabbit Hole for this one but
it's very clear when you see it drawn
out that there is a a race baiting
industrial complex sort of a corporate
entity and you know related entities and
so they when when they see a story that
they can especially take out of context
like my case it's easy to take out of
context and by the way
today is is now stretched into
anti-Semitic
just just process that for a moment
that let's see Jeffrey greenblood yeah
Jonathan greenblatt
um he said Adam's remarks about the
black community are flat out racist and
should be condemned by all period now
I'm not sure if he's aware of that black
conservatives did not condemn it
I wonder what he thinks about that
so yes
and he says I I believe in counsel not
not Council but Council culture so I I
hope talking about me I hope he'll
apologize
and
apologize and work to educate himself
so Jonathan greenblatt of the ADL
uh says that I should be
apologizing
now he didn't ask you didn't specify
what the apology was for
which you understand is the problem
right
if he knew what I had to apologize for
he wouldn't ask me for it
because I'll explain that later if he
had any idea what I said it's obviously
he didn't know what I said but in
context he probably knew what I said but
not in context
um he wouldn't ask me to explain it more
because have you noticed that the media
has completely eliminated
my uh
my explanation
that the reason that things are tense
racially is that the public is being
sold a Non-Stop Narrative of white
people being enemies and the cause of
all discrimination and white supremacy
and all that stuff
uh now have you seen anybody in the news
yeah most of you have seen lots of
coverage have you seen anybody in the
news
who accurately said oh Adams is talking
about ESG and Dei and CRT
and how those are going to have a an
obvious impact
on racial Harmony
and it's already having a terrible
impact has have you seen it yeah now
just just imagine this I'm I'm double
trending on Twitter today
Dilbert is traveling and and my name is
trending
I'm two of the five trending things on
Twitter
and zero zero members of the media have
reported what I said in context
none
zero zero members of the media
have reported what I said in his proper
context
not one
Am I Wrong you've all been watching the
coverage
how many said that they connected it to
the the racial training that's happening
in the public
and what the obvious impact of that
would be
uh-huh
now the reason that they can't report
that is you tell me what's the reason
that they can't report my actual context
too complex that's part of it it's not
simple
because it would implicate that
it would implicate them as the problem
right the media is the problem
how much trouble do you think
or how much you know trouble would there
be if they simply had not reported on me
suppose I had just said what I said on
social media and that was it and the
media never picked it up
it wouldn't even be anything
because the people who saw it were like
yeah
it actually didn't make much of an
impact
the actual original comments made almost
no impact because people you know were
more likely to know me as a live
streamer and you know have a better idea
what I'm up to
it was the media that made this a
problem
now of course they'll say but Scott
you're the one who said it
and this would be a good time to do my
impression
of an NPC
now you've seen some of this but I'm I'm
compiling my list of NPC things now an
NPC is a non-player character in a video
game
and uh since we live in a simulation
there are lots of them
and here are the things you want to do
if you're an NPC and you want to
contribute to this conversation but you
have no ability to add anything useful
oh somebody's saying that green blood is
calling me a holocaust denier
just think about that
a holocaust denier because I said it
would be hard to count count the number
of dead
does that sound like a holocaust denier
it's hard to get an exact count of of a
horrible situation in world two world
two
so that's all it costs there okay
so you can see that the cancellation is
going deeper do you know why the
cancellation has to look for new stuff
because the stuff they found wasn't real
and they're at this point people are
realizing that the initial claim isn't
real
that I didn't actually say something as
offensive as they think
and once they realize that they're going
to have to keep with the narrative so
they have to find some new stuff to add
to the laundry list
I I think Holocaust denier might be that
what do you call it Jumping the Shark
point
all the custom higher
all right so here are the things the
NPCs will say
and I'd like to do this in the NPC voice
Scott the real problem here that you
don't seem to understand is that you're
a horrible narcissist and nobody likes
you
see quite a bit of that it makes you
wonder what would be the point of that
tweet
you know I'd like to go on Twitter and
I'd like to be useful
I'd like to say something insightful
I think I'll just
insult this guy and PC then of course
there's the NPC the first amendment is
not the same as corporations making
monetary decisions why don't you
understand Scott why don't you
understand that the First Amendment only
protects free speech from the government
not from corporations they can do what
they want
well NPCs
NPCs the
thank you for pointing that out that's
the first time I've ever heard it
and also if you're an NPC you should
always point out this swimming is one of
the best forms of exercise
you can just insert that in any exercise
conversation and people will say well
wow didn't know that
the the other one that used to be
sensible
but is now stupid
is this one
you said those exact words
whenever you hear that you said those
exact words
that person is always wrong
and that's that's a tell for realizing
they don't know the context
and it's also a tell for understanding
that they don't know that almost
everything in the news is taken out of
context so lots of times it's what
people said it's just out of context
so the dumbest thing you could say you'd
have to be an NPC to say that is you
said those exact words Scott don't deny
it those are your words the exact words
did you say these words let me quote
them and put them in a tweet did you say
these words are these the words that
came out of your mouth did you say yes
yes
okay anybody who believes that the exact
words will tell them something useful
is not living in the present there might
have been a time when it was possible
but in 2023 every time you hear those
were his exact words or hers you know
that it's Oaks
it's something in a context
and here's the other one that's funny
Scott
apparently you didn't understand there
are consequences to actions
what
what is there somebody who doesn't
understand there are consequences to
actions anyway so if you want to be an
NPC that's your material go with that
all right so uh Jonathan Greenblatt now
remember there are some people who are
you know uh
race and ethnic rifters
grifter being somebody who makes their
money by
bringing up race stuff
Jonathan Greenblatt I believe could you
give me a fact check on this doesn't he
get paid to complain about stuff like
this
if you get paid to look for injustice
how much are you going to find
it's like somebody who's a ghost hunter
all right I'm gonna pay you to find
ghosts how many did you find
well are you paying me by the ghost yes
I am
I found quite a few
found quite a few ghosts
so uh Jonathan Greenblatt who gets paid
to find ghosts he found some ghosts
good job
and he would like to have me apologize
for what I don't know
and then he would have me re-educated
do you believe that I need to be
re-educated
and what exactly would they tell me
what would the re-education say you
should move closer to people who don't
like you
is that is that what the education would
be it's a good strategy in life if you
know there's a demographic group that
has been poisoned by the media
to be primed not to like you should you
move close to them well I think I think
the re-education would say that I should
so I'd like to I'd like to know more
about the at re-education
if somebody can find that out would it
be teaching me that you should spend
more time with the people who've been
primed to dislike you and I think you're
the problem
huh
Hartwick doesn't count as an education
you might be right about that
all right
um
this brings us to what I'll call the Dr
Drew hypothesis about this situation
I guess he said on a podcast yesterday
quote was what God is up to I don't know
but he's always up to something
does that sound like me
he's a hypnotist okay fair enough and
he's a persuasion expert and he's been
playing with the idea of how to create
hoaxes so he's up to something here
huh
interesting hypothesis David box and
weren't added to that and he said
my take is that Scott Adams is locating
himself at the fulcrum of power
from now on any conversation about
racing that U.S will have to include him
huh
what do you think of that
have I have I located myself at the
fulcrum of power and from now on any
conversation about race in the U.S will
have to include me
well it does look like that doesn't it
looks like that
so I asked on Twitter what is the first
rule of persuasion
what's the first rule of persuasion
getting attention right attention is
persuasion I think my service says this
directly and but persuaders know this
right attention is number one that's
what Trump did so well Trump sucked all
the energy from the other candidates got
all the attention yeah so attention is
the first rule of persuasion
um
if you were going to have a conversation
today about ASG and CRT and its effect
on society who would be something you
who would be somebody you'd want to talk
to
like who would be somebody who'd really
gets you some clicks if you're talking
about
the way the public is being educated on
you know Dei and ESG and CRT who would
be a person
who just naturally just jump out as a
provocative voice
that would have something to say
interesting
and
let me ask you this
do you think that the poisoning of
racial relations
that's coming through CRT and the SG and
Dei do you think that's one of the
biggest problems in the country
or is that a small small problem or a
big problem
is it more important than let's say
let's say as a existential risk to the
United States
is the way that the youth are being
educated
specifically the CRT e s gedi stuff is
that
um
is that something that could be fixed
is it fixable in the theory like it'd be
really really hard but
is it fixable I would think so
I would think so
um
let me tell you something that's in my
uh canceled book
uh so
yeah
um
well let me get to that moment first
first of all uh here's my take on all on
CRT ESG and Dei
now this is the same take that I took in
the Dilbert comic before it got canceled
it's still going to be on the locals
platform but
um
these are good ideas
well-meaning ideas
that eventually go wrong and why do they
go wrong what is the mechanism so let's
say you know CRT and the SD and Dei
they'll have high level goals which in
themselves sound good yeah what happens
is the the grifting class gets in there
and then and then everybody has to
signal
to the grifting class
so the the grifter is the one who's
making money on introducing stuff you
know they'll start to embarrass the
people who don't do it and you know then
everybody needs to signal that they're
on board and then if you're not on board
you look like a racist so you see the
mechanism is very clear somebody has a
good idea with lofty goals and then it's
completely mismanaged by you know the
grifters and the money makers and the
packagers and the you know the
politicians and the managers and then
the people who are not directly in the
money flow
are scared to death to say it's bad
because it's been you know introduced as
the the an excellent thing
so the most Dilbert thing that I could
ever teach you
is that the fact that they're great
ideas is almost a guarantee that they're
going to destroy something
because the great idea is what attracts
all the energy hey that's a great idea
then all the grifters come in they turn
it into the opposite of what you wanted
and then then everything falls apart
all right here's here's a a big big
theme
I believe that everybody has an
operating system
meaning that there's there's a go-to
kind of default the way you see the
world
and there's some of these operating
systems are really good
and some of them are really unproductive
thank you
it's very nice of you
um and here's here's the worst operating
system
I'm a victim
right a million people have said this
but I'm going to add to it so it won't
be so boring in a moment right the worst
the worst operating system is that
you're a victim now I suppose you
actually are
suppose you actually can totally draw a
line from what other people did
the bad things that happen to you should
you them because it would be accurate
it's accurate would you should a victim
mentality be the one you would adopt
it can help you a little
complaining definitely helps
complaining always helps right but it
only helps you up to a point
and then it it destroys everything
now let me give you a model
that is better than the this better than
CRT better than ESG
better than Dei
because they're all victim they're sort
of even though they don't maybe present
it that way they are a victim
Vibe wouldn't you say
why why are you telling me to move on
stop saying that
right it's just the worst thing you can
say in a live stream it's just the worst
thing you could do just just don't do
that anymore okay
so here's the better operating system
the the way you should go through life a
reciprocity operating system
reciprocity
in which you see your value being only a
reflection of what you've added to the
system or the situation
reciprocity
can get you everything
victim stuff can give you some stuff in
the short term
right in the short term Nikki case in
the long term the only thing that works
for anybody is reciprocity
right it's the reason you want to do
business with somebody
because they'll do something for you
reciprocity
the uh
the the part that you don't see of my
current drama in the news is how many
people have contacted me privately
especially black black Americans and
saying some version of uh thank you for
helping me personally
and I didn't realize how many black
Americans I'd personally helped but
they're contacting me and saying you
know I know the I know the charges are
untrue you know obviously you're not a
racist
so that's sort of been happening behind
the scenes people don't see that now
that's that's the rest reciprocity
operating system right I did something
for some people
apparently a number of things over the
years didn't really remember them
but that little bit of that little bit
of giving without asking caused these
same people to surface years later you
know sometimes years later to say I got
your back
that's reciprocity they got my back
in fact everything good that I think
that's ever happened to me is because
one or more people I was with got into a
reciprocity mindset
the people I've worked with in in lots
of contexts now here's what I would say
would fix race relations
a reciprocity mindset
that's it
Black America has to give us something
you didn't see that coming did you
that's right
there there is a huge impulse
in White America to help Black America
I know because I've done a lot of stuff
in that zone now a lot of people were
just tuning in to be for the first time
you don't know that I tried working with
black lives matter you don't know that I
supported Colin Kaepernick you don't
know that I supported
um
uh was a prison reform
you don't know that I wrote in favor of
reparations a different form of it not
not the one you're seeing
you don't know uh but basically you
don't know that I've been working for
years and years to try to figure out how
to improve the Black American situation
now for those of you who are new and
don't know anything about me could those
of you who have watched me for a while
just confirm that
because you know I do it in public so
you would know
right so and I know and by the way I
should say that I did all of that all
the things I mentioned
were in the context of my primary
audience not liking it
do you know that as well right that it
cost me a tremendous amount of money
to do something my audience said was a
waste of time
because my audience was saying you're
not going to help it's not going to help
don't do it because there's no
reciprocity
or or the the grifters will get in the
way or the government will screw it up
or something there's always something
right
so at Great personal expense for the
last several years I could have made a
killing just pretending to agree with
everybody
do you know how much money I could made
live streaming from the Trump era on if
all I did was agree with the Republicans
like Murdoch does right the the story I
told you before Murdoch says our
customers want this so we'll do this
I say
what you want is not necessarily what's
good for you
right you've seen me do it over and over
again I tell you you might not like this
but it's good for you you should you
should hear the other argument all the
time
so here's what my problem was
having worked quite a bit and that great
personal expense and risk
um I was doing things that
realize have no reciprocity element to
them
now I wasn't doing it to get something
back
like that wasn't the idea like I would
have felt good if I'd you know made a
difference Etc that would have felt good
but
I wasn't doing it this somebody would do
something back for me
but here's what I'm going to ask for
I'm going to ask for an ask it's very
direct this is an ask for black
Americans
right I'm going to ask for something in
return
because a lot of us are very pro-black
America and want it to work
and I think it's where you can get the
most leverage that's always been my
argument if you help Black America this
is actually a black lives matter Hawk
Newsom thing that I got from him got
from Hawk then if you help black
Americans you end up helping everybody
because it'd be hard to fix education
for black Americans without it sort of
accidentally fix a gift for everybody
right so so it's like this great lever
uh I'm gonna add I'm going to add to the
NPC list I'm seeing an NPC comment keep
digging
so that the NPCs on YouTube keep saying
keep digging
now that's got to be an NPC right
it's like completely unrelated to what's
happening right now
so here here's the ask
I'm asking black Americans to understand
that white Americans feel very very
uncomfortable and worried worried that
the narrative is demonizing them
and that that has a really big negative
impact and if you don't see it coming
that will be bad for you and I don't
want that
I don't want tensions to grow to the
point where like I don't guess out of
hand
so
I need black Americans to understand
that their actions have an impact on
other people
and if they reorient themselves in a
reciprocity model
they can have almost everything they
want it just won't happen right away
here's what reciprocity would look like
Black America saying you know what I've
had a tough time with all you
Republicans
but we seem to agree on school choice
so how about this
we we black Americans will give you
Republicans a little bit of the benefit
of a doubt
you know sort of will give you something
we'll we'll work with you may even make
you make your politicians look like
they're doing a better job but what we
want in return reciprocity
is a real fix for Education like a real
deep fix
reciprocity now you tell me that
wouldn't make the world better not only
for school not only for fixing the
biggest part of systemic racism which is
the inequality in the education system
but tell me that wouldn't make everybody
feel better about everybody else
oh wow
you just treated me with respect and we
worked on this thing together and then
we got a thing together
does that ever go wrong
well I suppose it could
you know I'm I'm not in favor of the
overtly racist comments I'm seeing in
the uh in in the in the comments
um so
don't appreciate those
and the less you do
the less you do that the better
all right
so what else
uh there's new Rasmussen poll
uh I think you'll see it maybe in a few
hours but I got a sneak peek and uh
here's here's my it's talking about race
relations
so the the new rascus in poll is looking
at people's opinions of race relations
now the last poll was just leave from
Rasmussen was justly criticized because
there were only 130 black Americans who
were asked the question
uh it was a bigger poll it's like a
thousand people were asked but only only
130 of them were were black
now it turns out that the what would you
guess would be the margin of error
for a poll that was only 130 people if
the 130 were correctly picked you know
to be randomized
Etc
it's around eight percent
about eight percent
so so people said wait that 130 is way
too few people
it is if you if you need to be within
two percent it's way too few people
but it's sort of an eight percent margin
of error which means if you know if it
said fifty percent something it might
have been 42. I don't know if it really
changes anything but I don't I don't
trust that poll because it was uh the
form of the question
but the new one uh
is asking the question about race
relations but I'd like to make this
differential
in my opinion and this is just
entirely anecdotal let's see if you
agree with this agree or disagree
they're race relations on an individual
level
are better than ever
meaning two people standing in a room
better than ever
right yeah everybody say yes on the
locals what do you say on YouTube
individually one-on-one better than ever
oh everybody on YouTube saying no not
everybody but way more knows
how interesting I thought most of you
would agree with that because as far as
I know interracial marriage is up
you know
contact is up
and I never feel anything
like any kind of racial thing when I'm
talking to somebody individually
like you don't feel any racial anything
you're just talking to somebody
but
that's different from what we think
about like race right so individually I
think it's all better who you hire who
you date who you hang around with all
better way better
but our feelings our feelings about the
the other group as a group not as
individuals but as a group I believe are
not good and so here's what uh um
Rasmussen said
uh 41 say race relations are getting
worse
41 percent
um and interestingly yeah I'll give you
more black more breakdown
um only well let me see if you could
guess the next number
um
how what percentage of American adults
do you do you think said that race
relations in the nation today are good
or excellent
how many how many people would have said
the race relations are good or excellent
you're very close 24 24 percent
I don't know how you do it your guessing
is amazing
yes 24 percent
uh but that isn't much change since uh
January of 20 one year ago
um
let's see 41 now say race relations in
America are getting worse uh but it's oh
that's down
well okay uh only 18 now say race
relations in America are getting better
so only 18 say it's getting better and
over 40 percent say it's getting worse
um
how many people this will be another one
here's another tough question
people were also asked
um
is the way racial issues are treated by
schools and universities so that gets
you to the CRT you know stuff is the way
racial issues are treated by schools and
universities helping to decrease racism
how many believe that the way the
schools and universities are treating
things decreases racism take a guess
what percentage
oh you're so good you're so close yeah
you're you're very close 23 percent
they they think that uh the esge stuff
and CRT like stuff is helping all right
say
and 44 say schools are making racism
worse
uh and 20 say not much impact
all right so
if we didn't believe the Rasmussen poll
about what black people think about
white people
do you believe the Rasmussen poll
that a whole bunch of people think race
relations are bad and that the way
people are being educated is making it
worse
do you think those conclusions would
hold by the way a national poll is only
a thousand people did you know that
a national poll is only a thousand
people but statistically that's all you
need that's actually plenty there are
lessibles that are way less than a
thousand and and they're still
statistically useful but a thousand is
completely useful so this is you know
even if you give or take three or four
percent on these numbers
does this support what I just said
that the way the public is being
educated
is making the public
um more uncomfortable about race not
less
what would you say is the case made
yeah the case is made if you know
because I don't I don't think there's
I don't think there's enough room for
error in these questions or this size of
a poll
that it would change a conclusion like
it might you know might be off of a few
percent but it wouldn't change the
conclusion
that things are bad
people think they're getting worse more
people than think it's getting better
and that they they can track it to the
way they're being
primed
now I would add to that
you know the the impact of the media the
impact of all the cancellers look at how
much dopamine was produced by canceling
me
think about this for a moment how do you
train a dog
you can retreat
then it works every time and it works
for basically any animal that can be
trained
a trait
now when people uh
when something gets canceled like me and
everybody gets to send their Mean Tweets
do you think they get a dopamine hit
when they they feel they've they've
dunked on me of course they do yeah it's
a whole dopamine cycle
so I'm basically caught up in a dopamine
cycle that's aided by an economic model
that wants to boost every claim of you
know impropriety
and
here we are
so if if you wanted to look at this and
say this is about what Scott said it
totally is
it totally is you know and and I am the
the primary trigger for everything that
happened and of course you know I knew
there would be some uh let's say
consequences that was obvious
um
but wouldn't you say that the only
reason we're here like the situation is
because it's monetized and people are
getting a dopamine kit from it it's not
about what's good or bad for black
Americans
yeah once again Black America is ignored
in favor of Chasing Ghosts
right oh we'll just go chase this ghost
this is cheap this this will get us a
lot of clicks
so we're the chasing ghost phase
all right
um
so ladies and gentlemen
what do you think
have I put myself at the fulcrum of
power on one of the most important
questions in the United States and the
only person who can explain it in a
useful way
or have I thrown away my career and my
reputation for nothing
to be determined
well this movie is is not over
there there are some more twists and
turns
coming
I know some of them you don't but stay
tuned for that
but we probably do need to uh
we probably do need to uh
figure out some smarter way to to be
but bumpy is not well informed sorry
bumpy so the so the opinions of me have
formed into two movies and the two
movies are roughly this
people who understand the context and
have no problem with me
and people who only saw the news
coverage with you know some some
statements I made that were provocative
and they have a whole different view of
me now that's never going to change
right it's not like it's not like
everybody's gonna listen to the context
so that's my permanent situation
I'm permanently banned or permanently
canceled there's there's no way to get
back because most of the country isn't
going to do any homework to find out
what's going on
right yeah the the book my books are all
canceled even the backlist even the
already published books are going to be
pulled off pulled off of Amazon and
everywhere else
right
so
in my opinion
reciprocity is the only thing that will
save us from ESG and
and the other you know victimization
demonization theories
uh watch out today there will be zero
media coverage of what I said just now
watch there will be zero media coverage
of my actual point
about the way we're being trained is
poisoning the people you can see it in
the the Rasmussen poll shows that people
are racially poisoned at the moment and
that that has an obvious outcome which
is not good and that we should
be more recip reciprocating
and it doesn't mean monetarily right
just do things that are good for each
other and things will be good
all right
yeah the MSN and and are you surprised
that let's say let's say if you're
surprised uh MSNBC never contacted me
for an interview
think about that
never asked
CNN never asked
let me there there were quite a few
media people who tried to contact me all
right so let me give credit to the ones
who did try to contact me
of all the newspapers that canceled me
how many of them contacted me before
deciding to cancel what's your guess
because remember these are news
organizations every one of these is a
news organization zero yeah
zero newspapers these are your news
sources zero newspaper zero even
contacted me and by the way they can all
contact me easily newspapers can get me
easily they just call my Call The
Syndicate and they connect me right in
the old days
so imagine that they're news Industries
and and none of them none of the ones I
mentioned contacted me all right since
then you know after the cancellation
started and it became a story how many
contacted me to get context
what would you guess
um maybe a dozen
almost everybody who contacted me was a
podcaster
who had not already said something about
me
pretty much
I don't think I'm trying to think of
anybody in the
major media
contacted me
people were asking me for a comment
that that's how they dealt with it that
there are a few of them asked me for a
quote
a quote
are you kidding me
how in the world is a quote going to
give you any context
that's like not even trying to do news
right now to be fair The Washington Post
did have a reporter who was talking to
me but I wasn't making comments but that
was after the fact so it was after the
Washington Post had already canceled me
then they got curious
or at least one one of their writers did
um
I make a great villain that's why Andrew
Tate said that's funny
yeah so would you say that nobody
accepted the podcasters wanted context
do you think that's a fair statement the
major media including the entire
newspaper industry didn't even ask for
context
didn't even have curiosity about the
story
yeah I haven't heard from uh Fox News
either
so Fox News so far is not covering that
I think they may have just covered it as
a news item but not an opinion
I think the opinion people have not
touched it
yeah so
how dangerous am I right now
think about it how dangerous am I to the
the way everything works
but what if people found out that their
opinions were assigned to them
by people who have a bad intentions
meaning that they're looking to make
money they're not looking to inform or
help you
yeah
now let me ask you this
what was what's the popular popularity
of the media have you seen any numbers
on that lately the the news media
their their popularity is like eight
percent or something like that
and
and they canceled me
think about it just think about this
they're the least trusted entity
I think maybe maybe less than Congress
I'm not sure but one of the least
trusted entities in the United States
canceled me
imagine how bad I would feel if I had
been canceled by anybody who was
respected or trusted
I'm not respected by anybody who's
respected or trusted you know the
media's now I let me let me adjust that
my cartoon syndication company
have been solid good people the whole
time they just didn't have any choice
you know they had to do what they had to
do but uh so they were they're not bad
people they're all good people at the
cartoon syndicate
yeah all right
um
so there's more to more to develop on
this story
it's uh surprising that being canceled
is uh
not as bad as you think okay here's why
it's not so bad
privately the the amount of support I'm
getting is just through the roof I've
never seen anything like it
but people don't want to necessarily
back me in public which I understand
totally understand but privately it's
it's all 100 percent
on my side 100 percent
the the one exception was somebody who
who had to uh make a show because his
wife was mad you know his wife had not
heard the context so she was mad so he
had to put on a show to you know show
that he was supporting his wife
but that doesn't count that's totally
allowed if you're supporting your spouse
say anything you are that's your first
job you know his job is not to make me
happy his job is to support his spouse
which he did
which he did
all right
um
you know wasn't Bill Burr
I've never talked to Bill Burr
big fan though
all right
Steve says uh you've been wanting to get
canceled for years
well that's another theory
all right uh let's see uh what do you
think is happening
what uh suing what would I sue for
what would I sue for
see the trouble is that the uh a trial
would look just like the real world
I don't think I could get a jury
to see things in context I think that
half of them would see it out of context
half would see it in even if they saw
the context probably
how do you get your books back well that
hasn't been worked out but in theory
the the canceling of me is such an
extreme economic Act
that I believe that and they've promised
to give me the rights back I believe
that they'll follow through on that I
think they will be professional and make
sure that happens
um
how many people are going to understand
that I was trying to shock the system
do you think anybody's going to figure
that out
the people on locals were in on it from
the beginning but
stop the hate well I wouldn't go that
far
yeah sometimes you got to shake the bugs
what would it take for me to re-identify
as black
it might be too late
although that would be funny wouldn't it
maybe I should identify as black again
well you know maybe that you know think
about it the whole time I identified as
black I never had any problems did I
that's a good idea well let's take a
vote should I identify as black because
I used to I used to identify as black
should I re-identify as black
because it's optional apparently anybody
can identify as anything
all right
I'll go I think I got one or two no's
shoe knows
uh the the new book is all and unknown
at this point in terms of the timing the
only thing I know is the Amazon already
says it's not being carried
that's all I know
so
um
bring back the garbage man philosopher I
have so many good ideas for the Dilbert
comic now
there's so many things
um it's still on Audible you know the
audible contract is a separate contract
so I don't know exactly how that's going
to work
I was wondering about that myself
it could be there's just a timing timing
issue and they'll cancel it
but here's one of the things I was
thinking of doing so my book hadn't
failed almost everything and still went
big
if if I get my rights back to that
that's the one that's ideal for black
Americans
so it's ideal for anybody who's young
but it's ideal for black Americans
specifically because it's sort of all
the things that you don't get told if
you don't have let's say a successful
business people or successful people in
your life
so it's basically the things that you
know parents would tell you if they were
wise parents if you had two of them you
know and you're raised just right and
all that but
it's sort of perfectly designed for a
young person
who doesn't have all the guidance that
they need
but anyway to finish my point I might
make it available just to homeschoolers
or
I'm not sure exactly but
I want to make sure that that penetrates
the home school Market because that's
where it's most useful
I will go I will go so far as to say
this
any young black kid who read that book
would probably do fine in life no matter
where they came from
like if you embraced what's in the book
which is hard if you're a teenager of
course right it's kind of hard to get a
teenager to focus on a self-help book
but
if they did it would be transformative
and almost everybody agrees with that
who's read the book
I got fooled somebody got fooled by the
well I was thinking that if if there's a
digital version of the book
there could be a like a free
homeschooler version then maybe I just
sell the curriculum guide for a dollar
or something
yeah it might be I'd have to monetize it
but I could monetize it cheap
make it a donation thing maybe
all right so let me ask you this
uh who has added more
to the race conversation in America
that I have
this week who's done more useful work in
this domain that I have this week name
anybody who did more
and no one
no one there's a giant red pill coming
for a lot of people
once people realize how much power
they've handed me and then how I use it
it's going to be a total mind
all right well the media will be sending
more me more energy and power today I'm
gonna go do some other stuff
um
wow
there's a lot of stuff that's going well
for me as well so don't worry about me
things are pretty good for me
um
this guy is insane
the media will stop talking about it
yeah
foreign
Rob so Rob was not here when I did the
uh the NPC stuff so he's doing NPC stuff
Rob we already said what the NPCs say
you picked one of them
you picked one of them
all right that's all for now YouTube I'm
gonna go talk to the locals people for a
minute bye for now
