do do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization we got
a lot of fun stuff to talk about today I
think today will be
one of the best live streams I've ever
done
well don't just take my word for it
you're gonna have to see it for yourself
if you like this experience to be
somewhere between DMT and Bud Light all
you need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker jealous is Diana canteen jogger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join us now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
ah
maybe what maybe Scott will allow
Dilbert to be the face of a revolution
I don't think Dilbert's really the face
of a revolution
yeah I don't think Dilbert's exactly
inspiring at least in that way
well let's see uh we'll get to the
DeSantis uh situation
but first that little science note
scientists have figured out how to make
electricity from Air
would you like to hear more about that
they can make electricity
from Air now it turns out that this is
something that could be done for a long
time
I think maybe 20 years ago an inventor
showed me a video of a little a little
Shack in which he was harvesting
electricity from the air just some kind
of static electricity or something now
the problem and it was actually
operating operating machinery
now the problem was that it wasn't
economical
so it wasn't really a good clean way to
get it electricity out of the air you
couldn't get enough so it might have
some you know
some use in space or something but
that's about it
well this new thing
makes electricity from Air
from any material
just hold that in your head for a moment
you could use any material
it doesn't have to be like nickel or
something here's all you have to do to
it you have to put holes in it
that's it
that's it you have to put holes in it
now the secret is that they're tiny
holes and that they're just the right
size
and what happens is that the normal
moisture in the air tries to get through
these little holes
the water the water in the air gets a
little bit slowed down or stock
and it creates momentarily a difference
in charge from one side of the material
to the other simply because it has tiny
holes
nothing else
nothing else just tiny holes
all you have to do is get the holes the
right size and it creates electricity
now you say to yourself
well how much can I create obviously not
much right but you can stack them
so you might have one little membrane
and then it's just on top of another
little membrane and I guess you can you
can make them as big as you want and
stack them as high as you want and some
people are saying it's going to be a big
deal
now I like to remind the people who
thought the climate models were telling
you everything you needed to know
as well as the people who said electric
cars will never work because we'll just
run out of electricity
you can't see what's coming
it would be impossible to know what's
going to happen in the next 30 Years
technology wise we didn't know in the
last 30 years why were we going to know
in the next 30 years it's just not
something that's knowable now I'm not
I'm not going to tell you that this
little weird little
battery situation
well not even a battery it's actually
creating energy it's not a storing it
I'm not going to tell you that this is
going to be the big breakthrough maybe
it's Fusion
baby is Gen 4 nuclear
maybe it's this new battery technology
so it's easy to restore them
maybe it's a hundred different things
but I can tell you for sure that the
climate models did not anticipate any of
it
so that's been my point from the start
is that
projections are always if you do
everything wrong look where you can end
up
and that never happens because you never
do everything wrong for 30 years in a
row that doesn't happen you may you make
some things right in 30 years
all right as you probably know by now
DeSantis announced his campaign for
presidency on Twitter's spaces feature
which is Audio Only
if you try to attend it as I did and
members of the locals Community who
followed me were with me and we tried to
listen to that thing and there were
massive technology problems
so how long did it take 15 or 20 did it
take 15 or 20 minutes to work out the
technical problems it felt like it was
something like that
and
here's how uh CNN covered the technical
problems
a huge disaster let's see
let's use use their exact words
um
glitches overshadow the announcement
so this is CNN the glitches overshadowed
the announcement it was a quote launch
disaster
and the DeSantis musk Alliance has been
a year in the making
and Twitter is turning into a right-wing
site
that so see you then you you have to
understand Twitter is now their
competitor for news
so when CNN covers a Twitter event
they're not going to be kind
that is not news
it's not news it's just marketing
CNN wants you to think that CNN is where
you should get the news and the
announcements
they don't want you to think that
Twitter's where you go go for that so of
course they dumped on it and they acted
like the the technical problem was the
story
do you think the Tactical problem was
the story
well all it did was bring attention to
it
if there had been no technical problems
they would have had less attention
what was Ron DeSantis trying to
accomplish
more attention
so yes so here's what the mainstream
media gets completely wrong they're
trying to sell you a narrative that the
technical problems that that are a
hundred percent Twitter's fault
are somehow a reflection of Ron
desantis's preparation
really
really you tried to sell us that
what year is it it's 20 23 people in
2023 I think we all got educated to
understand how an entrepreneur Works
musk how a how a software company that's
doing something it's never done before
which is host something on must account
of that size
and what I saw was everything working
the way you expected to work
how many of you thought spaces was going
to work perfectly when half a million
people came in for the first time ever
you know all at the same time
they've had bigger offense but not they
didn't they didn't all come in at the
same start time
yeah I mean so the fact that that
Twitter had a problem with it
I don't think hurt anybody
do you know what the sign ups are on
Twitter today
through the roof record a deal on musk
yeah so did Twitter do a bad job
yesterday because it was a technical
problem
well not if you judge by sign ups how
about follow the money
do you think the CNN reported that uh
Twitter has record signups because of
that event record signups like probably
the biggest day ever
no no they made it look like it was a
failure
unambiguously follow the money
Twitter made more money yesterday and
increased their base and power and
Prestige everything about that worked
for Twitter
that was 100 successful
the the the people who are competing
with Twitter
have to find something bad about it and
you know put that on DeSantis so people
don't want to use Twitter for this in
the future but I don't think it worked
at all
I think that from the Public's
perspective here's what they took away
Ron DeSantis is using a more modern form
of campaigning
is that good or bad
Ron DeSantis understands modern forms of
campaigning it's all good that's 100
good
there was a big delay in you know in the
technology and everybody's talking about
it bad or good
well if everybody is talking about it
and they're signing up for Twitter like
crazy
I don't even know how that could have
been better if you're trying to get
attention
um
here's something I said in the man cave
last night when I was just talking to
locals people
uh
well hold off on that
uh he hit you with that later when it's
in its proper place
so here are some of the things that
DeSantis
said and did I'll give you my persuasion
um grade for DeSantis
so the first thing you have to consider
is that it wasn't an interview I thought
it was going to be more of a
conversation interview with maybe a
little pushback
but it wasn't now given that it wasn't
an interview
I'm not going to grade it as an
interview
it should be graded as an announcement
would you agree
it should be treated as just a speech an
announcement because all they did is
really introduce them and then let him
talk basically you know with a little
little variation in that but basically
they just let him talk
so there were things he was not asked
about
for example I don't think Trump ever
came up
am I wrong I think he made one passing
reference to Trump
being too woke which made me laugh
because you know he's got a little
argument there he didn't he didn't
explain his argument but there you know
there's a little bit of an argument that
he's a little less woke than Trump I
suppose you know you could you could
make it sound like that I mean it's not
true
but you can make it sound like that if
you want to
so not mentioning Trump was brilliant
because what would have happened if the
mainstream media was the ones who who
handled this
what questions would the mainstream
media ask DeSantis
nothing but Trump questions they would
have just asked him one Trump question
after another and it would have turned
into a trump event
but by doing it on Twitter and not
having questions per se
um
you know he could just handle it any way
he wanted and that and that was good
um some more things look overall I would
say that desantis's presentation Style
uh was a plus plus
on persuasion
the only negative he has is that he
sounds like an AI generated voice and he
does not have the Zing that Trump breaks
he doesn't have a Sizzle there's a
complete lack of sizzle
however
allow me to give him a compliment for
handling his lack of sizzle
the worst thing he could have done is to
try to compete with Trump
by our sizzling him
how would that go it would look like
Mario Rubio yeah it would look like
Rubio
trying to joke with Trump about you know
penis size it just wouldn't work because
you can't you can't go to Trump's home
court and expect to win a game you're
not going to win on his home court
you've got to say I'm playing a
different game and then play it better
than he's playing his game
and I think that's what DeSantis is
doing because he characterized himself
as a quote
energetic executive
that oh what do you think about that an
energetic executive that's how he
described himself
perfect
it's perfect because because that he's
not competing with Trump for the sizzle
and it's a Sizzle that gets Trump in
trouble
now I'm not going to be over there
sizzling and getting in trouble I'll be
over here getting stuff done
now countering Trump as opposed to
competing with them is exactly the right
play so politically
it appears he's getting good advice let
me ask you this
do you think DeSantis is getting good
political advice
does it look like it
I'm saying yeses and news
what would be an example of the now
okay I got lots of examples of yeses but
what would be an example of no what was
he doing wrong
to some next
hiding too long well no he was just
getting ready to announce
he's not going to be hiding overly
scripted
yeah okay so
uh
I would say that in terms of describing
what the problems are and then
describing how he could be the right
person to solve them I don't think I've
ever seen better
I would say in terms of selling himself
as a capable energetic executive
that's what I saw
I saw somebody who did a perfect sale
for an energetic executive here but
here's what what makes that tricky
if you think he's competing with Trump
to be more Trump than Trump
than it doesn't look like he did it
right it looks like he didn't do that
but he's not trying to do that and I
don't think that trying to do that would
have been the right play he's trying to
carve out his own unique brand and then
he's selling that brand and I thought he
sold the hell out of it that was one of
the best
probably one of the best just
communication jobs you'll ever see
now I've said before that Vivek is
almost unparalleled in his communication
skills and he brings a little more
a little more X Factor a little more
zing
but you know he's he's starting from way
behind DeSantis has got a big advantage
on him so DeSantis as a capable smart
person who can say these are the
problems and here's what I'll do about
them
you nailed it a plus plus
however as Trump points out maybe he
needs a personality transplant
so he'll never be as exciting and that
does matter and Trump knows it Trump
knows that people will vote for
entertainment
I hate to admit it but I'm very biased
by entertainment
I'm very likely to vote for somebody who
looks good or sounds good or makes me
laugh
I don't like to admit it I mean it
doesn't make me look good but I know
myself and I know that I am influenced
by those things
absolutely
um
so let's see what else
words that DeSantis tried to focus on
for his his uh let's say his brand would
be focusing on Merit you know the system
should be
the United States should be merit-based
you know not based on your color uh
based on sanity and of course that's an
indirect
indirect attack on both Trump and on
crazy Democrat stuff so he wants to
bring insanity and then Integrity of
Institutions which I think we're all
caring about at the moment
those are good those in terms of selling
his brand
that's right on brand
um
yeah
so I think
um given that musk is making this
available to everybody
he is getting a lot of unfair
um attacks muscus for
apparently looking like he's a right
wager now
because he gave DeSantis a platform to
really showcase
but he says publicly and he just tweeted
it today that all the presidential
candidates are invited and I would
assume it would be the same basis
meaning that they would get to talk and
there wouldn't be a lot of pushback and
they just get to put their thing out
there now as long as there are other
places that the candidates can debate
and other places that they could get
challenged by the interviewer I think
you have everything you need I like the
fact that DeSantis just got one really
big you know announcement platform so he
could put out there everything he wants
to put out there and now other people
can you know poke at it and push it and
but now it's out there so I thought that
was a great service
I appreciate it and I was mostly
entertained he got a little boring
toward the end
all right uh here's my favorite subplot
of that entire thing number one is the
simulation kidding us when it has Elon
Musk
uh buying a feature on Twitter called
spaces
like he's literally the space guy
and then just a coincidence that the
feature he's using is called spaces I
don't know just weird quizzes there's a
few more of those but here's the
question I ask I would love to know what
happened
when they went live and they had the
technical problems
because the way they solved it was
according to musk that having all that
traffic on musk's account
has a different impact than when they
made it work by moving into David sack's
account
it has something to do with the
uniqueness of his account or the number
of followers or something but they it
crashed until they figured out how to
move it to Saks account and their
starter from there and then it worked
now
wouldn't you love to know how that
conversation went in real time
because here's my question
who solved that it turns out because I
was telling I was telling my followers
at the time you know the the locals
people I was saying if it's a volume
related problem they're not going to fix
it if it's just volume there's just
nothing you can do in real time you're
gonna have to go back and retool and try
it again
but it turns out it wasn't just volume
it was a combination of Volume Plus the
unique account it was coming from
and here's my question who figured that
out
who who knew that moving into the other
account would make it work when it was
the same amount of volume
and I have I have a hypothesis
that because the person sitting there
being embarrassed by it not working is
the most storied engineer in the history
of the United States Elon Musk
and don't you wonder if he told the
engineers to try that based on intuition
that that probably would be a way to go
or did the engineers suggested
to Elon which way did it go
are you curious about that because if
Elon is the one who figured it out in
real time that that sort of goes more to
his Legend
that you know you would be
hypothetically
you know surrounded by the top engineers
in the in Twitter and he had to tell
them how to fix it that might have
happened
you know I I have no reason to believe
it did except that he's the most storied
engineer and he was in charge and he was
the one who wanted it fixed so I kind of
wonder if he thought of it
I just I'm just so curious about that
that little technical question
anyway
um
the Trump did everybody see the Trump
parody that came out right after so
apparently he had been prepared in
advance and it showed the spaces page
which is just a page of profiles of
different participants except the parody
version the only participants were uh
besides musk and DeSantis there was a
Hitler Soros Klaus Schwab Satan and Dick
Cheney and the FBI
now I can't do it justice
you have to listen to it like this this
one falls into the category of
you know for the is one of the best of
all time it's not just funny it's one of
the best political uh humorous parodies
you'll ever see it was just genius so go
see it it's on you can see it on
choose social you can see it on Twitter
on my account and a number of releases
but you you it's worth five minutes
you trust me just trust me on this one
this is five minutes you will not regret
all right
um oh let's talk about uh DeSantis one
of the things he he talked about with
the wokeness that he's against is you
know getting into college and he's and
he uses visual language he said talk
about you know your daughter who's going
to college and saying you don't want her
to be roadkill in the woke Olympics
and if you listen to everything that the
Santa said
it was sort of a brilliant example of
visual language because he was on an
audio only platform
but when he talked you could see
pictures forming in your head
that's not normal
that's not normal that's somebody who's
probably been trained
in Persuasion by somebody who knows what
they're doing because I don't think that
was part of his normal tool bag that
that stood out it stood out as being
obviously visual
um preparation
and very well done
um
let's see here's what uh see CNN's uh
page was hilarious if you just look at
the headlines in the top left of CNN's
page because that's where they want they
put the stuff they want you to see first
that's what they think is important
so here are the headlines why DeSantis
is as dangerous as Trump
completely predictable was that oh yeah
DeSantis is totally normal unless it's
possible he could win well if he could
win then he's just as dangerous as Trump
right otherwise he's just a normal sane
person and nothing like Trump whatsoever
unless he could win and then he's just
as dangerous
you don't even have to read the article
it's the headlines that are funny
uh what else they say they said the
glitches overshadowed the show it
launched disaster
blah blah
yeah so let's see what um New York Times
said
um oh here's some other things CNN said
that he was they were sending a message
of incompetence the DeSantis was trying
to be the the capable competent
executive but his launch was incompetent
so that's you know against his brand
that's not what I saw what I saw is
Twitter had some issues because so many
people wanted to see him
if if you ever have a chance to fail
and somebody gives you a chances of ways
to fail hey Scott I'll give you 10
different options of how to fail
pick the one that makes you look popular
I failed because too many people wanted
to hear my message
that's what CNN is calling a failure
the technology broke
it's a it's a mass it's built as a mass
communication product you know Twitter
and and the spaces is meant for Mass
audiences and he brought such a mass
audience he broke it
but it got fixed by maybe the most
storied engineer of all time in America
in real time
I
could be more perfect like you can't
even get you could not have scripted
that better than having it fail because
too many people wanted to hear it that's
you can't get better
all right
they said it was predictable CNN said
Twitter's problems were predictable
Givens Twitter's you know recent
technical problems in the past
was it
all right maybe maybe the risk
was higher than normal I would agree
with that but was it predictable that it
wouldn't work
was that predictable
Twitter didn't know but CNN somehow new
yeah it's all predictable
um
and they said there is such a thing as
negative attention
so they're trying to make the case that
he brought out negative attention
no he didn't
no he didn't it's not negative attention
when there are too many people who want
to hear you that's positive attention
sorry that's positive
all right New York Times did some fact
checking and I will use the
um the lawyer standard for this
which is if you can see that one of the
fact checks is obviously fake it's a
fake fact check meaning it's just
propaganda you don't have to listen to
the other fact checks would you agree
if one of them is obviously just
propaganda you can ignore all the rest
as well all right
um so the fact checked DeSantis saying
the whole book ban thing is a hoax so
the accusation is that Florida is
Banning books but desanta says the whole
book band thing is a hoax there's not
been a single book banned in the State
of Florida you can go buy or use
whatever book you want
they fact check that this way they said
it's misleading it's misleading so I
hope that they're not misleading in
their fact check wouldn't that be
terrible
because their whole point is that he's
misleading
so he's misleading they say because
there has been no state where I'd banned
a book oh so he's completely right
because he said there's no Statewide ban
on books oh that's misleading oh but
it's misleading because but Mr DeSantis
is vastly playing down the extent to
which individual school districts and
libraries and parts of the states have
removed books in fact Florida ranks
second behind Texas as the state with
the most bans at 357.
um did they leave anything out of the
story
is already fundamentally important part
of the story that the New York Times
left out when they were telling you that
DeSantis was being misleading anything
left out
that the bands were specifically about
material that was too adult for children
that's it
it was two adult material
for the age of the children
do you know how many other books are
banned everywhere because they're too
adult for the age of the children
probably a hundred million
is there is there any place on Earth
that doesn't
restrict pornography from children
the New York Times is actually in favor
of
adult material for children
don't you think that they should have
mentioned that in the fact check that it
only applied to material that they
thought children were not ready for but
when those children reach an age where
their minds can handle it it is 100
available
100 available to adults
you don't think the New York Times knew
that and thought that maybe that was
important to the fact check
they leave that out
so therefore you are free to say that
all their other fact checks are
they're probably not I mean some of them
probably are right
but you you were allowed to say there's
no credibility to their fact checking
because this one's obviously
just obviously they know it they could
not know it
uh NBC this is their take on it and I
remember
NBC is also a competitor to Twitter for
political news so they're going to talk
about them as a competitor
um
and here's their take Democratic
strategist said the joint must distant
this event was only the latest example
of the tech billionaire aligning himself
in Twitter with increasingly
conservative politics in our right word
shift
do you think that's what happened
or do you think you said
every candidate is is invited and one of
them said yes
it's not some right word shift the right
word shift is what the is the narrative
that their competitors are trying to put
on
right it's a there's purely a
competitive statement it's not news it's
propaganda well it's not even propaganda
it's marketing
it's less than propaganda propaganda at
least
even propaganda cells better than
marketing I guess that's my bias but all
NBC is just marketing their own product
but they're making the customers think
oh that's news no it's not no that's
just marketing
yeah
um oh here's a I thought this was an
insightful as usual comment from Mike
cernovich about uh DeSantis versus Trump
this is a really important point
and as Mike points out I think is
undervalued so I agree with
um servich so here's what he says in the
Tweet DeSantis can hire people who won't
see it as their last job
it's a very good job in other words if
you take a job with Trump might be the
last time you ever work
now I I'm actually an example of that do
you think I would have been canceled if
not you know known as a past Trump
supporter
probably not probably wouldn't care
um
however I find this correct so sermon
says this is underweighted by people who
aren't professionals
that's right if you're a professional
you know that your reputation and who
you've associated with will determine
your next career Arc and as cerno says
you're Trump's lawyer that might be your
last final client before I'm being
disbarred
and then he says to online people stuff
like this doesn't matter in the in the
real world is huge and I agree with that
completely
if you're looking at DeSantis or anybody
else
versus Trump
I don't know who Trump hires to work for
it was a problem before but it's
probably a bigger problem now because at
least he had Jared and Ivanka who in my
opinion were superstars of the
administration
I think there was really strong and
useful players but it looks like they
won't be involved if Trump wins so it's
hard to know what his you know Inner
Circle would look like and how that
would work
so it's I think this is an entirely
valid point
that a professional going to work for
DeSantis would think that's a stepping
stone in their career whereas working
for Trump has shown its it's a career
suicide and and I can prove it if you'd
like an example of a career suicide
right here
RFK Jr had an interesting comment I
think it was on Megyn Kelly about Trump
and he said that Trump is the best
debater since Abraham Lincoln
he said quote president Trump has shown
himself to be the most devastating
debater probably since Abraham Lincoln
he said and RFK JR says the key to this
so-called success is Trump's quote
capacity to obliterate and dispatch
opponents
and he thinks that Biden would just get
you know rolled if he debated him now of
course RFK Jr wants
to bait Biden into a debate
so so this is probably part of his you
know uh is priming to see if he can get
a debate going which I doubt I don't
think it's going to happen but
once again
you find something to love about RFK Jr
how do the Kennedys do that
like well like why why does it take a
Kennedy to just keep picking out like
winning win frames
that's a totally winning frame do you
know why
is it obvious to you why RFK Jr
complimenting Trump's um
his debating skill is it obvious to you
why that's a good strategy
well let me tell you why
he wants to win Trump supporters
and he's the only person who ever tried
am I right he's trying as a Democrat
he's trying to win Trump supporters and
he's the only one who's ever tried and I
think to myself oh wait a minute
did you just show respect to Trump
supporters
he actually showed respect
and there wasn't a butt there you know
you're waiting for the butt
he's a great debater but
and there was just no no bug
he he's confident enough that he can
compliment his you know potential
competitor he could give him a
full-throated compliment and just let it
let it sit there
that is so baller strong
don't don't you interpret that as
strength
he doesn't need to shut him down he can
say what you see well you see it you see
it with your own eyes I'm not going to
deny what you see with your own eyes
let's accept that is true and then I
have this other basket of stuff I'm
offering
I this
you can't beat that
like and and honestly does it it makes
you wonder do the Kennedys have some
extra speed or something like how the
hell did how the hell can they all do it
it's like you just have to be born with
that last name and you can do that
show respect
to citizens of the country that disagree
with you that's pretty strong and he's
the only person who's running
that people are saying do you think he
could be a good vice president for Trump
how many times have you heard that which
is crazy
there's no way that's going to happen
but but just think about the fact that
so many people have suggested it
have you ever heard that before in your
whole life your whole life have you ever
seen anybody suggest that a major
Democrat candidate should be the vice
president for the Republican candidate
that's crazy talk but only RFK Jr has
ever been treated that way
the the other thing that I love about
him is that even if it turns out he was
totally wrong about let's say childhood
vaccinations and I don't have a strong
opinion about that except that I agree
they're under tested I don't know it's
real
I disagree with him that they're
woefully under tested
but even if it turns out he was wrong
and I know you think he's not but
suppose he did
he would still be a hell of a candidate
and I think that would be his biggest
weakness and I don't even see it as one
because even that was sincere
and even that was at least attempted to
be completely data-driven scientifically
compatible without believing big Pharma
so so he's he's carved down the place
where you can believe science but
disbelieve all the corporations who are
doing the science
Kind of Perfect
right
because everybody else is sort of the
the simplistic idiots science is bad or
science is good experts are bad experts
are good and he's very cleanly made this
distinction science is good
but the corporate science is all bad
to which all of us say well that's true
we love science we just hate it when
corporations pay for it
so anyway the reason that RFK Jr will
would never be
Trump's vice president if we could put
this to bed so nobody asked me about it
anymore
nobody's going to pick a 70 year old
vice president
can we just stop there
is there anything else I need to say
I mean I could have started with
nobody's going to pick a Democrat to be
vice president for a republican because
that's also true
but nobody's going to take a 70 year old
vice president
especially if you're elderly at yourself
right I mean Biden won't either Biden's
not going to pick a 70 year old vice
president
so there's no way that that's going to
happen
it's just amazing that it comes up so
much that tells you something about how
people are thinking
you say it's bad on the climate
um I'm gonna I'm gonna Reserve judgment
on that
so it's my opinion so far that RFK Jr is
not compatible with current science
on nuclear energy and climate I don't
think he's fully compatible with what I
understand to be the best science
doesn't mean I'm right
but he is so far demonstrated a
a legitimate mental flexibility and an
ability to understand complicated things
that I suppose his opinion could change
because the facts seemed to be changing
right so I believe he could evolve or or
find a nuanced position that you
wouldn't hate
uh he has not shown that yet would you
agree I would say that his climate
framing is not
is not compatible with the right and
that's a big problem
but I think he could do it
I think he has the skill and I think
there's room to do it just by slightly
modifying or updating his understanding
of a nuclear energy for one thing it
might be enough it might be all it takes
but he could get pretty close to the
Republican take just by doubting uh
projections
which wouldn't be hard right he's a he's
a science yes but skepticism yes at the
same time
he he wears both hats
just as often so he could get away with
a nuanced take on climate don't don't
count them out on that just wait and see
on that but you're right he is not he's
not his game is not where it needs to be
on climate
we all agree on that right if he wants
to get any votes from the right he's not
where he needs to be
but but hold on he might you might find
a way
um
all right we'll test your IQ in case you
want to see how genius you are about all
things political
Rasmussen had a poll
and they asked the question was uh
likely U.S voters they said how many
people believe the FBI officials
involved in promoting the false Russia
Trump claim should be criminally
prosecuted and how many should not
so our test will be how many people how
many of the voters think the FBI
officials involved in promoting a hoax
that tried to overthrow the government
what percentage do you think just
roughly let's say within two basis
points
see if he can get it within two and then
I'll be impressed
27's wrong
now 27 is wrong but try to get it within
two
23 yes very very good estimate 23 of
Voters think that the FBI uh should not
be criminally prosecuted for trying to
overthrow the country with a hoax
yeah yeah
if anybody's new you don't know why
we're laughing sort of an inside joke
for this live stream that
roughly a quarter of the public will get
every question wrong it doesn't matter
what the question is now I don't think
it's the same quarter of the public that
gets every question wrong it's probably
like a different quarter for every
question but it's always about a quarter
the the regularity with which that you
know one out of four shows up is just
crazy
it just doesn't even look like it could
be natural
all right
let's talk about uh Ukraine so we know
maybe a little bit more about the
attacks on Russia proper so Russia says
that it was Ukraine that was behind
sending some drones toward the Kremlin
and you probably believe that don't you
it was probably Ukraine was involved
unless it was a total false flag
you know it might have been a whole fake
but then we also know that there were
some
alleged Russian citizens who allegedly
were against Russia's involvement in the
war and against Putin and they allegedly
crossed the border from Ukraine into
Russia and attacked in a few places in
Russia
which would be you know an escalation of
attacks on Russian Homeland
now do you think that those minor
attacks you know didn't it didn't end up
conquering any territory that they held
and a few citizens got killed and it
didn't amount to much but do you think
it was a success
do you think those incursions with the
you know somewhat sketchy artificially
created
Russian you know revolutionaries do you
think it worked
I think it did if the Russian people
heard about it which I don't know I I'm
guessing they did but it works
psychologically
because if you're a Russian Citizen and
you know you you oppose the war in
Ukraine you're probably saying to
yourself well
it's over there it's not affecting me
you know I still go to work I'm still
buying groceries doesn't have an effect
and if you don't know somebody
personally
who's in that war or got killed or
wounded then you're probably thinking
well just let Putin do what he does
we'll see how it works out
but as soon as you hear that Ukraine is
attacking your Homeland
that changes everything
doesn't it
and I was trying to put my my head in
that place
imagine the United States
gets into some war with Iraq or anybody
else
and then imagine that there's a
substantial
attack on the Homeland where an actual
City in city in America
like stuff blows up and there's firing
and soldiers and it's like fighting in
the streets
could you hold that in your head
yeah so it'd be like 9 11 exactly or
Pearl Harbor is a better example
what did the United States do when Pearl
Pearl Harbor happened
now we may have been you know there's
theories about we knew more than we knew
Etc but when the homeland of the United
States has attacked do we act the same
as as when our military is attacked in a
war that's in a theater
we don't no if you attack the Homeland
we just drop all the rules
all right we got all these rules about
what's fair in war and what's not and
we're going to follow the rules because
we like to be good rule following
military you know we'll try not to do
any atrocities we won't use the really
bad weapons unless we have to you know
follow the rules and then they attack
the Homeland what's the first thing we
do when they attack the Homeland
get rid of all the rules
yeah the rules go away
so you don't act the same when your
Homeland is attacked I don't know if it
works the same in Russia
but I wouldn't be surprised
you know people or people mostly so I
would imagine that the psychology of the
Russian people changed but because of
the nature of the war it's sort of
cousin on cousin the war I don't know if
that makes them want to fight harder
it certainly would in America if anybody
hits American soil we just open our
pocketbooks and say whatever this costs
hey military
whatever this costs
go do that
it's going to be really expensive yeah
go do that go do that uh we'll probably
be killing a lot of citizens and
innocent people in the process
okay
because it's the Homeland
all right so I think that those attacks
are a successful psychologically
probably a good idea
I think it's funny that 4 out of seven
of the GOP candidates for president or
people of color
four out of seven
that's pretty good
right you got your Tim Scott your Larry
Elder
um your
um
uh you've got uh obviously uh
ramaswamy and who am I forgetting uh
Nikki hilley yeah and Nikki hilley so
the top the only three who were
announced for Democrats are three uh
white people
so the Democrats are running three white
people
and the Republicans all those big old
racists
four out of seven candidates for people
of color
four and a seven
but but at least the Democrats have more
women vote uh women running right
nope it's a tie
it's a tie they got Marianne Williams
and the right has Nikki Haley so why is
it the people who vote for Democrats is
it for
increase diversity
now I love I love the look of that
because it's so uh so counter narrative
and if Trump were to select uh Tim Scott
as his running mate
then that's super anti-narrative
Mike Pence I think didn't help in terms
of the brand he was a great vice
president stayed that in trouble
but Tim Scott would actually help
I mean he would be in addition to the to
the whole brand that would be very
substantial I think more so than most
vice presidents
so
anyway that's funny uh here's an update
on Bud Light apparently they're having
so much trouble selling Bud Light now
and my some of us going bad on the
shelves if you wait too long you can't
sell it you have to throw it away and so
Anheuser-Busch is offering all these
rebates and stuff to the retailers and
some of the rebates are so big that the
beer is free
and it actually says so after rebate
it's free
so they went from
selling beer
to having to lower the price of their
beer
to now lowering the price of the beer to
free
what happens if free doesn't work
well if history is any judge what's
going to happen is if they can't give it
away for free
they'll probably team up with big Pharma
and
they'll tell people that Bud Light is
rumored to cure covid as effectively as
Ivermectin and hydroxyl chloroquine
combined
and then big Pharma
will have to support Bud Light and not
only support it but it might become
mandatory
it might become mandatory
so I can see a place where once big
Pharma realizes that
uh
anyway you see where I'm going I don't
have to I don't have to
beat that joke into the ground
yeah that's where it's going it's went
from you have to buy it to we'll pay you
to drink it to it's going to be
mandatory and you have to do you have to
drink at least a case of Bud Light
before you're allowed to operate a motor
vehicle
all right
um I read an interesting article by
Helen Andrews in the American
conservative
as apparently there are two very
important lawsuits going on the first
one in California where they're trying
to get rid of the SAT and the ACT tests
for college admissions
do you know why it's so that they can
get more minority participation because
some groups do not do well on those
entry exams
um
in fact
a study in 2013 showed that if Harvard
um
had not used affirmative action in other
words if they just let people in based
on their scores and their objective
performance
that Harvard would have had 43 percent
Asian
38 white and 0.7 percent black
so although there are only 5.6 percent
of Asians in America they would have
been 43 percent of Harvard
um
and then blacks would be less than one
percent
so that that's what it would be if they
used so they're trying to get rid of the
perform the tests but also in Yale
I guess Yale's in trouble
um
because Asian Americans and whites have
only one tenth to one-fourth of the
likelihood of admission compared to
Black American applicants
imagine imagine being uh well you
probably don't have to imagine it if you
are but Asian Americans
having a one-tenth the chance of getting
into an Ivy League school
one-tenth the chance
with higher qualifications
higher qualifications
but only one tenth the chance
I don't think that big colleges can
survive
this is a really bad look
it's just terrible
now one of the things that DeSantis said
in his announcement is that he would use
the Department of Education
to take accreditation away from
universities
that were woke
so if a university was promoting woke
stuff they wouldn't be accredited at the
moment it's opposite at the moment you
have to be woke to get credited
accredited
now the problem with this plan it sounds
brilliant on the surface the problem is
that as soon as there's a Democrat
president
did they just reverse it back again
maybe not because wherever you at
becomes a little bit sticky it's hard to
change things maybe if you change it it
could stay the way DeSantis wants it
maybe but I had never heard that idea
before I've only heard that people
wanted to get rid of the Department of
Education
but to Santa says let's keep it and use
it as a weapon and I thought
is that brilliant
give me a fact check on that because
well when I heard it it sounded
brilliant and Innovative and smarter
than any anything anybody else was doing
but is there a problem with it that's
not obvious
all schools in California would close
let the states decide well if you let
the states decide
well I guess that makes sense
constitutionally of course but I wonder
how it would fall out you'd still have a
lot of woke universities
maybe wouldn't it be interesting if a
university marketed itself as non-woke
see what happened
it's probably too early to do that but I
think that's where we're heading
anyway how many of you would agree with
the fact that wokeness has hit some kind
of a peak
which doesn't say there won't be more of
it right I'm not talking about an end
I'm talking about a peak you know after
the peak there's lots lots lots more but
it would be slowly declining in power
and relevance
because here's what I say I I see now
that is now safe to challenge woke ideas
directly and I don't think he was safe
before
would you agree
there's just a little bit more you can
say than you could have said even one
year ago and partly that's because of
the boycotts I think the boycotts work
I'm usually anti-boycott but it seems
pretty clear that the Bud Light and now
the target you know target has sold some
trans friendly clothing that people in
the right don't like
um
by the way I don't really understand the
target one
because the target one I guess they were
accused of selling uh
tuck friendly
swimwear to minors but they weren't
they only had adult sizes so do you
really care if Target sells clothes to
trans
like why is that a problem
adult clothes to adult trans
how in the world is that a problem
yes you have a problem with that but why
but why do you have a problem if other
people want to wear clothes
like the store is full of clothes that I
don't wear
do you care that stores carry both men's
and women's clothes
because you only wear one of them
I don't know how you can be mad about
that
but independent of whether the boycott
makes sense or doesn't make sense and I
think it I think the boycott was based
on people thought it was
kids clothes
now the fact check is that it was never
kids closed they do have I think
lgbtq friendly clothes
but the the tuck one for the trans that
was adult sizes only that's that's their
defense I'll just tell you what they're
saying
I can't say that they're telling the
truth
it was the in your face display
I'm telling you the truth they did sell
uh clothes for
lgbtq children
true
the tuck it swimsuits which were the the
thing that got featured in the news were
only adult sizes true or false
Michael Scott Howard said I'm 100
incorrect
what do you say
now I think that you're believing your
news sources when you say I'm wrong
right
you're saying I'm wrong because you saw
a news source that said something else
well did
did Matt Walsh debunked it
so you're saying that the fact check was
wrong
all right
um I would say it's
here's my uh
here's my trick for identifying the fake
news
suppose you had never heard this story
so here's just a way to identify fake
news suppose you'd never heard the story
about the target thing so you don't know
anything
and then somebody came in and said hey
they're selling tuck swimwear to
children
would you believe it if you answered
anything about this story
and you heard they were selling tuck
friendlies swimweared children would you
believe it
the answer is no you would not believe
it
that's probably what is true
if I told you they were selling lgbtq
friendly clothing to Children meaning it
could have you know messages and colors
and images on it would you think that
sounded impossible or true
pretty normal I would think that was
true
so the common sense view of this is that
they did in fact promote lgbtq let's say
Lifestyles and fashion
and that's not even that strange or
weird or anything
but if you told me that they rarely sold
tuck friendly swimwear to children
I'm going to say I don't believe that
ever was a thing
I don't believe it now can we test this
how about we test it
so I'm going to make just one very uh
narrow claim that you cannot produce a
photo of a child size
for tuck friendly swimmer
if you can produce that you know this
has Target on it and it's obviously a
child's size then I would like to
correct myself
so I'm open to be correct to being
corrected can will you take that bet
let's take this as a challenge just to
see how how the filter works right so a
number of you are claiming Superior
information
so when you when you were fact checking
me here is because you believed you had
better information than I have more
current information or more accurate
right that might be true
so if you'll allow me
I'd like to say that might be true that
could be the whole story
however it's a good test to buy filter
my filter says I'm not even going to
look for that story I wouldn't even fact
check it because I would believe it's so
obvious it's not true I would never even
look for the truth I would just assume
it wasn't
but you're claiming that I'm wrong with
that filter and that it really did
happen so if you can produce for me
maybe on Twitter or somewhere else a
a credible picture
of a child-sized tuck swimwear sold at
Target
then you're right
do you accept the challenge
it's very simple you just have to show
me one example and then then you're
right there's nothing else to say and
even if it's just one store one time
you're 100 right can we agree on that I
won't try to weasel out
by saying oh that was one store
okay we agree if it was either one story
you're right
my belief is it never happened in any
store anywhere
all right so let's test it and if I'm
wrong I'm wrong and then I'll tell you
right simple as that I'm not going to be
the guy who just needs to be right about
talked swimwear like I don't have any I
have no ego invested in that whatsoever
but I'm very curious whether the filter
is working this time it might not be it
might not be
crazier things have happened
but not often
all right
um
are you gaslighting target took it down
two days ago so case somebody says are
you gaslighting target took it down two
days ago
uh are are you saying that therefore it
would be hard to get a picture because
they already took it away
oh well okay maybe
no I'm not gaslighting it so I promise
you
I'm not gaslighting you
I I'm simply using my rule that if
something sounds ridiculous it probably
didn't happen
that's all that that's my entire
intellectual
approach if it sounds ridiculous and
it's in the news it probably didn't
happen
here it is somebody says well I can't
check it without turning off the thing
oh look at that yes sir
um
yeah you have to watch out for it being
photoshopped
it sounds ridiculous to give porn to
kids well
if it was important it'd be ridiculous
if they thought they were educating them
on sex education we've had we've had
debates forever
about what is too young and too far
so that's not completely crazy
that somebody had a different opinion of
how young and how far
that's a discussion that's been going on
forever
but the tuck swimwear would be kind of
new
all right
send me a link
what would you consider a uh
a believable link on this
oh let me do this
let me see what uh bing says
I know I know I'm not I'm not saying
that Bing is objective I'm just curious
what they say about it
all right I'll say uh
did Target
sell
trans took
friendly
swimwear
what do you think it's going to tell me
swimwear
where four children
you know it's going to say no right
it no matter what the real answer is
it's going to say no
uh Snopes
let's try stuff I know
I know you don't have to tell me you
don't have to tell me you don't believe
Snopes I'm just telling you what they
said
uh because of Snopes agreed with you
then I'd say Well that's
pretty
uh
[Music]
um
all right so they they say it's false
so Snopes says targets 20 23 Pride
collection includes items labeled in
stores as talk friendly but none of
these are available in kid sizes
designed for children or marketed to
children
but Matt Walsh said
uh
uh
it's a video
a viral video of Matt Walsh's refers to
two items with a
 all right so so this is probably
what you're talking about if you saw
Matt Walsh
so they're talking about what Matt well
says so the viral videos referencing two
items with a tag highlighting the
bathing suits tuck friendly construction
blah blah uh uh
several viral videos said you will find
these in the kids section
both these products can be found on
their website
neither of them is designed for children
claims that the products were for kids
appears to come from an apparent
disbelief in the notion that some adults
are small
and the fact that some pride collections
were near a children's clothing section
uh so Walsh says either those Sciences
are for kids
or for very very very small adults
um
so I was once married
to a size zero woman
and
it was so annoying that she could she
could pack all the clothes she would
need for a two-week vacation in a
carry-on
like a hundred percent of all of her
clothes could be squished down to like
something you put in your hand and it
would be like three weeks of different
outfits
[Laughter]
did she talk
no well so it does it come down to uh
oh I was going to say something terrible
I was going to say something terrible
but I pulled back
uh let me think about it for a minute
because it's terrible
I can't do it I can't do it
it was pretty funny in my mind but I
can't do it
all right I might tell the locals people
after I get off of YouTube all right
I'll make I'll make a deal I'll tell the
people in locals because they pay a
subscription so they can get the good
stuff I'll also tell you a little bit
what I said I wouldn't tell you
yesterday
because I told some of the people in the
man cave live stream yesterday
that there was something I couldn't tell
but I I found a way I could tell you
without
violating any uh ethical Hang-Ups
all right
that's all for now uh best live stream
we've ever seen
until tomorrow
bye YouTube
