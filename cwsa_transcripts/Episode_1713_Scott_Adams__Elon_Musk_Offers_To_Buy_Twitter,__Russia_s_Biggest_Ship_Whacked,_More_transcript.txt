good morning everybody whoa
do you look good looking today
you know often
you're attractive but there's something
a little extra sexy about you today and
i think you know it
do you know that you have blundered into
the highlight of civilization called
coffee with scott adams there is no
better feeling
and
it's going to go up a level yeah from no
better feeling to no no better feeling
plus
turbo extreme and all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker
chelsea's dine a canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine hit of the
day with a little bit of oxytocin
we're going to sprinkle that in toward
the end it's called the simultaneous sip
but it happens now go
now
when you saw the news today which you
probably did
that elon musk has offered to buy
twitter did you say to yourself
well that's a perfect topic for a coffee
with scott adams because i did i did
i'll bet some of you did too
and we'll get to that in a moment
but i like this story do you know what
an nft is those of you who follow
anything crypto
if you don't follow crypto i'm going to
describe it to you very simply
and you're you're going to think i'm
leaving something out
if you think of leaving something out
then you understand it completely
an nft is a digital image
same kind of thing you can get from
let's say making a screenshot of
something on your screen
and because it's special or somebody's
decided it's special it's collectible
and it's registered on the blockchain
meaning that anybody can check and find
out it's really yours and what the path
of it has been who bought it and who
sold it
but
these nfts can sell for millions of
dollars
case in point
jack dorsey last year a year ago sold
his first tweet
as an nft
so i think he literally
probably just took a screenshot
of the tweet
and sold a screen screenshot of his own
tweet for
2.9 million dollars now i guess he
donated that money
but the person who bought it uh tried to
turn it around for a nifty
profit tried to sell it for 48 million
somebody said
i don't know about that but okay
um so he did not give 48 million so he
bought it for 2.9 million
and at the end of the auction the
highest bid was
280
so he bought it for 2.9 million
and the best bid for selling was at 280
dollars
so if you were thinking of getting into
the nft business to hit it rich
well
i would say look at diversification
don't put all your 2.9 million dollars
into one nft don't do that
well have you heard that elon musk has
offered to buy twitter
as i tweeted this changes everything
do you believe that
now i'm assuming that he succeeds
because there there's certainly some
possibility maybe probability of some
pushback
because the employees at twitter
well they may not all be as delighted
as
potentially you and i are
so there might be some pushback but
let's say he succeeds
would that change everything
is that too big of a claim
because i saw somebody on twitter say
you realize
very few people actually
use twitter
compared to the other social networks
and compared to
anything else
to which i say yes
there are not that many
number of people in the united states
but
here's what you need to
know persuasion wise
now
here's something you don't want to try
at home
dude to draw these uh clever graphs
because
i'm a professional
artist so i can do this and not confuse
you but if you try this at home
could you do you think you could have
pulled this off
no
i'm a syndicated cartoonist i can do
this in my sleep
you're saying to yourself oh i could do
a stick person too
could you
could you
yeah you could do a stick person but
could you do it this well
consider van gogh
if i may digress
the first time you saw a van gogh you
said to yourself
well these lines are all wavy and he's
drawn everything out of perspective
you probably said to yourself
i could probably do that myself
did you ever try
it's harder than it looks isn't it try
to try to draw a masterpiece
yourself see if you can sell it for 40
million dollars like van gogh
no you can't do it so don't think that
art is easy
just because you look at it and say i
could do that you can't
try this at home
right i dare you you can't do that
that's professional work right there
now not just one but
i can do this all day long
right a lot of people would do this
you'd be exhausted you're not a
professional
professionals can do this all day long
all right
that wasn't really the point i was about
to make the point i was about to make
was that twitter is not like other
things whoever whoever has
let's say functional control of twitter
because
it's the thing that journalists are most
influenced by
and journalists tell us collectively
and i'll i'm using journalists as a
proxy for all the opinion makers so that
would include any any pundit anybody
whose voice
changes your belief system
collectively these people are addicted
to twitter
and they can't really go
too much against twitter without
inviting serious pushback
so in my opinion um whereas bezos found
a good publication washington post that
does have a huge impact on what news is
considered news
probably nothing has as much leverage
for the amount he's likely to spend if
if successful
um if twitter becomes more let's say
less biased
which would be the goal less bias you
know more
more useful
content
then these journalists who create the
reality itself in other words our
understanding of reality
is
created by the journalists collectively
and now now twitter
controls the journalists
and maybe
elon musk will control twitter
so what if twitter decides that
their their big thing is going to be
transparency and showing both sides
you know instead of censorship
just make sure that anything
controversial
gets tagged with the
the opposing view
imagine that
it would be pretty radical wouldn't it
and it would it would basically neuter
all of these journalists
in terms of their ability to control the
narrative
because every time they tried it the
counter narrative would be right there
you just see the counter
and
so when i say that elon musk buying
twitter changes everything if successful
we don't know if he'll succeed
um
it could change everything about the way
you see the world
which is your everything
right
um that's your everything
so this is way bigger than you think
uh
did you see the price he's offering uh
54 dollars and 20 cents a
share 5420
5420
is that a coincidence
probably not
[Laughter]
probably not but the thing i was
wondering is was he watching the stock
price
and and adjusting his offer until he
could make those numbers work okay it's
almost it's 419 it's four
make it 420 yeah
publish 420.
it makes me wonder if he was actually
watching to see you know when that was
the right the right thing to bid that he
could also make his other claims about
the percentages that it went up
so
what do you think the insiders at
twitter are doing right now
what do you think the people who run the
algorithm
are
doing besides deleting everything
and sabotaging the company
now
wouldn't it be hilarious
if
hilarious in a terrible way it wouldn't
be hilarious in a good way but in a
terrible way
you could sort of almost imagine the
twitter engineers taking down the whole
company
you're just like deleting the source
code and you know
completely getting rid of all the
databases and stuff
to
to hide whatever they may have wanted to
hide or or possibly for political
reasons
maybe political reasons they just don't
want elon musk to have that much control
over that kind of a platform
so i would really worry about employee
sabotage
wouldn't you
now here's the funny thing
what if elon musk simply wanted to
destroy twitter
what if that's all he wanted
because twitter might destroy itself
just because he offered to buy it
which would be the funniest thing that
ever happened
if he could destroy all of twitter
because he offered to buy it
and then let's say they say no
so say let's say the engineers are
busily like destroying the company from
within
so he doesn't get it at the same time
the
the chair the board is rejecting the
offer
and and if they reject the offer elon
will sell his nine percent
so so you can imagine a case where elon
gets in for nine percent gets out for
you know doesn't lose too much there
on that transaction
destroys the entire company because they
destroy itself to avoid being taken over
it's just gone
now
i don't think i would be laughing about
it because it wouldn't be good for me or
any of you
but
that kind of could happen
again i wouldn't rule it out
right
so
uh one of the things that i somehow i
missed this maybe i saw it before and
don't remember but apparently
when uh some not too long ago elon musk
tweeted that san francisco's homeless
should be moved into twitter's
headquarters
and
the thinking is that twitter had gone
remote
so if it's a remote company and really
the whole thing could be remote you
think
uh
why doesn't twitter headquarters
become the place they has all the
homeless
now
is that not entertaining
is that not entertaining
that's entertaining
um
here's something else entertaining
uh max boot who you might recognize that
name from being a the democrats democrat
he's like the most democrat you could
possibly be max boot
and his response to the story about musk
maybe buying twitter is i am frightened
by the impact on society and politics if
elon musk acquires twitter
he seems to believe that on social media
anything goes
for democracy to survive we need more
content moderation not less
what
can you imagine doing a tweet in which
you call for censorship but you call it
content moderation and you think
you think that's a good look
or that or that the public's going to
say yeah
need more content moderation well
actually probably democrats do
i bet a lot of democrats really did this
and liked it
um but here's what i would add
i wouldn't argue with moderation
i wouldn't argue with moderation so
actually i would agree with the max boot
better moderation would actually be
better
but not censorship
so the better way to do it is to tag any
provocative thing that looks wrong
with a counter argument so that anybody
who sees the wrong thing can somewhat
immediately see the counter-argument
you don't have to know what's wrong
because a lot of us have made
let's say predictions and whatnot this
seemed wrong at one time
that became right later so twitter
doesn't need to decide what's right or
wrong they just show the other argument
that's all
is that too hard
and
and do you think that elon musk doesn't
um
doesn't see that that's the obvious way
to go just put the counter there because
that's the art the solution to free
speech is excesses is the counter
argument
always has been
so if you
if you just put the counter argument
there you're done
it isn't hard
why do we always act like it's hard
this whole free speech argument
literally we just act like it's hard it
couldn't be easier
the whole point of free speech is show
both sides
that's it
the whole thing
and elon musk could easily do that
just make sure there's an easy feature
for attacking a good argument on the
other side that's all
i wouldn't use fact checkers in the
usual way for sure
all right
so here's another little irony that came
out of this
is it irony or am i using that word
wrong you decide
am i using the word irony incorrectly
because it sort of moved into common
usage
to mean just something that's weird and
interesting
and i haven't decided if i'm going to go
with the with a common usage yet
instead of the you know wordplay kind of
original use
but here's a real thing that's happening
would you agree with the following
statements that
the worry about climate change
was a big factor in tesla's success
is that fair to say
that a lot of the people who bought
teslas
and electric cars in general
were probably the people most concerned
about climate change because in some
cases they would even pay a premium
they'd pay a premium for the tesla so it
wasn't about money and it wasn't
necessarily the best looking car you
know there are lots of good cars that
look good
it really i think was about climate
concerns wouldn't you say
it's funny a lot of people on youtube
are saying no
you don't think
i i'm not i'm not saying that everybody
bought one for that reason
there are plenty of people who have
teslas just because they like the
engineering
in fact i somebody said and i agree with
it that originally maybe it was more
about the climate but today it's more
about the good engineering would you
would you buy that would you buy that
originally it was more about
about the climate but now it might be
more about just it's a good car
but either way my point will stand
because the the climate concerns
certainly made tesla successful
and
then elon musk might use his fortunately
made from tesla
that was based largely on climate change
concerns
to
destroy the left's control of the media
which
promoted the narrative of climate
disaster
about
so
did the left
make tesla successful enough that musk
could buy the thing that
made them worry about climate change
and by the way he's a climate change
believer
so he's not on the other side of that
but it's kind of a weird uh
outcome is it irony
is it irony
or is that the wrong word do you go with
the popular usage
or are you classicals
i'm still classical on that word
um i got this idea from uh chase
mcmichael on uh
twitter his version was what's so ironic
well he likes the word is many hard
progressive marxists or tesla owners in
the car
and tesla stocks so they paid for this
it's very serendipitous
all right so um i think sam mcroberts
tweeted a
um a meme
that's based on a elon musk quote from
2021
right
so i'm going to ask for your help
so a number of you have been watching me
for a long time
and i'm going to make a claim that's the
kind of claim
that a lot of you really hate
but i'll do it anyway
because i don't care
and
so here's the quote from elon musk and
then wait for my point about it
and people are calling it elon's law
and apparently he tweeted at one point
last year that the most entertaining
outcome
as seen from an external observer not
the participants is the most likely
the most entertaining outcome is the
most likely
now he said that in 2021
that's called elon's law
have you heard me say that for the last
five years
and
where have you heard it
did i ever write it down
because i'm trying to remember if it's
in my book when when bigly
is it in win bigly have i ever written
it down
yeah
so so those who have been watching me
for a while
if elon said it in 2021 that would be
maybe four years after i first started
saying it
five years after i've been saying it
yeah and i always talk about life
imitating a movie and following the most
the most entertaining outcome and i use
it to predict that's why i talk about a
lot it's a prediction method
so um
do you think that came from me
so that's the part you don't like when i
ask questions like that because
sometimes sometimes it might be true
most time probably not most the time
probably just two people having the same
idea
uh
somebody says heard it from you but i
think you're recording someone else no
no i i definitely made that up
that's definitely for me
but here's the thing
elon could have also come up with it
independently and here's the argument
for that
because he's also a believer that we're
in a simulation
if you believe we live in a simulation
then the next logical question is
why
like what why are we here if we're
simulated who made us and for what
purpose
and one of the obvious purposes could be
entertainment
it's just like a reality show that
somebody watches in a different universe
and so that would that would uh explain
now how often have you heard me say
that i get a plot twist every day
every day again yesterday
there's this one through through story
in my life that i get a plot twist like
a completely unexpected
thing on a left field every single day
one a day
and it just never stops even when i talk
about it it doesn't stop
like you think that talking about it
would make you stop
but it doesn't
here with it yesterday plot twist every
single day
um
so and maybe some of you see that in
your own lives
anyway
so the elon musk story is uh
hilarious
but this thing about the most
entertaining outcomes
and i especially like the fact
that everything about elon offering to
buy twitter is hilarious
there might be somebody watching this
live stream
who knows i can see your fingerprints
and that's all i'm going to say about
this
i can see your fingerprints
so you know the story about the new york
city subway shooter
and i guess there's at least one major
story
that described his i think age and his
height
but not his uh ethnicity
and the story is that he's literally a
black supremacist
uh racist
who who has you know videos and stuff on
social media of him ranting
and
wanting to kill people and
apparently wanting to kill white people
because
because he wanted to kill white people
so
and i was it greg guffeld who was the
first one to say this story is going to
just disappear because it's so
anti-narrative
that one of the odds that when biden is
in office
would be one of the biggest or the
biggest i don't know is it the biggest
mass shooting
so
i i don't i try not to pay attention too
much to mass shootings
but is this the biggest one
under biden
yes or no is it the biggest
mass murder thing under biden
somebody's saying he was a crt trainee
that's a joke right
so what are the odds of that
i mean again
isn't this i hate to say it because
there's nothing entertaining no there's
nothing entertaining about all the
people who got shot
right so if so if we can be on the same
page that the the tragedy has to be
respected for the
for the horrific nature of it
but
it's kind of the most entertaining
outcome
again
is it not
now some of it is because the most
entertaining outcomes are the things
that make it into our consciousness
so you just notice the ones that are
entertaining because that's what you
talk about that's what makes it news
so there are definitely reasons that the
most entertaining outcome is the most
likely now the mechanism that that i
believe
is that if all of us are thinking what
would be the most entertaining outcome i
think it happens
i think it's the
society thinking that that could happen
and it would be entertaining if it did
such as trump winning the presidency
that would be really entertaining if it
happened right and i feel the fact that
it is entertaining drives people toward
that behavior because they want to
create entertainment for themselves even
if they're not thinking about it that
way
we kind of like
now
why
why is somebody at locals continuing to
say crt trainee over and over and over
again
is it he wasn't literally
that right is that just a joke
i don't know what that means all right
so i talk about the value of
diversification all the time
you should diversify your stock
portfolio you should diversify your
bosses if you can in other words have
lots of clients or customers and then
they become your bosses so if one fires
you you still have lots of bosses left
customers
so diversification works in everything
and uh
skills as well if you diversify your
skills
and you do it wisely you can find skills
that work together for your talent stack
now there's here's another category i'm
going to add to this because you see
keep seeing this pattern everywhere
somebody mentioned to me recently
that if you had a job and you belong to
a gym
as a man you're you're a top five
percent eligible male
that's all you need
you've got a good job i'll say good so
you got a good job
and you go to the gym
you're in the top five percent and all
you did is combine two things
now here's the second part of the advice
i give you
the second part of the advice
which i just saw a comment that made me
forget but i'll remember again
uh so here are the things that i would
put together if i were trying to build a
talent stack
uh and i remember my point you should
you should control everything you can
control
that might be the best
advice anybody ever gave you
in that few words
control everything you can control
that's it
if you did that one thing do you know
how successful you'd be
real successful
you just control all the things you can
control so here's some things you can
control
you can control your career
to a large extent by by learning new
skills and applying for new jobs you
know there's there's a pretty well
defined process for improving your job
you have control over that that doesn't
mean you get every promotion
but you definitely have control over
your career how about your fitness your
diet your exercise definitely have
control
very much control over those things
how about your
shoes
well if you have a little bit of
disposable income you do have control
over your footwear
you can completely control your footwear
now here's where i don't follow my own
device
i need to be much better in the footwear
because if you're a man especially
women will judge you by your shoes
so you can wear you know
ratty jeans and a t-shirt but if your
shoes are killing it
women will look at you and say stylish
especially if you're fit
if you're fit
and you have good shoes
you're in good shape
right
so
think about this think about what it is
you want out of life and let's say that
a good social life maybe good love life
or are things you want
just consider that 100 of the things
that really matter
the the ones at the top of the list
they're all the ones you control
they do so even if you were born with
you know not the best
physicality and look
if you get those things right
job fitness
and good shoes
you're
75 there
now other things i would add is you know
learning how to
talk to strangers maybe add some
activities and travel makes you more
interesting ambition always looks good
if your career is not killing it yet
but you have a clear ambition and
something that looks like a plan to get
there
people
will respond to ambition
as a positive positive thing
so build a talent stack
for your social life but control the
hell
out of everything you can control
all right i'm going to give you another
really
um
abusively
what i call it
annoying point so sometimes i follow my
own advice and i've been trying to
upgrade my footwear game
but i should do more with that
um
but with fitness i try to follow my own
advice all right
so
you know
lately i've been working on my bicep
and
this is something i can completely
control right
so i have complete control over my arms
somebody said sense of humor you don't
really have control over that
you can't really control your sense of
humor people if they have one that they
don't so i wouldn't recommend that you
work on your sense of humor
necessarily
by juicing no that's that's literally
just going to the gym like
more and
having a personal trainer which i
recommend
by the way
here's another piece of advice
i exercised all my life without a
personal trainer because i always looked
at what they were doing with clients at
the gym and i thought
it looks like they're just standing next
to the useful machine making them do
something weird why not just use the
machine you're standing right next to it
but when you actually have somebody who
knows what they're doing
work the the muscles that are like the
opposite muscles just
the the the gains that you get in a few
months
when somebody who knows what they're
doing is telling you how to do it
big difference big difference
so that's your other advice today
control everything you can control
here's a question i asked on twitter
would would the nato countries
be better off with putin or no putin so
let's say the two options are putin
leaves office or
he's overthrown in a in a coup or
something would we be better off with
him or without him
because if he stays in office
then the nato countries can degrade
russia forever
economically
and then their military will be more
pathetic than it is they'll still have
nukes but that's okay we don't want them
to fear being attacked and that would
protect them but are we better off just
having russia degraded for i don't know
another 10 years or 15 or 20 however
long putin can stay in there
or would we better be better off if they
immediately replace putin
and then suddenly we don't have a
rationale for
the sanctions
because what if they put in somebody
who's sort of western friendly
what are we going to do keep the
sanctions on
we wouldn't right
we wouldn't
um so which one is better
i don't think we know do we because yeah
we keep talking in terms of you know
putin has to go and you know that's the
right thing to say
but i don't know if we're better off
from a from a military perspective we
might be better off if he stays because
he's ruined russia
as an economic
entity and that should degrade their
military to the point of being
irrelevant
right
i actually don't know and i don't know i
don't know that anybody can know that
so i wouldn't be wishing too hard for
him to leave because you don't don't
know if that's better
big story from the ukraine war is that
um
maybe ukraine used a missile or it could
have been russia says it's some kind of
fire
that maybe happened on its own on their
biggest ship in the black sea the moskva
and it's one of their premier ships a
slava classic cruiser
as i learned from jack bosovic tweets
you should all be following jack bosovic
by the way
and
so what i've learned since yesterday is
that it's the biggest of their ships
that's relevant to the ukraine situation
at the moment they could move assets
but they only had one
only one ship
that was sort of that important in that
area so it looks like probably
ukraine took out their biggest ship
it's being it's being towed back to
russia
how do you think the russian public
feels about their biggest warship
being taken out with one missile
probably
and being
towed back to base
now how much does that degrade their
naval
importance
probably a lot right i've seen two
opinions one not much
because you could just maybe move your
commands in control and i don't know
or replace it or something and then i've
heard other thoughts that is might make
a big big difference it also might
prevent them from moving another big
ship in there because the next one is
going to blow up too
so
yeah it was a 40 year old ship but
probably is central to
the
let's say the coordination efforts i'm
guessing
so i don't know much about the navy and
much about these ships but there's a
possibility that this is a huge
psychological blow
but maybe even militarily
and i just want to i just want to drop
this thought
that sounded crazy before
crazy
have you noticed how quickly things can
turn
where where you said to yourself ah
russia's gonna totally take over a cave
in
in two days
and then suddenly oh
this doesn't look good at all it looks
like it could take forever or not at all
and then suddenly they just pull out
like one day you work you wake up and
russia is just leaving kiev just
like that
so you can you can you can be close to
tipping points really quickly without
noticing them
and
i keep seeing ukraine cleverly you know
knocking out the table legs one at a
time
and i feel as though the russian
military is at it close to a tipping
point
which is not to say that they won't
regroup and just
mow down ukraine and take their time i
guess that's always a good possibility
and the experts a lot of them are saying
that's going to happen
but let's let's just game it out
uh what happens if ukraine just took out
enough of the
military or the the navy the russian
navy
that
that it doesn't work as a supply route
anymore
because you wouldn't have to sink the
navy
to make it useless you just have to show
you could take out their biggest ships
and they'd have to keep some distance
and you'd have to show that if they had
a troop carrier they got near the shore
that it would explode
so you know you know the mines would do
some of that so
is it possible
that ukraine has already won the naval
battle
because remember
things can change quickly
so it's possible
now that those of you who say no i'm not
going to argue with you
right i'm not going to argue so if you
say no this doesn't make any difference
you're probably right
you're probably right the only the only
point i want to make is that we're
really bad
at knowing
when a tipping point is coming
stupid bird
every day
every day this this bird walks in front
of my
one of my security cameras
so i think it's the same bird every day
just one bird
um
so anyway uh what if ukraine manages to
at least blunt the naval force
what if ukraine
now freed from protecting kiev
can consolidate his forces against the
russians in their stronghold
what if
the new uh let's see artillery i guess
and
some helicopters that the united states
and
nato are providing to ukraine
what if these those things go in and
start
making a few good kills
what if ukraine has better command and
control
because they might
what if
taking out the uh russian
navy is part of trapping the russian
army
and not just about the supply chain and
about
about a amphibious landing
what if ukraine is cutting off their
escape
i'm just going to put the thought out
there
that so far zelinski has shown no
interest in small objectives
am i right
when was the last time
that zelinski
thought small
because first there was his successful
entertainment career
and then he ran for a freaking president
of the country
and then he decided that he was going to
take on the one second most powerful
military in the world
and
he's doing okay
right
so those of you who say i'm drinking the
kool-aid you you're not listening
try to listen a little bit better
if i said ukraine is winning and i can
see it from here
that would be drinking the kool-aid
if i say you can't tell when turning
points are near
that is just a statement that you should
listen to because you're a idiot
so if you pay attention a little bit
more to what i said
and stop trolling and criticizing things
you're imagining that hap
they're happening nowhere in the real
world or in this broadcast maybe you
would be useful and not the worthless
piece of that i'm sure your family
thinks about you
um
but i digress
anyway i think with the modern weaponry
that ukraine is getting plus better
coordination
plus better uh
you know motivation
uh better morale
better
everything um
how many of you would say it's
impossible for ukraine to win outright
in the comments
i'm not sure which is the yes or no in
your answers so we'll just see if
there's any any difference
is there
it's not impossible is it
so some people are saying it's
impossible
but
i think the the hidden turning points
always argues for possible not likely
would you like me to put a percentage on
it
i'm gonna go
let's see if we take if we just take
mainstream
uh assumptions
let's say that the news is telling us
accurately what's happening i doubt
that's true but imagine the news is
accurate what would the percentages be i
don't know
80 20 70 maybe 70 80 percent of russia
at least controlling the
eastern part of ukraine
maybe 80
but did you think that ukraine had a a
20 or 30 of winning outright
like a month ago if i said you know i
think ukraine could win all right they
could trap the russian army and just
and just
you know reduce it to ineffectiveness
a month ago you wouldn't have said that
but today you're today when i say well
20 chance
a lot of you are saying you know
20
i can accept twenty percent because it
doesn't change your opinion that russia
will win
it's just that
i think it does introduce a little bit
of doubt doesn't it
um a month ago i said that russia
wouldn't invade by the way every time
you remind me of that in the comments
that is correct
yeah you and and anybody who does what i
do you should remind us of both our
correct and incorrect
predictions but
i always tell you to look at the reason
for the incorrect prediction
because sometimes being incorrect
might be more insightful than being
correct
in this case the reason i said he
wouldn't invade
is that i thought
he couldn't succeed
and it was obvious
now when i
say succeed i don't mean i didn't think
he could ultimately conquer ukraine if
he wanted to put everything into it but
i didn't think it would be easy enough
to be a smart move
so my take was this is obviously a bad
move
so he obviously knows it
so he's obviously bluffing
the part that i might have gotten wrong
if mainstream reporting is correct
is that uh putin didn't know
that it was going to be hard
what do you think do you think that
putin didn't know it was going to be
hard
or do you think that he really just
wanted to control the east
and
the move on the capitol was more of a
diversion if it worked it'd be fine but
he didn't need it you know it was just
part of the the long game to get the
parts he wanted and control them and
then start working on the rest over time
yeah he knew it could be hard
he i i think he had to know it could be
hard
but
it can't be a coincidence that he's
putting his own people in jail
the people who who should have told them
uh that it was gonna not just be hard
but like maybe really really hard
well what do you think of this uh
putin price hike
even the msnbc ran a poll
said that uh
even even on msnbc and even the
democrats just nobody's buying this
putin price hike thing
so people were asked you know what
causes inflation
38 said biden 28 percent said covet
stuff
23 percent said greedy corporations but
only six percent thought the russian
invasion of ukraine in other words putin
price hike had had much to do with the
prices
now
wouldn't you have known this just by
listening to it
let me tell you why the trump
labels work and this doesn't
trump labels work because his labels
call out something that you felt was
true
maybe you didn't notice
so when trump said uh
low energy jeb
you probably weren't thinking jeb was
low energy but the moment he said it you
said well yeah he is i noticed that so
so his nicknames are completely
compatible
with something you've already thought
or you could easily think because as
soon as you hear it you're like oh yeah
when he said uh was it crooked hillary
now when he says crooked hillary he's
mostly talking to his base
who believed she was crooked
so when he adds the clever nickname to
something you already think is true
the clever nickname can be quite active
it can activate
you know your
already held belief
here's what trump doesn't do
he doesn't use this trick to convince
you of something brand new
like that nobody ever thought of
but this putin price hike nobody was
really thinking that
like the public wasn't saying oh this
ukraine situation will raise my gas
prices
even if it does
the public was not there
and since the other explanations for it
were more compelling they weren't going
to get there
so this is a very basic mistake of
persuasion
to think you can change people's minds
at least not in this context you can't
change people's minds
you know a clever nickname doesn't do
that
what it does is reinforces where your
mind already was or could very easily be
because you have no no objection to it
and once it's called out you say yeah i
can see it but let's say you call call
this out it's a putin price price hike
and you never thought of that before
you never thought that it could be
somehow related to russia and then biden
says the putin price hike does that does
that connect to anything you were
already thinking
not at all it just feels like it comes
out of left field
so very basic
persuasion mistake
especially if you're trying to talk to
your base because the base wasn't there
and he couldn't get him there
all right uh ukraine also destroyed some
big russian bridge where a
con russian convoy not wasn't a russian
bridge the convoy in ukraine where the
russians were crossing it
so
here's my big question about this kind
of war
given that ukraine has modern
military equipment
how could a large um
naval ship survive
the modern military stuff how could any
convoy ever get across a bridge
you can't take out every bridge that has
a convoy how does how does anybody get
across a bridge when you've got if
you're it's your home team and you've
got all this modern
weaponry you know they're coming and
you've got you've got advanced notice
yeah i don't know how they ever do it
and and i said before how do russian
tanks
at the beginning of the war even before
i said how are tanks going to survive
modern
defensive weaponry and the answer is not
very well
are you seeing tanks be an important
part of the battle
am i wrong that tanks became irrelevant
i think tanks just became like a metal
coffin
right
so
big war equipment only works against
relatively under
under-tooled opponents if you're up
against anybody who has access to modern
military equipment
all your big stuff blows up on day one
doesn't it
you know imagine china and the united
states getting into a naval
confrontation
both sides would lose all their big
warships on the first day
because you can't really defend anything
like that
against a modern military
and um are you surprised at how easily
ukraine got to the biggest uh russian
ship
weren't you thinking to yourself well
they must have all kinds of you know
defensive
you know screening they can stop any
missile coming in
maybe not
maybe not
maybe they can't stop
right
now are they our navy allegedly has all
these countermeasures and stuff
or do they yeah would they actually work
you know would a would our navy be able
to fight off
two missiles coming from different
directions i don't know
you know maybe nobody can defend
anything big against the modern military
all right um
so
if you haven't seen this yet it's really
worth watching
uh
so brian stelter
had some pollsters on who did this test
where they had a bunch of fox news
viewers
they paid them to watch cnn for 30 days
to see if it changed their views
now
i'm going to pause for a moment while
you fill in your own joke
about how you have to pay people to
watch cnn
do your own joke
okay good you got one good okay
i didn't need to do that one
this is actually just the story
yeah i don't need to add the joke if the
setup is the joke
so
some people had to be paid to watch cnn
for 30 days
and then they were asked questions later
to find out what they knew about certain
topics and sure enough
people who went from fox news to cnn as
brian stelter was quite happy to to show
on his program
they they gained new information about
topics they didn't even know about
so apparently if you if you watch only
fox news you'll miss like entire angles
or stories
that cnn covers and you won't even know
it
so they proved that fox news viewers are
kind of in the dark
about a lot of stuff that cnn
does so that that was uh brian's oh
actually there was a little bit more to
the story
so there were two uh two of the
pollsters they were both on to talk
about it
and the second one pointed out that uh
the
the fox news viewers who only watched
cnn for a month
didn't learn anything about the abraham
of course
the abraham accords like one of the
biggest stories of all time you know
like a major peace deal in the middle
east but if you watch cnn you didn't
hear about it because it was a huge
trump success
so watching uh and then stealthers like
trying to keep the smile as he's being
chewed apart
by this pollster who's just being polite
he's just saying well
here's a graph that shows that if you
watch cnn for a month you completely
missed one of the biggest stories in the
world the abraham accords
and then what did brian stelter say
he blamed him he blamed the pollster of
both both siderism
i think that's the word to use
both siderism oh
oh so now
you're doing the both sides thing
no
that wasn't both ciderism
that was the study
that was the study
there's no bull ciderism he just proved
that if you watch one network you get
half the news and if you watch the other
network you get the other half that's
about it
which we sort of already knew but it was
hilarious to watch uh
it looked like stelter was just learning
that he had a guest on that was going to
show that you don't learn about the
biggest story in the world if you watch
cnn
and the guy who is who is explaining it
to him he was so sheepish about doing it
because he knew he was destroying cnn
right in front of the stalter he's like
well
you have to see his mannerism he's so
polite he's like well
you know actually
what we did find
you know sort of
i'm just laughing the whole time about
watching this guy try to navigate that
well msnbc is failing hard
and in a hilarious way the only thing
good they had going for him was the
rachel maddow show and then she took a
big
hiatus or time off and but then she's
coming back but for her reported
30 million annual fee she's only going
to do uh
one night a week on monday
i don't even think monday is a good
night for tv is it
maybe it is i don't know
um
so i don't know if she gets to keep her
whole 30 million dollars for just
showing up one day a week but i like
that gig it does show you how just
desperate msnbc is
that even this is being considered
but apparently a number of their prime
time shows
bring in
around 100 000 viewers
100 000
do you know how many people watch this
live stream
about about
50 000 you know if you count recorded
playbacks
so
for the price of an ipad
literally for the price of an ipad
i run a network
that is 50 as good as msnbc
so you're welcome i guess
now to be fair i think everybody who
looks at these ratings is uh
is missing the the business model
i don't think that msnbc or cnn
are designed for live viewers
i think that they're designed for
creating clips
and then the eclipse of the live viewing
goes around and that's actually the news
so if you go to msnbc's or cnn's website
there are all kinds of links to their
video content
the video content comes from their live
stuff
and really it's just about
commercializing the replays i think
so
thank you bill because i know some of
you who have some business experience
we're squirming when i talk about live
ratings because it's really not their
business model at all
they're really not about the live show
and neither am i all right because did
you see what i did i compared my
replay numbers of 50 000
to their live numbers of 100 000 and
that wasn't that wasn't the right
comparison their their replays are
probably in the millions and my replays
are fifty thousand
so there's not come it's not comparable
but you can make it sound that way
tim pool is bigger than cnn but again
on the replay i don't know
i don't know
so that
ladies and gentlemen
completes the best live stream
of all humanity
msnbc is subsidized by the cia somebody
says
well i don't know about all that
but there does seem to be a cia
connection to our media
and
who was saying that cnn
can't even get viewers during a war
so you the ukrainian situation is a
major world war one that you know we
have great
interest in
and
uh wow
uh so even fox news has a toad venom
psychedelic experience story that was on
jesse waters interesting everybody's
talking about the psychedelic
experiences now
what you don't like my tirades
all right let's take a vote
how many of you like to see me go off on
trolls
go
should i keep doing it
or should i let them ride
i've got a feeling that
yeah the the loca
the locals uh people like it
all right well there there's some
disagreement but it seems to be that uh
the people who are responding
now
those of you who don't like it
is it because it triggers you for
something in your personal life
or just not entertaining
probably a little both
how's my tennis game i don't play tennis
anymore i quit
because it was bad for my body
all right and that's all for now and i
will talk to you later on youtube
thanks for watching
