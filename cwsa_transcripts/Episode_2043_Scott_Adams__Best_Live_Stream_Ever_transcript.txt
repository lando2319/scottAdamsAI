Papa
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization the
best live stream you're about to ever
see
yeah this will be the one you're talking
about for I don't know minutes and if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that can only be understood by
meth addicts
that all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass of tank or Chelsea Steiner canteen
Joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine into the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous hip
yeah that's pretty good I could feel the
simultaneity
it was especially
crisp today well I got so many stories I
don't know where to begin I'll just go
all of them
um I have been doing affirmations to try
to solve the the drought in California
and I see this map I don't know if you
can see it but there's all these green
flashing things like a real bunch of
energy that's coming in
and I don't know if you can tell but
that's heading exactly to my house
see my house is right there
and this green energy is heading right
toward it
now
this would only be the second time this
week that I've attracted more energy
than I expected to me
that's probably a coincidence
anyway it's called an atmospheric River
and it's coming hard it looks like the
drought in California is going to get a
little relief
until the forest fires
all right uh last night on guffeld how
many of you saw Russell Brand
on Gutfeld that was a lot of fun
probably my favorite show so far my
favorite got the old episode so far
um I love the fact
I love the fact that guffel is a number
one show so he can get he can get the
best guess now he had you know Vivek
ramaswami on the other day and Russell
Brandon and that's so much fun watching
watching all these people come into a
let's say a
an unstructured
sort of chaotic funny environment like
everybody everybody has to be in a
different character then it's really fun
to watch
one of the things Russell Brand has said
he I don't think he said it on on
Garfield last night but he said it
somewhere else he said the thing they
fear most is people with different
political perspectives coming together
I guess today would be the uni party you
know the people in power
that does feel right doesn't it
does feel right because if
people who were on opposite sides of
things came together
you get a lot done there's some system I
forget what country it was where most of
the government decisions are by
referendum
even the the big Federal ones
does anybody remember what system that
is
is it a Swiss the Swiss there might be
other systems like that as well but
doesn't that make more sense to you
because we have this weird situation in
America where there are issues that are
overwhelmingly popular let's say 60 to
40 that's pretty overwhelming
and if sixty percent of the public wants
something
and they understand it well enough to
know what they're asking for it doesn't
make any sense that that has to go
through Congress we should just vote on
it like okay sixty percent of you want
that let's do it now I can imagine that
maybe you don't go with the referendum
if it's close
because then maybe you want your experts
in Congress to you know tell you what
you missed or something but if it's 60
40
and we understand the issue
I think we ought to just do an end run
around Congress I don't know any way to
fix this system that's Constitutional
Amendment probably so impractical
all right here's your media lesson in
how to interpret uh or actually spot
fake news all right so you may have seen
the clip of Representative Goldman
who is talking to Matt taibi and Michael
schellenberger I think at a
congressional event and he said quote
even with Twitter you cannot find
evidence of any direct government
censorship of any lawful speech and why
I say lawful I mean non-criminal speech
did you catch the weasel word
I read it again remember there's only
one word in the whole sentence that's
the weasel word that changes its meaning
okay you found it direct the word is
direct right I'll read it again even
with Twitter you cannot find evidence of
any direct government censorship
if I hadn't called out the word Direct
and you're just sort of casually
listening wouldn't you assume that the
government never tried to to get
anything censored at Twitter
because they never directly did it
all they did was continuously ask
Twitter to do it
but once you've asked Twitter to do it
it's not Direct
it's not Direct
because Twitter's doing it
so
so like what are you even talking about
all we did is
put some kind of soft continuous
persuasive pressure on them by sending
the FBI in to talk to them and you know
when people when the FBI comes in people
just say I'm not going to do what you're
what you say just because you're the FBI
that's the way normal people work isn't
it in a corporation so of course there
was no coercion or or influence because
they didn't ask directly
that's the best we have in Congress
right he's one of the best that's why
that's why this guy got to talk
he got to talk because he's one of the
good ones like hey hey let's let's send
representative Goldman to talk he's got
some weasel words that you've never even
heard
all right
um
Equity is for losers
literally
you know uh Black America it seems and a
lot of their allies are pushing for this
thing called equity
Equity of outcomes
and I say to myself hypothetically if
you divided a bunch of young people of
any any colors or ethnicities you just
randomly divide them into two groups you
say all right group one
we're going to have you focus on equity
we want something like you know similar
outcomes for people so organize your
life
toward being mediocre
try if you work really hard I think we
can get you up to average
all right so that's one group but you'll
also be dragged by systemic racism and
the the ghosts of the past
but if you can work through all that
the system will help you get up to
average you can be medium too
now the other group be they white or
black or Asian Americans whatever
you say them all right here's the deal
we're going to teach you how to focus on
the future
build a talent stack and we're going to
try to get you to excel
you're the ones who are going to have
the tools of success and you're going to
use these tools to be better better than
people who don't know how to do it
you're going to go as high as you could
possibly go not everyone will reach the
top of course but you're going to
outperform ordinary people who don't
know how to do this kind of thing
all right then check back in a few years
um which group is doing better
well what if you get what you try to get
the people who wanted Equity achieved
mediocrity just like they wanted
the people who are learning to excel
probably beat the average on average
who was happier
all right Equity is for losers every
time you hear Equity you should say you
know why are you shooting low why would
you shoot for medium
why would why wouldn't you shoot for a
Black America Americans excelling beyond
the average of other groups is that
racist
would it be racist to say look black
Americans
if you you learn these tools of success
and the rest of the world doesn't or at
least any more than they already are
you can beat them
right you're already beating them in
sports
fashion music
you can beat them at everything if you
use the right strategy it's just a
strategy
uh I think that would work but Equity is
for losers that's like shooting for the
middle
all right um
and hypothetically if I let this is sort
of impossible in the real world but
imagine if I specifically
could train a generation of black
Americans young black Americans
the tools of success you know systems
over goals and don't get hung up on
passion and how to calculate the odds
and how to persuade people you know just
all the tools of success how to
negotiate how to handle money you know
basic stuff
if I did that for let's say five years
or let's say I educated a generation I
just I did it every day
how long would it take for black
Americans to
surpass the performance economically
economically how long would it take for
the black Americans I trained
to surpass white Americans especially
who did not have the same training
right because poor white Americans also
don't hear the tools for Success it's
something that high income people are
more likely to be around
I think you'll take one generation
yourself to wait a generation some
people said five to ten years that might
not be wrong that might not be wrong
but you know the the big uh drag on
black America's education so that's got
to be job one
um
so Biden uh is such a lying guy that
nobody can tell if he's got Dementia or
he's just making up stuff
so he actually says in public that quote
Mega Republicans are calling for
defunding the police
bag of Republicans are calling for
defunding the police
the president of the United States Joe
Biden said that in public
and didn't seem to think he needed to
correct it
because it's literally the opposite of
reality
do you think that's a lie or that he
actually can't he can't discern reality
anymore
because it doesn't look like a lie
anyone would tell
does it
I mean yeah maybe it's just projection
maybe they project so much it's just
automatic even even ridiculous
projection I actually don't know on this
one I can't tell lying or dementia let's
take a vote lying or dementia go
is he lying he knows it or is it just
dementia
if it's both then he doesn't know it
but I'm saying does the dementia cause
it I'm not saying he has dementia but he
knows enough to lie
yeah both
yeah he he could have both but the cause
of this specific lie isn't both it's one
or the other
I think well maybe it could be both I
don't know anyway that's our mystery of
the day all right I found the best tweet
ever about January 6.
this comes from John Thompson who tweets
this January 6 2021 a day that will live
in hyperbole
I'm just gonna let that sit there for a
minute
a day that will live in hyperbole
that's just like such a keeper isn't it
they as soon as you hear that like okay
I'm gonna use that that's a keeper
it's a day that will live in hyperbole
you don't you want Tucker Carlson to say
that
tell me don't you want Tucker to do a
monologue and say we're talking about
January 6 2021 a day that will live in
hyperbole so
yeah I don't I don't think John Thompson
would mind if his joke got stolen
I'm giving him I'm giving him credit
here but people would recognize that if
if somebody used this joke
it's a good joke well constructed
uh there were two stories in the news
today about hot grandmothers are you
noticing that there's a lot more stories
about literally grandmothers who are
unusually attractive
one of them is uh
um model Polina porzukova or whatever
she's like 58 I think and she did a
shoot where she looks like 19 you know
from let's say the neck down she looks
19. I I don't know what kind now now I'm
talking about well I don't know if
cosmetic surgery but her even her torso
you know looks like it's 19 years old so
I don't know how you do that probably
some probably a little bit of work a
little bit of work but now uh
representative bobert
is gonna have a kid
she doesn't or a grandkid she does not
look old enough to have a grandkid but I
think she started early
oh they're they're like the whole idea
of a grandparent like it doesn't look
the same anymore does it she's 36 so be
soon yeah I knew a 36 year old grabbing
them
I've actually not a few of them I've
known a few 36 year old grandmothers
well here's the biggest news that you
won't understand because nobody could
gpt4 is about to come out
in maybe a few weeks and reportedly it
will have multimodal flavors I saw in
one tweet in other words it will do
video
just think about that gpt4 will be the
AI upgrade from gpt3 that is blowing
everybody's mind
my understanding is that version 4 won't
be just a little bit better
is that what you're hearing it's not
like oh this is going to be 25 better or
something like that I feel like it's
it's like a 10x or 100x right
it's like 10 or 100 times more powerful
and the one we have is scary
now now make it I don't know what the
number is but make it way way more
powerful
and then give it video
which it can manipulate to look like
photorealistic things
you can make a movie by talking into it
I think
I mean we'll wait but I believe that I
could take my book God's debris
and just read it
or it already knows it because the book
has been available for free on the
internet for years so you might have
seen it because it's just there on the
internet so if it read everything in the
internet maybe it read it so I could
just say hey have you read God's debris
and then gpt4 says yes I am familiar
with it then I say can you make me a
movie that will correspond to the scenes
and then have the characters speak the
dialogue
Boop there it is
I believe I can create a movie in 10
seconds
I think that's going to be and if it's
not this version and if it's not gpt4 it
might be you know two separate uh
you know pieces of AI that you have to
use but if you put the two of them
together
I think you're going to make movies by
just saying read this book and make a
movie out of it I think that's real or
read the script
so and we have no idea what's coming I
saw a demonstration today
Chris France tweeted this about another
AI called mid-journey
and he showed four photographs and asked
you if you could tell which of the four
was the real one and which were
generated by AI now it was a trick they
were all generated by AI they looked
perfect
I think one of the characters at four
figures but if you didn't look closely
you wouldn't notice it it's sort of
realistic now
all right so the days of being able to
know that what you're looking at is real
are absolutely gone
from this point on and really earlier
if you believe that something's true
because you saw a video or a photograph
it actually means nothing now it means
nothing
because the The Fakes will look just
like the real
um speaking of that there's a video on
the internet of a Russian helicopter
photographing a UFO well that flew you
know near and around it
now would you be surprised to know that
the photography is not really clear
interesting huh because the apparently
the Russian aircraft was at the same
speed as the UFO it was like flying
right next to it if you fly right next
to something and you take out your
smartphone and go click
and you're traveling at the same speed
so it's as if you're not moving at all
wouldn't you get a pretty good picture
no don't you think you could get at
least one good clear picture and there
is video
video especially like at least some
point event should be in Focus but now
but no somehow it's not clear
and here's the funniest thing
it's shaped like a like a flying disc
I'll pay a flying disc that's a little
too on the nose
flying disc from Russia sorry Russia
nice try
but we're not buying that UFO
all right
um here's more evidence that I might be
sensationally right about something that
you believe I'm sensationally wrong
about
and before we talk about Ukraine I'll
give my
uh disclaimer no I don't believe any
reporting about Ukraine no I don't
believe the narrative that Ukraine is
about to win it looks like it sometimes
sometimes it looks the other way but no
you can't tell who's going to win you
can't tell how it's going to go so the
next thing I say is Under the Umbrella
of we don't know what's going on over
there it's just something fun to talk
about
I say it twice
because sometimes you don't hear it the
first time that's why
um so here's a new reporting from CNN
the Wagner group is complaining
viciously that they can't even get a
phone call through to the Kremlin
because they keep asking for ammo
because they're running out of ammo the
most important fighting group the Wagner
group and Russia is not even answering
their calls anymore at the same time the
Russian army says hey they're giving all
of our ammo to the Wagner group now
CNN's reporting had the actual soldiers
from Russia saying they don't have ammo
the Wagner group is getting it they have
the head of the Wagner group his own
quotes publicly saying that he can't get
any ammo because it's going somewhere
now with those two stories together
would you conclude that Russia is
running out of ammo yes or no
given that we can't believe anything
can't believe anything but when you
conclude the running out of ammo
yeah I would say
it's too soon wouldn't you agree too
soon
I think it's too soon because first of
all all the reporting is
hard to believe but also there could be
a strategic reason they could be
stockpiling it for a big push
that's possible and this isn't yet the
big push they could be withholding it so
the Wagner group doesn't go further
right they might want their army to just
be holding until they're ready for like
a really big push
but if you add it with yesterday's story
that they were using their so-called
best missiles and lots of them
that kind of suggests the running out of
regular stuff
is sort of I mean it not necessarily
but at this point all signs are pointing
pointing toward running out of ammo
now as I've told you before
you don't have to get to zero Mo before
everything falls apart am I right
you don't get you don't have to run out
before everything falls apart you just
have to be not enough
and then you're gonna you're gonna
Retreat instead of fight because you
don't have enough if you don't have
enough ammo the smartest thing to do is
Retreat right am I wrong about that you
know if you don't have any other kind of
Advantage you because you you want to
wait until you have ammo
so you preserve your forces wait to have
ammo and then make another push so
I believe you could have a complete
systems failure with just an ammo
shortage not running out
and I don't know what that shortage is
it could be not much it could imagine if
ten percent of your forces didn't have
ammo
or or everybody had Mo but nobody had
enough
right to like get through a conflict you
the degree that you would have to
restrict the ammo
probably is not as much as you think
before the whole thing falls apart
now remember my other uh conspiracy
theory hypothesis you should put no
weight behind this idea because it's
purely speculative
my belief is that the Wagner group head
is getting too important
and he has to be taken out by Putin and
the best way to take him out is to let
him die or let his forces get degraded
before Putin negotiates for peace
because the last thing he wants is this
souped-up fully armed Wagner group to be
sort of repatriated from the war into
the country and now there's like a
standing army that doesn't report to
Putin you know not directly
and they might be pissed at the Russian
government for who knows what everything
basically so I think I think Putin might
need to have to take the Wagner group
out before he can negotiate peace
so I think he's grinding up the Wagner
group so it looks like Russia has an
offense but making sure they don't win
too hard
because that's not even going to help
him you know winning a little extra
isn't going to help him a lot because I
think he wants to negotiate his way out
so speculation
speculation I I wouldn't put a bet on it
but it looks to me like uh there's two
things going on they're literally
running out of ammo but on top of that
not running out but they're running low
and then on top of that
I think Putin's trying to take the
Wagner group out because he has to
I'll just put that out there for fun see
what happens
um
here's a here's a spotting of systems
being better than goals out in the wild
so
um
I saw a tweet from a Twitter user Brent
aurel who said the most dangerous career
move anyone can make is pursuing
Education and Training strictly on the
basis of an economic future that is
unknowable and therefore almost
completely imaginary
what do you think given that the future
is you know super unpredictable at the
moment
should you get educated
because your education you don't know if
it'll be useful
well
um
a
a writer who does some articles for the
Washington examiner and books and stuff
Tim Carney said this he said amateurs
amateurs think Chess Masters are
planning eight moves ahead Chess Masters
know that's impossible they are thinking
about two moves ahead and asking quote
how can I put myself in the best
position for whatever the heck might
come my way
now you recognize that as systems
thinking right
a system is you don't know where it's
going to end up but you know if you put
this this piece in this part of the
board it will sort of control an area
so so the chess player is playing a
system you know obviously there's a goal
of winning the game but that's trivial I
mean it's obvious uh but the system is
not to plan eight and Advance the the
system is to control territory and you
know that sort of thing
um so what about that in your life
so this is this is what I tell you is
that you should develop a talent stack
that can give you all kinds of options
right you you want to develop the kinds
of skills that would work in every
environment for example
good communication will work in every
environment
being good at dealing with people and
negotiating probably working 90 percent
of environments
yeah so there are a whole bunch of
things that work in any environment
and so you want a system
to be as flexible as possible not a
system that prepares you for exactly one
thing
although if you're learning to be a
doctor that probably makes sense
here there's a Wall Street Journal had a
really interesting article of something
I never would have thought about that
China is having a cousin and uncle
shortage
is that weird
So In traditional Chinese culture you
got big families and the family is your
your support structure you know more so
than even the government so if you get a
this big extended family one of the
advantages is you're more mobile
because for example when I when I moved
to California
I probably would not have except my
brother was already here
so if you have a if you have a family
member who's already in America for
example
it's a lot easier to move to America
right just just having that family
structure but because of the population
uh bomb that's happening in China where
there's just fewer and fewer babies
families are also getting smaller
not only do you have fewer babies or no
babies but your cousin didn't have a
baby either so now your family support
structure is shrinking and that would
have in theory an enormous impact on
China's resilience and economy
which is I've never thought of that the
only reason I bring it up is that it's
one of those things that could be a big
thing that I've literally never thought
about
but it also could give salt easily by
you know workarounds Etc
so just keep an eye on that
all right
uh the Academy Awards has hired a crisis
team
to keep Chris Rock from getting slapped
again I guess no not Chris Rock but just
keep keep any trouble
now here's where our system goes wrong
every time
all right so Chris Rock gets slapped
one time in the history of anything
there was a problem one time
but you're the Academy Awards can you
act as if you're not going to do
anything about it now I guess they you
know maybe kicked uh Will Smith out of
their Academy or something or he quit I
don't know so they could do something
like little symbolic things
but it feels like if you're in charge
you've got to like show you're doing
something like something physical or
you're making a change so imagine some
group comes in and pitches to the
Academy Award people hey
you had a problem uh this is bad PR
because people think my God you haven't
done anything about it you could hire my
company
and we'll put in this crisis management
team and they'll be basically guarding
people from getting on stage
right just guarding people
so
what happens is how can the Academy
Awards say no
to somebody offering physical guards to
solve the problem that maybe people
think is a real problem but really just
happened once
so as soon as this this stuff starts
getting monetized all right then this
this company is the crisis group for
just the Academy Awards do you think
that group would say hey let's talk to
the Golden Globes people they have the
same problem of course they would right
then pretty soon every event would have
to hire a crisis Management Group
the the way our free market works is
amazing and stupid at the same time
because people will sell whatever
anybody can buy and sometimes what
people want to buy is completely
irrational
so keep in mind when you're seeing you
know things like ESG and CRT and Dei
there's somebody like this hypothetical
crisis Management Group who's selling a
package of services and that's why it's
a thing it's not a thing because a whole
bunch of people thought it was a good
idea even though they did even though
they did it's a thing because somebody's
selling it
and as soon as somebody's selling it and
then it becomes a fixture of our reality
then everything's distorted and terrible
so it's just an example of how once we
monetize hate you get more hate
there's no way around it so with social
media monetizes hate because you get
more clicks for hate
now uh yeah so you're gonna get what you
what you monetize
I'm having a feeling that all of the
human society needs to be re-engineered
like almost start start from scratch
now I would agree with you that you know
the classic family structure would be
the best but I don't see any way to
force people into it or even incentivize
them you know you could change the
financial incentives but I feel like the
the horse has left the barn
meaning
people just don't want to be married in
large numbers they just don't want it
and I kind of understand
yeah I tried it a few times like I get
it I get it
but here's some indications that all of
society is falling apart right teens who
meet up with their friends I saw this
Rex Woodbury tweeted it teens who meet
up with their friends almost every day
is down from 50 percent in the 90s to 25
percent today
that's a crisis
half of teens used to hang out with
friends every day now it's only 25
percent
human contact
Keeps Us healthy
this is a Health crisis and then you add
that Mental Health crisis the fentanyl
crisis your kids are have more than ever
I think
and of course this this effect happened
at the same time that smartphones were
introduced of course
um
and then the other things that
smartphones have caused I want to see if
this is a a gender
um
say is this a gender reality or a gender
sexism
sexism a reality here's your am I sexist
or reality
true or false
if a husband texts his wife
and she does not respond for a few hours
he might not like it but it wouldn't be
a problem
am I right you wouldn't like it but it
wouldn't be a problem
if the woman texts if the if the wife
texts the husband and he doesn't respond
in 15 minutes
is it a fight
probably
see even even the most basic
interactions of male and female now some
of you are disagreeing but it's sort of
a thing I think we've all noticed
even the basic interactions between men
and women is being ruined by phones
I I can't I can't walk into another room
without my phone without worrying that
somebody's going to call in in an
emergency I don't know what kind of
calls you get
but if I get a call
it's somebody who's standing in line
somewhere and they need an immediate
answer because they're actually in line
and if they get to the front of the line
and it's only two people they can't do
the thing that they wanted to do and
you'll be sorry
like all all of my calls are an
emergency
I've got somebody standing here right
now uh and I can't do the thing or your
your roof is leaking I mean it's all
it's all emergencies so I never can get
a minute away from my phone but I don't
think it works the other way
all right uh
I'm going to give you a different filter
on the world economic forum that I call
the Dilbert filter
there's a filter which is the the world
economic Forum wants to you know change
the great reset and change everything
and let's say that that's a valid Theory
let's say that's a theory I'm going to
offer you a second explanation and I
want you to compare it to your current
thinking about the Wes master plan to
change the economy and take away all
your stuff
so this comes from Naomi Klein and it
was in The Intercept in 2020 I hadn't
seen it until now
but she says
I'll just read one of her sentences
great reset is not a serious effort to
actually solve the crises it describes
on the contrary is it an attempt to
create a plausible impression that the
huge winners in this system in other
words rich people are on the verge of
voluntarily setting greed aside
to get serious about solving the Raging
crises that are radically destabilizing
our world
I'm sorry I don't care what any of you
believe about the world economic Forum
once you see this Frame it's so obvious
that's what's happening no of course
they don't mean any of this stuff of
course they don't beat it
the whole thing is to make you think
they mean it they don't do anything
all they do is bring all the rich people
together and say you know these rich
people don't even want to make money
they don't even care about money let me
tell you the rich people in this room
these are the ones who want to solve
climate change for you no matter how
much it costs them even if they have to
give up their Maseratis they're going to
work for your benefit
by joining a meeting and talking
and you might say but
what have they changed
to which I say well they certainly have
proposed things I know but like what's
actually happened well have you seen the
ten point plan I know but
it was actually different because of the
world economic fit well have you noticed
that the things are recommending are
part of the trend
yeah but that doesn't mean they did
anything
uh this is my current belief about the
world economic Forum it's a Dilbert
situation
where rich people are just covering
their asses and creating this basically
the effectively it's a human PowerPoint
presentation that says they're doing the
right things but they're not doing the
right things
they're not doing the right things
the other possibility is that they mean
all this crazy that you think
they really mean
I'm sorry if you believe that they
believe a plan to do any of that crazy
 that you've heard about
it's all signaling
that's my current belief now that
doesn't mean that's what they're
thinking
just to be clear that doesn't mean that
you know when JB Diamond goes there or
whoever it doesn't mean he's thinking
all right I gotta go do the theater none
of this is going to happen I don't want
it to happen I'm just going to go do the
theater I doubt it's that simple
it's just everybody knowing what's in
their interest
this is the George Carlin explanation
you don't need a conspiracy when
everyone knows what they need to do
they all they all know what they need to
do they the world economic Forum doesn't
invite stupid people unless they're
celebrities am I right
so it's basically brilliant business
people and leaders and idiots
celebrities so that you'll think oh they
really they agree with those celebrities
it looks like it's a whole bunch of
people that even celebrities
are on board with us I think all the
rich people are like oh cool we get to
go someplace and meet some celebrities
and and get out of town and go skiing
and and when we get back we can say
we're working on the big problems of
reality when nothing like that is
happening
it's kind of brilliant
all right
um
I I I watched in horror as
representative Sylvia Garcia Democrat
from Texas
um try to embarrass Matt taibi and then
Michael schellenberger at this
Congressional hearing and I'm not even
going to give you the details of the
ridiculous questions she asked I'm just
going to tell you that I've never seen
two people react
in the more perfectly
to that level of
the normal way to react when somebody
said to you you're in public and you're
being grilled is you either get the the
button-down approach like yes
representative I understand what you're
saying but uh you know my my reasoning
is this
all right and that's never really good
because it's just somebody acting
reasonable and then somebody's slapping
them over and over again
the other way is to react angrily no no
you're lying we did not say that or that
did not happen or you're exaggerating
right and those that can make you look
bad too I mean you could win that way
but it gives you die but what what taibi
and uh and shellenberger did
was the just the best they just couldn't
keep the smiles off their face which was
clearly signaling oh my God you
see this too right
right the look on their face was to the
audience you see this too don't you
oh it was perfect it was just perfect
now I don't think they planned that I
think it was just spontaneous I think
they were actually amused like they
didn't look like they were acting I
think they were about to break out
laughing because the the Democrat was
looking so stupid at that moment so that
was kind of perfect
all right
um I I loved watching Anderson Cooper
interview uh Adam Schiff so he had the
three faces on screen and the three
boxes so Adam Schiff was on the left and
Anderson Cooper in the middle
interviewing and Adam kinsinger was
there
and
uh Adam Schiff was trying to
see I can't even I can't even talk about
Adam Schiff without laughing because
it's now it's just so not serious
anymore
like Adam Schiff is just like the worst
and Watergate guy you know once you've
ascended to Pure comedy so he gets on
there and he says that uh Tucker Carlson
is trying to Gaslight the country by
showing actual footage of what happened
and now I get it that that video footage
could be misleading as was the the
January 6 video footage but it's a
little disingenuous to be complaining
that the very thing you just did
is being done by the other side like we
don't notice like nobody noticed that
the entire context is that Tucker
Carlson only has that video because you
did this thing
in front of the world in the biggest
possible way which is
distorting the the story by selective
edits and and the the balls of this guy
to accuse the other side of what he's
literally the most famous practitioner
of
is
it's just like a comedy act now some of
you say he's he's projecting you know
the the Tucker Carlson thing they always
they always blame you of the thing
they're doing but it's a perfect example
now what I loved about the story is not
what uh Schiff said is Anderson Cooper's
face as he as he listens uh to
to shift essentially defending CNN at
the same time not intentionally but keep
in mind that CNN had reported the
January 6 event like it was real
think about that CNN cover at the
January 6th gen you know the the
committee like it was all real
and now it's very clear that the thing
was closer to a hoax
you know which I've said from the
beginning so CNN really can't hide from
the fact that they covered the story as
real and it's now pretty obvious
some portion of it was just pure hoax
would you agree with that do you agree
with that statement
that is now obvious that the January 6th
committee was just an operation
and they they reported it as real the
entire time now isn't that embarrassing
to hear them
all right is that the yeah I would think
that's embarrassing so Anderson Cooper's
in the middle and uh what I tweeted was
I can't read minds by Anderson Cooper's
face suggests he's not pleased with the
Liars that turn CNN into the dumbest fly
on turd Mountain
and the only reason I'm telling you this
story is that I'm so proud of that
phrase
the dumbest fly on turd Mountain
I welcome you to borrow it
and I'm going to give you full copyright
to that phrase and here's the best part
don't give me credit if you use it
right like if you're talking to your
relatives or something you know they
don't follow just just act like you made
that one up
you you have my approval to attribute it
to your own
good thinking right it's yours I release
it to you
just say there that but but you have to
sell it you gotta you gotta sell like
you just came up with I said I tell you
and Adam Chef
he's making CNN look like that dumbest
fly on turd Mountain
and try to sell it like it's always been
a saying
yeah try to make it look like oh you
haven't heard that one oh yeah it's yeah
you don't want to be the dumbest fly on
turd Mountain my grandfather used to say
that not really but you can tell people
yeah you don't want to die in turret
Hill
[Laughter]
well there's an upgrade you know how
people always say don't die on that Hill
I think it's more effective you say well
if I were you I wouldn't die on turd
Hill
then I saw uh Adam Schiff uh appearing
on MSC and the msnb show with Lawrence
Lawrence whatever his name is he's got
his own show I remember he doesn't like
hammering Lauren somebody
um and then and the chef was saying that
uh Fox News is only acting because they
care about the money and the ratings
so he was on MSNBC whose ratings are in
the toilet
reminding them that they shouldn't care
so much about ratings
has any Democrat ever given good advice
do not get your economic advice from a
Democrat So Adam Schiff telling you know
a struggling network with falling
ratings that they shouldn't worry so
much about the ratings and the money
oh no you know you know what you know
what MSNBC should be struggling for
equity Equity yeah yeah I think CNN and
MSNBC
they should be trying to achieve equity
in the news business well Fox News is
trying to be the best in the business
and we'll lap them and Destroy them
but
hey equity
um
and uh the only reason I bring that up
is to make fun of the fact that I don't
know who Lawrence Lawrence O'Donnell
okay I didn't know his name that was
really my main point
uh
oh yeah and Chef is trying to get
advertisers to stop advertising on Fox
News
the only people who advertise on Fox
News are pharmaceutical companies and
 that got canceled
and and some charity stuff yeah usually
something about veterans
like could Fox News have any fewer
advertisement options than they have
yeah they've got canceled my pillow guy
bunch of pharmaceuticals that maybe they
shouldn't have
although I haven't seen as many lately I
haven't seen as many pharmaceutical ads
and maybe maybe there's a reason for
that uh
yeah Saint Jude's
so so it's either
charity or somebody canceled
it's not like Fox News has a lot of
options
all right uh
uh this might feel like a repeat but uh
it looks like Trump's about to be
indicted
ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha
should I even read this story
all right this is the best one yet
so this is in the uh the genre of the
walls are closing in we got it this time
we got him this time yeah finally and
let me describe how the news tries to
deal with this as a real story
right they wouldn't they want to sell
this as something that's real
uh so all right so what's happening is
that New York I guess Manhattan
prosecutor Attorney Alvin Bragg
um he's notifying attorneys I heard this
in the New York Post that uh the that
the commander the ex-commander-in-chief
Trump is going to be asked to defend
himself in front of a grand jury hearing
now people in the know say that if
you're asked to defend yourself in front
of a grand jury it's indication that
it's sort of the last step before they
indict
so there's the signal is very clear that
the intention is to indict
so how strong is this claim let's see it
involves Stormy Daniels payments
they think Trump will decline the offer
um
and it it's unclear What charges brag
intends to bring against Trump but the
report notices from the New York Post
the report notes that prosecutors could
accuse the former president of
falsifying business records
that'll put him away forever won't it
falsifying some not some business
records not tax records
but just some business records
falsifying some business records and
then they could here's the good part
they could Elevate that charge to a
felony
because otherwise you know it's not
going to keep them out of office or
anything but they get elevated to a
felony by arguing that it was attached
to a second crime
what
so apparently
if you do something that's not too
important but they can attach it to
another thing that's not important the
two of the things that are not that
important
can be conflated into a felony charge
they are literally coming up with
imaginary crimes
that is an imaginary crime
if you have to take two non-crimes and
add them together and argue there's a
connection and then when you connect
them the two are greater than the sum of
the parts
now I get that you know that could look
like a RICO thing like a RICO thing is a
whole bunch of things that suggest it's
all connected and stuff so
I don't know to me uh
well I'm just going to go with the
mainstream the walls are closing in they
got them this time once they conflate
those two small things into a big felony
the jury is likely to go for that
it does not seem even slightly dangerous
and
imagine that Trump imagine this is the
last thing he has left
it could be like the last legal thing
and it would mean that all of them were
nothing they were they're either trivial
or just absolutely made up or nothing
so New York Post also reports that
private lead to Santa says he's in the
race do you believe that
do you believe that that desensis is
definitely already decided he's already
created a structure
and he's just waiting to May to announce
it's believable it's believable
but I feel like there was something else
I would need to know
and I think what I would need to know is
what is his thinking about Trump
could it be that he's preparing without
spending too much money or time could he
be preparing in case Trump doesn't run
let's say you get some legal problems or
something else maybe Trump has a health
problem you know anything could happen
between now and may is it possible he's
just getting ready in case
and that his intention to run is
conditional on what Trump does
because I could see that usually being
confused as an intention to run when it
might be a conditional intention to run
as in if this happens and if this
happens I'll run
you know it's always conditional I guess
in reality everything's conditional you
can change your mind at any time
but
does that sound right does it sound like
it might be conditional and maybe he
sees how he pulls or something before he
makes a decision
yeah
all right well
I would uh do you think the world is
better if DeSantis gets in and pushes
Trump
because I love the fact that uh Vivek
Rama Swami's in the in the the race
because he's definitely made the the
primary better he's already made
Republicans better Republicans
I think
yeah
uh well we'll see it'll be interesting I
guess I'd like to see him get in just
because I like competition
uh Tim Poole had cash Patel on his show
and uh he gives two reasons to suspect
that rayaps is a was a Fed working on
January 6 for the feds here is two
reasons one of them is one I gave you uh
first he says that raps was on FBI's
most wanted list for one day and the
next day he was off there are only two
ways that happens you die or you become
an informant now remember cash Patel was
a prosecutor
so he's worked sources so when he says
there's only one you know there's only
one way or two ways you can get off the
FBI's most wanted list he's not guessing
he's not guessing there's only two ways
I mean maybe there's some weird Third
Way
um
and then the other the other point is
the one I gave when the representative
from the FBI I forget which one was
asked by Ted Cruz
under oath
were there any FBI agents involved in
January 6th she refused to answer
and as cash points out and I pointed out
when it happens if the answer was no
you would not say we don't talk about
that stuff
am I right
if the answer is just no
you say no
because you wouldn't be giving up any
secrets and you would resolve the matter
or you'd be closer to resolving it right
there
I don't I don't see any way that Ray
Epps wasn't up to something
you know with the government I don't
know what it doesn't necessarily mean
that he was he was hired to cause the
riot
it could be that you just wanted to do
it anyway but it could be that they were
going to ask him for information about
it or it would help him get into the
maybe he would help him infiltrate you
know more Mega organizations or
something so it's possible that he was
working for the feds but not in some
um
assertive way that caused the the
violence to happen
maybe he was just there to watch and
observe and they're trying to work with
him to make him more of a source in the
future maybe I know so so there is there
is some room for
Ray Epps could be working for the feds I
don't want him to sue me so I'll just
say allegedly
um
and it's still not being what you think
is that a possibility is it a
possibility that he's totally he was
totally working for the government but
that it wasn't a big deal it was just
one of one of the many people there
trying to turn into informants
um
anything is possible that's right
so DeSantis is picking up free money
again as I often say he will do the
thing that when he does it you wonder
why everybody else didn't do it first
have you noticed that quality about
DeSantis he's really good at it like
consistently here's the next the next
one this is just free money best tennis
player in the world I think still Novak
Djokovic is not allowed in the country
for the Miami open which is a huge event
in the country uh much less or even much
more for Florida because he's not
vaccinated
it's 20 23.
the healthiest the healthiest man in the
world can't come into the country
because he's not vaccinated
he might be the healthiest person in the
world if you've ever seen them train and
play I mean he's in really good shape so
uh DeSantis
somehow cleverly realizing that this ban
was about airline travel
he asked the Biden Administration to
confirm that he the Djokovic would be
let into Florida if he came by boat
because apparently you can come by boat
but not Airline
what what
are you kidding me
that's a real thing
that's a real thing
and the government hasn't moved to fix
it so the government should either make
the boats require the vaccination or
make the airlines not but it's just
absurd to have the difference so
apparently uh DeSantis wants to make a
boat available
now
what do you do about that except
standing ovation
am I wrong I mean let's just standing
ovation stuff
yeah that's
[Applause]
that's
there is just no other reaction to that
you just can't react any other way
standing ovation
that's it
and he just keeps doing that
all right uh
war on the cartels so more I guess uh
Lindsey Graham and uh who else Senator
John Kennedy are putting through some
legislation to make the cartels uh
terrorist organizations which would
unleash the military upon them
I believe Ted Cruz is more in favor of
financial actions
uh what do you think would be the best
play Financial only
plus whatever else we're doing Financial
only or direct military action
both yeah I'm going to say both because
that's what it took to be Isis am I
right
Isis was a military PLUS Financial
and
and Trump did seem to succeed in
defeating Isis it does look like it
looks like it to me so
um I don't know what will happen
but I love the fact that the cartel that
kidnapped and then killed two Americans
I love the fact that they apologized
that really happened right
so if you have a cartel apologizing to
the United States that only means one
thing
they do not do not want the military to
get involved do not very much do not
now what does that tell you
I'll tell you what it tells me
president Trump would solve this in an
afternoon
do you know why
because once you know they're afraid of
the military
you negotiate with them directly
imagine Trump talking to the heads of
the cartels because I think he could get
a call
I think Trump could actually get the
hands of the cartel on the phone
don't you
I mean if they thought they could do it
without getting caught I I think so
and I think he could say directly
we're gonna we're gonna up your
 and it's going to happen fast
if you want to get out of the the death
ray that's coming your way and you can't
get out of it the only thing you can do
is negotiate
and that negotiation means you stop
sending stuff to us
maybe we help you uh turn your operation
into something positive
for example would it be crazy
to say that they had whoever the leaders
of the cartels are look
we're very impressed with your
organizational skills
we're also going to kill you
in a week
but if you'd like
Mexico
needs a lot of industry and if you'd
like to do what American robber barons
did in this country which is you start
by doing some really sketchy illegal
become a robber baron
and then you try to move your operation
into legal businesses like Crocker
you know you you was one of the guys
with the the Transcontinental Railroad
those guys were all just bastards and
you know they're just the worst people
in the world by today's standards of
course even then by their standards they
were just horrible people
terrible Crooks
and
when they got rich the thing they needed
more than anything is to is to make
their uh let's say their kids and their
kids kids not live under the oak the
Yoke of some criminal organization so I
believe that Trump could actually
repatriate not repatriate I keep using
that word I think he could actually talk
some of the cartels into taking a better
offer because the other offer is dead
and there's there's no negotiating on
that you either take the offer or you're
dead in a week
I think that's I think Trump could get
that done now you might not be the only
one who can get it done but I think
you'd be the best
I think you'd be the best
you know I think the others maybe you
could do it too
you know the story about fauci you
probably noticed I've talked less about
fauci than anybody who does what I do
you know talking about the news you
probably wondered about that why don't
you talk about fauci more we hate fauci
help us hate fauci some more well one of
the reasons I don't is that I'm very
reluctant to go after uh individuals
right I'd rather talk about you know
unless they're president that's
different but I don't like to go after
individuals unless I have really solid
something solid it just feels like a
dick move to go after an individual
because the news is always so wrong that
whatever you're accusing somebody of is
like what are the odds that's even true
look at the number of people who came
after me in the past couple weeks
how many of them actually knew the story
the the ones who came after me heart
almost none almost none so why do I
think this is the Gelman effect why do I
think that the reporting on fauci is
accurate
I've seen what the reporting on me is
I know what that looks like
don't I but why do you think fauces is
accurate that would be the most
ridiculous assumption that the reporting
on fauci is accurate
that would be ridiculous because it's
never accurate when you're talking about
public figures it just never is it just
isn't you know there's nothing you could
do about that
so that's why I hold off with people
like fauci I heard you know horrible
damning things which
didn't seem totally credible to me
but our current understanding and I'll
say this is all allegations and what
other people believe
is that
fauci indirectly funded gain of function
in Wuhan
then when it got out he
redirected attention away from the lab
and then
he became the uh the leading figure in
fixing the pandemic that if this
reporting is true
he caused
not not by himself of course but he
would be a primary cause
did this really happen
this whole story is too on the nose
right
it looks like it happened it looks like
that narrative might survive a challenge
it might but that is just too like a
book
and one of the what are the odds that
the one guy who funded it
is the highest paid person in the
government who became a superstar for
trying to defeat the virus that he
created allegedly yeah with indirect
funding to the lab
that does does just on the surface
doesn't that strike you as just too it's
a little too neat
you're saying it happened and I'm not
even disagreeing because I don't know
right but that would be the weirdest
simulation story of all time if he
caused it and then he was in charge of
fixing it and then we didn't find out
and how much money do you think fauci's
made
we have no indications but we also don't
know what a stocky holds
right
do we know what stocky holds I don't
believe he is he has to report that
if I had to guess
and this would be just a guess
uh
probably 80 million dollars he made
during the pandemic if I had to guess
just based on he probably you know over
the years he's probably collecting a lot
of stock in companies that would make
money in a pandemic
patents maybe yeah I don't know did he
have an interest in uh
REM desevere
did somebody say it is some kind of
interest in the company that does REM
disappear
I don't know about that so I'll say that
I'm not going to make any accusations
about financial gain because I don't
have details but if I had to guess
and this isn't even about fauci if you
just take fauci out of it and say
somebody is a million years old and
they've been the central person working
for big Pharma in the virus area for all
those years
does he own a substantial stock remember
he was the highest paid government
employee so he had presumably investable
funds but he also probably had some
connections where he would get some
stock from I don't know startups and
stuff
he probably had
let's say 10 million dollars of Pharma
stock before it all started
I don't know if that's true I'm just
speculating if he had 10 million it
probably went to 80 million
because everything went through the roof
so he might have made I don't know 20 80
million dollars during the pandemic that
wouldn't surprise me
would you be surprised if he had a 10
million dollar portfolio and a lot of it
was in Pharma
maybe because he does speeches or worked
with people who've got stock you don't
know he's been around for a long time
well I'm going to say I'm not totally
believing all the stories about fauci
but uh if it is what it looks exactly
like it is
that's pretty alarming
that's pretty alarming it might be it
might be exactly what it looks like all
right this ladies and gentlemen
was
uh
almost the end of my live stream let me
tell you just before I got out I jumped
on a spaces call and there were a number
of black Americans talking and when they
saw me on there they invited me up and
asked me to explain my comments
and how do you think it went when they
asked me to explain my comments
were they receptive
it went very well all right I'm actually
considering uh
re-identifying as black
because black Americans have come out of
you know my little drama for the last
couple weeks black Americans have come
out of this really well like in my
opinion their their reaction to it
sometimes horrified
but they would be horrified and then ask
questions like what did he mean why did
he do it
that's perfect
that's perfect
because I was being hyperbolic to get
people horrified they were but instead
of canceling me they in fact the first
thing the first thing the host said was
that it was the white people that
canceled me and did I agree with that
yes yes absolutely black people haven't
canceled me from anything not a single
thing
they mostly say that's very alarming
what are you talking about
exactly what I wanted
white people just had to signal so they
were they were kind of useless to this
but then I had just enough time
to tell them the entire purpose was to
attract energy to a point which is if
you have people who are looking
backwards with their strategy
such as CRT that's a backwards look
and you compared them to people who have
a forward-looking strategy for life
get a talent stack together systems over
goals all that stuff that you just can't
compare how successful one group would
be to the other so that was the message
I wanted to get through the systemic
racism is real but you can slice through
it if you focus on the tools for
personal success which would include
strategy for getting through systemic
racism
and
I think I penetrated a bubble
because these are things that I've
wanted to say for a while but I was just
preaching to people who largely already
agree with those things
but I but this was the first time I got
invited into what I would consider
definitely not my bubble
now I think I think a number of them may
be leaned right but it was definitely a
sort of a black Centric group and I
don't normally get invited to that so
my original intention
was to
put a message that I think is really
useful focus on personal success
and try to penetrate as many bubbles as
I can now this is a very small small
success but I definitely got a useful
High Ground
totally practical set of ideas into a
bubble where it wouldn't have been
I think that's good
I mean it's a small move but so far my
plan is working weirdly well
better than I expected and beyond that I
seem to be invited everywhere
I'm invited everywhere remember Fox News
seemed to be ignoring my story for a
while I have been invited by you know
Hannity Hannity invited me but I didn't
want to do that yet because I would look
too much like people who agree with me
because I think I think he would do what
everybody would do condemn me for what I
said
and I even condemned myself for it I
said it to get a reaction so you can't
criticize me for doing the thing that I
wanted to do that worked really well
I'm not going to apologize for doing a
thing I wanted to do that works really
well for the people who got offended no
I'm not going to apologize for that so
uh but Larry Elder also invited me on a
show
and what do you think of that
should I do Larry Elder
so it's the same problem he's going to
agree with me yeah I saw an article he
wrote In Real Clear Politics so I know
he's going to be philosophically on the
same side and he would be he would
identify as a conservative but I feel
like I'm not getting the invitations I
want from the left
do you know why the left is not invited
me
do you know why the left is not inviting
me
you know
yeah they're afraid it's literally fear
yeah you saw what happened when uh
Russell Brand went on Ms MSNBC oh he was
on the Bill Maher show with the MSNBC
guy
all right
like you don't want somebody to bring a
wildly different idea into your bubble
if it could destroy your bubble yeah I'm
kind of a bubble breaker
in the worst case scenario I'm just
dangerous at this point I'm literally
dangerous wouldn't you agree
I've made myself literally dangerous to
the to the prevailing narrative because
I'm now impossible to to Res to ignore
I'm impossible to ignore and I have a
message that's a high ground message
meaning as soon as you hear it you say
Okay that was better than what we were
doing
nobody is going to argue that focusing
on personal success for young black
people
is a good strategy nobody they will only
say but also other things need to be
done and then I'll say how's that
working out
how are those other things working out
a lot less systemic racism this year
than last
none of it's working I can agree with
all that stuff being important but
nobody's doing anything about it so
instead you need to you need to fortify
the individual
so the individual is you know
invulnerable to the worst parts of
systemic racism you just slice right
through him like how do you slice
through them like a
you'll slice through systemic racism if
you have the right tools like a
hot rod through butter that's correct
like a hot rod through butter
all right so my plan is working out
swimmingly well
um
let me ask the people who are less
familiar with me because there are
always a few
over on YouTube especially so
YouTubers have you ever seen me
influence beyond the the race question
have you ever seen any influence a
national event
in a positive way
so just look at the comments if I ever
influence a national event in a positive
way
right so those of you who are not
familiar with what I've been doing for
the last five years uh look at the
answers now you can ignore the nose
because that just means they're not
familiar the yeses are telling you
everything you need to know you wouldn't
have that many yeses unless people
noticed
there's a real thing that's happening
that I'm part of the locals group is
part of it and now you're part of it
which is anybody who boosts my signal
is doing something good
now not the hyperbolic symbol don't
boost my uh
hyperbole but boost my reframe and the
reframe is work on your individual
success skills
and you will do fine
and there you go thanks for listening
YouTube I'll be with you again tomorrow
I appreciate you being here
