well all you youtubers
should be enjoying excellent audio
quality today
i got you all hooked up on two separate
road casters
each one going to a separate stream
through one microphone
took me only five years to get to this
place
but i'll bet it sounded really good
really good
and if you'd like to take it up to
another level all you need is a couple
of marker glasses tanker chelsea
stein a kinty jugger flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with that's right your favorite
liquid
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything amazing it's called the
simultaneous
join me now
ah so good
well we've got all kinds of fun news
today are you ready for it
it's coming at you coming at you hot
well rasmussen had a poll today asking
about
should schools require masks
and because all of us follow the science
when they do a poll about should people
should kids wear masks obviously
everybody answered the same way
because we all follow science
so science told us what to think and
then the poll came out and everybody
just said the same thing
no they didn't of course they didn't
because
follow the science really means do
whatever your political party told you
was right
and so 58 of democrats said yes
put masks on those kids if you need them
but only 27
of republicans said the same thing so
twice as many democrats are in favor of
mass
than republicans but i don't think it's
so much a science
question although that's a big part of
it
as it is a freedom question and a
quality of life question
i would think so i think republicans are
responding more to the
life quality risk management situation
and how about should schools require
vaccinations before you can attend in
person
once again democrats 56 said yes
but republicans only 29
do you think there's any question at all
that we could not turn into a political
question
how in the world did this become
political
we're just so primed that whatever the
other team says
is true it must be false but here we are
we even think that mass and vaccinations
are at least semi-political question
i figured out a mystery yesterday which
is i couldn't figure out why
i was getting criticism on mass and
vaccinations
when nobody would ever mention anything
that i was wrong about
or that they disagreed with me but
people were pretty darn sure
that i was doing something awful and
misinforming people
but i couldn't get any specifics what
exactly are you disagreeing with
and i think i finally figured out the
problem which is that
when i talk about my own experience
and my own just personal opinion people
think i'm
trying to persuade you but i say it
as often as possible i don't care if you
get vaccinated
i really don't i don't care at all
because i got vaccinated so i made my
choice
i made my health care choice you make
yours
do i do you think i give a
about whether you've decided that your
risk management is better one way or the
other
i trust you i completely trust you
make your own decision i'm fine with
that it doesn't have to be the same as
mine
but here's the hard part
how can i tell you my personal point of
view
without it being persuasive accidentally
because i've told you i think it would
be entirely unethical
for me to recommend or recommend against
anything medical
but if you talk about it you end up
being persuasive because
it's impossible not to be so what do i
do
what do i do if the normal way that i
just communicate
is extra persuasive even if i don't want
it to be
could i just stop talking about it yeah
i see in the comments just stop talking
about it
how about now i'm going to talk
about anything i want
how about that how about i'm going to
talk about any thing i want
so let's let's get that out of the way
um
but let me i guess the best i can do is
tell you this
if i tell you that the way i feel and i
did a tweet on this that was
i think misinterpreted my own fault i'm
sure
but the the tweet said that uh if
if you're not vaccinated you're in the
middle of a pandemic but if you are
vaccinated it's just wednesday now
people
interpreted that as persuasion but it
wasn't meant to be
it was meant to tell you how i feel and
i imagine some other people feel that
way which is why it's worthy of tweeting
but the fact that i feel more
comfortable
vaccinated doesn't have anything to do
with you
i'm just telling you i feel more
comfortable if you feel more comfortable
not being vaccinated well that's part of
your decision
and i'm fine with it whatever you
whatever you want to do is fine
so just to be clear i'm not persuading
you on mass
or vaccinations in terms of using them
but if you're gonna
but the question of whether they work or
not
that's just somewhat objective that's
something i could talk about
but not today i know you're sick of it
um so anyway i'm not trying to persuade
you on vaccinations
so here's the weirdest situation
most of you know that jen saki
said that the said out loud in public
that the white house is bringing to the
attention of facebook
various accounts that um
okay i see that article you're referring
to the mit re technology but i'm not
sure how to fit that in here
all right so the the white house is
telling the facebook
to uh maybe deal with or take down some
accounts that are spreading in their
view
misinformation about uh
i think about the pandemic which they
call problematic
that's the word now here's the thing
i think we all understand that the first
amendment only refers to the government
and that a private entity
does have the right to have terms of
service that could end up censoring you
and i think everybody gets that right
private companies can do what they want
government isn't allowed to
to restrict your free speech but what
happens if the government
starts working with that private company
and influencing them in a way that
really a private company would have a
hard time resisting
because of the the political
considerations for later
you know facebook needs congress and the
president to be at least a little bit on
their side
for a variety of reasons forever
so could facebook really just say ah
just go pound salt
we'll we're just gonna ignore you we
don't care if you think this is a
problem
uh free speech yay well they could
it's you know it's physically possible
it's legally possible
but would they would they you know in
the in the real sense
don't you think facebook pretty much is
going to be influenced by the government
now as joel pollock reported um i guess
uh and i didn't see it live but i guess
uh mark levin who knows more about these
things than
most of us says that that alone
makes it a violation of the uh i think i
have this right
that's what makes it a violation of the
um
first amendment because the government
is involved
they're they're forcing facebook to do
it and here's what's funniest
it effectively completes
trump's lawsuit against the
platforms now in this case specifically
in this case specifically facebook
but at this point if you had a jury
and the jury knew that the government
was trying to get facebook to censor
some people
doesn't trump win
i mean you know i'm obviously not a
lawyer i'd love to see
you know viva and barnes on their part
podcast talk about this maybe they
already have it i've missed it
but i'd love to get um a few more legal
opinions
maybe uh maybe a dershowitz
type of opinion on whether this is now a
slam dunk
does trump win the lawsuit now and what
would that even mean
my my instinct is that he won't win
because they're going to be a million
twists and turns in the law
and god knows you know what happens
there so i don't think anything's
straightforward on these
types of issues but from a common sense
perspective
you know outside of the legal domain
since
most of us are not lawyers um
so aviva barnes i'm literally reading a
comment said this lawsuit was dead a few
days ago
but that could change now right yeah the
this new information
seems like it would make a difference to
me and if only
if the only difference it made is in
public opinion that's still a pretty big
difference
all right there was a big ivermectin
study
a big randomized control trial that got
apparently got pulled back
because it was not so good
meaning it might have been fraudulent
not sure of that
but there's some suggestions it was just
complete
now the problem was as i understand it
that that particular trial was extra
large and if you do a meta study where
you look at all the tests
and you sort of lump them together and
say all right
each of these individual tests may have
its problems
but if you lump them all together and
see what the average is you can sort of
average out the problems and get
something useful
but what happens if your entire result
is biased by by one
trial let's say there's one big one
and you average that in with the little
ones so the big one
basically makes all the difference if
you took it down it might might even
change the outcome
what happens if the biggest one is a
fraud
what happens to your your meta analysis
well you know depends on the sizes right
it depends on how big that fraudulent
one was but we now have uh once again
two movies on one screen i think brett
weinstein has
responded to this by saying that this
one study doesn't change the fact that
you know generally speaking pretty much
all the studies point in the same
direction
so even if you take it out doesn't make
much difference
whereas other people who are smarter
than i am
say nope we did the math and if you take
this one out it changes everything
which one's true no idea
i have no idea and if you think you know
well you're probably wrong because we
don't know
this is again one of those situations
where
somebody can show you an apple and say
there's no apple in my hand and half of
the world don't see the apple
half of the half of the people see it
and half of the people don't
what the hell are you gonna do do your
own research
that never works do your own research
yeah to me that's one of the most
ridiculous things you've ever heard
it used to be a some investment
i don't know i think it was a low-cost
brokerage service
they used to tell people to do their own
research before they invested
probably about the dumbest thing anybody
could ever do
if you're buying individual stocks
literally the dumbest thing you can do
but people don't know that they're like
oh i'll do my own research
i will use my gigantic brain to
peer into the complexity and come up
with a
a brilliant idea or an opinion
then i wish to hell
i could block people on youtube because
you i want to block us so
badly
not all of you of course just just the
ones who are screaming about the sound
today
still can you shut up
but apparently apparently i don't have
blocking ability i
only have the ability to hide you from
the stream or something like that
all right well this guy a hide user on
this channel
see if that makes any difference or did
it just hide it from me
all right just one person i think i got
rid of them all right
so here's what we know about ivermectin
nothing
nothing i've been looking into this
ivormectin for
how long now you're reading all the
stories and following it and everything
and i'm at the point where i would say i
don't know anything
because i can't tell which of these two
completely different worlds is right
if you take this one study out does it
change anything
some people say yes some people say no
and that's all i know
so can't even form an opinion on it
well apparently uh southern california
or at least maybe l.a
is looking to reintroduce masked
mandates
are you kidding me how would you
like to be
governor newsome he's uh he's got a
recall campaign
and half of the state just found out
that they might need masks again
how would you like to be running running
in a recall election under that scenario
i feel like that should be enough to
defeat him but maybe california won't
work that way
and i also wonder how many people would
have to just refuse
refuse paying attention to the rule
before it had to just go away
what do you think is the percentage of
people who
let's say would take off a mask and go
into a store
anyway and then force the store to kick
them out
go peacefully but just make the store
kick you out and how many what
percentage of the public would have to
do that
before the store would give up
i feel 20 would be plenty
yeah it might be closer to 5 or 10
percent but 20
would get it done right yeah 30 gets it
done for sure
because the stores don't have that kind
of resource and they're not really
in the in the job of policing
california made the tragic mistake
of deciding that it wouldn't prosecute
small crimes
huh the state won't prosecute small
crimes and not wearing a mask
would be a very very small crime
i'm not even sure you'd call it a crime
what would it be a
violation of a regulation i don't know i
don't even know if it's a regulation
what is it so
at what point do twenty percent of the
public just say we're done
i think twenty percent gets it done
we'll find out
i don't think that this uh that this new
masking mandate will hold
but we'll see we'll see
well let's talk about the election
audits talk about your
two movies on one screen situation
so we have two completely different uh
worlds in one world the courts have
found no evidence
of widespread voter fraud and according
to factcheck.org as of
right now this is brand new
current information as of right now
factcheck.org factcheckout.org says
audits of ballots and voting equipment
found no problems
with the 2020 results in maricopa county
but debunked claims about voter fraud
are flowing again
on social media and being a
republican-led audit in maricopa
so by this world view courts have found
no evidence of widespread fraud and
the audit so far in maricopa has found
nothing wrong nothing to worry about
okay that's one world here's the other
world
uh seventy four thousand mail-in ballots
in american
in maricopa county alone have no record
of them being sent
what no record of them being sent
now of course there should be some kind
of record but they're not
and on twitter christopher hill asked
this question
which you're going to be pissed off at
watch how pissed off you are when you
hear christopher hill's question
are you ready i guarantee this is going
to piss you off
all right most of you already heard the
news that there are over 74 000 mail in
ballots
with no record of being sent okay we all
know that part now
right here's the question that you
didn't ask yet
it's gonna piss you off
christopher hill asks i wonder what was
the vote ratio of the no record ballots
versus the others right
why the don't you know that
who is it who's going to tell us that
there's 74 000 ballots
with no record of them being sent
without
also telling us how the they voted
right isn't that like
the whole point because what if
what if these 74 000 votes were pretty
much in line with the rest of the votes
what's that mean well it probably means
that there's no problem
but what if the votes were all for joe
biden or 90
for joe biden big problem
really big big big problem
are you telling me that it was important
to tell us that
all these mail-in ballots don't have a
record of being sent
but it wasn't important enough to
 count them
and find out who they voted for and just
tell us
just tell us right now
i was open-minded about the
quality of the auditors doing the audit
maybe they're good
maybe they're not maybe they don't have
to be that good to find problems i don't
know
i'm no expert on this but when i see
that
somehow this information came out of the
audit about the
mail-in ballots that have no record of
being sent
and they don't tell us how those people
voted
that's freaking incompetent right
i mean if anything else just the
communication about it is incompetent i
mean completely incompetent
could not be more incompetent i'm
talking
general milly level of incompetent
that's pretty high we'll talk about him
in a minute
maricopa county tweeted fact check
we did not do we did not agree to do a
forensic audit with uncertified
contractors oh damn this is a problem so
it turns out that the contractors
who are doing the audit who were hired i
think by mostly republicans
they're uncertified damn it
uncertified contractors wow
that's a big problem do you think we
should get some certified
auditors how about getting some
certified ones
do you know why we don't have any
certified audits
it's not a thing it's not a
thing
there are there are no certified audits
or auditors
do you go to the office of auditor
licensing
no doesn't exist there's no
thing
called a certified contractor but here
the maricopa county is like
nope nope we got no certified auditors
working on this
no certified contractors it's going to
be a problem
oh my god um
so apparently the things that the
auditors have found so far
suggest that number one
you can't fully audit the election
would everybody say that's true no
matter what you think about the audit
no matter whether you think there will
be widespread fraud there or not
no matter what you think about the
outcome is it a true statement
that we can say for sure that the
election can't be audited
we didn't build a system that could be
audited now
and i think everybody's agreeing with
that if you don't build a system
that can be audited and keep in mind
that we counted the votes the first time
in what two days
but to audit the system takes months do
you see how poorly designed that is
that the original vote takes two days
but an audit takes months
the audit should take the same amount of
time
or something similar i mean maybe it
takes a week but it shouldn't take
months
if it takes months you've designed the
whole system wrong and apparently a lot
of what the delay is
is trying to free up records from
various people who have them don't want
to give them
and then you have the electronic voting
machines
in which the company has some
proprietary stuff
and so apparently the records are just
not available
so you actually can't audit the election
what would you say about an audit that
about an election that can't be audited
well you could say two things
first thing you can say is no court
has found any widespread fraud in the
2020 election
would you all agree that's true no court
has determined that there is widespread
fraud in the 2020 election i think
that's true
it's also true that no lawnmower
has ever baked a cake would you agree
no lawnmower has ever baked the cake
also no glass of water
has ever flown to mars it's true
it's true i'm not even making it up no
glass of water
has ever launched itself and into space
and gone to mars
likewise no court has ever found
widespread fraud
now you might say to yourself but scott
a
glass of water is really not designed to
launch into space and go to mars
and a lawnmower isn't really designed to
bake a cake that's the point
the court is not designed to audit
elections
they can only look at what's presented
to them which is a little fraction of
you know the world and they just said
we're not going to deal with that for
procedural reasons usually so that's
about it
so it doesn't mean anything that courts
didn't find what they're not looking for
but here's what we can say for sure if a
system can't be audited
it will be corrupted either already has
or will be soon does anybody disagree
with that statement i say it a lot
i say it a lot because it's so
provocative that we don't know what's
happened
so far but any system that can't be
audited
will eventually be corrupted pretty much
guaranteed
because people who are willing to do
this exist
everywhere you know that we're we're
saturated with people who would do a bad
thing if they could get away with it
and if you can't be audited you can
definitely get away with it
right would anybody disagree with the
fact that there are plenty of people
willing to do it because we live in that
kind of a world
and if they know they're going to get
away with it because it can't be audited
of course they'll do it of course
there isn't the slightest chance they
won't do it eventually
you just don't know if it's happened yet
there's a weird thing happening with
anthony bourdain there's a new
documentary film
apparently somebody created an ai
that could speak in his style
and the ai actually came up with some
sentences that he never spoke
so the a.i of anthony bourdain
had its own thoughts
what and so the question is is it
ethical
to use an ai to put words in the mouths
of the deceased
well as you know i have many of you know
i have offered that i would like to be
a model for one of the first ais now i
guess
bourdain might be the first or one of
the first to be the model
but i would offer myself as uh someone
whose
public you know thoughts and words are
are so pervasive on the internet
and and also the video and audio of me
that i would be a good candidate to turn
into ai
even if you're just practicing right
um i see your question about aoc and yes
she's still smart
even if you don't like what she said
yesterday or
the day before um
so i would like to give permission
that any ai that's built based on me
has my permission to extend my
personality
so if my a1 if my ai wants to say things
that i never said
but seems to be compatible with what i
might have said
i'm okay with that we all evolve right
you've certainly changed over your
lifetime you're not the same person you
were as a kid
so if you can change over your lifetime
in your organic entity
once i become a digital entity
once i become a digital entity
um why can't i keep evolving
so um
so i'd like to give permission today
that if somebody wants to make an
ai based on me just just scoop up all
the information about me on the internet
and if you want to say new things after
i'm deceased
you have my explicit permission
all right um i'm loving this uh
dispute between trump and general milley
so on morning joe i think it was it was
reported that
reportedly uh general milley on january
6 or so got a call from an old friend
quote an old friend with an explicit
warning that trump and his allies
were trying to quote overturn the
government
oh that's bad that's bad
they might try to overturn the
government
um what's that mean what does it mean to
overturn the government exactly
if uh if an election was shown to be
fraudulent
and then the outcome was reversed
would that be called overturning a
government
because it sort of would be but it would
be working within the system
if protesters protest and try to get the
system that exists to work to make the
election more credible or even changed
the result
is that overturning an election
or is that just making sure democracy
worked
and got you what you wanted well i would
say that words like overturning the
government are kind of dangerous
and apparently what millie said was
quote
they may try but they're not going to
effing succeed
he told aids they're not going to
succeed
right because
it's a bunch of people with no weapons
against the military of the united
states
so i didn't really need a four-star
general to tell
me that guy with viking hat
cannot defeat a tank
we kind of knew that right so
general milly is like pretty tough i'm
gonna
if they think they can defeat the entire
military of the united states
well they've got another thing coming
with their viking hats and their twist
ties
and their blunt objects we got it
covered
will drone their asses if they try
i swear every day i think general milly
it gets dumber
so trump in his inevitable way
responded to the allegations
and for your entertainment because i
know how much you've missed
the entertainment that is president
trump
i'm going to read to you exactly as he
wrote it
hey good drawing of dilbert there
exactly as
uh he wrote it and
i would like to tell you that the most
underrated thing about trump
is that he's an exceptional writer
i hate to tell you because i know a lot
of you even even supporters are like
what what trump is an exceptional writer
he is
really good at writing i mean better
than just about
i don't know 99 of writers so
because he keeps this simple which is a
skill
not a defect and it took it took me
about five years to convince the world
that simplicity is a skill it's not a
defect
so listen to just listen to how his
his writing pops now he probably just
dictated this
so it sounds it also makes it sound more
natural
but look at the simplicity and the just
it just pops
all right a statement by donald trump
45th president of the united states
despite massive voter fraud and
irregularities
during the 2020 election scam
first sentence his first sentence
just makes your blood start to boil the
hair on my arm is standing up
it's the first sentence and he's already
got me in a i'm
already in like a four-alarm panic it's
like
despite the massive voter fraud and
irregularities during the 2020 elections
scam that we are now seeing play out in
very big and important states
i never threatened or spoke about to
anyone
a coup of our government so ridiculous
exclamation and so ridiculous
is perfect writing because
he doesn't like give you all his reasons
whether he just he goes
so ridiculous so that's that's good for
him he goes sorry to
inform you but an election is my form of
coup
and if i was going to do a coup one of
the last people i would want to do it
with
is general mark milley and now it gets
fun
now do you believe him do
do his words suggest
that he's telling the truth i'm going to
say yes
you know usually it's a little hard to
tell if
a politician is lying or maybe it's not
that hard if their lips are moving
but the way he the way he defends
himself
does come across as completely
legitimate
and i'm not saying that just because i
like trump
which i do i like him as a person
but i i think it just looks legitimate
all right let me go on so he's talking
about general mark milley and he says
he got his job only because the world's
most overrated general
james mattis could not stand him
now he's sort of an appeal to authority
that other people that you might like
also don't like him couldn't could not
stand them had no respect for him
and would not recommend him that's
pretty damning
because most of you even if you don't
like trump you might like
james mattis because he was sort of
anti-trump
and apparently according to trump he had
no respect for
millie to me the fact that mattis didn't
like him
just like obama didn't like him oh now
this is good
obama didn't like him either i don't
know if that's true
but you know let's say it is um
and actually fired millie so obama fired
millie
okay i didn't know that was true but
probably true uh was a good thing not a
bad thing
i often act counter to people's advice
who i don't respect
he doesn't even respect his advice ouch
there goes in any event i lost respect
for milly
when we walked together to st john's
church which was still smoldering from a
radical left fire set that day before
side by side a walk that has now been
proven to be totally appropriate
and that's true and the following day
millie choked like a dog
i love it when trump says that choked
like a dog
he didn't he didn't just hesitate he
didn't just
joke he choked like a dog
now remember nobody can write
the the way that trump does it's visual
all right so he changed he changed you
know whatever
behavior billy had into a visual of a
dog choking
that's great writing it's great writing
um billy choked like a dog in front of
the fake news
when they told him they thought he
should not have been walking with the
president
which turned out to be incorrect now
here trump is actually
completely factually accurate he
apologized profusely
making it a big story instead of saying
i am proud to walk with
and protect the president of the united
states
you know trump's right
right trump's right
the the correct thing that milly should
have done
is to say exactly what trump just said
um that it was his you know his uh
responsibility to protect protect the
president basically
um and then he says had he said that
it would have all been over probably
true no big deal
but i saw at the moment he had no
courage or skill
he's just he's just eviscerating this
guy certainly not the type of person i
would be talking
to with and then trump says i'm not into
coups
exclamation mark this is where he sold
me completely
it's one thing to say i wasn't doing it
and then you could say well maybe you
were maybe you were doing it you're just
saying you were doing it
but he goes to another level and he says
i'm not into coups
and it feels true
because his opinion is something he
doesn't really hold back on
right he's trump is notoriously loose
with facts
correct me if i'm wrong right trump is
very loose with facts
and and fails the fact-checking all the
time usually with hyperbole and you know
it's not a big deal
but does he ever hold back his opinion
think about it does he ever hold back
his opinion
i don't think so i don't know if he's
ever held back his opinion
and so he just gave it to you i'm not
into coups
that's an opinion right so when
trump gives you his opinion it does come
across as credible
because he doesn't he doesn't filter his
opinion maybe he should
right maybe we think he should opinion
he he shouldn't be so opinionated but
i've never seen him filter an opinion so
i believe that he's
uh he's completely accurate about this
and he goes on in fact around the same
time millie in a conversation
was an advocate for changing all of the
names of our military forts and bases
so he's dragging him into that
conversation i realized then
also he was a much different person than
i had hoped
i said to him spend more time thinking
about china and russia
and less time on being politically
correct
ouch ouch
trump just destroyed this guy now but of
course since
trump is sort of semi-banned from
social media he has to get there
indirectly with these press statements
and
hoping other people tweet them so i
don't know how many people
you know ended up seeing this but man
that's just
such good writing and it did ring true
like yeah i'm not sure i would i'm not
going to uh
i'm not going to say that everything
trump says is going to
you know match the facts but i believe
his opinions are really his opinions
that stuff does look like he
consistently gives you his real opinions
um
all right so how we doing here
that is just about what i wanted to talk
about today did i miss any
topics that you're dying to
talk about um
somebody says the sunspots predict an
ice age well maybe
delve into fulton county tomorrow well
i feel like the fulton county audit and
the maricopa audit
they they're kind of almost the same
thing
i think that if one of them is is uh
corrupt the other one will be too feels
like it and if they're both
and if one of them is clean probably the
other one's clean
we'll find out um
and the south china sea yeah
you know the south china sea is just an
ongoing cat and mouse thing but
ultimately
china is going to own the south china
sea i think
i don't see how that could go any other
way they're just too big and too
determined and they have too much of a
long-term
feeling about it oh yeah quantum
entanglement
apparently there was a big breakthrough
in quantum computing
specifically they succeeded in changing
a particle at a distance without any
time passing which is a weird
weird part of quantum physics now if
they can
commercialize that and i maybe it can't
even be done
i don't know if you can bring it down to
a device that you can actually just
fire up and boot up and it's a computer
but if they can quantum computer just
sort of changes everything
you know i don't think we're ready for
it the
the degree of difference that we'll make
to have computing that's
suddenly is it a million times better
could somebody give me an estimate if
quantum computing works
and we can commercialize it make it a
product would it be
a million times faster
something like that or you know a
thousand times faster
what would be the right somebody says a
quadrillion i don't think so but
but the difference is not like just
faster
right every year your computer gets a
little faster but you don't
notice that much but if it's you know
a thousand times faster everything's
different the applications you can do
yeah bitcoin mining encryption will be
beaten
i mean everything just changes and i
would imagine that the first
government to build a quantum computer
isn't going to tell anybody for a while
because the first country that gets the
the quantum computer
will have this enormous
enormous military advantage so i don't
think they're going to tell anybody for
a while
maybe we already have it could our maybe
we're already
unencrypting other nations all the time
google said it was 100 million times
faster really
a hundred million times faster
really maybe
i mean i'm not gonna so it's not speed
it's bandwidth
somebody says bandwidth
i see what you're saying it's it's a
transmission thing but
it's also computing
jim says that the israeli coveted
information shows that the vaccination
does not work
now i believe that you are wrong and
that that's just bad analysis
and i think that the people who have the
vaccinations are not dying
but the you know there's plenty of
spread but i believe that you would find
in israel that the vaccinated people are
just not dying
correct me if i'm wrong but if they're
not dying the vaccination works
do we agree
yeah and in the meantime as somebody
said in the comments
we're educating chinese students on
quantum computing
in this country probably a bad idea
uh have we given internet access to cuba
yet and if not why not
quantum computing is not useful for
almost anything
well not yet but if it if it does what
you know its promise suggests it would
be a very big deal
um all the hospitals are filling up with
the no vaccinated
folks all right yeah i'm seeing a lot of
larry elder for
governor i'm gonna have to look into him
um i'm gonna block you
all right big boy floyd says please
check the road caster i think you turned
off youtube audio
no i did not so
you get hidden
and anybody else who thinks that the
sound is bad gets hidden
all right 3d printers were supposed to
change everything
nope well i would say 3d printers
are the flip phone of smartphones
so far meaning that 3d printing has to
reach a certain level
before the big change i mean
when you get to the point where ordering
from amazon doesn't make sense
because you can just print it
that that changes everything
somebody on the locals platform just
suggested that i mess with the
the youtube feed by pretending to talk
but not talking that would be unkind
but funny uh can you print a brick yes
you can
yeah you know i think that the 3d
printers
um when a 3d printer can print a 3d
printer i'll be impressed
you know to that point uh years ago i
heard i had a
i was at a dinner with a futurist
paul i can't remember his last name but
he was a famous
futurist and years ago he said that the
biggest change in civilization will
happen when robots can make robots
and at the time you know robotics and ai
wasn't nearly as advanced because this
was probably 15 years ago
and i thought to myself i think you're
right
as soon as the robots can make other
robots
we're done working it's just going to be
robots making robots
um
no it wasn't kurzweil it was paul i
can't remember his last name
all right um
locals replay yesterday had low audio
somebody says no
it didn't i replayed it and it had loud
audio
um drug overdoses are up 30 percent
yeah uh
oh uh ehrlich yeah it was paul ehrlich
how the hell did you come up with his
last name just from his first name
that was pretty good whoever did that um
all right can you look at both of us or
start to think we're not being ignored
well i'm trying to yeah so i've got
another ipad
on order and then i'll have the cameras
together in the center and then we'll be
fine
and that is all i have to do to say
today
to youtubers i'll talk to you youtubers
tomorrow
