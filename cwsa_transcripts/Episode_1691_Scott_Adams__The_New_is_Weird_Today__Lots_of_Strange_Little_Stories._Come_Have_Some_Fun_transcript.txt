but you won't be able to you're not
going to be able to find me
so unfortunately you won't be able to
find me some of you might prefer youtube
just because you can listen to it while
you're doing other things on your phone
isn't that funny as soon as i talked
about the algorithm
it doesn't look like youtube is working
does it
youtube was always online until you
turned it off well i got a screenshot if
somebody said it wasn't online and i saw
the comments stopped so
it's not just your channel oh it's a
youtube problem
um i've had i've been having all kinds
of internet problems for the last week
is anybody having a lot of internet
problems in the last week
i'm wondering if we're if something's
getting hacked over here
nope nope nope yes nope
i knew a lot of people say yes because
that's confirmation bias
all right well i think we're all good
now
yay youtube you all came back thank you
i appreciate it sorry about the
technical problem anyway i was saying
that i have a different algorithm than
the rest of you because human beings
decide what to send me and then i look
at that so i am free of the algorithm
but not free of your fluids
so if you want to influence somebody who
influences other people you're doing a
job
in fact there are there are a number of
people who follow me
who
are very influential on my content
because every day they're going to send
me some article that's interesting and
some some of you are really good at
guessing
what stuff i like
all right
here's what i say about inflation people
ask me about inflation all the time and
what i say about inflation is really the
same thing that a russian general would
say to putin
no tanks
no tanks
that's what i say to inflation and the
russian general says to putin
um well so the uk is uh doubling down as
we like to say
in this talking about the news business
they're doubling down
everybody's always doubling down or
or walking it back
nobody's ever in the same place are they
i'd like to hear a story of somebody
who's like
somebody did something
and they're just doing exactly the same
thing
they're just doing more of it
no they're always doubling down or
walking it back
or their flip-flop
well the uk is a doubling down and
they're dashed to nuclear power
so according to a report in the guardian
i guess and i saw it in breitbart also
um
so boris johnson is going to meet with
nuclear experts and
try to
make the
the industry let's say more approachable
and friendlier
so that people thinking about investing
in nuclear energy
would not have to worry so much about
the government
prohibitions
so
have i ever been more right about
anything
now i'm not going to say that my opinion
was much different than any of yours
but i have for several years been saying
as as michael schellenberger mike
schneider or mark snyder
have been helping
or really leading i'm not going to say
helping they've been leading
doesn't it feel good to be this right
i'm being asked what about the
significance of the passage of time
well the passage of time is very
significant and here's the reason
it's because of the significance
of time
when combined with the passage
if you put them together
that's the significance of time right
there
aren't you glad you found that out that
is directly from your vice president
harris
all right um
ron desantis continues to be awesome
that should be my headline
every day
i might have a
new section of my live stream
that will be things that desantis did
today
that are smarter than all the other
republicans put together
how in the world
is ron desantis doing one thing after
another that is so
tone perfect
for his base
but also not so bad
for the democrats
he he's really doing the thing that
nobody's ever done before
the thing that
desantis is doing
is finding ways to totally satisfy his
base
while still picking off some from the
other side
which is a really good trick i'll give
you an example
so
apparently
he signed some declaration from florida
so it's not any kind of binding law or
anything
but
essentially saying that the winner of
the ncaa
swimming whatever competition it was
the 500 to 500 freestyle
um they said that the woman who came in
officially second sarasota's emma wyant
uh they florida has declared that she's
really the winner
because according to florida according
to florida not me
the person who won first place was a
biological male
and therefore ruining ncaa
ncaa sports and women's sports
and it's all a mockery of it all and so
this is what florida's doing now
correct me if i'm wrong
for his base
it's a two-part question for his base is
this pitch perfect
it is isn't it i don't think you could
do this any better
because i like the form that he used
he didn't make a law you just he just
stated
uh officially from the perspective of
florida the winner was the person who
was named number two
it's provocative it's it's in your face
he shows his reasons now here's the
beauty
that probably captured
close to all of his base
close to
but don't you think that picked off a
few democrats
am i right
you don't think there are a few
democrats who have female athletes in
the house
who have been looking at this story and
saying you know
those crazy
republicans i hate those crazy
republicans
but i got to give it to them on this one
am i right
yeah more than a few
so
why don't other people do this
when you see when you see desantis
uh do something this capable
and i guess capable is the right word
he's just so capable
somebody says reagan was good at this i
don't i don't have any examples that you
want to hear another example
both of these examples
are freaking today
yesterday i guess
two examples from desantis that are so
tone perfect
they'll make you cry
i mean rarely do you see somebody do
their job whatever their job is
this well
and florida just signed into law
that in order to graduate high school in
florida you have to also graduate or you
have to take a course in financial
literacy
now is there anybody in the republican
world
who would disagree
with people having financial literacy as
a high school requirement it's just half
a credit it's not going to absorb your
whole life
100 what do you say there's nobody who's
against that in fact if you were to
compare
teaching financial literacy in school
to half of the things they teach
geometry which one's more useful
geometry or financial literacy it's not
even close trigonometry or fun
i could go down the list
let's see uh
iranian history
that's being taught in california
schools iranian your persian history
what's more important that or financial
literacy is no it's not even close
although i think you know history of
other places is useful too
now
here's the thing you might not know
about
where have you heard the topic of
financial literacy
before
now remember all pretty much all
republicans are going to love that
where have you heard it before because
i've brought it up and do you remember
the context
so people have been watching me for a
long time
i've brought up financial literacy to be
taught in schools do you remember the
context i brought that up
it was from hawke newsom
one of the black lives matter leaders at
the time i don't know if he's associated
anymore but at the time
that was a black lives matter or at
least one leader i mean
i can just talk about one person so
hawk newsom told me personally
you know
here's one thing pretty much everybody
should agree on
which is financial literacy in school
that was from him that was from hawk
ron desantis
found free money
and picked it up
where do you ever see that
trump right trump is the only person
i've ever seen pick up so much free
money it's like wait a minute there's
nobody in the world saying that kids
should have financial literacy
all republicans like it
black lives
matter likes it probably i mean i don't
think that hawk is the one person who
likes that right that would be very
unlikely
so desantis came up with an idea that is
100 base support
and
black support
and
probably a good deal of democrats
i'm not i'm not wrong about this
these are two examples
where desantis threaded the needle like
nobody's ever nobody ever has and for as
far as i know i can't think of anybody
he threaded the needle maybe better than
anybody since bill clinton
i think bill clinton was good at that
now trump was good at it in the sense of
let's say
he did some things that were popular
like prison reform
popular with the left but that's
different
because that wasn't nearly as popular
with his base
right
so i give trump credit because i think
he did the right thing with
with prison reform
but he didn't give credit for it
desantis in theory should get credit for
both of his moves here
i'll put you in timeout
all right um now here's my other
question
who is advising
desantis
how is he getting such good
advice
or is this him
because these the things he's doing
don't really think they don't look like
the things the governor comes up with on
his own
somebody says you are no i'm not i'm not
i'm not yeah someone i'm sorry i think i
asked the question like i was leading
you to think it was me no i'm not
um so let me let me say it clearly
i don't have any
direct or indirect well i suppose
everybody has an indirect but i don't
have any uh channel to dissent
but boy is he killing it now i don't
think he's killing it on persuasion
in the traditional sense
i think that the persuasion he's using
it doesn't suggest
persuasion expertise
it it suggests
a a policy cleverness that i haven't
ever really observed before it's like
operating at a higher level of
cleverness
and then it has the effect of being
persuasive i think i think it will
all right
we're watching a lot of supreme court
grandstanding which is the only thing
that comes out of these hearings usually
lindsey graham
i think it's his moment to shine don't
you
don't you think lindsey graham
just loves it
when the democrats are nominating a
supreme court
justice
because
graham has he's carved out this little
area
where he disagrees with his own party
about
stopping qualified nominees
now i have to admit
i have to admit i do agree with lindsey
graham
about how much you should fight the
other side's nomination if it's
qualified person
by the way did you hear uh
i may have this wrong but i thought i
heard dana dana perrino
on the five was it dana i think i was
listening to it so i was only hearing
voices
mentioned that
that
under some prior president
um there was a republican who was going
to nominate a black woman
to a high court not the supreme court
but that the democrats
filibustered it and prevented it was it
under bush and the the reason that the
democrats
prevented the republicans
from nominating a black woman to the
high court
is because they didn't want a black
republican woman so close to the supreme
court
because that would allow a republican
to make the first black woman
nomination
now
it was told on tv like that's now an
understood
historical fact
is it
is it
i mean i don't know if i trust anything
if we don't trust the news today why
would we trust the news from
from then i'm not sure sure i totally
believe we could know that and what
people were thinking but
that would be
oh graham stated the same thing it is
well
okay let me let me correct what i just
said i think if lindsey graham said it
in public in this context
i would i would believe that
i think that lindsey graham is a
politician so you can't can't trust
everything he's ever said everywhere
but if he's talking about a supreme
court fact in the supreme court yeah in
the setting of talking about the supreme
court
i would be quite confident that what he
said was accurate
wouldn't
you so
that's just one of the worst things i've
ever heard
you know if if you don't count things
that are violent
that are usually the worst things of
non-violent things that the government's
ever done where nobody got physically
hurt
that might be the worst thing i've ever
heard
that the government literally
consciously discriminated against a
black woman
for political gain
and then nobody and got away with it
i guess that got away with it part
is the disgusting part
i mean i you could almost feel like
like that's the kind of news that makes
your body feel bad doesn't it
like you're like
wait a minute
what country do i live in
i lived through that
you know in my lifetime
in my lifetime
in fairly recent lifetime you know by
historical terms
in my recent lifetime
my own government consciously
discriminated against a black woman
so that they could guess some political
advantage
name one thing that's worse than that
that doesn't involve actually somebody
getting physically hurt
i can't
i can't think of anything
that what would be more
morally
civilly repulsive
based on everything that we've mutually
agreed on
about the world
i don't know you can get more repulsive
than that now i suppose you could you
could explain it away by saying that all
of the nominations have that icky
quality to them i think you're right
i also wonder why we bother uh
vetting these supreme court people
when you already know what way they're
going to vote
if you already know what every candidate
is going to do on every issue or you
think you do
um
yeah i know what's the point i guess
it's good just to make them talk out
loud
so
the current nominee
was asked
uh
what's her last name
brown
katan something catania brown
can somebody put her full name in the
comments for some reason they have writ
jackson
uh something catania jackson i always
remember her middle name because it's
kind of cool
jackson brown jackson brown stop at
well anyway you know you all know who
she is
i love her middle name
uh that's why i like that one of the
things that brock
oh oh that's her middle name
her first name is katanji
is that the coolest first
name i think anybody who has a first
name that cool
goes further in life
don't you think
would you love to have a first name of
katanji if i'm if i'm saying it right
kitanji
that is like the coolest first name
ah just maybe it's just me
anyway she was asked when life begins
and she you know paused and then smiled
and said i don't know
and i think that was the perfect answer
a better answer would be
the supreme court is not asked
to rule on that specifically
and the interesting thing is that she
said she didn't know because she's uh
she's not a biologist
which really
raises the question about
transgender issues doesn't it
if she's saying she doesn't know who's a
man and a woman because you would need a
biologist to tell you
doesn't that tell you it's not a choice
didn't she indicate it's not a choice
because you need a biologist to tell you
if it's a choice it doesn't matter what
your biology is right
am i right
if it's biology
then men are men and women are women
based on reproductive capability in dna
i guess
but if you have to ask a biologist
that that means is biology
if you ask if you have to ask an
ethicist
ethicist
ethicist
who would you ask who would you ask if
it's not biological let's say it's a
preference it's a choice
or i don't know maybe that's the wrong
word not preference or choice
let me let me
let me modify that so i'm not
accidentally insulting the trans
community so if it's not if it's not
biological what would be the other way
to describe it
psychological
i feel like psychological
is somewhat insulting
because that that would suggest that
they're imagining it or something
if it's not biological
it's what identity
maybe
a chosen identity yeah
okay i'll go with identity i think that
that's the cleanest
um
you know and let me back up and say the
same thing that i say on
trans stuff all the time
and i say it about all the woke stuff
but it's more important than the trans
stuff because we're all confused about
the language to use
i'm willing to be as open-minded
as the most open-minded person about
everything call anybody what they want
give them as many rights as they want
but what i ask in return and i'm pretty
serious about this
what i ask in return for my extreme
open-mindedness
is that when i use the wrong language or
say something that sounds accidentally
insulting
you're going to have to put up
with it
right you're going to have to get over
it
because i'm giving you everything i got
everything i got is my best effort and
my most open-minded acceptance of
everybody's choice that's all i got
if you're expecting me also not to use a
wrong word well that's where we fight
okay that's where we fight
we're going to fight about that
but we're not going to fight about you
making your choice to live your life the
way you want to
you know please
please do live your life exactly the way
you want to if it doesn't bother me
but boy
if you get on me about accidentally
using the wrong word then we fight
then we find
all right
i am going to uh make your day a little
bit better
by suggesting you watch a video in which
i'll it's a complete spoiler so i'm
going to tell you what's on the video
and it'll still be worth watching
apparently there was some kind of a tv
game show kind of thing
in which kelly clarkson was competing
with anne hathaway
to see who could start singing a song
based on the first few notes
so the band would start playing a song
and then the two of them would compete
to see who could start belting out the
song first
so
uh you may or may not know that anne
hathaway is an actress and not known as
a singer
so imagine how how
just imagine how
you know
you'd feel she'd be so intimidated
because you competed against literally
kelly clarkson one of the great singers
of our time
and you're not even a professional
singer imagine being in that competition
you have to sing in public
against kelly clarkson
right now that's the setup
now kelly clarkson apparently was behind
because anne hathaway had beaten her on
a few songs already so kelly clarkson
before the next one plays she says you
know laughingly she says you know play a
song i know you know do what i'm
familiar with
so that she can
you know get one right
and the band starts in with just i think
it was just a like a drum beat like
before the sound even started and ann
hathaway recognizes the song first
and steps forward and starts belting it
out
and the funny part was it was kelly
clarkson's uh one of her top hits maybe
your top hit it was kelly clarkson's own
song
and ed hathaway got it from just the the
drum intro
and uh
and kelly clarkson didn't get his
quickly now
so i've given you the whole spoiler
right
so so you think you don't need to watch
the video because i just described it to
you
that's not why i'm telling you to watch
it
here's what you have to see
you have to see anne hathaway
act like a boss
like i've never seen
it is so
freaking well done now keep in mind
she's a professional actress
so she spotted a moment
all right so anne hathaway spotted a
moment
that she could do something really cool
which is basically the way she presented
herself
oh god it was so fun
so the fun part is how confidently
and how quickly anne hathaway stood to
the front and not only did she
win the thing but she belted out the
song
pretty well she actually belted it out
pretty well and kelly clarkson collapses
laughing because she lost on her own our
own head now again i've spoiled the
whole thing but watch how it doesn't
matter
it won't matter to your enjoyment of
watching i guarantee you if you watch
that video
that part of your day will be better
like you'll you'll be happy for like an
hour because it's just so much fun so go
it's on cnn it's everywhere just
just google it
so there's a question about whether
putin should be picked kicked out of the
g20 the 20 big economies that get
together and talk about important things
for the big 20 economies
apparently he has not been kicked out
yet
but might be ian bremmer says don't ban
russia because you need russia in the
g20 but uh only ban them until putin
leaves
um
i say don't ban him
do not ban
putin from the g20 do you know why
because the ukrainians are no doubt
looking for a decapitation strike
and they can get at him easier if he
leaves the kremlin
am i wrong
i'm not recommending it
i i want to be clear because i think you
get booted off of
social media and probably should
if you recommend somebody
kill somebody
probably you need to be kicked off of
social media so i don't recommend it
i'm just saying
that if putin has to leave the kremlin
the ukrainians are going to be looking
for him and and putin is not the only
one looking for a decapitation strike
remember
putin wanted to take down zelinski and
make it make it fast
is there anything that prevents
ukrainians from taking out putin
there's not is there
so don't you think that
that the americans would
well i don't know if americans would
help on that
that's a good question
if america could help ukrainians
assassinate putin either with like let's
say help would be just information
would they do it
i actually don't know the answer to that
question do you
yeah it would be super illegal of course
of course it's illegal it would be more
illegal than just about anything could
be illegal
but
we would have killed hitler
right
am i right
if the allied forces had a chance they
would have killed hitler
i'm not wrong about that
am i
yeah well they didn't kill hitler at the
olympics but maybe that was too early
they thought about it
so i'm going to say that uh anything
that puts
that moves putin out of uh his most
protected situations and into a less
protective situation would be
good
risk management for the rest of the
world
so i would keep him in the g20 just to
expose him
make things interesting
all right although we might just
do a zoom or something instead of going
um
we're seeing stories how many of you
have seen stories about ukraine taking
back territory
sure the russians took some territory
but the ukrainians took it back
and do you believe that
do you believe that the ukrainians are
now turning things around and taking
back territory
i'm going to say no on that
with a caveat
imagine imagine this war
you got all kinds of military units
doing all kinds of things
do you think with all kinds of russian
military units
doing all kinds of missions and things
would there ever be a situation
in which the russian military went in
and took control of something
and then because they don't have
infinite resources
they left
to take in to conquer something else
probably don't you think there are
places where the russian military went
in but then they had to relocate
and when they relocated
then the ukrainians take it back
but what did they take back
just rubble the only thing ukrainians
took back was rubble
the army moved to where they can do some
more damage because there's nothing left
to destroy
so when you hear these stories about you
know
the ukrainians taking back some
territory
number one
it probably just isn't true at all
it probably never happened because
that's most of the reporting out of the
war zone is fake
eighty-five percent probably
uh at least at least of specific little
stories i'd say 85 of them are wrong the
big picture we may or may not know
what's going on generally but the little
anecdotal stuff
85
so i'm gonna say there's probably no
credible evidence
of anything like the ukrainians taking
anything back now
take the same same logic
whatever you say about russian supply
lines
have you noticed that we treat them like
they're all the same
we just say
russian supply lines
what is there one supply line
that goes to all of the units everywhere
in ukraine
they're like spread out over the whole
country
are you telling me that the supply
chains are all about the same
and they're all good
nope
here's what's most likely happening
most likely
russia's main fighting forces are being
resupplied
because they'd have the resources
most likely and by the way i'd like
somebody who has military experience to
jump in here most likely there are also
lesser important russian units
that have been completely cut off from
their supply lines
disagree
would you say that given that so many
different things are happening
there are some russians doing well some
not doing well some have supply lines
some have less supply lines right i mean
that part is just math
you don't you don't have to wonder if
that's happening am i right
we don't need to hear a report
to know that some units are doing better
than others that's that's just sort of
guaranteed of the situation wouldn't you
say
they're not doing equally well
so here's what i predict
in theory
the ukrainians if they can hold off and
it looks like they can hold out for a
while they should be able to isolate
and annihilate
these the the lesser russian units that
are out of
everything
because they're not going to fight back
too much they might just surrender
so i think you're going to see stories
of some kind of an accelerated uh
ukrainian offensive
in which they're mopping up the
the russian units that are the weaker
ones that are
out of resources
who disagrees with that analysis again
i'm not
i don't think i'm
by no means am i presenting myself as a
military expert
you all know that right so i'm only
going to say things
that seem common sense
based on just the whole world and
everything you know about it
there's no way every russian is doing
just as well
in the fighting
there's no way you don't have to be the
military expert to know that right
so i'm getting somebody who says i
totally disagree
so is the part that you disagree with
that all of the units can be uh are are
somewhat equally and well supplied
would that be your assumption
does somebody have an assumption that
all of the russian troops are about
equally well supplied
because if you don't
then i think you agree with me
if there are some that are going to run
out of stuff
the ukrainians are going to target them
and take them out
right
can somebody give me an argument against
that
i'm seeing some people disagreeing but i
don't see any i don't see any pushback
yeah
yeah probably the russians in the south
are resupplied
probably in the north is more of a
problem especially for the smaller
groups
you know anybody who got off who moved
away from the main supply
line you channels
they're probably in trouble
all right
somebody says a little botulism goes a
long way
do you think the ukrainians are going to
poison
is that legal
suppose suppose the ukrainians uh took
over a food truck on its way or you know
food supply truck on its way to the uh
russian soldiers suppose they put a
ukrainian like a fake ukrainian in the
driver's seat and they deliver the truck
acting like it's just a regular delivery
and then suppose
that that truck had food in it that
wasn't so good let's say it doesn't kill
anybody but makes them incapacitated
there's a lot of stuff you could do to a
to uh army that has a weak supply line
um
so russia seems is uh relying on
distance weapons so shooting things from
a great distance apparently they're
shooting things from their warships
into the southern part of ukraine
now here's a question for me
how well protected are those russian
warships
that have
that are shooting from a great distance
i don't know 20 miles could somebody
give me a distance
at what distance
would the
russian navy be firing
20 miles
somebody knows that come on you know
that
somebody says hundreds i see 20.
now i'm not talking about a cruise
missile talking about just
regular
kinetic weapons
so he says 50 depending on the missiles
well
are we talking about missiles i guess
they are missiles aren't they
i was thinking it was artillery but it's
probably missiles isn't it
is it both
uh cannons 10 kilometers at most okay
so here's the question can the
ukrainians really not reach those ships
the ukrainians don't have any kind of
small boats with
hand-held anti-ship or you know shoulder
mounted
they can't get a small craft to go out
there that are you know maybe too many
of them for the boats i mean if
you wouldn't want one motorboat with a
with a missile on it because they could
probably see that and blow it out of the
water but suppose you had lots of them
suppose you had 25 little boats
that went out there and they all had
shoulder-mounted missiles and they
took a crack at whatever ships are out
there
uh russia controls the whole sea
well nobody controls a whole sea
oh support helicopters keeping them down
yeah
and what about
uh let me ask this are you telling me
that the united states doesn't make a
torpedo
that you can release from the shore
see what i'm saying
are you telling me
that the united states doesn't have
anywhere in its weapon systems
a torpedo that you can release from
shore or maybe you take a boat out and
you know you're you're just
not far out
that would have a guidance system on it
a guidance system
that would just take that
bomb based on let's say satellite
maybe satellite
navigation
torpedoes are huge and heavy
would it have to be missiles
french exo set all right so i guess
i guess this was what i'm asking are
those russian boats gonna blow up
and why not are the ukrainians even
trying to take a crack at them or is
that too much of an escalation that
might be too much of an escalation if
you sank a
a russian warship
oh there's an airplane oh yeah an
airplane dropping a torpedo i just saw a
picture of it so even it looks like even
in world war
what the hell world war was that a
biplane with a dropping a torpedo okay
i'm not quite connecting those
technologies that looks like two
different technology eras
a biplane with a torpedo
they have torpedoes in world war one
that they could drop from a plane
yeah maybe
um
too much in the weeds here can we talk
about trump
um well
you know everything is tied to ukraine
at the moment
but it does suggest if russians using
distance weapons it suggests that the
ukrainians have better weapons for the
defense than the offenders than the
offense
has here's my further prediction you
ready for this
so this is really confirming or
doubling down on a prediction i made
before
putin invaded
and i said that there might be some
high-tech weaponry that the ukrainians
have
that we've never even seen
and it's starting to feel like that
although i'm not certain you couldn't
conclude from what we've seen it could
be
that the weapons we know exist you know
the the shoulder mounted rockets etc it
could be
that that's exactly all they needed to
hold off the russians for now
but
aeromarine 700
yeah you'd think there would be a robot
submarine by now
they could just go destroy a warship
anywhere
anyway um
now
i think i forgot my point there
uh oh the point is that i predict that
we'll find out that the ukrainians used
uh some weapons we'd never heard of
how many people want to take the other
side of that bet
that when it's all over maybe not during
the fighting but when it's all over
there will be stories to say you know
it's a good thing that the americans let
the ukrainian defenders use the
drone 600
because it could do whatever
it's going to be something somebody says
a few years maybe a few years but i feel
like
i feel like there's something going on
weapon wise that we don't exactly know
could be small drones
if you have enough of them yeah the
switchblade drones it could be the
switchblade drones but we don't know how
many they have
um we've seen the ukrainians say how
many losses the russians have had and
they've got big charts of all the tanks
and
troops and stuff but everything of
course is
sketchy
so here's the question when i when i was
a commercial
loaning officer for a bank
and i would review
loan requests
and the person usually an entrepreneur
entrepreneur or business person would
say
my expenses
will be x and my revenue will be x for
this first year
so therefore give me a loan
now the first thing you do if you're a
loan
analyzer
is you
take what they say they're going to make
and you divide it by
give me a number
you take the entrepreneur's income
that's they optimistically say and then
you divide it by
i see some experienced people here
at least to two or three
at least two or three and three is
smarter
right
i'm surprised how many of you knew that
yeah so yeah cutting it by 50 or more
would be standard now what do you do
with the expenses
the expenses you you raise because no
entrepreneur has ever
accurately estimated their expenses
they're always low and the reason
they're low is that you can't estimate
an expense
for something you don't anticipate
and the world is full of things you
can't anticipate
so yeah usually you double the expenses
cut the revenue by third and if it still
makes sense well maybe then you get the
loan
but but you would never give somebody a
loan based on their own estimates
everybody know that
you would never grant a loan
based on the customer's own estimates of
what what's going to happen that would
just be dom
so when we see the russian losses as
reported by the ukrainians we know
they're exaggerated of course because
it's war and it's propaganda
but what is the factor of
of exaggeration
it's at least three
when you say
it might be five
but it could be ten
i doubt it's ten i'm going to guess five
right because you would exaggerate at
the most that you could exaggerate and
think you could get away with it
and so i
just commonsensically i think you could
triple the number of losses
given that fog of war and the difficulty
of confirming anything i think you could
triple the actual losses and get away
with it so my best guess is if you're
trying to look at the ukrainians claims
i would divide them by three
roughly
does that sound about right to all of
you
take their claims divide by three it
might be more than that you might maybe
have to divide by five but just as a
starting point to get you in the the
general area that's about right
all right
um
there's a movie coming out i think on
amazon prime
by
musical artist lizzo
do you all know lizzo
now the important part of the story and
we don't do fat shaming
so we will tolerate no fat shaming
but she is a large woman
uh i don't know what she weighs looks
about 300 pounds or something so she's a
very large black woman the black part is
irrelevant to the story
i'm throwing it in just so you can like
have an image in your mind
um
and one of the things she's doing is i'm
going to say it's interesting before i
put an opinion on it
she is um
let's say maybe celebrating or embracing
her size
and she does a lot of dancing and skimpy
outfits um
and she's quite active she's she's
interestingly
physically capable for for her size now
her movie involves
auditioning other uh women roughly her
size not all of them i guess but
choosing dancers for some kind of a
event
uh and then putting together this dance
thing that's
a number of the women are roughly the
same size as lizzo now
i commented that
the the fact that this movie exists
tells you everything about 2022 in
one
one movie
it's sort of everything you need to know
about our current time
i mean i could go down the list but you
could do it just as well in your head
okay you've got everything there
it's like the full
woke
smorgasborg
and
nothing is more obvious than the fact
that i can't talk my my actual opinion
about this situation
am i right
if i gave you just my actual honest
opinion
i'd probably be banned from social media
which is also a perfect 2022 thing
however
i'm just going to say
that celebrating um
lifestyles which appear to me in my
non-medically trained
opinion
to be unhealthy
is maybe not a super good trend for
society
on the other hand
i do kind of like that there's a
counterbalance
to the idea that everybody needs to be a
real thin
you know i'm a big a big proponent of
managing your weight and your fitness
and stuff but i'm also realistic right
we don't live in a world where
everybody's going to be nailing that
stuff
so i do think
i do think that if you were just looking
at it from a health perspective which is
a reasonably objective way to do it
it might be sending the wrong message
might be sending the wrong message
so i don't think it's optimal but i also
live in a world where i like free
expression
so um i do not think
uh
i don't think you should be banned or
discouraged
other than you know talking to your own
family perhaps but
uh
yeah it looks like it looks like it's
seriously
bad for society but
free speech
i also suspect it will be a huge hit
does anybody want to take that bet
i think this will be a huge hit i feel
like i have to watch it
and i i desperately don't want to watch
this in fact i can't think of anything i
less want to watch
you know and i don't even like movies in
general and i this would be at the
bottom of my movie list
but i feel like i'm still gonna have to
watch it
just because
it's such a
culturally significant thing in some way
and i love the fact that lizzo's
marketing
is so effective
she is kind of a genius
in marketing or she has help or
something
yeah
all right so uh trump decided that he
wasn't going to
back mo brooks
for the senate
and the reason is that brooks did not
support uh trump in saying that the 2020
election was rigged mo brooks said he
wanted to put it in the rearview mirror
he said it seven months ago but trump
has a long memory
and he decided today that he's going to
unendorse him
i don't know will that make a difference
it could right and that could be the
difference between getting elected and
not elected
but
uh i've often described this and every
time i see it it's worth reminding you
the trump technique for persuasion
is twice as strong as everybody else's
technique
it's twice as strong it's because he
does two paths at once
he makes it really good to do what he
what you want because he'll praise you
and promote you you know at least you
know give you attention and stuff if you
do what he wants
so that part most people will do
so most people will say yeah if you do
what i want all
i'll say good things about you so so far
he does everything that everybody else
would do but then the other thing he
does that you don't do
is that he makes sure that he publicly
executes anybody who doesn't do what he
wants
i mean that hyperbolically so moe brooks
is sort of being publicly executed
and the point has nothing to do with mo
brooks
the point is do you want to mess with
trump
because if because if you go against
them and this is a fairly
insignificant
crime that mo brooks did which is just
disagree with him on how to how to treat
the election it's not even clear that mo
brooks disagrees with them on the facts
i mean i don't know that mo brooks
thinks the election was
rigged or not rigged
but he wasn't even talking about that he
was just saying strategically we should
let it go and put it in the rear view
mirror
and that
that alone
just disagreeing with trump
got him unendorsed and he might lose his
job so you see why i say he's twice as
persuasive
everybody does the things where you
compliment somebody doing what you like
but very few people will take you out
and execute you in the courtyard in
front of everybody
again
not literally
very few people will do that
that's what trump does
uh we should never let it go trump is
right on this
you might be
you might be right you know trump is
trump is feeling more right than ever
because now we know that the hunter
laptop story was
suppressed to change the election result
his claim that the election was rigged
is now actually supported by the new
york times
his other claims that there were
irregularities in the voting itself
i don't know where that is honestly
i i do not have a sense
if any of those claims are holding up or
should hold up i don't know
it's hard to trust any of it really
because most of the claims 95 of them
have been pure so we don't know
i do think
there is no
possible physical logical way
that 50 states could be running
perfectly fair elections
let me just say it this way without
i'll just describe the situation
we live in a world in which everybody is
lying and cheating about everything
are you with me so far
will you will you accept my starting
assumption
that every expert
and every official in every capacity
is
non-credible
so
why would we think that 50 individual
states
each of them individually running their
election
can you tell me that you feel
that in the context where every other
organization from the cdc to the
presidency to our intelligence agencies
to all of our experts
have intentionally and consistently lied
to us about everything
so why would you believe that 50 states
could hold an election without an
irregularity that mattered
really
let's try the really test
so in 2022 in a world where we have
confirmed this is not speculation
we've confirmed
that everybody who has any kind of
responsibility or expertise has lied to
us
confirmed
and yet
all 50 states ran a good capable
fair election without fraud that was
significant
really
really
this is this is the one time where math
doesn't work
where human nature
decided to take a vacation
this is the only situation
where human nature
didn't apply
every year
every election
all 50 states
they're all nailing it
really
the only thing that's working right in
this country is 50 separate groups
independently coming up with their own
processes
and running their own independent
elections
everything else in the whole world is
 up
everything
everything in the whole world is
up
not working
lying
and broken
but hey
we got 50 individual state elections
with no significant problems
really
really
are you kidding me
there's no chance that that's true
am i right
what evidence do i have
none
because our system guarantees we can't
get the evidence
if you have a system and the only thing
you heard about it is you can't audit it
but it's really important
that your money's at stake and
you know just there's a lot of stake
high stakes and you can't audit whether
it's working as planned
and there are 50 of them
not even i'm not even talking about an
election oh you thought i was talking
about an election no it's just an
example
just an example it's a generic situation
not about an election
in which everybody in the whole
world is lying to you but all the states
are good they're all good
that's what we've been told and we are
so sheep like we rolled over and just
said
election's good
it's the only thing that works
i won't get banned from social media for
saying this
do you know why
because this is the argument you don't
want anybody to hear
that's what protects me on social media
in this specific case
i am protected from being banned because
if i get banned for saying that
that's going to be a story
am i right
if i got banned for saying we that the
elections are weirdly the only thing
that worked right
and everybody heard that story do you
think the democrats want people thinking
that way
that it's it's plainly ridiculous
to imagine that an unaudited system run
by 50 entities is the only thing
in the world that works right it's not
it's not the only thing in the
world that works right we just don't
know what's wrong with it because we're
not allowed to look
at least in any detail that we would
like to look
well i wasn't planning on that
rant but it came out anyway
um and that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to
the time at which
my youtube audience may have to go do
something else
but i think you can agree it was the
best live stream you've ever seen in
your entire existence
and possibly some other dimensions that
we're not aware of
and so ladies and gentlemen
and
according to ron desantis's calculation
that includes everybody
i would like to wish you
a good day
