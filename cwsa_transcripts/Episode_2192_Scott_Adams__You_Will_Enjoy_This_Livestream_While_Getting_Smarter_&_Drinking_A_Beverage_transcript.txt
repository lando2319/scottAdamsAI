oh
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
and probably Ai and lots of other
planets too if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels which nobody in
the universe could ever imagine well
it's easy all you need is a copper mug
or a glass a tiger Chelsea's diet again
teen Joker flask a vessel of any guide
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine for
today the thing that makes everything
better is called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
quite good
quite good
I think everything's going to be better
after that sip
well let me catch up catch you up with
all the exciting news are you ready for
this
uh well it turns out the Zuckerberg
versus musk fight or the as a muscles it
Zuck versus Musk what are the odds that
those two billionaires would both have a
u in their name
just I don't know for some reason that
strikes me as weird
way that fight looks like it might
actually happen it's not a hundred
percent confirmed but they've all said
yes and uh most says it'll be streamed
on x
the the
ex-twitter platform called X
oh wow
it's an X Twitter platform called X
everything's weird today
it's probably me
so that's going to happen and you'll get
to see that I can't imagine that you
know I'm sure Facebook would would do
the same all right today's theme
and I do have a theme
do you like my shows where I have a
theme or is that is that just for me
all right we'll go private on locals I
always just assuming it's just me but
here's the theme
you'll be fine
you'll be fine
here's the overall theme does it seem
like you wake up every day and the
world's falling apart and and politics
is going to cause a Civil War and all
that
I don't know it's been like that my
entire life
I actually don't remember any time in my
life when it wasn't exactly like that
the Vietnam War was going to kill me in
the Communists were going to Nuke me in
the atmosphere was going to fry and the
world was going to freeze and we were
going to run out of oil and run out of
food and
[Music]
China was going to destroy us and that's
only if Japan didn't do it first with
our Superior Technology and
Manufacturing
so basically
what would be different about our
current set of problems
really nothing
it's basically more of the same which is
stuff that humans are pretty good at
getting past
pretty good
so I think it would be fine and no
matter how bad things are remember that
the business model of the media is to
scare the out of you that's how
they make money
so if you read media reports and you
found yourself getting anxious and
scared that's what they were trying to
do
is somewhat independent of what's
actually happening in the world
your whatever reactions you're having to
world events are because of the way
they're being presented to you it's not
the actual events in most cases those
things will be fine yeah we'll work it
out now there is one thing that still
worries me which is debt
I don't have a clean answer to debt but
I'd like to give you the most optimistic
take you've ever heard
this is so optimistic
if you call those stupid I probably
wouldn't push back too hard
but it's really optimistic you ready
that the combination of the following
Technologies is going to make debt
disappear
in other words we could owe a hundred
trillion dollars
but there'll be a day when everybody
looks to each other and says we don't
really need money
and the debts will all go away and so
whoever has the largest debt
when money becomes obsolete will be the
winner because they got all that free
use of money
and then when money was worthless to
everybody their debt went away now you
say to me Scott that's stupid
that will never go away how could that
go away I mean without paying it off how
can it go away and the answer is
a combination of AI
robots
superconductivity
Fusion
and time
and all of those are happening
right time of course always is happening
but if you give it enough time AI plus
robots plus superconductivity plus
Fusion gives you unlimited labor and
energy
and you say no but but Scott you know
there's going to be a limit to how many
robots there are
not in the long run
in the long run robots will build other
robots
and they'll have free energy to do it
and then when robots can build other
robots there's really no limit to how
many robots there are you say but wait
they'll run out of raw materials
no robots will be building they'll be
looking for raw materials they'll be
mining they'll be digging it up and then
AI will figure out cheaper better ways
to do it so they'll get more and more
efficient and then you say to yourself
but hold on Scott there will still be
scarcity in the world as long as there's
scarcity of anything that people want
you're going to have to have some money
to negotiate who gets and who doesn't
right
and I saw the best example the camera
argument was who decides who gets the
beach house
in your your world with no money Scott
who gets the beach house
well same as today Whoever has the best
weapons
that's the way it'll always be Whoever
has the most control of a Weaponry we'll
have the beach house
now I don't know if that changes when
money doesn't uh you know because if you
think about it the only reason that rich
people have a beach house is because you
can't go there and kill them and take
their beach house
and why can't you because the rich
people control the government the
government controls the military and the
police military and police will keep you
the hell out of the rich people's house
right so whoever has the best weapons
gets the beach house that's one answer
here's another answer
every place will be a good location
so if you're thinking yourself but wait
everybody's gonna want the good location
now every place will be a good location
once once the robots are building
anything you don't have to worry the AI
is designing things
you'll live in it you'll live in a city
that's so awesome you'll feel so good
all the time
that you won't care if you're at the
beach or not
I mean how often are you actually
looking out the window anyway right so
if you make everything every place
amazing
it doesn't matter who has the beach
house and maybe the people in the beach
house will say you know what I'm getting
a little tired of the beach how about
you guys you want to use it for a
weekend I think you would that things
would end up working out
in the long long run
so I'll just put that out there it takes
a lot of thinking through the details of
how it could possibly be that money
would become obsolete but I almost
guarantee it
in the long run
would anybody would take the opposite
side of that bet maybe not in my
lifetime but in the long run do you
think money will still be a thing
remember money only has a value when
there is scarcity
so the argument is entirely about can
you make everything
abundant or at least people don't care
about their choices that would be the
same as abundance you don't need
abundance
if you can change what people care about
they just don't care about that beach
house it's out of the sound of the
equation
all right
enough about that
I just thought I'd give you a little
optimism
um and uh LK 99 which is that alleged
superconductivity thing uh every day I
open Twitter
and say to myself it's not called
Twitter it's called X and then I look at
the content after I say that's myself
and then I I see what's new in
superconductivity because really that's
the key to everything I just said
if if in fact there's room temperature
superaconda super conductivity then your
AI and your Fusion everything just works
basically everything would be completely
different
you know I look at I look at the reports
and I can't tell
I I don't actually don't even have
um a 51 feeling about whether this is
real or not does anybody else have a
does anybody have confidence about it
one way or the other
it to me it looks like an absolute coin
flip
honestly if I had to bet
I would bet against it
so I guess I do have a 51 if I had to
bet
I'd bet against it I hate to say that
what do you think
the things I've seen are so obviously
fraudulent
then it makes me wonder if anything
isn't
but the fact that many of the videos are
fraudulent and somewhat obviously so I
would say
um
that doesn't mean it's not real
but I'm leaning against it
so but not but not strongly so let me
say this in advance if I get this one
wrong I'll be the happiest wrong guy
ever
because I'd really like to be wrong
about this
but I feel like probably it's not and
when I say it's not real let me put some
Nuance on that not real in a way that it
could be commercialized
so it might be real in some technical
sense that works in the lab but I'm
going to bet against it being something
that could ramp up
51 percent
uh Ford has allegedly
submitted a patent for a
self-repossessing car if you don't pay
your uh
you pay your payments and the it has a
very clever system
uh anyway it's not it's not issued it's
just submitted for a patent and it would
do things like um
decrease the services of the car
over time so let's say you didn't pay
your payments and you missed a few
months
they would turn off your air
conditioning
huh
doesn't that
dockle they would turn off your air
conditioner the car would still work you
could still get to work but you better
be thinking about making that payment
because it's going to get hot it's just
gonna get hot
and then apparently there are other
elements of the car they could turn off
I imagine they could turn off your
stereo system
but the coolest part is if it becomes a
self-driving car
they can have the Dr the car drive to a
different location on its own
so for example they might have it pull
out of your driveway you know drive to a
parking lot where they can pick it up
but this reminds me of uh do you
remember uh big car was that the show it
was a TV show where they had a special
car that they would leave unlocked for
people to steal but once they got in the
car the the doors would lock and then
the show was about what happens once
they're in the car they can't get out
and they know they're going to get
caught in the bait car
I love that show I could watch that all
day long
but yeah anyway so maybe something like
that's happened all right here's my uh
thinker for the day
you will disagree with this
but the longer you think about it
the better it sounds all right so I'm
going to acknowledge that your first
exposure to this will be well that can't
be true okay
so that's the challenge it'll sound bad
when you hear it it'll sound better
every day you're alive
the person with the best idea is always
in charge
the person with the best idea
is always in charge
it will take you decades to learn that
in your real life
decades
now it sounds stupid doesn't it this is
your your first impression of that is
wait a minute wait a minute I'll give
you some pushback I got just on Twitter
today
somebody said what about Stalin
what about Stalin was that a bunch of
good ideas
Stalin seemed to be in charge
and uh that didn't seem like a bunch of
good ideas did it
is that a good argument
no because here's what I didn't say I
didn't say the person with the best idea
couldn't be shot
I didn't say that they're Bulletproof
right that nothing I said is about the
person with the best idea being
Bulletproof
you can still kill them
Stalin probably killed a lot of them
so you have to be alive
in order to be in charge
so that's the first thing if you're not
alive or you're in jail that doesn't
work
um but you also have to assert yourself
having the best idea and not telling
anybody
well that's not going to help that
doesn't put you in charge
but suppose you have the best idea and
this was another bit of pushback but it
can't be well described
is that does that violate my my point
that the person with the best ideas in
charge when that best idea is just too
hard to describe
so therefore maybe not because I can't
communicate it right
I say
not true
I say the best idea is always
able to be communicated
I mean maybe indirectly maybe you're bad
at communicating so you tell another
scientist the scientist understands and
then the scientist communicates it but
the best idea is going to Bubble Up
maybe not on day one
but over time
so
here's the inspirational part of that if
you're in the room
and you have the best idea
you are effectively in charge and you're
going to find that over and over again
because the person whose job it is on
paper to be the boss
really doesn't want to make all the
decisions they want a solution
and so if you have the best idea they're
going to say okay do that they'll
probably make you do it but the best
idea does always win
now you're saying to yourself Scott I
know that's not true because there was
that time I had the best idea I
communicated it clearly and nobody was
buying it
it wasn't the best idea
I know that's hard to accept
but if it had been it would have
actually won the day if not then
eventually
so
I know you your brain doesn't want to
accept this I know it doesn't want to
accept it but let me give you a little
bit of comfort
it doesn't have to be a hundred percent
true
okay it doesn't have to be 100 true it
doesn't have to be true in every
exception in every case it's just one of
those things that if you reframe your
situation this is one of the reframes in
my upcoming book you're going to see
pretty soon
the reframe is to believe that if you
have the best idea you're in charge
if it's not technically 100 True every
time
it still works as a brief rate because
you should be acting as though you're in
charge if you have the best idea you
should just assume it and act that way
it'll it'll work out for you
all right it doesn't mean you win every
every situation
um I noticed that Joe Rogan was uh going
in hard at politics and I thought it was
almost jarring did anybody have the same
experience
that uh Rogan being you know at this
point I think you could easily say the
most influential
independent podcaster do we call him
independent if he's working with Spotify
I don't know what the definition would
be there but he seems independent I mean
I don't think that they control what he
says
so
are we happy about this
are you happy that Joe Rogan is going in
strong because he's saying directly that
Biden is incompetent uh Trump had some
good things going for him
and lots of complaints about Newsome
called Newsom a cardboard cutout
you know criticize him for mandating
vaccinations for children
criticizing the the science and the
scientists and all that
I guess I'm happy about it on the other
hand
um
you want to make sure he's right
and it's not good if it's not right but
um he does seem to be right more than
he's wrong
has anybody noticed that one of the
Great Tricks of Joe Rogan
is to lull you into thinking he's not
that smart
when in fact the uh very much the
opposite is true he's one of the
smartest people in all of media and his
success isn't is not some kind of weird
accident
he didn't get lucky
there's no there's no luck involved in
the whole story he was just really smart
and just worked hard and did all the
right things now he's in the right place
yeah you know
um I think that he's an example of the
internet dads stepping up
so it's it's a good uh it's a good Trend
I'd like to see more voices like his
you know take responsibility for the
fact that people are listening so he's
taking it pretty seriously I like that
all right here's a test of your media
savvy media Savvy tests
uh Jamie Foxx actor Jamie Foxx is being
accused of posting something
anti-semitic on Instagram that's all you
know
is it a true story or a fake story
I mean the story is in the news for real
but did it really happen or did it or is
it just
it's do you know do you know
how you know
because it's a jaw-dropping story about
a public figure
jaw-dropping stories about public
figures pretty much never true
there isn't so interesting
is because nobody would act like that
and indeed he did not did he say
something that bad people could take out
of context of course
you know that's just every day
all right here's another one same test
Jennifer Aniston is accused of doing
something online that people say is
anti-Semitic did it really happen
is it real no of course not of course
not it's actually somebody accused her
of liking the thing that Jamie Foxx did
that wasn't interpreted correctly right
so you know social media buzzing about
those
now I saw some pushback going by and I
would like to agree with you on this
I can't really explain Mel Gibson
you know except that uh probably alcohol
is part of the
part of the answer but that doesn't
doesn't change what came out of his
mouth so there are some cases where
maybe maybe things are exactly what they
look like
maybe maybe sometimes it's just what you
think but if you bet in that direction
you're going to be wrong a lot
right I don't know if it's ninety
percent of the time that the news about
public figures is wrong and by the way
I don't know for 100 sure that the story
is about Mel Gibson are correct
the kind of thing they are but I don't
know I don't know
so
just keep in mind the stories about
public figures usually fake all right
here's a tougher one
there's a biographer of Obama and this
is New York posters writing about this
so This Obama biographer I think he had
a 2017 book
and he makes the following claims based
on his research of Obama
that Obama uh people don't realize that
but he's as insecure As Trump
so the Obama biographer somebody who
spent eight hours interviewing him
talked to lots of people says that Obama
is in as insecure As Trump
you can now discount everything else
that biographer says as ridiculous
what is he a mind reader
is there some objective scale where you
can compare two people two people that
maybe even you don't even know one of
them and you could tell which one's more
insecure
how patently ridiculous that you can
read Obama's mind
completely ridiculous
all right uh what else you said that
it's clear that Obama doesn't care about
rebuilding the Democratic party as an
institution
really because what he said that no
he he uh has a mind and his mind was
read probably it's just mind reading
well you should not believe anybody who
talks like this about another person you
don't know what people are thinking you
don't know what level of anxiety they
have about anything and you don't know
how it compares to some other stranger
these are ridiculous things to say never
never talk like this
um and then he's got
um some story about Obama writing a
letter to his girlfriend saying he had
um fantasies about sex with men
now
let me ask you this
first of all I don't think that means
anything
um imagine if all your secret thoughts
were available to the world
how would you look
let me just think about it suppose
people had access to your like private
all of your private conversations
forever private conversations between
lovers ex-lovers suppose I had all of
that
how would you look
do you think anything any of that would
be a little surprising to other people
and more importantly
what's wrong with thinking about stuff
I don't care what Obama thought about
why do we care what he thought about
he had thoughts
well first of all I don't care if he
acted on those thoughts that it
shouldn't be relevant in any way but
we're not even talking about what he did
we're only talking about a conversation
of something he thought about
oh my God
uh don't be this guy
all right
um Jonathan Charlie can continues to be
the most fun and interesting voice uh I
would say also with uh Joel Pollock the
two what I would listen to the most on
all this uh legal stuff with Trump
and the Biden stuff as well those are
two people you should absolutely be
following and reading
during the current news cycle especially
all right
so here's something that uh totally says
he says uh this case talking about
charges against Trump which criminally
targets the sitting president it's a
leading up opponent is much more
dangerous because it sets up the federal
government as the Arbiter of Truth
this indictment essentially charges
Trump with not accepting the quote truth
now that that's a really
clean way to express what's going on
right there are a lot of a lot of
Windows to look into here but this one's
this was pretty important uh yeah we are
we're on the cusp of accepting that your
government can tell you what the truth
is and if you say things opposite of
that you might get in trouble maybe for
something related to it like how people
acted because of what you said you know
so that they can make it look like it's
not the speech though was the thing oh
it's not what you said no no you've got
oh free speech of course but what you
said was untrue and therefore people
acted on it and you know bad things
happened
but we can't really have a civilization
on that rule because we're always acting
on bad ideas and bad opinions and yeah
you couldn't really have
any kind of a system that that worked
that way
so that's a good point I like the way
you're saying it but I did have
something I disagreed with
this might be the first time I disagree
with Jonathan Turley
on the following point he thought it was
unwise in you know I'm paraphrasing for
him so these are my words I guess he
thought it was unwise for Trump to make
his threatening sounding uh truths
um you know a effectively a tweet on
Truth
um and that's saying that if you come
for me I'll come for you and that wasn't
helpful
and
do you agree with that
do you agree that that that worked
against his uh legal
strategy
here's where I disagree
I do not believe
um that Jonathan Turley and I have the
same opinion of what Trump's likely
strategy is now remember we can't read
his mind
so here Here Charlie and I are operating
you know both blind
I don't know what Trump's thinking but I
know that Charlie doesn't agree right
nobody knows what he's thinking we know
what he's doing
but what we watch him doing is
threatening the system in a way that
your common sense and your history and
your sense of right and wrong says
should not be happening
but here's where I different I differ
with Hurley I don't think Trump is
trying to win his case
only
only so only is the the key word I don't
think Trump is trying to win his his
legal cases only
he's he's going after the whole system
he's trying to tear down the whole
system
and if you're trying to tear down the
whole system this is the way to do it
you you should say directly what you're
going to do yes this is a Witch Hunt
if if you if you push this Witch Hunt
I'm coming for you
that's exactly what his supporters want
in a legal non-violent way right we're
we're all talking non-violent here
but certainly in a legal sense certainly
in a political sense you'd want him to
come as hard as he could you'd want him
maybe if you're a supporter you would
say you want to take over and fire the
entire management of everything that's
looking rotten at the moment
so
um I would agree If This Were a normal
defendant in a normal situation that he
should not be attacking the system you
know he should work within it and try to
get his best result by keeping his mouth
shut but this is the furthest you could
be from a normal situation
Trump is probably the only person
that I would say yeah he should attack
the whole system
he should go after the judge he should
go you know even even ahead of time he's
the only person I would say this about
but he should go after the system
because if he does a good enough job in
making the system look as corrupt as it
apparently is
then it will be impossible for him to be
to be uh prosecuted
because there might be a case that he's
broken technical you know there might be
technical violations
but
if the way the law goes is that it the
law accurately pursues the technical
violations and that ends up taking him
off the field for the for the election
nobody's going to be at well half the
country will be happy about it but his
supporters are not going to be happy and
that's not a country you're going to
want to live in it's going to get
pretty unhappy so I think in his
specific case when everybody can see
it's a political prosecution in the
context of a political prosecution
against a likely number one or two
finisher in the in the end uh he should
go after the whole system
so I believe that he's playing it right
now I I don't predict it's going to go
well
you know who knows a million things
could happen some people are already
suggesting that Trump should negotiate
a pardon for not running
what would you think had happened if if
Trump I think scaramucci was saying this
how yeah okay I see the reaction already
if Trump negotiates his own freedom
in return for not running
uh
I can't even explain what that would do
to me like my brain I don't even know
what I do about that but that would be
the worst case scenario in my opinion
that's the worst case scenario
because if if Trump rolls over
we're lost it just means everybody will
roll over yeah you like to think that
there's somebody who's going to take it
to the mat and it feels like it's them
it feels like Trump is just going to
take it as far as you need to take it
and the the Democrats need to know
that he's not going to stop because he
might get killed
right I mean either politically or
financially or even physically
if Trump
puts up enough of a scare which is his
specialty right his specialty is scaring
the other side you don't know what I'll
do I'm unpredictable and he's definitely
playing out that strategy and I think
well
he's creating a situation where finding
him guilty even if there is a tactical
guilt
is dangerous
and I think that's actually the healthy
situation
it should look dangerous
would you agree
the safest the safest situation for the
country is if everybody's transparent
about where the red line is
right if you if your gray area that's
where you get trouble I think I can push
him a little here well okay he got away
with it I think I'll push him a little
bit Yeah there's got to be a limit
and both sides need to know where the
other's limit is so communicating where
the limit is
is just good government I think and I
think I think Trump's doing it
in a way that no lawyer would advise but
it might be good for the system
all right let's see if you can recognize
this pattern of Deceit
um let's call this a disinformation play
um and this is the Democrat processes
are now becoming clear
you know I keep saying that you can see
the Machinery now
so see if this sounds familiar
uh it's a combination of these plays the
Russian disinformation play that you saw
with the laptop
the cat on the roof play
where there's bad news but instead of
just admitting it they just trickle it
out well well the cats of the tree can't
get it out and well it's on the roof and
then later it dies getting off the roof
right so it's the slow the slow cabinet
roof and then what about the play of
getting the media to cover for you like
the the lying media the ones that you
know are the designated Liars all right
um so and then if you were going to get
the media to lie for you would you get
The Usual Suspects you get the
Washington Post
you get Politico right if you want to
cover cover a Democrat lie you'd ask
them
all right so that's we know the play is
so let's see if it got applied here we
just learned that Devon Archer is
confirmed that a dinner that Hunter was
at Hunter Biden with his business
associates was in fact attended
by Joe Biden
a say it was Russian distance
they did they said it was Russian
disinformation
it sounds familiar now you can start to
recognize you start to recognize the
play Russia collusion laptop uh Joe
Biden wasn't at this dinner with those
business partners no that's Russia
disinformation I think that actually
came from one of the White House staff
and then once you got that going
um and and so the current news this is
also from Turley
you really have to be reading Charlie
you're you you're going to miss
everything if you're not reading them in
the in these coming weeks
um that we know that Joe Biden not only
attended
but that he attended in a meaningful way
in other words in other words he sat
there he met everybody he talked with
everybody it was the actual dinner
but then came the so after the Russian
disinformation play as things trickled
out they did the cat in the roof
and they said oh oh we said he didn't
attend the dinner
yeah we we didn't say he didn't say hi
yeah yeah he did he did a drive-by you
said hi to I don't know maybe one or two
people and then he just you know left
and then it was well he did more than
say hi okay he he did there was a little
bit of interaction yes
and then it was okay he did sit down
he sat down for a little while
and then it turned into yeah he came
there intentionally knowing everybody
who was there
sat for dinner it was exactly what you
thought it was
and then did they have The Usual
Suspects covering yes Politico and
Washington Post
so now that you see the machinery
once you are once you recognize the
machinery
you can see it
because I and and probably the best tell
somebody said this last night on live
stream
one of the most useful things I've
taught you is designated Liars
does everybody know who the designated
Liars are
if the Democrats bring out
you know Schiff swallow Clapper and
Brandon
that's an OP
that's not news that's an up and now now
uh you know Goldman Goldman seems to
have joined that
um those are the ones who apparently
will say anything
so when they when they know they've got
a losing hand in other words the facts
are against them they bring out the
designated Liars
but the media is also designated Liars
you know you've got your Washington Post
opinion people and your uh your Politico
opinion people right so there's some
entities that once you see it you can't
unsee it
it's like oh designated Liars I got it
this is not real
it's very it's very consistent once the
designated Liars are turned out when uh
what about when you see Bernstein come
on CNN to say something's worse than
Watergate what is the signal the signal
is is that it's made up
that whatever he's mad at is worse than
Watergate probably didn't even happen
probably didn't even happen
all right so learning to recognize the
pattern uh the vague
said and this is an NBC news report
and I'm just going to read it because
the exact wording really matters the and
this is really interesting I promise you
this is interesting so Vivek ramaswamy
uh according to LBC news he implied
Saturday that American involvement in
the war in Ukraine may be because of
President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden
whoa
whoa
um and he said
quote the purpose of the U.S military is
to advance American interests to protect
the Homeland not to aimlessly fight some
random War that's arguably a repayment
for a private bribe that a family member
of the United States received
five million dollars from barisma
said ramaswamy speaking in Iowa
quote he goes on was the payment to
Andrew Biden corrupt absolutely it was
do I think that it has some relationship
toward our posture toward Ukraine
I think it's likely that it does
ramaswamy said
have I mentioned that he's good at
making news
he is the best
the best the best
campaigner you've ever seen now Trump is
a special case right because Trump came
on the scene already famous
but to do what Rama Swami is doing where
that was starting as being famous I mean
he had some exposure from his book but
it's just incredible how much how much
he's hitting I mean he's hitting like
Line Drive Tribbles every day
it's like boom triple boom triple
um so let me talk about this for a
minute
the way he states it is proper which is
that there's some doubt
do you believe as a citizen do you
believe that the war in Ukraine and our
support for it would look exactly the
same if if Hunter Biden had never done
his work in Ukraine does anybody think
it would look just the same
I don't think we do yeah all new now you
know this is a clearly a bubble audience
you're you're all in a pretty much all
of you were in the same bubble
so keep in mind that you're in a bubble
don't lose sight of the fact that there
may be another bubble with all different
information here
but here's the proper way to look at the
Hunter
Biden you know Joe Biden connection and
what's happening in Ukraine here's the
problem
you don't know
if that war was influenced by their
financial dealings
and you can't know
you can't know in other words there's no
way to know
because you'd have to read minds and
speculate to form a causal connection
and we can't read minds and the
speculation would be unfair
you know because Hunter Biden's innocent
until proven guilty right innocent until
proven guilty and by the way
I'm not sure he committed any crimes
after listening to Devin Archer I came
away thinking you know what it sounds
like a crime
but I don't know exactly what laws were
violated and you say well it's Farah you
know the foreign agent registration act
he should have been registered and then
I say are you sure
are you a lawyer in that field
are you sure that the way they did it
didn't make it okay because they knew
this law
these were lawyers very experienced in
you know this area they weren't
beginners
they probably set it up in such a way
that it's technically legal or legal-ish
or close to Legal something
so I'm not even sure there's a crime
there
but here's what I am sure of
I can't know and I don't know
if any of Hunter's actions affected our
support for the Ukraine war
or even if we would have a war I don't
even know if the war would exist
except for that connection but I also
don't have a direct causal link like I
can't tell you well this phone called
that conversation I don't see it
but you cannot have you cannot have a
president where you're not sure which
side he's on and you're legitimately not
sure and when I say west side I mean
maybe his own Financial dealings
ah
that is 100 unacceptable now I'm willing
to I'm willing to accept that when
people go into public office
they do well then they retire
that there are a variety of ways they
can monetize that
and I I think well that's not ideal
but probably it's okay you know most of
the time it's probably not the worst
thing but if you're a sitting president
and you and the public really can't tell
if you're if you're doing a dealing for
yourself or for the country that's
unacceptable it has nothing to do with
Democrat or Republican
believe me if Don Jr had been making
deals with Ukraine and then Donald Trump
took us to war or caused the War to
happen do you think I'd be oh that's
that's just their own business oh Donald
Trump he's not involved in his son's
dealings do you think I'd be saying that
God I hope not
like I hope not
I really really hope this would look
exactly the same to me if it were
reversed and it's not reversed
so to be the Vivek once again found the
most important question for the 2012
2024 election
you think oh I think the basic question
is you know his you know Biden's
competence or
you know I don't know inflation or
something but there's nothing more
important than this
it's a war
it's like a whole freaking War
if we're not even sure that our
commander-in-chief is on the same side
as the public
as opposed to doing some self-dealing
you can't live with that situation that
has nothing to do with politics that's
literally a military a military
situation
so the military decision is you've got
to have leaders that you can trust on
your side that's just minimum minimum
requirement is you have to know they're
on your side
we don't even know that
all right
um
there's a there's some reporting from I
heard Kelly mcenany and this will be
another test of your media savvy
here's yet another test this will be a
hard one
but I have given you the rules to do
this correctly right so there's a
there's a rule you can follow that'll
get you the right answer
um Kaylee mcinay says that uh Biden
privately told AIDs that Trump should be
prosecuted for January 6 and that he
wanted Merrick Garland to take decisive
Action Now people would be bothered by
this because it would show that Biden
they would interpret this as a political
act you know go get my opponent
um you Defenders might interpret it as
well he just wants the law to be
followed because you know this this
dangerous Insurgent must be stopped so
but let me ask you this
uh and apparently this is buried in a
New York Times story that this
conversation happened
um
who is the source
who was the source for this story it was
the New York Times but
who is the person
what's the name of the source
did they oh they didn't name a source
what do you know about Anonymous sources
tell you something that happened behind
closed doors
they're never true
you could just discount it as like act
like you didn't even hear it
pretend it never even happened like
there was no news story about it at all
right now it's important that I do it on
this story
because most of my audience is you know
leaning right
and this is just an example that happens
both ways
now I'm not saying that's not true
I'm saying that you should give it zero
credibility
in other words you can't tell anything
about it based on an anonymous source in
a political context it means nothing
nothing
so I hope you all got that one right how
many of you immediately noticed
that the source was anonymous
before I told you
did you see it right away because that's
what you should look for right away
anonymous source yeah a bunch of you got
it right away
all right there's a story about uh an
anti-racism instructor who
we're so mean to a white guy I guess at
a school Toronto principal that the
white guy killed himself
after being mocked by the Dei
instructor
as being a white supremacist and a good
example of what white supremacy looks
like
what do you think of that story
does that sound like a real story
or does it sound
two on the nose
a little too on the nose
yeah
that the Dei instructor
caused a white guy to kill himself
now I don't know that I don't know the
real story but wouldn't you have to be a
mind reader to know that that was the
cause of the suicide
I mean obviously it didn't make him
happy it didn't help him any and I could
easily believe it did I could easily
believe it's connected but we don't know
that
by the time somebody kills himself
I mean that's a pretty radical Act
so don't you think that
don't you think there might have been
more going on in his life than that
yeah you can imagine it's the last straw
but can you imagine that there would
have been no other last straw
if he was that close and I get that
that's a big deal you know being painted
as a white supremacist by your Dei
instructor that's
of a bad day at work
but
the the exact same thing happened to me
I I literally got branded a racist by
the entire United States
not once did I consider suicide
because you know other things were fine
right not once
I literally will go through the rest of
my life
knowing that in any public setting at
least you know 20 to 30 percent of the
public will believe that I'm a racist
it doesn't even a little bit suicidal
and to me it's just stupid and it's kind
of funny
like I literally when I'm alone I laugh
at it sometimes I think it's hilarious
that I'm a disgraced cartoonist and
honestly it's the way I wanted to go out
I wanted to go out as a disgrace
cartoonist I just didn't think it would
happen that way or that quickly
oh no I think this story is a little
suspect
you could definitely see the connection
between the Dei instructor and the death
but you'd have to accept a lot
this not in evidence that that was the
last straw and sometimes there's just
coincidences
but it didn't help certainly didn't help
any
all right
um
Rob Henderson and the Rob Henderson
newsletter and by the way Rob Henderson
is a good follow also for a lot of the
psychological
the studies and stuff
um Rob Henderson so just look for him
uh on Twitter which is now called X
and he said there's a in one of his
newsletter pieces he said there's a
declining uh rate of female happiness
so women used to report having a greater
well-being feeling well-being than men
but that's reversed and now men are
happier than women
at least in reporting their well-being
what do you think of that number one do
you believe that you could pull such a
thing
do you think that that could be measured
no
no
it can't be measured that's stupid how
would you even measure that you could
measure what people say
right you the only thing you're
measuring is what they say you're not
measuring their inner thoughts because I
don't think people you know are so in
touch with themselves that they even
know what's making them happy why
we're not really that smart that we're
like all right I'm uh I was a 7.6 Senate
yesterday but it looks like my numbers
are up to 8.2 all right that's not a
thing
all right so don't imagine that you
could poll people about their happiness
and get some kind of useful number
they've changed historically
so whatever the Baseline was and
whatever what for whatever reason
maybe there's some change to the
Baseline that might mean something but
why if you were to speculate why women
would seem recently less happy what
would be your first
guess for why
what's what's top of Mind as a
hypothesis
I'm gonna I'm gonna put my
hypothesis out there
I believe that when women decided to
compete with men as men
it was a strategic mistake
now clearly we're all you know awake and
aware enough that we want every human to
have all the opportunities of any human
so nobody has nothing to do with
opportunities everybody should do
whatever they want
as has often been pointed out by women
especially the the the competitive uh
workplace was designed by men
for men to compete the way men compete
if if our free market had been designed
entirely by women
it probably would look a little
different
so so you have basically women entering
a game they didn't design and was
designed for a different
set of personalities perhaps
so uh yes and let me say the other way
if men if men tried to enter you know
domains that women have been killing for
centuries
uh probably wouldn't do so well
so some of it may have to do with what
you're measuring
and what game you're playing
and if it's true that as women say that
that capitalism is set up by man to
favor male traits you know that there
are certain male aggressive risk-taking
traits
um
let me give you an example
when I take a risk
I often feel uh
excited by it
other people when they take a risk
feel anxiety
now that's not because I'm awesome
I was just born that way
I just like Risk not every risk I don't
like physical risk at all but lots of
risk you know risk of embarrassment that
sort of thing
risk of having to
blow my nose on live stream that stuff I
like
so here's the question do men and women
enjoy the same level of risk
well I would think that Evolution would
cause us to have a different appetite
for risk simply because uh women are
more valuable to reproduction
than men you know you only need a few
men and you get all the all the sperm
you want
um so logically men would be less
risk-averse because we don't need men as
much you know and yeah they have they
have their own roles in which taking
risk is actually a you know a positive
thing you know it's kind of risky to
hunt that big game and it's kind of
risky to go to war but you got to
protect the tribe
so
some of it has to do with just a
that but there could be lots of other
reasons that people are answering
differently could be fewer family
situations less happy marriages less
certainty about roles
you know the the one thing we don't like
to admit about humans
is that we're very comfortable being
told what to do
because you don't have to think and then
it's also not your fault if it goes
wrong
so you know men and women all of us we
kind of like to be told what to do and
in the old days it was obvious what you
were going to do if you were a woman
right you gotta get married and have
kids and take care of the home and even
if those were not you know individually
awesome and they were too limiting
options you know all the reasons that
had changed were good reasons but it
certainly gave you certainty
it told you what your role was and it
put you in it and that had to be good
for your mental health
same with men but now I suppose you say
to women all right you could be you know
mother and focus on that
but you could also be a career person
and you know put the family thing to the
back imagine the decision making you
would have to go through
to decide whether to be a mother or an
executive or to try to make both of them
work at the same time
that would be a really
um
disturbing choice and I'm glad I don't
have to make it right so I grew up
knowing exactly what I had to do
I probably knew exactly what I had to do
as a as a male
by
age of five
maybe by the time I was five years old I
knew exactly what I needed to do and it
never changed what I needed to do was
become as useful as I could
useful in the market useful to other
people useful financially
and not become a burden on other people
so you know job one
is not to make other people take care of
you
job one I knew that I knew I had to work
I knew I had to you know do something
useful not just move rocks
every every part of my life was just
presented to me even going to college
was presented to me basically at Birth
you know by my mother
you know I said I came out of the womb
and I think my mother was saying uh
College
you're definitely I don't know what else
you're definitely going to college
college and
I I didn't even know there was another
option you know by the time there was
time to apply to colleges
I'd never even considered another option
so I didn't have any uh unsettling
decisions and now at this point in my
life I could look at all the things I've
done and I can say oh yeah that was
pretty much on track I was supposed to
work hard I was supposed to make money
develop skills be useful yeah I did
those things I'm a man
but I can't imagine having had to choose
between that and some kind of you know
family
matriarchery kind of situation
that would have been a really really
disturbing choice because I think either
way I chose
it would have seemed like a mistake some
of the times
like some of the times I would wish I'd
go in a different direction
now I saw
um I want to give you a reframe that
might help you
this one also isn't my upcoming book
I'll tell you more about in the next
week or so
um
well I might have saved that one
actually
so
yeah let me see if that
all right that's all I have for you
today YouTube I hope my theme that
everything will be fine came through
yeah we get problems but we'll be fine
it's no worse than it's ever been in
fact it's probably better than it's ever
been a lot of on a lot of different uh
scales
um
let me finish the point I was going to
make if you're worried that your goal is
to spread your genes
I've I've heard people say that if you
don't get married and have kids
you failed in life because your your
primary goal is to spread your genes how
many of you think that way
that that would be a good definition of
success
that the thing that is you you know
lives on in your children
well I saw that on I saw somebody say
that on social media today and here's
the reframe for that
by the fourth generation
all of your contribution will be
randomized
right when you get together with one
mate and you have a kid
it's about a half you
when that kid gets married and has
another kid
it's maybe a quarter of you but you're
not even guaranteed that right because
it's not really half and half ever
you're not even guaranteed that you got
your half
by the time you're the fourth generation
you can barely tell who who contributed
anything right and you've brought in all
these outside people to be the people
you marry
you're only a few Generations from being
irrelevant
the fact that you might have contributed
some you know genetic raw material to
somebody five generations down
is so trivial and so unimportant
that they shouldn't be part of your
decision making
yeah your your tiny little contribution
to the gene pool will get washed and
deluded to nothing after a few
Generations anyway
so it really doesn't matter I do think
that we're designed or we evolved or we
are created to want to reproduce
so if you're if you're connected in any
way to the reproductive process of
society I think you do find meaning
so you could be just working law
enforcement
I think that's connected to reproduction
because if crime ran rampant
be less reproduction probably
so there are lots of ways to be part of
that reproductive chain but weirdly and
I know this seems upside down the least
important new thing you could do is
contribute your DNA
your DNA is the least important part of
the whole process because there's plenty
of DNA we're not going to run out you
know we don't need yours we might need
you to be a police officer
might lead you to you know work your job
and make some money so everybody can eat
eating is good but your genetic
contribution
that you're that's magical thinking yeah
yeah you got some particles some parts
of a gene will look like maybe they came
from you in four generations but it's
irrelevant
ladies and gentlemen
is everything I wanted to tell you and
YouTube thanks for joining
and I'll see you tomorrow
