good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization
it's the greatest thing since the big ba
oops
we're going to talk about that
but before we do that
would you like to take it up a level
would you like to take your energy up to
places that nobody's ever been before
yeah you do and all you need is a copper
mug or a glass of tanker chelsea stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
and if you're new to the locals platform
be sure you don't over sip no overdosing
but for the rest of you
please join me
in the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens
now
go
ah yeah
yeah that's the stuff
that is this stuff
all my systems are coming online
does it feel as good to you as it does
to me
do you feel a tingle yet oh you will
because the show is just getting started
that tingle will hit you any minute now
so uh
turns out the big bang has been debunked
i talked about this in my live stream
last night from my man cave
which only this locals people watched
but uh turns out that the hubble
telescope
can look so far into the universe we can
find out that everything we know is
wrong
everything we know is wrong
oh it's the web not the hubble it's the
web sorry
wrong telescope
james webb okay okay james webb we're
now corrected
um
but turns out everything we thought we
knew about the universe was wrong
and here's the dumb guy's explanation
of the smart people's realization
if you look to the farthest parts of the
galaxy the one thing you should
definitely expect to see
is that they look younger
that the furthest
galaxies would look the youngest
because they were the original ones that
have been expanding the furthest
but they're not younger
or they're not as young as they need to
be
in other words when you look at the
universe
the big bang theory just
collapses
it collapses
so
whatever is true about the universe
the big bang probably isn't true
and all the people who've been working
in that field forever are being kind of
quiet about it
but apparently according to at least one
report in hot air
but reportedly they're all pretty
nervous about the fact that the most
basic thing that we thought we knew
about reality that's not true
not even true
so
what would be a way to explain how
everything got here
without the big bang
huh
well looks like we're back to
intelligent design maybe maybe a little
god hypothesis back in the mix
maybe
maybe
but uh whether it's god or some
uh
some species that created another
simulation and it's us
we don't know or it could be just that
there's another scientific explanation
that we just don't know yet but if you
had guessed that both evolution and the
big bang would be
debunked in your lifetime
well you would have been right
i think
all right uh and i say
both of those are debunked because the
evil uh the simulation theory
is far more likely an explanation of how
we're here and it doesn't require either
evolution
neither evolution nor the big bang are
not required if we're a simulation
because software can just make things
any way it wants
um so the big news is that the daughter
of one of putin's closer
allies just got murdered in a car bomb
in russia
now
reportedly and this is not reliable yet
reportedly the father was supposed to be
in the car also but at the last minute
they may have taken different cars but
the car that was supposed to have
putin's close advisor in it
uh blew up
but the close adviser's
daughter wasn't
yeah so alexander dugan
was his name
now there's some disagreement about how
close he was or how influential he was
to
to
putin
but it feels to me like
maybe ukraine just sent him a message
what do you think
did ukraine just send a message
if you were ukraine wouldn't you try to
take out the leadership
in
moscow if you could
because russia tried to
try to decapitation strike on ukraine
if you're trying to take out the leader
of one country doesn't that country have
the right to try to take out your leader
i mean
forget about whether it's a right
because war is not about what's right uh
certainly it's a free punch
it's a free punch
now
now of course you're all going to say
some kind of weird false flag in china
or the united states or you know great
britain did it there's no evidence of
any of that
there's there's one candidate who looks
really likely
i don't think it's a cia
i mean i suppose if the cia killed a top
russian
and then got caught
that could never be worth the risk
there's no way the cia would would think
it's worth the risk
to take out
a civilian who's just an advisor
let me say that that sounds personal
it sounds personal
because apparently this guy was also a
super pro nationalist
so that's exactly who the ukrainians
would want to take
everything about this feels personal it
doesn't feel
if the cia did it it would be
professional
and it would have like a clear strategic
benefit this doesn't look exactly like a
strategic benefit it looks personal
i think they're just going to kill as
many people close to putin as they can
i would
you know if i if i were zelinski i would
try to
and i knew that putin was trying to kill
me and people i loved i would kill as
many people
around him as i could get to so i assume
it's him
but
you got to be careful about your
assumptions
speaking of assumptions
mitch mcconnell warns us
and i think he's right about this
that don't get too cocky about some big
red wave coming for the midterms
the house might and might in fact
turn republican
but
you should be warned that senate races
are different
and even if one party is more popular
than the other
senate races
tend to turn on the quality of the
candidate
so the senate is way more about the
individual differences between the
candidates
the house races are a little bit more do
you like to be a republican or do you
like to be a democrat today so
so don't get comfortable that
there's going to be a red wave that
takes both houses
the senate is probably a toss-up
the senate is probably a toss-up
now of course mitch would want to say
that mitch mcconnell
to make sure that republicans go and
vote
so
this is the phase where both sides are
going to tell you well it's really close
you better vote
we don't know which way it goes if you
stay home it could be up to you
so there's a little that going on too
but i do buy that theory that the senate
is more about the the
candidate than the house is does that
sound right to you
sounds right to me
all right there's a there's a new thing
happening that i'm seeing so much and i
absolutely hate it
and i call it the cringe victory lap the
cringe victory lap
it's people who had a position during
the pandemic
who believed that the science has now
proven that they were right
but it didn't
and so people are doing victory laps on
stuff that really isn't proven
it might be a little evidence you know
that looks like it's in your favor but
a lot of stuff isn't proven
and one of those things is happening is
you know i talked about the vitamin d
study that's highly correlated with
covet outcomes highly highly correlated
study after study
and therefore you should have taken
vitamin d
and you didn't need those vaccinations
say a number of people on
social media
but this study doesn't say anything like
that
not even close
the study says there's a correlation
that's
it um
somebody told me just before i got on
here and so it's just something i saw on
twitter
maybe if there's a doctor here you can
confirm or debunk this
i think there are enough doctors
watching this that we can get an answer
pretty soon somebody said that vitamin d
low vitamin d levels are highly
correlated with
heart disease
true or false
low vitamin d highly correlated with
heart disease
true
true or false
let's say um say if you're a doctor say
you're a doctor before you before you
give me the answer
yeah i think the answer is yes
but if you see something different there
tell me all right
so low vitamin d
highly correlated with heart problems
so therefore you should give everybody
who has heart problems vitamin d
supplements right doesn't that make
sense
highly highly correlated
but they don't do that
they don't do that do you know why
because they have not proven that
vitamin d supplements help your heart
disease
they just know it's correlated
so be careful the covet thing could be
that
now every time you find you know another
study that's in the same direction well
maybe it's telling you more but it seems
to me that if you did a hundred
randomized controlled trials and every
one of them confirmed that vitamin d is
highly correlated with good outcomes
is still
still would tell you nothing about
whether you should take more vitamin d
it feels like it does
but it doesn't matter how many of those
tests you do
it's just telling you the correlation
exists
but the correlation should exist
somebody said to me but scott's god's
got if you have a hypothesis
that's how you know that the study is
valid because the hypothesis is
better vitamin d gives better outcomes
but there are two hypotheses
one hypothesis is that people in poor
health have bad outcomes and people in
bad health have low vitamin d
so i don't want to beat this to death
but if you're doing a cringe victory lap
based on some science that does not
support your point of view
it doesn't conflict with it just doesn't
support it
now
somebody pointed out that i'm a
hypocrite
because i have a tweet from long ago
saying that vitamin d tests could be
used
to end the pandemic
and somebody said scott
why do you say vitamin d is
only correlated and yet at the same time
you're saying a vitamin d test would be
useful to end the pandemic how do you
explain that total inconsistency scott
does anybody know how i explain that
how do i explain the total inconsistency
that i believe a vitamin d test would be
very useful to have ended the pandemic
sooner
but i also don't think that the
causation is demonstrated
it's not inconsistent at all
i'm saying that correlation is
demonstrated and causation might be true
but it hasn't been demonstrated
correlation is all you need for the test
you don't need causation
to test to see if somebody's vulnerable
if there's a correlation that's all you
need oh these people are vulnerable
there's no there's no inconsistency
between those opinions
all right now just to make everything
complicated
so now i've done my impassioned
overly repeated statement that
correlation is not causation
and then cnn has a report that says
obesity might not make you unhealthy
do you know what their argument is
that obesity
might not be an indicator of bad health
do you know why
because it's a correlation
and that the causation has not been
proven
does that sound right to you
do you do you think that obesity is just
a correlation
it's not a causation
are we really at a point where that has
not been demonstrated
well let's switch over to fox news
let's see what fox news says
let's see fox news has a story about oh
okay story about a
sports illustrated swimsuit model who is
a plus-sized
uh plus-sized woman
and she wants you to know that she can
be healthy too
so both
both the left and the right media are
telling stories that are
telling us not to be so harsh
with those who have extra weight
because you're just assuming that
they're unhealthy and that's unfair
now it's really tough for me to go
from my impassioned argument that
correlation does not eq causation
and then have this story slap me in the
face
because even i think correlation equals
causation when it comes to weight
[Laughter]
do we really not know that
now now let me accept
i do accept the notion
that there are people carrying extra
weight
who are not especially unhealthy
do we all we all agree on that right
there are people who have some extra
pounds
or probably healthier than the average
person
that's got to be true because there are
so many people in the world we have all
types
so
you know any kind of person you
hypothesize exists it probably does
probably exists
but i'm pretty sure that extra weight is
not doing you any favors
i mean i can't believe that it's good
for you
or that it's even neutral
but okay
um
yeah
so uh i asked this question and got shot
down today
uh because i was watching the news
let's say the social media news what is
what is trending
and it seemed to me that everything
trending lately is about a man behaving
badly
a man behaving badly and i asked the
question are there
any women being
canceled or is it all men
and then of course i immediately learned
that yes there were many women who got
canceled so there was roseanne
gina carrano laura loomer j.k rowling
naomi wolf list goes on
but at the moment
yeah amber heard somebody says i guess
she got cancelled
uh liz jd maybe she got cancelled right
she-hulk got cancelled
paula dean yeah okay
however at the moment there's something
else going on
so at the moment these are the names
that
keep showing up in trending twitter
and they're showing up in terms of being
criticized
so
you've got your jordan peterson your joe
rogan alex jones elon musk andrew taint
uh sam harris brett weinstein
and
you know at various times you know brett
is not in the news at the moment but at
various times they've all been taken on
and here's the one i'm i'm wondering
about
does it feel like
um they're going after the internet dads
it's not it's not it's not not t-a-i-n-t
it's it's andrew tate t-a-t
taint
if you're hearing a difference that's
one of those
um
that's one of those uh laurel yani
things you hear what you want to say
because what i'm saying is t a t e
taint
how does it sound to you
see if you if you think it's the other
one you hear it that way
taint
um
so here's my question do you think
there's something about
masculinity that's
maybe people are afraid of
oh my god a lot of you here as with an n
you're hearing it that way that's funny
interesting
all right
i guess
i guess that wasn't interesting
um
is anything else happening you know
august is such a slow month
[Laughter]
so jordan peterson is getting a lot of
heat lately
what do you think about that
has jordan peterson said anything that
hurts anybody
because he's getting so much heat now a
lot of it is because he's you know he's
um
he's gotten emotional during interviews
and i do wonder what's up with that to
me that looks like um
health related
possibly some meds or
something's going on makes them a little
more emotional
but i hate judging them for that
are we gonna are we gonna judge
jordan peterson for being emotional
is that does that feel fair
like who who else are you gonna judge
for being emotional
what about me
yeah i i've shown you some uh different
looks here because you know this is live
so you get what you get whatever you get
i don't know it feels like a little bit
unfair doesn't it
to
to accuse him of being emotional
when in fact everything he does is based
on emotion
now when i say everything he does is
based on emotion i don't mean that he's
irrational he's very rational
he's highly pragmatic and rational
but you can see that he's driven by some
kind of emotional
impulses just like everybody else
just like everybody else
[Music]
so is see here's what it feels like
here's what it feels like to me
it feels like
the people on the left or the people who
maybe the the grand manipulators whoever
they are have decided that there are
certain internet personalities who have
too much
influence
so what it looks to me is that the the
people coming after everybody from
uh
joe rogan to andrew taint
um t-a-t taint
uh they're all trying to reduce their
influence
you know there are plenty of legitimate
reasons
to go after alex jones
right he gives you legitimate reasons
but i don't think that's the reason
you know obviously the sandy hook people
have a good reason but for the the
people who are piling on i don't think
it's so much about sandy hook you know
obviously some of it is but i feel like
it's reducing influence
because if you're a democrat the last
thing you want is for joe rogan to have
influence
right
and you want to you want to make sure he
has less influence before the actual
voting starts for 2022 and 2024.
so i feel like a lot of this is to take
to take players off the board
for election reasons going forward
that's what it feels like it feels like
players being taken off the board
and
you know they're coming from me right
are you all waiting for that
because i feel like you know a number of
people have
taken a run at it but nothing organized
or professional yet
so so far it's like individuals and
smaller publications and stuff but you
won't know that they came after me until
you see something in the wall street
journal
probably more likely there than the
washington post
do you know why the washington post is
less likely to write a hit piece on me
guess
why is the washington post the least
likely to write a hit piece on me
because they run dilbert
they run dilbert
it's one of their biggest comics
now it doesn't stop me from criticizing
them
and do you know why i don't get kicked
out of the washington post even though i
criticize them
guess why
why does dilbert not get kicked out of
the washington post even though i
viciously criticize them
well you're going to be surprised at my
answer
it's because uh newspaper editors have
balls
both the men and women were speaking you
know we're speaking uh
hypothetical or
metaphorical balls here
yeah newspapers newspapers are the last
bastion of free speech
you know even though they have their
issues
newspapers will run unpopular stuff
so a newspaper will let you be
be content at the same time you are
criticizing them free speech yeah
believe it or not it's a good reason
there is something
about the newspapers that will allow you
a little bit more um
little bit more
leeway
so and i appreciate that and i i think
that's worth calling out
but the new york times does not run
dilbert
right bloomberg does not run dilbert so
bloomberg tried to take me out during
the 2016 election run they did a big hit
piece on me
and
i'm expecting another one because that
one's kind of aged
and it can't be a small publication
because i wouldn't make enough
difference so it's got to be something
national
and something that dilbert is not
a client of
or vice versa
yeah a business insider would be sort of
the little
attack dog of
bezos
newspapers are less sensitive to cliques
well they're most of the newspapers are
online as well
cnn
i don't think cnn will do it
because it doesn't
i don't know if cnn would have enough
kick the atlantic maybe the atlantic
yeah
possibly the atlantic
but
the odds that there's nobody assigned to
write a head piece on me right now are
very low
what do you think what are the what are
the odds
that no one anywhere at a major
publication has been assigned
or has volunteered
to do a hit piece on me
it's pretty low
yeah somebody's coming for me and the
reason would be that
if they think i have any influence over
anything
uh
you're not worthy
maybe not
maybe not
that's right i'm the rogue cartoonist
so my comics about esg
are in the pipeline so you're not going
to see those until
later in september
but remember i have until the end of the
year i promised you to get rid of esg
do i have a dead man switch
i mean where i is that where i release
all the good secrets
now that would be a good idea
wouldn't that be a good idea
do you have any idea how much stuff i
know
that
would be a bad idea if it ever got
became public
it's quite a bit
but
nothing that i need to get out
especially
um
better release at the locals first yeah
yeah mcafee said he had a dead man
switch but nothing happened or did it
maybe mcafee's dead man switch is not
one that you're supposed to know is
happening
maybe just something is happening you
never know
yeah most dead man switches don't work
hoover blackmail jfk
allegedly
what's the most harmful thing you know
there's a good question what's the most
harmful thing i know that you don't know
i don't know that any of it's hurtful
probably probably none of it makes it if
it were harmful i probably would have
told you by now
a lot of it is just how you understand
the world
there are a lot of things that you just
think are one way that really really
isn't
how many people do you think know
the truth of epstein's death
how many how many people alive do you
think know the truth
now that one i don't know but i can tell
you i i've heard theories that you
haven't heard
but i don't know i have no way to know
what's credible in that but i've
definitely heard things you haven't
heard
so that's all i know
but i wouldn't repeat them because i
have no way to
validate them
yeah there's got to be i think there are
at least 100 people who know exactly
what happened with epstein
because if only two or three or you know
whatever new
in at some point that two or three are
definitely talking
you can't wait to die because you have
such a good dead man's switch
the theory on why no prosecutions it's
obvious
it's obvious there are important people
who would be prosecuted
i would say that's obvious
it's exactly what it looks like
sometimes things are exactly what they
look like
and it looks like
powerful people are being protected it's
probably exactly that
yeah and what difference does this make
i don't know
all right
um
nato shape
what's that mean
milo yiannopoulos has been going a long
time yes he has
but with a hundred could there be a
whistleblower
well
you know i i think it's going to come
out eventually don't you
why did epstein not have a uh
have a kill switch
a dead man switch i think epstein's dead
man switch worked
didn't it
because the uh
the fact that
those names didn't come out tells me
that something happened behind the
scenes
yeah well i don't know
do we know the jimmy hoffa thing yet or
no
yeah
galen got
convicted of transporting children to no
one effectively
obama had affairs somebody's asking i
don't know about any of that
but but i do think some uh
obama surprises are in the future
this is where you come for the best and
the worst takes all right let me ask you
this
what's the worst take you've ever seen
me take
the worst take i've ever had go ahead
and i think it'll be different on
what's my worst take
vaccinations now you do know that on
vaccinations i have not been proven
wrong right
so my worst to take i've not been proven
wrong
right because my take is that the
vaccinations would not
prevent
i was right
that therapeutics would be important
i was right
and that if i personally got the
vaccination
i could travel
but chances are i wouldn't have an
adverse effect
and i traveled and i did not have an
adverse effect
i would say that everything i did was
right for me
in the sense that i did not encounter a
problem yet
now if you're going to say buzz scott
what about that risk of the vaccination
we'll kill you later well then you'd be
right
then you would be right
wait and see
the slaughter meter
well the slaughter meter uh
if you're talking about
2020
you've made a big assumption
that the election went the way
um
went the way a normal election should go
i don't think anything like that
happened i think that what happened was
that at the very least the rules were
gamed in a legal way
so that any prediction
could not have really taken that into
account
the same harris defense
no that's not my worst take
all right
the simulation well it's a trillion to
one i'm right about that
um
zelinski wins with the drones i think i
was right on ukraine
do you think i was wrong on ukraine i
feel like i had the most right
prediction on ukraine of anybody in
public
because i said that or russia could not
conquer ukraine
and that if ukraine had enough weapons
they could even push russia back
to some other
and at the moment russia is deadlocked
weapons depots are being destroyed
i don't know
i i would say that even being slightly
wrong
i had the rightist prediction that
ukraine would do a better job of
defending than the experts said
i would say that's one of my best takes
release the kraken the release the
kraken thing was
clearly wrong
and let me let me say i was going to
talk about that actually because i think
in my wrongness there's something to
learn there
do you remember
there was a time when sidney powell got
involved in the election stuff and she
was coming off her good reputation with
um general flynn
and people were talking about her at
least people on the right we're talking
about sidney powell as sort of a
god-like
legal figure
a very high level operating legal person
now i believe that
because there were i didn't hear anybody
say the opposite
there was nobody saying well you know
she's not really a real lawyer
she got her she got her law degree in
the mail
nothing like that
so if you take the assumption that this
is a real high-level lawyer
and that real high-level lawyer says i
have the goods and i'm going to show to
you is really really important
you do expect that they have the goods
but here's where i was completely wrong
sidney powell's reputation seems to be
not um exactly
matching
her actual reality
and i got that completely wrong
now that was surprising
that was surprising because when i heard
the um
the venezuelan hacking stuff
i knew that was fake the minute i heard
it
do you remember that
so
to my slight credit
and let's see if you can handle this
nuance
i was a hundred percent wrong that the
kraken would be a real thing
but i was 100 right when i heard what
the kraken was that i called on
it
well as soon as i heard the venezuelan
general
stuff i said oh no no i'm out i'm out
that's not true
that's not true
now
i'm guessing
the sidney powell got conned as somebody
just said i think that somebody who was
good at
conning
got to her
but still
but still i don't think i would have
believed if i'd been in that situation
i might have i might have played it
differently and said something like
well we've got some really interesting
leads
but we don't want to tell you about it
till we track them down
uh
so i did not know that she was not
operating at the high level and so i was
completely wrong
so i did trust that she would be able to
vet information
but that was easy to vet that one was
easy
you could just hear it and go no no
that's not true
[Laughter]
so yes
so that if i were to if i were to make
my own list
of things with that i was most wrong
about i would put the kraken at the top
of my list
similar to how i got conned by peter
thiel what would be an example of that
in what way did peter teal economy
i don't know what the topic is
what did peter thiel say that
that i bought into
um
you'd be hunted
well i think most people
accept that hunted has actually happened
well you remember you're adding the
literally
i said republicans would be hunted
and and republicans say that that's
happened
you added you added a new word literally
to make it look like they're wearing you
know hunting outfits and rifles
so you have to add a word to make me
wrong
you see that you see that if you had to
if you had to add a word to what i said
and it's the added word that makes me
wrong
that's not really my problem
if you thought hunted meant literally
uh
like that rascally wabbit you know elmer
fudd and he'd have like a shotgun if
that's what you thought the tweet meant
i'm not sure that's my responsibility is
it if you took that literally
but it's been totally true yeah in a
metaphorical sense
all right well you don't have too many
uh so so far your criticisms of me are
either misinformed or the ones i agree
with so i think we're largely on the
same page except for the things you were
imagining
uh
you you suggested that the kraken was
reputable data analysis
yes
uh well i didn't say irrefutable but
again you're adding you had to add a
word didn't you
do you notice how people have to add
words to make me wrong
i never would have said it irrefutable
if i'd said that i would be wrong
but
the data analysis did show great
irregularities
in my opinion those irregularities do in
fact
make the case
but since i don't want to be banned from
social media i will say
unambiguously no court has found any
fraud that's big enough
the the parts that worry me are the
uh the places that were reliably voted
one way and then they they went a
different way
to me those are convincing signals
that something was
up that we don't understand
doesn't mean the election was
rigged
doesn't mean that and there's no no
proof of that
but those irregularities to me are
unexplained
even now
you literally said literally
i think i'd have to see that
give me my exact proof so i may be
talking about two different things
tell me my exact statement and then i'll
tell you if we're talking about the same
thing
because that doesn't it's not the way i
talk i wouldn't use literally in that
context the one you're talking about but
i may have used it in some other context
yeah covington kids being a-holes
yeah i was wrong about that for 24 hours
i don't know do you
do you think that if somebody's wrong
for 24 hours and they immediately
correct
is that a bad take
because we're all wrong in the first 48
hours
pretty much everybody's wrong on day one
because nobody knows anything
so
i would agree that's wrong but if you
were to rank the covington kids
wrongness
that'd be like a one and a ten
but definitely wrong
like i'm not saying it was right it was
completely wrong but in terms of its
importance
one out of ten
buh
if you listen and change with new
information which is good
all right
um
sam harris about the hunter laptop and
yeah sam harris gets 48 hours to clarify
everybody gets 48 hours
[Laughter]
oh you said kamala was one of the most
effective public speakers yeah i was
definitely wrong about kamala harris
being capable
i still don't know what went wrong
can anybody explain why she seemed
capable in senate hearings before she
ran for office but clearly is not
capable
how was it she
how did she win
so many elections that she became
senator
when
when we observed that she doesn't have
any qualities that would suggest she
could have made it that far
i know what you're going to say she
slept with people blah blah blah
but i don't think it's that i mean she
won the elections
uh
yeah
so the the weird thing about my kamala
harris
prediction is it was the most accurate
prediction that was totally wrong
it was totally wrong so she did not
become the presidential candidate
but she did become president for two
hours
it's the weirdest wrong prediction i
ever made i've never been more right on
a prediction that was completely wrong
uh she won in california but still
even in california she had to run
against
people who could talk
i just don't understand maybe something
happened to her
you know maybe
did she hit her head
oh you know what that would be an
interesting question
has kamala harris ever had
an accident where she banged her head
like in the last several years
that's a serious question by the way
because what we observe doesn't look
like
she could have always been this way
somebody says it's the vaccination
let's tie it all
together you know i think she doesn't
have enough vitamin d
i think the kraken got her
i think the kraken
hurt her brain
but quite seriously she doesn't look
like the same person
so
it looks like something happened
and if i found out she had banged her
head
uh
it's cause somebody looked that up
it's a serious question did she have any
kind of accident
where she had a head injury because it
looks like it it really does look like
she had a head injury
headboard
[Laughter]
all right
that is the inappropriate joke of the
day
the the inappropriate joke of the day is
that
goblin harris's head injury came from
the back the headboard of the bed
i do not approve of such jokes they are
sexist probably racist
so you should be ashamed of yourself
for making me laugh like that
now here's one thing i'm never gonna
i'm never gonna apologize for
i'd like to just put it out there i'm
never going to apologize for laughing at
an inappropriate joke
because it's the inappropriate part that
makes me laugh
if the joke were not inappropriate it
wouldn't even be anything
it's it's the fact that it's completely
socially unacceptable that makes it
funny in the first place i'm not gonna
apologize for laughing at something
that's socially unacceptable
that always makes me laugh
even if it were about me
like like even if i'm the target of the
joke
funny is funny
if it's inappropriate it's inappropriate
it makes me laugh
so i'm gonna laugh at anything i think
is funny and i'm gonna associate in any
way with anybody i want and none of
those are your business
i like to just re-emphasize that as
often as possible
all right
uh what's on the bottom shelf behind me
uh headphones
that i'm not using
kamala can dish out the criticism but
can she take it sure
heinlein says all humor is meant to hurt
someone
is that true that all humor is meant to
hurt someone
it's pretty close to the truth
uh
she came back looking different
yeah she did i assumed that was just
some cosmetic work
uh not dad jokes yeah dad jokes don't
have any target that's true
the guy walks into a bar and says ouch
okay
all right well i don't have anything
else to say so i won't keep you um
august is a slow news month
for all the obvious reasons as soon as
we get into the august doldrums
well then we'll have some fun
because the election is going to really
heat up
september going forward
all right
and that's all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
