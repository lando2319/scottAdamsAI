and welcome to a highlight of human
civilization that's called coffee with
Scott Adams there's never been a final
moment or a final place or a finer time
and we'll be doing the best live stream
you've ever seen in your entire life
pretty soon
and how would you like to take it to
another level a higher Dimension a range
in which a few people have ever
experienced this kind of Joy well all
you need to do that is a cover mug or a
glass of tanker Chelsea Steiner canteen
Jaguar flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine here today
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now
go
oh
I feel like I felt that in all of my
extremities
all of them
I mean all of them
well let's talk about the funny news
first
Andrew Tate has converted to Islam
now
I didn't think that was true
and I had actually researched it
it's actually true
no it's true he actually did
and uh
uh there's a video of him prior to
converting there's a video of him going
around
saying that Isis was the only true Islam
because they meant what they said they
would actually kill you
if you didn't take the religion
seriously so he's on record saying the
real life the Real Islam is Isis
now
to be fair I'm pretty sure of that
opinion came before the decision to
actually convert I feel I feel as if he
may have modified his opinion since then
but
my imagination
let me just ask you this is my
imagination that there are some
characters who when they burst on the
scene
you can say on day one that this is that
it's going to end up on the rocks
like yeah yeah that
do I
uh that was a good trick all right so
you can look at some people say I feel
like this is not going to end well
[Laughter]
now who knows you know who knows you
know maybe maybe you'll make it work who
knows
but uh since he's one of my mascots I
like to keep track of him
um
there's not really much to say about
that is there
because now that he's in he can't really
leave because I think you get yeah you
get a little pressure on you if you try
to leave Islam so he's in there
now at the same time he's also building
some kind of a
I don't know men's organization movement
some people call it a pyramid scheme I
don't know I haven't looked into it but
I have a feeling that that's going to
hurt recruitment
it might hurt recruitment
all right well I'm seeing in the popular
press
that conservative people have been
making jokes about Paul Pelosi and let
me tell you there's the popular press
says there's nothing funny
about the Paul Pelosi situation there's
nothing funny about that
so uh
do you agree with that
all right here is an edge case for the
Golden Rule
all right now I I try to live by the
Golden Rule
not entirely because sometimes you have
to modify it a little bit for people
being different
but
my Golden Rule says I wouldn't laugh at
somebody else
unless I would be comfortable if the
situation were reversed that they would
be laughing at me
and in the Paul Pelosi situation
of course it's a tragedy and first we
think of the human element right first
we're first we're happy that he's going
to fully recover as far as We Know
and it's it's horrible you have to go
through with that and by the way I don't
think there's any such thing as fully
recovered do you
if you're 82 and you get a fractured
skull from a home invasion you don't
fully recover
you don't that's not a thing he's
whatever the mental PTSD part of that is
you know good luck getting rid of that
so I'm not sure full recovery is even a
real thing except in some you know
strict medical sense
so we of course care about the person
however
having said that
if I were to put myself in this
situation
and let me commit to this I'm going to
commit to this publicly
should I ever be attacked by somebody
with a hammer
and both the attacker and I are wearing
underpants at the time of the attack
and there's no one else in my home
I give you full
permission and authority to have fun
with that
I would want you to enjoy that why
because I love you
I love you do you think I'm going to
give you a gift like that and tell you
not to open it
oh no if somebody gives you a gift like
that
a hammer attack in your underpants if
you get a gift like that you get to open
it I would never deny you that laugh so
let me say if anything like that ever
happens to me and
let's be honest
if you were going to guess a second
person who might die or be attacked in a
hammer by Hammer attack
and there's also in his underwear as
well as the attacker if you tried to
guess gosh that seems really unlikely
that that would happen twice but if it
did
who would you guess would be a likely
candidate for the second person that
would happen to
well probably me probably me
uh I don't know probably me
just thinking
and so I tell you in advance
if anything bad happens to me that is
also funny
you get my permission have fun with it
please have fun with it now I do think
it's going a little too far
you know with the allegations of the gay
sex and stuff which I don't think has
any as any backing whatsoever in my
opinion
but uh that's a different matter but
have fun with it I think that we should
be allowed to have fun with funny things
and I can't help it if it's funny if
it's funny it's funny it's not my I
don't make the rules
all right uh Tim Ryan
who is a politician running for
uh a governor
Senate
against
he's running against
JD Vance
for Ohio exactly
um have I revealed just how much I
follow State politics and other states I
feel I have I feel you don't know how
what percentage of the American public
could have answered that question
how many people could have told you the
two candidates running from running for
Senate in Ohio
you say 25 no way
but it's
three to five percent maybe three to
five percent but most of you if you're
watching this live stream you're
probably in the top five percent of
people who pay attention to politics
yeah anyway so what's interesting about
it is there was a Fox News Town Hall
and uh Tim Ryan was talking about
January 6 and uh said that a police
officer was killed on January 6 a
capitol police officer which every one
of us knows is not true would you agree
a hundred percent of the people in this
live stream
know that that didn't happen right 100
of you I'll bet there's not one person
who doesn't know that's a lie
but do you think Tim Ryan knew
what do you think do you think he knew
that that was a lie
I actually think he didn't
I actually I actually think he didn't
and the only reason I think that is
because it was an unnecessary thing to
say and and here's what happened he said
that in front of a live Fox News
audience
how do you think that went if you didn't
see it
how do you think it went when in front
of a live Fox News audience he claimed
that a capital police officer was killed
on January 6 the audience went nuts
they they basically just yeah they just
went nuts at him now he pretended like
he was just being heckled and you know
it was just generic heckling but that
wasn't generic echoing
that was the case correct me if I'm
wrong but do you think
that he knew yeah give me your answers
do you think he knew that he was lying
or that it was a lie do you think he
knew it was wrong
some of you say yes and I applaud your
skepticism
right and I don't know that you're wrong
but I'll tell you he looked like he
believed it
in my in my opinion which you know isn't
worth much in this particular case but
my read of the man is he wouldn't have
said it in that crowd
he wouldn't have said it there if he
knew it was untrue because it was a live
crowd that would have been an obvious
mistake and he could have ignored that
one detail his whole point his point
Didn't require it so I feel like he
actually thought it was true
now
how many times have you seen an entire
audience being better informed than the
politician that they came to see when
was the last time that ever happened
probably every time a Democrat is in
front of a Fox News audience
all the time right now you don't have
that situation a lot but about 100 of
the politicians who come before a Fox
News live audience know less about
what's happening in the country than the
audience and I mean that I mean that
literally and I mean that with
confidence
because when you see that even a major
politician doesn't know what the news is
it's because they follow a certain set
of news that doesn't tell them the news
how would they know the news if you
don't read the news you don't know the
news right it doesn't come to you
I mean most of the time
so there's something like some kind of a
sign of the times or like a like an
indicator or a you know Canary in the
coal mine there's something about the
fact that the entire audience knew more
than the Senate Senate candidate that
feels important doesn't it
is it just me like that feels like
like a sign of something
right this should be the point where
everybody realizes wait a minute are you
telling me that the the information
bubble is so bad
that you could run for Senate and not
know a basic fact about the most
important story for the last year I mean
January 6 was treated as the most
important story and one of the most
basic facts about it you didn't know
that's incredible all right let's let's
really telling us something
like however you think something's going
too far
it's one thing when the public is
confused
but when the politicians themselves
don't know what's true you've kind of
you've got a whole other problem that's
where we're at
that's where we're at
here here's just a an update a
persuasion update to something I've said
before so it's not a new thought but
whenever I think of a new persuasive way
to frame things I like to share it with
you just to teach you the persuasion
part of it all right now in my opinion
there are two types of racism the
old-timey racism where somebody would
say my people are better than your
people
I'll call that the old-timey Ku Klux
Klan kind of direct racism
and then there's a systemic racism where
it's sort of embedded in the system I
think the the teachers unions being the
top example of that all right you could
argue what is and what is not in there
but you probably would not argue that
whatever is or is not in the systemic
part is different from the part that was
just in people's minds and souls and
hearts
now
I think there's very little of the
old-timey racism left
meaning I don't know if I ever see it
like I live in Northern California so
maybe it's it's real different here
other people have said they live in the
south and they say oh yeah oh yeah
there's there's like the old kind is
there like they're definitely people
just saying all of my people are better
than all your people that's a real thing
I never I've never I don't think I've
seen it
almost ever as an adult
it's very rare and believe me people
would tell me right people would tell me
you know if you're alone in a room with
me you know you can say anything
people know they can say anything to me
alone in a room so I would know what
they were really thinking nobody nobody
would hold back but here's my new
framing
this is just about the old-timey racism
not about the systemic stuff
um it's stolen valor
Stolen Valor
if you think you're awesome because
you're white
you're kind of saying you're awesome
because Ben Franklin invented something
all right I'm simplifying just say there
other people did awesome stuff
I'm not Ben Franklin
I don't get any credit for Ben Franklin
inventing a light bulb or whatever no
I'm sorry not Ben Franklin but you know
I don't get I don't get credit for
anything any white person did
do I and if I took credit for that it
would be Stolen Valor you know the the
term we use for people who claim
military service but we're not actually
in the military
it's stolen valor and I think that
Stolen Valor is strong enough
that that what's left of that old-timey
racism
maybe that's enough to stamp it out
because if you said to you know if you
could actually get one of these
old-timey racism racists in a room and
you said you know that's kind of Stolen
Valor you're kind of taking credit for
other people's accomplishments there
like what have you done right do black
people get credit because Michael Jordan
is really good at basketball
or was no no because they're not him
right they can't do what he did so they
don't get credit
anyway
um
then I thought suppose you're going to
deal with the systemic racism
and let's say you wanted to do something
that was practical and doable and both
sides
could could uh agree on
here's how I do it
I'd say Democrats make a list a ranked
list of where you think systemic racism
is the worst
so we we know to focus on first and then
the Republicans would make their own
list
of systemic racism problems now the the
Republican list would have at the top
teachers unions the teachers unions
prevent competition in schools the lack
of competition in schools keeps black
students at the bottom because they're
already in bad schools overall you know
in general and nothing's changing that
right so that's what would be the top of
the Republican list what would be at the
top of the Democrat list
what would it be
what would be at the top of the Democrat
list no for a system that needs to be
changed because we're talking about
systemic racism now talking about people
don't talk about Trump we're not talking
about people no people
I think they'd put education at the top
am I wrong
so what would happen to
prisons interesting you know prisons
would be near the top too but guess what
if you put if you put prisons
and education at the top are things that
need to be fixed and even maybe police
you could get Republicans and Democrats
to largely agree
think about it
I suppose your lists were largely
different
listen let's say three out of five of
the things on your list of the top five
things you'd work on were different
but I'll bet the top two are the same
or or at least there's top two you could
work on so if the left and the right
wanted to work on things productively
which by the way I don't think that's
the case
but if they wanted to the way you would
do it is say make your top five list
compared to our top five list and say oh
wow even though the lists are different
three out of five
we both have the same two on there we
both have prisons and
uh you know let's say the justice system
and education work on those work on
those you've got something to agree on
so today's uh overall theme is that the
Golden Age may not be upon us
but it is accessible
meaning it's within reach we just gotta
see it just gotta see it and
grab it there's gonna be some more
stories in there
I've told you about the Adam's law of
slow-moving disasters which I developed
decades ago and so far keeps working
and the law goes like this if humans can
see a disaster coming
from far away
we always find a way to survive it and
make it no problem it's only the sudden
problems like the pandemic the pandemic
shows sudden problem now arguably Bill
Gates warned us years in advance that we
should have been ready for it but you
can't be ready for a specific virus it's
hard to be ready for some specific one
so those are the ones that are really
dangerous
but how are we doing on the ones we can
see coming for a while number one would
be climate change you might agree or
disagree the extent of the problem but
would you agree that nuclear energy is
now favored by almost everybody who
matters
and that largely that's going to be part
of the solution would you agree
I told you a story well you don't have
to agree with this I told you a story
that one of the biggest problems with
solar panels is the recycling of the old
ones
and there's a you know an entity which
is figured out how to recycle 98
which would be a huge solution likewise
on batteries
battery storage there are those huge
developments and some of them don't
require Rare Earth minerals
so their their battery designs that
don't require a rare or anything
now of course Elon Musk has noted that
those Rare Minerals exist basically
everywhere
so there's the least rare thing that
they are but we call them rare because
they're they're hard to mine
uh but they exist everywhere
so would you say that the Adam's law of
slew moving disasters is going to take
care of climate change
if you assume that that's the problem
that we've been told it is and I say yes
I say that everything we're doing from
developing CO2 scrubbers to developing
every kind of alternative power
it does look like we're in good shape
now will the temperature go up yes will
it I mean who knows why I mean you could
argue that some is natural some is not
but yeah it'll probably go up will it uh
will it wipe out Humanity probably not
probably will will survive better every
year than the year before now the
pandemic sent us back a little bit but
generally the lifespan of humans and our
ability to survive just gets better
every year no matter what else is going
on
all right so climate I think is okay
we're running out of fertilizer but now
there's some stories about at least one
big fertilizer maker is ramping up their
fertilizer production because the price
of gas has come down enough to make that
worthwhile
so I'm still worried about fertilizer
that that's the one that's so unsexy
we don't talk about it at all but it's
really really really really really a big
problem like it's as big a problem as
you could possibly imagine in the human
existence
but I also think we'll solve it
I I think the right people are working
it
I because it seems to me that if you
knew your yield was going to go down
correct me if I'm wrong are there not
plenty of fields that could be planted
that you wouldn't normally plant
that's true right even in America I
don't know about other countries but in
America don't we have fields that you we
don't plant that we could
right
so we could kind of ramp up and let's
say two or three years couldn't we ramp
up quite a bit
even if the
even if the yield went down per acre
I don't know
but I think we could
um how about the supply chain when was
the last time somebody complained about
the collapsing supply chain
is it fixed
I can't remember the last time I had a
problem because of the supply chain
it feels like you sort of
it's not fixed right I understand it's
not fixed but when was the last time it
made a difference
somebody says diesel is close to
collapse
diesel fuel is running low yeah
now that could be an example of
something that snuck up on us
because I haven't even heard of that to
them
baby formula cars are expensive but but
the system stretched didn't it
the the system didn't collapse
you know it just adjusted and you know A
Million Ways
um what about food shortages today we
learned that Russia is back on board
with shipping grain out of Ukraine which
should help a great deal
I think we're probably going to make it
through the year or two without Starving
in a mass way
and I also think that Europe's energy
shortages they'll find a way you know
apparently Germany already has enough
stockpile gas to get through the winter
so
it looks like
all of our long-term obvious problems
are heading more toward a solution than
not
now fentanyl
fentanyl is still an out of control
problem
but
what would it take for everything to
change with fentanyl
what would it take
well probably
now
um somebody told me that there's a
popular video game that just came out
that features American forces attacking
the cartels directly in Mexico can you
confirm that what's the name of the game
I'm sure somebody knows it it said
Destiny 2
um what's it called is it Call of Duty
or Modern Warfare
I don't know which one it is I don't I
don't do gaming
there are more people saying Modern
Warfare 2 than other things it looks
like no it's Destiny 2. all right well
there's a we have a disagreement
there's slightly more people saying
I don't know I'm getting five different
answers here anyway you can find it
pretty easily with the Google search but
my point is this
when a video game features America
attacking the cartels what do we know
what's that tell you
what's it tell you when there could be a
video game attacking Mexico
I'll tell you what it tells you
there's there's one thing it might be
telling you that I don't know do you
remember the bad old days it's now
confirmed
that the intelligence agencies of the
U.S and the government
was definitely influencing movies
to make them propaganda to make people
more patriotic and join the military and
all that so you would agree that in the
past movies and TV were used by the
government to use to do propaganda on
the public agreed that that's that's a
fact that nobody doubts there's there's
nobody who's questioning that that's
within the record okay now if the
government were trying to influence uh
modern
kids how would they do it
well they might try to do it on social
media
but the trouble is the social media
company is that's a little bit more of a
wild west and there's not much they can
do with Tick Tock and you know there's a
limit to what you can do but I'm sure
they would try social media yeah they
would use education for example but I
think they would use video games
I think they would have to influence the
video game industry
now I'm not claiming this happened
but is it a coincidence
that we're getting close to having a
decision a national decision about
attacking Mexico the cartels
we're getting close to having to make
that decision and then suddenly a
popular game pops up in which they treat
it as a matter of fact
by matter of fact I mean they normalized
attacking Mexico
is it a coincidence that a popular
American video game
just normalized attacking Mexico you
think that's a coincidence
it could be right it totally could be
yeah I'm just saying that if if American
history
is telling us what's happening now and
I'm not sure it is right I don't think
the history repeats the way historians
want to tell us it does I just don't
think it does but this is where you
would look if you expected some bad
behavior by your government to you know
do propaganda on its own citizens where
would you look first
video games that would that should be
the first place you look right am I
wrong because video games are so
absorbing I would imagine you know
everything I know about persuasion tells
me that there would be more influential
than other types of media
because you don't get immersed you know
tick tock's super influential
anyway
um
Benjamin Netanyahu is apparently heading
for likely victory in Israel so he would
take the top job again
does that feel like
foreshadowing
does anybody see The Return of Netanyahu
as feeling like
it's going to be 2016 all over again
if Netanyahu gets back in office is
there any chance Trump won't as well
I feel like
I feel like Israel's baby having the
same experience that America had
and it goes like this
we hate that leader that leader is so
obnoxious that leader is so provocative
ah we hate that leader we oh good we got
rid of that leader we sure hated that
leader and then you realize that the
stuff the leader did
was kind of stuff he liked
it's just you didn't like the leader you
know there was a personality problem or
something or or the news it framed them
in a way that was terrible but I feel
like
Trump and Netanyahu have that same thing
remember when Trump left office I told
you Trump would be more popular every
day he was gone
because once his personality like fades
in your mind then you just get to see
what he did and what he did was strong
very strong in my opinion
yeah
so I know it feels like a returned
returned to something
um
so Greta tunberg we Michael
schellenberger had a tweet thread
apparently Greta tunberg is uh not happy
with almost destroying the planet with
her climate change activism
but now she'd like to get rid of the
whole capitalist system
in her words quote the whole capitalist
system
which he says is responsible for the
quote imperialism oppression genocide
racist oppressive uh extractism
extractionism I guess that's mining
other countries would be the
extractionism I'm guessing
and what do you think is she correct
that the capitalist system is
responsible for imperialism oppression
genocide racism I say yes
I'd say yes
yeah
no no I love my uh capitalist system
so let me be clear I'm pro-capitalist
but if you say does it also create the
opportunity for these other things
imperialism repression genocide racism
yeah yeah
do you know what else creates the
situation for those things
everything else
right everything else
because you know why imperialism
oppression genocide racism and
oppressive extractionism those are
qualities of humans
that's not quality of a system you could
put any human in any system they still
want to do all this stuff and they still
be able to do it it would look different
but it's still all this stuff
so Greta
uh probably the most destructive person
since Hitler
would that be fair to say is Greta
tunberg the most destructive
Global personalities sin sailor I'm not
comparing her to Hitler because I have a
rule against that
because you know nothing's compared to
Taylor but I would say second
place
Paul Pott only had six million I think
Greta will have a bigger
um there's a good chance Greta's uh body
count will be bigger bigger than Stalin
um
yeah Stalin had a in Mao okay Stalin and
Mao had tens of millions do you think
Greta will get over tens of Millions
I think so
yeah I mean she could
you know we hope that we have time to
correct but the in terms of her um
impact it does have the POS it has the
potential to kill 100 million people
would you agree with that I'm not
predicting it well I think we'll adjust
because the atoms law of slow-moving
disasters Etc but she's a risky
personality she's a pretty risky
personality
all right here's a scary story
uh do you know the online betting app
predicted I used it when I bet on Trump
for 2016. and
um apparently the
the Commodities Futures Trading
commission is moving to shut it down
for political bets so the Quebec is
illegal they'd like to make it illegal
to or like they shut it down so you
can't make political bets now do you
know what reason they give they gave for
getting rid of this uh popular service
that people seem to enjoy
well obviously they gave a reason right
um so there's a good reason there's a
good reason so the reason you'd want to
shut down a
a big futures Market that's working
perfectly and bothering nobody and by
the way the predictive markets sometimes
a better job of predicting outcomes than
even polls right but anyway they they
get the Commodities Futures people gave
a good reason for wanting to shut them
down the reason was um
a reason
oh no reason no reason given no reason
given
no reason given
huh
I guess we're left to speculate what
would be a reason
for the government to want to get rid of
one of the only independent ways you
could check
that the polling and the election were
not rigged
why would they want to get rid of that
huh I know I can't think of a reason can
you
nothing comes to me
so here is exactly the kind of situation
where I say this
if you give me a reason
might like it and I like it but I would
say to myself well at least you know I
support the system
so the the system came up with a reason
the system is doing what it's doing if
we need to change it later we will but
you know
I don't have to get everything I want
right I I don't support systems that
only give me what I want
I support systems that kind of keep
Society together right because that's a
bigger goal
um
but here's the thing
when your system makes a change of this
magnitude and doesn't give a reason you
should assume that it's the wrong reason
Fair
you should assume that the Commodities
Futures Trading commission did not
simply forget to tell you the reason
I don't think they just forgot to tell
you
now these are criminals
so let me say it again as far as I can
tell now this would just be based on
their actions that we can see publicly
as far as I can tell the commodity
Futures Trading commission are
corrupt criminals
now
I can't guarantee it
so they can't sue me because I'm not
saying I know it or I have some inside
information but that's the signal
they've given us
and unless they change the signal you're
welcome to accept the signal that they
gave you
If somebody walks up to you and says I'm
a murderer and here's my track record
here's my here's my record of you're
allowed to believe them
if somebody tells you who they are you
know believe them the first time you
know that thing
so I think you're allowed to uh hate
every member of the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission because they've done
a huge disservice to this country simply
by not showing their work now let me be
clear
I'm not supporting predicted
I'm saying that if you make a change
this big you're the government if you
make a change this big without a reason
we get to assume it's the worst reason
and there's no wiggle room on that that
there's no negotiating you don't give us
a reason we we assume the worst reason
right do you remember uh years ago
I got for uh
saying that Obama should be impeached
because he changed his opinion on going
after uh weed dispensaries in California
so after we became president he changed
his campaign promise of not going after
them and went after him
now that alone is not a problem if he
had reasons
he didn't give the reason for his change
if you don't give the reason we have to
assume that he was he was bought off
so I've always assumed that Obama is a
criminal
because he told us he was
he told us he was
now he could change his message and I
would listen to it and I would consider
it but the message he told us directly
is that he's he's corrupt
and and you have to hear this every time
a politician changes an important policy
and won't give you a reason if they
won't give you a reason they are corrupt
and that's the best case that's the best
case the worst case is they're so
 incompetent that they don't know
they're giving you a reason is part of
the process if they don't even know
they're giving a reason it's important
that's even worse I'd rather have a
corrupt competent person in there at
least you know what's going on
so yes uh the commodity Futures Trading
commission every member there is a
corrupt piece of that's what they
told us
all right that's not my opinion that's
what they told us to think of them and
so I accept it
um
you have to see a thread by DACA Anarchy
that's name he goes by on Twitter doc
Anarchy
he's also got a sub stack
in which
I need an unauthorized sip
unauthoricep
much better
foreign
talks about on this thread are the
things a lot of things that you thought
were a good science
not so much it turns out that there
there are a number of things that you
just thought must have been you just
assumed
was long-settled Medical Science but
then you actually look at the science
and you're like uh maybe not I'll only
talk about one element to the threat but
he talks about a number of other
conditions Etc
and did you know that blood pressure
medication is highly correlated with
lowering your blood pressure
so the first thing that everybody agrees
on is that the pills do lower your blood
pressure
second thing everybody seems to agree on
no matter what your side you're on that
the lowering of your blood pressure is
correlated very strongly with lowering
of Strokes
everybody agree so that part of the the
science it seems like everybody agrees
including doc Anarchy and the studies
but here's the interesting part blood
pressure medication is not associated
with all cause extended mortality
did they say that right it's not
associated with living longer
so it seems to stop you from some
specific problems
but if you look at the all-cause
mortality where all the other possible
ways you could die they end up living
about the same
same length of time as anybody else
now I don't know if that means that they
live with disability
you know I suppose that's the next
question but here's why I trust that
you all know my story I've told it too
many times so recently I was on blood
pressure meds I'm not at the moment
and the blood pressure meds were killing
me
let me say it as clearly as I can they
were killing me and I could feel it
I could feel it and here's what I mean
specifically
they made me
um have almost non-stop thoughts of
suicide
the moment I stopped them completely
went away I haven't even had the
slightest like inkling of anything like
that like it doesn't even make sense
because my day looks fine oh I'm gonna
have a good day today yesterday was fine
tomorrow looks good too right and the
only difference the only difference was
I stopped the meds for one day
and then I stayed off and and my mood
stayed good the whole time
um
so
when I was on meds I did not care about
the quality of my life I could not
exercise physically I mean I tried
really really hard but I just couldn't
and I was I felt that my my Vitality or
what would be the word I was no longer
thriving
what's the word for that there's like a
word for that right where you're not
Vigor Vigor no there's another word like
my Vitality maybe vitality
something like that yeah so my sort of
purpose for living by stamina my Mo yeah
my dopamine all that stuff was gone now
I could tell that I would not have lived
as long
in that condition
and one of the other points on Doc
Anarchy substack
goes to why it turns out one of the best
things you can do for helping your
health and and Longevity is walking
every day
just walking every day that's all it
takes do you think I could walk every
day when I was on blood pressure meds
nope no let me be clear all meds are not
alike there's a whole bunch of different
blood pressure meds I'm not I don't know
if one of them would have worked without
side effects and I don't know if they do
or do not work for you I'm just telling
you my own experience
and
so what do you think would be better to
lower your blood pressure let's say 10
points from let's say 140 to I don't
know what let's say 140 to 120 or
something do you think that would be
better if you could not have exercise
for the rest of your life
I mean it's not even
there there's an obvious reason
why people on blood pressure medicine
don't live longer than other people it's
really obvious you would die of all the
other stuff
like every other problem should be
slightly magnified because you don't
care about living
right yeah do you know what kind of
risks I would have taken a month ago
that I would not take today there's a
big difference
a month ago I would have done something
that I knew could have killed me and I
wouldn't have given a I really
wouldn't have
I would not care one if I died last
month did not care today
I wouldn't do anything stupid
because I feel like hey tomorrow would
be fun I don't want to miss tomorrow
yeah so I recommend it because coming
out of the pandemic I feel like this is
a a tweet thread that would have been
harder to get away with before the
pandemic and also before Elon Musk
bought Twitter
and also before a sub stack because he
could write on substance so by the way
so let me recommend Dr Anarchy's sub
stack
uh which you can see more stuff like
this now the reason really is you get a
lot of contrarian uh non-mainstream
medical opinions from somebody who's in
the mainstream medical world so it's
pretty useful
yeah M lopidine was my my Med that's
right
um
so
uh my current blood pressure is exactly
perfect without any medications
I have a hypothesis
on lowering your blood pressure you
ready
you've seen a number of techniques that
lower your blood pressure from taking a
walk exercising a whole bunch of things
but one of the things that a lot of
these things have in common if you're
looking for the pattern
is exhaling
I feel like the exhale is where you get
all your benefits
there's one technique I don't know whose
it is one of you will tell me where you
take a big breath
and then you exhale
and when it's almost done you exhale
again it's like you really empty it
try this is it uh Wim Hof is it Wim Hof
Maybe
but here's what I learned that I feel
instantly
when I do that breathing technique you
can do it anytime
um
yeah you can do it anytime you could be
walking down the street and you you can
just go oh
oh
when you feel the second exhale when
your lungs are completely empty
feel your sort of anxiety
stress level that's sort of in your
chest area
completely gone
you could actually feel anxiety can you
not let me ask you this I feel like I
can do you feel anxiety like in your
body or just your mind you feel it in
your body right
you can make that anxiety feeling that
sometimes is with you all day long you
can actually make that completely go
away
with two exhales
now it doesn't stay that way
but if you can bring yourself down to
zero anxiety anytime you want
and I've started doing this multiple
times a day
right so instead of like sitting in one
place I'll just be walking the dog and
I'll just do it a few times
and I'll just be sitting at my desk
sometimes I'll be sitting at my desk and
I'll be working like take right now for
example
since I've been sort of concentrating on
what I'm doing for a while if I were to
monitor my body right now I can feel
I've got like a bunch of stress up here
not bad like pretty mild and I can feel
sort of an elevated
you know my whole body is elevated
because I'm doing this in front of an
audience
but
I could make that completely go away
this fast just watch
second exhale
totally gone
totally gone like my entire body
feels completely different than it did
30 seconds ago
I have a theory
that if you did that alone you wouldn't
need blood pressure meds if you're in
that you know say that the lower end of
the high blood pressure range just a
hypothesis and I'm trying it myself but
I'll bet you
I'll bet you it would work for all of
you
and here's the thing it works so
instantly that it's hard to doubt it
like it works instantly
all right
and take long walks
um
so here's some things we've discovered
lately now we know for sure that our
government has colluded
with uh
with social media and with the media
right so we know the government is
colluded with the media
I'm going to build a little case here so
just you know stick that to the side for
a second
um here's a story on CNN
who is being what I call woke silly I'm
going to make that one word
woke silly
it's more than woke
it's where you take walkedness all the
way to Selly
now let's see if I need to finish
the point all right so I'm just going to
give you the setup
and then I want all of you to complete
the hilarious ending of the story okay
just the setup
and then I'll be done
uh CNN is reporting um there's a report
by The Institute of diversity and ethics
and sports they found that uh there are
a very low percentage of black major
league baseball players
and they're feeling that that might be a
case of discrimination
and now
uh I'd like you to do the rest of it in
your minds okay complete it
Oh that's oh god
oh I'm doing it too you can do this at
home oh my god oh I guess I showed them
well look at this point how about this
Counterpoint ah you're all doing it
right
yes yeah NBA mostly black uh NFL mostly
black
prisons
too much you know black percentage right
um there are all kinds of things that
are like that is baseball the one that's
a problem
[Laughter]
that sounded racist but I'm gonna allow
it as funny
all right I'm going to tell you the joke
so over uh over on the on YouTube
somebody says it's the Jews
foreign
that's pretty funny actually I I love
jokes that when you first hear them you
think well is that racist but then you
have to think about it and you realize
it's the opposite it's not
all right it's just kidding it's not
really the juice
that was pretty funny that's a that's a
yay callback
all right well let me get to the good
news you ready
2016.
Free Speech came under attack
from wokeness would you agree
now you could argue about what year it
was but about 2016. wokeness became this
big cloud that made free speech
basically went away
right 2016.
Let's uh fast forward from 2016.
you've got Dave Rubin creating locals a
place where people like me can go and
not be censored uh because it's a
subscription Community
um you got Glenn Greenwald moving over
to substack
and suddenly he has complete free speech
over a sub stack you've got uh Elon Musk
buying Twitter oh look at that
a little bit of free speech and Russell
Brand has moved over to rumble I don't
know if he does he still have a YouTube
account or not but the the story is
that Rumble was now a serious business
obviously because Russell Brand has
moved and he's a serious content creator
and what did this do for me
add it all together what did it do for
me personally
what'd it do for me
it returned my free speech
it returned my free speech
I feel already that I can say things I
couldn't say last year
do you know why
because if I get canceled
I can go to locals I can go to sub stack
I can go to Twitter I can go to rumble
right I'm free
I'm free
and you know what did that
the free market
the free market now individuals did it
right thank you Dave Rubin thank you
Elon Musk you know thank you Rumble
creators thank you sub stack creators
right it was people who did it but those
people who were operating in the in the
free market
just just take a moment
to savor the beauty of this
in 1770 whatever when the when the
founders were building a system a
constitution
and they said you know let's let's have
some freedoms in the Constitution
free market was sort of you know assumed
in the system because it wasn't
prevented and they built a system to try
to last you know the the ages
that system for hundreds of years
supported freedom of speech you know
with ups and downs
and when he hit a speed bump in 2016
the founders reached through time and
space
and fixed it because the free market
fixed it
the free market fixed free speech
and you know what happens if the free
market dies or the free market gets
broken
Free Speech would fix it
so you got free speech that can fix free
markets you've got free markets that can
fix Free Speech it's a self-healing
system
now I suppose everything could go wrong
at the same time but we haven't seen it
yet
the the beauty of our system is just
breathtaking
it's just breathtaking
this thing reached through hundreds of
years
and fix this problem
right
how about racism at Harvard
racism at Harvard
that if you haven't seen the stats
I had no idea how badly Harvard was
discriminating against Asians and white
people
I I knew it was bad but you should see
the statistics
and I'm going to say something that
sounds horrible but I have free speech
now so I can say it
right I'm not even sure I'd say this a
year ago but I have now I have free
speech
if I see a black guy with a Harvard
Education
I'm going to assume he's not qualified
sorry
and is is that because I'm a racist nope
that's because that's what Harvard did
Harvard did that
I didn't do it the black guy didn't do
it what did the black guy do in this
hypothetical example did the black guy
do anything wrong no
no the black guy did everything right
black guy had a chance to go to Harvard
which means you know he did everything
right to prepare
and you know maybe the standards were
different but the black guy did
everything right I have no problem with
the black guy right I just won't assume
that he's competent just because he has
a Harvard and degree I would do
certainly opposite actually I would
assume that oh I can't really treat this
person like a Ivy League
person not that I would treat people
differently for that but
am I wrong
the Harvard has actually degraded their
own
um credentials
and I don't know if I could have said
that a year ago with you know complete
freedom
and also this lawsuit which looks like
it will go in the direction everybody
thinks that wouldn't have happened
unless
Trump had been elected
unless he put conservative justices in
there that's the only way that was going
to get you know revised I won't say
fixed because people have a different
idea of what what is right but it'll get
revised I think
all right now again look at the beauty
of the system a system built hundreds of
years ago by people who didn't even know
the internet was coming
and it reached through all that space
and time and fixed it looks like it's
going to fix this Harvard weirdness
uh Pete hegseth sent their diploma back
I don't know if I were Pete hegseth
uh I'd be pretty proud that I'm a white
guy and I still got into Harvard
I don't know if he had any help because
he was a veteran or anything I don't
know how that works
uh anyway but free speech has returned
and uh it's breathtaking honestly it is
um here's a small technology that is a
giant deal and could change my life
entirely tiniest little technology
so there's an AI that can now read your
podcasts
listen to them and they can index it
immediately so that you can search for a
Content within a podcast now if I
understand it correctly you could say
uh Hey AI
uh show me where uh Joe Rogan was
talking about Ivermectin
and it should take you right to that
time stamp
can you imagine that
because here's the thing a lot of the
most free speech people are doing what
I'm doing
I say it in audio and I keep it in a
written form
somewhat
somewhat uh intentionally
did you know that did you know that one
of the reasons I do this in audio form
is to make it less accessible
I do that intentionally yeah because I
only want the people who are willing to
put in the work to even hear what I have
to say you know the influential people
the people who care I don't want the low
information people to even have access
to my thoughts because low information
people are only going to cause trouble
right they don't boost anything
so at the moment I'm happy influencing
only people who really care enough to
you know find it
but imagine imagine if people like me
became instantly indexable
you could search for it
just think about that every single day
somebody sends me a YouTube video and
says oh there's something really
important in here uh and I don't watch
them
do you know why because it's an
hour-long video and I don't know I don't
know where it is in there
so but all that information that that
just hits a brick wall that'll be
unlocked the smartest podcasters in the
world would have their influence
increased by
on a factor of a hundred
now that's going to really change things
um consider my now here's another
technology that I'm sure
is available imagine telling an AI
to look at all of my live streams and
write a book
write a book with my name as the author
and just read all of my content and then
figure out you know get rid of the
duplicates
put them in themes and create a book
totally doable
totally doable
soon
um
let's see oh here's a
Joe Moore on Twitter he's a he's a good
fellow Joe Moore
um
he tweets this now a number of people
have been David boxhorn is is notable
have been pointing out that Israel
has very credible elections and it's
because they keep it really simple my
understanding is that one person walks
into a room to vote nobody else is there
but that person and a bunch of observers
and the the it's a paper paper ballot
and the paper ballots never leave the
room
and they get counted by you know
observers from all sides within the room
so basically they've created a system
where it's nearly impossible
to cheat
America has created a system where
is possible to cheat
you might get caught Etc but it's
possible
now let me ask you this if we know
there's a system that would be easy to
reproduce which is just one person in
the room and people witnessing if we
know it's easy to reproduce a nearly
foolproof voting system
but we choose not to
we choose not to
what's that tell you
well that's a choice
that's a choice
it's not an accident
the only thing you can conclude from
this is that both our Democrats and
Republicans
want the option of cheating
there's no other way to interpret that
am I wrong that both sides want the
option of cheating
because remember that you know within
the state if one if one side has control
of the election management they want to
keep it they want to keep everything the
way it is if it's working for them
so we do have a system that's designed
for cheating interestingly
let's talk about Twitter
here is the current preliminary thinking
from musk and I am blown away by the
speed of execution which again is the
new CEO play where you go in you make
some important changes right away and
then everybody says oh you know there's
a leader of means business and that
first impression really just stays
so the first impression is just awesome
um in terms of
let's say credible management
here's one thing we haven't seen yet
from Elon Musk that you're seeing with
Twitter
we've never watched him build a company
because most of it happens in you know
meetings
but he's actually managing Twitter
in public
very much in public because he's asking
our opinion at every move which is the
most amazing thing I've ever seen I've
never seen anybody develop a product in
person in public you know what about
this all right you don't like that how
about this
it's incredible
but here are some of the things that
look likely he's thinking uh he wants to
charge eight dollars per month to get
people a blue check but a blue check
wouldn't mean what it used to be under
the new world uh anybody could you know
pay to get verified I guess through some
kinds of steps it would level the
playing field more so they're not
special blue check people and and
poppers I guess he calls it but here are
some of the things you'd get for your
eight dollars per month
priority and replies
I don't know what that means
but my guess is that my reply would be
at the top of the reply list
would you guess that's what that means
because that would make me happy
I'd be happy to be at the top of the
reply list because that means that
people who were not verified to be real
people they might be Bots they might be
just troublemakers would automatically
be lower in the list
I would pay eight dollars a month for
that
totally because it would not just for my
own comments but to get rid of other
people's comments and get them lower in
the list so if that's what that means I
like it if it means something else I
might like it as well
uh he says ability to post long video
and audio
well of course of course oh why can't I
already do that is there some reason
that Twitter limits the length of my
audio let me ask you do you know how
many times I have tried to post what I
thought was a short video
to Twitter that I thought was awesome
like something I made myself
and I couldn't do it like I hit that
limit like oh that limit again I
would totally pay for that
absolutely for if you create content you
would pay for that
half as many ads now that's pretty
cheeky
half as many ads
I would definitely pay for no ads
but would I pay for half as many
damn it I would
damn it damn it I would yeah and I hate
that because I'll still see ads I would
prefer being able to you know I'd rather
pay nine dollars a month for no ads
but I can't say that the ads on Twitter
have ever bothered me which is why
Twitter doesn't make money right
if Twitter bothered me more with ads the
way YouTube would if you don't have a
you know the red tube thing
yeah I mean I'm not really bothered by
YouTube ads at all
but I'll take less that'd be good too
fewer
um there would also be Elon says an
extra tag for public figures
which I think is hilarious
so now instead of just a blue check
which sort of suggests I'm a public
figure
but you know there are lots of people
who are not so public who have blue
checks
um you'd have the blue check plus an
extra tag for a public figure
question am I a public figure under this
um
framing of things
it's not just politicians right
because politicians was the example
given but I think of a public figure I
think so
so
do you know what this would
all it's going to do is instead of
bragging or feeling good that I have a
blue check I'm just going to brag and
feel good that I have a blue check plus
an extra tag
some so instead of being the blue check
douchebags of which I'm a you know a
member
I will no longer be a blue check
douchebag
I'll be a blue check plus an extra tag
douchebag and I look forward to joining
that crowd
um and here's a really good one He
suggests that they're thinking about a
paywall bypass for Publishers willing to
work with Twitter meaning
how many times today have you clicked on
a link to a site that you couldn't read
because it's a subscription site
three times today I think for me
like all day long I'm clicking on things
I can't read
now imagine if all of those Publishers
could make a deal with Twitter
where you can read it if you come from
Twitter
but they get a they get a penny and and
Twitter gets a penny or something like
that
I know I feel like the Publishers would
make more money wouldn't they
I feel like they would
that seems like a great idea
and I also don't know why it doesn't
already exist
um
and then somebody asked if uh s musk on
Twitter do you think you could get some
scientific journals on board too
and he said I think so
now again I just have to back up for a
moment
and just marvel at what we're watching
in real time
the person who asked that question is
just a Twitter user
like it wasn't some famous person it was
just a Twitter user says do you think he
could get some scientific journals on
board too so that you could see them
past the paywall
he says I think so
since since when does the owner of a
gigantic company
entertain an idea in public and say I
think so
like the the fact that you didn't say
I'll look into it
look at the difference between I think
so and I'll look into it
do you feel that difference
I think so like gives you an actual
window into his mind you know exactly
what he knows
and where he's going
I love that the the
transparency of his thinking process as
he does it like in real time you're
getting the equivalent of an MBA just by
watching Elon Musk work in public
you are because you're seeing a business
model after business model you're seeing
all the the res the constraints being
brought into the fore you're seeing um
you know the competitive situation
you're seeing how he deals with the
government you're seeing how he's
replacing his marketing department with
himself tweeting you're seeing how he
can integrate you know one company into
a group of companies you see how he
manages public opinion
this is an MBA if you're not watching
this you're missing the best show on
Earth right now just in the same way
that Trump was an uh an advanced degree
in Persuasion and psychology
like if you watch Trump you learn stuff
you learned if if you were open to
learning you learned and if you watch
musk you're learning you're learning how
to run a business how to be an
entrepreneur just by watching his
thought process most amazing thing uh
it's just amazing
just amazing and how much better would
the world be
if you went to Twitter and you could
actually see an actual scientific
journal
you know of course there's a problem
whether we trust them but it's pretty
amazing stuff
anyway I think
that we have proved The Genius of the
founders of America
they've shown us that their system can
survive
assaults on Free Speech
because free markets have fixed it
and we've seen that the Adam's law of
slow-moving disasters continues to do
its thing
and
I think
we are entering a really good phase
now will the stock market take a huge
hit yes
if that bothers you then you're in the
stock market for the wrong reason or
you're nearing retirement which would be
bad timing
the stock market is supposed to take a
big hit
that's because everything's working the
way it's supposed to the stock market
got way ahead of itself
and now it's adjusting to where it needs
to be that's not bad news
that's good news
that's good news that means everything's
working the way it's supposed to
free markets the adjustments the you
know everything balancing everything out
you're watching a system
uh correction like you've never seen
before
I believe that the
um the fake news which was a big system
problem
was essentially broken by Trump but then
the fake news broke Trump in return
kick them out of office
but he's back
and Trump is going to come back and
finish off fake news along with Elon
Musk and along with sub stack and along
with locals along with Rumble along with
uh you know parlor and getter and and
and the other the other stuff
so
um
ever notice that Scott's moods tracked
the stock market uh a little bit
but not so much because I think the
market is poised to go lower today but
I'm in a very good mood so that would be
counter example
um love that Trump is being quiet Linda
says you know I think Trump may have
learned something from uh Biden
because the only way Trump can lose is
by talking
am I right
yeah he can say something that could get
him disqualified but if he just says
are going to do the exactly what you
think I'm going to do stay tuned
it'd be it'd be hard for him to lose
all right
so we're on the right track America is
getting ready to adjust would you say
that wokeness is on the way out
yes but like many things some of it will
be permanent
but not the worst of it right so I think
wokeness is on the way out how about ESG
which is part of wokeness ESG is being
assailed it's on the ropes
all right
uh what about uh defund the police
dead
right nuclear power up
at the moment it's hard to think of
anything that's not trending in the
right direction
again the economy and the inflation they
have to do what they have to do
so think of the economy sort of like a
machine
right
when you uh defrag your computer I don't
think anybody does anymore but but when
you do maintenance on your computer
you don't say my computer is worthless
you say oh this is the maintenance I
have to do so our economy is in a
maintenance mode
that's the best way to think of it the
economy is in maintenance mode and it's
going to stay a little bit less
available for our benefit than we'd like
for a while
and then when it gets out of maintenance
mode it will go up again that's exactly
how it's designed to go now there is one
thing that is not trending right which
is fentanyl but do you know what fix is
fentanyl
Trump
and if I were Trump
I would run for office saying uh the
cartels better get into that business
before election day
there's a story that I don't believe
that goes like this that when Trump
talked to Putin he told them if you have
Putin you know got adventurous with
Ukraine that he would attack Moscow
foreign
gets better now I'm not saying I believe
it that's just a report and then there's
a report that Trump when he talked to
she
told China that if they took Taiwan he'd
attacked Beijing
now I don't think those are credible
reports
but is it believable
yeah it is yeah it is I I'm not I
wouldn't I'm not going to say I believe
it that's going too far because I don't
think anybody has credible reporting
from Secret conversations but
it does sound like something he might
say
doesn't it and if if Trump said cartels
Trump could actually put a a death date
on the cartels
you could say you know there's this many
days until election and then
inauguration so pick inauguration date
as the date inauguration date 2025
if the cartels are not out of the
business
I'm going to take them out
what would happen
if you gave the cartels two years to get
out of the fence and all business but
not the other business right that's
still going to be a cat and mouse game
but if you said look that's a lie
you cross that line we're gonna we're
gonna level you
just give them a two-year notice and say
you're actually just going to disappear
in two years so you got time to change
things but you're going to disappear in
two years
yeah
they would assassinate them you know I
do worry about
Trump's safety
uh not what he's out of office but yeah
in general he's he's one that is he's
provocative so
you never know no it could be that the
reason that our government has never
attacked the cartels is that the leaders
are afraid
that that's possible I don't know that
that would affect Trump though
Trump might be the one political leader
who would say yeah they they might come
after me and then just do it anyway
right
all right
uh who is Robert Barnes somebody keeps
asking you don't know who Robert Barnes
is well let me introduce you to uh the
left-leaning audience
there there are some uh there's some
personalities and uh content makers of
the left that are unusually highly
credible all right
Robert Barnes would be in the highly
credible area for a lawyer who's who's
more associated with the right right so
um
so you should know there there's some
people you should know yeah and Barnes
is one of them
I like the fact that the political right
has developed a number of credible
people
have you noticed that
there's there's a bunch of people on the
political right who are not like
necessarily classically you know full
Republican or anything like that
it's not so much that the Republican
it's just a
yeah willing to fully uh evaluate the
rights opinions
so I would say Jonathan Turley would be
very high up in that category
very credible uh Bray Hume very credible
Tucker is more provocative that's that's
a different situation Tucker is a
National Treasure
but
you use a little more in the political
vein
Jordan Peterson is interesting
um
for lots of reasons
Glenn Greenwell yeah
so there are a number of people that you
can follow on the right that would never
embarrass you
you know what I mean like if there's
some characters if you you know
associate with them you say oh God you
did that and then you have to explain
away why you ever liked them in the
first place but there's a whole bunch of
people on the right who just aren't like
that
they're they're just actually
legitimate you know people
yeah Megan Kelly I'm saying other names
go by gadsad Geraldo
geraldo's uh
I wouldn't call him a voice on the right
he Associates with the left he just
likes Trump and he's also open-minded
um
yeah
I saw Dana Perino go by as a name I saw
Greg goffeld famously more open-minded
than a lot of the TV people
uh Victor David Hansen is
um
recommended of course so if you wanted
to see what the let's say most
intellectual members of the right are
saying then you'd want to follow Victor
David Hansen yes
I I don't know if he's as um
let's say flexible about any benefits
that are happening on the left I don't
know if that's the case so just be aware
of that
John Stossel good example
open-minded not associated with one side
you know in a in a crazy way Rick Wilson
yeah Thomas Soule is another Thomas you
know we should make a list
that would be interesting I guess we
never agree on the list but there should
be a list of people you could listen to
on the right without having your head
explode
how about that
how about that
if you could give people on the left a
reading list or a follow list that's
like okay we we get how Trump makes you
crazy
right we get how you know Mike cernovich
might make you crazy
but here's a list of people who won't
make you crazy
who just say things that are compatible
with the right so if you want to see
what the reasonable arguments look like
follow these this group that would be
really useful wouldn't it
yeah I don't know if I'd make the list
or not
a micro
do you know micros politics I don't
would you even associate micro with the
right
I I don't think it's fair to say that a
guy who thinks that work is respectable
is necessarily a Republican
look let's go too far
I'm almost positive there are Democrats
who value work
almost positive
all right
uh yeah micro seems more like the the
common sense middle type of person
uh
Tyrus
Tyrus is an interesting voice
you have to be careful about the people
who are not as established yet
so the Tyrus is doing a great job
managing his career and if you're
watching that it's real fun to watch
just watching how he's putting the
pieces together and becoming you know a
substantial voice
from you know maybe being more of a
stunt casting to actually becoming
substantial now and contributing to
other shows Etc so that's a real fun
it's real fun to watch that growth
he's doing a great job
um
Like Jesse Watters did
all right I think that's all I got for
today
um sticks and hammers a good good
recommendation Clay Davis Tulsi yeah
yeah they're a lot you you could
actually have a very long list of
reasonable people who lean right who are
not necessarily even Republicans right
right so all right that's all for now
YouTube I'll talk to you tomorrow
