hey everybody
this is a test i have no idea how many
people are going to show up for this
because i don't usually use youtube live
but i've been playing with my uh my
options
and i thought i'd see how this works one
of the things i'm testing
is to see if my uh earpods are working
as a microphone because they work with
some apps but they don't work with
others
oh we have four people here amazing
hey todd how's everybody
is this sound good all right tell me
something
i'm gonna i'm gonna walk away and see if
the sound
gets less because if the sound goes down
when i turn away it means that the air
pods are not working okay
see if the air pods are just as good now
as they were when i was standing close
to it or
do they get louder if it gets louder
right now it means my airpods are not
working
how'd that work were the airpods working
just as good still working hey
good all right you know the weirdest
thing is that the
uh the apple airpods are not compatible
with the apple
uh video app that comes with the phone
hey great should be pretty good sound so
i'm going to be watching the
debates tonight and we'll be live
tweeting
how about you
periscope app you don't like the
periscope app
you know the advantage that the
periscope app has and the reason i use
it
is that it's integrated with twitter so
it's just sort of seamless you just get
on
periscope and it alerts everybody on
twitter
and it's just real simple so i don't
want to stop using periscope
but youtube has not been good to me
that's that's why i have an account on
locals
so i moved to the locals.com uh
subscription service for for the stuff
that i don't put
in the public
um all right this is a pretty good
interface looks like the
picture is good
and that's about what i wanted to test
all right i'm going to do one more test
while you're here are you ready
you're you're all part of this
experiment and the experiment goes like
this
hold on just a moment for the next part
because when i do my periscopes i do
them with
an ipad i want to see if i can
do two things at the same time and still
get sound
so i'm going to use my plug-in lavalier
microphone
that i use for the ipad and then i'm
gonna
at the same time that i'm going on to
periscope
i am going to do this and see if they
work at the same time
exciting huh all right
here's the test i'm gonna put them in
the same place
hold on here bear with me
i don't know why any of you would be
watching this but i'm glad that you are
all right
let's see if this works
all right so i've got my phone sitting
uh
in front of my ipad so that i can see
both of them
in theory i can go live right now which
i'm doing
all right i'm live on periscope and i am
live on youtube at the same time
so this is just a uh an experiment to
see how it works
we've got uh 700 people pouring in here
on
periscope all right i don't want to
disappoint anybody
this is just a technology test i want to
see if i can upgrade my situation
so for if you're just joining what i
what i'm doing right now is i'm
i have two devices i've got my iphone
sitting directly in front of my ipad
both of them are on both of them are
live
one of them is on periscope and one is
on youtube
uh and uh hey bill
somebody says wrong again scotty
um so i actually didn't have much to say
but
since you're all here i'm gonna i'm
gonna tell you something interesting
anyway
if you haven't seen it yet there's a a
youtube site i think it's a
bombardier's body language or
bombier's body language in which
she looks at famous people doing things
and tells you whether they're uh
do some politics all right i'll do i'm
doing some politics
and she tells you if they're lying or
whatever based on their body language so
she looked at biden to try to determine
if he's using an earpiece
and she looked at him talking with
anderson cooper at a town hall and
the tell that she thinks is real and i'm
not
on board with believing he has an
earpiece
he might have an earpiece he might i'm
not going to rule it out
but if i had to bed i'd bet no just
because it's
a little too on the nose it's you know
just
i'm just not thinking the world is that
clever but maybe
it could happen anyway so the the tell
that you should be looking for
is that if he pauses and he looks away
instead of looking at who he's talking
to uh
allegedly that's to tell that he's
listening
so in other words the the idea is that
it's hard to listen to one person while
you're making eye contact with
a third party is that true
maybe i mean it sounds possibly true
and so she showed a number of examples
where
uh when he looked away or looked to the
side it was like he was listening
for something now i'm not going to buy
the conspiracy theory that he has an
earpiece
but i want to put this thought in your
head
what if trump brings it up during the
debate
now of course it could backfire because
he could get mocked for
bringing up a conspiracy theory that has
no basis right
so it could definitely work against him
but imagine if you will
that biden starts talking or or he uh
let's say he hesitates or he pauses and
and trump
talks over him and says well what does
your earpiece say
the moment he suggests that biden is
listening to the earpiece
at that moment it'll be the best tv
you've ever seen in your life
this is what spy isn't going to do is he
going to is he going to show him his
ears
which which would look very
unpresidential look in my ear
look at my ear what's he going to do so
if you give
biden any kind of a a challenge
that he is not accustomed to uh
that's that's of course the place to go
you want to give him something he's
never had to answer never had to deal
with before something brand new
and in theory he won't be able to handle
it so we'll see
have you seen joe's confused stupid look
his mouth actually hangs open when he's
when he's in his
full dementia look have you seen it
it looks like this
where he has just like vacant eyes and
his mouth literally hangs open
and then other times when he's he's in
battle mode and he's having
you know he's having a high energy
moment
he does the over smile
that looks totally fake because it
doesn't match his eyes
he's got angry eyes his eyes are totally
just off
but he's smiling yeah look at my smile
the smile tells you that i'm not
bothered by the attacks at all
i'm not angry i'm not angry and i'm not
bothered by them at
all so that's my favorite joe biden look
um
well then why did he back off of being
inspected if he didn't have one
so the the official reason or at least
the one you'll see on twitter is that
you don't want to
you don't want to honor such a
ridiculous request
by treating it like it could be real so
you just
dismiss it now in what world
do you not spend five seconds going all
right
look here look there conspiracy theory
handled there's there's no no doubt
about it now
five seconds look here look there done
now is it a good idea not to spend those
five seconds
to eliminate what what will definitely
be
you know if there were any doubt about
it it would be one thing
but you know if he doesn't address it
you know
that's going to be the talk the next day
is about the earpiece
so i think it's a oh thank you it's uh
bombard's body language i think it is
now it might who knows maybe it's been
deleted
it could be that it didn't pass some
kind of standard or something all right
i was actually not planning to be on
here so this was just a technology test
i am going to sign off and i will talk
to you later
all right i've signed off periscope
those of you on
youtube thanks for coming and thanks for
uh doing this
body language ghost um is that the name
of the website
i see a number of you saying something
about
body language ghost so maybe that's it
turn on super chat somebody says
um does that mean it's not on
if i can see your chats uh
does that mean super chat is not on i
don't see that option let me see
i do not see a super chat
button maybe this thing
what's that top chat live chat
i don't know i don't know what super
chat is
i have to look into that um it looks
like the
quality is better right
somebody says it's definitely not on for
me what is super chat
i don't use youtube so i'm not sure i
know the difference between regular chat
and super chat
um quality is much better
all right well good so part of the
reason the quality is better is that
this is on my
iphone
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you later
