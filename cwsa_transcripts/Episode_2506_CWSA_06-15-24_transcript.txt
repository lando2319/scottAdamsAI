H where is everybody
today let's make sure I can see all my
comments all right comments online
looking
good all our technology is working
today if it looks like I'm stalling to
make sure everybody's here for the
simultaneous zip well that's exactly
what I'm doing it's called stalling
but I'm almost ready because everybody's
pouring
in good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams cuz
that's kind of what it is and if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their smooth tiny human brains all
you need for that is a cup or mug or a
glass of tanker CH d a canteen jug a
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dope mean head of the day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens
now ah technology on point everything's
working
today well let's uh let's give a little
thank for our experts shall we you know
experts get a bad rap especially lately
but what would we do without them here's
a case in point uh finally after long
last Co long Co has a
definition now that's what we needed
because long Co everybody was all over
the place like what is it how do you
identify it how do you know you had it
you know what does it even exist but
finally the experts have come together
and they've decided that the definition
of long Co is as follows it has to
happen after
Co so it can't be before
Co that seems to be built into the
definition right so you can't get covid
before there was covid so the experts
have clarified that it could only be
long Co if you've had Co now that's a
good first step but it gets
better and it could be identified by any
one of 200 symptoms that may come and go
during the rest of your
life so finally we have a little Clarity
is something that happened after you had
Co any time in your life and could
include any one of 200 symptoms that may
come and go for reasons you don't
understand and that's called long Co now
other people have called
that well various names uh old age old
age cuz that happens to me after
Co and I think I get about 200 symptoms
I get about 200 symptoms a day now uh
and that's just the first five minutes
after I wake up I'm like Oh my back oh
you know that sort of
thing so it's probably uh must have some
long
Co um companies are discovering that all
their big AI projects that were going to
save the money and change the nature of
the world have uh hit what some call the
Troth of
disillusionment and that it's not really
changing the world the way they thought
and a lot of projects are
stalled um I could have told you that
the reason I could have told you that is
I tried several projects myself I tried
to use AI to do a bunch of things that
would be completely relevant to what I
do for a living and I thought man I'm
going to be the first
one I I'm going to be the one who's the
first cartoonist
to to use AI in like a real cool way is
really going to impress you I can't get
a thing to
work it it's fun to talk to it and use
it for education and stuff but to
actually turn it into a tool that you
that I can use in my work nope no luck
at all uh I do hear that there's some
upgrades to the deli AI system which
I've been trying to build an agent in
and and ran into some obstacles in terms
of what it could or could not do but the
company was very responsive and they say
in a week or so they're going to have a
bunch of uh fixes and whatever so that I
can get it to do what I want so I'm
open-minded about it maybe but I'll let
you know so far
AI um because it's gives unreliable
answers to things there's just a whole
host of things you thought it would do
that it can't ever do because if you
can't if you can't know that it will
give you the right
answer what is
it it's like a person you have a
conversation with if you have a
conversation with somebody and they give
you some wrong fact you know we kind of
discount that as that's the way
conversations go but if you're asking
for data and it sometimes just gives you
the wrong data and you don't know why
and you can't fix it uh that doesn't
work at all
so I do think AI is going to be as big
as everybody says but there's probably a
gigantic percentage of it that will
never
work at least during using the llm
technology it might work in some future
iteration but not
now well I was watching the five last
night and I saw a story there's a new
trend uh sort of nonobvious
uh and as the Chiron read um on the five
women are falling for guys who look like
cartoon mice which they they refer to as
hot rodent men so men who have that Vibe
of looking sort of roughly like a rat
are becoming a little bit more
popular now this was good news for me
um my patience has finally paid off and
it looks like it's my time to shine so
good luck to the rest of you handsome
looking people because your day came and
went no it's time for the rat-faced
people to rise and I might be their
leader I might be but not just
that let's look at the other
science um there's a study from Japan
that says if you eat small fish whole
like the entire fish bones and all uh
it's really really good for your health
because apparently all those bones and
things are are good for you
now I'm not super surprised about that
because yesterday I was watching a video
of a slow motion capture by a looked
like a Golden Eagle catching a fish and
popping it in his mouth and eating a
hole and I thought to myself
hey that uh that that Golden Eagle isn't
even chewing it's actually just going
and like swallowing a fish hole and so I
said to myself I wonder if the the whole
fish is
healthy apparently it is apparently
there's not much more better you could
do than eat a whole
fish but here's the uh question I ask
why is it so consistent that if there's
something good for you it's also
horrible to
do like could they come up with anything
worse like I expect tomorrow will be and
science has discovered that if you can
shove 10 pine cones up your own ass
you will add 10 years to your
life and I'll be like but I don't want
to shove pine cones up my ass that
sounds really painful and people will
say well I mean if you don't care about
your health you can do it your way no
now I got to eat a whole fish and shove
pine cones up my ass every everything's
too
hard well here's a surprising surprising
result of a study thanks to science we
have determined remember you used to
hear from women that if only men would
help with the housework after they got
home from working all day that then
they'd want to have more sex with them
and so we were told that the sexiest
thing you could do Ben was do the dishes
and vacuum while your wife is
watching and a lot of you said finally
I've cracked the code all I have to do
is a little extra dusting put this apron
on cook some food clean up after myself
take care of the kids and I'm going to
get some to Super action
wow that's what I was told for probably
20 years 30
years well in a new study says uh turns
out that helping with the housework uh
gets you less sex for heterosexual
married Partners yeah so the man will
get less sex and I guess that means that
the woman would get less sex if
everything's working out the way it
should uh
um
so if you uh want to do well with the
ladies you should look more like a
rat-faced boy and less like some kind of
handsome thing nobody wants that so look
like a rat-faced person um you want to
not help with the uh the hous work that
appears to be good for your sex life and
I'd like to add my own little twist um
you'll see this from S as well Shaquille
O'Neal said this the other day in a
video never share your
feelings no no did you ever fall for
that trap how many of you have ever
fallen for the Trap of sharing your
feelings how'd that work
out so here's my advice to you look like
a rat-faced boy don't communicate with
your lover and whatever you do don't
help out around the house
and uh you will be amazed how much punon
Tang you're
getting so there's your relationship
advice from the single guy who's not in
relationship and uh if that doesn't
frighten you is
should there's a startup in
India that printed a rocket
engine uh in 72 hours using a 3D
printer they printed a rocket ship
and then sent the rocket up and it
worked they printed rocket ship or
rocket engine they printed it in 72
hours that's amazing that's like one of
the Imp most
impressive technology things I've ever
heard of in my life now let's take it to
the next level if you can 3D print
something as sensitive and Powerful as a
rocket engine
how far are we from 3D printing a small
modular nuclear
reactor
suddenly suddenly if you could get rid
of the you know burdensome regulations
but not the ones you need if you get rid
of
regulations and you could Co you could
locate the new reactors let's say where
they're already nuclear power plants and
you could keep the waste there which is
the new way they do it in some cases
they can reuse the waste for fuel for
other types of reactors if you could do
all that and then you could have a
standardized design that's approved by
the government and all the Regulatory
Agencies and your biggest problem was
actually
manufacturing you might be able to 3D
print
it imagine if you could 3D print a
preapproved no own model of a small
modular nuclear
reactor now you might say to yourself I
don't want to be the first one to live
next to the 3D printed nuclear reactor
but I would have said that about going
up at a
rocket if they can make it safe enough
for a
rocket I don't know seems like they
might be able to make it safe enough for
a nuke with a little extra work
maybe that's a that's one of those
boring little stories that might be like
one of the biggest deals in the whole
universe could be meanwhile there's a
Turkish student who is trying to pass
some uh difficult entrance exam and uh
cleverly used a hidden camera and a
button that would look at the test and
it would use AI to solve the test
questions and then read it into a
earpiece so the guy was listening to the
answers while the the button was looking
at the the test
and he got
caught
now I feel like I would have wanted to
hire that guy in the
spot because because if his system
worked it's kind of impressive it's like
huh if you can do that yeah I'd like you
to work for me anyway uh it seems like
there's going to be a lot more of
that that type of
cheating well the New York Times is
reportedly they got rid of like nine out
of the 16 of their uh artists who were
on
staff and they did it because that some
say it's because of AI but I think the
New York Times says no no it's just
cross cutting
um but the uh the
Union uh for the workers at the New York
Times uh said that uh firing artists and
replacing them with with AI that the the
union said and I quote I thought we were
better than this
better than
this is the union actually a communist
organization what do they mean by better
I thought better was companies um hire
people when they need people and they
fire people when they don't need people
and it's called it's called it's called
capitalism it's called capitalism that
would be the system that we're living
under allegedly but according to the
union who apparently are communists I
thought we were better than this better
than what capitalism if you're better
than
capitalism what's the name of that what
what are you calling the thing that's
better than hiring and firing depending
on the business's needs what's better
than that
communism I can't think of anything else
they'd be talking about so apparently
the employees of the New York Times
are literally Communists or socialists
or something but they don't understand
this whole capitalism thing
well here's the good news and bad news
uh let's see if you could have predicted
this uh if you haven't read the story I
want to see how long it takes you to
predict the ending of this this news
event right so involves
California so put on your California
thinking
cap involves the drought which
California had had for years which is
now solved it turns out that California
is just flush with water got plenty of
water
at the same
time they're going to deny Farmers uh
they're going to cut a lot of the
farmers back to only 40% of the federal
water they were supposed to get I guess
there's Federal water and other water
but it'll be a major p pullback in the
water
why all right it's
California and there's plenty of water
plenty of water everybody agrees but the
farmers will not be allowed to get
uh nearly as much water as I need why
would that be you tell me it's
California oh let me guess oh let me
fill you in it's because of an
endangered fish there's a problem with
an endangered
fish
yep so is that the most California thing
you've ever heard in your
life uh years ago before I built the
house that I'm living in right now I
thought I was going to build it in a
different place I bought several Acres
down the road and when I went to uh look
into building on it turns out they had
uh maybe some endangered fish in the
Little Creek that was dry most of the
time or frogs or something I forget what
it was but I've actually been limited
from building for a fish or a frog that
nobody has ever seen and by the way
there weren't any there it just looked
like a place that might be some
endangered fish or something like it's
actually insane trying to get anything
built in California I don't recommend it
by the way I wouldn't do it at all um
but anyway so this endangered fish I
don't know how endangered it is or how
important it is because frankly I've
never I've never missed that
fish um but apparently you could eat
that fish whole and it would be really
good for you uh but don't it's an
endangered fish so even though it'd be
very healthy to eat a whole don't do
that it's endangered so what are the
farmers going to do well I don't know
but the only thing I can think of is if
the Farmers can't get water for their
crops uh they might be able to get the
huge masses of illegal migrants uh to
urinate on
them I mean I don't know if that would
help but it's better than nothing
right that's just my idea all right the
Oakland reparations committee it wants
$5
million and you're going to say well
that's that's not nearly as much as I
thought Oakland's a pretty big place and
the reparations committee is only asking
for $5 million and I I saw that and I
thought
huh that might actually be something we
could talk about because you know we
wouldn't miss $5 million in our our
taxes and then I read it more carefully
no they don't the reparations Committee
in Oakland they don't want $5 million
for
reparations they want $5 million from
taxpayers to come up with a
plan for the
reparations 5 million to work on a
plan now as a person who lives in the
Oakland
area what should I do to avoid uh being
penalized for being
white by having to pay for some
reparation that I had nothing to do with
what should I do should I get the
out of
there can can we be adults for like a
minute I didn't create the
system I mean I'm just in the system
it's not my fault if the system makes it
more expensive to live in a state where
there is a big black population you
should get out of there or at least it
should be one of your
factors if you live anywhere in a place
where Dei is a big emphasis you should
get the out of there if you're
white or Asian American you should get
out of there because you don't have any
options you can't fight it and why would
you stay where things are bad the number
one thing that I teach people about
Career Success is if you can't do it
where you are get the out of there
it's the very first thing I did when I
graduated college cuz my hometown was a
tiny little town with you know no real
industry or anything like that except
tourism and the first thing I did is
moved to the California Bay Area before
even knowing what I'd do for my life
because you have to go where the
opportunity is so at the moment
California is becoming kind of a hell
hole I wouldn't recommend anybody move
to it it's just really hard to move out
of it and believe me I've been doing a
lot of
research they've got these clawback
Provisions they can tax you even if you
leave you know demonstrating that you
really left if you if you visit a lot
it's going to be problem yeah California
is just a piece of right
now but it has lovely weather and if you
can afford it that part's
great well the uh Stanford had this
weird disinformation Research Center
which turned out to be just a place
where the government would work with
these I don't want to call them fakes
but they were obviously people working
on the censorship industrial complex and
they just closed down because they had
so much heat but I don't trust it do do
you think that just because this
prominent censorship entity got closed
down do you do you think do you think
that they're not going to do any
sensoring I assume they just got more
clever about it don't we assume that
outside of X the platforms are all doing
the same same kind of bad stuff maybe
just more cleverly so in other words
instead of kicking somebody off a
platform maybe just nobody sees their
posts I haven't hear I haven't heard as
much complaining about it this year have
you it used to be that it was just so
obvious uh the censorship that it was
just continuous complaining because you
couldn't miss it it was everywhere but I
really haven't heard it so far the cycle
does that suggest that we're actually
getting some kind of control over that
or we just don't know where it is now
see what I what I fear is that it's just
a whacka mole situation and we whacked
this Stanford disinformation Research
Center I mean collectively we whacked
it but it doesn't mean it didn't just
pop up somewhere else under a different
name I assume that's what's
happening all right the U Supreme Court
struck down the Trump uh era ban on bump
stocks I guess
so if it's not a
ban you can have them now that was a
weird one because you wouldn't expect
anybody Trump related to want to ban
anything gun
related but if you don't follow gun
stuff the so-called bump stocks would
turn your gun into a wildly inaccurate
instrument and so the gun people said
who the hell would want to use a bump
stock if it just makes your gun less
accurate like the the one and only time
you'd use it would be that you know
Vegas shooting when you're shooting into
a gigantic crowd and accuracy didn't
really matter because you weren't aiming
at a specific person anyway but short of
that I'm told that if you you know had a
handgun and went into someplace with bad
intentions and just carefully shot you
would do more damage than a bump that's
just going to be firing bullets into the
ceiling as much as the anything
else so I don't think it matters these
this bump stock thing is is such a small
little thing makes no difference to
anybody I don't
think all right I continue to ask the
question of why voting machines exist if
they're not cheaper or more secure or
making us feel more credible and they're
not faster why there was a gentleman I
saw on social media here who asked his
local town to explain why they use
machines and they said something about
them being more efficient to R able or
something clearly not true clearly not
true so why do we have
them now other people have said that uh
well you know if it produces paper you
can always be you can always double
check because you just look at the paper
but apparently there are cases where it
doesn't produce paper and there you know
we know this PTO Rico had just all kinds
of trouble with their voting machines
and I guess they didn't produce paper
RFK Jr is basically saying you can't
trust the voting
machines and unless it unless it creates
paper so he would do legislation that
says you can keep your voting machine
but it's got to create a piece of paper
so we can check to see if it was
real is that
enough I don't know I don't
know but let's check in with the
rasmuson folks who like to keep us
updated on various claims of
irregularity in voting from 2020 so
here's what we believe we know from the
mar Maricopa County one of the most
question uh voting election results in
2020 here's what we know there was only
one legal type of paper that could be
used and there are credible uh
allegations that there were up to 10
different types found now do you know
why there's only one uh one type of
paper that's approved for an election in
a in a given area does anybody know why
they say you can only use one piece of
paper my first thought was oh it's
because they know that this kind of
paper is accepted by the machines that
was my first thought you you want to
make sure it can be processed through
the machines when they count you don't
want any cheap paper that gets caught in
the machines but it turns out that's not
really the
reason that's maybe one of the reasons
they make sure that the paper works but
the other reason is to make sure that
there's no
fraud do you know how they can detect
the
fraud if somebody use the wrong
paper it's a fraud
detection now for some reason that
didn't immediately occur to me I just
assumed it was a functional question and
that if they used other paper but the
machines accepted it I was thinking well
that's not big problem is it what's the
problem so they ran into paper some
people didn't get the memo they just use
whatever paper was available it worked
fine no problem but then once you
realize that the limitation of the paper
is a major way that they prevent fraud
and then you see that there were
credible reports of 10 different papers
used that would pretty much be
guaranteed fraud if you could prove this
is true it's hard to imagine it would be
anything but exactly what it looks like
now is it proven I don't know because
it's hard to believe anything in the
election domain because so many things
are found not to be true so but that
claim still stands meaning that no court
has said it's not true there's no court
that said no that didn't happen so the
claim is out there what whatever status
it is it's out there here's another
one uh within Maricopa County there was
one legal software version only one that
was legal but two versions uh and a
compiler were found the compiler was
capable of creating executable files and
then deleting them without
detection but there is some some
evidence that it did is did so three
times during the
election what why is your compiler
creating and executing files and then
deleting them what what would be the
legal reason to do that I don't know
maybe there is some legal reason you
know anything anything nothing would
surprise me at this point but uh
certainly everything about that looks
fraudulent but remember don't get fooled
by
Krakens there there are tons of times
since 2020 that uh both you and I
probably heard a report and you said to
yourself oh this time that's a Smoking
Gun then maybe it turned out not to be
so you should always keep a real real
real open mind
about any specific
claims but I take the argument from
specific claims to the general the
general is what are the odds that this
is the only non-corrupt system in the
United
States I'd say
zero just common sense and and if you
say We'll prove it then I'll say well
how about I don't have to prove it how
about I just show you that every single
other system can be hacked and has been
and if every if anything that can be
gamed is being gamed everywhere all the
time that's the way the world works so
the fact that you didn't catch it
probably doesn't mean
anything because people presumably would
figure out how not to get caught so I
don't have any proof that there's any
kind of election irregularity all I have
is the common sense that of course it is
of course it
is why why would it be true if it
doesn't need to be and somebody can
benefit from Faking
it it seems unlikely that it's a fair
system um you know that President Trump
floated the idea of having a uh having
more tariffs on incoming products from
other countries and getting rid of the
income tax and I saw a a long post by
BAGI sh nasan in which he's explaining
there's actually there's an historical
presedent because apparently before the
income tax that was actually a big way
that the United States funded
itself and it's actually possible that
we could do
it uh but as BAGI points out it probably
would take 10 years of economic pain
like we haven't experienced since maybe
the Great Depression so I mean he didn't
say the Great Depression part I just
added that myself it's just it would be
very disruptive to make that kind of a
change but it's not impossible and it
has some benefits and the benefits are
that it would make the country run like
a it would make the country run like a
company that's trying to make money so
we would try to sell our Goods to other
people and make more
money than uh than the other people were
making by selling to us basically so we
would charge them for incoming stuff so
their stuff was more expensive which
would make it more profitable to build
it internally and then manufacturing
could move back to America because the
tariffs would make it expensive to buy
things from other places now if you add
robots plus 3D printing and some tariffs
you could pretty easily imagine the
manufacturing coming back to America
first slowly and then quickly right once
we get all the transportation and the
electrical and everything worked
out it might happen quickly after it
goes slowly for a while
anyway the biggest problem is that our
current process as baji points out is
that we just print money when we want to
and it wouldn't work if you had a tariff
if you had a tariff you'd have you'd
only have that money but if you can just
print
money suddenly oh here's another
trillion dollars so how do you how do
you tell yourself to stop printing money
just because the system is collapsing if
you keep doing it hasn't stopped us
yet so yeah it's probably impossible
from a bureaucratic point of
view here's a question I
have how big are the election
whistleblower rewards uh this
year and don't tell me there aren't any
because that would be
crazy are are we are you telling me that
it's not obvious that if you were to
find some trouble in
2024 and if you reported it and let's
say if it's big enough that it would
make a difference there's no re
reward here's why you need a
whistleblower reward in advance all
right so Lura
Trump um you should be listening to this
there should be it should be known in
advance that there will be a huge amount
of money to any Democrat or anybody else
who comes up with the goods like an
actual
prosecutable large form of fraud here's
why you want to create a situation where
people who have to get other people
involved with their fraud which probably
would be the case if anybody was doing
anything yeah it would take some
insiders you know you need somebody to
drive a truck maybe somebody to unlock a
door somebody to turn the other way so
probably any form of election cheating
hypothetically again I'm not aware of
any proven um forms in 2020 but
hypothetically if someone was planning
an OP of that size other people would be
involved and if you had a big enough
reward you can guarantee that the people
who were involved in it would have to
kill all the other people
involved to avoid The Whistleblower
imagine putting a plot together all
right the five of us are going to do
this plot and we're going to cheat in
the
election and uh but when it's done any
one of the five of us can go collect a
million dollars just by turning in the
other
four so what are you going to do are you
going to be part of that plot or are you
going to say yes and make sure you're
the first one to turn it in because if
you're not the first one to go
whistleblower the first person gets a
million dollars and you get jail
time so what would you do well the first
thing is it would create a situation
where the leader of the plot would have
to murder all the underlings after the
plot was executed because you couldn't
have somebody out there who could make a
million
dollars and before they were just
driving a truck or they were the janitor
that unlocked the
door right you can't have somebody out
there with like a million dollars to
gain if they Buck the
system so there should be a very large
award reward in advance that everybody
knows about that says if you find some
things it has to go through the court of
course it have to be Court uh Court uh
confirmed but if you don't have that it
looks like hey you can give me $100 to
open this door I'll take
it will you talk to anybody about it nah
I'll just keep the
$100 so you got to make it too expensive
to
cheat you see where I'm going in this
make it too expensive to cheat because
somebody's going to drop a dime like too
much to
gain well on the plus side remember I
told you that Lara Trump seemed like the
right person for the co-chair of the RNC
because you needed somebody who had a
predator
mindset and I'm going to say this in a
positive way if in case it sounded
insulting it's not meant to be Laura
Trump has Predator written all over
her do you would you agree with that
let's put it this way um if you look at
somebody like uh you know Adam Chef you
might be an a little troll but he
doesn't look like a
predator yeah he looks like
prey in the wild he'd be the first one
that the lion ate but but Laura Trump
would be the
lion right so she's got I think she has
all the qualifications that you need for
somebody who's going to just really make
it happen and apparently she's put
together a pretty major effort for poll
Watchers and Watchdogs during the poll
now that's the thing you were waiting
for isn't it weren't you waiting to find
out that the Republicans were actually
going to do something for
once it turns out she is and it's pretty
big and it probably will make a big
difference because you don't have to
have them everywhere you just have to
have them in the key places
so uh this is part of a theme of
everything seems to be going Trump's way
at the
moment we'll get into more Trump stuff
but now that that we know what could
have happened it looks like the
censorship machine is at least being
wounded if not dismantled it looks like
the people who are going to watch the
elections going to watch it a lot more
carefully and by the way we still don't
have an answer of why we use electronic
counting
machines nobody's even offered an
explanation how far do you think we can
go into the election cycle without
anybody anybody anywhere offering a
counterarguments like oh yeah the
machines are good
because it's going to get more and more
embarrassing the longer we go with
nobody even trying to answer the
question and and suppose somebody does
answer the question even that's bad
because why didn't the public know about
any of that why why is it we don't know
why you're doing it we should know that
should be kind of transparent we're
doing it because maybe it's a good
reason Maybe
anyway
um you know if you ever heard that
saying those who ignore history are
doomed to repeat
it sounded pretty smart when the first
time you heard it h if I ignore
history I I'll fall into those same
traps of the people in history so I
better understand my history so I I know
what works and what doesn't
work well that would make sense if
history were real but we know the
history is completely made up because we
know that the current news is completely
made
up what will the news say about the uh
the January 6
protest they're already calling it an
Insurrection no Insurrection happened
but that will be the news and someday
will people will look at the history
books and say hm that was a terrible
Insurrection back there in January
6 and it won't be real but it'll be
history so I'm updating that to those
who ignore history are less
misinformed the more you know about
history the Dumber you get so when I
hear the historians especially the
presidential historians weighing in as
experts I think to myself your entire
industry is built around
 you're actually analyzing the
entrails of people who lied to you
you're not even looking at the history
you're looking at the Endra of the liars
and telling me what you think will
happen in the future the dumbest thing
ever so the I wondered how many other
old sayings were complete so
the whole thing about learning from
history is ridiculous be
yourself worst worst uh advice ever
don't be
yourself that's terrible idea figure out
what would be a better version of
yourself and try to work toward that
you're not
done you're not so good that being
yourself is a good idea you know what if
You' done that when you were 12 would
you still be acting like a 12-year-old
if you just thought that's how you were
naturally no don't act like yourself act
like something useful act like something
better than you maybe you'll become that
person how about Follow Your Passion we
don't have to talk about that but we
used to hear about that and now that's
obviously
 how about this big question
about the Saudis not going to I don't
know trade in US Dollars and then our P
dollar domination will go away and the
country will collapse and I thought to
myself I don't think anybody even knows
what's going to happen and as of today
that's my current view looking at some
expert opinions well it's probably not a
big
deal so how many of you thought it was
the end of the world and today you read
the news and the experts like you know
actually probably not that big a deal
how long have be we been worrying about
this being the collapse of the United
States and then when it happens people
go you know that's not the most
important
thing so my current view is that there
will just be adjustments and everything
will work
out well you'd be surprised to find out
that the Department of Justice who
reports to Garland doesn't want to
prosecute their boss for contempt huh
Bannon got prosecuted for contempt to
Congress Peter Navaro is still in jail
for contempt to Congress but when
Garland is in condem to Congress uh no
they're not going to prosecute it now
the Republicans did a good job of
forcing the Hypocrites to oun themselves
so now we don't have to
wonder we don't have to
wonder uh if there's two forms of
Justice one for republicans and one for
Democrats there it is
so your questions have been answered
there is a separate form of punishment
for de for
Republicans well you heard a story that
the House of Representatives passed some
measure that would automatically
register young men for the draft now the
clarification is this it was already the
law that young men had to register for
the
draft um so this change is just doing it
automatically
is that bad news or good
news well I'm pretty sure if a draft
became necessary whether or not you
registered would be less important than
whether that not they had a way to find
you and they could always find you
so some number of people will not
register for the draft because they
didn't know they were supposed to just
won't do it they just didn't know it was
important should they be in jail
apparently is jailable did you know that
it's a felony to not register for the
draft how many of you didn't know that
so it could be a quarter of a million
dollar fines could be felony but it's
it's even more than that eventually when
you age out of it and the statute of
limitations wears off at that point you
can't be jailed and you can't be fined
but apparently you are forever banned
from uh working for the government
or getting government financial help in
a lot of things and a lot of states have
their own laws to punish you for not
signing
up so if you make it
automatic it's actually
safer for the young men because then
nobody's going to say hey you didn't
sign up so now you have to go to jail
they'll say oh everybody signed up it's
automatic isn't that
better so what you might have thought is
oh my God instituting the
draft is really just they took away a
potential penalty for young men who for
no fault of their own maybe didn't
register so it probably is just a net
plus and nothing
else that's my
guess however is the timing
suspicious recruitment is way
down we know that recruitments in the
toilet and it's hard to get qualified
people to volunteer
and the Ukrainian war is heating up and
uh people are talking about boots on the
ground of at least
Europeans that's not much of a leap to
think that maybe the United States is
just sort of getting
ready yeah just in case which isn't a
bad idea for a country because it sends
a signal to the other countries that we
serious but here's the
kicker why is it that only men would be
drafted
we have a democrat in power should they
not be honest with their people so I
think the Democrats have to do one of
two things either say we were lying all
the time about uh you know the genders
being basically equal to do everything
so really we were when it really matters
we were just kidding you're not equal
the men will do the fighting you ladies
stay home they can't say that by the way
that's not my opinion I'm just saying
that what are they going to do so they
built a they built a party that is
proman woman can do
everything they need to be registered
for the draft
fully so I don't think men should be
registered for the draft unless women
are so long as we're living in a women
in a world in
which everybody's the
same so I think women should worry about
combat uh and worry about getting draft
drafted so I think the odds of women
being drafted into the military under a
Biden regime are
nonzero I'd give it an odds of U maybe
size as
20% that if Biden wins
re-election the the women will actually
be drafted and that will be prepping for
a European
War now I would bet against it you know
I would bet with the 80% likelihood it
wouldn't happen but if I a female voter
and I knew there was really no chance
that would happen under Trump but a 20%
chance I would get drafted into the army
and sent to
Ukraine and I think that women need to
be a little bit more informed that
they're very
close to being handed a gun and sent to
Ukraine they're very close I don't think
they know
that so it' be nice if there were at
least a warant that the possibility is
there
uh
MSNBC The propaganda
network is so funny like you know I
always say I'm watching it for for fun
and I always think oh you think that's
hyperbole no I actually watch it for the
laughs because they're so bad crazy
but really it's just propaganda so
they're they're just
acting but here's what they're trying to
sell
us uh they're trying to sell us that the
bus their uh Business Leaders who of
course don't give their names Anonymous
sources msnbc's got some Anonymous
sources those are always reliable aren't
they uh and they said that they
questioned Trump's mental Fitness
because he couldn't keep a thought
straight and he would go in One
Direction and then go in another
Direction uh behind closed doors so
here's what MSNBC is trying to sell
their public and I'm not making this up
this is actually what they're trying to
sell to Their
audience that Biden is
uh looks dead in public but if you were
to catch him privately
perfect Trump is in public all the time
doing these highlevel hard things like
rallies and you talking for an hour
extemporaneously uh and while he does
look great in public behind closed doors
he's actually
so if you're an embassy
MSNBC if you're an MSNBC audience
they're literally trying to teach you
that Biden is a in public but
behind closed doors just fine and that
Trump every day you see him he looks
just fine but behind closed doors let me
tell you he all falls apart behind those
closed doors according to Anonymous
people who don't like
him and there even been saying that it's
full projection and that the uh the
right right leading media is becoming
like North
Korea how can you watch Morning Joe and
not thinking that's the the North Korea
the projection is in is in full full
form well to counter that uh chamoth
Pala um one of the wealthy investor VC
types who was at the David Sachs event
and uh where Trump was there raising
money in San Francisco and he was
talking recently on his podcast about
the experience of meeting Trump
personally and what he came away with is
he's definitely sharp in public in
private uh he's pro- AI doesn't want to
overregulation and low taxes basically
all the things the business people want
to hear he understands them all that the
Tariff versus income tax is a pretty
complicated thing which he apparently
understands and is promoting at least
floating as a
possibility and uh the other thing that
Cham Cham said is that uh he's super
funny and personable and charismatic he
just and you know he said that his
experience of him in person was so
different from his sort of bombastic
public Persona that nobody would even
imagine it that was exactly my
experience I in person he's humble and
polite and funny and
charismatic like you could not like him
more in person like he really has the
whole package of you know how to how to
work a crowd how to work an individual
so chouth came Under This Spell and he
even said that that Trump was making him
laugh so apparently he was looking at
jamath and his wife who was very
attractive
and uh he said 'wow you're you know a
beautiful couple my goodness you're a
beautiful couple and then then he turns
to chamoth within hearing range of his
beautiful wife he goes man you must be
really
rich now that's
funny it's funny that he said it in
front of the guy's
wife and even Jaba thought it was
hilarious said his wife thought it was
hilarious and they'll probably talk
about it for the rest of their life now
that's Trump right
that that is exactly who he is in
private he's hilarious and he's very fun
to talk to all right uh other stories
everything's going Trump's way a bunch
of CEO according to the Wall Street
Journal the top CEOs are flocking to
Trump well I don't know if they're
flocking but appear apparently Trump has
won over the major Bank CEOs you know
the jam diamond type doesn't mean
they're necessarily voting for him but
they do seem to think there's a trump
advantage to banking in business so if
you get the bankers you have the money
people but he also has the most
important Venture capitalists in Silicon
Valley and by the way pretty much all of
them or all the ones who talk in public
I haven't heard any venture capitalist
lately being pro Biden except one who
look bad
crazy so the the reasonable ones that
you know to be smart are pretty much all
Trump at this point Bill Amman same
thing and for all the right reasons you
know AI crypto regulation taxes it's
exactly what you think so they're all
coming home meanwhile even according to
Rasmus and even Arizona looks like it's
going to go to Trump when he narrowly
lost it last time if you add in the uh
other candidates like RFK Jr and Jill
Stein whatever uh Trump has 41 to
Biden's 30
seven and uh he's doing even better than
Carrie lake is in her Senate race that's
closer uh where she's just a little bit
behind um her Challenger Ruben Galo so
it's uh what is it 44 compared to 41 so
that that's a closable gap we'll see if
she
does uh because they're 10%
undecided do you think the undecideds
are really undecided if they
vote I feel like I feel like undecided
is where you hide a prot trump vote
because if you're Pro Biden it's just
safer to say it isn't it or it used to
be it's less safe now but I think the
10% are likely to lean Pro Cary lake so
she might have a little uh a little good
luck if if this these numbers hold up
we'll see all right so here's the Trump
update let's compare the Trump update to
the Biden update all right Trump is
ahead in all the
polls again so that's great he's got the
support of the most important people in
business in the United States from Elon
Musk through the bankers to the Venture
capitalists they aren't just the
business people in those entities those
are the best business people the
smartest ones in all of those Industries
it's kind of obvious now he has um to
the shagrin of Democrats he has um
basically pulled the Republican party
together I guess even Mitt Romney was in
was in the group of people who met with
Trump when he visited Capitol Hill so
even people who were very very
anti-trump before have softened up and
uh and coming around people who said bad
things about him right after January 6
have decided Well maybe I took that too
far you know and you've seen that JD
Vance F there there are people who went
hard at him and then later in the
fullness of time and information when
you know that wasn't exactly what it
looked like was
it um so the other thing is that Trump
is getting the support of men the UFC uh
I saw Tim P
mention that Trump is getting the male
vote the Republicans I saw Greg geld
mentioned it um I've seen it in other
Publications it's now super super
obvious that the Democrats are the party
of women the um Republicans are the
party of men not that there aren't you
know men in the other and women in the
other blah blah blah it's it's just a
trend not a
universal and Trump still is ahead on
all major policy
issues I think if you took the top three
they're all Trump you know immigration e
Ukraine it's all
Trump so that's Trump so Trump basically
won everything and the only bad thing
was somebody made up a new hoax that he
insulted
Wisconsin an anonymous an anonymous
person said they were in the meeting and
he insulted
Wisconsin and then we was asked about it
he just brushed it as side goes no
there's high crime there you that's what
I was saying now
so that's it so he was basically one
little hoax that nobody cared about and
all else went his way
gigantically huge amount of money
raising a huge uh change in opinion
about what people thought of all the
lawfare everything's going his way
everything let's see how Biden's
doing Biden is seeking young influencers
for his campaign which apparently is
hurt by the fact that when you're trying
to get Tik Tock influencers to back your
campaign it doesn't work as well when
you've just signed a bill to ban Tik Tok
that's right so where where Trump is
brilliantly working the podcasts and
raising gigantic amounts of money even
from jail Biden decided to use Tik Tock
influencers and then ban Tik
Tok in other news he's continuing his
world uh us embarrassment Tour by
wandering around like an animated statue
in front of the other world leaders just
in case you'd forgotten the
contrast so it's not bad enough that we
show him wandering around like a
dementia patient in the United States no
we had to put him on the stage where all
the other world leaders appear to be
functional even if you don't like their
policies they appear to be able to walk
and talk and you see them up there and
you say hey why is it we have the only
leader in the G7 who can't walk in
talk so that's not ideal for the Biden
team and
uh the biggest question about Trump is
whether the bad guys using lawfare will
jail him before the election but all
smart people think he would he would win
even from jail whereas Biden's biggest
question is will he survive until
election day or will he crumple into a
pile of dust and the wind will blow it
away before November 5th so over all I
would say that Trump's looking a little
bit better winning all the polls getting
all the business support winning Men by
a huge margin he favored on all the
policies but Biden is looking for Tik
Tok influencers while Banning Tik Tok
 idiot embarrassing the world the
us around the world uh on camera so we
can all watch it and the biggest
question is whether he's even healthy
enough to survive until election
day so what if he wins
I I saw Greg geld ask this question what
if he
wins there's going to be some trouble I
don't recommend trouble yeah don't do
anything but how how is the public going
to accept that it's just going to look
like it's rigged
so there you
go
um so it's all good for
me CU I'm a I'm one of of those hot
rodent
men okay and the last thing is that
uh the Secretary of State
blinkin um he said that the Kremlin is
intensifying its hybrid attacks against
NATO members now do you know what the
hybrid attacks are that would be like
hacking and um you murdering people in
suspicious ways that's right
so do you believe the do you believe
when Tony blinkin says Russia's doing
hacking and
hurting hurting the countries that are
near uh Russia over there how do they
know it's Russian
hackers if I've taught you anything it's
this if somebody claims that Russian
hackers broke into anything that's
probably
 I'm not saying that Russian
hackers never have broken into anything
I'm just saying they'll never be able to
prove it and it's always very convenient
when it happens isn't it oh we're mad at
Russia because of Ukraine and uh there's
all these suspicious hacks well that
must be
Russia no it might be but I would put
zero credibility on any claim of Russia
hacking how about Russia hacking
Hillary's emails nope I do not believe
that that really happened in the real
world that looks like to me
maybe I wouldn't say it's
impossible but I think every claim of
Russia hacking is in the really low
credibility range no matter where it
comes from even if the government says
oh we've got tons of evidence can't show
it to you but we got all the evidence no
don't believe it because R Russia is
just the scapegoat of
scapegoats so if somebody says hey we
found a bunch of dead bodies we think
it's Russia uh maybe probably
not the the
anti-semitic people on
YouTube are are just so uh
animated every day I have to deal with
people telling me I don't understand
history and if I did I would see the
mass Jewish conspiracy
and I always
ask I'm willing to listen to the
argument so what do you got and it's
always nothing so if when I say okay
well if you're making a claim what would
be the evidence for that well Scott if
you knew history I go well okay why
don't you point me to something well if
you're not going to be educated no just
show me something and it just disappears
as soon as you ask for any anything
reliable or anything
so um we're still talking about VP
possibilities
yeah um TV heads car defending
the Biden wandering around was not shown
on mainstream
TV yeah the people still watching
mainstream TV are just lost I'd love to
see Trump say that I L Trump to say you
know you should lose
all all credibility in the mainstream
press and you you should look at at
least the
podcasters who are sort of the alternate
news at this
point yeah so is it the WF that's
controlling the world or is the
Freemasons or is the the gigantic Jewish
conspiracy that you're all sure is
happening but nobody has any information
that they can share with me that would
be not
stupid a lot of
conspiracies well I don't know some of
them might be true but that ladies and
gentlemen concludes my Saturday amazing
coffee with Scott Adams I'm going to say
goodbye to YouTube and Rumble and x and
talk to my beloved subscribers on
locals uh um if you're not subscribing
to the Dilbert comic that's either on X
by subscription or on
locals you ad miss that dilbur is using
the declining birth rate argument to try
to get his date to sleep with
them because they're going to need to
increase the population of the Earth or
we're all dead it doesn't work out well
for Dilbert as you might guess and if
you have not yet bought my book God's
debris the complete works that includes
the first two books plus a new a new
short story to complete the Avatar
Arc you should because people are loving
it the reviews are crazy it's a good
gift book by the way and a great summer
book and or reframe your brain is is H
