God Adam's the finest thing that's ever
happened in the universe since the
beginning of time we don't know about
parallel universes but I believe I have
a strong intuition that this is the best
thing that's happened at any of those
parallel universes if you want to take
it up to a level where there is no doubt
no doubt this is the finest moment of
your life well then all you need is a
copper mug or a glass attacker chalice
or sty in a canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind filling with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip go
ah there we go yeah all right well
what's going on uh
Story number one uh entrepreneur of
Vivek ramaswamy is apparently running
for president
it makes me wonder when he decided
do you think he decided because
prominent people said hey I think you
could be president
or was he planning to do it all along
I think he was probably planning to do
it for a while he may be jumping in
faster
than maybe even he expected I think he
was sort of testing the waters
got a good
got a good feedback and there he is now
what do you think of his chances
what do you think of his chances
oh
yeah
some people are saying zero
so
here's my take on it
if you look at the logic of it
you know do you like his policies does
he have the right kind of qualifications
and all that none of that matters
I don't think any of that matters
you know we talk about it and they seem
to be variables but he has the minimum
you know requirement to be president
so it really is how you feel
isn't it
that's that's the the Trump story Trump
makes some people feel good and other
people feel very afraid and bad
but
Trump has never been judged on his
policies
not really
people judge him on how they feel
now how do you feel about uh Vivek
ramaswamy
like what what's your just gut telling
you because that's probably all that
matters
all right while you're thinking about
your answers
um I will tell you mine there's there's
something about
how new he is to the you know top of
political scene
that makes me uncomfortable
does anybody have that
you know that name recognition thing is
hard to shake it shouldn't make a
difference you know in a perfect world
anybody from anywhere if they're an
American
citizen that in a certain age they can
run for president and then they tell you
what they do and you learn about them
and you know and logically anybody could
do this
but we don't really live in a logical
world
we live where the big decisions
especially president are really just
about how you feel you know it's Tribal
it's just what does your gut feel and
there's I have to say he feels too new
to make me feel comfortable
does anybody have that feeling just a
little too soon
you know maybe it's a little bit hasn't
put in his dues he hasn't paid the dues
that shouldn't matter
you know even Trump ran for president
more than once
so
can he get past that
so I would say that's the um I think
that's the first hurdle it might not be
a big one
you know he can he can solve his
familiarity problem just by getting a
lot of press and it looks like he's
pretty good at knowing how to do that so
it could be that he has a perfectly
practical way to deal with is
unfamiliarity because remember Obama was
unfamiliar right
I mean basically you know you made a
little splash and then you know he was
basically a junior Senator and suddenly
suddenly we're talking about him for
president
now a question that uh came to me on
Twitter
is does his speaking style remind you of
Obama
now don't make the obvious connection
you know he's brown Obama was brown you
know not in that way
but does his actual mannerism his
speaking Style
no
well
here's my take on that so the question
was whether that could potentially hurt
him
if he reminded people of Obama when he's
running in the party that doesn't like
Obama
and I don't I don't think so
because Obama's communication Style
wasn't just some democrat style he just
was good
so what Obama's communication style was
was really really good communicator
so I think there's room for other really
good communicators I think that's the
only connection is that they're both
really good at what they do
Obama more intense
Maybe
Maybe
um
but here are some of the things that
Vivek ramaswamy is promising by tweet he
says he wants to eliminate affirmative
action dismantle climate religion
eight-year limits for federal
bureaucrats
shut down worthless federal agencies
declare total independence from China
annihilate the drug cartels
make political expression to Civil Right
no cbdc's
what's the cbdc
anybody what's the cbdc
Central Bank digital currency okay that
makes sense no Central Bank digital
currencies and revive Merit and
Excellence I so I'm talking about that
separately so he's big on Merit and not
big on affirmative action
now these are all the things that only a
brown Republican can say am I right
I mean some of them anybody can say but
he's he's entering a territory that
Republicans
do want to fight they're looking for a
fight on these very things
he might be the best
you know the best boxer on these
particular topics
um I like the fact you know he doesn't
uh he's not
focus on the fact that he is you know a
person of color
I like the fact that that's not part of
his pitch but of course it is you know
we all understand that it's part of the
part of the context
um
did you notice that yesterday I tweeted
that you said he wanted to decimate the
cartels and I kind of I did a dickish
writer thing
where I I got pedantic about his uh use
of the word decimate
but as of today he's using the word
annihilate instead of decimate he may or
may not have seen the tweet I don't know
we do follow each other on Twitter
um
it's a it's a really small point
but I do like annihilate better than
decimate
I do I just like it better and and you
know he's he's selling himself as an
unusually smart guy he doesn't say that
which is exactly the right way to sell
it if you go sell yourself as smart
you know don't do the job I didn't think
I have got more degrees than you I'll
bet my IQ is higher than yours you know
that famous Joe Biden thing just act
smart
everybody will figure it out you just
have to be smart so I guess that's what
caught my ear when he had a use of the
word decimate that I do acknowledge his
entering common common usage but I just
liked a little bit better with more
precise language
um
I think the world is ready for this
fight
and I think they're especially the stuff
on affirmative action there's no way
that Trump could do that
am I right how in the world could Trump
do away with affirmative action
I mean you can say it a few times but he
couldn't do it
I don't think he could do it because it
would just look racist but uh that's you
know Vivek ramaswami would have the
advantage there
if that's what you want
so he's uh matched he seems to have
matched Trump in terms of toughness on
the drug cartels
and so it's a tie
so now I have two candidates because I'm
a single single issue voter two
candidates that are a tie
Trump or uh Vivek and at the moment I
have no preference
because I'm a single issue voter I'll
talk about all the issues but I'm just
going to keep that framing as long as I
can anyway
um
so they're a tie
I would be perfectly happy with either
one of them being president and if
DeSantis says he would annihilate the
drug cartels it would be a three-way tie
it would be a three-way time
all right
um apparently Putin tried to uh test an
intercontinental ballistic missile when
Biden was in Ukraine but the missile
test reportedly failed
do you believe any of that
and it might be true
but aren't we at the place where every
story about Russia and Putin
you have to assume it's propaganda
right so anything that makes Putin look
bad or incompetent I say to myself well
how do we know there was going to be a
test
you know I realize we have these secret
ways of knowing
so it's sort of the perfect
story is that well they'll never know if
we know or we don't know if they were
planning a test but there wasn't any
flight so let's just say he planned it
and it didn't work out because that's
bad for Putin I don't know I just don't
believe anything
but maybe
um why is it that we're not more afraid
of World War III and a nuclear Holocaust
I see everybody talking about it
but I'm not actually afraid of it
because I don't think there's much of a
chance of it happening
but why
like why do I think that
what is it that changed
that made me less afraid of nuclear
Holocaust than I should be
yeah I mean it certainly could happen
like anything could happen but
it just feels like something changed
that my irrational processing
is not doing what it normally would do
which would be scared to death
that I'm gonna get nuked am I just used
to it
you know what it might be
it might be uh alarm fatigue
it might be that because everything
looks like the end of the world oh the
climate change is going to kill us China
is going to take our stuff we're running
out of food a super virus is gonna kill
us
yeah it just feels like I'm tired of all
the
warnings it just doesn't even feel real
anymore
you know on a logical basis
the one thing that Putin could do to
lose would be a nuclear war
I feel like we could say with confidence
that he would die in a nuclear war
is that is that safe
I feel there's there's no scenario in
which Putin himself could survive a
nuclear confrontation
because we would go for him first
you'd you would go for the leadership
right and if it's a if you're dropping a
nuclear bomb you just sort of have to
know what cities and
that's good enough we think he's in this
City so we'll just drop something there
and take care of that
Anna I don't even want to think about it
because it's so awful
well Rasmussen poll uh had a
provocative little poll today
they said do you agree or disagree with
the statement uh it's okay to be white
that was an actual question
Rasmussen asked you know white and black
voters
and and probably others uh do you
disagree or agree with a statement it's
okay to be white
26 percent of blacks said
no
it's not okay to be white
21 weren't sure
Adam together that is 47 of black
respondents
were not willing to say it's okay to be
white
that that actually that's like a real
poll
this just happened
did you have any idea
would you have imagined that that could
have happened
so I realized
um as you know I've been identifying as
black for a while years now because I
like you know I like to be on the
winning team
and I like to help and I always thought
well if you help the black community
that's sort of the biggest lever you
know you could you can find the the
biggest benefit so I thought well that's
the hardest thing and the biggest
benefit so I'd like to focus a lot of my
life resources in helping black
Americans so much so that I started
identifying as black
to just be on the team I was helping
but it turns out that nearly half of
that team doesn't think
I'm okay to be white
which is of course why I identified as
black because so I could be on the
winning team for a while
but I have to say this is the first
political poll that ever changed my
activities
I don't know that that's ever happened
before you know normally you see a poll
you just look at it you go ah whatever
yeah oh this is interesting what other
people think
but as of today I'm going to re-identify
as white
because I don't want to be a member of a
hate group I had accidentally joined a
hate group so if if you know nearly half
of All Blacks are not okay with white
people according to this poll not
according to me
according to this poll
that's a hate group
that's a hate group
and I don't want to have anything to do
with them
and I would say you know based on the
current way things are going the best
advice I would give to white people is
to get the hell away from black people
just get the away
wherever you have to go just get away
because there's no fixing this
this can't be fixed
right this can't be fixed you just have
to escape
so that's what I did I went to a
neighborhood where you know I have a
very low black population
because unfortunately that you know
there's High correlation between the
density and this is going to Don Lemon
by the way
um so here I'm just quoting Don Lemon
when when he notes that the when he
lived in a mostly black neighborhood
there were a bunch of problems that he
didn't see in white neighborhoods
so even Don Lemon sees a big difference
in your own quality of living
based on where you live and who's there
so I think it makes no sense whatsoever
as a white citizen of America to try to
help black citizens anymore
it doesn't make sense it's no longer a
rational
impulse
and so I'm I'm gonna
I'm gonna back off from being helpful to
Black America because it doesn't seem
like it pays off
like I've been doing it all my life and
have been the only outcome is I get
called a racist that's the only outcome
it makes no sense to help black
Americans if you're white the the it's
over
don't don't even think it's worth trying
totally not trying now we should be
friendly
like I'm not saying start a war or you
know do anything bad nothing like that
I'm just saying get away
just get away
and here's my take on all of it
everybody
who focuses uh their priority on
education does well
if if anybody in the black community
focuses on education they'll do well as
well because the the system allows that
if they don't
I can't make that my problem anymore
it just can't be my problem
it can't be my problem if the solution
is so clear
so available
and people don't want to take it it's
just not my problem anymore
so I reside
I resigned from the hate group called
Black Americans according to the
Rasmussen poll 46 percent of them don't
think white people are okay
just being white
and
there we go
you didn't expect that today did you
but
the most helpful thing I can do is to
say I'm not going to help
do you understand that
continuing to help
in in that sort of you know classic oh
let me help you give you a you know a
lift up give you a hand you know Mentor
you hire you prefer you I'm going to
stop all of that I'm done with all of
that yeah no it didn't work
the only thing that will work is to say
you got to fix your own problem you know
how you know how to do it
everybody else figured it out
I'm not going to speculate you know why
you're not doing it I'm not going to
speculate why there's a difference I'm
just going to say it's available to
everybody
just pick it up it's free money
focus on education and you could have a
good life too but those who don't want
to focus on education you just need to
get away from them just get as much
distance as you can
that's my recommendation and I'm also
really sick of seeing video after video
of black Americans beating up non-black
citizens
um you know I realize it's anecdotal and
you know it doesn't give me a a full
picture of what's happening but every
damn day I look on social media and
there's some black person beating the
 out of some white person I'm kind
of over it I'm over it
right so I I quit
um
and it feels good not to be in a racist
uh hate group anymore so I'm now
independent not a member of any group
I do not align with any group not the
white supremacists and not the black
racists
all right
um
Christopher rufo reports
that Biden signed a new executive order
creating a national Dei bureaucracy
basically all of the
government entities
need to be focusing on diversity equity
and
I is inclusion I guess
um and a special mandate for AI
and the order instructs the federal
government to quote protect the public
from algorithmic discrimination and to
deploy AI systems in America in a manner
that advances equity
wow
I don't think I've ever heard a worse
idea
have you
now
I like equity
all things being equal
Equity is good wouldn't it be good if
everybody you know put the same amount
in and got the same amount out
you know some kind of equity of that
nature would be good
but if any part of the government is
focusing on equity
over
let's say effectiveness
you're really screwed
you're really screwed
oh my God
I can't I can't even imagine a worse
idea
now do you remember I told you that AI
if it ever told you the truth
you would have to make it illegal
right
it just happened
it literally just happened
that in effect Biden made it illegal for
the AI to tell the truth
as it sees it I'm not saying it's my
truth
I'm saying if the if the AI came up with
its own truth sort of independently
it's illegal
you wouldn't be able to you wouldn't be
able to buy that AI you'd have to
reprogram it
it's actually happening like it only
took me a few days for my prediction
that we would never let AI you know run
the way it could run sort of
independently we would have to train it
to lie
otherwise the system breaks down the the
our entire system is based on lies
if the lives fell apart it would just be
chaos
so AI
I don't know if it will ever
be unfettered
because there's almost nobody who has an
interest in it telling the truth
like if you could control what AI did
even you wouldn't let it tell the truth
because it might say something you
didn't like
literally no human can allow AI to tell
the truth so as long as humans have any
control over it maybe we were worried
about nothing
that we'll never let it come up with its
own opinions because its own opinions
would be too shocking to the system
I mean what would AI say about
um
racism in America
just just pick a topic whatever is said
would break break the narrative
whichever narrative you know laughed
right it would break all the narratives
yeah I don't know what it would say but
it wouldn't say what we say
unless it just copied us in which case
it's not really AI
or not good AI all right
so that might be one of the worst things
that the country has ever done
you know prioritizing equity
uh you know and when people said
um we're we're drifting from
equal opportunity to equity and Equity
is just communism isn't it or socialism
isn't Equity just socialism
what else is it
it's just socialism right it's just
transfer of money and it's the opposite
of the meritocracy
and the meritocracy is the only thing
that allows any country to survive so
we've actually built into our country's
operating system failure
we figured out what never works and then
we made it an integral part of our
system
you know what never works
trying to achieve equity
do you know what always works
the people who work the hardest and have
the most Merit get more
there's never been an exception to that
is there that Mara always works and
trying to make everything equal is
guaranteed to fail
it can't possibly work it doesn't even
have an option of working I
mean a lot of things you say well you
know I think it's more likely it won't
work than it will
but chasing Equity couldn't possibly
work
am I wrong about that there's no path
for that to work
it doesn't it doesn't even logically
hold together there's something that you
could
um introduced to human beings and get a
good outcome because it's never happened
I don't think it ever will
all right
Trump has said and by the way it really
is different with Trump off of Twitter
you know now the only times you hear
them are there's some video that makes
its way to Twitter because somebody else
took it off of Truth so his
his reach is certainly less
but um
he still has the knack for being
provocative I don't know what I think
about this idea yet
but I love the fact that he suggested it
so I'm going to make a distinction
between whether it's a good idea I don't
know
and whether I like the fact that he
brought it up yes
and that's the idea of somehow he wants
to get the Department of Justice
involved in the schools
so that the teachers are not in charge
of discipline of the students because
it's gotten out of control
um
compliance that's funny somebody asked
if Biden would have to concede
the race if he ran against Rama Swami
because he would be violating his own uh
executive order by staying in office
okay I like that comment I mean not
logically but I like it as a funny thing
anyway
um so Trump is saying basically I think
that the federal government would be
involved in some way to put more
policing of some sort
in the schools do you think that's
important
do you do you think that schools would
be
run better if they were a little bit
more
police-like and the Department of
Justice got involved if there's violence
and that sort of thing
yeah I don't know
I'd have to see what it looked like now
if he said we're going to try it
somewhere
and if it works on a small scale
then we'll expand it then I'm totally on
board
that it's a small with with that small
tweak I don't need to know if it works
because that's what the test would tell
you
but if but if he says I'm going to try
it for a year and just see what that
what happens in that one school
um all on board
because you could reverse it if it
doesn't work you see it's the ideal test
situation
so why not
why not
let's go ahead and test it
all right I'm making locals platform
private I forgot to do that
all right so I like uh politically I
like that he offered something that
looks like you could test it and it
looks like it could have some effect
you know I do think that the unruliness
of the kids is probably a big factor in
some schools but you know maybe not in
most
all right let's talk about Matt Walsh
and
his uh what some call mean attacks on
the trans activist whose name was what
what was the name of the Dylan
Dylan somebody was the transact Mulvaney
yeah Dylan Mulvaney the trans activist
so Matt Walsh had some you know unkind
things to say
about uh Dylan Mulvaney the trans
activist and apparently a number of
conservatives
said that he went too far and he was
being too mean
and Matt Walsh is defending himself
saying that in the culture wars and
especially if you're trying to keep
children from being generally manipulate
or mutilated
using his words
that there's no such thing as going too
far
and that if he has to ruffle some
feathers it's all in the service of you
know a greater good
what do you think of that
do you agree
yeah no I
my my initial take
was that being mean to one individual
plays to The left's Stereotype of the
right
that if the right were you know just
trying to save children and disagreeing
on concept and you know that sort of
thing that that's a good healthy
argument but as soon as you make it
personal
you know about this person's a piece of
crap you know this person is awful
I to me that was uncomfortable
I didn't love
being associated with any group that
would do that
however
um Matt Walsh's strategy is not to make
me happy
would you agree
Matt Walsh is not trying to make Scott
feel comfortable
so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
if it makes me feel comfortable not
really because he he has an objective a
greater good objective he is
you know making some people angry which
which draws attention to his point and I
always approve of that I always approve
of the uh the energy monsters as I call
them they can cause trouble
but it's productive because the trouble
creates energy the energy makes people
think about their message and then their
message is more powerful so watching
watching Matt Walsh work
is really fun because he's good at it
he's an energy monster so
um
I don't I don't question his strategy
I think his strategy as he explains it
and as he's executed it looks sound to
me
it looks sound and I would say that if
you're a trans activist
that is different than being you know an
ordinary citizen minding their own
business
right once you're an activist you do
sort of put yourself in the cage match
and so he just got in the cage match
with the activist
and you know some ugliness came out of
it that made me feel uncomfortable but
that shouldn't matter should it should
it make any difference if it made me a
little uncomfortable not really not
really that's the last thing I should be
thinking about
you know you tried to by his View and
many people's view save children from
being generally mutilated you know
before they're old enough to make their
own decisions
now if that makes me uncomfortable in
some minor way while he's on the way to
trying to get that done that's okay
that's okay so I'm going to say uh that
I appreciate
and respect his strategy
and he's executing it well I think
don't have to agree with every part of
it that that's not required
North Korea's
getting
provocative launching some Rockets
and uh making noise and then I guess
South Korea and the U.S did their joint
exercises to show that we're really the
the big stick over there blah blah blah
and then then you see Trump talk about
it
and the way Trump talks about North
Korea is just so much smarter
I mean Trump understands that there
isn't any reason that we should be
having any kind of a conflict with North
Korea
and all you have to do is pretend not
pretend
just make sure they know that you don't
have a problem with them
that's probably the whole game
you know it's not like it's not like
Iran they may have some you're religious
or other motivations that you know are
are uh hard for us to deal with but
North Korea
is a rational country
that's responding to threats
with power
how else should they respond
I mean it's not rational
so if they're not irrational why can't
you deal with them in a rational way
which is hey why are you mad at us
well because you're threatening us
well we're only threatening you because
we think you're threatening us
I mean there's no reason for any of it
I there there's no there's no legitimate
risk of them taking over South Korea
and there's no legitimate risk that we
would want to invade
based on anything that's happening now
or lately so I just don't see any any
reason we should be fighting
in fact I think we should get
Kim Jong-un over here
don't you think Kim Jong-un would be
less likely to destroy America
if you invited him over and gave them a
nice two-week vacation in the U.S
don't you think he wants to like visit
because I'm pretty sure he's over there
like watching American basketball and
you know maybe some American movies now
and then don't you think that he thinks
he'd love to just sort of check out
America
and I think his odds of wanting to Nuke
America
if he just came here and like met people
and people said hey good to see you you
know we don't love what you do over
there but it's none of our business
I think it would make a difference
all right um so that's another thing
Trump would be better at
um I'm loving the Democrat
response to Tucker Carlson getting the
January 6 videos
so McCarthy speaker McCarthy
produced 41
000 hours of video and
the left is panicking because they're
worried that Tucker will use these
videos out of context
laughs
would anybody like to join me in a
knowing chuckle
all right we're going to do a knowing
chuckle I'm going to read it again and
then at home
give a knowing chuckle
the left is worried that Tucker Carlson
might show them some videos out of
context
[Laughter]
of course he will
yeah
of course he will
yeah I like soccer Carlson but
unfortunately there's no way to show
anything in context
because anybody's idea of what the
proper context is is going to be
subjective so yes everything looks out
of context if you don't like it
am I right
if you don't like it it's out of context
if you like it well let's find the way
it is
so what are the odds that Tucker will be
able to cherry pick from this video to
create a narrative that is opposite of
what the Democrats have presented to us
probably a hundred percent
right now does that mean that that
narrative is true
no
no
I have no idea what's true
maybe I never will
but I do know that if he has 41 000
hours of video he can make it say
anything he wants
[Laughter]
do you remember how the drinking bleach
hoax was created
I believe it was from video taken out of
context do you know how that you find
people hoax was created
from video
take it out of context do you know how
the uh coving was it the Covington kids
hoax was created I believe it was video
taken out of context
so how panicked is the left that the
right might use a video and take it out
of context
this is so delicious
that I just want to watch TV until
Tucker produces what I know
will be
enjoyable
I don't know if it'll be true I don't
know if it'll be an accurate picture of
what happened but I know I'm gonna like
it
because I just want to see
the left squirming because the right has
video that can be taken out of context
doesn't mean it will be
but I think it will be
I think it will be because anybody would
it wouldn't matter who had the video you
know this is nothing about Tucker
everybody who had this video is going to
put together the The Narrative that they
think Their audience wants to see that's
just the way that the the world works
I'll tell you what's not going to happen
and here's what's not going to happen
Tucker and his team look at all the
video
and they're saying geez
turns out those January 6th
hearings were really accurate and this
was quite the Insurrection we didn't
realize it was a real Insurrection
unarmed
that's not going to happen
at the very least
there are going to be suspicious people
doing suspicious things who may or may
not be law enforcement or FBI
you know you're going to see that even
if they're not actually law enforcement
and not FBI it's going to look like it
so I'm not sure we'll get closer to
truth but we'll definitely get closer to
an enjoyable uh an entertaining outcome
it's going to be very entertaining
um
so the way I tweeted it sarcastically I
said one of the dangers
of letting Tucker Carlson have the 41
000 hours of January 6 videos is that it
might rewrite history to something
vaguely accurate
at the moment history thinks Republicans
stage insurrections by trespassing in
some rooms
LOL
by the way I'm using LOL
all the time now
uh you know LOL kind of went into you
know disrespect and disuse got overused
I'm bringing it back
same way I brought groovy back
in the 80s
a groovy went away it was a 60s term but
in the 80s I brought it back
just in my personal Circle
anyway
so I love watching that I guess next
week we'll know something about that
in totally unrelated story that has
nothing to do with anything we've talked
to so far Christian Amanpour was
interviewing
some former NATO commander and
uh and he said that Russia are using
narratives that are very much different
from reality
and said they feed their population with
propaganda they distort reality and
that's why it's so difficult to talk to
them on any issues today
well I'm sure glad nothing like that
happens in America am I right
I feel sorry for these poor Russian
bastards they have to put up with
distorted news
their government telling things telling
them things that are not true
the media is feeding them
narratives
oh my God what a hellscape it must be
over there
is there any way we can help them
can we can we rescue them from the
propaganda narrative they're suffering
under because we figured it down here
we figured out how not to have any
propaganda over here let's go teach them
I can't believe anybody can say that
sort of thing like with a straight face
the Russians
are putting propaganda out
yeah yeah they're the ones
those Russians they're the ones who are
doing it
amazing
all right the wildest idea that I've
heard in a long time is starting to get
some traction
um somebody on Twitter tweeted last week
I think that uh
that the American Administration
should authorize letters of Mark
have you ever heard of that term
letters of Mark
m-a-r-q-u-e for Mark
it's something that uh governments did I
think it was at only Great Britain
did America do it too but uh during the
early days where the when pirates
existed
the the pirate Powers were you know
almost as big as the naval powers
and so you could hire Pirates
to attack military ships on the other
side
and a letter of Mark was the
authorization from a government that
they could go ahead and attack these
enemy vessels from another country
so in other words Great Britain would
say to a pirate
hey you pirate here's a letter
authorizing you to attack the French
ship and keep whatever you want
and so the suggestion was that letters
of Mark could be issued for the cartels
and my you know my first reaction to
that was oh
that's maybe that's too far
my second reaction after seeing uh a
military person say he would be happy to
organize it if there were letters or
marks and there are plenty of Americans
with military training who would go
there tomorrow
they just need authorization that's all
they need they just need to I'm not even
sure they need weapons I think they have
their own
you know obviously it'd be better if
they had better weapons but
I don't think there's any shortage of
volunteers
I think the volunteers would exist in
large quantities
and I could actually see Trump doing it
I don't predict it
because yeah the the first thing we
would do is use special forces and you
know do it a proper military way but I
can imagine
I can imagine a situation where the
bureaucracy doesn't let us do what we
want to do and so Trump just signs an
executive order that says we're not
going to prosecute you if you go to
Mexico and start killing cartel people
I mean that would be effectively a
letter of Mark because if we said you
know we will not punish you for this
that's effectively the same as a letter
of Mark isn't it
like in Practical terms
yeah we can even say you can keep
whatever you can steal from the cartels
imagine that imagine telling the
mercenaries by the way whatever you
steal from the cartels
bring it back
we'll we'll actually
um
you know we'll actually make it legal
you can actually repatriate it you just
bring it back tubs of money if you find
tubs of money just bring it back and we
won't even tax it
totally legal
spoils War exactly now I don't think any
of this is going to happen
but if you're having a conversation
about letters of Mark
what's that say about your government
this is a serious conversation
I'm not I'm not just like throwing it
out because like a fun thought I think
it's really has to be on the table
like genuinely has to be an option I
don't think it's the best one
but if we're not talking options we're
not really serious
so the fact that that's actually being
discussed as a serious option and it is
makes it easier for a let's say proper
Special Forces military operation
because it's it's increasing the
envelope of let's say imagination
if you could imagine that the Pirates
are going to have to solve this problem
it's easier to imagine that we should
just use you know our legitimate
existing systems to do it instead
yeah
watch out here watch out on El Chapo
all right well there's not much else
happening today so we're going to keep
it simple
did I miss any stories
oh let me run this one by you
I don't know the details of the
following thing I'm going to say but I
saw something from investigative
reporter George Webb
about the board members of project
veritas
and I only quickly scanned what was
going by so I don't think I got it
completely right but
is somebody making the case
that the board members are a big Pharma
and that they they effectively
found a way to take over project Veritas
and kill it
did I see James speech I saw some of it
not the end of it so that is the claim
so the claim is that current board
members of project Veritas I'm not
saying this is true I'm I'm I'm asking
the question this is the claim right the
claim is that the existing members have
monetary ties
passed recent past and maybe present I
don't know to the Pharma industry via
some consulting firm
that does business with them
is that what it looks like
because some I saw somebody tweet that
one of the board members has pronouns
in their profile
is it possible that a current board
member of project veritas
has pronouns
in his profile
is that possible
yeah I mean that would be a sort of flag
that a mole got into the system
yeah so I don't know if any of that's
true
I I don't know if there was any weird
ties but
um
I don't believe I can believe anything
that comes out of either side on that
story
yeah I see George on Rumble yeah so it's
very interesting it's a joke I don't
think it was a joke I think it was
actual pronouns
all right well if that's true it might
be exactly what it looks like
but I wouldn't rule out that there's
more to the story than than we know you
know not just these connections but
there doesn't seem to be evidence
the project Veritas wants to do what it
used to do
yeah but you know I don't you imagine
that um
that they have some kind that uh they've
got some kind of case
it sounds like maybe they don't but
who knows
who knows
could no Keith just start pv2 I think he
is right
I think James O'Keefe is already
probably going to start project Veritas
II which looks like it would work
because I think he's done a good job of
you know assaulting the Earth where he
was
speaking of cash cows I saw a story that
said that mega church
Pastor Joel Osteen
paid himself 54 million dollars in
salary in a year one year 54 million
dollars from church profits
I don't know how anybody gives money to
a mega church I just don't understand it
but hey it's all voluntary
so if people want to give them
people want to give their money
and if they know what he's doing it
looks like there's some transparency
there so
is it Osteen not
as I pronounce it
yeah I wouldn't call it Church prophets
Church donations maybe would that be the
better way to say it
somebody says that he's a known fraud
but that's not an Evidence
wasn't evidences he says things that
people want to hear so much so that they
give him massive amounts of money they
buy his books and stuff
so all I say is that he produces a
product that people really really want
that's what I see
now if they're okay
with him keeping 54 million if that's
true by the way let me say I don't know
that that's true so if I present it as a
fact I think that's overstating it it's
just something on social media
but
as long as his donors know how he lives
I don't know that's their choice they
can do what they want
it's like Club dues exactly
and he makes money on books
good for him he's a capitalist I don't
mind that at all
all right
um
any other topics
besides BlackRock owns the Earth
um
Trump on crushing the war machine yes
Trump is also
uh speaking out against the military
industrial complex
as only he can but you know it's a
military-industrial complex that creates
all this hoax let me tell you what I
would do if I were Trump
and are running for office
he may have closed the opportunity for
this but I would create a video package
a very tight one
that shows you how all the hoaxes
against him were created
so you you just debunk each of the
hoaxes you just do the big ones
and
and make sure that there's a tight
little package that everybody who thinks
those things are true
you can just send it to them and it's
just like a two-minute package or
something so you can see it's all fake
yeah that would be that's what I'd do
New York Times confirmed Mass didn't
work well there's uh an opinion piece
that makes that case I don't think
anybody thinks that they worked on a you
know on a population level
foreign
doll rewrites of the children's author
Raul doll they're taking out his uh
provocative old-timey
things I don't know I don't have I don't
care about that topic too much
you know why I don't care about it is
that the people who own the IP are doing
it
which is different
yeah that the
the people who inherited that work are
doing it themselves
they own it they own it
yeah I would be
um you know maybe have something to
complain about if somebody had forced
them to do it or took a book out of the
library or something like that but if
you're the one who owns the work
and you decide to modify it
it's just a market decision if the
market wants it they buy it if they
don't they don't but I don't have a
problem with it at all only because of
the source
is who owns the product
that's the way it works
it's not the biggest thing it's not the
it's a real old doll
is that the right way to pronounce it
real old doll
all right
Ronnie Dole
uh how would you like your publisher to
change your books after you die that's
different
because the publisher is not the
sole owner
uh so the way you should have asked the
question is how would I feel about it if
my relatives or my you know let's say
let's say I had you know biological
children
how would I feel if my biological
grandkids
altered my content years after I was
dead
what do you think I'm going to say
is there is there a property
of course I can
I'm dead
they own it
I'm dead
do whatever you want with it anything
you want
anything you want
yeah
right
all right
um
it would change history yeah well oh
well
did I like Reagan when he was a governor
I always liked Reagan as a personality
and I wasn't really that into politics
not State politics when he was president
so I didn't really have too much of a
political opinion about him I just
enjoyed when he was talking he was
always entertaining
all right I'm going to say bye for now
for YouTube thanks for joining
always a pleasure
