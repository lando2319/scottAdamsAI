and welcome to the highlight of
civilization while it lasts
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
it's the best thing that's ever happened
to you would you like to take your
experience to levels that nobody's ever
heard of before
of course you would and all you need for
that is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker cells to style the canteen yoga
flask of a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the end of the
day the thing that makes everything
better a little bit of oxytocin today
go
I think I was supposed to say it's the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
well let's see if that sip was enough to
heal the Republic
oh not looking so good uh an update I
told you yesterday that I was hacked on
the locals platform it wasn't a hack
it's even funnier than that
what I thought happened was when I
tweeted that I was going to be on locals
there's a picture or an image from
locals that gets picked up automatically
and it turned from my image
without my knowledge and it turned into
a Dilbert with a KKK a necktie
which somebody had cleverly created to
make their point
and it turns out it wasn't a hack
that locals had actually paid somebody
in another country to update that image
and they grabbed that image from the
internet and did not know there was
anything wrong with the necktie
so it was just somebody who's not not
familiar with American culture who just
thought well that's a perfectly good
image I like how this looks so I thought
it was going to be some like amazing
hack I was so proud of the hacker I was
like oh that would be the best hack but
it wasn't
it wasn't I'm very disappointed that
somebody did not do that intentionally
it would have been one for the ages I
thought it was a good good hack but
we'll take it as a good coincidence
well you probably know the big story is
about the possibility that has been
leaked that this Elven Bragg Manhattan
D.A is going to indict an arrest
Trump on Tuesday maybe
and the news is reporting that you know
they're talking about whether it'll be
handcuffed
now I'm going to agree with Sebastian
Gorka who I just heard him on the spaces
call
say that if you think that somebody who
got a 72 million votes is going to be
handcuffed in front of the public you're
crazy
I would like to believe that's true
but this might be the only situation in
which
Trump's own lawyers would argue go ahead
and handcuff him you know you want to be
safe no we don't think it's necessary oh
I don't know he's our client and he can
be unpredictable you ought to put those
handcuffs on I don't think it's
necessary in this case well I think the
law treats everybody the same doesn't it
aren't you supposed to be representing
the president
well yes but more importantly I
represent the legal system
and I don't think people should be
treated differently just because they're
high profile
I I think maybe you should put the
handcuffs on
maybe you should
if he gets handcuffed he's your next
president
what do you think
if he gets handcuffed he's your next
president
yeah I I would I hate to say it but I'd
love to see it
I'd love to see it because there's a
theme for today's live stream
here's the theme
that's too far
have you noticed there's a whole bunch
of stuff happening in the country that
you would describe as going too far
there's a lot of stuff that started with
good ideas you know the the law should
be equally applied excellent idea
excellent good idea
people should be treated with respect
love it
and and part of that would be referring
to them in terms that are polite and
they're comfortable with I like that
that's good stuff
but do you think we've gone
too far
I love the fact that a adult human in
the United States can have surgery to
turn their body into whatever makes them
more comfortable gender wise or even
just cosmetically if they want
they're adults it's a free country-ish
go ahead but would you extend that to
Children is that too far that's too far
when you put handcuffs on or even talk
about putting handcuffs on Trump
for we'll talk about what he did doesn't
that feel a little too far
it's a little too far
right and I feel as though
there's a whole bunch of stuff that's
hitting the same category
do you think that canceling me was too
far what do you think
canceling me too far
well the right would say too far the
left would say you got what you
you left around and found out
that's the funniest insult I'm getting
people are saying well you you have to
round and you found out
to which I said you didn't hear me
complaining
why are we even talking about it is it
your complaint if it's not your
complaint it's not a conversation if I
complain
well maybe you'd have something to say
about that but no I didn't F around and
find out I made something happen
it happened a little bigger than I
thought it was going to happen but
I'm entirely comfortable with the
outcome because
I think I'm one of the canaries in the
coal mine in this situation
it's just too far
and I think it's time to throw down the
gauntlet
we would not hire these people
these people being the woke
and I don't mean woke as an attitude
which is fine I like being woke as an
attitude but once you bring that into my
life and you put your wokeness on me
you've gone too far
you've gone too far
and I think that we've reached a point
where everything is now too far because
there was no stopping it and the reason
it went too far is that white men were
afraid to say anything
that's it
that's the whole story white men
were afraid to say anything because the
penalty was too high well everybody
the penalty is too high but I said it
anyway I set it to piss off anybody I
could piss off
the reason was to piss off but the
purpose is to make a change the change
that would be good for everybody not
just good for me because there's nothing
that's going to help me right I've
sacrificed myself to the to the system
at this point so it's not about me
but
if you're okay we're with where things
are going
stay silent
if you're not just say you wouldn't hire
these people
these people not being black people no
no
I'm not talking about black people I
love black people
I don't like
the mindset that says I'm the problem
I don't like the mindset that says
children can be altered
just because they think they should be
there's something completely broken here
and the problem is that white men in
particular are just shutting the up
because you're afraid of getting fired
and afraid of getting canceled I think
everything's going too far
I think that the anti-white movement is
just so grotesque and so bad for the
country that it's time that Black
America finds out you went too far
Black America you went to far
I'm telling you because nobody else will
now am I defending my comments of course
not they were meant to inflame they were
meant to attract attention they were
meant to piss you off they were meant to
to deeply trouble you that's what I did
intentionally
I don't apologize it's too far
you've just taken it too far
all right
it's time
it's time
not because of trump
I mean the Trump thing's too far
but it's just too far
too far
yeah all right let's see how many other
things have gone too far well let's talk
about Trump a little bit more
do you even care what he was accused of
it's not really important to the story
is it
it's not
and and when you hear that some D.A
found a clever illegal way to take
something that had already been
dismissed by the feds already dismissed
as not important enough to to go after
and that he found a way to cleverly
combine things to turn it into a felony
that's too far that is too far
If This Were happening to Biden it would
be too far it's not political this is
not political
too far
too far
let me give you some other stories that
seem to be in the same vein
um you heard about this story last week
the students at Stanford law they they
had a judge command who was a
conservative judge and he was uh
protested to the point where he couldn't
speak
and then the Washington Beacon uh
published some of the names of the
protesters
and the protesters are very angry that
their public protest against a public
person included their names
well
if you're not proud of your protest
why'd you do it
you're not proud of your protest
why wouldn't you want your name
associated with it if it's such a good
 idea
if it's such a good idea put your name
on it joke's on you none of you are
going to get jobs
you're not I mean you're you're gonna
have half as much opportunity everybody
who protested this stupid stupid too far
protest too far
um
yeah your names are going to be forever
listed as people who went too far and if
somebody wants to hire an idiot like
this go ahead
you want to hire an idiot these are all
idiots these are people in the you know
who are protesting somebody who was a
legitimate member of society broke no
laws is a lawyer a lawyer and a judge
and they're not even going to let them
talk
too far
yeah you don't get a job sorry you're
unemployable everybody was at that
protest you're unemployable let's get
their names
how about uh here's some other uh
backlash so they're in California not
too far from where I live there was a
diversity equity and inclusion director
who is being forced out of the job or
getting a lot of pressure what did she
Force down
I think she was fired and she was
accused of white speaking
okay that's that's pretty bad why are
you speaking
um and she was accused of and here's the
real part she was accused of not being
gender inclusive because she didn't want
to use the terms latinx and philippinex
did you know that Philippine X was a
thing
oh I'm not done yet she's black
she's black
or she identifies as black
um
her photo is a little less clear but she
identifies as black
and
even she it's her job to police this
kind of bad behavior that She's accused
of and even she says do you know what
she says
too far
you took it too far
it's just too far
and even she couldn't handle it she was
like this is now crazy latinx and
Philippine X did you lose your job for
that she's a black woman who got accused
of white supremacy
that actually happened
it's too far that's too far it's time
for the same people to take over because
you're not saved this is mental illness
that you're pretending is some kind of a
political statement mental
illness let's say what it is the woke
people have some kind of mental illness
not all of them because the idea of
wokeness I agree with is fine but when
you take it to latinx and philippinex
and you are somebody fired for it you
have a mental illness we're
treating their mental illness like is
your your problem no they should never
be hired they should have some kind of
therapy and and I think you know the
media is responsible for instilling this
mental illness
all right
um
and she actually says this was the D I
uh person who got fired and she says and
actually many of my friends who are
trans activists and non-binary people
actually said all of this makes me feel
uncomfortable because I'm constantly
being demanded to stay my pronouns
according to her lived experience
the very people that the wokies are
trying to protect are saying can you
leave us alone a little bit
like just maybe give us a little less
attention please
too far it's just too far
how about Bill Maher last night more on
the same theme he was talking about the
ridiculous reparations plan that San
Francisco came up with and of course
like everybody else he just mocks it as
being openly stupid let's stop calling
this about race
this reparation plan is a bunch of
stupid people doing stupid this is
stupid stuff it's too far it's
ridiculous it's obvious to anybody none
of them should ever get a job anywhere
anybody associated with this
recommendation of the reparations I
wouldn't find I wouldn't hire them for
anything
right anybody who agrees with it I
wouldn't hire him for anything I don't
care what your color is don't care who
you are if this is your mindset that
that the the non-slave state of
California should even consider taking
money from anybody else and giving it to
Black Americans who have you know no
association with any recent problems
anyway
uh
it's too far it's crazy it's stupid
and you should never get a job if you're
associated with it
it's time to time for some uh backlash
even CNN today is talking about you
remember candy the author of the book
how to be an anti-racist or something
and he was the the big go-to guy during
George Floyd and he would be the one to
explain what systemic racism is and how
important it is and apparently he says
there's a uh some of his books are now
being removed from schools and libraries
because there's what he says is a some
kind of a campaign by conservative
commentators against what they're
calling systemic wokeness
it's a backlash against systemic
wokeness a phrase I would like all of
you to adopt
yeah systemic wokeness is a real thing
now systemic racism is real
not denying that that the sort of
obvious in my my opinion but yeah
systemic weakness is ruining the country
uh uh even more actively at the moment
um you said
he said the momentum was crushed his
momentum what you would call this
anti-racist momentum was crushed by a
pretty well organized force and movement
of people who were seeking to conserve
racism you
no you you're just an
let's stop talking about this as race
this kidney guy is just a big giant
 has nothing to do with his color
this is an all right the people
who are pushing back are not defending
racism you no they're defending
sanity
they're defending A system that could
work they're trying to get rid of you
 because you're ruining the whole
 thing
so there's a little pushback now that's
the story on CNN
do you think CNN would have run in kind
of an anti-candy Story I mean it was a
little bit balanced because it showed
his side as well but even the fact that
they ran the story that there's a
backlash against him you don't think
that the white people at CNN feel it too
of course they do
of course they do
because everybody does
[Applause]
all right
um just to be clear
I don't endorse any violence or anything
except maybe against the cartels
but
there is going to be a push and all it
requires is some honesty
now honesty is really dangerous it can
be more dangerous than violence in some
ways you will get canceled
but maybe it's time
maybe it's time and when I and when I
say that white men are going to be
rising up
I don't mean in a racist way
I mean in a common sense way in a way
that would be good for everybody they're
not going to try to make anything worse
for black people if anything they try to
make it better
but it's just time white men you got to
be honest and you gotta say it's too far
and you got to put your foot down you
got to say that the Kennedys are
 the walksters are none
of them should ever have a job
and they can die in the gutter well it's
too far I don't want them to die in the
gutter but if they're going to ruin my
country
which appears to be what's happening
it don't ask for a lot of sympathy
they they need maybe some mental health
um
you know resources I wouldn't mind that
by the way I wouldn't mind some Mental
Health Resources for the over woke you
know anybody who thinks of Philippine X
and latinx is a necessary addition to
our system you just need some counseling
I don't need to change about that and by
the way I'm perfectly open
to adopting to you know new and better
ways to deal with each other I like
change
is fine but not from the idiots
all right the change shouldn't come from
the idiots let's get the idiots off the
off the field has nothing to do with
black and white and as soon as you let
them tell you it's about black and white
or you know Boy versus girl or anything
else you're losing it's idiots
against people who have some rational
sense left about how to make the system
work it's not about the people we need a
system that all of us can fit into and
Thrive and they're breaking the system
the best system that's ever existed
best one that's ever existed
let me say again just I saw
Colin Kaepernick's name go by you
remember that I've been and continued to
be a huge supporter of Colin
Kaepernick's protest
because it was so offensive
because it was offensive not because I
agreed with all of his thoughts but I
thought that I thought it was you know
worthy of focusing on to see what's what
so I thought that that was all good
now the fact that you hated it is why it
was good
that's why it was good
the fact that I pissed off half of the
country with my intentional provocation
is the Colin Kaepernick play I mean he's
literally my role model
I thought yeah that worked so I'll do it
on a small scale too I didn't realize it
would become a big scale
I miscalculated that but he was
definitely my role model
so how about a little honesty you want a
little honesty for a change
yeah the whole woke movement is a
backward stupid anti-success anti-white
movement we're completely done with it I
have no patience for it whatsoever if I
see a sniff of it I'm automatically
going to put you at the bottom of the
list for hiring you're not going to be
my friend I don't want to spend time
with you now a lot of people probably
have asked me Scott what's it like being
canceled and being labeled or racist no
 different from being a trump
supporter no difference it's
exactly like being a trump supporter for
the last several years I was also
uncomfortable being around anybody black
because they had been told I'm a racist
for supporting a person who happened to
be a republican who had been branded by
the press completely
illegitimately to believe in a narrative
which was ridiculous from the
first moment on the fine people hoax the
 bleach hoax the the Russia
collusion hoax every part of
this was illegitimate lying
and I got slimed just by being a part of
it well you and everybody else
if you're gonna if you're gonna just
slime me for supporting a particular
president I thought had a a set of
skills that we needed at that time well
 all of you I don't feel comfortable
with you I don't feel comfortable with
you you did that to your own
self I didn't do that to you I'm not the
one who made you think that somebody
voting for a republican hated
you no I didn't do that I love black
people
always have
I love black people
I hate what has been done to them
I hate
that that they've been brainwashed not
that you're right you know every
statement of anybody is is always
talking about many people
No statement refers to all the people in
the group all right can we can we all be
 less idiots for a minute and act
like when somebody says black people do
they ever mean all of them do they ever
ever do they ever mean all of them when
black people say white people are racist
do they mean every one of them
no never it's only the illegitimate
 press that would tell you that
they meant that you don't be a
idiot don't be a idiot it never
means everybody it never means everybody
ever
it's too far
going too far
so yes I am uncomfortable in the
presence of anybody who's been
brainwashed to think that just having an
opinion about a Republican president
or anything in that domain makes you a
 racist
I'm done you can call me a racist all
day long I'm out of your little
prison I'm a free man
and I'm dangerous now
that's what you did
that's what you did
now I plan to keep this productive
the first productive thing I'm going to
do is be honest
I'm going to tell you how I feel I'm
going to tell you the price right you
could do anything you want it's a free
country within the law do anything you
want but the price is I'm going to have
 hate you I'm gonna hate
you if you come out with me with a
mindset that I'm your problem because
I'm white or a male
if your problem with me is that I'm
white and then I'm male I'm done
I'm not going to pretend any more that I
like you stay the away from me and
that's not about black people that's
everybody who has the attitude that I'm
the problem because of my
my color
or my gender
I don't want to be around you I don't
want to hire you don't want to work with
you don't want to be your friend
if that's cool with you and you're
getting enough benefit of pressing this
anti-white Behavior if that's working
for you keep doing it it's a free
country and you're you have free speech
keep doing it but you need to know that
white people
are done
white men in particular done
we're done
too far
too far
now here's what I'm gonna do
I'm going to try to be productive you
know that I've created a I'm trying to
create some counter programming to the
let's say the narrative that you should
look backwards for your uh for your
inspiration let's look at all the the
horrors of the past in slavery and
discrimination they were nobody
didn't advise it we should all know it
it should be part of History
totally in favor of Black History Month
but if you're going to take a losing
perspective
and everybody any any adult knows the
looking backwards is a losing play if
you're not going to use the tools of
success that everybody uses to succeed
don't make that my problem
I'm going to make sure that everybody
understands as much as I can the tools
of success you don't have to use you
know buy books or any of my anything
that I might
sell in the future
uh at the moment I don't have anything
to buy anyway I'm canceled but if I do
it's not about that it's about we have a
whole country that's been taught a
losing path the losing path is division
for no good reason
the losing path is looking backwards at
all your grievances instead of having
some positivity and looking forward
if you're going to fight with me instead
of ask me how to be successful when you
know I can help you
that's sort of on you isn't it
all right did you watch that the white
people in America canceled the most
useful voice in race relations me
right on the first useful person because
I told you what the problem is
the problem is that you've been sold
this grievance package that will destroy
your life if you buy into it if instead
you buy into a model in which each
individual can have access to the tools
of success that doesn't make it easy you
still get out to work but if you take a
positive
approach which I'm completely dedicated
to helping any young person learn that
and again for free right I'm not selling
the service I'm trying for free to tell
people how to break out of their little
mental prison that mostly white people
have put them in plus a bunch of race
grifters like candy and
a lot of other people who are just
 so don't let make you
think that it's black and white we don't
have a black and white problem except
that we've been told to have one you've
been sold to division so that the people
in charge presumably don't have any heat
on them
in other news
there's a big population decline in Asia
big population decline in Asia
and I'm guessing I won't be monetized
today on YouTube
did you know that China's South Korea
and Japan are all having major
population declines I didn't know how
bad it was
but you have to you know yeah you need a
reproduction rate of 2.1
to or greater to build your population
and right now the fertility rate in
Japan is 1.3
it's not even close
I didn't know that like I knew that you
needed to be 2.1 to grow your population
but I would have guessed it was more
like 1.9
it's 1.3
that is a major problem
and it's even worse in South Korea
in South Korea it's 0.81
0.81 so 2.1 is Break Even to you know
stay ahead
they're they're dead
and apparently they've all spent money
to try to get the you know the birth
rate up but money doesn't do it
yeah money won't do it didn't make any
difference
so there's something about the way
Society is organized and I'm thinking
that well this is some speculation the
part of it is the changing rules of men
and women what do you think
is it purely economical
or is it the fact that we're just not
organized as a the point of the mom is
to have babies
you know if your point is not to have
babies like you're born thinking well
that's sort of my role in life I grow up
and have babies now I'm not saying you
that should be your life
I'm saying that that just is a change
I think that's maybe at least a third of
it maybe a third of his economics
maybe a third of it is
selfishness or something else
but uh yeah this problem is going to
come back to us the United States
already here I guess at the moment the
United States has massive immigration
and that's not really a option in Japan
or South Korea or China is it like I
don't see any of those countries
adopting massive immigration the United
this is one of those uh
here's the good news you want any of the
good news
I think the United States
is the best country in the world
for mixing
people especially immigrants
part of it is the size you know we've
got some scale but I don't think any
country is more successful or will be
of incorporating and you know making
productive people who
just got into the country
it could be somebody says Brazil I don't
know too much about Brazil
um Canada Canada too maybe
but I think that that ability
might be what protects the country in
the future if this population thing
keeps happening
the U.S will be the only one that's got
a growing population doing it the hard
way through immigration or maybe that's
the easy way I don't know
you say Australia
so there might be a few other countries
but it could be that we could certainly
imagine
a world in which uh Mass illegal
immigration is what saved you
is that possible the mass illegal
immigration
would be one of our greater economic
strengths
because remember you know I'll agree
with the notion that mass immigration
has an immediate cost
right the the year somebody comes in
it's just probably more cost than
benefit
but if the alternative is a shrinking
population
that's really bad that's really bad so
immigration has its own set of problems
which nobody's ignoring I mean we're all
aware that it has a set of problems but
it might be actually necessary
you know the the one thing about the
future that we can all agree on
nobody can predict it
have you ever noticed that nobody could
predict anything
you know what it was what two years ago
China was gonna grow forever and run
everything and you know Russia was one
of the major powers and now they don't
even have a military that anybody cares
about and like everything's different in
just a few years so I wouldn't be
surprised if our narrative about
immigration turns from oh no it's mostly
bad conservatives would say to oh I
guess we kind of needed that
that's something that would totally
happened
all right Trump's back on Facebook I
guess maybe that happened a few days ago
I don't think he's going back on Twitter
what do you think I think that as long
as he has some economic interest in
truth socially just can't go back on
Twitter
for business reasons
but I don't know if truth social would
last beyond Trump
see that's a big question for truth will
truth still be as interesting if Trump
you know let's say you lost an election
and retired
I don't know it might be more
interesting because he might you know
create a media Empire or something
well here is the most interesting story
of the day
uh Elon Musk says that Twitter will use
AI in the coming months to detect and
highlight manipulation of public opinion
on this platform
now
a number of people
interpreted this as he was going to use
AI to censor stuff
he didn't say that he didn't say AI was
going to you know censor anything
Greg hey Gregory
you are a piece of
Gregory Wright you're just a complete
 you know I wonder how much
people understand that the difference
between what they do sorry there's just
a somebody said I should have dinner
with Nick Fuentes
talk about
talk about missing the point like Greg
you're just
a Barnacle on the ass of life
yeah you're like a pimple on a on a
Serial Killer's balls
you are worthless
because that comment had no use in
modern and useful Society it was it was
just a negative for somebody who's
actually trying to make a difference
like do you think I'm trying to make
things worse Greg do you think that this
rant and my prior one was all about
making stuff worse is that what you
think is that what you got out of all
this that's that's the best you could do
that was the highest level your brain
could go all Nick Fuentes whoa great job
Greg
I don't think social media is for you
all right what else is going on
let's talk about the hunter Biden files
so I've recommended this account before
on Twitter uh connect kanikoa
the Great
anyway he's got a long thread now some
of this is stuff you've heard
but I just want to put it in the context
of trump being arrested
right think about what Trump is alleged
to have done
which is used a sort of a trick to pay
off Stormy Daniels in a way that it
wouldn't look like he was paying her
directly
so that that's basically what the
alleged crime is about
now first of all I don't even think it
should be your crime but okay let's say
it is let's compare that to what Hunter
and the Biden crime family are alleged
to have done this is just a sample and a
very long thread
um and I'll read uh kanakoa's words here
he said among other things he said the
Biden sold access to the highest levels
of the US government to officials linked
to Chinese intelligence would you agree
this statement is correct based on the
text and the emails we've seen and the
answer is yes the the emails say it
directly so yeah the bidens did sell
access
to the highest levels of the government
to to people known to be linked closely
linked to Chinese intelligence
all right in 2017 email Hunter wrote
that the cefc is this company the
Chinese company linked to the government
salr said that uhming had agreed to
quote to a raid of 10 million dollars
per year for a three-year guarantee of
30 million for quote
introductions alone
just introductions
30 million dollars to the Biden family
which then they shared among them
for introductions
now
that's legal right
that's completely legal isn't it
can anybody
as far as I know if you were
I don't know if you'd have to be a
registered is it a pharah thing would it
would it be uh it's not the Logan Act is
it
yeah so there might be some like
technical things he should have done you
know Maybe
but I think it's legal if you
if you're uh not hiding it I think it's
legal maybe the Logan I know I don't
know my law well enough to to know what
is is not legal there but certainly we
can't be comfortable with it
yeah I think we could say if it is legal
it definitely should not be
if it is
some other things on January 3rd 2019
100 Biden admitted that the Biden family
was a criminal organization that
funneled money to Joe Biden for the last
three decades well calling it a criminal
organization that would depend if these
are technically crimes but there doesn't
seem to be any doubt that the family
operated as a unit
to shake down other countries
for access
so to me it looks like sort of a you
know Shakedown access kind of a model
and that's what it looks like that's all
we can know at this point uh and at one
point Hunter wrote in an email to
somebody he says but don't worry unlike
pop meaning Joe Biden I won't make you
give me half your salary
so this would indicate that Joe was
hiding the fact that he was receiving
money in large amounts
let me ask you this
if you give large amounts of money to
somebody
don't you have to claim that on your
taxes
it's a gift right
if you give anybody more than what ten
thousand dollars or something a year
yeah above 10 000 you have to claim it
under your taxes do you think he claimed
it on his taxes
I don't know would it be income
thank you I appreciate that or would it
would it be uh
wouldn't Joe Biden have to claim it as
income no not income
if it's not if it's not income
why is he working for the money
if you do work which is the
introductions you provide a work payment
and then somebody pays you for that work
you tell me that's not taxable
okay I'm no tax accountant but if you
agree to do work and then you're paid
for that work that is a taxable event
I'm sorry
there's no accountant who's going to
talk me out of that
like I don't have a CPA but you're not
going to talk me out of work for money
not being taxable in the United States
that's very taxable you think that was
claimed on his taxes of course not
of course not
is that a bigger deal than whatever
Trump is accused of
yeah like a lot bigger deal a lot
what else let's say uh
um in
2018 Joe Biden called Hunter Biden to
discuss the New York Times article
detailing his sons dealing with the
quote spy chief of China and Biden said
to Hunter on that he said I think you're
clear which basically proved that he did
talk to Hunter about his dealings with
China
so you know Joe Biden saying I don't
know anything about this was obviously
not true
um
in 2017 FBI agents arrested under
Biden's business partner Patrick ho
the Spy chief of China for bribing the
president of Chad and uganda's foreign
minister okay so we do know that Hunter
Biden's business partner is not only the
Spy chief of China but for some reason
he got arrested
for well not some reason but he was
arrested for bribing the president of
Chad and Uganda
so we know he's a spy Chief who bribes
governments
we know he's a spy Chief who bribes
governments
he's a Serial government briber
so it's like his old job is bribing
government people and Hunter was working
with him and he gave Hunter money
for introductions
do you remember that the money would
Hunters uh
Hunter's lawyer called that good faith
seed money there was a separate payment
a different one but it was just good
faith seed money
because that's really a thing no that's
not a thing
yeah no that doesn't exist there's no
such thing as a good faith seed money
that's called a bribe
uh
when Tony when Tony bobolinski so this
was also Hunter's partner expressed
concern about the Biden's ability to
overrule him on corporate decisions
Hunter let bobolinski know that the cefc
that's that company in China China
energy was in business to quote to be
partners with the bidens and that quote
the number one
meaning president XI has made that clear
Chinese
so that that President XI according to
Hunter made it clear that the China
energy wasn't business to be partners
with the bidens so we have it
this links
president XI of China
with a known uh government briber
who's a Serial briber of governments and
then Hunter describes that that is their
relationship it's a bribery relationship
he just doesn't use the word bribery
he says it directly
now I don't know the difference between
bribing for access
we're paying for access
versus actually getting a different
decision now if if they're bribing the
U.S government or somebody to make a
different decision well that's as
illegal as you could be but is it as
illegal to have access
well if it's China
it's not good it's not good
all right
Hunter Biden acted as a quote personal
attorney to the this China Energy
company and yay mang in a 9 billion deal
to purchase 14 of Russian oil giant at
rosneft
so
here the bidens we're also bailing out
Putin
they're bailing out Russia because
rosenth had a bunch of sanctions on it
so I had to sell so buy it and help them
sell
again probably not technically illegal
but do you want do you want Hunter to be
bailing Putin out for the benefit of
China
I mean this is just so bad even if it's
not illegal but apparently people who
know what is and is not legal have
claimed that there are hundreds of laws
broken in this you know episode of
Hunter in China I don't know about that
but the claim is hundreds of laws broken
um the bidens received at least 31
million from Chinese businessmen linked
to the highest levels of Chinese
intelligence
that should be the whole story right
if all you knew is they got 31 million
uh
yeah if that's all you knew that that
should be enough to you know move on it
um here Roger admitted in his own words
this business partners worked for
Chinese intelligence
he once said in one of his uh emails I
guess quote my representation of the
effin spy chief of China
so he was he was aware that he was a
lawyer for the Spy chief of China
now again I don't know if that's illegal
but could it be worse I don't think it
could be worse
it just seems illegal
seems illegal
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
should get be canceled for everything
and uh
let's go about our day today
and watch the outrages that are being
perpetrated on the people of this
country
and
I hope you enjoyed the show I'm going to
say bye to YouTube maybe forever
if I'm not back here today you could
look for it on locals or Rubble we'll
we'll see how YouTube deals with this by
the way
did I violate every YouTube
terms did you see me violate any terms
of service
I don't believe so
you know I I swore a little bit
but it was in context
yeah you know if you swear in context
meaning that
you know it's it's something you mean as
opposed to just being something that
swears a lot there should be a
difference because one of them is for
purpose and the other is gratuitous
gratuitous wearing I'm not in favor of I
I don't even like it when comedians use
the f word too much so it's just too
gratuitous but if you're genuinely mad
about something that really should you
should be mad about yeah
Let It Go that's what it's for that's
what swearing's for all right I'll talk
to you tomorrow YouTube I hope
bye for now
