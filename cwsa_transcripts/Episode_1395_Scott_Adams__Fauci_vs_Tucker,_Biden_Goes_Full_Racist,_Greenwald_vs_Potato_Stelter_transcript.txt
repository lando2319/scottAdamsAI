hey everybody
come on in come on in i'm still alive
that's right i got my second vaccination
the other day
let me tell you it was moderna second
vaccination and let me tell you
that second vaccination sometimes
can kick your ass but it's about 24
hours of
unpleasantness i'm back i would say
i think i'm 100 i don't feel any
lingering
carryover but if you'd like to know how
yesterday went
yesterday was not fun
yesterday was not fun the the discover
never got higher than say a four and a
ten
but it's all day and if you've got a
discomfort that's a four out of ten
and it lasts all day uh you're not going
to have a good day
but it's also not the biggest problem in
the world and i knew it would be gone in
a day
and everything is good now and i
am protected protected
allegedly we'll find out
but why are you here why are you here
probably because you want to enjoy the
simultaneous sip and all the goodness
that comes with it
and if you'd like to do that all you
need is a copper margaret glass a tanker
chalice's dinette canteen jugger flask a
vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the dopamine
hit of the day
with just a little bit of oxytocin this
time a little bit of flavoring
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now
all over the world go
um
well that'll make the news go down
better won't it
so if you would like to feel good
and and don't you don't you want to feel
good let me tell you how to feel good
find my twitter account and near the top
of it you'll see i retweeted from
axios at the article with one of the
best
graphics i've seen of the trend line of
the coronavirus
and watching that virus go up in
you know january and peaking and then
down you know because it's animated and
then you see it's
we're actually at the lowest point since
the
pandemic began let me say that again
we're at the lowest point in the united
states
since the pandemic began in march
2020 huh
did you know that did you know that we
reached our all-time low
just now we just did it let's have a
hand
for the united states
and all the other countries around the
world who are doing a great job israel
in particular
doing great and
i gotta say that just playing that
little graphic
and watching that go up and then
watching
human ingenuity drive that freaking
thing down to the
down into the dirt it's really really
good feeling and i got to tell you being
fully vaccinated
in this context you know i know there
are some skeptics out there and i'm not
discounting that
but it feels really good so today i
would say
my attitude about the pandemic
is by far the best it's ever been now
as somebody's saying it's not over yet
dr fauci thinks that
maybe it'll last forever you know maybe
there'll just always be
some stuff out there now i don't want to
be a
let's say a doubting person a skeptic if
you will but
uh have you had any questions about why
it takes
two vaccinations for this vaccination
but it feels like everything else
in the past was one vaccination have you
ever asked yourself
what's up with that well
i'm gonna just speculate all right so
there's no
no facts or evidence behind what i'm
gonna say next
but i have been in meetings at big
corporations
where i've worked so i've had lots of
experience at two major corporations
where i was behind the door
helping to make some decisions so i kind
of know how things go in a corporate
environment and i think it goes like
this
hey we're going to need to rush to make
a vaccination
what should we do well
the the best thing we can do is make it
like every other one
but we don't know the exact
thing to test because you could test
everything from one small shot small
dose
to one large dose or
two smaller doses one after the other
and you can't test them all
so you're gonna have to test something
right
you're gonna have to pick one or maybe
two but probably just one
approach and just see if you can warp
speed it through and
because you can't test everything
there's just no way to do it all
so you got to pick you got to you got to
guess i think this is our best bet
and then just test that one thing and
hope you get it now that's what happened
they they largely tested one approach
the double vaccination for at least for
the two vaccinations
and they seemed to get a good result so
they went with it
my understanding is they're going to
test lower doses
for the the two vaccines but
imagine you're behind the door and
you're one of the vaccination companies
do you think that you charge the same
for
one dose versus two now of course you
and i are if you're in america you're
getting it for free
but the government's paying right so i
assume that the government is writing a
check
for each dose right
now you're a corporation and you could
say we could test
one dose and we might get like greater
than 90 percent
but we can also test two doses
make twice as much money
right it's twice as much money
would the government not pay for the
second dose
in the pandemic put on your negotiating
hat
uh i can save the world but uh just just
one wrinkle
unlike all of the other vaccinations
this one's going to take two doses each
of those doses
will cost as much as a regular one dose
but now there's two of them
twice twice as many doses
so do you think that science
drove the decision for two doses
do you do you really think the science
drove the decision
for the two doses
no no no it did not
i had a ruined day yesterday
because i got the second dose i'm
following the guidelines
maybe i shouldn't but i'd like to travel
and i'd like to have fewer restrictions
on me so i did it
yeah i don't think that that was a
science decision
now it could have been a good risk
management decision because maybe the
two doses
is closer to a guarantee that it works
than the one dose
you could make the argument that it was
risk management
but i feel like money is always
predictive
and if there's one approach that gives
you twice as much money
and the other side can't even negotiate
because it's a pandemic
what are you going to do can you lower
the price on that
no not really they're going to get any
price they want so they just make it two
doses instead of one i think that's what
happened
or at least you have to worry about that
uh if you're not watching the interplay
between
one of china's i assume professional
trolls
named chen
wow wow i don't know if i'm pronouncing
right
w-e-i-h-u-s way
we how way wow i don't know but
twitter uh twitter brands his uh
twitter account as china
state-affiliated media
so according to twitter this guy works
for the chinese government
um but he says he doesn't he says his
opinions are his own
so he's been uh you know coming into
tweets that i've been involved with
and he and i have become acquainted
online so
chen and i uh sometimes trade tweets
like yesterday
traded a few tweets and
here's the thing is this gonna work out
well for him
because because i'm a professional
meaning that i'm a professional
communicator
and a professional humorist beyond that
i'm skilled in persuasion
jen is a guy on twitter
and i was actually worrying today that i
could get him executed
like actually executed because
it isn't hard to completely humiliate
him online
i mean he doesn't act humiliated of
course but it's pretty easy to make fun
of him
and to call out what's happening
uh no such thing as science only mass
hysteria
maple bob says you're not you're not far
off
um and so i was worried that if i
if i get the if i get too much of these
exchanges that china will just execute
this guy
uh for embarrassing their country um
but as but so far uh chen is a great
representative of what we call west
west taiwan some people call it china
but i saw somebody on twitter refer to
china as
western taiwan to which i said
okay speaking of persuasion have you all
been following
uh corey deangelis who's uh
been persuading against the teachers
unions
to try to get more competition in
schools
and corey did a little poll today and of
course this is highly
uh unscientific poll
but he asked this question how have your
views about teachers unions changed
since march 2020. now of course that's
the beginning of the pandemic
so this is how people's views about
teachers unions have changed
the number who have a less favorable
view 89
percent have a less favorable view
of teachers unions but there are also
people have a more favorable view
one percent one percent
one percent that's it and ten percent
think it's the same
now uh i don't know what this would have
looked like a year ago
maybe teachers unions were were always a
little disliked
but it feels to me that he's moved the
bar
a lot and of course the pandemic helped
right because there was something
specific
that you could watch the teachers unions
be unhelpful
and somebody says one percent are in the
teachers unions or maybe married to a
teacher that's probably true
so um as i've pointed out before
this the way the way
our system has evolved is that there are
a number of
number of decisions that seem to grow
out of the public
as opposed to the politicians making
decisions and debating them
it seems like there are some topics that
our politicians just can't handle for
whatever reason
and then the public has to take it on
themselves i think the question of
wearing masks
has already transferred into the public
we just haven't seen that expressed yet
so the public will decide what masks are
done they won't be the experts
at this point in the pandemic end of the
pandemic
and likewise
i think the public will decide whether
they can put up with a lack of school
options and what they can and whether
they can put up with the teachers unions
and you know it's not that the public
can directly make them go away
but certainly the public can force more
competition
it looks like corey deangelis is making
this happen
now i of course have been boosting him
as much as possible
so you know you know when i retweet him
it's another
600 000 plus people who see it so i'm
doing what i can
to help uh but man
that's some seriously good persuasion
and lays out the pandemic helped um are
you watching the battle between uh glenn
greenwald and brian stelter
you know so so what's happening is uh
glenn greenwald
he appears more on fox news than on
other
major outlets and the reason is that fox
news
invites him that's why he appears on fox
news
because he's invited do you know why he
doesn't appear on cnn
they don't invite us do you know why he
doesn't appear on msnbc so much i mean
he has in the past
but do you know why he doesn't do us so
much now they don't invite
him and i guess the problem is that he
says things which are
you know true and not specific to any
left or right side
and that makes him a right wing
according to the left
they're trying to brand him as right
wing now what makes him effective
besides the fact that he's hilariously
uh let's say uh biting
in his commentary i mean he just writes
well and it's fun to watch he's he's
provocative
but he also was making a huge dent
and and the democrats are taking a
beating from some of his
uh his writing and commentary and so it
looks like they've decided to target him
for
elimination so now cnn went after him
and
brian stelter in particular and i can't
stop seeing in my head
a potato on a vegematic do you know the
vegematic or
is anybody old enough to remember that
it was a thing for slicing vegetables
and i just see a potato
you know stelter and i see green
greenwald as the vegematic it doesn't
look like a fair fight
uh and and then i looked at the daily
beast as a big you know
a hit piece on him so if the daily beast
is going after him and cnn is going
after him and they're trying to paint
him as a right-wing
crazy person which isn't working because
he doesn't say anything that's even a
little bit crazy he's not even close
right uh so he doesn't buy him to the
conspiracy theories or
anything else you you would imagine
could be in the far right wing anyway
but here's the thing there's this long
criticism
of glenn greenwald and i read it and i'm
looking for the criticism
now generally if there's a criticism
piece
it would include some criticism but
instead it was all things like
he's associated with tucker carlson and
he's been on laura ingraham's show and
fox news really likes him yeah fox news
really likes him
and the entire thing was just a smear by
association
there was no content i don't i don't
believe there was anything that they
said about him
where he had lied or cheated or gotten
something wrong nothing
there was actually no criticism they
actually wrote a hit piece
without any hints because they didn't
have anything it was they were
completely empty
so this tells you that he's uh certainly
making a dent
and they're trying to try to mute his
attacks
but he's also in this weird situation
because he's on sub stack
which means that the more attention he
gets from his critics
the richer he gets because people will
say
who are you talking about oh glenn
greenwald
what's he saying oh he's saying
interesting things
oh he has a sub stack account next thing
you know they're subscribing to his sub
stack account
so uh while cnn's ratings are down 70
from whatever their high was during
trump uh and i guess brian stelter's
show is
struggling as well
every time that they fight cnn loses
viewers and greenwald gets richer
so go ahead and fight with them i guess
if you want
i've got a question about all these
ransomware attacks
and by the way gordon chang had a good
uh a good uh
framing for this he said in a tweet that
president biden is not responsible for
the colonial pipeline hack you know that
was just a criminal act
or maybe maybe russia was behind it we
don't know
but gordon says he is responsible
meaning biden for the recent ransomware
attack on jbs
the meet meat processing company
and gordon says it's because he invited
this new attack by allowing colonial to
pay a ransom
what did he think was going to happen
next
good question so here's my question
number one
oh is there an uh an industry
uh let's say an industry economic
opportunity here
don't you think that somebody should be
making a product
that is the backup of all backups
something that
can zero out a system completely
and then reboot it with with a mirror
image of the software as it existed on
whatever day
it seems to me that somebody needs to
invent
the ransomware uh correction
software there's got to be a way
to simply wipe all systems and then
and then repopulate them somebody says
that would also be hackable of course
yeah i mean if they managed to get the
get their software into the copy as well
somebody says it's just
expensive i'm just looking at some of
your comments because
most of you are smarter than i am about
technology or many of you are
and so he says blockchain i don't know
already exists companies just don't use
it somebody says
well that's what i would expect so
here's my question to you
find me the software company uh
find me the company who does this find
me the company who protects against
ransomware
because i'd like to invest in that
company
i'm hearing that youtube is throttling
my audience
is that happening i don't know that
that's happening
you can't really tell
yeah all right so and
i wonder at what point given that russia
actually warned us
that they were going to make us
uncomfortable and that these are russian
hackers
and it's hard to believe that putin
can't find a russian hacker
do you believe he can't find a russian
hacker i feel like he could
right so he's at least allowing it to
happen
and it makes me wonder what we're doing
in return
it better be something you know i was
reading an opinion that the only way
these ransomware attacks will stop
is if we take down a country take down a
country
to make them stop and i would say
that maybe the second time you know this
meat packing company
maybe this isn't time to take down
russia
but at some point you have to turn the
lights off in russia
if only for an hour just to let them
know
that we're not we're not screwing around
anymore
so i don't i just don't know what you do
about this but we need to put some
pressure on russia
like they've never seen before because i
don't think anybody believes they can't
control these criminal
gangs in russia kristin cinema
democrats arizona uh
is kind of interesting here's something
she said that you you'd never see
it's just like well not never but it's
so rare
to see somebody say something honest in
politics
that it really caught my caught my
attention so first of all she says she
likes the filibuster
which is not really a democratic view at
the moment because they'd like to get
rid of it
so they can pass a bunch of legislation
just by a simple majority
but the filibuster makes for many of the
bills
they have to have you know 60 uh
60 support and so the filibuster can
basically
effectively stop anything that doesn't
have overwhelming support
and she says that's good because you
don't want things like ricocheting back
and forth
every time the political leadership
changes
you want it hard to change anything
that's her point of view and i agree
with it you do want it hard
to change anything because then you know
you're only getting the changes that
matter
but here's support the interesting thing
she said i'll read it as a quote
so kristen cinema says i do not believe
the additional extraneous commission
now this is talking about the proposed
commission for
looking into the january six events she
says i do not believe the additional
extraneous commission
that democrat leaders want wouldn't
would uncover crucial new facts or
promote healing
uh oh
i'm sorry this is not her quote this is
actually
never mind it's actually mcconnell's
quote
uh damn it they stuck a mechanical quote
in a
christian cinema thing and i thought it
was hers so
um i'm sorry i just wasted your last
minute there's nothing we can do about
that
it's it's completely it's gone now
we can't get it back so i apologize for
that minute
that you completely wasted so forget
about this story
there's nothing here uh
president biden has gone full racist
here's a quote from jeffrey dove jr
now jeffrey dove is a black american
which is important to the story
when can i stop saying that please
please when can i stop telling you
what somebody's ethnic affiliation is
before i tell you the news like my god
how can we get past that it's just this
is the most ridiculous thing but
here we are so i'm still doing it so
jeffrey dove jr who is a black american
says about biden in a tweet he says why
is it that every time he speaks about
the black community
he makes us seem incapable of the
simplest tasks
whether it's getting an id card using
the internet
to make an appointment or now this and
this was
biden said young black entrepreneurs are
just as capable of succeeding
given the chance as white entrepreneurs
are but they don't have lawyers
they don't have accountants and as
jeffrey points out
why is it you think black people can't
get an id
or that black people uh you can't use
the internet or that black people
can't find a lawyer or an accountant i'm
pretty sure that's a problem with all
poor people
right did it have to do with being black
or does it have to do with being poor
how many people in poverty can get
themselves a lawyer and an accountant
zero
zero maybe uh but
the way biden talks about this stuff
it just screams racist doesn't it
doesn't it if if he's calling out that
black people
have trouble getting ids but nobody else
does
right nobody else has trouble getting an
id but according to biden
this is like a special problem for black
people
that's got to be racist are you telling
me there are no
poor white people in whatever
circumstance who also have trouble
getting an id
of course there are i mean if anybody
has trouble it's going to be everybody
who's poor or in a bad situation
and for some reason biden thinks that
these are that he needs to tell us and
he and here's the one that
that's just like slaps you in the face
biden thinks he needs to tell us
that young black entrepreneurs are just
as capable of succeeding
uh as white entrepreneurs
i feel like i knew that is there
somebody who doesn't know that
it's 2021. we had a black president for
eight years
i think people understand that black
people can do stuff
why are we even talking like this can
you imagine
just imagine trump saying any of these
things
can you imagine trump saying that black
people have trouble getting id
i mean seriously imagine him saying that
and he never did did he have you ever
heard trump
say anything like these three different
things that biden has said in which he
has to
remind you that black people could do
well too
of course not trump would never say that
and i mean if if you were likely to say
it he would have said it by now
and you know why he wouldn't say that
because it's up
it's up this is totally up
oh yeah black people can do just as well
as white people
did you know have you heard the news
this is like you know usually i don't
get uh
like offended on behalf of other people
because i think it's stupid
you know you should get you can get
offended on behalf of yourself
and probably you don't need to do that
either but being offended
on behalf of somebody else that's a
waste of time usually
but i gotta say like i'm literally i
feel offended
that my president biden
that he talks this way it's offensive
so i agree with uh jeffrey dove jr on
this
all right
here's a little update clarification i
remember i talked yesterday if you saw
it
that uh texas was noodling on some
legislation i don't know where it stands
now
that would change the the voting
availability on sunday
in texas and there's a weird little
story here about that
that i learned since then that i don't
know what is true and what is not so you
you uh make the decision it goes like
this
apparently the the law change was going
to suggest
that you couldn't vote on a sunday
before 1 pm
you could vote from 1 until like 9 at
night but you couldn't start before 1 pm
now the thinking was that this was a
voter suppression
because traditionally the black churches
would
get everybody excited in church and say
hey let's all go vote
and they would they would get a really
good turnout because they would go from
church
to voting booth and and it was just a
good way to get everybody on board
but if they had to wait till 1 pm that's
way too long after church
so it doesn't really work right people
are more likely to go home
and then you lose the energy et cetera
so
as it was suggested that this was
overtly racist and
intending to suppress the vote of
black church-going people and that was
an argument
i was willing to listen to right
it's a reasonable argument but
today we learn that according to at
least some politicians in texas
it was a typo
a typo that it was always meant to be
11am but it was a typo that turned it
into 1pm
or you know miscommunication not
necessarily a typo but
the claim now is that it was always
meant to be 11 a.m which would probably
work perfectly with the the church thing
and that the republicans not the
democrats the republicans are saying oh
we'll change this back to 11 that that
was not intended
i don't know you buying it yeah and then
there's a was there a typo that went
from am to pm
now you can you can imagine the am pm
thing happening because if anybody said
it's
it's one o'clock your brain would say
well it's not one am
so you might just automatically change
it to pm when you wrote it
yeah i'm not sure i buy the story right
yeah your skepticism is warranted
but my guess is there may have been some
people who
were trying to be clever and maybe other
republicans who
would not have done that and when they
saw that it was done
said ah no we're actually trying to fix
things not suppress things
so i think there might have been a
little difference of opinion there
if you're following persuasion the
vaccination persuasion game
is really interesting because now all of
the easy to vaccinate people
are getting vaccinated you're down to
the the tough cases the people who are
on the fence the people who maybe
don't want a vaccination now separating
from the question of whether they should
be vaccinated
let's hold that separate if you wanted
them to be vaccinated how would you
persuade them
well one of the things is i guess
budweiser is offering a free beer
for anybody who gets a vaccination now
what's your first impression of that
right what's your first impression
well my first impression is gosh
nobody's going to risk their life for a
beer
and nobody's even going to risk having
24 hours of discomfort
like i had yesterday nobody's going to
risk that for
a beer like one beer
right and then there are all these other
offers that different states are doing
like
black-owned barbershops i don't know i
get a free haircut
parents who get the shots get free child
care
while they're inoculated and so there
are various little tax credits and
things like that
now here's the thing not one of these
incentives
is anywhere near the value of the
vaccination
the it's like getting a i don't know
just a grain of sand
that's a terrible analogy but it is a
terrible reward
because the thing that you're being
rewarded for is way more important than
a beer
or a haircut so is it good persuasion or
bad go
in the comments in the comments is it
good persuasion or bad
to offer rewards that are trivial
good persuasion bad i see bad bad bad
bad good somebody said good contrarian
um i'm saying bad bad
bad bad we got a good stefan says good
bad bad depends
good bad here's the answer good
it's good it's unambiguously absolutely
totally good and here's why
it's something i learned in dog training
class seriously i took a class to
train my dog snickers and the
professional trainer
taught us this trick she said dogs
can't do fractions meaning
you can get a dog to do a trick for a
nice big treat
but you can get that dog to do exactly
the same trick
for a little piece of that treat just
like so little that you can barely hold
it into your thumb and finger
and that dog will do the same treat or
the same trick
for a fraction of the treat
do you know who else does that people
human beings right human beings will do
tricks
for treats no matter how big the tree
is the treat can be trivial
and you'll still do it why
well my best interpretation of this is
what i'd call the fake
because meaning that there are people
who are on the fence about the
vaccination
and maybe there's a little peer pressure
maybe their friends are saying
i'm not getting it and you're like i
don't want to do what my friends are not
doing
if my friends say they're not getting
him maybe i won't get it
you're sort of on the fence in
persuasion
there's something called the fake
because i named it actually
and the fake because is a reason that's
not a real reason
it's the reason that's not a real reason
and when you use that
is when somebody's already leaning in
your direction
they're already halfway there they're
like leaning and all you need to do is
like
tap and they go over right
the fake because doesn't work at all if
somebody's completely opposed
right you're not going to change
anybody's mind with a fake because if
they're really really solid on the other
side
the only time you use it is if
somebody's like well i'm uncertain
i'm uncertain i'll have a beer i'll have
a beer
oh okay get a vaccination for a beer
because you know i was thinking about it
and i probably would have said yes i
don't know i probably would have said
yes but
one way i get a beer the other way i
don't get a beer
i'll take a beer how about a free
haircut
sure so here's the tricky here's the
part
if you look at all these incentives and
you're not
a persuasion you know trained person
you'd say to yourself
this can't work because the incentives
are way too small
you're wrong you're wrong those tiny
little incentives
will move a lot of people who just
wanted any
reason just give me any reason doesn't
have to make sense
doesn't have to be a big reason doesn't
even have to it could be irrational
completely irrational i'll still do it
yeah
so that's good persuasion and uh when my
government is
and governments because the states are
mostly doing this when i see my
governments doing this kind of stuff
i like it this is a confidence builder
for me
because this is the right thing to do
this assumes that you think also that
people should get vaccinated uh let's
talk about fouchy versus tucker
how many of you believe in the comments
i want to see this
in the comments how many of you believe
that the fouchy emails have shown
that he lied on something
important how many of you think that the
fouchy emails are like a smoking gun
and when you look at those emails it's
play this day that he
fooled the country uh i'm going to look
at your comments i see
no yes yes no maybe not sure no
nope it doesn't doubt it 50 50 don't
know
you're all over the place aren't you how
could you be so all over the place
how is that possible because the news
has been out there for a while right
and you're seeing very prominent people
saying yes he lied
i'm saying yes yes no smoking gun yes he
did
no he didn't you're all over the map
why is that well let me tell you how to
sort this out okay
here's how you would approach this
question because it is it's a little
confusing
no it's not a little confusing it's
really confusing
and i'm going to take you through it a
little bit and try to sort this out the
number one thing you ask yourself is
where is the news that fauci lied
or that he did something horrible where
where is it being reported if you go to
cnn
is cnn reporting that fouchy's emails
have a smoking gun and a problem in them
is cnn reporting it
no no cnn doesn't see any problem
how about msnbc is msnbc reporting that
a problem has been found in the emails
nope nope is fox news
reporting that there's a problem in the
emails
let me let me ask you this question is
fox news reporting it that's the only
question i want to see the answers
most of you probably watch it i see a
yes
um is fox news reporting it yes yes yes
i'm looking at your comments yes fox is
reporting it yes yes yes
you're all wrong you're i think you're
all wrong
i don't believe fox news is reporting it
you're seeing the opinion people right
now the fox news might have some guests
on and
you know the guests are saying stuff but
are any of the news
people on fox the news people not the
opinion people
remember tucker's opinion remember laura
in graham is opinion
so somebody says bear reported it
what did he report did bret bear report
that there's a controversy because that
would be true
did he report that people are looking at
what fouchy said
and they're questioning whether it
questioning whether it
is compatible because that would be true
people are questioning it
but did brett bear report that fouchy
lied and the then the email proves it
i haven't seen all of bret bear's
reports but i'm bad now
about now so i'm going to take you
through it
uh as you know tucker has got some
comments
adam townsend uh if you don't follow him
on twitter you're missing a good show
so adam townsend tweeted this about this
controversy
he says you're all you're all going to
look like
tin foil hatters to any normies
you'll say quote but but the fouchy
leaks
they'll say okay show me the email that
sends fouchy to jail
and then you start rambling crazy
so find me the part in fouchy's email
that is your problem find it just show
it to me
here's uh here's what happened when uh
tucker tried to do this
here's something that fauci said and i'm
going to compare this
to tucker's interpretation all right
so if she did say a group
at one point during the pandemic he said
this a group of highly qualified
evolutionary virologists
looked at these sequences there and the
sequences and bats
as they evolved and the mutations that
it took to get to that point
were where now is totally consistent
with a jump of a species from an animal
to human
all right so what he's saying is that
the
the possibility that it was just a
naturally occurring virus
that what they knew at the time is
totally consistent with that hypothesis
right now when you say something is
totally consistent
with uh with a hypothesis
are you saying that hypothesis is
definitely true
is that the same thing something is
consistent with a hypothesis
is that equal to it's true no
no those are not the same it's just
it just fits the hypothesis if there's
another hypothesis that also fits the
facts
then you have two hypotheses that both
fit the facts
here's how um
here's how i think it was a tucker or
fox news
in an opinion piece they changed
consistent with to decide it
conclusively
so consistent with is what fauci said
it's consistent with
and then it looks like tucker changed
that to decided conclusively
or somebody did on fox news and
is that the same they're not even close
decided conclusively is not even close
to consistent with a hypothesis so
watch the really specific language that
you're saying all right let's do another
one
uh there's this question of who funded
this quote gain of
function stuff so fauci said and there's
this dr barrick who apparently is
central to the question of whether there
is gain of function research and whether
fauci helped get the funding for the
wuhan lab et cetera
so fauci said dr barrick does not do
gain of function research
he doesn't do it all right that's the
first part
and if it is oh so the very next thing
is he softened it he says he doesn't do
it
but if he does all right if it is
it's according to the guidelines so what
fauci is saying is that as far as he
knows barrick doesn't do
gain of function but if he did
it would be according to the guidelines
so is that saying he doesn't do it
no he's not saying he doesn't do it he's
saying if he did
it would be according to the guidelines
and it would be done in north carolina
which is a pretty important point uh
and he says and if you look at the grant
and you look at the progress reports
it is not gain of function despite the
fact that people tweet that and so i
said to myself
what does gain of function be exactly
we all we all think we know what it
means right don't you think you know
what it means
but apparently there are two reasons to
do gain of function
do you know what the two reasons are you
know one reason
which is to turn it into a weaponized uh
virus
right what's the other reason to develop
a vaccine
yeah there are two reasons to do gain of
function
one is to make a weapon which
we don't know for sure anybody's doing
that we assume they are
but the other is to figure out more
about the virus
by making it uh passed to i guess the
example given was and this is from
wikipedia
by the way so here's an example say you
have an influenza b
that can only infect humans and harbor
seals
so you've got this virus it does humans
it does harbor seals
you're trying to find out more about the
virus because that will allow you to
make a vaccination and so if you did a
gain of function
you could introduce a mutation that
would allow it to infect a rabbit
so now you've taken something that
infects two only two species
and you've made it in effect rabbits in
addition that's gain of function
now are you going to die because they
figured out a way to infect
rabbits no i don't think so
i mean unless it gets from the rabbit to
humans but that would not be anticipated
in this
sort of thing but of course there's
always risk
so here's the thing when
dr fauci is saying that dr barrick
is not doing any gain of function stuff
what's that mean because remember gate
of function
is two things it's not one thing so is
he ruling out
both things or is he saying as he said
if it is
is according to the guidelines the way i
interpret that is according to the
guidelines
it might be okay to do like this example
of figuring out how to infect a rabbit
that might be according to the
guidelines i'm just speculating but it
might be
what would not be according to the
guidelines is figuring out how to
weaponize it to kill people probably not
according to the guidelines
so there's one kind of gain of function
that you want and
scientists would agree and there's one
kind that nobody wants
so when fauci says dr barrick is not
doing gain a function
what's he mean what's he mean sounds
like there's a little gray area
about whether you've you've gotten into
that or not
so um so that one's hard to hear
all right here's another one um did
fauci lie
about vaccinations needed for recovered
people
go in the comments do you believe that
fauci
lied when he said he wasn't sure if
people who had been infected with the
covid
he wasn't sure if that gave them lasting
immunity was that a lie
he wasn't sure because they didn't have
data
he wasn't sure that it would give
lasting immunity
but there was a good chance that it
would
uh look at your comments some of you say
he's lying lots of yeses
but lots of no's you're all looking at
the same news
it's the same news why are half of you
saying yes
and half of you saying no let me read
his exact
statement the question was are people
who are recovering from cova generally
immune from reinfection
it's a big question right and fauci's
response was
quote no evidence in this regard but you
would assume
that there would be substantial immunity
post-infection
is that a lie he said there's no
evidence in this regard
is that part of a lie nobody has studied
it yet
by now they have studied it and they
know that they know that it does give
you pretty good protection
but when he said it there was no
evidence but he also said
but you would assume that it would be
substantial
so he's assuming it's true because it's
always true
but this virus has been a little bit
different
and maybe engineered so maybe there's
something different about this one
to me this just looked like a standard
scientific statement
that we don't have any evidence but if
it's like all the other situations you
would expect it to work this way
that is exactly true completely
completely compatible with what we later
learned which is that his assumption was
correct
it does give you lasting immunity this
is called a lie
not one part of that was wrong none of
it
right um
all right then what about the masks
uh in fauci's email to zeke emanuel
he admitted something else uh this is
fox story about this that uh surgical
masks the paper kind that all of us wear
don't really work
i think this is from tucker right
now do you believe that that's true that
is it obvious
that tucker would say the surgical masks
the paper kind we all wear don't really
work
and then the next sentence is they offer
very little protection from covent
but wait a minute those are opposites
those aren't the same thing
these two sentences in the same
paragraph are opposites
or not compatible let's say that they
don't really work
is that the same as they offer very
little protection
because in a game of pandemic if
something offers you very little
protection
you should do it right
because you're trying to get that
reproduction rate under one
so every little bit helps how about
social distancing is that something that
uh let's say to use the words
doesn't really work or is it something
that has very little protection
maybe you would do it anyway if it's a
pandemic
because everything that would help a
little
maybe you should try it now
apparently fauci said in the beginning
that those masks don't make much
difference
and that it's more for the person who's
uh who might be infected
to keep them from spreading it so fancy
said that people agreed
um he admitted he lied about the masks
in the first place and let me ask you
this
the in the comments would you say that
it is now demonstrated
that those kinds of masks work or don't
work
and let me put this out to you i believe
i haven't researched this but i'm pretty
sure it's true there is no
industrialized country
in which the medical experts for that
country
oppose masks for the pandemic
fact check me on this but i don't
believe there's any country
whose experts did not recommend masks
true if so if you think this is some
kind of weird
fouchy-only problem it's the whole world
every major industrial countries
medical experts say the masks work
and that the data is unambiguous
what news are you watching are you
watching the news that says none of
that's true
every major industrial country
says masks work
now somebody says not india um i would i
would be concerned about
maybe supply that could be a problem too
um
somebody says there are a lot of
european countries not recommending
masks
i'll bet that's a lie about that's a lie
certainly there are different
um mask recommendations for situations
right and whether we needed them
outdoors or not that changed over time
but i don't believe there's anybody who
believes that the following
is not a good idea if you're going to
spend time with somebody who has some
comorbidities
and you're going to spend an hour
indoors in the same room
would a mask be a good idea according to
all of the experts of all the
industrialized countries in all the
world
and i think the answer is yes in that
situation
that all the country experts would say
yes not just america
not just fouchy all of them
check me on that now you could have
differences on you know
uh how long you are or you know which
situations but basically
they're all pro masks fact check me on
this
if you can find another industrialized
country
that doesn't think masks ever work in
any situation let me know
tweet that at me okay
so um there's now this
this thing that i'm gonna call pandemic
zombies
so a pandemic zombie would be somebody
whose belief of what happened is forever
wrong
and they'll just be going through life
like a zombie and
one of these beliefs is that the
pandemic never happened
so i see quite a few tweets from people
who believe
we didn't have a pandemic and that the
only thing happened was we were testing
things wrong
and then no we didn't have any excess
deaths we just didn't even have a
pandemic
and there are a lot of people in that
camp and they're going to be walking
through the world
like regular people but they believe no
pandemic happened
there are also people believing that
masks don't work
i would say that that's a zombie belief
now you can be right
by the way you can be right
but it's not because you're smart if
you're right it's just an accident
because as i said all of the industrial
countries
all of their experts agree that mass
work in some situations
all of them so you're the only person in
the world who thinks mass
don't work you're a zombie
uh and then i'm hearing people say that
the vaccinations are not making
any difference to the virus level and
that it's really it's just
warmer weather than vitamin d
really you you don't think we can tell
that the vaccinations work
now if you're saying you're afraid that
there's some you know there might be
some
medical problem down the line from the
vaccination well that's a
at least a legitimate worry we don't
know if it's true
but it's a legitimate worry is it
is it really legitimate to think the
vaccinations are not
decreasing the amount of uh the amount
of
infections but that's not really a
question anymore
so i would say that you're you're a
coveted zombie if you think the pandemic
never happened it was just a testing
artifact
the mass don't work and that it's proven
we've got the proof
they don't work or the vaccinations
didn't make any difference to the
pandemic
those things are those things are not
good thinking yeah and i see people
saying well i'm a zombie
sorry yeah i mean there's nothing you do
about it
people are going to believe that and so
i would like to put this request down to
my critics because i'm seeing
i'm seeing all the narcissist trolls
come in
and here's how you tell a narcissist
troll
versus some other the narcissist troll
will misremember
what you said once they find out they're
wrong
so i'm having a number of people come at
me on twitter saying
well scott you said from the beginning
and then what they say
is just ridiculous something i never
said but they really think i did they're
pretty sure
that i said you know something like
drinking bleach is good for
whatever whatever they say so they're
literally hallucinating
that i got a bunch of stuff wrong about
the pandemic in some cases
things i never even commented on
somebody said glenn says but you did but
you did
yeah if you remember me getting
something wrong about the pandemic
probably it's a false memory probably
um
and actually we can test this out let's
see how many people we have here
what what do you believe in the comments
what do you believe i got wrong about
the pandemic
so see if anybody can actually
accurately say what i said
and then also demonstrate it's wrong
good
net deaths was wrong exactly now the net
deaths
estimate was based on a two-week
shutdown so if it had been two weeks
i think i would have been right or close
to right
but when it turned into a year-long
pandemic then of course
that didn't make any sense then that
deaths were were irrelevant once it
became a long-term problem
now the part i got wrong was believing
that it would be a limited
lockdown or that it would take care of
the problem so i didn't have i don't
think i
disagreed with it working or agreed with
it working i didn't really have an
opinion on that
uh i just said fauci didn't lie
well show me how i'm wrong tell me what
he lied about
he did lie about masks not working so he
could protect the supply
but he's admitted that the pcr tests are
valid for testing i've never given you
an opinion on pcr tests
you're imagining that so that's a
perfect example so somebody says i'm
wrong about
pcr test accuracy i've literally never
had an opinion on that
because to me i wouldn't know i don't
have i i still don't have an opinion on
it
um
michael lindell says there's a big
announcement coming that'll be fun
uh spoke in terms of numbers when you
should have specified percentages
you're gonna have to do better than that
um
lying about mass to protect supply is
still bad
um seen the recent bre weinstein
presentation about
ivor machton i have yes that's very
interesting
yeah the ivermectin story keep an eye on
that
you know i still bet against it working
just based follow the odds but but if it
does
that's a big story
youtube gave him a warning and removed
him my god
uh let's see i want to see if anybody
else thinks i got anything wrong
uh i don't see any here interesting
sweden is a disaster somebody says no
that's not true
um
you don't mind read which is great well
i try not to but everybody does
everybody does a little bit of mind
reading they just don't admit it
all right
all right uh you have no data on the
shot working
of course we do somebody says there's no
data
that the vaccinations work
are you freaking kidding me there's
probably nothing we have more data on
than whether the vaccinations work i
don't think there's anything
more documented than that
um
why did amazon cancel well i don't know
if it was amazon
but um dr fauci's book has some
delay i don't know what that's about we
just have to wait and see on that
that biden handled the pandemic i didn't
say anything about that
uh
happy birthday to miguel sanchez all
right well
interesting i thought you would have
more criticisms of me but i'm glad that
they're not
and on that note let me tell you that
i'm feeling great today
um one day after suffering from the
second
modernish if you're joining me late but
as of today i feel terrific and i'm
fully vaccinated
and you can make your own decisions i
won't tell you what to do
but i'll talk to you
tomorrow you
