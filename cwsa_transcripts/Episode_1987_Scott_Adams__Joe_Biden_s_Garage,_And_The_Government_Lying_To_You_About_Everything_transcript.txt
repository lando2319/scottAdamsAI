is Friday the 13th
and YouTube they tried to stop me the
Gremlins of bad luck
but here I am
yeah here I am and you've managed to
make it here
for the highlight of civilization the
best thing that's ever happened to you
in your whole damn life
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
and I think we all need that because
it's Friday the 13th which I will
reframe in a moment all you need is a
cup of Melgar glass a tanker jealous of
Stein the canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopa Beach of the day
thing makes everything better including
Friday the 13th
happens now go
yeah that's some good stuff
all right watch me reframe Friday the
13th from what some of you think would
be bad luck
into something better are you ready
how many things happened this year that
were just the way you expected them
not very many
it's like opposite world
yeah we just spent years of
investigating Trump for a potential
corruption with foreign countries
what do we find
we found that Joe Biden was corrupt with
foreign countries
how many times have we been told
one thing is true
only to learn that the opposite is true
how about those vaccinations that are
totally stopping the spread of the the
virus
pretty much the opposite of a
vaccination isn't it as in doesn't stop
it at all
so why would Friday 13th be the only
thing this year
that happened just the way
it was presented
no it's probably opposite
probably the luckiest day of the year I
have a prediction that some of you can
have the best day you've ever had in
your whole life
because nothing Is What It Seems
everything is maybe opposite
except for the good news good news is
always exactly what it seems
remember reframes don't need to make
sense
if there's one thing I can teach you
a reframe doesn't have to make logical
sense
it just has to the words just have to
make sense in a sentence and that's good
enough to reprogram your brain
so that's the the hypnotist in me
teaching you that all right lots of
fun stories but I'd like to start with
an inspirational quote
uh from Kamal Harris
and she did a little public speaking
it's always a mistake
but here's an exact quote from Cobble
Harris
I think of this moment as a moment that
is about great moment um
uh inspired by yes optimism but also
inspired by also our Collective effort
to see what can be unburdened but by
what has been
foreign
I didn't make that up
that's a direct quote
from your next president
Maybe
all right here's some good news that I
would like to report
how many of you have heard me bitching
about how sports are all broken
and they're broken because the Sports
were invented 100 years ago and then we
act like nothing changed
so we don't have to change the rules
like tennis for example was completely
destroyed
by the quality of the equipment
improving so you can hit a tennis ball
so quickly that you can guarantee that
the other person won't enjoy playing
guaranteed I can make the other person
totally not enjoy their day oh I can
enjoy it because it's fun to hit really
hard
so if it goes out if it goes in I feel
good but I can make sure you don't enjoy
it just by hitting the hell out of that
ball
so it turns out that somebody
fixed Sports
at least once and here's how they did it
they invented a new sport
and they got rid of all the stupid stuff
that ruined Sports
it's called pickleball
and I was trying to understand why
everybody was asking me like everywhere
have you played pickleball have you
played pickleball have you played
pickleball
and I hadn't until yesterday
so yesterday I you know I have a tennis
court so you can use roughly you could
use a tennis score you just Mark out a
smaller size
and so I you know I just hit the ball
around uh on a little bit of a
pickleball and here's what I discovered
they fixed all the problems
here here's one of the things they fixed
a pickleball paddle is a hard paddle
you never need to
um you never need to tune up your paddle
it's not like tennis where you need to
fix your strings
let me let me tell you something that
only only tennis players know
if you're like a serious weekend tennis
player watch the comments and the tennis
players will confirm this totally
unexpected
the number one correlation
with whether I won my tennis matches
against you know people I played with
all the time where I lost was what was
the number one correlation
how recently I had sprung my racket and
nothing else was even close
there was no other factor that predicted
who would win right now what just watch
the other tennis players they'll tell
you you don't win because usually you
you generally pick a player who's as
close to your ability
and so the entire difference of who wins
that day you can play for two hours
and I can still tell you who's going to
win
it's the one who got their strings uh
changed most recently because it makes
that much difference now paddle
pickleball fixed that you'd never have
to get a restrung the next thing is you
always have your your tennis balls are
always too new or too old
that's something else you wouldn't know
if you didn't play when you take a
tennis ball out of the can it's too new
and even an experienced player has
trouble handling it for several minutes
and then you wear them out a little bit
and then they're good but by the end of
the toward the end they're all worn out
so they they play completely different
in the beginning than they do at the end
it's supposed to be the same sport but
it doesn't even play the Same by the end
of the match
so with pickleball you're using this
little hard plastic Wiffle ball that's
exactly the same
from beginning to end and
if you didn't want to you would never
have to buy another one you could have
one you could have one ball and last you
the rest of your life if you didn't lose
it
and so and then the other thing they did
is that because it's a wiffle ball when
it bounces somebody can hear that hit it
at you pretty pretty fast but when it
bounces it slows down immediately and
just sets up nicely so you can hit it
again exactly where you expect it to be
a regular tennis ball doesn't even
bounce the word to the place you expect
it that's the hardest thing about
playing
right is the ball doesn't bounce the way
you expect every time it's different but
the pickleball will bounce the same
every time the other thing they did is
that you don't have to run very much
so if you were playing somebody
competitively you'd probably get a good
workout because you know you keep the
ball in play for a long time that's the
beauty of it and you would probably have
plenty of writing but you could also
play doubles with your grandfather
and your grandfather could play
Pickleball just fine because there's not
much moving it doubles so somebody
actually somebody actually invented a
game that's perfect for this part of
society
a 12 year old could pick it up and play
with a 70 year old and they'd both be
fine
it's got a 15-minute learning curve
just think of that what sport has a
15-minute learning curve from never
played to oh I can do this pretty well
I can do this as well as you can 15
minutes
soccer soccer would be great if they
shortened the field
got rid of out of bounds which you do
with indoor soccer
short in the field fewer people six on
six indoors
now that's a good game that is a great
game Outdoors some people can play
all right
um
you might be aware that I've been
mocking uh fired Twitter employees
uh
because I think it's funny because the
the funny thing about it is that when
Elon Musk was firing people at Twitter
um he was firing them in many cases they
had too many people that was the big
problem but in many cases they were
let's say famously not hard workers
now I don't want to cast aspersions on
every employee obviously clearly some
were hard workers and maybe others were
less serious but I've been running the
series and Dilbert
this week where the a number of the
fired employees from Twitter have gotten
jobs at Dilbert's company
It's Kind of Perfect Isn't it
come on admit it that is a perfect
combination of headline with comic
all right so here's one of them so this
is the new Dilbert employee
from Twitter
and here's the joke the ex-twitter
employee now working for Dilbert's
company says that's not that's not how
we did it when I worked at Twitter then
dilber says maybe that's why Elon Musk
fired you
and then he says how long are you going
to use that on me and dilber says I'm
thinking three to five years
three to five years
that's all for that
have I ever told you that I planned 60
years in advance
let's actually literally true I planned
my whole life worked out largely the way
I planned it including being a famous
cartoonist which is weird I mean it was
that specific
but there's one other long-range plan
that I've had which I have talked about
publicly but not for a long time
it goes like this
I believed I was born at exactly the
right time in history
where if I could stay healthy into my
senior years
science would figure out how to stop
aging
I actually bet
that if I really really
worked on keeping myself healthy and you
know kept my weight and stuff under
control if I could reach approximately
my current age and still be healthy that
I could lock it in
for the rest of my life
do you think that's possible
do you think anything like that's going
to ever happen or you could just lock it
in
well
might be better than that
so here's a story this is a real thing
I'm not making this up
so in a Boston lab I guess there's some
let's see who's working on this
reversing aging but they they got a big
breakthrough we've heard we've heard
this before by the way you're all aware
that there have been breakthroughs and
aging before
none of them really sounded real to me
this is the first one that's ever
sounded real
and it's because of what they discovered
more than how they're doing it
right because I always thought to myself
can you really reverse aging because
there's the damage is already done right
but apparently
this is what some Boston researchers I
think at least one person's associated
with Harvard
um but they found out that
it's an information problem not a damage
problem
is it an information problem in other
words your body loses the information of
what what your DNA and you know your
genetic makeup is and once it loses the
information it doesn't know how to make
a new copy
here's what they discovered
there's a backup copy
no there's a backup copy
they found the backup copy
let me just I'm going to say that three
more times
it's so mind-blowing it's so
mind-blowing I just have to say it three
times just let just indulge me
they found the backup copy
they found the backup copy
did I mention they found the backup copy
[Laughter]
they figured out
yeah I don't think it's in the stem cell
necessarily I don't know the answer
where it was but they they could
actually uh they can take a mouse that's
old
and they can restore its eyesight
by making it younger
they can restore his muscles
they can restore its
brain
its brain
not only not only can they restore it
they've experimented going both
directions
they can make they can make the mouse
older
intentionally
and they can make it younger
intentionally
now what you what you're usually
thinking in these cases right is okay a
lot of stuff works on mice and even
though mice are you know 90 98 similar
DNA to humans that two percent is a
really big difference when it comes to
estimating what will happen there's a
reason you go from mice to monkeys to
humans you've got a testimo the mice
aren't going to tell it but
suppose it's true
that in humans as well
it's an information problem
and there's a backup copy
because that appears to be the case with
the mice
it's just an information problem they
found the backup copy
if they do that with humans
there there's I hate to say it's common
sense because common sense is totally
magical thinking and confirmation bias
but it seems to me
that if it's an information problem
and this is a big leap I know
there's a greater likelihood it would
work in humans without bad effect
does that make sense
it's not like they're introducing a
chemical necessarily that's you know
changing the nature of your DNA or
something if the only thing they do is
find the backup copy and you know
restore it
I wonder
who we might actually be able to change
aging
do you know that big problem of the
demographic bubble
it's going to get worse but maybe better
because you maybe you take a bunch of 70
year olds and you say oh no if we make
you all live to a hundred
we're not going to have enough money to
survive
but instead you say hey
you're 75 years old you used to be
retired but now we're going to make you
feel like you're 25 years old if you
want to go back to work then people say
oh okay I feel good I'll go back to work
but the the way that things could play
out in the next 50 years are so
unpredictable if you add AI
and immortality
and robots
and space travel
how do you predict anything
there's literally nothing you could
predict anymore
all right uh there's a company called
I've I wrote about this in my book loser
think it was a company called climb
Works c-l-i-m-e climb works all one word
and they they're in production now with
a uh a carbon
um sucking machine
so it sucks carbon out of the air and
they store it Underground
now what is the first thing you'd say
about a thing like that
couldn't possibly be cost effective
right it takes a whole bunch of energy
you know that's a bad thing to me so you
gotta use a lot of energy to suck it out
of the sky but there's no way it can be
economical
they found a way to make it economical
that's a big deal and the way they did
it is they uh
that there are such things as carbon
credits and there are big companies that
can't reach their carbon let's say Goals
so a company like Microsoft will say oh
damn you know we can't really be
Microsoft and not meet our
climate change goals right that's just
too politically
employee-wise it just is a bad look so
Microsoft will go to a company like this
and say what's it going to cost me
to pay you some money
to remove some carbon that I can claim
because I paid the money so you don't
have to do it yourself you can just be
the one that causes it to happen and get
some kind of carbon credit
so Microsoft goes to them and says
what's it cost to remove a bunch of
carbon so I can meet my goals and they
they give them a price and then what
does Microsoft say holy what
you're going to charge that much
that's insane that's like that's like a
hundred times more than I think it's
worth
and then what do they do then they pay
it
then they pay it because they don't have
another choice because not meeting their
climate goals would just be so terrible
and Microsoft is so big
that they can overpay by a hundred times
on some you know smaller part of their
their financial statement and it still
makes sense because they're not really
buying a better climate they're buying
um reputation
and so this company allows you to buy
reputation
at the same time you might be doing
something good for the climate
they actually solve the economics
do you know what a big deal that is is
it's almost incalculable
in terms of what a big deal that could
be
yeah it could make you know
it could make it completely practical
to do this technology now you remember I
think this is still in place but didn't
Elon Musk offer some kind of X prize for
whoever comes up with the best carbon
capture
um technology
so this company is using the technology
probably at least part since 2009.
that's when they started around then so
they've been in business for a long time
and it takes a long time to build the
assets so they're probably just guessing
five to ten years behind the technology
curve because because at some point you
just have to build what is available you
can't wait forever it takes a few years
to build it so you're always you're
always behind technology by the time
you're done
yeah no I I see the comments I
understand that it's ESG
but
um
the the carbon credit part if that's if
that's the only part and big company is
just buy their way out of it
it might turn into something good
good
now you could argue that there's no
reason to do it and they'll suck all the
carbon into the air and all your plants
will die
but I feel like I feel like the Adam's
law of slow-moving disasters
is working perfectly for climate change
because one of two things is going to
happen we're thinking to find out it was
never real
and totally possible
no I'm still going to call well I still
want to kill ESG but I don't think you
need ESG to have a climate objective
I think the companies just do that on
their own at this point because it looks
good I don't think they need ESG to be
driving it so I think you can separate
those two things
all right
um here is the least surprising news
item you'll ever hear
ABC is reporting that climate change is
causing heart attacks
can can you all join me
in the long sarcastic sigh
because sometimes words
don't really capture what you're
thinking right
I I'd like to lead you all in alongside
about ABC reporting that climate change
is causing heart attacks at this time at
this very interesting time
of course they are
of course they are
but here's the interesting thing
they might have data to back it
apparently it's a thing
apparently it's a thing so they they
believe they found correlation
between excess Heat
and at athletes dying suddenly from
heart attacks
turns out they claim
that the athletes killing over with
heart attacks are far more likely to
happen in these unusually hot places
do you believe that
that's a little hard to believe
but
um I would like to refer to you
to the Cheryl law of restaurants
the Cheryl law of restaurants
is that as soon as anything changes in
the environment people stop going to the
restaurant for a while
so if so if it gets really warm outside
like the weather is really nice
for a few weeks people stop going to
restaurants
if it rains
people stop going to restaurants until
it stops
if it's tax day
people stop going to restaurants
basically anything that changes makes
people stop their behavior and what
happens when people change their
behavior
stress
right so it's also a thing
that whenever there's any big change in
society that's you know disruptive to us
mentally as well as physically people
have more heart attacks basically
everything that's a big change
causes heart attacks and so one expert I
told you about already said that the
pandemic itself and the lockdowns
should create a lot of heart attacks
it's exactly what you should say a lot
of unexplained heart attacks so
I'm not going to be the one that tells
you that
the vaccinations are completely safe
because nobody ever thought that even
even people in favor of it knew that
there was risk involved for some people
for sure
so
it does even to me and you know I'm
trying to remain skeptical as long as
possible it does look to me like the
myocarditis is not entirely
environmentally caused
can we agree
it sure doesn't look like it
does everybody agree with that statement
you know we could all be surprised by
data being misleading
but it sure looks like something's going
on so I agree with you on how it feels
and I agree with how it looks
now what happens when somebody like Lisa
Marie Presley dies unfortunately yet
51.
what was she 54 she was early 50s right
and she died of a heart attack
now she also had a history 54 years old
okay she also had a history of drugs
and if you see any picture of her she
does not look like you know a healthy
person
so if you're going to pick somebody that
heart attack
you know and she'd be on your short list
I think even even that even at her age
so of course we all will jump to
conclusions about what killed her I'm
sure it was climate change
just kidding all right
um
oh it's like believe it or not it's also
true that pharmaceutical medicines can
work differently in high heat
I think it's true or at least it's
reported let's let's assume that
everything could be sketchy so we won't
if it was true but they actually have
some indication
maybe short of proof but they have some
indication that a medication that was
really good for you
will kill you above a certain
temperature Outdoors
if you're active I guess not not if you
just walk Outdoors but
I don't know does that sound true
I don't know maybe
I saw a tweet by uh Antonio guterres
who claims that the past eight years
were the warmest on record globally
and you know therefore blah blah blah
now what is left out of that
well I'm not sure because I don't
believe anything about data and
temperature but I just saw a claim the
other day that 2022 set no records
could they both be true
could it be true the 2022 set no weather
records
while at the same time the past eight
years were the warmest on record
globally
because that is a record
so we've got one person saying no
records were set
and other ones say yep we just set a
record
for the the eight hottest years
yeah
both could
be true-ish
could be true-ish but you see the
problem right now
um there's a class of people on Twitter
who really really like to argue the
technical factual accuracy of statements
that really should not be analyzed for
exact technical accuracy this is one of
them right if you're nickel and diming
me about the words or really talking
about two different things I get it I
get it they were talking about two
slightly different things but it is
nonetheless true
that you either set a record you didn't
you know that's kind of binary
but here's my larger point
can you trust anything
on records and weather
I don't think so
um let me do something that confuses the
clot Birds I'm going to say something
that sounds like I'm disagreeing with my
own
let's say team
because I I I I roughly identify with a
group of people who have similar similar
opinions so now I'm going to uh I'm
going to criticize an argument by my own
team
here's the worst
skeptical argument about climate
this is the worst one
it used to be warmer
and there used to be more CO2
which are different points because
because the points are they used to be
warmer at lower CO2 and there used to be
more CO2 at lower temperatures so if you
look back in history
you know you can see that uh what we're
claiming today doesn't make sense
um
the Nickelback theory of deaths all
right
um
so here's why those arguments are the
worst all right yeah I'm not talking
about the last 20 years
if you're talking about if you're
debating the last 20 years that that's
probably fair but if you go back to like
the early days of the planet
and you say well in the early days of
the planet
we had way more CO2 does everybody know
why that argument doesn't make sense
are you all aware of why that's a
debunked argument
because if you go back far enough
uh there were other things that were
different
for example the intensity of the sun was
different the composition of the
atmosphere was different so if you go
back
far enough
it doesn't matter what the CO2 was that
doesn't tell you anything because
everything else was different
does that make sense if everything was
the same
except for the CO2 then that might tell
you something
but if everything was different in the
past including CO2 then there's nothing
about the CO2 that tells you anything
too many too many variables and that's
that's the case yeah the sun the sun was
different different intensity just
everything was different
however if you want to make the argument
that the um the alarmists have been
wrong for 50 years
Daniel says incorrect no Daniel the word
incorrect means that you're incorrect
and the word wrong means that you're
wrong
because if I if I were wrong you'd give
me a reason
wouldn't you I think you would yeah yeah
there were difference in that many
plants there were all kinds of
differences
so if you're going to use the past to
make your argument
I'd use the last 50 years but I wouldn't
use thousands of years ago that's a bad
argument
does anybody anybody agree
because you can still be super skeptical
on climate change but don't use the
historical you know middle the uh what
do we use the Dark Ages and just
ignore all that and I I don't really
believe we can tell the temperature
even 50 years ago frankly you know Tony
Heller is back on uh on Twitter
does everybody remember Tony Heller he's
the most prolific uh data skeptic about
climate change now he goes after the
data he says this data is incorrect and
he gives his reasons now I spent a lot
of time interacting with his material
and I came to the following conclusion
I don't know if you know I can't judge
all of it
but there were enough things there that
were clearly wrong
in my subjective opinion that I
discounted everything else he said
because unfortunately even if you're
right about a bunch of stuff
if you also say a bunch of stuff that is
clearly not true
then I discount all the rest but it
doesn't mean it's not true
I mean I have a feeling he's got some
good points in there it's just you can't
tell which ones because some of them
clearly don't look true to me just yeah
you can just almost tell what's wrong
with them by looking at them
now he does a lot of analysis on a lot
of different things is there any chance
he could be right about any of it or I'm
sorry is there any chance he could be
right about all of it because he makes a
lot of claims not really there's nobody
who could be right about a lot of claims
on sketchy data nobody could do that is
he right about some of it being a lie or
misleading almost certainly true
some of it I just don't know if it's
important
but what's interesting is that he was
completely suppressed by the platforms
when he's not suppressed that he's back
on Twitter quite active he does move the
he moves the ball
he actually changes the whole argument
in my opinion because he always presents
graphics and and data he always shows
his work
and what have I told you about a
documentary
all documentaries are persuasive even if
they're lies they're really persuasive
because you don't see the other side
when Tony Heller does his presentations
they are super persuasive
persuasion wise he's a champion he's
really persuasive
but what he isn't necessarily is
credible enough
that I could accept is more you know his
more extreme claims
but he's really interesting I'm kind of
glad he's back frankly I I like the fact
that he makes everybody answer answer to
his claims and and you should also know
that there are people who make a job of
debunking him and do a good job
so if you were to look just Google his
name and Google the word debunk which is
a good thing to do by the way you're
going to see a lot of his claims
allegedly debunked but can you believe
the debunker
what do you think can you believe the
debunker no matter who it is doesn't
matter who it is can you believe him
no no
because they only show one side
everybody who's just say one side you
don't believe any of them their their
Advocates now if the debunker said
and I don't believe this has ever
happened but if the debunker said you
know I gotta admit
40 of the things he says they check out
but you know be careful because sixty
percent doesn't
I would believe that debunker
I would immediately say oh that's the
first credible person I've heard because
they're saying some true some not
that feels like a fair analysis because
there's no way he's wrong about
everything
right
and he produces a lot of content he's
not wrong about everything
that that would be almost impossible
because you know he puts a lot of
intellectual rigor in it whether it's
right or wrong
so
yeah anyway
um if we can't predict uh
here's my point
I don't believe we can even agree what
the weather was recently
true or false
we have trouble agreeing what the
weather was even recently
how the hell are we going to predict the
weather in 80 years
that who predicted that climb Works
would find a model that works who
predicted that Elon Musk would offer an
X prize for carbon capture
I mean there's just so much that's going
to be different
all right
um
so what about those gas ovens I there's
a whole bunch of confusion about whether
the Democrats really wanted to take away
your gas oven or did they really want to
just ban the future ones or was it all
made up I can't even tell I'm not even
sure it matters but
is it perfect
that they're actually gaslighting us
that's a little too perfect isn't it
it's literally
gas light
I mean it's less about the light but
it's more about the gas
and it's just too weird
that it's the it's just built into the
name there
um
all right
so
I guess our gas ovens might be uh
killing us and uh and of course climate
change might be killing us but not those
vaccinations damn it
that you call Jabs
couldn't be that couldn't be that
let me ask you a question
regardless of how much damage is or is
not done by the Jabs
themselves
would you agree with the following
statement
there is a mass hysteria going on right
now about the side effects of the Jabs
even if it's true
like even if some of the data is
alarming and true wouldn't you say that
there's a mass hysteria at the same time
I've seen more yes than those because
because it could be true at its base
but also blown up into something a
little bit bigger than that
to me it looks like
at the very least it's a massive stereo
so I'm going to say the one thing that I
am sure of at this point
is there's some percentage of it is mass
hysteria because that's what gets you to
talk about I mean Lisa Marie Presley
was not a healthy looking person
not healthy looking and she had
the history of drug abuse
you know if you see that one and you see
the football player and your anecdotes
which actually might be it might be
exactly what you think they are
I'm not I'm not eliminating that I just
think it's obvious at this point we've
also reached a Hysteria
even if there's something at the base of
it and at this point I'm leaning toward
yes
in case you're wondering
um I'm leaning toward they're just yeah
the signals are so big and the Pharma
companies appear to have been lying to
us
now I heard I heard a hypothesis from
uh
Dyson who's the what's the name of the
uh
astrophysicist
Dyson
what's his first name he's got like a
three name name
give me his name
Neil
Neil Dyson deal Freeman Dyson
okay
I always get his name wrong
um
Neil Degrassi
Tyson Neil Degrassi all right sorry I
apologize to Neil for
um what's your username
so you have a theory that I thought I
heard on the podcast that goes like this
do you remember when the uh the claim
was that the vaccinations were like a
hundred percent effective in stopping
the spread
you all remember that right it's hard to
forget
is that it turned out
not even close
closer to zero yeah in time now here was
his explanation that I'd not heard
before
and I'm not gonna and for the clot Birds
I'm going to describe what he said which
is different from me agreeing with it
you get that
but I'd never heard this explanation
and the explanation was that when Alpha
was essentially the the primary thing
they were looking at it might be true
that the original uh the original
vaccination it might be true
that if the only thing out there was
Alpha it might have actually stopped the
transmission and that might be what they
tested
but since it since the virus was
mutating quickly
the the vaccination has to be sort of
perfect for the virus because a virus
will mutate out of you know away from
the vaccine so quickly that's it's as if
there was no immunity at all
so could both of those things be true
that in a weird little
technical very temporary time in space
it was a hundred percent effective
but within minutes it was Zero effective
I'm going to say minutes just to make
the point true
because because I do think if they knew
exactly what the virus was they could
make a vaccine
so that's the fact check
could you make a vaccine for this if the
virus never mutated I think the answer
is yes
I think the answer is yes and I believe
the reason that
um
the researchers said they'd never be
able to make a vaccine is because the
mutation
I don't believe ever anybody ever said
if this virus never changes we can't
make a vaccination
because I think if it never changes they
can
so
I'm not making a claim
um it's more of a question
but could that explain
why why the Pharma companies were
claiming it was 100 as effective because
remember it wasn't just the Pharma
companies you know there's other people
involved and they were making the same
claim
so
here's what I think here's here's my
current assumption
would you agree with the following
statement that the Pharma companies were
using motivated analysis
in other words that analysis analyze all
this data but they were motivated
by their own objectives and so they kind
of saw what they wanted to see
and even if they knew they should have
looked around the corner
they didn't
it looks like it motivated an analysis
right now when I say motivated that
still leaves some wiggle room about
whether there was intent
so I'm not saying I'm not saying there
was illegal intent there might have been
I wouldn't rule it out because so much
money was involved there might have been
evil intent but
there there is there is a thin
explanation
that doesn't require anybody to have
evil intention and my problem with this
all along is that so many people were
involved it would be hard to imagine
they all had Financial intention
but they all had motivated reasoning
they all hadn't motivated recently
they wanted it to work they wanted to be
heroes they wanted to report it worked
and everybody wanted the pandemic to end
so I think it was just wishful thinking
that blinded them to the obvious fact
that they should have mentioned the
moment this thing mutates the virus the
vaccine won't work so
all of these people by not telling us
directly
this is what they all should have said
in retrospect right hindsight hindsight
makes us all brilliant but in hindsight
you wish they had said our Test shows it
really worked on Alpha but we don't
think Alpha is going to last long
what do you think
I think that's what they should have
said
because everybody who worked on these
respiratory viruses I believe every one
of them knew that if it if if it mutated
the vaccine wouldn't work they were just
hoping it would
they were sort of hoping
that if it didn't if it didn't mutate
too fast
and it didn't mutate too much
you might be able to you know get some
purchase on it but that was motivated
thinking
there was nothing to suggest that that
was going to happen that was just like
optimism or something I know so for sure
we know that they told us things that
were not true
for sure we know that they meaning
Pharma and the governments
told us things that they should have
known they should have known were not
true
that's where the crime is
if if there is a crime that's where it
would be would you agree or do you or do
you believe that they all knew and they
were just playing it for the money like
hundreds of thousands of researchers
were all in on it
there probably were a lot of people in
on it but I don't think all of them
um my assumption that they knew it would
mutate
100 of the people that I heard
ever talk about it said that all of them
they all do they all knew because
they've been trying for years to make a
vaccine and the reason it didn't work
it was always the same reason because it
mutated right they all knew that
everybody in the business knew it we
didn't know it maybe
I think even I do that
Thomas Massey makes a good point as he
often does
um
so you know you can't sue a vaccine
maker because they have special
protection
so if a company makes a vaccine
can't sue him if it goes wrong
but what if they tell you they're making
a vaccine
and it doesn't stop any transmission
and they probably knew it
is that a vaccine
I'd say no
and so therefore I'd say
if it's not a vaccine then you can sue
them
you can sue them twice once for saying
it's a vaccine when it's not
and once because if somebody got harmed
and they didn't have full information
but the CDC apparently evolved their
definition of a vaccine
during the process
so if you were a vaccine you couldn't be
sued
but then they made something that wasn't
protective of transmission and the
definition said protective of
transmission
so they changed the definition
to match what it was doing which was
protecting people from Bad outcomes
and then what if it didn't do that
I'm not sure that's the case but what if
it didn't
so I think Thomas Massey has a real good
argument that I would love to see
taken to the Supreme Court
if if you're if it's only legal because
it's a vaccine by a definition and then
somebody that you're colluding with yes
colluding with the CDC if the people
you're colluding with change the
definition so you stay legal
is that cool
is that cool
I don't think so I think I want to see
the Supreme Court work that out it's not
obvious to me if that's necessarily
illegal
it's sketchy as all hell
but I'd like to see well yeah I don't
know if lying is always illegal though
yeah by the time the vax arrived the the
original screen was already dying out
that is correct
um
I would like to uh reiterate something I
say once in a while but it's important
again
uh I put this under the category of
youthful dumbassery
was anyone smart when they were young
was anybody a genius until they were 25
and then they turned dumb
like I don't think so
so why do we judge people by what they
said in college
so there's another uh situation and I'm
not going to name a name
the reason I'm not going to name a name
there's somebody who's getting some
trouble for something they said at
college is that I don't think it's fair
so don't even Google it
do me a favor if you're like Curious who
are you talking about who is this right
don't even Google it because we should
not be judging people by what they did
in college
you know unless it's Greta right because
she was in college when she was doing it
uh or she was that age
so without naming who it was there's
some some other person who said
something super inappropriate
that may or may not have been in an
academic you know making a point kind of
context but it doesn't matter just
whatever they said under the age of 25
just let it go
if people never improved
then yes you should judge them by what
they said in college but if you know
that a hundred percent of people who are
something close to it
evolved
you know we evolve into something
different might be better it might be
worse but is it different
so why would you judge somebody today by
what a different person did you know
somebody whose brain wasn't developed
anyway I like to say that once a while
now there's been a lot of negativity in
the news and I thought today especially
because it's Friday the 13th you needed
some positivity
would anybody like some positivity
because it's all this negative stuff
yeah yeah you need some
so I made a little list I tweeted out
earlier of
some positivity
so on one hand the covid Jabs are looks
like they're going to be super
overpriced
super overpriced in in the context of we
already have inflation
and then these shut these Jabs are going
to go to like you know 400 percent what
they used to be Etc
um but on the plus side apparently you
don't need them
so it doesn't really matter what it
costs
if you don't need it
now I'm I'm not giving you medical
advice you're not going to add medical
advice from me I'm not telling you not
to take it I'm just saying it's
literally true that the price is going
up 400 percent at the time that the
utility is down about a thousand percent
so if the price is going up as the
usefulness is dropping like a rock
I don't know that that's entirely bad
news I don't care what it costs because
I'm never going to get it
back down
I I like to ask you coach let me ask I'm
going to talk to coach here coach
uh what I like to do is base my
decisions on the knowledge that I have
and then if if the data changes or we
learn more
sometimes I will modify my opinion to
fit the new data which refuted my old
opinion
now I know that you call that
flip-flopping and backpedaling and
walking it back
but I'm a little bit curious how you
play it
when you have an opinion and then the
information is updated to show that your
original opinion makes you look like a
monkey
do you say to yourself you know I was
pretty comfortable with looking like a
monkey
I think I'll I think I'll ride that
horse
monkey horse got too many metaphors in
there but do you keep your opinion just
the same
or do you say
and and I'm I'll bet you do this coach I
feel like you're this kind of person I
think you're the kind of person who can
go into a fog of War where none of the
data
is reliable and you can have certainty
from the first moment
and then based on that certainty it
really wouldn't matter how much the
information changed you could keep that
same opinion
because you are certain even when there
was no information
so is that coach is that how you play
because you know there are a lot of us
who are playing at the dumb old way
where if the data changes we'll update
our opinions but not you
no no you've got a progressive
kind of a
clubber kind of opinion where the change
in the data should not have any
difference to your opinion
yeah you could it's cheating now
somebody says yeah it's cheating to to
update your opinion with new information
I hate to do that all right here are
some uh more positivity
if you have a son who's a little bit too
rambunctious
in the old days what could you do about
it
nothing
I mean I guess in the old old days you
could like use corporal punishment
but you know you can't do that anymore
so what can you do if you had a
rambunctious son there's nothing you do
but now
on the plus side you can legally remove
their balls
oh I'm no doctor but I think that calms
them down
that'll settle you down a little bit now
you can't remove their balls
um unless they want it want you to right
even though they're children they still
get a vote so you can't really go to
your son and say hey I was thinking of
removing your balls and transitioning
you to a woman because it'd be easier
for me
um
now the kid might say whoa whoa whoa I'm
totally a boy and I have no interest
whatsoever in transitioning but here's
the good part
children can be hypnotized really easily
that it's a real thing when you learn to
be hypnotist one of the things you learn
is children you don't even have to work
at it
you you could say two sentences and make
a kid hallucinate is very easy
so you can convince your child
of really anything children sort of a
blank slate you can just work on them so
if you're if your son is two round bucks
yes uh even though it would be totally
unethical
um you could probably convince them to
have his balls removed if he worked at
it long enough so that's the good news
um here's some more good news things
could be much worse
things could be much worse for example
you could live in Canada
I mean
it could be worse could be worse
number four again in the context of
inflation
wouldn't you like to know that some
prices are coming down and they are and
they are for example Fentanyl
um because of supply and demand the
supply is through the roof
so the price of fentanyl totally
reasonable and nobody nobody talks about
that
that's good for inflation
I don't think when they calculate the
inflation they include the price of
fentanyl if they did I think they look a
lot better look a lot better
um
bad news here's some more good news do
you remember when bad news used to be
all there was on the news
like if there was something bad
happening you turn on the news you're
like oh it's like a fire hose all this
bad news coming at me but now
fully 50 of all the bad political news
is suppressed
lesson upgrade you only have to hear
half of the bad news
it's all about Republicans but all of
the bad news about Democrats
suppressed you never have to see it and
that feels good that's like a
it's better than that Andrew huberman
breathing technique it just makes you
feel good
um
and then of course
some of you were worried about
some of our national Secrets getting out
because you're about Mar-A-Lago
yeah Mar-A-Lago maybe maybe those
National Secrets might get out so but
um these days much better situation
so we don't have Mar-A-Lago now we have
Cara Lago Cara Lago that was Jesse
Waters joke was pretty good
um Cara Lago and
our nation's secrets are safe in the
bins next to Joe's Corvette in his
garage
so that's a lot of good news and people
don't report the good news and I feel
that
that's uh that's good now
um do you think that the headlines are
all organic or do you think that we're
always being played
what do you think do you think our
headlines are organic
or are we always being played
you're always being played yeah that
because
the headlines could be anything
the headlines about any politician could
be positive or negative it could be
anything so whoever chooses the
headlines
you know they're
they're presenting a narrative
interestingly
here's a pro-vaccine story but not about
covet not about covet
so the Wall Street Journal has a
pro-vaccine story about the HPV vaccine
which they say has been a big part of
dropping U.S cancer mortality by by a
pretty you know big amount like down by
a third or something
and
it's because uh the vaccine
do you see it
let me ask you this
would there have been a pro-vaccine
story
if we were not questioning the
vaccinations about covid
isn't it interesting that to be this
totally unrelated story that just it
just happens to highlight the magical
abilities of vaccinations
at just the time the public is starting
to question the value of the coveted
vaccinations huh The Wall Street Journal
has a nice pro-vaccination story
just a coincidence
Maybe
maybe but maybe not maybe not yeah it's
plausible that it's a coincidence that
is plausible but in today's environment
it's a little harder to assume that
that's the case right
um
but I'm glad cancers down
um there's been a special special
counsel has been exit named
to look into the
the news that Joe Biden has a bunch of
a bunch of several cases of confidential
information two for sure maybe some
third one
and so they got a special counsel to
look into that my biggest problem with
the special counsel is I don't know this
person's pronouns
and it's a little confusing because the
person's name is Robert or her
spelled h-u-r
I think his pronouns are him and her
h-u-r
that's the way I'd go
I'd go with
my pronouns are him and her
yeah that's how I'd go but we don't know
um
and I also asked myself if uh Robert or
her
married Dean Kane's sister I don't know
if he has a sister and I don't know if
her last name would be Kane if she's
single but it's funny just go with this
uh and they hyphenated the names of the
kids they would be uh uh hurricane
hurricane
and I wondered what would be the the
funniest first name to go with a with a
last name of hurricane
I was thinking Wendy
Wendy
how's that hurricane well it's pretty
windy it's pretty windy out there now
hurricane
yeah or how about uh
imma yeah I'm I'm a hurricane yeah
killer storm is stormy stormy hurricane
there you go Stormy Daniels
stormy hurricane
Camille
yeah okay Kansas I don't think Betsy's
that why do people say Betsy is that
funny
herder further
all right well Robert Herr is going to
look into it
um and so that should take care of her
right the good news is that an objective
person has been put in charge so that we
can what
he's not
what
oh according to cash Patel Robert Herr
is a quote swamp monster who was
involved with uh
the Russia collusion hoax
literally
the worst person in the world
to be in charge of this the worst person
okay
now the left says that this person was
appointed by Trump
isn't this sort of normal to have lower
level people approved by a President
and the president has no idea who they
are they could be the other party I mean
it's lower level people it doesn't
matter does it isn't it common for
people to get nominated who are not
necessarily your same party so I don't
think that means anything
but it does look like this fixes in and
he looks like he'll be the fixer for
this
do you remember I was telling you that
it looks like the Democrats are trying
to take Biden out with this document
thing do you remember me saying that
and I even put hashtag conspiracy theory
because when I said it I thought okay I
know I'm I'm going a little too far here
so I called it out as my own conspiracy
theory and then I turned out in Tucker
Carlson and he says it directly
he just says it directly
um
so it does look like the Democrats are
trying to take Biden out it actually
does look like that now that doesn't
mean it's true
but that hypothesis fits everything we
see
the other hypothesis is it's just
business as normal so you have the other
possibility
um
but I asked this question can documents
be fingerprinted
because wouldn't you want to know who's
touched those confidential documents
wouldn't you like to know and doesn't
that make a a big difference
what if you see Hunter's fingerprints on
them
that's a problem
do you think Hunter's fingerprints will
be on any of those documents
I know there was a reason that they were
not where they were supposed to be
maybe it's an accident
maybe not we'll see but but here's what
I would look for
if they do not fingerprint the documents
the fix is in
what can you agree on that if they don't
to fingerprint the documents then you
can know for sure that it's just a
cover-up operation
if they do fingerprint them you can
still wonder if they told you the truth
but if they do fingerprint them and they
find you know Hunters fingerprints on
them then I'd be willing you know just
as one example it could be someone else
but
I'd be willing to say oh that looks like
they might actually be serious about
this
which would also suggest the Democrats
are out to get rid of Biden
here's my take on Biden I think that
Biden was helped
into his election by lots of powerful
people behind the scenes
and then he came to believe that the job
was his and it was totally up to him
whether he runs for re-election
so he said yeah gotta run for
re-election
I don't believe that the people who
installed him are necessarily on the
same team and I think they might need to
take him out
because he's an old man who just claims
he should stay
so
um
you have you noticed that even CNN is
creating this is CNN is treating the uh
Biden documents
like it's as important as Mar-A-Lago
and it's the top story
it's actually their top story
an
anti-democrat story
CNN's top story
does that mean that CNN has successfully
you know pivoted to the middle at least
on this story
or does it mean that where the signal is
that the Democrats need to get rid of
Biden
it doesn't mean they had a meeting and
they colluded it could be just
everybody's on the same page so they all
know what to do
yeah it does it's a little bit
suspicious
I would expect CNN to do a whole bunch
more of minimizing it
and they're not they're actually
maximizing it
so it does look like the fix is in
but not necessarily
all right there's not much to be said
about the fact that the documents were
in a garage park next to a car
and we can make all the jokes about how
secure that was it wasn't whatever
um
here's a story that's
might be fake
but it might be fake and also tell us
something
so I'm going to say the odds of this
being true or low but the odds of it
meeting something important or very high
and what I saw was just one social media
account uh so it's not it's not in the
regular news
so at the moment the regular news is not
reporting this so it might not be true
but there are Wagner soldiers who
videotaped what they claim are captured
Ukrainian drones that are clearly
outfitted for chemical warfare
meaning they have tanks on them that
obviously are meant to hold a chemical
or a gas they wouldn't have any other
reason to be there and there's a bunch
of them it's like a room full of drones
small ones that have been modified to
carry some kind of a gas canister
now the Wagner group claims you know
that they've been used
now here's the thing
do you believe the Wagner group no no no
you shouldn't leave anything that comes
out of Ukraine but here's the only thing
I wonder
were the drones real
do you think they faked it by making a
whole room full of drones that have
canisters attached because that would be
a lot of a lot of work if you were good
if you were planning to fake it
how many do you need
you only need one
you literally just need one because it
would be just as convincing as a roomful
because if you saw one and you believed
it was real you'd think there were more
you know you would never believe there
was only one so if it were fake they
only need to show you one
now
I believe it is fake but maybe not for
the reasons
that the drones are not real it could be
fake in the sense that it's Wagner's own
drones
it could be that the Wagner group is the
one with making the gas drones and since
they're definitely going to get caught
what they did was say oh look at these
ukrainians so if you ever see one
the first time you ever find one on the
you know that crashed you're going to
say oh the Wagner group warned us about
this these are those Ukrainian drones
so this could be the Wagner group
getting in front of the story they know
is going to break the sooner or later
somebody's going to find a drone with a
canister on it
and so they're making the case that it's
the other guys before it happens
that's what it looks like
but there's a bigger question
if those drones are real
and again I don't know why you would
have so many of them if you're going to
fake it you don't need that many it
would be a weird way to fake it
if those are real that's what's coming
and you know my book the religion War
written in 2003 I think predicted this
and it's predicted based on the
following
technology predictions
the drones would be widespread and and
hobby sized that you know regular people
could get a drone that could do a lot of
stuff so that I predicted in 2003 that
came true the other thing I predicted
is that because the Drone won't be able
to carry a lot of weight
it's going to want to use weapons that
don't weigh much
and the Ultimate Weapon that doesn't
weigh much
is gas
so it almost it's almost guaranteed that
somebody is going to use these for you
know crop dusting their enemies
so it's coming you know whether these
are real or not it's definitely coming
[Applause]
and what do you think would be our
response if if our homeland were
attacked by chemical weapons and drones
unless they happened more than once it
looked like there was nothing we could
do to stop it what would we do
what would the United States do if we
knew the drones were coming from a
specific country
and and they just kept coming
and imagine what that would do to our
cities
like people wouldn't go Outdoors they'd
stop commuting I mean it would just
wreak havoc
there's only one thing we would do we
would pay for that country
and that's what my book was about we
will in all likelihood
there will be drones that terrorists use
with chemical weapons in all likelihood
and if they do it more than once and it
becomes like a pattern
we won't be able to find the specific
terrorists probably
we're going to just take out the whole
country
and we
we just might not have any other choice
because we wouldn't be able to live with
it
and we would do whatever it took and it
would be genocide
it would be pure genocide
so that's why that's the setup in the
book the book is what happens when
genocide is the only solution
what happens when it's the only solution
I hate to use that word solution because
that you know for obvious reasons
but
do you think that that's likely
do you think it's likely that they'll
that kind of uh weapon will come to our
Shores in in numbers and is it likely
that we would respond in any other way
than just eliminating buildings in the
country we would just make sure
everybody had to live outdoors
I think we just eliminated
yeah we get it
yeah we get it
um is it genocide if it's self-defense
yeah it would be because it would be
genocide against
99.9999 innocent people
depends on the president I don't think
so
see that that's the hard part I don't
think it depends who's in charge because
they'll only have one choice eventually
that's not woke
send in those robot soldiers
all right that's enough for today
I'm gonna go do something else I think
you'd agree
this is the best live stream you've seen
so far today and it's only going to get
better
and remember
everything that you've been told is
backwards including Friday the 13th it's
a good luck day it's a good luck day
go out and get yourself some good luck
and bye for now YouTube I'm going to
talk to the subscribers for a little bit
on locals because they're special
bye for now
