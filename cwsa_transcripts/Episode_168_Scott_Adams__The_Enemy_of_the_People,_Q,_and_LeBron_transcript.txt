Hey Kevin Hey Morgan
Gino come on in I see Gino is using the
says structure of his uh his name there
I'm not sure if I started
that all right uh you may have noticed
that it is an
extraordinarily slow new news
time we need more news we're used to a
higher threshold of the fire hose of
news but what we really
need yeah it's a simultaneous zip and
it's coming it's coming at you coming at
you hard or as uh Chris Cuomo says let's
get on it or get after it or something
he has a saying but that doesn't matter
now
how about the simultaneous
hip that's good
stuff so let's talk about Q uh I waited
into the Q
conversation had no
idea that it was going to become a thing
I thought it was just another one of my
opinions but this one seems to have
taken some legs and so as a public
service I thought I would reveal the
truth of
q but it didn't seem right to just say
it so instead I put it in the form of a
puzzle which I tweeted you can find it
in my tweet stream and you can see some
people responding to it um you can see
that people
have people have penetrated it the the
top two
layers so it's a puzzle that has three
layers two of them have been
penetrated the third one's the hard
one you're going to have to find out
what three things have in
common that is not
obvious and once you find it you'll know
the
truth if you don't find it you might
think well is this it or is that it so
here's my uh here's here's my
hint when if you figure out the solution
to my puzzle you will know the truth of
Q at least the essential
truth and you'll know you have it right
if you don't have it right you still
might think you did but you won't be
positive you'll still have some doubt if
you have some doubt you don't have the
right answer cuz when you get the right
answer answer you'll know you
haven't all right so I thought it was
more fun to put it in the form of a
puzzle uh oh and by the way just to make
you fun I'm never going to tell you what
the answer to the puzzle
is but it is there and it is solvable so
I'll promise you it's solvable and I'll
promise you that if you solve it you
will have the actual
truth about q but I'm never going to
tell you if you soled it
correctly all right let's talk about how
CNN is reporting about
Melania the headline is the
contradictions in Trump's White House
and the subheadline says Melania Trump's
split with her husband over LeBron James
is the most glaring example of a growing
Trend but then you read the article
about her split with her
husband and basically she just said good
things about what LeBron is doing with
his
school is that really a split with her
husband or is that just being
diplomatic sounds a lot more like being
diplomatic so that feels like a a lot of
nothing and then there was uh the
headlines of Michael Jordan taking sides
with
LeBron well that's true he said he has
LeBron's back basically but he didn't
say anything about President Trump why
because Michael Jordan's
smart he he split the difference
perfectly he supported his friend but he
did not come out against the president
in any explicit way that could be quoted
or taken out of context too easily so I
thought more evidence
that U Michael Jordan is
smart I saw that Facebook has removed
four pages from Infowars and Alex
Jones I don't know what that's all about
yet but you should be worried about that
I haven't seen the details
yet um I'm seeing a lot of people I'm
just jumping around today I'm seeing a
lot of people talking about the Don Jr
meeting and somebody on the internet was
tweeting was it Ben roads um tweeted
that that getting information from a
foreign
National is a bad thing that was the uh
the essence of it
now I and I tweeted back that
Christopher steel was a foreign
National now I got pushed back from that
comparing Christopher steel who is not
from this country and and put together
information that would affect our
election uh compared to this Russian law
laer who alleged to have information but
didn't have any and the distinction that
I got is oh oh wait you can't compare
them because one is allegedly working
for Putin and the other one is allegedly
working for you know first maybe a
republican then you know with the FBI
and then the campaign and so there was a
little bit of no no those aren't those
aren't real because Christopher steel
was sort of working for
us to which I
say how in the world does that
matter yeah he's still foreign how does
it matter that somebody was paying him
and the person paying him was from this
country I don't see how that matters
he's still a foreign National providing
information that affects a campaign and
if we pay him to do one thing and he
provides information that does whatever
he wants or his country
wants I know so my take on this is
they're either both illegal or both
legal obviously I'm not a lawyer so wait
for dtz to tell you what's legal and
what isn't um you want to hear a weird
dtz
coincidence as I'm flying to meet
president
Trump uh last week I'm on the plane and
it's a it's a jet blue and it's got the
TV and I'm watching TV watching the news
and Ellen dwood comes on with another
pundit I forget who it was and both of
them started talking about buying their
suits at Men's
Warehouse and I literally just bought my
suit at Men's Warehouse and I always say
I'll do whatever Alan dtz
does and and and I'm flying for my
meeting with my Men's Warehouse suit
listening to Alan dersa would say he
buys his suits at Men's Warehouse which
is the most random thing to say on
television
yeah it came from the conversation of
Mana for's ostrich suit and then the two
of them said yeah we use Men's Warehouse
and there I was
um I don't know if my new suit impressed
anybody but it was the only suit I had
after I bought it so I didn't I didn't
own a
suit so there you
go um just looking at the rest of the
news LeBron James now we already talked
about him did I cover
everything it's such a slow news day is
there anything else you guys want to
hear
about so I I've been watching the Q
supporters evolve in their belief it
feels to me that only yeah I'll talk
about Candace good suggestion uh it
wasn't long
ago that people were saying Q is
definitely true and you you will find
out and I'm seeing a lot of Q supporters
today say something along these
lines saying that uh it doesn't matter
if Q is real it helped us organize to
understand what the Deep state is up
to so you may see some people changing
their views of
what of what uh Q is all about so I just
saw a video just before I got on of
Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens who
apparently were just trying to eat at a
restaurant and some group of antifa
protester types I don't know if they're
antifa but their protester types are
following them around with a bullhorn
and bells and they're making noise and
calling them
racists now a bunch of white people
calling Candice Owens a racist is
probably the funniest thing you'll ever
see um
and it's hard to imagine that that's a
that's a good
thing people say a q is a good thing not
a bad thing because I see your
comments
um
because because why because is it is
educating you on all the things that may
or may not be
true
um oh yes let me refer to my polls so I
did a Twitter poll yesterday and as you
know Twitter polls are not
scientific so um the following is not
presented as any kind of scientific poll
but I did a informal little Twitter poll
on the question of um what did people
think of black lives matter and the KKK
and I said do you think KKK is racist
only but black lives matters not do you
think black lives matter is racist but
KKK is not I didn't expect anybody to
say yes to that do you think they're
both racist do you think neither of them
are racist and the last I checked I
think it was 90% of respondents said
both black lives matter and KKK are
racist organizations which is different
from saying that all the members are
racists all right I don't believe
anybody thinks that's the
case um well I'm sorry the KKK are of
course already racists because that's
the point of their organization but I
don't believe anybody thinks all of
black lives matter are racist the
question was about the
organization so and again this is not a
scientific proof it's not my opinion I
just wanted to see what the poll would
come up with and I was not surprised to
see that um yeah it was a both sides
poll uh I was not surprised to see that
uh
Republicans and Trump supporters
primarily think that both sides are
racist now you know what that
means what is the biggest complaint
about Republicans biggest complaint
about Republicans is that they are
racists now the black lives matter are
against one racist group the KKK here
I'm simplifying of course they're
against all racists but simplifying
whereas the Republicans according to my
poll are against two racist groups in
their view both the KKK and black lives
matter so if you don't
understand and this is an important
point I think conservatives and
Republicans understand themselves for
the most
part I don't think that any side
understands the other side just as a
general
rule but if you're on the left and you
don't understand the Republicans are
wait for it
twice as against they're twice as much
Against Racism as the left if you don't
understand that you don't understand
anything about the right you shouldn't
even be in a political conversation if
you don't understand that basic thing
the left are looking at a small Universe
the KKK which I believe I saw somebody
said 3,000 people in the whole in the
whole uh country
black lives matter and the people who
support it is probably a bigger number
and um it seems to me that the people on
the
right um disavow the racism from all of
the KKK they disavow all of the KKK
supporters and they go further they
disavow black lives matter members who
they would consider racist and they
disil the group for being uh a racist
group again I'm just reporting I'm not
giving you my opinion on this topic
um so you know that you you've seen me
have some conversations with Hawke
Newsome
and you can see where the the disconnect
is where there's a an enormous
difference of opinion the Trump
supporters are against all of the racism
KKK is just a small part of it but
certainly they're 100% against that as a
as a group and they're also 100% against
or or 90% it looks like against any
other racist group whether it's black
lives matter in their opinion or anybody
else
um now I've only got a few more
minutes he doesn't accept
Charlottesville I don't know who you're
talking about
sick of the racist
rhetoric I hear what you're saying I'm
tired of it
too all
right
um I'm just looking at your
comments I'm I'm already seeing Oh I'm
glad I saw that making notes of all bad
arguments because I'm writing a book
that needs
those and one of the bad arguments is
you're making a moral
equivalence so somebody's somebody is
objecting that I would makeing moral
equivalence between KKK and black lives
matter but I'm not that's just dumb
thinking you know I'm not making any
kind of moral equivalence I'm just
saying that both are organized around a
racist ideology according to the people
who answered the poll um
so I think it's important to know that
the people on the right are against
every form of racism whether it's a KKK
brand which is totally different from
the black lives mankind so nobody's
saying it's the same thing nobody is
going to suggest that you could find a
million ways they're different I'm just
saying that people dislike both of them
for a similar reason which is racism is
bad but certainly completely different
forms uh alleged in this these
cases
um um somebody's thanking me for
clarifying you're welcome
yeah I heard what was the uh the murder
rate in
Chicago 40 listen to this in Chicago
this is a headline 44 people were shot
in 14 hours in
Chicago uh I hear a question about Bill
P and the answer is you're going to hear
some uh real real interesting
stuff pretty um coming up not today very
soon
um all let's
see all right if anybody um manages to
solve my
Q quiz I'll be looking at it not a quiz
a puzzle um it seemed like only a
appropriate to put it in the form of a
puzzle because the people who follow Q
are very
smart so let let me say this um as a as
a general statement that I think is true
the people following Q are probably
unusually smart IQ
wise uh I've told you many times that IQ
doesn't protect you in any way from you
know the illusions of life being smart
doesn't help you from cognitive distance
having a high IQ doesn't help you with
confirmation
bias so the the followers of Q can be
very smart IQ wise and I think that's
probably true I would guess you know if
you were actually just major IQs are
probably above normal um but that is
completely irrelevant to whether they
have the right impression of what's
going on IQ doesn't help you in cases
like this
so some of you may think that you have
solved my puzzle but I haven't seen a
solution yet I've seen people penetrate
the top two layers the second layer if
you want to know what the second layer
is count the number of letters in my
tweets but there's another layer and
it's the hard part and the hard part is
trying to figure
out what the what the first part of the
Tweet uh what what what the pattern is
in terms of what the people mentioned in
the first part of the Tweet have in
common that ordinary people do not have
in common so if you're thinking oh
they're all people or they're all smart
or they're all you know male if you're
thinking like that it's nothing like
that there's something
unusual about the three
entities and if you figure out what the
unusual thing is that would be unusual
for any normal citizen but they all all
three have in common you will solve the
puzzle all right that's all for now and
I will talk to you all later
