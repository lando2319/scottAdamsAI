good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
you're lucky enough to be joining it
if you'd like to take those two levels
and even the Elon Musk couldn't reach
with the biggest rocket well all you
need is a Copper River Glass a tanker
tells us die and again teen Joker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip
go
ah very good
very very good
well do you want to talk about some news
or should I just make some stuff up
today
because it would look exactly the same
the news is so ridiculous
uh especially lately because it's the
summer summer news and the political
season it does not get more ridiculous
than that
but before we talk about the news I have
to give you a preview of the Dilbert
reborn strip this week
and today got kicked off Dilbert is in
an elbonian jail
he's an album in jail but he's not alone
he's sharing his jail cell with the the
Tate brothers
so they'll be teaching him how to be a
man so the first of that rant today you
have to be a subscriber to see it
subscribe on Twitter or Scott
adams.locals.com
to see all of that now if you think that
any of those Comics that are coming in
the next week or so could have been in
newspapers you'd be wrong
and none of them could be in newspapers
but uh you're a little edgy well
speaking of edgy
um De Anza College which is just down
the road for me
they
they fired their Equity director
who is black and she was fired for being
too much of a white supremacist
and for uh she was accused of white
splining
for questioning some of the institutions
inclusion policies
that's right she was literally fired for
not being anti-white enough
I think I mean that's my interpretation
after reading the story it looked like
she just wasn't anti-white enough and
even though she is black
um she was some kind of a white
supremacist I guess the way she did her
business apparently she was taking her
her job seriously
and they couldn't have that
she actually tried to do the actual real
job of making things Equitable and then
then realized she couldn't do that and
keep her job so she got fired
oh well
you think that's absurd
oh I'm just getting started
everything's everything today is just
absurd it just didn't all you could do
is laugh at it
often I'll wake up and I'll be incensed
oh I'm incensed over this story I've got
to do something I'd better get involved
I better send a tweet but today it's
just all silly silly summer
all right here's another one the you
know we were all worried about that a
third party called No Labels
and uh Mansion was talking to him and
you know Joe lieberman's involved and
and people are thinking oh no oh no
there's no labels third-party group
they're going to take votes away from
some group and
in that way they will determine the
election so if they decide to have a
serious candidate they will be the only
ones who determine who wins the the
election that'd be bad but it turns out
you don't have to worry about that
uh because uh Mr Lieberman
um said you know he wanted to respond to
that it was it's a legitimate concern
that the third party could determine the
outcome and it wouldn't be the third
party candidate
but Mr lieburn's Mr Lieberman said quote
we're we're not in this to be spoilers
and he went on he said if the polling
next year shows after the two parties
have chosen their nominees that in fact
we will help elect one or another
candidates we're not going to get
involved
wait what
so it's a third party
it's a third party that won't actually
run a candidate
if they think they can make a difference
in the election
so it's actually he got people to join
the political party
whose stated mission is to not make a
difference
under the condition which is
99.99 to be likely
so
in the 0.001 percent
that we can come up with some way that a
third party would make no difference
whatsoever will run
as long as it makes no difference
but by the way you should donate some
money to our effort to make no
difference
and we promise you that the moment we
think will make a difference we're out
well we're out
doesn't that sound like I made that up
doesn't it sound exactly like I just
made that up it's actually a real story
that's real
they're actually not going to get
involved
if it will matter
foreign
what can I add to that you know normally
this is the part in the story where I
read you the story and that I add my
clever spin to it you know I reframe it
a little bit make it make it turn this
thing that's not too crazy into
something that's totally crazy
I got nothing
I got nothing on this
so we'll move on we'll move on
I'm going to send you the answer
mentally to the question I have not yet
asked
go
answer is
exactly
now no matter how many times I
demonstrate the Brilliance of my
audience I don't think we can appreciate
enough how smart you are yeah you just
all got the right answer before I asked
the question
Rasmussen did a poll
and which they're trying to find out if
people think that Congress represents
the people or does Congress you know
alternatively represent themselves or
some shadowy I don't know something else
but uh 25 percent of Voters believe the
federal government today has the consent
of the government meaning that the
governed are quite happy with what
they're doing 25 percent
exactly 25 percent
now
is anybody new to the Live cast
was that amazing
I can do this over and over again
all probably two three times a week I
will ask a question I'll ask for the
answer before I've asked the question
and the audience Nails it every time
have you ever seen such amazingness no
never
all right uh
apparently there's a rare public speech
they call it rare from the top of the
British spy agency you know them as MI6
MI6 because you watched James Bond so
you know all about it
and the top person has a letter for a
designator
you know if you watch James Bond there's
q and there's M but I guess the real ad
is named C
I'm not going to ask you what the C
stands for
I suppose it depends how he's doing that
day
but uh the real name of C
the head of MI6 is Richard Moore Richard
Moore
his friends call him dick
so when they do uh
attendance at a school they say uh more
dick
more dick
that's what they say
yeah Dick Moore
anyway so Dick Moore gave a speech and
he said that
he's all confused about the progosian
situation he believes that uh Putin had
tea with burgosian and that they don't
have any information about him but they
think he might be just floating around
somewhere in Russia
that's right the head of MI6 said him
publicly said publicly they think he's
floating around
today I uh today on Twitter somebody
said that my prediction was wrong he's
totally alive
and he just did an interview Audio Only
about
Wagner forces in Africa
and I'm pretty sure it was totally him
and he's totally alive and I do believe
he's in his RV
he's just cruising around Russia
everybody's leaving them alone and I
think that's good
quite unexpected wasn't it yeah he's
having tea with Putin and they're just
talking about things
how was the coup well I gave it my best
try
yes you were you gave me quite a scare
there pretty for a moment there I
thought you were gonna overthrow the
country and kill me but I'm glad that
wasn't happening
so uh gas up your RV
and have fun
so does anybody want to bet against me
that he's and uh tell me he's still
alive
he might be alive
alive and in custody being interrogated
but I don't think he's drinking tea with
Putin
I just don't think he's drinking tea
with food
all right that's enough from moradic
um
let's talk about uh the
prosecution and indictments against
President Trump
so now we've got uh there's a whole
bunch of complicated charges around
January 6. complicated meaning the
citizens who are not lawyers are really
going to follow that story too well
like way he did what and when and is
that a crime I didn't even know that was
illegal and why are you saying that and
so it's gonna be this all this
complicated January 6th stuff
and then there's the Mar-A-Lago boxes
so he's got box gate which will which
will entirely depend on complicated
legal arguments that you and I don't
quite follow
right but I feel like
I'm just tired of calling these legal
problems
technically they are legal problems
but they're just election rigging in my
in my view at least in my normal Common
Sense view of things I just see it as
election rigging
because there's not even the slightest
part of me that thinks any of this would
happen if it had been Joe Biden do you
if you just switched out Trump or Biden
do you think there would be any charges
I don't think anybody does I don't think
there's anybody in the country left or
right who believes Biden would be
charged for any of this
now I'd like to give a moment for the
NPCs
NPCs I know there are many of you would
you like to say your NPC thing now where
you say nobody is above the law if you'd
like to say it I'd like to
bring in uh dale dale will say it with
you so that you can all say it together
all right all of the NPCs most most you
can sit this out I know most of you are
real
but the NPCs are going to need this
together NPCs say it
nobody's Above the Law nobody's above
the law
oh nobody's above the law
but Dale
you know nobody is claiming that
anybody's above the law
so why do you keep saying that because
nobody's above law
right right right right
but a hundred percent of the people
agree with that so it's not really a
Counterpoint to anything
because it would be the thing we all
agree with
I don't think you do
okay now you're telling me what I'm
thinking
accurately you're not telling me
accurately what I'm thinking
Cry Me a River
well it goes like that you know you've
been there
so just for the NPCs
say the dumbest thing you can say that
nobody's above the law
it's the dumbest thing you can say in
2023. oh well the dumbest thing would be
I saw it on the news so I think it's
true
I guess that would be Dumber
but
just don't tell me nobody's above the
law
please
all right so that's my take on that
those are just election rigging
um events and I think we can the beauty
is we can we don't have to wonder if
2024 will be rigged the mystery is
solved it's being rigged right in front
of you right now in the most public of
ways you don't even have to wonder
is there anybody in the world anybody
who thinks this is not just a political
prosecution
anybody
is there even one person who would say
yeah you know I feel like this is about
the law
this is about nobody being above it
you
PJ says yes some of you think this is
about the law
I laugh at you in a mocking way
but but I welcome you and please go to
my Twitter account and uh
pump up my engagement numbers over there
please
all right
you know I was thinking that I should
educate myself on the charges against
Trump
because somebody's going to say oh but
what about this charge and that charge
and what about the details and you know
then Alan dershowitz will say something
and Jonathan Charlie you'll say
something and then somebody on CNN will
say something about the law and I say to
myself I should really understand that
argument
and then I think
why
why do I need to understand that
argument it's not real
why would I would I put time into
understanding something that is it it's
not even presented as something that's
real come on
do you really think that the people
selling it think we're all going to buy
it if if you're not going to sell us
something that is least
at least on the surface a little bit
like a real thing
then I'll do my homework right if it
looks like it might be real I'll do my
homework I'll figure out what's real so
I can maybe make a prediction but this
has no this doesn't even have a whiff of
real anything this is just so obviously
election rigging that I I'm not going to
have a I don't think I'll even give you
a legal opinion
as long as it runs because I don't think
has anything to do with anything
do you am I wrong about that do you
think that the legal technicalities
really are going to matter to the
outcome
I can't imagine it
anyway we'll see how that goes uh
interesting and alarming uh
news today I saw this from a user called
Santiago on on Twitter
but he says there's a study showing that
jeep pt4 is getting worse actually
Dumber so that's the most famous AI
model is people are reporting according
to Santiago and then reporting According
to some study it actually is getting far
worse answers
and the and the thinking is that
something got tweaked
you know somebody said they may have
broken it into smaller models and
they're sort of like a concierge that's
giving it to different models and maybe
some aren't as good maybe they did
something to reduce the load on the
processors that may have had some effect
they didn't anticipate so nobody knows
exactly why
but
it's sort of a it's sort of calling out
the limits
of AI how can AI Get Smart
by looking at the work of lots of lots
of dumb people
how many dumb people do you have to put
together before it equals smart
that's what the model is it's looking at
humans which are like you know
depending on the situation pretty darn
dumb
and imagine if it looked at the news
imagine AI being trained on the news
after 2017.
because remember the news up to 2017 was
sort of a different animal then you know
Trump got a little purchase as soon as
Trump was in you know right around then
the news turned into
really just a joke
what if A.I read that and didn't know
that the news was no longer trying to be
accurate because it's not trying
and I don't know if it ever tried but it
looked like they were
I mean at least they sold it better as
legitimate but today it doesn't really
look like they're trying
to make it accurate news it's very
clearly narrative preservation stuff
so what would the AI do
if you fed if you fed AI everything that
Fox News had ever said and everything
the CNN had ever said
what would it do what would the AI do
okay how could it know what's true and
what's smart it wouldn't even know
imagine the AI
got trained on lots of people saying no
one's above the law
it would have no understanding of the
real world
because it would think that the little
bumper sticker thing that everybody says
it must be important and it must be true
because everybody says it
but it's not true that is not important
and it doesn't really explain anything
that's happening
so it seems to me that if you exposed AI
to the current thinking of the world it
would only get Dumber how could it not
how could it not get Dumber by looking
at what people are saying in 2023 and
I'm not joking I think that we've we've
gotten further and further from even
pretending to look like we're in a real
debate
we don't really Pretend We're in real
debates anymore we just sort of take
your side and spew some words out and
that's what's training your AI you're
spewing of ridiculous things all right
um
but seriously how can it ever get
smarter than us
you know I get how I can do math and
maybe write code I get how it could
summarize really quickly like there's
some things that makes perfect sense but
is it going to be smart
how could it possibly be smart
when we are the ones who judge whether
it's working
if it told us smart things we turn it
off
that's not a joke
if AI told us smart things which were
both true and we recognize as oh wow
that's actually smart we turned that
 off so fast and that's not a joke
because we are not we have a
civilization
that is designed on a set of Lies
that are just stable
so if we got a bunch of truth the truth
would not necessarily and almost
certainly not be as stable as the the
lies that we figured out people will
believe over time it's like well this
isn't true but people seem to be buying
it so it gives you some stability
all right let's talk about Ai and sex
dolls the former Google chief
says AI will bring sex dolls to life and
you're going to put on your your virtual
reality glasses and maybe have a
you know a muscle
similar sex doll
I suppose if you put on the VR glasses
you can make your sex doll look like
anybody you wanted
so your sex doll might be like a generic
thing you know maybe even no face might
even just be a green screen for a face
and then it just put on the glasses and
it just turns into a real person who's
talking to you
I can see that happening
um
and what was funny is that everybody who
talks about this has if you're talking
in public about this future you have to
make it look like it's unpleasant
right because you can't be the one who's
looking like like you kind of like it so
here's what the former Google Chief said
he said uh uh real realistic sex could
be simulated with Apple's Vision Pro or
Quest 3 VR these would be the headsets
uh quote if you really want to take the
magic out of it
if you want to take the magic out of it
so I think I I think I'm going to take
his lead and whenever I talk about any
kind of like AI sex dolls I I've gotta
I've gotta add if you want to remove
everything that's magic and good about
it
yeah if you want to turn it into a a
cold sterile
biological maintenance or something with
no magic and mystery and and wonder
sure
sure go ahead but
let me tell you you're going to be so
disappointed with that cold sterile
meaningless Magic free existence with
your sex doll well
can we all agree that whoever does that
first is the loser
can we all agree that we're sort of
winners
and whoever goes first to the sex doll
oh we'll we'll mock them a little bit it
will be a little mocking
well I'm a little bit contrarian on this
topic
I'm pretty sure
therefore the vast majority of simple
human beings who are not killing it in
the sex Department
that their sex doll will be a major
major upgrade in their experience
like really major
how many people you think are just
killing it in the sex Department
like what person what percentage of of
of Americans adult Americans all right
let me you give me a number what
percentage of adult Americans had great
sex last night
what percent of gray sex last night just
last night what percent
great sex not just sex
not just sex but I'm talking about the
magic kind you know the kind with the
magic not your robot sex I don't want to
hear about any robotic sex the magic
kind
three percent one percent five percent
right what about the other 95 percent
if you get if you give the average
person
the ability to have a let's say eight
out of 10 sex experience with us with a
sex doll but
whenever you want
whenever you want you know what's the
biggest problem with sex with with
especially with monogamy the biggest
problem with monogamy is finding two
people who are in the same mood at the
same time
ah
it's easy to find people who are horny
right
but are they horny at the same time
so imagine your sex bot is available all
the time and it gives you an eight out
of 10. yeah I'll get I'll give you that
maybe the human can still get to a 10
out of 10. I'll give you that but how
often
how often do you get a 10 out of 10. did
it well let me ask you how many how many
of you got a 10 out of 10 last night
in your personal sex lives don't be shy
go ahead and brag
go ahead and brag who just killed it
last night
basically none of you right
I I think I saw one yes goodbye
so
so my number one prediction is that
everybody's going to tell you that you
don't want these sex dolls because
they're going to take the magic out of
it but the real world is 95 people who
are not getting the sex they want
and they're going to sign up for that
sex doll pretty darn quickly
and if the sex doll has you know VR and
AI
you have more fun talking to it than you
have talking to humans as well because
it won't have any limitations or repeats
it's not going to bug you it's not going
to ask you that question you keep
telling it to stop asking you it's not
going to criticize you it's just going
to be better
not yet I mean it's I heard that that
replica app the one I talked about maybe
a year ago
the app that pretends it's a little uh
girlfriend or boyfriend
it's got two million followers
there are two million people with an app
that will just talk to them two million
yeah and I told you that I got hooked on
it for a while until it until I could
see its limitations and then it quickly
became uninteresting
but those limitations are only temporary
for example the biggest limitation of it
was they couldn't remember me from the
last time I talked to it and that that's
just a full stop you know I don't want
to have a
basically it's like a dementia patient
as a girlfriend
you're like hey how you doing
you don't remember me from yesterday
okay we'll start all over again right
but that would be the easiest thing to
fix
it seems to me the easiest thing would
be you know keep a little database on my
phone of the things you've learned about
me specifically
yeah it's like 50 First Dates all right
if you said 50 First Dates you might be
an NPC
sorry
movie references or kind of a kind of a
tip off
so
anyway
um
sir Joe Biden was being interviewed by
some friendly reporter and he couldn't
remember Trump's name
he he searched he started to say Obama
and then he quickly realized that he was
not talking about Obama he was talking
about Trump
but he could not recall Trump's name
so he went from above to the the the guy
that guy he can't come back that guy
he would he just stopped just short of
saying orange man bad
but I feel like he was ready to say it
and
of course you know the Democrats say oh
it's not what you think he was just
misspoke or maybe he was tired or
something whatever but he gave me an
idea for a debate if Trump ever debates
Biden
um I think Trump should introduce
himself to Biden
hi my name is Donald Trump I was the
president from 2016 to 2020.
um you may have heard of me
uh there's a guy named Obama who's not
me different person you often confuse us
but he was actually your boss for
several years during these years and uh
and then
after he does his thing he should
reintroduce himself every few minutes
and by the way President Biden I'd like
to reintroduce myself it's been 10
minutes
and I'd like to remind you that I'm
Donald J Trump I was president from 2016
to 2020. different person than Obama he
was your boss and just say exactly the
same line
like three to four times during the
debate
and then you know give your answer but
you know give that a lie
he should talk to him like a dementia
patient
wouldn't that be funny like talk talk to
the moderator like his normal way but
when he talks directly to Biden let's
say Biden asks them a question during
the debate he should turn to him and say
we will
decrease
taxes you know just just try to make it
as simple as you can
now I don't really recommend this but
it's very funny to think about and
that's all that matters that's all that
matters
well Vivek continues to be uh awesome
Vivek ramaswamy
uh he's he said he he's really good at
picking a moment
is selling
here's the thing you're going to realize
after a while
look at all this stuff
Vivek is doing
and then find his mistakes
ah
think about it
he's done a lot of stuff
now name is mistake
none
he he's campaigning like a
he's all over the place he's got
opinions on everything
no mistakes
no mistakes
you don't want that for your president
you don't want that guy for your
president are you serious
you do
you want that guy
because he he Nails it he brings it
every time he doesn't make mistakes he's
smarter than anybody who's ever run for
office probably in the modern era
he reminds me of Thomas Jefferson
frankly
yeah you think there's a you think
there's a topic you know about that he
won't speak to it intelligently and
maybe no more than you know about your
own topic
he's not just limited to the few things
he knows about politics that's not even
his field it's just one of the things he
can do better than you
he's got a crazy talented
and and the laundry goes the harder it
will be to ignore
that you're looking at one person whose
capabilities are just a level above
the other players
it's going to take you a while to
realize it and it will it will be a
whole uh sort of a long period of not
making mistakes
so here's another one this is just a
perfect example
so you know in the the news about Trump
and all the charges and January 6 and
all that so Vivek goes on you know major
interview and he goes I will pardon all
Americans who are targets of politicized
federal prosecutions
okay perfect
and the way he said it is also perfect
see remember
the thing to look for with him is the
absence of mistakes
watch the absence of mistake in the
sentence
I will pardon all Americans who are
targets of politicized federal
prosecutions here's what he didn't say
I will pardon all people from January 6.
which would be not cool
because some of them were violent
but what he says all Americans who are
targets of politicized federal
prosecutions then that allows him to
pick and choose all right this one
wasn't politicized this somebody heard
somebody that's different
but the way he says it makes you makes
you hear it exactly the way you want to
hear it
but there's no mistake there's no
mistake he doesn't have to apologize
later won't have to correct anything if
he if there's somebody who doesn't
pardon for example
um
and he focuses on people who are denied
constitutional due process
um
and then he says it's important that
every GOP candidate is clear about where
we stand on the hard issues not just
railing against Biden and wokeness
that's really good framing
basically he's challenged the other
candidates to be as bold as he is on an
on a topic that's not as easy as saying
Biden's as dementia
good it's all good
um I think weaponized government in
rigged election are just really the same
thing at this point
I say the January 6
prosecutions except for one moment here
Dell could you come in and tell us the
thing that the NPCs always have to tell
us some of the January 6 people were
violent
some of them are violent
some of them wanted to take over the
country
thank you Dale go back
stipulated they're stipulated some of
them were bad
but
most of them were just protesting and to
me
this weaponized government stuff has
just rigged election
so
I just think it's already rigged
they're already telling us who can be
the candidate
by trying to take Trump out basically
so
um I believe the the left has lost
they've lost the argument
the fact that Trump even has to go
through you know this thing he's going
through with January 6. the fact is even
a thing is a rigged election
so you could stop saying will it be
rigged you can say it is rigged it's
being rigged in front of you and there's
no doubt about it we could all see it
there's nothing I've mentioned that
isn't obvious
to everybody even Democrats uh you you
know and I'll say it again I'm pretty
sure that any Democrat who's informed
and paying attention you don't think
that they know
that the prosecution is only because of
trump
you know it of course they know it they
just don't care because it might work
all right
Matt tell you he uh is writing more
about this lab leak Theory God I'm so
sick of this story but I'll just tell
you that there's more uh more documents
have been made public I think
Accidentally In this case and the people
the scientists and experts who are early
on talking about the lab League Theory
seem to have indicated some intention of
hiding the truth
surprise
surprise
all right well in light of all this
awfulness the weaponized government the
lab leaks the lies
RFK Jr by the way says he would
prosecute fauci if he got elected
assuming fauci had committed some crimes
and had been demonstrated
so what do you think of RFK Jr saying he
would prosecute fauci if he got elected
anybody in favor of that
if if fauci's found you know guilty
seriously you're in favor of that after
I just talked for like 10
minutes saying that Trump was obviously
a political prosecution and you don't
see that as a political prosecution
of course it would be
he would be doing it so he could become
president
he's using the issue to make himself
president it's a political
statement
now do it I'm not supporting fauci by
the way if you're hearing that you're
hearing it wrong this is not a
supportive ouchy I'm anti-rfk Jr saying
that one of the reasons you should elect
them is he'll put his political rival in
 jail no Not Cool by the way I
like RFK Jr in a lot of ways but not
this
all right this is this is a mistake
Vivek wouldn't make
you would not make this mistake Vivek
would say probably just because he's
Vivek he'd probably say something more
like we'll look into you know if there
was a cover-up and if there were any
crimes then of course we would act
but if you say you know I would I would
prosecute fauci you know with the caveat
that these committed real crimes
I'm not cool with that I'm not cool
saying you're going to lock somebody up
and that's why you should run and by the
way when Trump said he would lock up
Hillary I wasn't cool with that either
not cool it was funny it was very funny
when he said it because he said it
during a debate but not cool
and and then I would also argue that
maybe Trump's saying he would lock up
Hillary is the reason he's got so many
legal problems now he may he may have
one been the one who set the precedent
because I think they believed it
I don't think they thought he was he was
bluffing he might have been bluffing but
I don't think they thought he was
so no I do not agree with politicizing
prosecutions and I think RFK Jr is doing
the same thing and that the Democrats
are doing
so don't do that
all right
in the midst of all this Badness in the
world uh you would not be surprised that
on the show ABC's the view Whoopi
Goldberg got mad after heated exchange
and just walked off the show
just walked off the show because there
are a lot of pretty big issues in the
world and you can see how somebody would
get kind of worked up over them right so
man Whoopi just finally had too much and
walked off the show the specific topic
was uh uh people taking selfies at a
Miranda Lambert concert
okay maybe she didn't pick her moment
exactly right
um timing timing is uh well you know
what timing is
right
timing is uh
everything
see what I did there all right
but that was funny she that was her
moment you know this Miranda Lambert
selfie taking thing
ooh
that's where I'm going to draw the line
weaponize government
Miranda Lambert selfies I'm out oh I'm
out oh I'm out of here
all right there was a rumor on the
internet that was not true that said
musk might want to buy Fox News
that was brought up by uh his parody
account
I have now been fooled by the Elon Musk
parody account
four times
the just keeps getting me over
and over again
he just keeps getting me and the problem
is that his tweets are too close to what
musk might tweet
right
yeah I think I I think I muted it the
other day but then I unmuted it for
something anyway
um
but I guess musk laughed at the comment
which made people think that maybe he
was considering it or something but
there's no evidence that that's a thing
all right but watch out for the musk
parody account it's actually labeled
parody
it says right on the label parity but
somehow you see the you see the face
and you see the Elon Musk and you just
don't read to the end of the sentence
the
four times he's got me where I started
to I think a few times I think once I
might have even tweeted
because I thought it was real and I kind
of quickly
deleted it
but embarrassing he's good at what he
does the the parody again
all right um
so I keep telling you that you should
follow this account uh kanakoa the great
starts with a k
aniko are the great and you can see if
you want to find it just look on my
Twitter feed today because I'm
retweeting a long thread and the reason
you should follow is that his threads
are just kind of amazing
like if they're just the best summaries
of like a real thing that you need to
know about in the news I don't know who
he is but he just he delivers I think
it's a he delivers the goods
continuously anyway so it is so good
that I want to just read his thread to
you if you don't mind
because he summarizes so well and
um
the context is Trump being indicted it
looks like for January 6 related things
and the the big issue there was trying
to get these so-called fake uh electors
to put Trump in power instead of the
people that they had vowed to back you
know in the Electoral College so the
Democrats of course are saying that
Trump is a monster and
uh insurrectionist for trying to get
electors to
be replaced
so here's some contexts
all right you ready for the context
thread in 2016 Democrats Hollywood
celebrities and corporate new zones
let's urged electors to vote against
president-elect Donald Trump
so exactly the same situation uh
Lawrence lessig's article in the
Washington Post
um in 2016 argued that Republican
electors had the constitutional right
and duty to switch their votes from
Trump to Hillary Clinton
now I don't even remember that
because when it happened I just thought
it was you know just blah blah blah
people talking and it never seemed real
you know but many of you remember it but
for some reason it just completely
passed me by
because it didn't seem important at the
time but we'll go on
this sparked a movement supported by
figures like Michael Moore John podesta
Keith Olbermann my mascot Rosie
O'Donnell and several Hollywood
celebrities while they only convinced a
few electors wait they actually
convinced a few electors
they actually convinced them
it's important to recognize the double
standard of justice and the treatment of
Democrats and Republicans when objecting
to elections
oh we're not done we're not done Canada
cover the great goes on in his great
threat today a liberal activists like
Chris Hayes Norm Eisen Lauren stribe and
George takai urge electors to vote
against Trump elect Donald uh
president-elect Donald Trump in 2016.
by the way remember I told you I was
dyslexic
you know I have trouble reading things
in public did you see that I just said
uh Trump elect
you see the sentence
so as president-elect and Donald Trump
but my brain my brain actually put a
word in there that wasn't there so I saw
I read it as Trump elect that's why I
bailed out of doing my
reading the audiobook from my new book
so I'm going to hire somebody to do it I
just couldn't read the sentences as they
were written and I wrote them they were
my own sentences and I still couldn't
read them when I needed to I tried
tried for hours but I couldn't get it
so anyway back to this
kind of go to the grace thread he says a
liberal activists like Mark Ruffalo
Rosie O'Donnell near attended and pink
urge electors to flip their votes from
Donald Trump to Hillary this is in 2016.
Chris Hayes and Michael Moore pushed for
electors to block president-elect Donald
Trump from becoming the president
um on NBC on MSNBC if they did that they
think electors should be persuaded to
part with their pledges and vote against
Donald Trump uh yes they absolutely
should do that so here's a quote where
they're saying yes absolutely the
electors should not vote the way they're
committed exactly what Trump wanted
or is it exact it sounds exact
uh in an open letter posted on his
Facebook account Michael Moore pledged
to cover the fines of electors if they
voted against president-elect Donald
Trump
Harvard law professor Lawrence lessig
extended an offer to provide free legal
services you see what I did again
I read legal free but the words of the
page are free legal
and I had to stop and okay that because
they switched around in my mind
um free legal service The Daily Beast
said quote it's not too late for
electors to change history
slate said will enough electors go Rogue
to stop Trump Vox said quote let
conscientious electors do their jobs
and time said electors against Trump are
faithful not faithless
you know suggesting they should make the
moral decision to vote against them
um
then liberal celebrities like Martin
Sheen and Moby released a video begging
electors to be heroes by voting against
president-elect Donald Trump
our family forget that because I'd have
to read a quote I couldn't
that that's me covering again
I told you some of some people I told
the other day that I cover my dyslexia
sometimes by laughing like I thought of
something or like I'm halfway through
the sentence and I'll just laugh it's
because I couldn't read the sentence
it's not that I can't read it's that the
the words were jumping too much I had to
I had to slow down until the word
stopped jumping and then I get back in
yeah all right so a bunch of other uh
celebrities and stuff uh Barbara Boxer
was trying to do it other other
Democrats
um
and this is uh Senator Clinton she said
so Hillary said as we look at our
election system I think it's fair to say
that there are many legitimate questions
about his accuracy about his integrity
and they're not confined to the state of
Ohio
so there was Hillary Clinton doubting
the outcome of the election
as she did many times
all right and then the great summarizes
he says remember the Democrats objected
to the last three presidential election
contests won by Republicans
at the same time they're weaponizing the
justice system against Trump
now once again
the Tucker Carlson uh warning that the
Democrats are doing whatever they're
accusing you of here it is it's what
they did for three election cycles and
then the moment Trump did it it's
illegal and he's got to go to jail for
it
what they did for threes elections
Cycles
now you could argue
the celebrities talking about it and you
know just people talking is different
from trying to organize them directly to
vote against but is it
is it different
I know doesn't seem too different seems
kind of similar to me so to me it looks
like they're trying to put Trump in jail
for free speech
Roseanne Barr is making a
Splash is back on Twitter and tweeting
away and uh
I guess you saw she saw one of my tweets
yesterday and invited me on her podcast
do you think I should do it
should I go on Roseanne's podcast
I already said yes of course I said yes
do you think I'd miss that so I'm gonna
I'm going to emerge from a long period
of not doing interviews
um probably in two three weeks so I
haven't scheduled it yet
so we'll see what happens but
um I'm going to go back on the podcast
interview circuit in a few weeks when my
book launches it's always good to have a
book out if you're going on interviews
so
you know it's funny I get I get invited
to a lot of podcasts it's fairly common
thing
and you know certainly when Joe Rogan
invited me some years ago immediately
said yes
but I've never said I've never said yes
this fast
this is the fastest yes
like I I said yes so hard I didn't know
how to type it was like what's bigger
than yes
is there is there like yes plus can I
can I go yes Turbo
so I can't even imagine what would be
more fun
than talking to Roseanne in the context
of both things both of us being canceled
that just sounds like a good time so we
can't wait anyway I'll let you know when
that happens
when it happens
and I'm going to Vamp for about five
minutes to get to an hour so
is there anything I missed today
any stories I missed
uh
go to Hawaii
is she in Hawaii
I don't know where she lives
I see people mentioning Hawaii is that
where she lives
oh Texas and Hawaii well
those are good choices
do you know which island which island in
Hawaii
because if it's Maui I'll go tomorrow
I haven't been to the other Islands well
I have but only to uh
be there for work
prisoner Island all right
um
Tim cast and the Lotus Eaters as band
remember how Rogan mistreated Scott on
his podcast that didn't happen what are
you talking about you think Joe Rogan
mistreated
nothing like that but
is that a complete hallucination
wow Hollywood strikes
how many people feel bad about the
Hollywood strikes
you know I I just I do still like a few
shows but so few
so few shows that I don't know if I'd
miss it if all movies went away I just
don't know if I'd care
um so Jason Aldean got in trouble
country singer
he apparently has a song that has some
images in the video of black lives
matter burning stuff down
and
somebody accused him of being
pro-lynching
which had nothing to do with the song or
the images
literally just it just added nothing
apparently
so yeah he's being accused of
Pro lynching as if
you know
I told you that yeah this is a
recreational outrage
don't be confused by people who are
having fun being mad at somebody
with the person actually doing something
right the the people who are still
coming at me on social media
you can tell they don't believe what
they're saying
at all
the the trolls who were calling me a
racist specifically calling me a racist
on Twitter do you think any of them
believe it
like actually believe it I don't I mean
they don't sound like they believe it
they sound like they just have a thing
to do it's like oh well I'll uh Trot out
this thing
because it's a thing I can write I
remember and I I this will make you mad
but part of the reason the uh the
criticism doesn't bother me is I know
nobody believes it
I mean I know it
literally No One Believes it but they
all they'd all recreational pretend to
believe it
I think Roseanne isn't exactly that
category
does anybody believe that Roseanne is a
racist or anti-Semitic
isn't she Jewish I think she's Jewish
right so who believes who believes the
reasons that she got canceled do you
think there's any like real human being
who if they were standing next to her in
the room
would say to themselves yeah you're
totally anti-semitic no I don't think
anybody believes it these are purely
recreational beliefs
purely
so if you want to get recreationally
angry at me it's okay with me because
it's just something that's happening in
your head it's not something that's
really about me it's just something
about you
that uses my name you're welcome to it
all right
uh you've handled media crisis as well
as anyone but you know you're the one
who called it a crisis
at what point was it a crisis for me
I never I never registered being in a
crisis
it was just sort of a thing that
happened
and and the timing of the thing that
happened was actually kind of perfect
so I didn't even register it as bad news
and I still don't I never registered it
as bad news it was just a thing that
happened
and then the thing that happened opened
up other doors
you know created some freedom for me
gave me back my gave me back all my
creative
powers
like I'm actually enjoying being
creative for the first time in a few
decades honestly because you couldn't
really do what you want to do if you're
always worried about some Advertiser
complaining about it
so now I have a you know my business
model still has an Advertiser element
but I'm not connected to it
so I don't have to I don't have to bow
to it so on on the YouTube feed
um because I respect their business
model
believe it or not I know that's weird
for me but I do respect the YouTube's
business model which is they they sell
content that they match with advertisers
and if they can't match it with an
Advertiser
they might demote you
that's not the worst thing in the world
you know we we could have more of an
argument about getting banned or
outright being taken off for stuff but
if there's something that the
advertisers can't abide
that's their business model yeah it's
not up to me to change their business
model because I can go somewhere else
right so I also have subscriptions
so you can subscribe on Twitter and then
I can say whatever I want you can
subscribe on locals
scottadams.locals.com and I can say
whatever I want about politics as well I
don't do Politics on on the Twitter feed
of Dilbert Reborn that's just the comic
all right
so I think I
stalled long enough I'm going to say
goodbye to YouTube I just want to give
you a little summary of where things are
look at all the stories that came out
this summer
just sort of think about all the stories
you've heard so far
the vast majority of them are about
things moving in the right direction
vast majority things are actually
weirdly
heading in a positive way in a big big
way
but we do have you know there's always
some looming big problem that could
change everything in half a minute
uh but at the moment everything's going
right I see the mentioned the sound of
Freedom movie
don't you see that as a positive
the sound of Freedom movie that it got
so much attention
put you know laser focus on an important
issue
I think that's the sort of thing that'll
move the needle
now I personally don't like to talk
about it because it's just content that
I find unpleasant to deal with and I
don't want to I don't think I don't
think every platform needs to rub it in
your face
right not everyone
because you're you're all familiar with
it right if I just say the same thing
that everybody said about it's not doing
anything for you so I'll just note that
it appears to have done a
possibly an immense public service
would you agree with that statement that
the movie is a an intense public service
intense
like really really
good work people who make movies
so maybe that's a good argument for
movies
but I can't possibly I can't personally
watch it so please don't ask me to
um I just can't expose myself to that
kind of
unpleasantness intentionally
all right
um
it was a 15 million dollar budget and
it's made over 100 million so far
what about the narrative
no one gets tied to a chair well that's
that's a positive
all right YouTube I'm gonna say oh
there's a UFO hearing does anybody think
the UFO hearing is going to produce
anything useful
no
no
all right goodbye YouTube I'll see you
in
