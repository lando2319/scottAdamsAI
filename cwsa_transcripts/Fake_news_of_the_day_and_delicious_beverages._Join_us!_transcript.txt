favorite part of the day
i just can't wait to see all of you
it's actually true
i don't have my my lighting optimized
today but i'm kind of liking this low
light situation i've got here makes it
more intimate don't you think
well for those of you who are obsessed
with my audio quality
on locals today i took the electronics
out
going directly into my ipad with the
lavalier
meanwhile on youtube i'm going through a
road caster
so you're getting different audio if you
like one of them well watch the one you
like
i don't know if there's any difference
really
but i'll know later
when i look at it
and if you'd like today to go up a level
get a little bit better i think you do
all you need is a couple of bug of glass
a tanker challenger science a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything better everything except my
lighting
it's called the simultaneous set but it
goes
like this go
well funny thing happened yesterday
people on locals already heard this
story because they're special
but yesterday i was threatening to throw
my hp printer on a window because i was
having some trouble with it
well it turns out that if you do a
popular live stream
and you threaten to throw a product out
the window
you will get a call from the people who
make that product
so i got a call from hewlett-packard
they have an executive
rapid response team for
exactly these
social media situations
and they asked me if there was anything
they could do
could they possibly uh help me get my
product running or
if there's something they could do to
maybe discourage me from throwing it
down a window on live stream which i
understand would be bad for business
bad for business
so
i'm not going to throw my hp printer out
the window and i will say
let me say for those who
sort of
were missing the fun part of this
hp is a great company
and they make really good products great
american company and i had already
ordered an upgraded hp printer so
every three years or so you have to get
rid of a printer they're mechanical
it's a mechanical device
it's not going to last forever
it was time to upgrade anyway so i've
got a new hp printer on the way
but
hp was on it
i gotta say when you see a big
corporation
uh
says we've been played no i actually did
plan to throw it out the window
if any of you were thinking
that i was bluffing about that
not at all
no i was actually i was only looking for
the right time of day and
you know i was trying to figure out how
to film it right everything i was
totally going to do it
just for fun
but i also didn't want to clean up all
the shards so that was part of it
anyway fake news of the day
news of the day
we got a lot of it today
new york post is reporting that there's
a
information coming out that new study
says babies born during covid
the pandemic have lower iqs
and not just a little bit
like really really lower iqs
now
true or fake news
the
explanation given is that uh it's not
biological rather it's uh
has to do with the situation
and the thinking
is that maybe the parents were all
frazzled and stressed
and staying home too much and there
wasn't enough stimulation for the kid
do you believe any of that
does any of that sound true
do you believe that babies
who were raised in the situation where
everybody's home
around the baby
that they get less stimulation
than if everybody's going to work and
you leave the baby with the
with the caretaker or
i don't know where
whoever takes care of the baby or if one
of you goes to work and one of you stays
home with a baby
that baby is smarter because there's
only one of you home
are you telling me that a baby with a
house full of people
is going to get less stimulation and be
less smart than a baby that stays home
with one person all day
i don't know
i would say at the very least
the explanation with which they
hypothesize
doesn't sound right to me
i mean just on the surface it doesn't
sound right and then i think some of you
are asking in the comments
how exactly do you measure the iq of a
newborn
can you even do that
how old does the baby have to be
before you can get a good read on its iq
yeah how do you measure that
now i imagine it's something like
you know does the baby you recognize a
sound or
you know does it turn toward a thing or
doesn't know that
the the toy is under the cup i don't
know
something like that
but uh i got real questions about the
accuracy of this study if it's true it's
the biggest news in the world
right
if this were true
it's the biggest news in the world
because this would indicate you can
totally manipulate the iq of your baby
by what's happening the first year
if that's true
we can turn all of our babies into super
babies
by figuring out what was different about
the pandemic and then you do more of the
stuff that's different from that
you got super babies and all the people
in other countries we're competing
against
well they'll just have normal babies and
their babies will never compete with our
super babies
but i'm going to say uh because it's not
the biggest story in the world that the
experts are
maybe not buying this
because if they were
i mean correct me if i'm wrong
if if our babies born during the
pandemic were really
noticeably dumber
we wouldn't be talking about anything
else
by far that would be the biggest problem
so apparently other people are not
buying this story but here it is
all right here's some more uh cnn fake
news
and this is fake news by intentional
lack of context
so there are lots of ways to fake the
news here's one of them
so adam dopamine found this and on
twitter and
this is cnn in a written written piece
uh they talked about alabama
hospital and says we're seeing
a lot of children
that are very very sick admitted to our
hospital
we have almost twice as many right now
as we did at the previous worst part of
the pandemic
it's pretty bad
and
so uh so how bad is that it's twice as
bad
what's
missing the number
what about the number
okay it's twice as bad
and
i don't know
do i care because if it was one person
last year and it's two people today
do i care that it's twice as bad
i kind of need a little context
well somebody else on twitter found
another local source
for
i think the same story
but local source said 33 children are
hospitalized in alabama with covet
33.
so let's say the number went from i
don't know they say almost twice
so let's say it's uh i don't know
15 extra children
so let's say
15 extra children
is that enough to change your national
policy
because of the 15 most of them won't die
right
so there might be 15 extra children
maybe five of them will die
uh anybody dying is a tragedy and you
know extra so for if it's a child so not
to minimize the fact that these are real
people not just statistics
five people being a tragedy of course
one person being a tragedy
but we do need to manage the country to
these risks and i don't believe that
they've been given to us straight by cnn
tell us the number next time
all right um
and then here's another one from cnn
quote some hospitals now report their
intensive care units which are usually
reserved for the most critically ill
patients are full
some hospitals
how many is some hospitals
how many hospitals are there
are there let's say
10 000 hospital i don't know
does anybody know how many hospitals
there are in the country a thousand
ten thousand
what would be anybody just tell me the
number of hospitals do do do a fact
check
but what are some hospitals have
are impacted
what what if there are ten thousand
hospitals
and five of them are somebody has a
number here fifteen hundred seven
seventy
there are about four thousand acute care
hospitals well your numbers are all over
the place people but let's say it's in
the low thousands
if you have hospitals in the low
thousands how many of them
are impacted some
some three
what would be some
three or four
how big is this problem
we're literally being
managed and manipulated because they
don't want us to know the number
obviously it'd be easy enough to find
the number how hard would it be for cnn
to say there are you know say 5 000
hospitals in the world whatever it is in
the country
and
seven of them are impacted
and we think
you would also say your prediction
seven of them are impacted we think
there could be
uh
bing says there's six thousand ninety
hospitals all right so let's say you say
there's six thousand hospitals and seven
of them are impacted
that would tell me something and maybe
we think there'll be a hundred impacted
and if they're in the big cities of
course that's a bigger deal
um
so now we're seeing the stories about
the people who had
medical problems because their surgeries
etc were
delayed
let me tell you my story just so you can
add an anecdote and it's dangerous to
add anecdotes
to your knowledge set when you're trying
to make decisions because they're too
influential but i'll give you one
example uh last year during the pandemic
i was scheduled to get sinus surgery
now a sinus surgery to remove some
polyps now sinus surgery is not the
biggest deal in the world
but
because it got delayed i had to be on
prednisone for way longer than normal uh
to keep things managed until the surgery
and i would say that there's a good
chance that that ruined my life
now i won't give you the details but
let's just say that it caused a series
of events
directly from the delayed
hospitalization that i think may have
ruined my life
you know
through a series of related events now
not health-wise health-wise i'm actually
fine
but
you can really up your life by
being sick for sick for six months that
you didn't expect
so for six months i could barely walk up
the stairs after i got off the
prednisone because you get addicted to
it so that was a problem so i lost i
lost six months of my life
um you didn't notice so much because i
could i could fake it on camera pretty
well but i was in bad shape
for about six months and it had
you know a consequence in my life
so these are pretty pretty big um things
going on with people delaying
hospitalization it's a big deal
and i can i can confirm that
um now of course cnn is trying to
persuade us by anecdote let's see how
they're doing
um
one of the things that cnn is doing is
they're sending don lemon out he went to
i think he was raised in alabama and he
went to alabama hospitals
and and he's talking to somebody who's
like in the intensive care i might be on
oxygen i'm not sure
but
don lemon asked this covent patient
about not getting vaccinated and says
do you regret it
do you regret it
so so
see the scene in your head don lemon in
the hospital talking to a guy who's
in bad shape
from the covid and he says do you regret
getting the vaccination
now
if you were to evaluate that as news
that's a failing grade
right as news it's a failure
because it's showing you an anecdote
that will mislead you about things
without the statistics statistics would
be good that would be news
and we certainly know if the news says
there are lots of people in the hospital
we know what that looks like
but if you show
one person
on camera
suffering with regret
i didn't hear the answer but i imagine
there was some regret there
that's persuasion that's pure persuasion
now how much good persuasion is there
you got a visual
because it was actually video of a guy
in the hospital that's that's a plus
visual
you've got fear
because it's the fear you put yourself
in that person's place and you say oh
that doesn't look good
fear it's visual
and then the last thing is you can put
yourself in it's personal
you can put yourself in the scene
so even though it's about somebody else
you pretty easily put yourself in the
bed right your brain just does that
automatically
so how good is that for
um
manipulation
a plus a plus if you were to give that a
grade for propaganda persuasion and
manipulation
a plus
now
let me uh let me correct myself i just
made a terrible mistake that i'd like to
correct
i called it manipulation
is that fair
not by my own definition so this is what
i'm going to correct myself in it's
manipulation
if you're trying to make somebody do
something that's good for you and bad
for them
that's my definition if i try to get you
to give me money
and it's not going to be good for you
but it's going to be good for me well
that's manipulation
if i can convince you to do that like
it's your own idea or something
but
what if i try to convince you to do
something that's good for you let's say
exercise and eat right
if i if i use persuasion to get you to
exercise and eat right
and you wanted to do those things
am i manipulating you
or persuading now i would call that
persuasion because that's a good
intention and everybody's on the same
page manipulation is when you're trying
to change somebody's mind and they don't
want to change their mind and they don't
see what's good about it
that's manipulation and that's what
that's what cnn was doing
cnn was changing your mind and you're
not sure that's good for you
it might be
i'm not saying it's not
i'm just saying you're not so sure so
that that gets into the manipulation but
my guess is the cnn is not
intending for a bad result
i don't think they intend a bad result
i think they want people to have good
outcomes
so i actually believe that they're
sincere in the sense that they would
like people to have better outcomes so
maybe that's not manipulation the way
they see it it might just turn out to
look like that
how many non-obese people in the united
states died of covet today anybody
anybody can you give me a number
what would be the most useful data you
could have
you should have a number of number of
people who died
number of people who were
hospitalized was you know intensive care
let's say
you need to know that
but after you knew that don't you need
to know how many were obese
and their age their age would be good
but i'll bet the obesity is just as
just as important
because your risk and how you run your
life will depend entirely on how many
people are getting hurt
if it's a tiny tiny number you're going
to do one thing if it's a big number
you'll do another and if you're not
obese
and the only people who are getting
getting bad outcomes or mostly
are the obese well you'd make different
decisions maybe
so here's a question i asked online i
said
imagine a president who persuaded people
to get fit to protect themselves and
protect the country at the same time
i don't know if we can handle that
right at various times we've had you
know presidential and you know
physical fitness initiatives and stuff
but yeah like jfk etc but
they didn't really go very far did they
now we've had obama who was a smoker
very sub-optimal
we should never have a president who's a
smoker in my opinion i think that's just
such a bad look
then we had
trump who literally doesn't exercise
and eats fast food
we've got biden who let me give him some
kudos biden is very fit
always has been i believe he's a runner
or has always been a runner so
biden is actually at least a good role
model but he doesn't do anything about
persuading people to get fitter and i
think
an excellent president would do that
hey today is the one year
