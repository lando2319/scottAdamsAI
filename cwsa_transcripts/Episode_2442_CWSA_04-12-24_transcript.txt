[Music]
just killing time until all the feeds
are here and everybody's
here all right I feel like it's
time it's
time is everybody here
good well this is coffee with Scott ads
the best time you're ever going to have
in your life if you'd like to take it up
to levels that nobody can even
understand with their pey human brains
all you need for that is a copper mugger
glass a tanker cherin a Cen Jugger flask
a vessel of any gu fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine hit of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it's going to happen now go
ah sound is working video is working
WiFi is screaming this might be the best
day you've ever
had yeah it might
be I mean there could be better ones
after this but if ever there was a time
when I thought I was running the
simulation it would be
today and you're going to see this in
every
story every every story today is going
to look like Scott did did you cause
that to happen did you did you will that
out of the universe and it just happened
let me begin with exhibit a for me
running the universe Story number one
daily coffee consumption is at a 20-year
high up nearly
40% probably a coincidence
sure but if you put it on a graph I
think you'd find that coffee consumption
tracks very well with coffee WIS Scott
Adams rise into dominance in the media
world no
coincidence nope you think about coffee
enough all right OJ Simpson is
dead um reportedly he died of
cancer but uh I think doctors are still
looking for the real
killer and uh is there any way that they
could get more ridiculous is there
anything we could do to this
story to completely discredit
Dei and all the race grifters because
that's exactly the sort of thing that
Scott would want to happen in the real
world well let's
check uh CNY Professor Mark Lamont Hill
he posted that uh OJ Simpson's
death um and his acquittal for murder
well he said that OJ's acquittal for
murder was the correct and necessary
result of a racist criminal legal system
sure he killed two people but because
he's part of a racist
system part of a racist system it was
fine that he goes free now I kind of
appreciate this
story uh because it's so
ridiculous that it just makes you
laugh like that's a good story but I'd
like to recount to you my only OJ story
uh some of you have heard this before
but it's a winner and because OJ passed
it's time to say it again true story
years ago when I had a problem with my
voice many of you know that story uh
before I got a corrected surgically I
went to a a famous voice doctor in
brenwood California to remember brenwood
home of OJ and uh this doctor he told me
that one of his prior patients had been
OJ Simpson So OJ Simpson had gone to a
voice doctor to improve his I don't know
dictation or something and uh when the
when the voice Doctor Who was very well
known he's he was was F famous in his
field when he decided to write a book
about his work as a voice doctor he
thought wouldn't it be great to get OJ
Simpson as one of the endorsements on
the back of the book so he goes to OJ
and OJ says sure of course gives him a
nice endorsement for his work and then
the doctor takes it to his publisher and
the publisher
says you know that he murdered two
people
right and that we probably shouldn't put
OJ Simpson accused murderer as a
recommendation for your
book and then my voice
doctor with the all-time best quip of
all time looked at his publisher and
said of
OJ he only had one bad
day and that's how I'd like OJ to be
remembered he only had one bad
day if you were to take the
average the average would look fine I
mean so I guess I have to agree with
Mark Lon Hill you should let him let him
get away with murder because how else
can you correct systemic
racism speaking of which a man dies in
custody uh saying I can't breathe and
police held him down and then he died
what do you think the uh medical
examiner ruled it
it was a black man who died uh doing a
George Floyd
impression maybe the same reason we
don't know but just like George Floyd
white police officers were restraining
him he was saying he couldn't breathe he
died and then the medical examiner ruled
it a homicide but no charges were filed
huh let's see if I can understand this
the medical examiner rules it a homicide
now that's exactly the kind of situation
that would trigger some kind of criminal
charges but it's a Dallas situation and
maybe they looked at it and said
no now how could you possibly explain a
medical
examiner who says it's homicide and yet
the other police
officers not so
sure well do you think that the medical
examiner is a Dei hire
what do you think what are what are the
odds could it be a Dei hire what if it's
not there are two possibilities if it's
a Dei hire it could be somebody who's
just trying to set things right and
let's say a mark Lamont Hillway as in
well this is one way I can work to
correct the racism that's been in demic
in this country for hundreds of years I
can fix this one thing by saying it's
homicide it could be
but it's also possible it's just a
generic white guy and the generic white
guy knows he'll be killed if he says
it's not homicide does that sound
familiar if you were the generic white
guy and it was your job to say was was
this homicide or accidental do you think
after the George Floyd situation that a
generic white guy medical examiner could
say you know I looked at this and it
just looks like an accident to me and
then he would just go on with his
life everything would be fine after that
right because he was honest he gave you
his real professional opinion and he
then he just goes on with his life am I
right no in no world is that medical
examiner safe the medical examiner has
to say homicide because is the only way
you can stay
alive because trust the experts am I
right let's let's sip a little coffee to
The
Experts well I'm sure glad that expert
uh the expert in the medical examination
field told us what's true because you
can believe it because the experts said
it right let's drink to The
Experts
experts we trust them we trust
them all right
how perfect is that
story well uh there's a study that says
that good-look lawyers both male and
female have more success in court so if
you're attractive you're more likely to
win and it's for both men and women and
at all levels of
experience
so you know this really supports my
decision to uh go into the cartooning
field some of you might know my story
when I went to college I thought I was
preaw my initial plan was I'm going to
get an economics degree and but I'll
make it sort of a pre-law thing and then
I'll go to law
school and then I looked in the mirror
and I said my God you're never going to
win a case with that face so I
immediately looked for a job in which
nobody could see
me so I thought well radio I do have a
face for radio
but cartooning even better yeah so if
you're not good-look enough to be a
lawyer try to be a cartoonist that's my
career
advice well here's some fake
science fake science fake
science there's a study that says people
who use willpower alone to achieve goals
and resist temptation are deemed uh more
trustworthy than those who use
tricks now a trick would be like oh I
have to put $5 in the swear jar because
I
swore or telling other people to bust
you if you uh break your diet so
basically if you use any
external crotch to help you do something
people will say you have less willpower
and so we don't trust you as much why is
this fake science
there's no such thing as
willpower willpower is not a
thing they they should have talked to
the other parts of
science they were actually studying a
thing that's
imaginary literally willpower doesn't
exist I just did a lesson for my members
in the uh the locals group so I do
little micro lessons two to four minutes
that gives you a life skill so after two
minutes you learn something you'll
you'll know how to do for the rest of
your life life now if you do about 200
of them which I have over 200 microl
lessons at the Scott adams. locals.com
um you would know that willpower is
literally imaginary so they did a whole
study on a thing that's literally
doesn't exist and then they came to a
result because they're the experts let
me tell you I'll give you the quick
version of why willpower doesn't
exist there are only differences and
preferences
if you say Scott I'm not going to feed
you for two weeks and then I'm going to
put some ice cream in front of you would
I resist I haven't eaten in two weeks
but you know I don't want ice cream
because it's bad for me a little too
much sugar do you think I'd resist
starving after two weeks no I'd eat it I
would eat a Lunchables that that's how
hungry I would be right now where's the
willpower in that story none no I was
more hungry than I was carrying about a
few calories now you could take that
silly example and you could extend it to
literally everything and in every case
you'll see it's very clear somebody just
picked the choice that was the better
choice there's no willpower do you know
how I keep my weight exactly at the
right number I'm I'm literally precisely
at my target adult weight I I don't want
to gain a pound don't want to lose a
pound I'm exactly right do you know how
much willpower it took none because it
doesn't exist all I did was I did stuff
like remove junk food from my house
learned a little bit more about you know
what's good for me so I did learning I
removed things from my environment
where's the willpower there's no
willpower and then I learned um you know
through trial and error I learned what
things were causing me inflammation and
causing me to gain weight so it turns
out for me probably wheat I'm not you
know it's not a scientific study but
anecdotally when when I got rid of Wheat
and some other sugary things I can't
even gain weight it wouldn't even be
possible so if you live your life like
willpower doesn't exist you're going to
get much better results because instead
of
going willpower trying really hard that
doesn't get you much how about just
removing the junk food from your house
that'll get you a lot how about learning
more about how to make um boring food
taste good that'll get you a
lot so no science should talk to the
other parts of science which do know
that willpower and Free Will don't exist
but they studied it do you know why they
studied the thing that doesn't
exist because they're experts they're
experts let's drink to The Experts shall
we to The
Experts love those experts
let's see if anything else in the news
along those
lines all right here's a recommendation
that um I don't know how much of this is
real but it feels
real um I think I may have told you this
before you know Andrew huberman he talks
about the importance of getting early
morning
sun taking off your sunglasses and
standing in the Sun for 5 minutes in the
morning and that's a bit sunny I guess
you stand there longer if it's a cloudy
day and that's supposed to set your set
your body rhythms for the rest of the
day now I'm not an expert so I don't
know if that's true or not but also
there are claims from other people that
you can if you take off your shoes and
go outside you can do grounding where it
I know resets your electrical forces or
something I don't know if that's real I
have no idea and then there's also the
huberman breathing technique where you
do the two long inhales through your
nose
and then one exhale and you only have to
do it I don't know three or four times
and that resets some of your bodily
nervous system or something so what I
discovered or it's sort of obvious
actually is that you can do all three at
the same time do any of them have any
real scientific backing I don't know
because science is not something that I
would trust do you know why I don't
trust and don't know if grounding
getting Sun or the breathing technique
work
because it comes from
experts anybody who trusts the experts
in 2024 is just guessing but I'll tell
you what I did do since I could do all
three of these at the same time I mean
what are you going to do when you're
standing there in the Sun so I take off
my shoes Outdoors stand in the sun do a
few hubman breaths and I've done all
three things now so there's a you know
I've got three shots that at least one
of those things makes a difference in
the real world I don't know so here's my
experience oh my god do I feel good when
I do it
immediately it's the damnest thing I
just walk outside take off my shoes do
that breathing in the Sun and I feel
extraordinary and it does in fact feel
as though it kicks your day off to a
good day can I prove it nope do I
believe it's true because the experts
told me nope I just know it's three
things that can't hurt me they can't
hurt me right so I do them and then it
makes me feel happy what if it's not
really working but it makes me think
it's
working that's called
working you get that right since I'm
trying to I'm resetting my mental state
as as much as anything else if I walk
away thinking it worked it worked I
don't need I don't need to hook any
electrodes to my body
if I think I'm
happy good enough all right so that's uh
that's worth
trying have you ever had this experience
that if you try to explain the real
world to people you know the Mike Ben's
version you you you can't do it without
sounding
crazy and it's in this category of
things which can't be communicated it's
one of my favorite like mental things to
think about I just love thinking about
things which are true and can be put
into words but it still can't be
communicated let me give you an example
the little boy who cried wolf right he
he pretended he saw a wolf until finally
when he saw a real wolf he tried to tell
people in clear language that was true
there's a wolf but he couldn't
communicate it because he created a
situation where they were just sort of
you know deaf to his statements about
wolves now the the Mike Ben's let's say
I like to use him as just a simple way
to describe the the larger blob of you
know the government working with Nos and
the Atlantic Council and how Soros is
connected as their banker and it might
involve all the these other
International things and how they
affected the the the platforms and the
news and it's so
complicated that as soon as you start
explaining it to a normie you know
somebody who's had no exposure to this
idea whatsoever and they think they're
living in a democracy or a some kind of
Republic which I don't think we have for
decades um you can't explain it and I'm
I'm not I'm only bringing up because
it's
fascinating how you can hide stuff one
of the ways you can hide
stuff is right in front of people you
just have to make it complicated that's
it yeah as long as something's
complicated you can hide anything do you
know what's complicated
climate
change it's complicated you know what's
complicated are
elections I'm not in the concept level
but when you get down to who's doing
what and how many moving Parts it's kind
of
complicated so everywhere that there's
something that's
complicated it's probably really bad
because that's where you hide all the
bad stuff is in the
complications yeah manufactured consent
yeah that's part of it
anyway um I finally figured out what it
is that makes MSNBC look different from
CNN CNN looks like people who are
sometimes knowing they're
lying and sometimes don't know they're
lying you know they might actually
believe their own news but here's what
they don't look
like they don't always look
crazy that's my take I when I watch CNN
nobody has crazy eyes you know I I keep
calling out people who have obvious
mental illness problems you can see it
in their eyes I don't I when I look at
Jake Tapper do I say to myself that
guy's crazy no no he's completely sane
when I look at Wolf Blitzer totally same
totally same when you look at ra Rachel
madow does she look sane to you I mean
really when you look at
uh Lawrence
O'Donnell does he look
sane I mean really does he now let me
give you a contrast just so I'm not
making fun of all of their hosts when I
look at Ary melber does he look insane
no not even a little bit he could leave
MSNBC and work on CNN tomorrow because
he looks like the CNN people they might
be misled about something they might be
wrong but don't look crazy they look
like people doing their job as they see
it now here's what really sets me over
the top and makes
MSNBC a comedy for me CNN is fascinating
and I I recommend you watch it just to
find out what they're telling their
people just to be well informed about
what uh people you don't agree with
necessarily are saying but when I watch
MSNBC I'm actually watching it for the
jokes meaning that I find it hilarious
and I finally figured out what it was
that makes it so
funny it's the
smugness the
smugness if somebody's just mentally ill
it's just
disturbing if somebody is perfectly sane
and
smug sometimes sometimes they're just
popular I would say Hannity is kind of
smug wouldn't you Sean Hannity he seems
a little smug maybe you'd say he's just
confident but little smoke but he
doesn't come off as as like
comedy cuz he looks like he's doing his
job and you know even if he knows he's
exaggerating he probably knows it you
know nothing
crazy but if you look at Lawrence
O'Donnell or Rachel
madow they're super
smug but the things they say are crazy
if you had smug and crazy it's
hilarious so when I watch it I'm like oh
my God what am I watching
this is the funniest thing smug and
crazy at the same
time anyway um there some people are
thinking that so-called AGI or super AI
intelligence is coming and it's real
close open AI fired two
people um for allegedly for leaking
information now um I I saw online some
speculation that you know it's obvious
what it was they leaked well that's not
obvious to me but the speculation is
that um the leak is about something
called
qar a rumored super intelligence that
will come out of AI open AI fairly
soon who believes that how many of you
believe that the leaks were about as
super Ai and they were on the verge of
something we've never seen
before I'm going to say no I'm going to
bet against it I think it was probably a
league I mean that part might be true
but I doubt it was about a super
intelligence which will'll all be
frightened to hear about I think
everything's going to be
incremental that's what I think I think
all AI Improvement will be incremental
but still astonishing when anybody looks
back at it so I think the things we
think are going to happen in a month are
going to take two
years and they'll be amazing but we'll
have so much time to adjust to it that
the amazing part might wear off you know
you'll just be well there's another
that's a little 5% better than that last
one so I'm going to be I'm on the uh
underwhelmed side of things for
AI and I'm happy to be wrong i' love to
be wrong but I think it would be
underwhelmed well you probably all saw
the story of Representative Sheila Lee
Jackson at a public event speculating
out loud how we could possibly settle
the moon because it's made of gas and uh
how how exactly do you build something
on top of gas so that big old Round Moon
she said was a just a big gaseous thing
and okay now you probably say to
yourself okay but she's a politician so
you don't really expect your politicians
to know everything about
science it'd be good if they knew the
basics but you know you give them a pass
they're the representative want wanted
them there so if the public wanted them
as a representative and you know they're
not having much to do with any sciency
stuff that would be fair I mean as long
as she's not involved directly in any
kind of science decision does it really
matter well here's a little background
you didn't know she used to be on the
house space and Aeronautics
subcommittee yeah yeah one of our
experts in the
government uh who was on the house space
and aono committee thinks the moon is
made of gas well let's have a drink to
our experts shall
we not just the scientific experts but
the political experts the ones who are
serving on the house space and
Aeronautics subcommittee who think the
moon is made of gas here's to
you but you know even as I tell you how
many experts are wrong about
things at least they got climate change
right am I right like thank God I mean
because that's it so important but all
these experts in all these fields
clearly lying or wrong or bash crazy but
at least at least climate change is
believable incredible and pure science
really let see next
story uh Harvard Yale MIT and brown are
all returning to standardized tests now
that's a surprise because you think that
the smartest people in the country you
know the people running these higher
level institutions when they decided
that not testing people before uh
admitting them was a good idea I'm
really surprised that that didn't work
out huh have I ever told you that if you
don't measure you're not
managing that's one of your one of those
little bumper scker rules that pops up
all the time if you're not measuring it
you know with some kind of legitimate
measurement system you're not
managing it's not managing to say well
i' should like to have more of this or
less of that you need to have a real
idea of what you're shooting at or
you're not really managing and you're if
you're not watching if you're going in
the right direction of the wrong it
can't be called managing but the
smartest institutions in fact Harvard
wants to teach you how to make decisions
and be an economist and a and a business
person and uh and they didn't know that
the number one rule of management is you
got to you got to measure things so if
you'd like to get your MBA at Harvard
just know you're taught by people who
were caught by
surprise that measuring things made a
difference when they were trying to
manage things didn't work out so it
looks like they had a choice of being
super racist at the same time of being
overpriced and those are two things that
they couldn't pull off at the same time
we'd like to be
overpriced but we'd also really like to
be super racist and then the public said
hold on hold on that's too
far you can be overpriced or you can be
super racist but you cannot be both
that's too much that's too much Harvard
so Harvard said well as much as we love
being super racist I guess it would be
better to be high
paid so they chose the money over the
principal
experts here's to the experts at Harvard
who are teaching you how to manage
without measuring things to them to
them so good well even though your
highest uh educational facilities who
teach people science and business even
though they apparently don't understand
science or business the one thing we can
feel confident in is that they did
produce
scientists who really got climate change
right because if there's one thing the
scientists can do outside of the college
you know environment they they can
measure the temperature of the planet am
I right they can measure the temperature
of the planet so at least that's we got
that working for us so good news on on
that
front oh this is
awkward wow kind of bad luck that this
story came up in the order it did well
now I just feel like a dope Zero Hedge
is reporting that as many as 30% of all
the
thermometers that they use for the
temperatures don't
exist H I wonder if that's a problem in
the accuracy
so they're called ghost
thermometers and they're thermometers
that used to exist at one point but now
they no longer do so what they do the
the people who are measuring the
data let's call them the experts
probably all came from Harvard and MIT
and Yale but I don't know that for sure
but um when they go to measure and they
realize that there used to be a
thermometer there but now there isn't
what they do is they take the average of
other therm
om so let's say you used to have an old
one but now the old one's gone now it's
been replaced with a new one and it's
not even necessarily in the same
place so you take the average of the
temperatures of the thermometers that
are not where the old one was and you
throw that in
mix 30% of
them 30%
that's the
claim um let's see uh Mr
shuchuk said the US hcn stations they
reached a maximum of over 1,200 so in
1957 we had over
1,200 temperature measuring stations or
thermometers but after 1990 the number
of active stations became declining due
to aging equipment and Personnel
retirements huh
you know I lived in the real world for a
while and I worked in a laboratory in
which all we did was work with equipment
and Technology every day equipment and
technology and uh you know what I
learned when I was working with
equipment and
Technology all that equipment and
technology is 100% effective all the
time and it never breaks never gets out
of
calibration never gets out of tune and
is completely unaffected by temperature
and the incompetence of the people
involved no that's the opposite of what
I
learned now I would like to take a bow
in a moment but only after I tell you
why and and then I'll I'll see if you
believe I I deserve a bow okay you you
get to decide if you say yes Scott you
can take a bow then I'll do it but if
you say no if you say no they'll say all
right all right you have
spoken who told you name anybody else
who told you this that in the real world
you can't trust on people to read
thousands of
thermometers and compare it to 100 years
ago when we didn't have thermometers and
we had tree rings and Ice core samples
and come up with a believable credible
line that passes all scientific
integrity
and I said in the real world that is
literally not possible there is no
situation in which you could have 12200
thermometers and maybe a thousand people
involved and that they're measuring the
temperature and getting something like a
real
result do you believe that with having
no scientific background
whatsoever that using the dilber filter
which is what I did I used the dilber
filter that the real world does not have
any kind of competence that could
possibly produce accurate temperature
readings with the equipment used things
changing over time and then human beings
involved in the process who told you
that that isn't even possible just
me who who who else
predicted that if you actually looked
into it it would look
absurd just me I'm the only
one do I do I deserve
bow you tell
me what do you mean no damn
you damn
you all right all right did Linden no
the so let me
uh let me give you a different take on
that so somebody said that a
professional climate scientist said that
well the climate scientist didn't say
exactly this story but the climate
scientists do say you know for this
reason or that reason the accuracy is
not good now from a scientific
perspective and somebody within the
industry you that may be an accurate
take but I'm not even in the industry
and I'm saying that you don't need to be
a climate scientist who has worked
deeply in Industry you just have to
listen to what they said wait you just
told me you measured the temperature of
the earth so accurately that you can
tell what direction it's going in why I
don't believe that I don't believe that
for a second so the the dilbur
principle of just general incompetence
really guarantees this isn't doable
because it's too manual has too many
pieces of equipment involved too much
you know moving things around too much
temperature and weather
destruction too much bureaucracy yes I
would say that uh this is pretty solid
evidence that we don't know if the
temperatur is going up or down it's not
my opinion that I know by the way so
it's not my opinion that I know
everything's fine climate wise it's my
opinion that we can't measure
it that's a very big difference so it
could be a crisis maybe how would I know
in order to know I would have to trust
science
really it's 2024 who trusts science
doesn't even feel like a
thing now let me ask you
this how long do you think it will take
Trump and let's say
V to turn the and let's say this needs
some uh confirmation so it would be
great if we had some confirmation of
this but suppose we get confirmation
that 30% of the thermometers or ghost
thermometers how long would it take V
and
Trump to turn that into a victory dance
and say well we can't tell you what the
temperature is doing we can just tell
you that they didn't
know and maybe it was a hoax would you
say it's a
hoax if I told you that 30% of the
thermometers don't exist would you say
it's a
hoax maybe not but it's not that far
away is
it all
right um Trump did the funniest Trump
thing I mean I every time Trump does
something you don't quite
expect it feels
like he's just operating on some
different level so here's what he did he
just did some video commercials uh
recommending RFK
Jr his
competitor and he and he actually meant
it because he's aware that Democrats are
more likely to vote for him so he just
comes right out and says in
videos um he said that RFK J is a better
man than Biden and he says quote Ark Jr
is as you know the most radical left
candidate so he's making sure that that
there are no Republicans who want to go
that way so he characterizes them as the
most radical left that should that
should eliminate all the Republicans
from voting for him but he says uh he is
uh more so than the green party even
lefter than the green party says Trump
and says he's uh more so even than
crooked Joe Biden but he's got some nice
things about him I happen to like
him
uh and and then Trump says I guess I
would mean RFK junor is going to be
taking away votes from crooked Joe Biden
and he should because he's actually
better than Biden he's much better than
Biden he's much better than
Biden now how much do you love that have
you ever seen that have you ever some
seen somebody just come right out and
say you know what
the this other guy is better than the
guy you're voting for he's not as good
as me but you should at least at least
not vote for that other guy because
that's a
disaster would you like to hear what the
young people in my town
say here's what the young people in my
town say about Joe
Biden and RFK
Jr and I'm told that there are no
exceptions no exceptions now I I can't
Pro that but I'm told there are no
exceptions to what I'm just going to say
at the uh young person sort of you know
teenager young adult level when asked
about politics they'll say you know RFK
Jr is kind of attractive but there's no
way in hell I'd support Biden and those
are
Democrats you know those are people who
come from Democrat backgrounds they're
literally saying Biden is not even not
even close to being a possibil
they're saying RFK Jr all the way the
young people now they're not saying
Trump the boys are the bo the boys are
more likely to say Trump but the girls
are saying you know what RFK Jr looks a
lot better than
Biden do you know what makes uh women
decide on a
candidate is whether they'd have sex
with
them it's whether they' have sex with
them is that is that too far nope no
that would would be a normal way that
all human beings uh act did I not just
tell you they did a study that said that
lawyers who are more attractive are more
likely to win cases I just told you that
this is exactly that this is just more
of that we all know that tall presidents
or tall candidates do better than short
ones do you know why because people want
to sleep with tall ones same as dating
exactly the same taller is
better so if you look at Joe Biden who
is literally you know a desicated pile
of twigs and you compare him to RFK Jr
who's
ripped you can understand why young
women are saying you know I think I
politically agree with RFK Jr they have
no idea what any of their policies are
there's no policy decision yeah do you
think an 18-year-old looking at RFK Jr
and Biden knows the policy differences
between those two not a chance they just
know which one they'd bang that's it and
that's enough that's enough should
guarantee a Trump trump a win unless
it's
rigged anyway let's talk about RFK Jr
who did the most amazing thing on Aaron
Bernett show and CNN so the Vigilant Fox
is reporting about this has a nice
summary on X the Vigilant Fox another
good another good follow on X just look
for it the Vigilant Fox anyway um RFK JR
says that Aaron Bernett brain stopped
working when he made the stunning
argument on about Biden on CNN all right
so let's see if you think this is as
good as uh the Vigilant Fox does right
so here was the
argument Kenny said there's no court
that found that President Trump tried to
steal the election or tried to derail
the election or tried to start an
insurrection
however there are courts that have found
that President Biden was censoring his
opponents and not just
me and then Kennedy said although he did
sensor me and I did win that
suit so it's not just me making it
up oh my
God how much do I love that man right
now RFK Jr is the person who I could
disagree with the most and love the most
at the same
time because what he's done is he's
dismantled their strongest argument
against the election being rigged but he
doesn't know he did it well he might
know but um so that the
conversation is about whether the
president is an insurrectionist that
happens to be Biden's strongest argument
against Trump because Biden went from
what uh he went from Biden omic which
now everybody's reporting he got rid of
because of inflation so he had to give
up on bomic he did the whole the the
Army is full of white supremacists and
and then when they tried to root them
out they didn't find any and then it
seems like they've been silent about all
the white supremacists lately have you
noticed that like Biden was all about
the white supremacist but there hasn't
been really a problem and nobody was
buying it and there weren't any in the
military so the white supremacist thing
like biomics was something they tried
and doesn't look like it
worked so they've settled on this whole
threat to
democracy threat to democracy and also
specifically that he doubted the
elections and when they say he must be a
a he must be a dictator because he
doubted the
elections do you know why they can say
that they can only say it because no
court found that the election was
rigged and now our K Jr comes at comes
at him with the Judo reframe of all time
and says there's no court that found
that President Trump tried to steal the
election derail it or start an
Insurrection and that's just a
fact so you can't have it both ways if
you're going to claim the election was
good because no court found it wasn't
you're going to have to find that no
court founding was an insurrectionist
and you're going to have to eat that
 and Earth G Jr is going to shove it
down your throat on live TV if you if
you don't like
it so to me RFK Jr just
dismantled the entire uh gaslighting
operation of the Democrats right in
front of
you that's kind of
amazing now what I hope is that uh VI
and Trump see this and pick up that
argument because it's a killer it's a
it's a absolute
killer absolute killer and here's what
I'd love to
see and maybe you don't want to start
too soon it looks like um the Democrats
want to ride this whole
insurrectionist threat to
democracy I think Trump should allow
them to keep that argument until they're
so committed to it it's just the
brand and then he should mock it out of
existence you could mock the uh dictator
thing away just by acting like a normal
person imagine Trump going into
Chick-fil-A some of you saw the video
everybody loved him he was he was
hugging on and taking selfies with a lot
of black women were there was you know
which is a great look for a
politician imagine him going into
Chick-fil-A and while the camera is
running
and somebody's taking a selfie with them
let's let's say just to make the picture
good it's a it's a young black woman
who's just thrilled to be in his
presence and then he turns to her and
says the news says I'm going to be a
dictator do I seem like a dictator to
you and then just laugh and then the
person will laugh and you will learn
that there are no people who think it
it's just a news thing there are no
people who think it and by the way if
you did think it and you met him you
would stop thinking it within 5 Seconds
let me give you a
demonstration of trump changing somebody
who believe who believes he's a dictator
into someone who doesn't believe
it pat in the back Shake of the hands
how are you doing today oh wow looks
like you're doing great I'm glad you're
supporting me how are the sandwiches
here and you're done and people would
say how did anybody think he was a
dictator that that was the least stalish
thing I've ever seen in my life he asked
me about my sandwich he came into
Chick-fil-A you know where anybody could
hurt him because he's right in the
middle of the crowd by the way did you
notice the Secret Service did not keep
the people away how about that's the
biggest
Story how about that how about you
missed the biggest story Trump walked
into a middle of a crowd unannounced
a very largely black crowd
unannounced just walked in now the
Secret Service was there but there's no
way they could have protected them
people literally had their arms around
them you you can't protect somebody if
somebody's up to no
good yeah he basically trusted the crowd
and they immediately
reciprocated immediately all he has to
do is trust the crowd now it's dangerous
because you know there could be it only
takes one crazy person but Trump
trusting the public is such a good look
and I would love to see him engage to
the public and just ask the
question do I do I look like a dictator
to
you and and to imagine that he thinks
that would be his best
play in What world would that be his
best play to become a dictator at age
whatever it's not a good play it would
guarantee his entire family got
slaughtered what kind of a good play is
that it would guarantee his businesses
were destroyed it would guarantee like
Civil War now compare that to the
alternative the alternative of just
doing a good job and then leaving office
after his four years which one is better
for Trump and his
family unambiguously
better to restore America to his former
greatness as best he can
and to walk out with dignity having
proven everything he need to prove and
then let his business Thrive let history
think well of him and become the most
popular president in the history of the
United States you don't think he wants
that you think he'd rather be a dictator
and hated by everyone it's crazy now if
there's one thing that Trump wants he
wants the public to like him he doesn't
want to be a dictator that'd be crazy
but a lot of crazy people are convinced
it's
true all right speaker Johnson finally
told the truth about why he changed his
mind about fisa now he is pro- fisa
where he used to be anti fisa and he
says and Mike cernovich phrases this
exactly correct he got the
talk he got the talk now who told you
name anybody else who told you this that
I believe that the top people the
president and you know the leaders of
the parties that when they when they get
power but not until then only after they
have their power that the intelligence
groups call them in and they say here's
all the stuff you didn't know
before here's all the stuff you didn't
know before and this is why nothing you
knew is real and you better you better
do it this
way that was me
and he's saying it he's saying it
directly that when he found out what the
intelligence people told him he can't
tell you what they said but he's pretty
sure he's got to do what they said now
here's something Tucker added that I
think is a real good addition to that
idea how does speaker Johnson know that
what the intelligence people told him is
true no way there's no way he knows
what's true so if he doesn't know what's
true who's running the
country because probably speaker Johnson
thinks he's one of the people running
the country or at least you know big
part of the government because he knows
this new
information but what if it's not
true if it's not
true then the intelligence people are
running the
country what if it is true but it's also
what the intelligence people want to
happen well then the intelligence people
are running the country so there are two
possibilities what they told them is
true which means the intelligence people
are determining how things go they're in
charge or it's not
true and they're still in charge because
they're telling you something to make
you act in the way they want based on
false but either
way this is confirmation that the
government is not the
government and Johnson said it directly
he said they showed him things and if
and if you knew what he saw you would
change your
mind now if he had to guess do you think
he saw real
things I honestly doubt it because again
I'm going to put the dilbur filter on
this if you put the dilbur filter on it
and you give somebody unlimited power
the unlimited power to lie to the
government and make them act like they
believe
it who doesn't use unlimited
power in the history of everything if
you give somebody that kind of power
they're going to not use it of course
they are they're going to use it every
chance they get now they might not use
it for small stuff you know because they
don't care about the small stuff but if
let's say it was a difference between
funding Ukraine and not funding Ukraine
do you think anybody's going to tell
them the
truth I don't think
so not not a chance here's what I think
probably happen I think they called him
and said here's why we need fisa we
can't tell the public but we fisa is the
only reason we thed three nuclear
terrorist
attacks and he'd be like what I never
heard there were any nuclear terrorist
attacks he goes well that's because we
did such a good job we kept it from the
public so they wouldn't panic and and
also that people wouldn't know our
sources and means but we have thwarted
three terrorist I'm just making this up
if you're joining me late none of this
is real but we we thwarted three nuclear
terrorist attacks and here's the thing
speaker Johnson you can't tell
anybody do you
promise oh well really if you thwarted
three nuclear attacks I have to admit I
didn't want this fisa stuff but I mean
the responsible thing to do is to make
sure we don't get nuked I don't want
that on my record so I guess I'm going
to trust you yeah going to trust you
so it seems to me that whether or not
speaker Johnson heard something true or
false he did confirm that he's not in
charge and that the government's not in
charge now do you think this trick would
work on the president if you if you said
Joe Biden you don't know this but we
know this and you better at not tell
anybody of course it would it would
literally work on
everyone you put me in that situation
and I'm totally aware of all the risk
right I know what tricks they might play
they could turn me so fast it
would be one second and I'd be flipped
because this situation is unre it's it's
irresistible nobody's going to say yeah
I do want to take a a healthy 30% chance
that you're lying to me and I'm going to
ignore the nuclear risk you just told me
we avoided with
fisa nobody makes that decision you you
say if they told you you're going to
rely on them even if it's
because that's just the better
play all right Marjorie Taylor green is
still against the fisa stuff but she is
not been read into the uh the secret
things here's what I
like yeah you want to compromise I'll
give you a
compromise speaker
Johnson I will be on your team
and I will agree with extending fisa
under the following
conditions you put Marjorie Taylor Green
in the skiff and you tell her what they
told you if her detector
doesn't ring off the hook and she says
oh jeez I didn't know that okay okay now
that I know that I'm going to change my
mind I would be a lot more comfortable
if you put somebody with the
you know the world siiz balls of Margery
tailor Green in that room and she tells
me so let me say it again I don't trust
speaker Johnson I don't know him you
know I'm not saying he's a liar I just
don't know him so I don't trust him but
I've been watching margerie Taylor green
for some
time and and by the way if you put Matt
gates in there I wouldn't believe
him right I don't I don't have that
level of trust with
him not you know not that I you not that
there's some specific thing it's just I
don't know
so but Marjorie Taylor green I've Got a
Feeling is purely a a
patriot I mean every signal she sends is
that she's in it for the right reason
you know even if you don't like her
style or whatever she really seems like
she's in this for the right reason you
Ben in the military probably makes a
difference so that would be that's
that's my take so in marjerie Taylor
green and let her come out and tell me
that she saw the same thing speaker
Johnson did and if they both are on the
same team I'm going to get a little
flexible about
fisa yeah I'm going to get a little bit
flexible all right coincidentally FBI
director says there are more threats
than there have ever been well doesn't
that work perfectly doesn't it oh isn't
it great that that FBI director says
there's more terrorist threats than
we've ever seen at the same time they're
talking about fisa the best way to stop
those terrorist
threats so that that fits kind of snugly
doesn't it just a
coincidence well there's a new covid
whistleblower
um this
says that uh well it's everything you
knew was true the United States or
members of it including fouchi
absolutely did plan and execute and and
were
funded um the gain of function research
to make Corona virus more
deadly I'm going to say that's confirmed
as confirmed as anything could be now
you have to worry about fake news and
fake whistleblowers but you know
everything about this looks just so
obvious do you all agree that that we
could now say it's just the fact the
fouchi was crooked fouchi lied it was
obviously some secret government program
but here are the two questions that we
have not seen
addressed why were they doing
that what why were they making a deadly
virus now the the answers I've seen are
that they're making the deadly virus so
that they would be better prepared if
somebody else made a deadly
virus does that sound
real because you could do that with
everything you could you could have a
little laboratory coming up with every
damn thing that could go wrong just so
you're ready in case somebody else does
it
no no that's not
believable that sounds like total
 yeah so why was it that we ever
believed that fouchi maybe didn't do
this and it was some kind of you know
some kind of pangol and had sex with the
back kind of situation why did we ever
believe that or anybody I don't maybe
you didn't but why did anybody believe
that it's because of the experts let's
drink to The
Experts they got this Co stuff they got
this climate change and they've they've
studied things yeah here's the
experts all right let's see oh and we
have another
whistleblower bre B news
reporting that uh there was a guy Mike
mccormic who's got a new book and
apparently he was like a super Insider
like he was in the
room so uh I I see him described as
Biden's
stenographer but do they mean that
metaphorically or literally a
stenographer but he was in the room
here's what he says he says he
personally witnessed Biden negotiate the
burisma kickback scheme us funding to
Ukraine energy primarily burisma in
exchange for putting Hunter Biden on
bre's board of directors on a trip to
Poland in
2014
um
wow he says uh Biden's former National
Security Aid Jake Sullivan is at the
center of the
Scandal
um and uh McCormack recalled he told
that Sullivan told reporters in 2014 on
Air Force
2
um as an anonymous senior Administration
so it must have been on background or
something that the United States
intended to help Ukraine's natural gas
industry
so everything you thought was
true as a direct witness
now oh my God and and uh I think you've
heard I think breit Bard and other
places you've heard that Jake Sullivan
has always seemed like he was the center
of all of this and now we've got a
witness that says he was and uh it's
every bit as corrupt as it looks like so
Ukraine was an energy play a corruption
play a CIA play but what it wasn't is
defending democracy against Putin
although there might have been some
people who cared about that as well so I
think that the United States is
essentially a criminal cartel and it's
been using essentially Mafia tactics to
take over Russia and get control of
their energy um and that Russia too is
basically a you know a mobster situation
with a lot of energy so to me it looks
like two criminal elements organized
criminal gangs United States versus
Russia fighting over
uh resources
that's what I see how's history going to
write it now when history writes this
story are they going to say well United
States has been a criminal organization
maybe for decades and they ran a play
there was essentially a criminal Rico
kind of situation to take over Russia's
energy and told the United States it was
all about Freedom or some damn thing
meanwhile Russia of course is not a real
country it's just a gas station with an
army basically a criminal Enterprise so
really it was a contest between two
criminal Enterprises with Bill ions of
dollars at stake do you think your
history book is going to say
that well probably
not um let's see what what could
possibly bolster this claim that the
Biden Administration is corrupt I wonder
if there's any other story in the news
right now that would make you scratch
your head and say well there it
is next
story uh
CBS news reporter Katherine herriage
says the network
CBS fired her took all their notes and
she's never seen anything like that they
took her personal notes they took her
computer when they fired her and what
was she working on at the
time oh a story involving Joe Biden's
corruption so
CBS moved on her like OJ on Nicole
because they found out she was working
on a story about Biden's
corruption and I'm guessing she found
some I'm guessing she found
some so they shut her down how many of
you thought that the news was real and
that the news organizations are they're
just doing their news organization thing
nope they've always just been a Democrat
tool at least in recent years and uh
here it is everything you thought
about climate change was right they
can't measure it everything you thought
about fouchy and
Co was
true it was a big old cover up and we
don't even know why they were doing it
we still don't even know why we just
know what
happened and then the Biden corruption
stuff in Ukraine and Ukraine war it's
exactly what it looks like exactly what
it looks like
what a
day well there reports that Iran is
planning a calibrated attack so as you
know uh Israel took out some of its uh
commanders and I think they had an
embassy an Iranian Embassy in Syria or
something and if you had an embassy
that's a whole higher level of War
because the embassy is considered
sovereign territory of the country that
has the or consulate a consulate not an
embassy um
and so Iran Iran is saying that you know
hey that's like our it's like our own
territory so we're going to have to
respond and the uh Intel people think
that if it's going to happen it's going
to happen in the next few days um here's
what I
think I think that Israel is getting the
trumpan benefit of
unpredictability and what what I mean by
that is when Hamas did their attack on
Israel um I Heard reports of some them
thought they were going to take over
Israel that sounds crazy to me but um I
think they assumed I'm just observing it
like everybody else it seems to me that
Hamas must have assumed that Israel's
response to the attack would be somewhat
similar to how they've responded to
other attacks in other words there would
be some uh some proportional response
and you know maybe a thousand Hamas
people get killed but they still have 29
th000 left over and they just start over
but instead Israel called their
Bluff took G away from them forever
destroyed their civilization and it's
never coming back now do you think they
expected that nope and what did that buy
Israel as a permanent
asset trumpian
unpredictability now Iran has a new
situation they've never seen before
which is always before they could sort
of predict if we do this they'll
probably do something that's similar not
anymore in fact I'll go further if
Israel ever intended to take out the
leadership of
Iran all they need is for Iran to make
an attack on the
Homeland or or just do something
provocative even if it's not on Israel
proper Israel just needs a reason and
they're going to take out the
Ayatollah now in in any other situation
could they take out the
Ayatollah nope nope only this one only
this one because they said we're going
to kill everybody who is
responsible who else was
responsible the Israeli lead I'm sorry
the Iranian leadership I mean that's
what we're told I mean I can't I I don't
have direct reporting but everybody
seems to think that an Iranian
leadership was behind the Hamas attack
Israel said directly we're going to kill
every one of them that would include
Iranian the Iranian
leadership just give them a
reason this is the only time in history
that I can think of that if Israel
literally took out the entire
leadership they could get away with
it now you say to yourself not
guaranteed you're right it's not
guaranteed nothing's guaranteed gued
it's War it's a it's a war for existence
nothing's
guaranteed but there has never been a
more ideal time for Israel to end the
risk of the Iranians nuking them in the
future than right now all they have to
do is say look we told you we were going
to get everybody involved we we took out
the head of the snake and by the way we
have no quarrel whatsoever with even the
Iranian military we have no
quarrel we only wanted the people who
are behind the planning and execution of
this attack and I'm sorry it just
happened to include the Ayatollah and
all of his generals so they're
gone now we'd love to help you Iran
recover we'd love to bring you into the
fold make you part of the you know
Abraham Accords plus someday but at the
moment we are completely
unpredictable and anything you thought
we wouldn't do last year we will to do
this year this year is not last year
whatever you think might be our
proportional response stop thinking that
there's no limit to our proportional
response meaning it's not going to be
proportional that ladies and gentlemen
is the
Trump
premium Trump taught you that being
predictable basically Dooms you being
predictable Dooms you you because you
can't negotiate and you can't frighten
everybody knows what's going to happen
so you have to create a
realistic frame that if you hit us we
might take you around completely and you
have to you have to set a precedent
because if you haven't done it in the
real world it's just talk now Gaza is
being basically disappeared do you think
there's anybody in Iran who is watching
what's happening in Gaza and says to
them
I think those Israelis are in the mood
to be
proportional no no they are not in the
mood to be proportional they're
certainly going to be rational but
they're not going to be proportional
they're not in the mood and they don't
need to be they just don't need to be so
I'm not recommending it and I'm not
predicting
it I'm just saying Iran needs to
understand that if they did something
serious to Israel and Israel in response
took out their entire
leadership the world would
yawn the world would yawn that's never
been the case before and it may never be
again there may never be another time
you could do this and get away with it
and by the way I don't know if they
could get away with it but all the other
times they definitely couldn't you know
a year ago do you think they could have
taken out the Uranian leadership
no absolutely not
but what if they did it today today is a
coin
flip today you would actually say you
know what we might disagree too
aggressive and then other other people
would say no that was just aggressive
enough that they had a
come you would never get that
conversation any other time and by the
way that benefit will decrease every day
so every every day that Israel doesn't
take out Iranian leadership is going to
be harder
tomorrow so the ideal situation for
Israel depending on how aggressive
they're feeling is that Iran does Strike
Back if Iran strikes back and they Mak
it a serious
strike all bets are
off so that's how you negotiate I don't
know if I've mentioned that Netanyahu is
smart when you're dealing with a leader
that smart I mean and I'm talking just
raw intelligence you know forget about
policies and preferences and who's left
and who's right if you have that much
raw computing power on on on one
side I would be afraid of that that's a
lot of raw computing power and I
wouldn't want to wouldn't want to be on
the other
team so I remind you I don't support
Israel anymore um because the ADL has
targeted me
and yes of course I know the ADL doesn't
work for Israel of course I know they're
independent but it's not my
problem I can't solve their problem my
problem
is hey if if your friend attacks
me that's how it works right if you
could stop your friend from attacking me
and you don't do
it there we are right don't don't expect
me to solve your problem I'm not going
to solve your problem so problem is the
ADL and so I don't support Israel
because of that I don't think we should
fund them a single penny not a
penny and that's a little bit personal
in my case all
right yeah right so I'm looking at a
comment if Israel took out the Iranian
uh leadership the Arab world would be so
so pretend
mad at least
before
they to
the they've ever seen in their entire
life we've now uh and by the way have I
have I made my
case you got a little H
glitch that's interesting U might have
had a glitch
we're back all right I was just telling
you that
uh this is probably the best live stream
you've ever seen maybe ever will but can
you uh give me a fact check on
this give me a fact check it's uh it's
my
belief that I've proven I run the
simulation based on today's headlines
yes or
no does it seem to you like all the news
was what I wanted it to be today
now if you're new to me I'm always
joking about this or am
I I've never seen the news so perfectly
tailored to everything that I've already
told you and believe and reveals the
endgame I've never seen anything like
this today is today is just
lit am am I wrong I mean I'm having like
a moment here like be before the
show My Moment was I've never I've never
seen the news so right so accurate and
having the right context Etc so quite
remarkable this is quite a day I mean
this is really a remarkable day I don't
know if I don't know if everybody's
going to see it that
way I've never seen anything like it
this this is the day of all days in the
news never see anything like it all
right I'm going to end the uh the
non-subscription platforms so bye to
YouTube bye to rumble bye to X I'll be
talking to the folks here on locals I
understand there's some some kind of
weird time lag so I'm going to say
goodbye but uh I think I have to wait a
little bit before I actually click the
button so it doesn't look like I've
rudely cut you off so what I'm doing now
is completely unnecessary talking from
this point forward there's no point in
you watching this because nothing useful
will happen I'm just calling for about
30
seconds
until how do I know when it's time to do
it well anyway if you watch this part
this was my polite good day and I hope
it doesn't cut
off
what push the right button that would
help local supporters only
engaged not
working all right not
working let me turn it let me just turn
off this feed and see if you stay on on
the other
feed oh it won't
end it looks like that option just
disappeared so yesterday we did it right
so I think I'm I think well actually I
don't know I think all the platforms
yeah all the platforms are live
so for some reason it's not letting me
delete the other ones it's probably
because I have two streams going I cross
streams yeah I've got two devices
running one of them is on locals
independently and then the other one's
going through the rumble Studio I'm not
really supposed to do that so I I think
that's what the problem is so I'm gonna
have to say goodbye to everybody at the
same time I'm going to first uh kill
this feed if I'm pointing at you if I'm
pointing at you right now you're de feat
I'm going to kill and then I'm going to
kill the other one so don't go to the
other one cuz that'll die at the same
time bye for now see you in the man
cave all right and before I go now I'll
tell you tomorrow bye for
now all right it doesn't end the
stream so so I'm going to have to kill
it and reopen it and end this
stream for
