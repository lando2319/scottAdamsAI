hey everybody come on in
come on in it's time it's time for
coffee with scott adams
and this is how you get your day off to
the best possible start
yeah i hope some of you are prepared
because all you need is a copper parker
glass attacker chelsea style canteen
jogger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
and join me even you norway i see you
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
thing that makes
everything better watch it it's
happening now go
oh hello ohio
yes people all over the world streaming
in to become part of the best thing
that's happening
it's the best thing everything else is
bad
now i do believe that we are deeply into
the beginning of
the golden age how do i know we're in
the golden age
look at the news
look at the news there isn't any
there isn't any news there's no war that
just started
there's no new pandemic but the old one
we seem to have a handle on now just
stamping it out
we kind of ran out of news
and you know maybe you don't notice this
so much
but it's my job to wake up way before
you do
and to look at the news and then talk
about it
and there's not much news
now i don't know how much of this is
entirely because
the the news industry has just decided
that there's no news
but uh i don't know what's going on here
but let's let's talk about what is
happening
so just see if you can find out any do
you feel there's any
shift in what the big stories are
all right think about whatever was the
big story one year ago
whatever that is all right something
something trump
pandemic or something right now here's
some of the big headlines today
uh the u.s fish and wildlife service uh
got a shock when somebody caught a
sturgeon
there was uh six foot ten
so almost seven feet long and 240 pounds
it might have been over 100 years old
so there you go there was a fish
it was really big there's your headline
a really really big fish
now the alternate headline could have
been since they tagged it and then
released it
that humans were so bored that they
tortured a giant fish
uh and then threw it back in the order
water but they tagged it
so that the next person who catches it
and tortures it
will know that it had been done before
so it's tagged so that's good
so i'm trying to remember if i talked
about this yesterday
in the comments that this is one of
those
pitfalls that people do and i do fall
into
you can't remember if you thought about
talking about something
or did you talk about it and
it has to do with the fake ufo sightings
you've probably all seen the video of
what you think is the most
credible ufo sighting of all time
and you and you know what it looks like
right it's a uh
some kind of a video from some pilots
who were flying
and they're locked into this object
below them and it was defying
physics and it was flying really fast
and they were all exciting like whoa
whoa what is this what is this thing do
you remember that
and finally after after decades of
ufo sightings that were not credible
finally we got one where
even the military said oh yeah this is
real
this video is real and there we saw a
little smudge
that looked to be defying gravity and
defying physics
how many of you believe that was a alien
spacecraft or
some advanced human-made
how many of you thought that little
smudge was actually a ufo
all right i hope you i hope you remember
that on day one i said to myself
i don't know what that is but that's no
spacecraft
i might be the first person you heard
publicly
you know privately i'm sure sometimes
lots of people said it
but publicly i think i'm the first
person you heard
to say that's not a spaceship whatever
it is it's not that
so i saw a debunk on youtube that i
tweeted out yesterday you can see it in
my twitter feed yesterday
and would you see it pulled apart by
somebody who knows what they're talking
about
it's actually kind of flare kind of
hilarious
somebody says the pilots must be lying
not necessarily
because in order to know that that
object was actually
a bird that's the answer
it was a bird and here's how you know it
was a bird
first of all uh there's one angle when
you if you blow it up
you can see it pulsating because it's
it's just a uh
it's an infrared video so it's only
seeing the heat
and the heat is just the torso of the
bird but you can see it go poop
exactly about the uh the the same pace
that you'd be flapping your wings
so basically it's a bird flapping its
wings
they can do the math and the geometry
based on the information in the video
which tells you the angle of the plane
the direction
the the altitude of the plane and all
this stuff
if you do all the math you find out that
the object is this big
which you can just do from the math
that's presented in the video itself
because around the video it's got all
the the details of
you know direction and speed and
altitude and all that
so you just take the information that's
right on the video do the math
and it comes out to be about this big
and is flying at just about the height
that you would expect a bird
so it flaps its wings it's the size of a
bird
and it's where birds fly
okay somebody says it's the wrong video
i'm sorry
i'm sorry to debunk this for you because
i know you want to believe this
there was a real picture of it of a ufo
but now it looks like it was just a bird
and it was about a foot long and that's
it
that's almost that's the whole story now
all that part about the bird
defying um defying physics
was that the part that convinced you
because all the experts said
there's no way this object could go like
this and then like that
nothing like that well it turns out
that's all perfectly explained
by the speed of the aircraft that
videoed it
so i don't know if i could do a good
example of it but let's say
let's say this pen was your line of
sight from the
plane and the plane is really moving
really fast
and then the camera let's say this is
the camera actually
and then the camera as it's moving is
moving to keep tracking of the object
so it's not just the plane that's moving
but the bird is moving
and the camera is moving and when you
put all of those three things together
and then you isolate on just the object
it looks like the object is moving like
crazy
but it's really an artifact of the
camera and the plane moving
that makes the other thing look like
it's moving but it's just an illusion
so i can't explain it as well as a video
and i forget the name of the person who
did the debunk
but it's uh completely convincing that
that's not real
in other news the dilbert nft the
digital collectible version of a
of the only naughty dilbert comic sold
for
thousand three hundred dollars and the
non-naughty version sold for five
thousand dollars
now here's something you might not know
about digital collectibles
because you say to yourself scott
weren't you expecting to pay more
than 13 300 well i didn't really know
what to expect i was just
you know playing around to see what
would happen
but here's the part you don't know every
time this digital
collectible is resold so now
now somebody won the bid and they will
be the owner or it's already happened i
think
and then they can resell it every time
they resell it
one of the things that a digital
collectible can do
that a regular piece of art for example
cannot do
is that the original creator
gets a cut every time it's resold
so for infinity no matter how many times
it's sold and resold i get a cut
forever and that's a that's a big
advantage over
physical art they can't do that um
have i told you that the big problem
with the the difference between
conservatives and liberals is that
conservatives
put human motivation as a prime variable
in all of their systems and liberals act
like it isn't even a thing
it's not even a variable at all you
don't even need to consider it
here's another example i'll keep giving
you examples until this becomes really
obvious to you
so minneapolis has become a
murderous hellhole they have the second
most
homicides this year that they've had
since 1995.
and in 1995 when they had that many
homicides they were actually nicknamed
the city was nicknamed murderopolis
that's how bad it was
it was named after all the murderers now
which worldview predicted that murders
would go through the roof
was it the liberals who said hey let's
defund the police and that should help
us out
or was it the conservatives who said if
you keep
putting pressure on police police will
pull back and crime will go through the
roof
which worldview correctly predicted
that the way things were going would be
a giant increase in crime
duh the one the world view that
considers
human motivation every time
is it ever wrong as long as human
motivation is the core of why one would
be predicting one way versus the other
the ones who consider human motivation
are going to be right
almost all the time if not all the time
now i'm not saying that every
conservative opinion is right and every
liberal one is wrong
nothing like that i just mean when it's
limited to something that has
as a main variable human motivation
the conservatives are going to get that
one every time
just because they consider it the people
who simply
ignore the biggest variable
are not really going to be good at
predicting
surprise
and so yes so there's murder through the
roof in minneapolis exactly like you
think it would be
big question we all have is how long are
we going to wear masks
i think i told you my prediction that
mid to late
summer i think masking will largely go
away
and it doesn't matter if the government
wants it to go away or not
i think by mid-summer at least in the
united states let's just say the united
states as
our model here i think the public will
reach a breaking point
faster than the government will make a
decision
so in other words i don't think the
government is actually in charge of this
one
so let me say that again the decision of
how long americans wear masks
is no longer a government decision
it was and and i think people quite
wisely
and reasonably listen to their
government in an emergency
because what else are you gonna do right
i mean even if the government's wrong
it's still your best bet most of the
time if it's an emergency
but time goes by and the public gets
educated we know what vaccinations are
we look at the odds we we assess our
personal situation
and one thing that's maybe i don't know
how unique it is but it's certainly a
property of the united states
is that when it comes down to it
you know in the long run the people run
the country
the the citizens run the united states
we don't like to you know if you give us
a choice
hey you citizen would you like to spend
a little more time running the country
you know in addition to running your own
life most people would say
no no no thank you i'll just run my life
let the government run run the
government
the exception comes when the government
can't do the job
there there are some weird kinds of
situations
there are not that many of them really
in which the government is the wrong
person to do the job
wrong entity and the people are the
right entity
and that's this this is exactly that
situation
your government wants to reduce risk to
zero
your government doesn't want anybody to
die
your government wants to take no risks
with your life
do you have a problem with that you
shouldn't
you don't want your government to take
more risks with your life
than you do all right you know it's
there's an average
going on here so it's not every person
has the same risk profile
but you don't want your government to
say yeah take a risk
go ahead i know you don't want to but
yeah we're going to
make you take a little extra risk no
your
perfect situation is your government is
trying to prevent you from getting
killed
and you the free citizen of the united
states is saying
i like that you care you know that's
cool
i'm glad we glad we voted you people in
it's good that you're trying to get
prevent me from getting killed
and now we're going to go a different
way
because the government doesn't get to
make all your decisions
they don't if enough americans enough
citizens wherever you are
if they simply decide to ignore their
government
that's the end of it that's the end of
it
and i and my my opinion is
that the citizens of the united states
on average
somewhere around mid summer mid to late
summer
are going to say we're done you could
imagine situations in which everybody
wears a mask onto an airplane
the airplane takes off and then
everybody in the airplane takes their
mask off and says you
what's what is the airline going to do
go back and land what are they going to
do
are they going to go land and say oops
you took your masks off
we're going to write you all up yeah
maybe the first time
maybe maybe the first one what happens
if happens two times
the second time everybody wears a mask
plane takes off
everybody takes off their mask at the
same time what's the second airliner do
land because they have to they might
have requirements that they have to
it would take about two or three
airlines taking off and landing
before the whole rule would just go away
right so the point is that the
government doesn't run your life
it only runs it when it's credible and
when it looks like it's doing
something that's at least defensible
even if you don't agree with it
and we would reach the point where it's
just not defensible
i think mid to late summer as things are
going so when the tsa
says that they're going to extend face
mask wearing until
september september 13
weirdly specific um
i think that's actually pretty
reasonable
i think the tsa is actually making a
good decision here
because they're going i would say
they're going at least
a month further than i think it needs to
go
and that's just about perfect because
they can always pull back
right they can always say oh we're gonna
make it sooner but they don't want to
make it later
that's disappointing everybody so i
think they game this just about right i
would say we'll see
let's check our predictions everybody
how many times have i told you that if
your worldview predicts the future
well you might have a good worldview
here's a prediction that i made that i
heard exactly
zero other people making sometime about
last year
now do my fact check for me because i'm
going to make a very big claim
and if it's wrong call me out all right
so in the comments call me out if this
is incorrect
i might be the only person a year ago
who told you
that if you're judging the united states
performance on coronavirus
that you're a little bit premature
because one thing that the united states
is good at
is adjusting we are some adjusting
mofos we we will start ugly
and then adjust and if you're judging us
by how we started
you've missed the whole show americans
don't start great
we start which is one of our greatest
qualities
if you if you said what's what's like a
really good quality of
americans you know if you could make
some average
statement about americans a great
quality about americans is that we run
toward trouble
we run toward trouble to fix it
right we we don't wait around
we are very action oriented we just do
stuff
the other thing that americans do is we
don't agree with each other
and we don't take and we don't we
don't just
take everybody's orders just because
they gave us orders
we don't believe our government just
because it told us something
we're very very independent
and very very skeptical
what does that create on day one of a
pandemic
a right you take a bunch of
super
independent skeptical action oriented
people
and you throw them into the first days
of the pandemic
and it's going to be the biggest cluster
 in the world
we're just going to be fighting
disagreeing skepticizing that's not a
word is it
is it skepticizing it should be should
be a word
but give us six months
give us six months give the united
states
nine months and then let's check the
score again
against all you people who put on your
mask and marched in line
how's that working out the united states
is
really good at starting ugly and
figuring it out
it's what we do and so on day one when
we started ugly and other countries seem
to be
maybe locking down more effectively i'm
not even sure if it made a difference
maybe masking more effectively did it
even make a difference i don't know
because we're we're still a little bit
blind about why things happened the way
they did
we still don't exactly know so
um the united states is now clearly
better than
germany france sweden to pick three so
of our peer countries who are sort of in
the same boat on day one we are now
kicking their asses
and i told you that was going to happen
so my world view says we start ugly and
then we win
because that's what we do we just do
that
i don't know why i mean maybe it's
something about the dna of the country
but it's pretty consistent
look at climate change now many of you
are still on the side of
climate change is not real or whatever i
know my audience so a lot of you are
doubting the
the planet is even warming up and if it
is
if it's even bad i'm on the side of it's
certainly warming up
humans are certainly part of it at least
i believe that to be true
and uh but probably the how bad it will
be
is overstated because of this this very
thing
that day one it's a
but then we work it out and that looks
like that's what's happening with
climate change as well
we're all skeptics we don't believe it
we think the government's trying to
you know turn into one world government
we think
every possible uh problem with the data
and we're not wrong on day one but once
once we get a handle on things
you know you're gonna watch a nuclear
power and you're gonna watch
you're gonna watch a lot of things come
together in the last innings
so that's my belief about climate change
is just like the pandemic we will start
ugly
and by the final innings we'll look
great
that's called the golden age
what's the biggest mystery in the world
right now i would say
the biggest mystery in the world is why
no one serious is talking about
the national debt what's going on
do you understand because i really don't
i have some hypotheses i'll talk about
but why was it that the tea party and
you know all serious people even on the
left were saying we can't run up debt
forever
we'll all be poor we're spending money
we don't have
but now when the problem was tiny
we treated it like it was an enormous
problem
but now that the problem is objectively
speaking enormous
we're treating it like a small problem
we don't even talk about it
why is there even anything else being
discussed on the news
because if anything we thought was true
about debt
was actually true then we're doomed
and that would be a big story right
we're all doomed
you'd think that'd be in the news but
take the other position
what if when we thought it was a big
problem even though it was far smaller
what if it was never a problem
and what if it's still not a problem
because
national debt doesn't work the way
personal debt does
you don't have to you don't have to pay
it off
exactly you can sort of inflate it away
just wait forever until it
seems less because of inflation
so what's going on do you think that
there's some kind of
common conspiracy idea among the
leaders who control the media to simply
downplay a problem that's going to kill
us all
and destroy the country is that possible
or how about this hypothesis i saw today
on msnbc
you know msnbc is the racism filter
channel
you take any story and they'll turn it
into a racism story
it's like uh some boulders came loose
and caused a rock slide in montana
turn on msnbc racism causes rock slide
in
montana so there's sort of the racism
filter channel
and they say that the the tea party
was never about the debt what
now this is a hypothesis not they're not
presenting it as fact
it's an opinion and the opinion is maybe
the tea party people were just racists
but they didn't want to say hey we're
all just racists
so instead of complaining about obama
being a black president
they complained about the debt because
that doesn't sound racist
does that sound like what was really
happening
or does that sound like msnbc's crazy
racism filter
that turns every ordinary story about
anything
into racism yeah i'm saying lols
this is actually laughably stupid
opinion
but not on msnbc on msnbc
this looks like a normal like yeah
that's a pretty good opinion there
says we complained about it under
clinton too right yes
i don't know a time when conservatives
were not complaining about the debt
until now because
you know you still hear it you still
hear people tweeting
blah blah debt there are still pundits
on the news who say
blah blah we're running up our debt but
we act as though
it's like it's like a hangnail
where the the way we're acting is in no
has no correlation to what the thing is
and the thing is crushing debt which
according to
everything we've always known should
just destroy the united states
but it's just not even a concern
what's going on seriously i don't know
what's going on
so there are a few possibilities one is
that it was never a problem
and we just figured out that national
debt doesn't act like regular debt
and so we shouldn't treat it that way
maybe
maybe it could be that we've learned
that if you're the strongest economy in
the world you just don't have to worry
about it
if you have the best economy and the
biggest military
maybe what we think about paying back
debt
just doesn't mean the same thing maybe
we think it's china's problem because
they own a lot of the debt
i don't know but i worry that the real
play here
is that it's a massive income
distribution
that the republicans haven't quite
figured out yet
meaning that who's going to pay off the
debt
so right now is it something like half
of the country pays no taxes right
i don't know what the exact number is
something like half the country or more
pays no federal taxes so who's going to
pay off the debt
is it the half of the country that
doesn't pay any taxes today
do they suddenly make a whole bunch of
money magically and now they can help
pay off the debt
no no it's going to be rich people
right so i believe the debt
is just a massive tax on people like me
so i believe that whatever i thought was
my you know accumulated net worth
is probably maybe 25 of that
so probably 75 of my net wealth
will be um in one way or another
reduced to pay this debt and i don't
really get a vote on it it just is sort
of a backdoor way for this to happen
so i think that's what's happening um
but also
i think here's and here's the last
hypothesis
the problem is so big that our brains
can't handle it
that's not a bad hypothesis because
that's what it feels like
it doesn't mean it's true but it feels
like
people are stunned by it meaning that
the problem is so big
and we're so doomed that we just act
like it's not there
you know sort of like a meteor was
plunging toward the earth
imagine if you will we saw a meteor
coming toward the earth and we knew it
was going to destroy the world
what would you do you might wake up and
just do the same thing you did yesterday
even though it's a waste of time because
you're going to all be dead in a week
but i'll bet people would just go to
work
because they wouldn't know what to do
you'd just be stunned by the bigness of
it
maybe that's happening don't know
all right one of the funniest stories in
the
news is jim acosta uh apparently used
the word on the on the air
intentionally
and he called fox news a
factory
and what he was talking about is the
story about
fox news reporting in a number of ways
the biden's plan
for the climate would require you to
have no more than one hamburger per
month
which turned out to be fake news now is
jim acosta wrong
that um in this case fox news was a
 factory
on that story no he was not wrong
and man am i mad at tom arnold
for making me retweet his tweet about
jim acosta
but he's right he just happens to also
be the author of
or one of the authors of the find people
hoax so jim acosta certainly works for a
 factory
uh who is in this particular case
accurately criticizing another
factory
but once the news becomes news about the
news
you're in the golden age if you turned
on the news and a lot of your news
is just the news people talking about
the news people do you know how much
chatter there is now about sub stack
a lot of the news is people in the news
criticizing sub stack which is part of
the news
that criticizes the news it's just the
news talking about itself now
uh here's another prediction i made back
when uh
the election the last election happened
and it looked like uh the
congress was going to be sort of uh you
know close to even on a lot of questions
and i told you that joe manchin democrat
would be the most powerful person in the
country
because he's the only one smart enough
to know that if you sometimes vote
against your party
you get to run the country and i told
you
that joe manchin would probably be smart
enough to figure out
that he could be in charge of the
country without being elected president
and without you know without anything
just by being the one person who's
willing to
to go on either side and sure enough
joe manchin proved it again by opposing
uh
statehood for the district of columbia
which effectively kills it
so did anybody's vote matter
except for joe manchin he's the only
vote that mattered
nobody else can nobody else mattered
there was one person who made the
decision about the
dc becoming a state just one person
joe manchin just like uh
yeah and romney of course uh got booed
in utah
at a gop event imagine being romney
and being booed at a republican event
that's not so good
but yeah i guess that gives romney a lot
of power too although it doesn't look
like romney is using his power
let's say for the country when i look at
joe manchin's decision
and i don't know a ton about joe manchin
but
it does seem to me that when he crosses
party boundaries
it looks different than when romney does
it
because romney looks a little bit like
he's anti-trump
which doesn't really help me but joe
manchin looks like he was just looking
at
what's good for the country and he
figured that the constitution required a
constitutional amendment
that's just an adult decision so good
job
adult decision uh elon musk as you know
will be hosting
saturday night live and again this is
this is telling you the the state of the
world
this is news news
is what you know bill maher says on his
tv show
or what elon musk is going to host on tv
that's the news i mean we're running out
of bad news folks
um so elon asked in a tweet what kind of
skits he should consider
and there were some funny ones
funny ones suggested i suggested
that he should do a skit where he was
interviewing applicants to go live on
mars
given that recently you said that a lot
of people would die
in the in the overall effect the overall
project of getting people to
populate mars people would inevitably
die
which is a fair statement but it would
be funny in that context
but then somebody added on twitter
interviewing people to go to mars but
they get rejected for being too woke
now that would be pretty funny imagine
imagine rejecting people who want to go
to mars
because they're too woke and you don't
want any of that on mars
um somebody else suggested that uh
yolanda skit
in which he's on the joe rogan show as
he famously was
but that he starts out with uh like a
drink or a joint
and as as the interview goes on he goes
to harder and harder drugs
that would be pretty funny i don't know
if they could put that on the air
anyway if that's what we're talking
about we're in good shape
um have you ever noticed that most
criticism is illegitimate meaning that
people start with
i hate somebody and then they criticize
them for some unrelated thing
that most of what you think is a
criticism of somebody's performance
is nothing like that is somebody from
the other team
who doesn't like them for some unrelated
reason who is just criticizing
here's an example in my case i made a
comment about
something in the news it doesn't even
matter for this point
and somebody named elizabeth spears
tweeted this about my comment on twitter
and she said about me she said if this
guy's on your side you may want to
examine your decision-making
so instead of responding to the
criticism
which i used to do i said to myself
huh because the criticism is just stupid
and empty
i thought well who is this person and i
look it up on her profile
and she's the editorial co-founder of
gawker
so the editorial co-founder of gawker
a publication that was so illegitimate
it couldn't even stay in business
they literally got sued out of business
for making up
 and well actually sued out of
business in this case for
the uh hulk hogan's uh stuff showing
that video
etc and other bad business and of course
gawker is also famous
for writing fake news about me
i yeah peter thiel took him out and
so gawker is the least credible and now
defunct
uh publication in the history of
non-credible publications
but if you didn't know that if you
didn't know who she was
that she was a member of one of the
deepest evils of our time
you would just think she had a comment
about me and you would think to yourself
oh
what's wrong with that cartoonist there
must be something wrong with him
somebody
somebody with a blue check is is uh
criticizing him so you always need to do
that now you you can just ignore the
criticism
and just look at what team they're on
and that's the whole story
the criticisms are completely
disconnected
from the actual object of the criticism
and i don't know maybe that was always
the case
um here's another great story on a day
when nothing seems to be going wrong too
much
oh by the way uh there's a story about
north korea
it's giving a little verbal pushback on
biden because biden
said some insulting things so kim
jong-un
is sending out some insults back but
are you worried about north korea
like right now just where you are right
now
your current thinking is north korea
in your top 10 top 20
it's not it's not at all
no trump fixed that
now again check your predictions
who told you on day one ish
of trump and kim jong-un becoming
friends and visiting
who told you that he solved the problem
he didn't just make a first step he
actually solved it
because if north korea doesn't care
about us
that's sort of the end of it right so
i think trump actually permanently
solved
north korea he simply said by the way we
don't care about you
in any kind of aggressive way there's no
way we'd want to
you know invade north korea we just
don't care
let's be friends and i think that's
still working
yeah there's there's a risk that biden
will ruin that
but i'm going to give biden a compliment
because i don't think we should live in
a world in which you can't
compliment somebody for doing something
right if you even if you hate some other
thing they're doing
i do think biden has enough adult
smart people around him that he won't
break
north korea he does have to start out by
a little bit of push which he did you
know a little bit of verbal
you know we'll go this far but not that
far sort of thing
i think he's handling it about right if
he doesn't break it
trump fixed it and maybe he fixed it
forever
there's a story about a virtual creator
on twitch
the streaming platform and uh virtual
means that
it's an animated character but the
person who
who's behind it and the character is
called miko
miko the person behind it is a
is that goes by the name the technician
i love the fact that it's just a person
but the person has a brand
called the technician if that's not
perfect i don't know what is right
um so
the technician uh i guess was fired or
equipped for some tech
job and figured out how to put together
the assets
that would include a a motion capture
suit
so the actual human wears a motion
capture suit and that turns the animated
thing into a moving thing that that
mimics her and sounds like her
and it started out really slow but she
put tons of work into it and now it's
now it's making a lot of money i guess
and she was once a solo operation but
now she has an engineer
an environmental model artist a
character artist an animator
a rigger to help her with development
and now it's like a little operation now
i think that this is actually the model
for what education will become
remember i've told you that everything
you see on video
is like the model t forward version
of what video education and video
entertainment
will become because the first
i don't know decades of video was pretty
much
at least if you don't count movies and
tv it was pretty much a person
and a video and that's it just
a person getting video talking and if
that's what education stays it won't be
very impressive
but if you see that you can build a team
of experts who have different you know
different talents
you can build a quali a product which
just goes through the roof
so education is going to go this way too
there'll be teams of people with
different skills making educational quan
content which is for the most part not
the case right now
and here's what i wanted to say about
this there's a part of the story
where this it's a woman this woman who
started all this
would get up at two in the morning to
start development
and then she would stream from like noon
to 6 p.m or whatever
so here's somebody who was getting up at
2 in the morning
to make this work maybe that's the story
right and roly-poly on
on twitter sent this to me with the the
observation
that this isn't somebody who got lucky
this is somebody who created this
situation for
luck to find her and that it did and
what i mean is
she she went through her own actions and
decisions and energy she created
enough opportunity for some luck to find
her and then it did
all right so i wanted to tell you a
story
that that really goes to this and i'll
connect them in a moment but
years ago i was on vacation with
another family so it was a family
vacation in my
my last life and the
the husband from the other family was
unusually
fit and when i say unusually fit
i mean like walked off the mag you know
the cover of a
fitness magazine fit like just ripped
kind of fitness and of course i always
looked at him and thought to myself
god is that is that genetic like i know
he worked out a lot
but i couldn't imagine that working out
a lot would get me to look any version
of why he looked
and i had this eye-opening encounter
so i went to the gym once while we're on
vacation and he was there at the same
time
so i start out i start by working out
and i look over and i notice he's
working
arms and his arms were unusually
unusually fit and he's working arms and
then i go from
my legs i do my back and my arms and and
i finished my entire workout
so now that i'm done with my workout i
figure well i'll say a few words to him
before i leave the gym
because we've you know been in different
parts but we're friends
and so so i start chatting with him and
i say well you know i'm going to leave
now
and then the entire time i did my entire
exercise every part of my body
including cardio he had been working on
his arms
like because i checked him out every
once in a while to see if he had any
tricks
he was still working on arms after i
said i'm leaving
i'm completely done with my workout he's
standing there and he goes ah what do i
do next
what should i do next and then he goes
i think i'll do arms
and my freaking head fell off
because it's one of those moments when
you realize when you see somebody who's
getting better results
there's a reason the reason he got
better results
is they put in 10 times more work
now i thought to myself wow if i doubled
my workout
i'll bet i could you know maybe get get
in the same kind of
condition he is i'll double my workout i
think i could do that because i'm pretty
dedicated
i'm going to work twice as hard
wouldn't have even been close to get
what he has
or had i assume he still has he just
worked
ten times harder he just spent all of
his time on his arms
oh yeah so since then i learned his
tricks he's also one who taught me about
using uh
smaller weights i'm seeing in the
comments a lot of you saying steroid
steroids but actually no
i knew him well enough to know that if
he had been doing any kind of
supplements
i would know it so he was you know we
were close enough that that wouldn't
have been a mystery to me
in any way but he wasn't it was just
hard work
that's it so when you see this tying it
back to mikko
the the technician and her streaming
success
she got up at 2 am every day
worked on her skill stack and then
worked on her job
and then fell asleep probably exhausted
is her was she lucky it was she lucky
or did she put in so much effort the
luck was going to find her
looks like she put in so much effort and
did it right
built a she had a skill sack effort as
well as just brute force
took a chance took a risk did everything
right and it worked
every once in a while when you see
somebody do everything right
and then it works that gives you a lot
of hope for
yourself doesn't it you just have to do
what you know to do
there was nothing that she did here that
made a
big difference somebody's saying that my
friend probably ate a lot of protein and
i think that is true
i do think he did protein supplements i
don't believe anybody ever
built impressive muscles without protein
supplements this is my belief that i
don't think it's ever been done
if you don't supplement with protein
doing weights is
almost doesn't matter it's actually that
big a difference
yeah you should still do it even if
you're not supplementing but
if you want to actually grow muscles
you can't do it without supplements
in my opinion
uh somebody says maybe she sleeps from 6
p.m to 2 a.m not that complicated
i don't believe there's any case to
somebody who wakes up at 2 a.m
um who isn't a super hard worker and
also has learned that that's when you
can work without being disturbed
because you've got to be really serious
to want to be awake
hours before the rest of the world
you've got to be pretty serious and i
was
if you looked at the effort i put in to
make dilbert work
some of you know this story for the
first 10 years of dilbert
i worked every day from 4am to usually
finishing you know nine at night and i
never took a day off
and i worked on christmas i worked on
thanksgiving at least in the mornings
and so if anybody looks at my success
and they say man a lot of people tried
to become cartoonists
but you know you succeeded i guess you
got pretty lucky
everybody who worked as hard as me was
as lucky as me
now i know i know you don't want to
believe that
but it's hard to find an exception the
people who worked as hard as i worked
but also paid attention to the talent
stack
like like the technician did she built a
whole
you know technical talent stack from how
to do animation
to you know the everything the streaming
you know just tons of talents
if you do those two things get up
earlier than everybody else gets up
work seven days a week for ten years and
build your talent stack
you know logically so that they all work
together
you think you're not going to succeed
you will
probably closer to every time so that is
your
inspirational message for today and
yes somebody said in the comments and i
think that's that's a fair point
that dedication and willingness to work
hard are probably genetic
i don't know what percentage but it
feels more like something i was born
with
than something i acquired over time
but i don't know if you can know how
much you were born with if it hasn't
been
activated by your your actual actions
yeah some people do have the ability to
um put off pleasure
for a greater game i think maybe you're
just born with that
somebody says what actually does this
technician actually do well in
what i'm talking about is the technician
creates a
character called miko that appears on
the twitch
network but what she did before that was
she worked in animation and some
some other job
um somebody saying oh this is susan has
a good comment here she goes
my siblings and i all had great work
ethic
but two of us were more into lifelong
learning
now susan which of your two siblings did
the best
you all had good work ethic but two of
you were into lifelong learning
i can tell you which ones did the best
all right
also having a strong mother and father
yeah i think that does make a difference
uh adam corolla somebody says adam carl
would argue it's not genetic
i would have to hear that argument
because i'm not going to take it
i'm not going to take your word for it
but that's his opinion my own opinion
has been misrepresented so many times
that when i hear a comment of that
nature that somebody else disagrees with
whatever
i think i'd have to see it from him to
take that as a
something i need to respond to
you don't have to put a pleasure you can
take pleasure from your obsession
well if you're lucky but it's hard it's
hard to be that lucky
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
