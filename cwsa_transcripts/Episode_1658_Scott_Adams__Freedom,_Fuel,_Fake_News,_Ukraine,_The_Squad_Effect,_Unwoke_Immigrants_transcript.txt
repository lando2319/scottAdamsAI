good morning and welcome to another
highlight
of your entire existence
it's called coffee with scott adams it's
famous
all over
wherever this live stream is
and uh well you think that's mostly a
terrestrial thing but we don't know if
our signals are being picked up by
extraterrestrials
but one thing we do know
if any space aliens are listening to
this live stream it's also the highlight
of their entire civilization
and let's take it up a notch let's show
those
space aliens what we can do with the
simultaneous sip and all you need is a
copper margarita gossip tanker chill
sustained canteen drug flask a vessel of
any kind not a ufo
not a ufo but a vessel that would hold a
beverage of any kind
i like
coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine the end of the day
it's the thing everybody's talking about
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
oh yeah
well there used to be old saturday night
live
a joke chevy chase
when uh i guess it was uh spain's uh
franco died
and he would do the the fake news and he
would say
and spain's uh francisco franco is still
dead
which was hilarious back in those days
the point is
that what we consider funny
really changes over time
however
i think of that every time i see that
ukraine has not been attacked by russia
and what is your current thinking
in the comments
will russia do a major attack now we all
think they're going to keep the pressure
on and try to annex things or whatever
but will they attack attack
he mostly knows
mostly knows interesting
now
here's what's the most interesting about
this
the news is telling you mostly yes
aren't they
our intelligence agencies our government
are saying any day now any day now
and yet most of you almost all of you
really well over 90
are saying no you don't think it's going
to happen have we reached a point where
the lies of the government are now so
transparent
that they won't have an effect on us
i'm going to talk a little bit about
things that came from the pandemic that
are insanely positive
you know the pandemic is set itself of
course major tragedy
million americans dead six million
globally
i'm not you know taking away anything
from that but with wars of any kind
whether it's war against people or a war
against the virus you end up with all
these unintentional benefits
and wow do we get a few
you know not enough maybe to pay for the
pandemic but
the last we'll talk about that a little
bit so on ukraine
i have this to add
you know how important it is that
the frame or the the way you look at a
problem
will really constrain
your options
in other words if you look at a problem
as
as we often do for these international
things as they only respond to power
or the the other side whoever the other
side is in this case let's say it's
russia they only respond to strength
now
on one level
that's true enough would you agree with
me
would you agree with me that on the
surface level
that's pretty true
that other countries really do only
respond to strength because if anybody
sees an opportunity
they take it
am i wrong
there's no exception to that
any country that sees a national
opportunity
if it has a low cost
they're going to take it
your countries are organized to optimize
what's
what's good for the country
so of course it's true that power is the
primary variable
that keeps things stable or keeps things
unstable so there's no question about
the basic truth of that
however
however
when you reframe things
here's a little uh secret for you
the reframe doesn't need to be
true
it only needs to work
right so what might be true
is that strength is the only thing that
matters
that might be just completely 100 true
and if you were a physicist or a
scientist and somehow you can measure
who has the power and and importantly
who knows they have the power
and who knows they don't
you'd probably be able to predict what
will happen almost every time
but
if you were to reframe the problem this
way
which might be less true
but would it be more effective
and this way is
what do you want
just what do you want
here's a
scenario i imagine now i'm not
hallucinating that this would really
work
i'm just taking you through a thinking
process
if i could spend an hour with putin
and i don't know let's say
amazingly he learned to speak english in
the last week
so we could just have like a
conversation in the same language no no
interpreter it's just the two of us in
the room
and if i could say to him okay look
just tell me what you need
like what do you need
what's in it for you really
is it
is it the pipelines you know and
everything's going to be a little bit
yes
it's a it's a it's somewhat about
national defense
it might be about pride it might be
about momentum it might be about
consolidating leadership over his
country
it might be
writing
past injustices it might be about
returning russia to its former glory
maybe
but over here we're just guessing are we
don't you feel like we're just guessing
because everything depends on just
what's happening
literally in one person's skull area
that's all
just one person
and and what's happening in this little
this little piece of brain
like the the actual chemical reaction
that's happening there that will
determine
the life the life and deaths
of i don't know a million people
that little bit of chemical reaction in
one person's brain and it all depends on
that
so
suppose you put me in the room with
putin now keep in mind
putin is a high-level player
we assume he's very persuasive
to say the least
but so am i
you know in in my own different way
and if i asked him and i spent enough
time with him don't you think i could
find out what the real problem is he
might not say it directly
but alberta would come out
you know maybe not in the first five
minutes but if you could just hang with
him for like an hour
and just talk about all the things
albeit he would reveal even
unintentionally
maybe by the one he talks about the most
maybe by the one he
shows the most uh let's say let's say he
mentions there's a whole bunch of
reasons
but when he mentions one of them he
becomes
more animated
you know when he's talking about it you
can see that that's the one you look in
his eyes you see that's the one that
matters the other ones are all true
but maybe one matters more right just to
the one person
and the one brain and the one skull
in the world
now do you think that you could not
figure out a way to give him what he
wants
whatever that is
the the main thing he wants without
giving up something that you don't want
to give up
i don't know
maybe there is no way maybe it is just
power but as long as we think that the
frame is just power you can't even ask
the right question
because maybe
just maybe
just pick one man what if the only thing
he cared about was selling energy
what if that's the only thing
and otherwise he's not actually that
worried about nato attacking russia
because if you talk to putin would he
really say
i'm afraid of nato attacking
would he
i don't know
maybe he's not i mean nato is
a defensive force by
nature but of course everything
defensive looks a little bit offensive
so
is it is it about
his legacy
suppose you found out that what what
putin wanted more than anything is a
legacy
could you give him a legacy
without giving up too much of what you
want to give up
maybe i don't know maybe not of course
but if we're not if we're not asking
exactly what he cares about and we can't
figure it out how in the world do you
get a good outcome
by luck
or you just let the power go where the
power goes and it doesn't matter who
wanted what or why
it's just the water is going to find its
own level and we're just waiting to find
out what happens maybe that
but i would at least be open to the
question of
what the hell does you want and on top
of that
i had a wild idea
that kind of connects to my
earlier statements about
maybe
publicly interviewing people
which is
can you imagine a better interview than
me interviewing putin
and is it even legal
would that even be legal
and what would happen to me if he said
yes
like if i actually you know put it out
there
and and
he said yes
because
you might
he might i mean he is actually quite
open to
media and by now he knows that
you know podcasters have have some
little weight in the ecosystem
so what if he said yes
would that even be legal
because
i would worry that i would break some
kind of treason law
if i accidentally gave him a platform
where he looked good
that'd be a big problem wouldn't it
so wouldn't i have to make him look bad
to be to be an okay american
you know could i continue being an
american if i made putin look good
accidentally i may be a pretty big risk
wouldn't it
but if i came at it with the intention
of not making him look good
first of all why would he do it
and second of all why would i do it
why would i do it
i wouldn't have any interest in that
right other people can make him look bad
but i would actually legitimately want
to know what the hell he's thinking
and i think i can get out of him
i know you don't
but i actually think i can get it out of
him because i think i can get it out of
anyone
of course it depends on this one thing
which is speculation
that if you knew what he really wanted
it wouldn't shock you or surprise you
that much
that we just need to know what it is
and we don't know which of his several
fairly good reasons for doing what he's
doing we don't know which one is the
activating one but if we did i'll bet we
could figure out something pretty
quickly
and he's also a practical person right
the one we think
would you say that's a fair
characterization
that whatever you think of putin's you
know his breathtaking evil
you would also say he's effective and
you know
you
you know he's the least rational player
uh lex friedman is going to interview
putin
is that true
is that really happening
now that would be interesting um
was lex born in russia
i don't know his background somebody
mentioned that somewhere
your naivety with putin is terrifying
um
let me speak to that
my naivety with putin is terrifying now
whoever is saying that i'm naive about
putin
the the assumption built into that
comment which by the way is completely
correct
i'm not disputing your characterization
if you're saying that i'm completely
naive about putin that's actually my
point
that's my point but i'm saying that we
all are
that's the whole point
so if you're saying scott you don't know
anything about putin you're following
correctly
that that's the point we don't know what
he's thinking
now if you don't think i could get it
out of him
then maybe you don't understand the
tools
of persuasion
but i think somebody with my
same
type of training and experience probably
could get it out of him
right you would just have the right kind
of person with the right training doing
it it's not something that could be done
accidentally you know i don't think
i don't think stephen colbert could get
it out of him
i don't think a typical news person
could get it out of him
but i think i could and i think i could
do it in public and i don't think he
would be worse off for it
i don't
not necessarily
overconfidence you say
that's my trademark
overconfidence is exactly where you want
to be
let me ask you this this is actually an
interesting question if you had a choice
of three choices show me in the comments
you could be
underconfident
compared to your actual abilities
you could be exactly the right amount of
confident
or you could be overconfident
which would be your optimal
situation
i see a lot of people saying over
so
uh what's interesting about your what's
interesting about your criticisms of me
this morning
is that they're true but they're they're
more like compliments
or it was more like agreeing with me
but what happened to the real
professional trolls they did disappear
didn't they
because you're seeing the people who
uh
are actually just regular people making
comments this sounds like this doesn't
even sound like trolls
it sounds like actual regular people
just making comments
did something happen with the the paid
trolls
because some other people noted it but i
think it might be confirmation bias or
it might be what topics i'm talking
about on any given day but it feels like
all the trolls just disappeared all the
same time
i i went from complete troll infestation
that lasted
i don't know a month or more
i mean just really high troll content
and then just went to zero
did twitter do that
it's possible twitter did it it just
turned off the trolls maybe
i mean they have they do have the
technology that if somebody stays
trolling long enough they're going to
get flagged right
so it could be that there was a wave of
trolls that signed up and then uh
twitter wiped them off and it takes a
while for them to ramp up again could be
that who knows
anyway
um
another big breakthrough in fusion
we keep hearing these and this time it's
uh um
and by the way i had to predict this and
i think i'd predict this in my book
loser think
can anybody confirm this a few years ago
i was saying that ai and i didn't make
this up i'd read it somewhere the ai
would be the thing that made
fusion
energy practical
so it turns out that that's exactly what
looks like what's happening so google's
alphabet
part of the company there
is that the right way to say it or is
alphabet its own spin-off now so
how do you say that but anyway alphabet
whatever the hell that is something
about google
um
the scientists at deepmind which is part
of that
umbrella organization
they figured out how to use a ai to
control a fusion reaction which requires
thousands of
micro
corrections per second
so the ai
can look at this big
complex ball of
fusion and by the way don't let me get
too technical here i i know i'm going
really deeply so there's this big ball
of fusion
that's going in lots of directions and
doing lots of things
and a human engineering it could never
anticipate
all the things that fusion reaction
could do
in any given second so humans can't do
it you can't engineer something to do
but ai
can watch it and learn
so they they do the reaction they turn
the ai on and they say okay ai figure
out how to control this thing
and then the ai
mostly through trial and error
figures out how to control fusion
that actually happened
like they actually trained in ai
to go figure out how to make a fusion
reaction work and it worked
now the ai only did the one part of it
which is keeping it stable apparently
but it worked
do you know how big a deal that is
real big
like real real real big like really big
it's about as big as anything's ever
been in the history of humankind
did i oversell that
i i think i don't think that's an
overstatement
that if this ai solution for keeping the
fusion stable
if it's what it looks like and of course
you know anything could be different
than the way it looks in the news
but if it's what it looks like
this could be the key
the key element
to unlocking fusion
we might be pretty close
here's another thing that trump was so
right about
trump's approach was sort of a business
person's approach to energy
that a country that has a strong energy
base or policy or production
is always going to be in the best shape
it's just a basic rule of thumb
that if you have the best energy
business producing business
you have the best economy like
everything works from that cheap energy
blah blah blah
but here are some of the things that
happened once trump's you know
pro-energy policies were replaced
immediately by bidens stop all the
carbon because of climate change stuff
so
certainly we lost jobs certainly it
affected the gdp
what biden did which of course affects
the tax base which of course affects
funding for schools and everything else
we we hoped to decrease the carbon use
because of climate change but it
increased it
apparently a major coal company had its
best year ever
or in many years
the coal companies were just killing it
coal companies had reduced by
50 percent in terms of how much energy
they were producing for the country they
had gone down by 50 percent
and a lot of that was because the
pro-energy policy of trump and and
before that
um
made gas more competitive so you didn't
need coal
natural gas
and so now that that's been reversed
more coal has been burned so biden got
us more coal fewer jobs
lower gdp less tax base for schools
we end up with less stable power
of course the high price of all forms of
energy causes inflation
and then we also lose our international
leverage
if if fuel were cheap
americans would be paying low prices
our economy would be better but russia
would have a lot less money to amass an
army on the border of ukraine
basically almost everything good
comes out of a
strong energy economy
try to come up with an exception
can you think of an economy that has a
a strong uh energy base
that isn't doing better than its peers i
know now you're gonna have to adjust
this for you know whether it's nigeria
you know make it an african standard
versus you know etc
but
i feel like it's a one to one isn't it
pretty close
that energy equals good life
well russia
russia is an example of energy being the
only reason they have the lifestyle they
have
isn't it
if you took energy away from russia it
wouldn't even be a
you know
it wouldn't be anything
there wouldn't be anything there at all
because they couldn't fund the military
they would just be this broken military
broken nuclear power and we would be
talking about how to how to give aid to
russia so they don't collapse and lose
control of their nukes
basically it's a good thing that russia
has energy because that's what keeps up
a stable country which allows them to
control their nuclear arsenal
you don't want you don't want russia to
fall apart
that would be pretty dangerous
all right
so i'm not sure if people quite
understood the ramifications of uh
biden's leadership there
so yesterday i experienced my uh most
let's say
uplifting experience of
freedom and most crushing
feeling at the same time
so i went to the gym yesterday
where i've been massless for a while
while other people wore masks a lot of
them did
but
now i don't think that the osha has
changed the state the rules yet but for
all practical purposes everybody was
massless
except
well let me do the first part first
walking into my gym and seeing the full
faces of pretty much all of the patrons
was exhilarating
now i know i know lots of you have just
always been there since the beginning of
the pandemic but for those of us who
have not been free
to walk into a room full of happy people
exercising
without masks
made me cry
honestly i mean i actually teared up it
was beautiful
and
and it made me feel for the first time
that we got past this thing
and then
i noticed that the staff were wearing
masks
am i right
do i even need to finish this
the staff
are still wearing masks now i believe
that they have the option
i was told that they didn't have to wear
them but it didn't look like anybody was
taking the option
meaning that
there was some
indirect pressure that the staff for
wearing masks now i offered to help i
offered to talk to management and see if
i could get them unmasked but you know
people don't want to cause trouble
so i mean i asked i asked one of the
staff members i knew well can i do
something about this for you you know
could i talk to somebody because they
would listen to the members
of the gym before they would listen to
the staff unfortunately
and
and then you start seeing the pattern
and the pattern is truly troubling
and the pattern is that the freedoms are
coming back in the exact order of your
power in society
rich white people got their power back
first
and you know magic johnson i guess
so
if you were an elite i guess it didn't
matter so much your race but if you were
elite
and rich
you were already on a private plane
you already could be the governor and
take your mask off
the rich got there first
and i walk into my own my own health
club and of course i'm already the elite
because you know who can even afford to
be a member of a gym really
it's not
what percentage of the public can even
afford that it's not a lot
so i'm already in this elite situation
and then i look at the the staff
still wear a mask and it's just crushing
it's crushing
it just feels so freakin wrong
and watching the kids
go to school in their masks
the the weakest part of society we
protected the worst
and we did that at the beginning too
the the most vulnerable
we didn't we didn't protect them did we
not as well as we should have in
retrospect but did we learn anything
well i don't know
maybe that's why we're being extra
protective of the kids
because the feeling that we failed
early in the pandemic maybe i don't know
but
um
we this is a wake-up call isn't it
why
remember earlier where i was saying that
the only thing that matters in
international relationships is power
that seems to be all that mattered when
it came to freedom
it only mattered how much power you had
the kids don't have any power
if the kids had power they would be
first
am i am i right
if the kids had the power they would
have been the first to unmask not the
last if the prisoners had the power they
would be the first not the last if the
truckers had the power
if the retail workers had the power if
the service workers of america if the
server at your restaurant had the power
they would have unmasked first but they
don't
and if you think if you think your work
is done
because your mask is off well you suck
basically you suck
we got to get these people unmasked
all right you gotta we gotta keep the
pressure on
because the the great claw back isn't
gonna happen on its own right
we're gonna have to
just claw
to
to get back to where we were and i had a
terrible feeling yesterday that my own
problems were solved
you know what i mean like okay i don't
have to wear a mask anymore i guess my
own problem is solved but wow
that hurts when you see somebody else in
a mask it hurts
so that's where i'm at
but in terms of the good things that
came out of the pandemic joy behar says
she might continue to wear a mask in
public at all times
and i say to myself well i didn't see
that coming
but that does seem like a little bit of
a plus
i wouldn't discount that
we also got a lot of touchless purchases
that i really enjoy
retail is easier
right
retail is probably easier forever
because we got you know better ways to
pay for stuff touchless self-check
counts you know grew delivery of
everything
you know we just got hooked on
everything being delivered that's
probably good in the long run
all right rasmussen as bold says if
elections were held today
in the sort of a generic midterm
election type thing
that uh
50 percent of voters would prefer a
generic republican and only 37 percent
a generic democrat
a 13 difference
now keep in mind that there are more
democrats than there are republicans
so if 50 would already vote republican
just generically speaking
the democrats are just
they're dead
they're gone
and you know what the
and you know this of course is what i'm
going to call the squad effect has
anybody given this a name yet
probably somebody already came up with
that name maybe i read it somewhere
but it feels like the squad effect
doesn't it
like the squad became the
the public face of the most progressive
ideas
and
then they
they got
their way at least in some stuff it has
shocked people everything from critical
race theory to
um
you know
women's sports being affected by trans
rights stuff
and
suddenly
um there there does seem to be a
little bit of a pushback here but here's
the weirdest thing
apparently there's only one thing that
can stay to save
moderate democrats
there's only one thing do you know what
it is
only one thing
can save
the let's say traditional classic
democrats
i guess if you say it yet
trump
now maybe desantis too but the but the
point is
the only thing that can get rid of the
progressive
power within the democrat base is to get
wiped out
is to just have all the democrats just
get wiped off the map in in 2022. and it
looks like that's what's lining up to
happen
now anything could happen right i'm not
sure i would even make it a prediction
at this point because you know there
will be scandals and surprises and
god knows what between now and then you
know we didn't see the pandemic coming
either
so
predicting is a hard business
but it's this weird situation where the
only thing that can save the standard
democrats
is trump
or
somebody who has a trump-like approach
to things it could be desantis or
somebody else
right it's kind of weird isn't it but am
i wrong
am i wrong that privately democrats are
saying the only way we can
only way we can get back to what we want
is to get rid of the progressives and
the only way you can get rid of the
progressives is to show that their ideas
of defunding the police and
you know critical race theory and some
other stuff just got you slaughtered
it's the only way there's no way there's
no other way out and that's that's that
power thing again
you know just follow the power
and the power seems to be lining up in
one direction at this point
all right um
here's a uh
here's a little uh predictions last
observation that is just fun to me
how many of you have any kind of a close
relationship
with either uh brand new or pretty
recent um immigrants from the southern
border
yeah just in the comments because i live
in california so for me it's just part
of the normal living environment you're
just you're just always having contact
so some yes
now so for those of you who have
close contact experience i'm talking
about people
if you regularly have conversations with
people whose
you know uh
immigration status you don't quite know
which is very common in california right
it's everyday experience
so
here's what i think about the recent
immigrants
they are the most unwoke people in the
united states
am i wrong
anybody disagree
that the recent immigrants
are the most unwoke
in the united states and it's not as not
because they're exactly like
republicans or something
i'm not saying that
i'm saying they literally do not care
let me ask you this
if i described a following person
you tell me what party they're probably
in
they're very religious they believe in
god
christians
very christian
and they're not just religious but it's
like it's really baked in it's it's an
important part of their life
they're big on family
super big on family
right
and work
is their guiding principle go to work
stay on a jail
get an education
who did i just describe
once you see it you can't unsee it right
all right let me let me just check see
if something's blowing up here
um
so
i can't even describe my life sometimes
all right um
so what happens when all of the unwoke
immigrants
start getting uh more political power
let's say the the second generation is
born have the democrats accidentally
gotten the short-term advantage
because if the census counts the
immigrants it might give more power to
democrat states or something something
like that
or democrat regions or something so
there might be some short-term gain
but it looks to me like
uh the democrats have opened up the
spigot
to let in
a lot of future conservatives
am i wrong
those of you who have actual direct
personal contact with the immigrant
community
can you back me up on that they're the
least
they care the least about any of the
woke stuff
i've never even seen an immigrant being
be
let me say something that will blow your
mind
in all my life in california
with you know i've owned two restaurants
right so you know that my
you know my contact has been high i've
never met
any immigrant a recent immigrant
legal or illegal it doesn't matter the
status
i've never met a recent immigrant
who is ever offended
by anything
anything
have you
has anybody had a different experience
they just don't care about any of that
stuff they just don't care they want a
job
you know they want to get along
want to improve their life
but they do not get offended i've never
i literally have never seen anybody who
was a recent immigrant be offended about
anything
they just want to work they just want
you know the
they want the tools of life that's it
that's all they want
all right and i had missed i guess the
significance of this story about the san
francisco school board uh recall
where three members got uh recalled
because i guess they were
too woke and uh even san francisco which
is the locust of the woke places decided
that's too woke
do you know what the uh the subtext of
the story is
the part that
might get mentioned in the sentence
toward the end of the story
do you know what they left out of the
story
who do you think was the largest energy
behind getting rid of the wokeness
probably
the asian-american community
it's reported that that way and i would
also assume
now
and also i would imagine that would
include a lot of recent
citizens you know recent immigrants
maybe second generation
but you see where i'm going with this
right
pretty conservative the the asian
american uh public has been the most
silent segment of the country in my
opinion would you agree
well i guess if somebody's more silent i
can't think of them to even mention them
but um
they seem to have decided to you know
uh use their power and they used it very
in let's say uh in a surgical way they
just reached in and just took out
three cancers
from the larger body and just removed
the cancer it looks like so good job
to parents in san francisco but the
story i missed the part that i com
for some reason i just didn't notice it
was that they were recalled by votes of
like 79
75 and 72 percent
oh my god
nothing wins by that kind of margin
right
silent on project veritas i don't know
anything about project veritas recent
is there a recent project veritas thing
anybody
somebody's asking me why i'm silent on
project veritas
is there something happening
fda oh is there an fda thing did it
happen today or yesterday i didn't see
anything in the news today
it's two to three days old
wow
has has social media suppressed that
because that's the kind of content that
people send to me immediately
wow all right
i i don't want to alarm you
but what are the what are the odds that
social media and the news could have
kept that story from me for two days
do you see what's happening here right
i i'm about as plugged in as you could
possibly be
to that part of the world you know the
world that wants to doubt all that stuff
how did i not see that because that
never came up in anything i saw
usually it's a
normally if there's a project veritas uh
dump
i would get it i would get like 50 of
them within an hour people would just
send it to me over and over again
wow
that's blowing me away a little bit all
right i'll tell you what i'll do i'll go
look at it i'll go take a look at it
and i'll let you know
but if you're if you were thinking that
i had uh i had some kind of intention
for not talking about it
that's not happening
i didn't even know what that was
now are the what are they what's the
gist of it
is the gist of it that the numbers
are fake or that there's more danger or
something
is that the gist of it
um
oh the young man mandates
all right well
i'll go take a look at that
but uh glad you brought that to my
attention
uh elon musk has new rocket engine in
his rocket company there
and he's going to get it below 10
million dollars per rocket i don't know
if that means per launch
is it under 10 million per launch or
under 10 million 10 million per rocket
either way it's a small number isn't it
i mean that's that's a pretty big deal
so if you look at just what's happening
with fusion plus what elon musk is doing
with the economics of space travel
because it's a big the new rocket is way
way more efficient apparently
it's a big deal
meanwhile over on cnn they can't uh they
can't quit on trump so they're
resident hitman
stephen collinson
uh he's got he does a walls or closing
in kind of uh article about trump every
every week or so for five years
the walls are closing in i don't know if
he uses that phrase but that's the
essence of it and today's story is about
um
so this is how steph and colin collinson
an opinion person on cnn
frames his discussion of trump's legal
woes up until now
okay
so here's how it's framed this is his
actual sentence he goes quote and in all
of the latest legal threats currently
facing him the former president is yet
to be proved guilty
yet to be proved guilty
how about no evidence of a crime
or or how about no court has ever found
him guilty of anything
what's this yet to be proven guilty
stuff
yet to be proven guilty
doesn't that pretty much indicate that
it's just a given that he's going to be
proven guilty well but not yet
but he's coming
have you killed anybody not yet
are you guilty of terrible sexual
offenses
not yet
did you cheat on your taxes
not yet
not yet doesn't mean no
it's amazing
how much propaganda can be slipped into
an opinion piece
and then i guess the uh cnn's just
creaming itself over the fact that
ivanka and don jr
will testify under oath in the new york
state
or new york city case that has something
to do with trump and taxes and
valuations but we don't have any
evidence that there's any actual crime
like none
no evidence whatsoever in the public
anyway the public has no evidence
whatsoever of any crime
and it's big news that ivanka and don jr
will testify
do you know who i'm not worried about
testifying
is ivanka and don jr
i don't think that that's exactly where
all your smoking guns
are going to be discovered
i mean
there are only two possibilities either
there's something to hide and they would
be good at hiding it or there's nothing
to hide and that's the end of it
or they don't know anything that that
would be damaging
so
this is about as far away from trump as
in danger as anything i've seen but i
suppose anybody who's under oath
you know has some risk involved with
that
um but that seems like an artificial
risk that's put on them by the by the
legal system as opposed to a risk caused
by any behavior of the trump
organization
so keep that clear
and then there's a story about uh
trump's accountants who did his taxes
quitting because they can't stand behind
their their accounting job
and then people are trying to read read
between the lines
do all of you know that the accountants
are never responsible for the raw data
that's given to them by the company
that's always been the case
all right so the accountant is always
free from
blame if if a client gave them bad
information and then they did the taxes
based on bad information
but
um
i think this just looks like a cover
your ass situation
i don't think any accounting firm wanted
to take the heat
of defending trump in this context
and i think they said something that's
just always true
do you know it's always true
that your accountant can no longer stand
behind your accounting job that's always
true
so it looks like it's news
like there's there's some kind of a
statement
um
and
uh
anyway
so i'm sorry that just threw me off my
game for a moment so anyway my point is
there's no such thing as an accountant
firm that stands behind stands behind
the numbers
accountant firms only stand behind the
treatment of the numbers
in all cases
so
so it was fake news
because they announced something that's
just business as usual that we don't
stand behind our
are
they don't stand behind the statements
because they don't know if the data that
they got is true
that's just always true
it's always true with every client
all right
how would you like to see
um
the secret to reality
would you like to have reality explained
now you've heard probably
that um so i don't have a hard quit time
today
so you've heard probably
that uh one of the the big problems with
either the simulation or with the idea
that god started the universe or the big
bang is what happened before that
right so if you could come up with a
theory
they handled what happened before
that would be a big advantage for
explaining reality right
and you'd also have to explain the
simulation and you'd have to explain god
you'd have to explain physics you'd have
to explain the big bang
and
here's a little starting point for you
here are three things that are the same
heat
energy
and
statistics
it's just all the same thing
because wherever there's more energy
there's more heat
because coldness is the opposite of
energy right it's the opposite of any
energy
so wherever there's energy there's heat
but wherever there's energy there's also
luck in other words statistics
follow energy
if you go to a city where lots of stuff
is happening
your odds of getting a good job are
better
right your odds of being lucky in a in a
high energy situation or better they're
just more opportunities happening all
the time if you go to the country and
there's one employer and they don't like
you
there's not much energy there
not much odds no there's no no chance
for luck to happen
now
how much energy was there during the
singularity the moment before the big
bang
if when the whole universe was
compressed into
some impossibly small space i guess
how much was possible
and the answer is nothing
at the moment that no nothing was moving
because everything was compressed
there should have been no possibility no
heat no energy
because nothing was moving
so
how do you explain all of that with the
model
now here's another little twist i'm
going to throw in here
do you know that there's no such thing
as time
einstein would back me up on this
there is a thing called space-time
meaning that time has no meaning
unless you're looking at it in
relationship to other things and their
positions
in space
so if space itself changes in other
words if two things change in
relationship to their distance or
you know velocity or any other way in
relation to each other
time is said to have passed but it's
really a change in space
so it's sort of that space time thing or
really all just the same thing
so in the way that energy and
luck are basically
two ways to talk about the same thing
space and time
are actually just two words to talk
about essentially the same thing
things moving in relationship to other
things
let's put it all together simulation
theory
god
big bang
how do you start when there could be no
beginning
infinity
and all the rest
well you start with really scratchy
handwriting
and i say imagine imagine reality
looking like this
a mobius strip do you know what a mobius
strip is
basically it's
uh just for
let's say just for description purposes
so i'm not saying there's a physical
mobius strip in space somewhere
but for conceptual purposes imagine that
space and time
are circular or just to make it more
sciencey
it's it's something where if you start
here and you keep going you end up in
the same place
so i could have drawn a circle but this
looks more like sciency
or science fiction
so
imagine
what happens um
what happens after the big bang
after the big bang
all right so so far i've i've explained
time
and infinity
and we've explained how there could be a
beginning
because it's illogical that anything has
a beginning because there has to be
something before that
but if space and time are in a loop
any kind of a loop
then you don't ever need a beginning
because it can just loop
it just is what it is it just sits there
as a loop and needs no beginning
but you might say to yourself
where'd this come from
well maybe it came from a higher level
simulation
because if anybody creates a simulated
world that thinks is real
eventually that simulated world will
also evolve
until they can make its own simulation
so in theory the simulations go all the
way down
every simulation will make another
simulation to infinity so there
shouldn't be one of these
there should be something closer to an
infinite amount of them over time we
don't know if that's happened yet
now how do you explain the fact
that the big bang was supposed to create
a situation where the gravity
because everything has gravity
would eventually slow the expansion of
the universe
and then it would close back in itself
and create the big bang again that's
what the scientists say
but then when they looked at the actual
expansion of the universe they found out
the expansion was increasing
instead of decreasing the gravity was
supposed to stop the expansion and then
suck it back together over a gazillion
years
but it's getting it's actually
increasing so what happens if all the
matter in the universe
continues
for trillions of years to expand
all right think of it in terms of not
energy
but in terms of the odds
right remember because energy
is really just another way of saying the
odds wherever there's the most energy
there's the most possibility
so at the moment of the big bang there
were no possibilities
as soon as one thing changed
you know hypothetically if one thing
changed in that solid nothing moving
world could that one change have made
everything unstable
and blown up
into the entire universe now once the
universe is as let's say 14 or 15
billion years old
what happens to the odds of anything
happening
they start getting really good
so suddenly you went from the
singularity where nothing could happen
and the odds of anything happening were
basically zero
to something happened maybe you could
call it god if one particle changed in
the singularity and that was all it took
to blow it up
you would call that a god particle would
you just something that happened that
shouldn't have happened and nobody can
explain it one particle got anna and a
whack and boom universe
now as soon as the universe is big you
go from no possibility when it's a
singularity to lots of possibilities
there might be aliens on other planets
we might be inviting inventing fusion
lots and lots of possibilities but now
let's play it in a few more trillion
years
in a few trillion years
will there be more energy
in any given part of the universe or
less well if everything's flying apart
do you get to the point where
everything's cold and dark and dead
and all the possibilities die again
because if you do
maybe you don't need to get all the way
back to a singularity maybe just all the
possibilities are exhausted
and we when you get back to a situation
where all the possibilities are
exhausted again
maybe it just starts over
it's always darkest before the dawn
so
one model of reality
is that there are a whole bunch of
looped realities so there's no
beginnings and no ends each of these
loops is created by a higher level loop
which does imply
there's one original
one original species
but i'm not sure it has to
because could it be that the original
species is also looped
could it be that
there is nothing to anything except
the odds expanding and contracting
could it be
that the heartbeat of reality is nothing
but
a multi-trillion-year heartbeat in which
we start with nothing is possible
it expands to everything is possible and
then here's the magic part
the moment everything is possible
nothing can happen
yeah would that do to your brain
the moment everything is equally
possible
nothing can happen
and that's the singularity again
so there should be a natural heartbeat
to the odds of anything happening from
zero
all the way to everything and then
instantly back to zero
and then back to everything now how it
how it gets out of the
nothing is possible
would have to be god
right so in this model god is the odds
god is the possibility
that you could go from nothing is
possible do everything is possible
so god could be the smallest change
the smallest change
in this stable singularity and it just
blew the whole thing up for trillions of
years now if you if you looked at it on
the smallest scale you would say if
that's all god is it's just like
it's like one little god particle or
it's a muon or some damn thing we
haven't discovered yet and all it did
was tweak
it just went from no possibility to boop
it just moved and the whole thing blew
up
if that's what happened
then god would be both the smallest
thing in the universe in terms of the
smallest
initial action
and also the biggest
it would be everything and everywhere
all the time
this thing called god
under that model
now
this allows your traditional god and all
its beliefs because you might be on a
you might be on a loop where your
religion is exactly
correct for all you know
um but other people could be on other
loops
so
i believe this answers all of your
questions and let's see if i've lost
anything else um
oh
it's also the only theory that predicts
that the universe will keep expanding
traditional science has to throw in uh
correct me if i'm wrong about that but
doesn't traditional science have to
throw in
dark matter
to get the expansion so basically you
have to make make believe there's an
invisible thing or else the math doesn't
work
dark energy yeah dark energy i'm sorry
not dark matter
i've solved the meaning of life that is
correct and so
would you also like to know
what a soul is
let me tell you
and this model
a soul
is
what happens if your life has a ripple
effect that affects other people
because any change to anything will
change everything forever or it'll
change forever like a ripple through
time
even the smallest changes we know that
so when people die they really the the
thing you call grief
i like to say is them incorporating
their energy or the information that
mattered from their life into their
survivors
and they feel that as grief but
basically they're just merging
with somebody else's soul essentially
and taking that forward so that's one
definition of a soul
and
the the other definition of a soul would
be some higher level
uh entity that's managing your your
avatar
all right um
and that
is all i have for you today
so
all right i need some feedback
was this interesting
you don't have to believe it by the way
i'm not trying to sell you on believing
it
so i i should get uh
i should get a uh
lots of
lots of extremes this is usually the
kind of material where people either
hate it or love it
word salad alert
yeah you know
that's not a rom-com
what's funny about all of the criticism
today
is that it's all on point
i don't know if you've noticed that yet
but like almost every criticism anybody
said about what i've said today or who i
am or what i'm doing they're all on
point
like i have a defense for them like well
it's not as bad as you think or whatever
but they're not wrong
not wrong somebody said that this was
word salad and to some extent
language
language restricts you so much that you
really can't get out of the word salad
when you're when you're on this topic so
i mean that's actually a completely
reasonable criticism
uh for those of you who like this sort
of stuff
you want to look for my book called
god's debris
it's not this exactly but if this
content you found interesting that's the
book that would spin your brain
all right and that is all i have for
today i will talk to you on youtube
tomorrow
