good morning everybody it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams
yeah yeah you made it to the right place
you made it on time
or if you're watching this on replay
it's still the right time there's never
a wrong time for coffee with scott adams
it's the best part of your day by far
and all you need to make it
even a little bit better is you need a
cup or a mug or a glass of tango chelsea
just tied a canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's famous all around the world
watch it happen right now and yes
this is live unless
you're watching it later go
yes so good
so good don't feel bad about a little
bit of slurping
now i don't know if you've noticed this
but the way i try to run
my live streams is
not so much like a show you know where
i'm presenting and
and you're just listening i try to i try
to do this more like
uh i'm your virtual friend and we're
just having a conversation over coffee
but for some reason you can't get a word
in edgewise
so you undertalking me is sort of in the
comments
but here's the answer to why and i i
feel like i need to answer this because
a lot of people have suggested
that i should use a software like obs
and i think there are several others
that will take any
live stream and send it simultaneously
to different platforms
um okay
give it a little thumbs up to that
message that just came in there
um so if you've if you've noticed
the way i run this is that i try to make
it as personal
as possible you get me literally before
i've shaved
you know i i haven't i haven't even
changed my clothes i haven't showered
i'm wearing my pajamas you you see me
in the morning you almost always see me
wearing what i woke up in
now um i'm borrowing this technique
from the makeup videos on youtube
have you ever watched any of the makeup
stars
where they literally just sit in front
of a camera and they
as they put their makeup on sometimes
they'll be giving you a lesson about the
makeup
but they'll be just talking about their
life
and you say to yourself well i don't
think i want to watch a makeup show
but you would be surprised how well they
execute
you know their their business model and
it just feels like you're having a
conversation with a person
so if you feel lonely or something you
just put it on
and it's like having a friend who's just
chatting with you live
so
so i'm your virtual friend
and uh you should think of me that way
so the reason i don't use those uh
softwares that
uh broadcast to multiple platforms is
that they
introduce a delay so i see a delay
in my own picture as i'm looking at
myself because i see myself the same way
you see me
but also there's a little delay in the
comments
uh which i find off-putting it doesn't
connect me with the audience as much
so when i'm doing this i have the
weirdest
kind of relationship with this if i were
doing this recorded
i would be talking to a machine and i'd
be talking
and here's my presentation and the
people who on locals who watch me do the
micro
lessons where i do record those i have a
presentation style
which i don't think is nearly as
interesting as
more of a you know
more of a let's say unfocused personal
style
and i think they both have a place but
that's why i don't use those
kinds of software people have been
asking me that
all right let's start with some fake
news
uh have you heard of mediaite
so some people actually sat around
someday in the past and they came up
with this idea for a publication
and when they came up with a name for it
somebody must have suggested the name
mediaite
and everybody else said how do you spell
that they're like m-e-d-i-a-i-t-e
and people looked at it and said but are
people going to have trouble pronouncing
that
well they say media i eat
media height
well anyway the people who named it are
as dumb as the people who write for it
and they've got a little fake news here
about charlie kirk
and here's the headline the headline on
mediaete
is uh charlie kirk engages in insane
speculation
that more than a million people have
died from vaccines
now before i even tell you the details
do you think that happened here's your
first test
for fake news if the moment you read the
headline
you say to yourself but did it
can you ever ask yourself that question
says charlie
charlie kirk engages in insane
speculation
more than a million people have died
from vaccines
if the first thing you think to yourself
is but did he
did he did he
i mean really did he
do i have to even tell you the details
to tell you this didn't happen
let me tell you what did happen which is
close enough to this
that you can see how they came up with
the headline but it's still fake news
what he did say is that the so-called
vares
or however you say it database it's the
one where all the
vaccination bad reports come in so
anybody who thinks that they might have
been
hurt with some side effect from a
vaccination
can report it to this database but the
database is not meant to be
an accurate database the database is
meant to capture
every speculation of well i don't know i
had the vaccination on tuesday
i had a you know this problem on
thursday
can't say one caused the other but i'm
reporting it
so that you know the medical community
if it sees a pattern
you know maybe everybody two days later
had some similar problem that would mean
something
or if a lot of people did so what
charlie kirk was saying
is that the vares database is so
inaccurate
that you wouldn't know the difference if
a million people have had
problems with the vaccinations or if
you know 100 000 or if 5000. so his
point was
that the vares database is
potentially wildly inaccurate
now is that exactly the same as quote
uh insane speculation that more than a
million people have died from vaccines
those are not the same those are not the
same
talking about how inaccurate the
accounting is
is not speculation that a million people
die they're just not the same
so fake news from media
ait uh rasmussen has a
poll i think it's coming out this
morning saying that it was it was asking
if people thought that most
black people are racist do people think
that most white people are racist
and do people think that most hispanic
people are racist
and the good news is
that most people think most other people
are not racist sort of good news right
that if you actually ask him hey
do you think most do you think most
white people are racist
that even the black population says no
no not most of them right so the good
news is
that when we we look at our uh our
i was going to say fellow citizens but
is that sexist
when we look at our other citizens we
mostly think they're not racist
so that's good news right is it
but is it but is it
here's the counter to that do you want
to make
racism go away stop saying that some
people are racist and some people are
not
that's what causes racism it's the frame
as soon as you accept the false frame
that some people are racist and some
people are not
you've got to fight on your hands right
because everybody's going to say
well if there are racists and i know for
sure i'm not one of them
then i've got a pretty good idea you
might be one of them because i know they
exist
because that's the frame i've accepted
some are some are racist
some are not so they're out there and i
know i'm not one
so maybe you're one because of those
things you said or those things you did
here's the most productive frame you
could ever have
everybody's racist now
i don't mean in the sense that they're
practicing actively or
conscious of it but brains
are pattern recognition machines that's
what they do they recognize
patterns but the problem is we're really
shitty at it
so we see patterns that are fake
patterns we imagine that if we see
something twice
well that draws a line two points make a
line
now i know everything in the world about
everything but it doesn't work that way
we see patterns where there are no
patterns but also we see patterns
that are true that just don't tell you
anything useful
and you imagine it does right so what
does it tell me for example
if the pattern is uh most
let's say most nobel winning scientists
were white guys
let's say that's true is that true i
don't know if that's true but let's say
it is because it feels like
something that might be true does that
help me
can i take credit for that can i say hey
i'm a white guy
and there are a lot of these nobel
prize-winning white guys
so yay white guys how does that make
sense
because what what exactly did i do in
this scenario
did i win some kind of nobel prize
that i don't know about the fact that
i'm a white guy
and that there are other white guys who
are maybe bending the curve
like they're they're skewing the average
for white guys
but that doesn't accrue to me like i
don't get any credit for that
i did nothing right so as soon as you
imagine
that there's something about the average
of your group
that's important it's not
it doesn't have any anything to do with
you you didn't do those things
you know what if you say the average
basketball team is black
does that help the people who are not on
the team who happen to be black
how does that help them they're not on
the nba team
i'm not on it so that the people who are
changing the average
for your group they're not you
for the most part right they're just not
me and they're not you
so that doesn't have much effect on us
except maybe in how you understand
the situation i guess so here's the most
productive thing you could do
you say that everybody's a racist
because we're born that way
because we have pattern recognition
brains can't turn it off
if you turned off your pattern
recognition you would just be a
vegetable
it's the only thing that causes you to
act is recognizing patterns and say oh
if i don't go to work i get fired that's
a pattern so i better go to work
well thank you stefan or stephen
who says i'm pretty fly for a white guy
uh that's the whitest thing anybody ever
said i think
all right um so
i think we should get to the point where
we can see the ridiculousness
of racism rather than
condemn it it should be mocked
because the whole race racism
imagines that you're an idiot first of
all
if you think that you can predict how
somebody's going to do in some
instance because of their ethnicity well
you're an idiot
it's not it's not really racism isn't
quite the problem there is it
if you say to yourself i'm not going to
hire this person
for a job even though their credentials
look good
because of what the race how does that
help you
because wouldn't you rather have a good
employee all things being equal
so so i i think
we should treat it way less seriously
while also being deadly serious about it
because the subject is serious
right but that doesn't mean that the way
you treat it all the time
in every interaction every communication
every social media thing
should be serious i think we should be
you should be able to
talk to somebody of any ethnicity and
joke about the fact that they have a
stereotype
that in all likelihood does not apply to
them individually
just like you know i think it's funny
now it's easy
right it's easy if you're a white guy to
to laugh at this stuff
but i feel like it's the most productive
way
because if somebody says to me that i
can't dance and i like cheese
is that racist yeah i guess so right
because white people can't dance and we
like cheese
yeah it's racist but does it apply to me
okay by coincidence i like cheese and i
can't dance
but that's just a coincidence has
nothing to do with me being white
or does it i don't know but it's funny
either way
right how seriously can i take that
um anyway
we should learn to laugh this stuff off
while also treating it
like it's deadly serious right you can't
ignore it
you got to take care of the important
stuff um
here's a question would it be legal or
i think it would be economical but would
it be legal
to have an invitation-only health
insurance
business where the only people who can
join it
are people who are recommended by people
who are already in it
and maybe more than one or something
like that some kind of way
that people who know that other people
they know
let me be less redundant some kind of
way where a member of the health
insurance
group can recommend somebody who has a
healthy lifestyle
and that's all you know about for
example i have a friend
who is the most lifestyle
committed person i've ever seen right
eats right
exercises just does everything that
a wise person should do to take care of
their own health
don't you want to be in the same group
as them
somebody who's taking care of themselves
and you get the cheapest rate
because if you could only put in people
who you knew were pretty healthy
now of course it'd be hard to bring in
the whole family and then what happens
if somebody gets unhealthy after they're
in the group i think you'd have to keep
them
that would be part of your risk but i
just wonder if you could
if you could do that legally would there
be any
legal prohibition against that the
answer is
no currently not legal okay
so i'm hearing people say it's not legal
because it would be discrimination would
it but would it
would it be discrimination i don't know
could be it would be discrimination if
the company decided
who could be in but would it be
discrimination if the members decided
that's the question all right so
have you seen the flooding and i don't
know if i'm pronouncing right
zhengju china uh
apparently i saw the ian bremer ian
bremmer
tweet today that they got eight months
of rainfall in one day
is that true they got eight months of
rainfall in one day and the pictures are
horrific you know cars underwater and
stuff
and you know i like to remind
my listeners every now and then
that i have nothing against the chinese
public
right the chinese people are awesome the
chinese government
i got a problem with them and
i have a some i guess predictions
slash is speculation i think that the
chinese government is a lot closer to
falling
than we realize because you know how
often is it that
you'll think something is a stable
situation say the
the soviet union you know the ussr
but then it changes you really don't see
it coming sometimes things can change
pretty quickly
and there's some bad news happening in
china now if you look at the level of
pollution
they have deadly pollution and they have
now this rainfall stuff
that's that's really messing them up and
they're sort they're still locked down
because of the coved and
they also have a a population problem
right i think they have a
an old people problem but they've got
some massive problems
but there's a bigger problem i think
coming
and i don't know how they could ever
avoid it i could be surprised
but how do they avoid the fact that
sooner or later
they're either going to have a massive
coven problem
or they're going to have to explain why
they don't have a massive covet problem
am i right now sure they can have
therapeutics and vaccinations and stuff
but so far it looks like they're not
even
infected what's up with that
we have a virus that doesn't burn out in
the summer
with variants like crazy are you telling
me that china
can avoid infection from this virus
indefinitely i feel like all they're
doing is pushing it down the road
and maybe they're vaccinating quickly
but they're not going to get there
because they get a lot of people so
i feel as though there's got to be at
least a 50 percent chance maybe more
that china's a coveted emergency is
ahead of them
is that reasonable would it be
reasonable to say that it's
it's ahead i feel like
the chinese government could fall
because there are some
serious bad problems uh happening there
um
let me say in
my gardener just asked if he can start
the leaf blower right below my window
i'm going to tell them to hold off on
that for a few minutes
why is everybody contacting me now
so i just got a text from uh
i i won't tell you who because that
would be part of the story if i told you
who
um so i'm being told uh
oh the yesterday's volume on youtube
was bad yeah i do know that so i do know
that yesterday's volume on youtube was
actually bad
so which is why i turned it off
all right let's go back to our
show anyway cli i think china's got a
big problem and it's going to get worse
god damn it stop texting me
okay all right
uh have you heard biden's babble i want
to read for you
uh what biden said today i think you are
yesterday i guess
so this is biden's actual quote and an
answer to it doesn't even matter what
the question is
here so he said this and i'll read it
exactly as he said it
the question is whether or not we should
be in the position
we're in
wait what do you say uh why can't the
experts say we know this virus is in
fact going to be the excuse we need
wait no that's the wrong part god damn
it
sorry didn't mean to use the lord's name
and vein there
sometimes it just slips out um
i actually try not to do that but it is
slip out
uh well you're gonna have to go find
that because i cut and paste the wrong
thing
into my notes but uh biden has another
babel session that's just it's one for
the ages
and i noted today that biden is the only
president who sounds the same if you
read his
read his statements backwards or
forwards because they're just sort of
words
they don't have that whole grammar
structure thing that you expect
so uh
here's a fascinating thing so i guess
yesterday roger pilkey
jr who's an expert on climate change
disaster stuff
he testified in congress and as michael
schellenberger is tweeting today
that uh senator tester who apparently is
a democrat was shocked
to learn from roger pilkey jr
that the the expense for natural
disasters
as a percentage of gdp
has gone down basically consistently for
years and years and years
so we're sort of at a low point for the
cost
of natural disasters and this democrat
who's actually has an important job
that's relevant to climate change
just think about this this is a senator
whose job
for the country is in part
climate change related so he's got a
responsibility in this field
specifically
and did not know that we're at the
lowest
cost of natural disasters in history
now how many of you knew that because i
knew that
did most of you know that
uh if you if you do any reading of uh
michael schellenberger's work you
probably knew that
if you listen to me you probably know
that because i quote him all the time
um bjorn lomborg
if you read any of his stuff you
probably knew that so i'm looking in the
comments to see how many people knew it
i'm saying yes yes no you told me
knew it for years yes yes via lumberg
uh nope ashley says yes yes yes
nope so even even in this audience
which i would consider far more informed
than the average
probably 30 percent saying no that's a
lot of people
a lot of people i i believe that the
deaths are at an all-time low as well as
the expense i'm not sure if they're all
time
but everything's trending the right
direction now of course the reason
is not that the disasters are getting
less
the reason is that we're better at
preparing and and compensating for them
um oh here we go here's uh
somebody pasted in on locals somebody
pasted in
the actual biden quote
let's see if i can make this stop
scrolling for a minute so biden said
and the question is whether or not we
should be in a position where you
are um are why can't the um the experts
say we know that this
virus is in fact or uh or um uh
uh is this it's going to be or excuse me
we we we know uh why all the drugs
approved are not temporary temporarily
approved but permanently approved
reads the same forwards or backwards
thank you for
posting putting that in there um
one of the reasons that climate science
is always going to be a big story
is you know if i told you to follow the
money
now there are lots of reasons that
climate change
should be a big story the obvious
reasons right because
the scientific community says the world
is in big trouble
so that's good reason for a big story
right
but how many other things fall in this
category
wouldn't you say that there are many
stories that you could put into the
category of
the experts say we're in big trouble
right there's all kinds of stuff that
the experts say we're in big trouble
we're going to run out of fertilizer or
something phosphates or some damn thing
whatever it is that they put in
fertilizer
so we get all these big disasters but
climate change will always get the
headlines and here's why
and the answer is obvious because it's
the easiest thing to write about
so if you're a journalist and you could
do hard work
and get paid or you could do easy work
and get paid which one are you going to
do
follow the money people are always going
to do easy work to get paid if they have
the option
and what could be easier than looking
out of the window and saying
it is raining really really hard
maybe it's because of climate change
experts agree that the weather is
getting worse
it's literally the easiest story you
could write
so you'll always get more of those
i saw a poll from california insider i
guess showing that larry elder is
leading
uh in the recall race against gavin
newsom meaning
that as an alternative to newsom he's
getting more votes than the other
alternatives so it's just
combining i think we're only comparing
the alternatives not
to do some but everybody's only getting
small percentages because it's mostly
unknowns running for
running against newsome but larry
elder's
top of the field was 16
so this could get interesting
i said before i don't know a ton about
larry elder
but from what i can deduce he has all
the tools
i think he has the full tool set so
maybe maybe maybe he could pull off a
surprise
so in the olympics the sweden defeated
the u.s
women's soccer team and that was a
surprise because the u.s women's soccer
team
hasn't lost in two years or something so
they're like crazy dominant
but sweden kicked their asses three
nothing
and this was as many noted after the
entire team
uh knelt to black lives matter
before the game now
you've heard from me that kneeling
before a competition
if your competition is not kneeling
puts you at a disadvantage because i
think your
your physical body influences your brain
in the same way that your brain
influences your body it's a two-way
situation
so for example if you slump your
shoulders
we already know because when people
slump their shoulders looking at their
phone
it changes their body chemistry can make
them in a
less good mood
my microphone fell off excuse me
so uh and we've heard but there's some
controversy about whether this is true
that if you do the victory pose you know
you you stand up and you put your arms
up like this like
like victory that it makes your body
chemistry
change in a positive way can put you in
a good mood
now i've heard some controversy as to
whether that's true
but i do this all the time like as an
experiment
you know the victory pose and i can tell
you i feel better every time and it's
immediate and i can feel it now is it a
placebo
i don't know but i'm pretty sure it
works even as a placebo
so i don't know why it works but i
definitely get in a better mood if i
change my
change my posture straighten my
shoulders
these things definitely change how you
feel
so i have speculated that putting
yourself in the universal
position of defeat and submission which
is kneeling
would have some kind of influence on you
as an athlete that would be negative and
it would come out in your performance
now i don't know if that's been
demonstrated yet in the scientifically
legitimate way
but i still think it's it's obviously
true that it affects performance
as a hypnotist i will make this
statement
i don't have any scientific proof
um say hi to your uh
nine-year-old who's who's watching um
hi anyway um
so but i but i think that could be
studied anyway uh
so the january 6 commission
the idea that congress or the house
specifically is going to put together a
bipartisan bipartisan commission to look
into
the january 6 riot if you want to call
it that at the white house
or at the uh at the capitol
and this has been a really interesting
chess game
so the first part of the chess game is
that the democrats want to have this
commission
because it keeps the news on
what trump did and can keep him out of
the presidency
it makes the republicans look bad they
figure
so the first move for the chess game is
they say we've got to have this
commission
and pelosi can make it happen because
they got the majority
now here's the second play the second
play is that kevin mccarthy
republican decides who's going to be put
on the committee
for his side and he picks two people who
have to be rejected
jim jordan and jim banks because both of
them
had said things somewhat dismissive
of the problem i think in the capitol
riots
or supportive of no actually i think it
was
they both said something supportive of
trump's baseless claims of election
fraud
as cnn says it uh likes to phrase it
so by kevin mccarthy intentionally
poison pilling the committee it caused
nancy pelosi to say
no i reject them but
it's bipartisan and these are the people
that the other side wants as their
representatives
so are you being bipartisan if you
reject the other side's
team you can reject your own team
but if you're being bipartisan you can't
reject the other side's team
that's their team and so mccarthy
quite cleverly poison pills this whole
thing by sending two people that have to
be rejected
you figure right it was a good play so
uh
so sure enough pelosi rejects them
and then kevin mccarthy what's his next
play
his next play is to say the whole thing
is illegitimate
so all five of our members are going to
be pulled back
so it gives mccarthy this a really good
poison pill de-legitimacy play where he
can say the whole thing is not
bipartisan
because you rejected our team but he
made sure that
they were people who could be rejected
it's pretty good
so if you're if you're sort of seeing
who's playing the best
chess game i would say pelosi started
strong
because it keeps it in the news so she
gets the win for keeping it in the news
but mccarthy's chess match here
pretty good pretty good so
who knows what happens next you know we
don't this is not the end of the game
so this continues but as a chess game
well played both sides well played this
is fun to watch
because it doesn't really have any real
meaning i don't think
but the politics of it are really fun
i guess biden actually got fact checked
by cnn and badly
because biden said in his town hall
you're not going to get coveted if you
get these vaccinations
and as we know you will get
sometimes coveted if you have the
vaccinations
um but i think this was the case and i'm
going to use the
uh trump on the other foot standard
which is
if if trump had said this
would i have defended trump the answer
is yes
because to me this looks more like
just getting a word mixed up which is a
different problem
i don't think he i don't think there's
any chance that biden is
unaware that you can still get the
the covet if you have a vaccination so i
don't think that was
that kind of a problem but i'm
speculating right
i would say the most likely explanation
is that what he meant to say is
that you're not going to die if you get
the vaccinations
now that would also be a little bit of
an over a claim because some people
will in fact die who were vaccinated and
still got the
the covent but hardly any
there there's so few people that
if he had said you're not going to die
if you get these vaccinations
i would have said that's fair enough you
know for a
speaking off-the-cuff non-scientists to
say
so i'm going to defend biden from cnn's
fact-check i'll bet you never
i bet you never thought you'd see that
right but i think i think cnn
is corrected to fact-check him of course
but
i think they should have given a little
bit more
thought to why he was wrong and it looks
like he just misplaced a word
that would be my guess i doubt he
misunderstands that
um here's how to spot a
covidient uh that would be a somebody
talking about covet who is also an idiot
a co-of idiot uh
well i'm looking at sparky's comment
about january 6 being a
fbi false flag i don't think we're going
to find that
i don't think it's ruled out in the
sense that you know i suppose anything's
possible
but i'd be really surprised if the
january 6 event
was anything but what we think it was
it looks like we know exactly what it
was i don't think there are going to be
any surprises
now will there be informants and fbi
people
who were part of it did they act like
they were promoting it to be part of the
undercover yeah probably
but i don't think that made the
difference i think i think we'll be
surprised
uh if we find any surprises
all right here's how to spot somebody
talking about kovid who is also
an idiot if somebody talks in certainty
about you know this is definitely
riskier than that
they don't know what they're talking
about because we can't really estimate
the risks of any of this stuff
not at this point and if somebody leaves
out
any of the big risks then
you should not take them seriously
for example if somebody talks about the
risk of vaccination versus not
vaccination
and they don't mention the long-haul
risk then i think they're not really
they shouldn't be taken seriously right
because if you're ignoring the long haul
as part of your decision making you're
probably ignoring the most important
part
because the risk of the vaccination and
the risk of dying from covid are both
about the same
zero so so you could just round those to
zero
and then just look at uh look at the
things that are
a real risk which is long haul covert
so if if people don't speak in terms of
risk and they
leave out the biggest risk the long haul
they're just not serious people and you
shouldn't take them serious
um somebody says
my opinion what part was my opinion that
you disagree with
i don't think there's anything you said
there now
how many of you are bothered by
the sean hannity's and anybody else
who is telling you to get vaccinated
does that bother you
that any let's say non-doctor
tells you to get vaccinated
and just looking at your comments i'm
seeing almost all no's
i see one yes it's unethical yes
i see some people yeah i hate it you
know some of you are bothered by it
now i hope you all remember my take on
this
my take on vaccinations for the
millionth time is that i'm not a doctor
so don't listen to me the last thing i'm
going to do is tell you to get a
vaccination
that's up to you you and your doctor you
work that out
right don't don't come to me for your
vaccination advice
but that said i think it's useful for us
to all to talk about the logic of it and
the risks and
you know to fully fully understand the
you know the whole architecture of the
decision but that is your decision
and yours won't look like mine and it
doesn't need to
so it is now a
a pandemic of the unvaccinated
and if the unvaccinated want to
have a pandemic that doesn't have much
effect on me at this point
i'm okay with that that's a choice
and it's not irrational um
it's maybe different than i would make
but i'm not going to say anybody's an
idiot for making that choice
i i think reasonable people can comment
on this in different places so
um
oh there's a good question has anybody
heard from ali alexander
is he in hiding i don't know i don't
know what his situation is
he sort of disappeared and probably had
to
all right that is all for today i'm
going to say goodbye to
youtube and i'll talk to you tomorrow
