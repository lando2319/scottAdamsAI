good morning everybody and welcome to
the best time in the universe it's
called coffee with scott adams and those
of you who have enjoyed it before can
confirm that there's nothing better in
the history of
all humanity and possibly before that
and possibly any alien planets we don't
know that for sure but
[Music]
my speculation is that it's the best
thing on their planet too
they don't even know it yet
but how can we take it up a notch well
it's easy all you need is a cup or a bug
or a glass a tanker chelsea's dying i
can't eat your flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip famous around the world
and it's going to happen right now if
you're lucky
go
well yes
i like to think of myself as the greg
gutfeld of the morning that's right uh
if you haven't been paying attention
greg gutfeld's new
show on uh fox news
which he's got an evening show competing
with the uh
the late night
uh shows on other networks and he's
killing him
i i knew that he had beaten uh colbert
who had been the top i guess before that
but i didn't realize how much he beat
him by i saw the actual numbers it's
actually shocking he just destroyed the
the next best
competitor but i'd like to i'd like to
say this someday
this live stream will be the the the
greg feld of the morning
except with me
all right well uh
good news my
my next single has dropped
and by that i mean akira the don's next
single in which
there are samples of my voice from the
podcast use in it now if you haven't
seen this genre of music you need to
check it out just for curiosity alone
even if you're not a music person
you have to see how he's combined the
the podcast uh content into a musical
form and created a new genre really it's
kind of cool so check that out akira the
dawn the new one is called be good at a
few things that you can control from an
earlier podcast
um
you know endorsements in the political
world usually don't matter
you know some some hollywood person or
other
makes an endorsement and we largely
don't care
but every now and then there's one that
might make a difference here's one in
the california recall election for the
governor
um
there's a new endorsement for larry
elder
who is
leading among the candidates to take
over for newsome if in fact he is
recalled it looks like it's going to be
close so it might happen but the new
endorsement is from california's senate
majority leader
gloria romero
um
and she's a democrat
right
yeah i think that's the story that she's
a democrat
so
that might be an actual pretty big one
that could be pretty pretty big
and she said she was sick of uh
she told tucker carlson i guess the
elders the best option to replace newsom
in order to eradicate the governor's
quote hypocritical and pompous behavior
hypocritical and pompous so in the end
that's what got her
it wasn't the having no water
that wasn't the problem
so in order to get a democrat
to go against another democratic office
it's not the lack of electricity
it's not the fact that you can't go
outside like right now i can't go
outside
i can't go outside
that's how poorly managed my state is
there's so much forest fire smoke
i actually can't go outside you know
except to walk to the car or something
so
what does it take for democrats to turn
on the governor who has made the state
so unlivable
let me say it again
you can't walk outside
that's pretty unlivable
but it wasn't any of that that made a
difference it wasn't the homelessness
the the immigration emergencies none of
that got her
it was that he ate at the french laundry
when it was completely legal to eat at
the french laundry
it was hypocritical but it was legal
now maybe he should have worn a mask or
something i don't know
but
this wouldn't matter
you ask yourself who is the bravest
human being in the world
or the bravest human beings in the world
no not me
stop it stop it it's not me no the the
bravest human beings in the world
might be the afghan women activist who
just staged a small protest in taliban
controlled kabul friday
what
uh
what
that's like the bravest thing i've ever
heard of in my life
or stupidest somebody says
but
apparently they got away with it but i
don't know if they're going to get away
with it for long or what
so there's interesting thing happening
over in afghanistan which is that the
leadership is saying yes women will be
able to work and go to school and stuff
but the individual fighters even the
leadership admits the individual
fighters
in the taliban may not be so on board
with that plan and so uh they're having
tough time controlling their own
fighters
which interestingly they admit
the telebrand you know obviously i'm not
going to be pro taliban but there's
something weirdly refreshing about the
taliban
i hate to say it but here's the taliban
who have this problem where they're
individual
fighters or just they can't control them
and then they just tell you that yeah we
can't control our individual fighters
and stuff
i don't know if i don't know if an
american politician would have said that
i think an american politician would
have blamed trump
it's just automatic but at least they
say they have a problem and they admit
it
here's what i think is going to happen i
think that women have gotten too much of
a taste of freedom over there and i
think that women will in fact get power
uh
slowly but i think they will acquire
power in afghanistan and they will
change the taliban
because that's what changes anything
right when when women get power
everything changes and i think they have
enough just enough of a foehold
that if you see some more insanely brave
people like the ones who protested
and the taliban leadership is saying
that they're going to include women
so i mean if the leadership gets control
of its people and they mean it i don't
know maybe they don't mean it but i
think they have to
because they're not going to get foreign
investment if they don't get right with
her with their female
citizens
so i think the taliban is going to have
to actually get right with women
and eventually women will change it from
the inside
it might be a 30-year process but i
think that's where it's going i i would
think that afghanistan is far more
likely to become more moderate in time
because the
because of the woman
the women issue
well here's the cdc with a uh
provocative new update
they say about 83 percent of the u.s
population 16 and up have some degree of
immunity to the coronavirus
either from vaccination or prior
infection so they're saying now that uh
20
20 of the public have prior infection
20 percent
does that sound right and apparently
it's double what they thought it was
so if
twice as many people have had an
infection than we thought before based
on new serology studies
does that mean that the death rate
uh or at least the the dangerousness of
the the flu is half as much as we
thought
if twice as many people have it than we
thought
this is a
uh tim pool's question on twitter does
that mean that the danger was half as
much as we thought
now the danger is the danger because
we're counting bodies right so the
bodies of the bodies
but
there's something about the numbers we
don't understand right
now how did we get to 83 percent of
adults over 16
uh are covered with immunity and we
don't have any herd immunity
what
apparently 83 percent doesn't get you to
herd immunity now maybe because the
vaccinations are not stopping the virus
they're just stopping symptoms
or making it less dangerous so maybe you
just can't stop it so maybe there's no
hurt immunity
because vaccinations don't stop the
spread
so whatever you thought about oh if we
only get to this percentage uh
vaccinated we're in good shape
i don't think that is a thing anymore
right
uh correct me if i'm wrong have our
experts stopped talking about herd
immunity
am am i correct that they've entirely
stopped talking about herd immunity and
now they're only talking about getting
everybody
a therapeutic dose of vaccines
i'm right right they just stopped
talking about herd immunity so they were
wrong
completely
apparently i mean i don't know how much
more wrong you could be
i thought that the one thing that the
the experts would get right
is the herd immunity part
didn't you
i mean i would have i would have been
flexible if you know if the real number
had been between let's say
60 and 85
you know i wouldn't be too critical if
it was somewhere in there but they
didn't get it exactly but the fact that
there's literally no herd immunity
who who is guessing that
who was it who guessed the zero herd
immunity because it looks like no herd
immunity to me
doesn't it because it just turns into a
new variant
and then it just keeps going
so
this is like pretty big news i'm not
sure we know exactly the implications of
this
meanwhile australia is going bat
crazy i guess the government of south
australia
has implemented a new policy
where you have to use an app with facial
recognition and geolocation
and they will randomly contact you and
you have to prove who you are and where
you are
what
this is a real thing
this is actually happening in a real
place on the world
right on the planet
you actually have to check in with the
government
and they will randomly contact you
and you do facial recognition and
geolocation and you better be in your
quarantined location
what
you know on one hand you can see that
this would just be a handy tool
but on the other hand
oh my god is this scary
oh my god
so
uh we'll watch australia see how that
works out
um in our next segment which i call
perma news the news that is still news
even though it never changes
it seems like the details change but not
in any significant way
and today i would like to once again see
if i can get through talking about
the infras
excuse me the infrastructure built
sorry i'm getting a little sleepy when i
talk about the
topic
but i want to see if i can give you an
update about the infrastructure bill i
know it's the most exciting topic
so it turns out that joe mentioned
oh god
uh joe manchin didn't doesn't want to
pass the infrared
ah what we were talking about
i don't know
let's go on to the next topic
um
that was the infrastructure built
uh adam dopamine tweeted today that uh
the experts have discovered uh
and i didn't i didn't realize this was a
risk but a lot of you understand that uh
trump derangement
syndrome or tds
was a pretty big problem during his
administration but now the experts have
discovered that there's a long-haul tds
so
um
apparently trump derangement syndrome
was not limited to his term in office
they've discovered long haul
some of the symptoms i'm i'm adding this
for myself but some of the symptoms of
long-haul tds would be
you still believe trump recommended
drinking bleach
debunked a long time ago but you still
believe it that would be signs of
long-haul tds or you still believe that
trump
called neo-nazis in charlottesville fine
people
totally debunked but if you still
believe that that would be
signs of long-haul tds
and as adam points out it includes the
onset of biden regret syndrome
that can be a symptom of long-haul tds
and a gradual decrease in your
anti-trump smugness
so if you're finding any any decrease in
your anti-trump smugness over time that
could be a sign too
cnn has a fact-check joe biden who
talked about visiting the tree of life
synagogue after that horrendous shooting
except that joe biden never never
actually visited the tree of life
synagogue oh he has a story about it
he seems to remember it quite correctly
or no quite clearly
except it never happened
so even cnn is calling bs on joe biden's
made up story
meanwhile the biden administration
looking for every way to fail the public
has decided to remove certain penalties
for fentanyl-related
trafficking
what
why is all the news
something that you you just have to
pause and then go
what am i reading this correctly like
you think you're not even reading it
right
it couldn't possibly be true
that he's
is he finding just new ways to be a
dumbass
the correct penalty for dealing fentanyl
is death
because the correct penalty for any
terrorist act
is death
the correct penalty for being a mass
murderer
is death
and if you're a major i'll say a major
fentanyl dealer i'm not talking about
somebody on the street who sold a few
pills but if you're a major fentanyl
dealer you've killed a lot of people and
you knew you were doing it
if you kill a lot of people
in an illegal way
and you you know usually illegal
and you know you're doing it and you
know it's going to happen before you do
it
that's the death penalty oh i know what
you're going to say are you saying to me
scott what about personal responsibility
what about the people who took the drugs
why do we dr why do we judge the dealers
let's just let everybody do whatever
they want
and let people take personal
responsibility
well you have forced me to go to the
white board
yeah i didn't want to do this
but
yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna pull a
whiteboard on you
sorry
sorry you pushed me to the limit and now
i'm going a full whiteboard
never go full whiteboard
unless you mean it
there are two views of the world that i
see
one of them
regarding addiction
one of them is that we have this thing
called free will and if you've got
enough of it and you choose to use it
you can say no fentanyl no stay away i
will use my free will and all my powers
to keep the fentanyl away
what's wrong with that
why not use your free will to keep the
fentanyl away and then it doesn't matter
if anybody produces it
you're not going to take it why not
well could it be
because free will is completely
imaginary yeah it is free will is
imaginary people act on their greatest
impulses
that's it
if i had a great hunger for something i
would eat it even if i knew it wasn't
the healthiest food
it's not how much willpower you have
that doesn't even exist it's just how
much competing interest you have in any
given question
sometimes something is more attractive
than something else sometimes it isn't
that's it
free will is an imaginary concept that
we get after the fact i say well i must
have used my free will there nope
your brain is subject to the laws of
physics one of your impulses was bigger
than the other and that's why you made
the decision you made
that's it
however there's another concept that
must be introduced called addiction
if you imagine the free will existed
spoiler it doesn't it's all it's only
imaginary but if it existed let's say
you think you did
i got some free will
well then if you understood what
addiction is addiction is the thing that
cancels your free will
that's what it is
an addiction is the thing that cancels
your free will
if you don't understand that
then you then you're calling for
personal responsibility
for a person who couldn't have any it
wouldn't be possible it's not medically
possible you'd ask it's like asking a
person with you know no arms and no legs
to play ping pong
right you could ask
hey use your personal responsibility and
go play ping pong you lazy bastard with
no arms and no legs
use your free will well they can't
they can't because they got no arms and
no legs
likewise if you're addicted you don't
have free will that's not a thing
if you don't understand that an addict
does not have free will then you don't
know what an addiction is you don't know
what the word means or something i don't
know
so
if you think that people can just use
their personal responsibility to avoid
fentanyl you have
two problems with your thinking one that
you think the free will actually exists
and two you don't know what addiction is
terrible analogy there's no analogy here
there's a drawing but not an analogy
not in the sense that you're thinking of
it
all right
sorry i had to go to the whiteboard for
that
sometimes you just got to do what you
got to do
this is another adam dopamine tweet
who's on fire today
um
apparently the uh
british
who is it the uh
secretary of defense or something yeah
the uk's defense secretary
suggested that the u.s should no longer
be considered a superpower
so there's another joe biden
accomplishment
joe biden
is actually such a bad president
that the uk
one of our strongest allies
doesn't think we should be called a
superpower anymore oh he admits we have
lots of power
yeah you have lots of power
but the way you've got nf afghanistan
was so lame
that's like you don't even have a
superpower if you're going to use it
that poorly what's the point of having
power it's not too super it's just power
so thank you joe biden for making us
look bad in the international arena
wasn't joe biden so supposed to improve
our reputation around the world
is it working i don't think so
on the other hand trump who is not even
president is doing great lately he had a
great week
because the wto the world trade
organization ruled in his favor so i
guess
the first thing trump did was slap some
sanctions on china for their solar panel
abuse and that went to the world trade
organization for dispute and they just
backed trump 100
trump's first trade thing do you
remember how much pushback he got
don't start a trade war
no
no everything will go to hell if you
start a trade war
who
who was it who told you that trump can
start a trade war and we'll be fine
i do i did
can if anybody's here to confirm that
can you confirm
that when trump started the trade war
all the smart people said everything's
going to go to hell right
what did i tell you
i told you no nothing's going to go to
hell we'll just come out ahead
trump did the thing that all the smart
people said don't do
don't start a trade war
here we are a few years later the world
trade organization just agreed with him
100 percent
and how's our economy doing
well considering the pandemic pretty
good
so i think that trump is having a great
week he's not even president and he's
killing it
right i mean that's that is fair that is
fair
so anyway rate this as one of my correct
predictions uh against the grain the
only ones i care about are the ones
where everybody said something else was
going to happen
and you know i took the contrarian view
because those are the ones that are fun
all right let's look at biden's record
so far immigration disaster trump did
better covet getting worse probably not
trump biden's fault right
i don't know that biden did anything
wrong with with covert necessarily but
it's getting worse so he's president so
it's going to look like his fault the
same way it looked like trump's fault
that we had a bad first wave
inflation is worse that's bad china
looks like they're unchecked
reverse wade looks like it probably has
been neutered by the texas law on
abortion
now of course if you're conservative you
say well that's good news
but if you are biden's base
biden just lost roe vs wade on his watch
now was there anything he could do about
it no not really i don't think he had
any power but it happened on his watch
so
i know i think that accrues to him in in
the indirect way that we say presidents
are responsible for everything he
botched the afghan pull out obviously
but on the positive side stocks are up
which has more to do with the economy or
i would say stocks are up despite
uh biden wouldn't you say because the
things biden is doing would have age
would be a drag on stocks
if he's going to raise taxes for example
that would be a drag on stocks but
they're up anyway so i don't think you
can give him credit for the if the only
thing he did was a drag on stocks
and the other thing you got to give
credit biden credit for is the the
rioting stopped
uh
i guess structural racism uh not so much
so much a problem now
so it was an imaginary problem not
imaginary problem uh structural racism
is real
as is systemic racism the way i define
it anyway is real
but the riots stopped people stopped
complaining about it in the streets
anyway
so that's good anyway so the biden
presidency looks like an unmitigated
disaster
um
there's a story in axios they've got
some kind of a looks like they had a
exclusive there's a
well-known silicon valley investor
who is uh being accused of dismissing
racism
dismissing racism and when you hear this
story
what do you first think
oh my god there's some old white guy
who just dismissed racism this is going
to be bad
because that's what the headline says
it says a silicon valley investor
dismissed racism
it's got to be an old white guy
right because first of all
you know you when you think of silicon
valley investors even though even though
they're not all white obviously
your brain goes there because the
stereotypes you know the first ones you
think of often
but it turns out that the silicon valley
investor who dismissed racism was a
was one um what's her name
her last name is woo w-u
um and so
i'm thinking that ms wu
may not be an old white guy after all
may not be an old white guy
somebody here says they automatically
think uh indian american when they think
of venture capitalists that's the that's
the other thing you think or asian
american
so yeah if you're going by stereotypes
alone that's what you think
um
so here's what uh ms wu said said
allegedly quote i don't believe in black
lives matter if anything i think they
are the true racist trying to stir up
things to make this country uh going to
socialism or even communism potentially
now
is that opinion racist
would that be dismissing racism
i don't think she dismissed racism she
just called it out
she just said
here's an example of racism she just
says the black lives matter people so
that would be the opposite of dismissing
it wouldn't it
literally
she confirmed it she just pointed to a
different place to find it
now do you think
um
do you think that that ms wu
do you think that she believes there's
no actual racism in the country
well she's silent on that question
but i doubt it
right do you think
that if you asked her hey but are you
saying there's no racism in the country
is she going to say yeah i don't think
there's any racism in the country no no
she's saying that black lives matter is
racist she probably now we don't know
this so i'm not i don't want to be a
mind reader but i'm just
working with what information we have
and then we have to sort of fill in what
we don't know to have an opinion
i would say that she's not only not
dismissing racism but she's calling out
extra racism
to me it looks like she has confirmed
more racism
than her critics
because she's not dismissing
regular racism
nothing she says dismisses it but on top
of that she's adding that black lives
matter is also racist
that's twice as racist as well as what
black lives matter believes is happening
in the country so she believes things
are twice as racist and she's being
blamed for not thinking racism exists
the opposite of the story
okay
now there's also an allegation that one
ex-employee said that she said something
about
uh why there are not many black people
in stem
and i don't think we should treat that
as a credible allegation
because that one that's too creepy if
you have this
this person who used to work there who
says you said something
and they're like allegedly quoting you
from memory
and they don't have quite exactly the
context maybe i'm not even going to
repeat that allegation i would say the
credibility of that allegation is so low
that you should treat it as non-existent
like it didn't happen basically
[Music]
but
uh here's what axio says
so in in the adding context to the their
own exclusive axio said and they they
put this in the article like this is a
fact okay
see if you would agree that this could
be stated as a fact and just left there
without question all right here's some
context here's a fact
axio says black people are
underrepresented in silicon valley
because of systemic barriers to entry
three percent of venture capital's
investment partners positions were held
by blacks in 2020 according to a survey
blah blah blah and just 1.2 percent of
all venture funding went to black
startup entrepreneurs in the first half
of this year
per crunch base so do you buy that is
that a good explanation of what's
happening
have they proven
axios
that uh black people are
underrepresented in silicon valley
because
of the lack of venture capital funding
this is one of the dumbest things i've
ever seen in my life
now let's accept that there almost
certainly is
far less funding for black entrepreneurs
can we all accept that that's almost
certainly true
right so there's no argument about the
numbers
almost certainly true i mean who would
even doubt it that black entrepreneurs
are getting less venture capitalists for
lots of different reasons
but
by the time people are not getting
funded
the problem already happened
the problem is not the lack of funding
the reason they're not getting funding
is because the venture capitalists don't
think they can make money
that's it or there aren't many of them
right there just aren't enough of them
asking for money are you telling me that
the major venture capitalists don't want
to have a successful black
entrepreneur unicorn in their portfolio
is there anything they'd want more than
that
right this is one of those dumb
things that people have never lived in
the real world don't understand
if you're a bunch of white people with a
big venture capital firm there's nothing
you want more than to fund a black
entrepreneur especially one that would
be successful you want that as much as
you want
like air
so to act as if like there's some you
know the structural barrier to black
people getting funded is so
backwards it's completely backwards you
show me a black entrepreneur who's got a
skill
and a good idea
they're funded
they're funded every time all
right in the real world
people with skill
get funded and people with skill who are
black
get extra funding or less extra
consideration
now i would do that if i were a venture
capitalist if a black entrepreneur came
with a good idea
i would give them priority
why because it's good for me
just selfish
it would be good for me
if i had a bunch of investments wouldn't
i love to be the like an early investor
in a black unicorn company that would be
like the coolest thing you could ever
say in your world
like it's great to say oh i was an early
investor in facebook and stuff that's
pretty good
early investor in twitter good for you
but
imagine bragging
that you were an early investor in
whatever
black gigantic
unicorn startup and you were one of the
early investors that would be the
coolest thing you could ever say in
american society that you were you know
you you helped that happen
so the the imagination that the funding
is the problem it's not the problem the
problem is
systemic racism for sure
so let's all agree well you don't have
to agree but it's my opinion that it is
systemic racism but it's because of the
the teachers unions
we're not producing enough entrepreneurs
who happen to be black that's the
problem why because the schools
the schools are a mess black kids can't
get a decent education on average right
everybody's different
but
the teachers unions are the source of
all systemic racism and think
it's in the funding
the funding's at the end of the tunnel
right the tunnel was you know all of the
other problems that were before that
point anyway i guess you're all on board
on that
let's talk about uh candace owens who's
in the news for a couple of reasons
now you might know that uh i'm a big fan
of candace owens one of the most
impressive talent stacks you're ever
going to see
you know by talon stack i mean a set of
talents that work well together
and that's what she has she has
she has the most uh
one of the most impressive
you know combinations of talents
everything from you know being young and
good-looking and
being black that she uses to her
advantage to being a great communicator
thinker you know political you know she
knows a lot about stuff
so she just has tons of skills i'm very
impressed by her in general
but she has also opposed face masks
and said some vaccination uh comments
that
the experts do not agree with and so
she tried to get a a kova test
and was denied
the laboratory that did the test found
out who she was
and denied her service
because of her comments
on the pandemic
what
you know it's like all the news has the
same thing you just read the news
straight and then you pause for a moment
and then you say
what
what are you freaking kidding me
now
i don't agree with candace on the number
of her comments about the pandemic but
that doesn't mean i'm right right i mean
have some humility about this i can
disagree it doesn't mean i'm right it
could mean she's right the only thing i
know for sure is we disagree
so
this is outrageous and i guess there was
only one other option where where she
lives or where she wanted to do this and
it was you have to wait in line and it's
first come first serve it's a bad
situation
so this just sucks
but here's the interesting part
remember conservatives didn't were
supporting the bakery that didn't want
to bake a gay wedding cake
this feels a little bit like that it's
not right it's not like that so it would
be a it would be bad to use as an
analogy but it reminds us of it
and then you asked you have to ask
yourself if you like capitalism
does the lab just have the right to
refuse service for any reason
would that be because they're not
discriminating on you know gender or
race or anything as far as we know i
mean there's no indication of it
do they have that right
somebody says it's racist but there's no
indication that that has anything to do
with anything in this case
do they have the right they do right
don't they have a legal right to
discriminate in this case
you know it would be different if it
were a hospital i'd be worried about
that but if it's just a test facility
but on the other hand it is a pandemic
so it's pretty messed up to deny
somebody a test during a pandemic
that's pretty messed up
but she might have the right she might
have the
complete right to do a messed up thing
this would be the owner of the lab who
denied service
candice also in the news a little bit at
least on social media
because i guess the taliban just
announced that china
will be their gateway to international
markets along the one belt road
initiative
and
candace was pointing out that she
predicted
that joe biden would basically give
afghanistan to china
and
looks like she was right but here's
where i disagree with candace
i don't know that china is going to be
happy about this in the long run
because
so far
everybody who's been
involved with afghanistan has come to
come to regret it now china is different
from every other country in lots of
different ways so maybe they won't maybe
they'll be happy maybe they can accept
whatever losses or costs and maybe
they'll be happy for the strategic
advantage and
having their belt road initiative which
connects a lot of stuff so they can do
trade
maybe
maybe it'll be a mess and still
worthwhile because the economics might
be kind of tremendous for them
but i think i would disagree with
candace that this looks like a good
thing for china
i suspect china's going to come to
regret it
but you know i'm only leaning in that
direction candace could be right on this
as well
um i don't like to disagree too publicly
with people i consider smart
because when you disagree with smart
people
you're taking a chance
right
so whether you if you disagree with
somebody like candace you're you
disagree with a smart person and you're
taking your chances
all right uh neil degrasse tyson
uh he tweeted this provocatively now
here's some statistics that i don't know
if are true
so i'm just reporting what tyson says
but you know he's a science proponent of
course famous science proponent
and scientist
astrophysicist i think that's what he is
but he points out that every ten days
eight thousand eight thousand
unvaccinated republican
voters die of covet now how smart is he
to save voters
right look at because he's trying to
persuade
but instead of saying 8 000 unvaccinated
republicans
die every 10 days he says 8 000
unvaccinated republican voters die
that's a little extra isn't it because
then you're saying wait a minute
are you saying that the next election
could be determined by whether we get
vaccinations
and he is saying that
he's very much saying that that the next
election because we have close elections
there might be enough republicans who
die
to change some real election results
that could actually happen i don't know
what the odds are but it feels like it's
like physically possible
but for every every republican who dies
it's there are five times as many of
them as democrats
i need a fact check on that
is it true as tyson claims
neil degrasse tyson that
there are five times as many republicans
dying from covid as democrats
does anybody see this statistic like
that has anybody even
collected that statistic because yeah
somebody says no way to know and that's
where i'm at i don't think we know that
do we
now i had
maybe it's estimated by just what
counties are in or something like that
yeah nobody tracks it i don't think it's
ever been surveyed so i'm a little
hesitant to say it's true
but here's what i like about it
what i like about it is that he's taken
a crack at persuasion
and did a pretty good job
he did a pretty good job
in fact this is exactly what i
recommended
earlier on recommended in terms of if
somebody wanted to be persuasive
what you do is set up a competition
between republicans and democrats
if you reported every day
how many democrats died
vaccinated and not and how many
republicans died every day
vaccinated and not and just put that
little uh
put that little uh data in a you know
sidebar and just put it there every day
where they used to have all the coveted
information
i feel like that would make a difference
because you would turn
your turn democrats and republicans into
competitors
you say all right
see who can who can live the best and
just make it a competition
see who lives the longest all right
should media disinformation be
considered a health crisis
we now have
two parts to health care
one
is the stuff you actually do you know
the setting your broken bones and taking
medicine and stuff the actual care but
the other part of healthcare is
um the
the mental part
you know they what do you know and do
you know enough to get the right care
and are you making the right decisions
you know the mental part and we separate
them like they're somehow separate but i
feel like
the punditry at least in the pandemic
the punditry has become
care
wouldn't you say because people are
definitely being influenced by
non-medical professionals including me
sadly
to make decisions
on their own health
and i think we have to start recognizing
that
the punditry is just part of healthcare
now at least for the the big national
topics not for your everyday stuff it
doesn't matter to your gout
but for the big stuff like a pandemic
the punditry is just healthcare
it is because people are taking their
medical advice from people like me and
i'm telling you not to right i say it a
million times don't don't don't
to get your medical advice from me but
it happens right just because people are
influenced by what they see in here
so somehow we have to deal with that and
i wonder if there will be a day
that will ever be able to calculate how
many people each pundit killed
or saved
could you at some point in the future
let's say this is hypothetical right
let's say someday in the future science
uh came to a consensus
about what worked and what didn't work
in the pandemic we're nowhere near that
right now right now i don't think we
know what works
like we're still arguing maths and
vaccinations and all that stuff but
let's say someday
someday we do have a pretty good idea
what worked and what didn't work
then we could look at the pundits of
what they said you could look at the
size of their platform
you can make an assumption about what
level of influence they have somehow you
could do that and i think you could
actually come up with an estimate
of how many people each pundit killed
or saved because some some pundits would
have said more of the right things and
less of the wrong things
i'd like to know that
maybe 10 years from now when when
uh our our emotions have gone down a
little bit but i so i guess what i would
add to the conversation is i'll bet you
could calculate it i'll bet you could
calculate how many people each panda
killed
so that should keep you honest
rasmussen has a uh excellent red meat
kind of a poll results here they ask
what percentage of people diagnosed with
covid do you think have died from the
disease
so this will be testing uh among other
things
who has better information about kovid
democrats or republicans what do you
think
before i tell you the answer
who do you think has better information
about
the details of kovid republicans or
democrats
specifically just the death rate
so
yeah it's republicans
double
republicans are twice as likely twice as
likely
to get the right answer to this question
so democrats only 21
think that fewer than two percent of the
people um diagnosed
died of the disease
so let me say it in a clearer way the
real number of people who died of covid
is less than one percent right
but it's less than two percent
um
and democrats only 21 percent of
democrats know how few people die of
covet
only 21
one in five democrats
only one in five
even know
close to what the death rate is
that's the biggest factor in your
decision the number one factor in your
decision about what to do personally for
the for the pandemic the number one
thing is how many people are dying
and the democrats
don't know
only one in five knows
i mean that's crazy
one in five
guess the right answer that's it
um republicans aren't you know are not
exactly killing it either only 39 of
republicans think it's less than 2
percent it's twice as much you know it's
twice as much as democrats so that's
good it's still not good
that's pretty uninformed
for both democrats and republicans
so here's the question if democrats have
a higher vaccination rate i think i
think that's true
do they have a higher vaccination rate
because they are
smarter about science
or
dumber about data
you can't tell
or is it both some combination
because i do think the democrats
now i don't hate me but i do think the
democrats might
have a little bit more let's say trust
in
in the experts for the vaccinations
doesn't mean they're right but they have
more trust
but they certainly have less information
about the data
so is are the democrats so smart that
they're believing the experts and
they're right about it or are they so
dumb that they think
that the virus is way deadlier than it
is and that's why they're getting
vaccinated
can't tell
all right
rasmussen also asked do you believe
health officials are lying about the
safety of coven vaccines
well 53 percent of republicans say yes
they think health officials are lying
about the safety of the vaccines
53 percent
think that the people in charge
are lying
about one of the biggest things in the
world you could ever lie about
i mean what would be bigger than this i
mean
you could probably think of something
but it'd be hard
but only 26 percent of democrats
believe that health officials are lying
about the safety of vaccines now keep in
mind we just watched officials lie about
masks
right in 2020
fouchy even admits he lied about it he
lied right to your face about masks
now you still think he was right the
first time or whatever but that's a
different different question he admits
he lied
so the if the same people who lied to
you about masks are telling you certain
things about vaccinations
is it unreasonable to doubt them
no
now
um i would be in the
uh the category that says health
officials are lying about the safety of
everything
not just vaccinations
i just think we're in a weird world
where they're lying about everything
not
you know not everything about everything
but probably every topic's got a little
bit of a lie in it you know not every
part of it though
so i'm not saying that vaccinations
don't work
i'm just saying that there's probably a
lot of lying by the people who are in
charge
all right we only got a minute to go
here
and
luckily
i'm ready
so
here's the thing
i think this was one of the best live
streams in the history of the universe
not just mine but of all time
if you disagree well i don't want to
hear about it because i'm turning off
youtube right now but thank you for
being with me i appreciate you all
and i'll see you tomorrow
