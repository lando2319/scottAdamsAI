out my window from my office what you
should be seeing
instead of this white out conditions you
should be seeing
the town and a ridgeline and some hills
but instead you see nothing but smoke
that's right nothing but smoke
let me close the blinds in here and
that's what happens if i go outside now
it's a hundred and ten degrees out there
today or it will be
same as yesterday the air quality is
unbreathable
and if i stay inside i'm going to get
the covet
everything's great everything's great
if you don't mind 110 degrees
rolling blackouts a little bit of covert
and of course you can't breathe the air
and your house might burn down
but other than that it's looking good
so if i could i i hate to start anal
negative
so let me put a positive spin on this as
i just tweeted
there are really only two places in
california that are dangerous
i don't think you can say that about a
lot of places but in the entire state of
california
only two dangerous places those two
places are
indoors and outdoors
if you can stay away from either being
indoors
or outdoors you'll be safe in california
and the other thing that will make you
safe is the simultaneous septum all you
need is a copper a margarita glass
attack or chalice or stein a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day
the thing that makes everything better
except maybe california
it's called the simultaneous hip and
happy style go
yeah i can i can feel the temperatures
starting to ease there's a low pressure
system coming in from the east
yeah i think things are getting better
somebody says it sounds awful why do you
stay
well have you ever been anywhere else
i i don't like to brag but
it is it is just the truth
i i think this is just objective
objectively speaking if you like good
weather
and you like other stuff california used
to be
like way up here compared to the second
best place if you like weather and
you know a fairly open society kind of
situation
lots of resources but that was then
now i would say that that gap between
california
as a place to live and the second best
place
it's a lot a lot of uh
that gap got closed but it's still just
marginally better than a lot of other
places
because if you move out of california
you might have to experience a thing
called
winter or a thing called
bugs i don't have we've got bugs but not
many of them
have you ever been in in florida during
the summer
it's a little muggy a little bit muggy
they got some bugs
we don't have that so you could take uh
40 off of the goodness of living in
california
and i think that's kind of where we're
at i would say that california is
approximately 40 percent worse all
things
considered from taxes to forest fires
and everything else
probably 40 worse than it used to be and
still
competitive that's just the truth
um but it won't be that won't be that
way much longer
here's an interesting factoid a dog
that's not barking
do you remember how often i was on the
news or news related
channels in 2016. it was quite a bit
in in 2016 i had a contrarian view
that trump would win many of you had the
same view but among the people who
actually
said things out loud in public i was in
the
the group uh they were kind of rare
because i was saying he's definitely
going to win
now i'm still the same person
i might be even arguably more
interesting now
because i've spent enough time talking
about politics
that i'm less of a freak show and maybe
have something to
say i have no interest
from any of the news outlets except for
you know i'll get a you know breitbart
radio
or breitbart actually still has interest
and
fox will occasionally have me on but
absolutely nobody on the left is
interested
just complete lack of interest and
it might be because of what i would say
they don't want their
their i don't think they want their
audience who's sort of locked into their
little
news silo to hear anybody from the other
silo
who has anything to say so it's
interesting to me that there's no
interest in me
now that i've been proven right more
than wrong
you think there would be more interest
don't you
all right let's check in on the biden
riots hashtag biden riots
the hashtag's doing pretty well by the
way still
still zooming and i guess we had some
big games in rochester and portland
if you have not yet seen any of the
humorous
videos from not last night but the night
before of the
antifa guy or black lives matter i can't
tell
who got his feet caught on fire
in a molotov cocktail situation of his
own doing i guess or somebody else's
and he started doing what looked like a
funny dance to put it out
now it wasn't funny if it was you who
had their feet on fire
but if you're just watching it it was
kind of funny
i i don't want to i hate to admit that
it doesn't say
it doesn't speak well of me does it but
you're in the same boat
you laughed when you saw it i know you i
can see you
i can see you you're smiling right now
you know that was funny tragic
but funny um
and it's been put to music by a number
of clever people
if you haven't heard all of the
different musical tracks
some of them are really good and i think
they were all funny
but i want to point this out as a humor
tip
so that you'll be smarter after you're
done with this periscope
on how to write humor now some people
put
to music uh songs that had fire
in in the in the lyrics
like was it johnny cash who has a song
called a ring of fire
so it's very funny to hear johnny cash
singing
you know rang no fire and seeing the guy
dancing with his feet on fire
but that was not and then there was also
a michael jackson a thriller
where they
they played the guy with the the the
feet on fire they played in reverse
so he's moon walking moon walking with
flaming feet
and they played that to michael
jackson's i think his
thriller it was thriller
or smooth criminal or something i don't
know it was one of those
so that was pretty funny but the
funniest one by far
was footloose if you haven't seen the
one
uh you should google it just you know
google
anti-fun footloose and feet on fire
it'll probably come up
and what's funny about footloose
is that the the mood and tone of the
song
footloose is happy and free and
it's sort of like a celebration of life
and freedom and
and all that and it's being put to
put to a guy whose feet are on fire
so here's your here's your humor lesson
of the day
humor or the the laugh reflex
happens when your brain can't process
two things
that don't fit together so if you can
create a joke
where you've put two things together
this sort of fit in
in a pseudo-length pseudo-logic way
but your brain knows they don't go
together that your brain will just laugh
because it's two things that don't
belong together now once you see that
rule
it becomes a lot easier to write huber
or to know that you've written it
correctly
because anytime you can make two things
that don't fit together
fit together with a pseudo-logic
people get that reflex and go ah and
they laugh at it
so listening to the happy footloose on
while the guy's
dancing with his legs on fire he
shouldn't
it shouldn't be funny but it is
all right uh speaking of funny a man in
france
i think this was on the fox news site or
cnn i can't remember which one
but a man in france was injured friday
after he blew up part of his home while
trying to kill a fly
with an electric swatter
again tragic there's nothing funny about
somebody blowing up their home
unless they did it by using an electric
flyswatter
so the man was the man was in his 80s
he was about to eat dinner and he saw
this fly
so he took out his electric flyswatter i
don't know what it makes it electric i
guess it shocks the fly
you would think that hitting the fly
with the flyswatter would do enough
but no he's got to add like an electric
shocker to his flyswatter to really get
the job done
but he was unaware that a gas canister
was leaking from the home
so as soon as he's he swatted the fly
his house
[Laughter]
which is not funny i'm laughing at a
different joke that i thought of at the
same
time i don't know what's wrong with you
if you're laughing at this joke
this is a tragedy i think he was
uninjured i don't know how he
blew up half of his home and was
uninjured but that's the good news
all right so while you were sleeping
the uh coven 19 epidemic
was solved what you don't believe it
no it was it's all solved now so
i might have a little bit of hyperbole
in that statement just a little bit
but listen to my evidence so yesterday
or this morning i guess
we saw the result of a randomized
clinical trial also known as
the good stuff we're not talking about
observational study
where you just look at things that
already happened we're talking about
randomized where they did a you know a
controlled experiment where
they randomly created two groups of
people
who were hospitalized but not yet in the
icu
and they gave them vitamin d now they
also had hydroxychloroquine
and zinc which was part of their
standard
treatment for all of them so everybody
who got treated
was already on hydroxychloroquine and
zinc
where is this you might ask not the
united states surely
that is correct it was in spain so it's
a spanish study
university study linked with the
hospital i think
and they studied 76 people and they
divided them
you know randomly roughly in half
and they found that the ones who are
treated with this
calcifed yellow it's a they call it a
downstream product of vitamin d3
so it's vitamin d3
ish but it's not the same vitamin
vitamin d that you're getting over the
counter
all right so this is sort of a hyped up
beefed up if you will medical grade
vitamin d so some b i want to be as
clear as possible
you don't get that vitamin d
just by getting a pill over the counter
the pillow over the counter might be
useful also but we're talking about a
strengthened version here
and they give it to people and uh so
it it helped keep people
keep people out of the icu by a factor
of
25. it was 25 times
more helpful than the people who didn't
get it
i might be saying that wrong but you
know what i mean the difference
was gigantic out of the control group
exactly one person ended up in the icu
in the uh i'm sorry the the group that
got the vitamin d
this special kind of vitamin d only one
of them ended up in the
icu there were 25 or 26 of them
versus the half of the people
in the other group half of them ended up
in the icu
so it went from half of them going to
the icu
to just one now it's only 76 people
that's not enough it is enough
to get a statistically meaningful result
especially when the result is so
different
if the result had been closer and you
could just say well
mathematically there's a difference but
it's only 76 people
that's when you'd say ah it's only 76
people
that's not nearly enough but if you get
a difference of
25 times then
you still need a bigger you still need a
bigger um trial
it is not a 100 confirmed because one
trial that's even it's it's a
well-designed trial but still 76 people
that's not enough
so it is not a hundred percent confirmed
but uh and also there were some
questions about whether
the two random randomized groups were
truly as random as they could have been
because there were a few more obese
people in the group that didn't get
the d3 so but even if you were to
correct for
all of those differences is still an
overwhelming advantage that was shown
in the study if it if it holds to be
true
now at the same time and by a
coincidence
there was another study an observational
study
now the observational study is not the
good kind
so it's not like the first kind i talked
about which is the gold standard
kind just needed more people that's
that's his main
problem but the
observational study israeli group did
this
and they also found a strong strong
correlation
between how well people handle the covet
and how much
vitamin d they have in them so it found
that if you add vitamin d levels that
were near
normal you did well if you didn't you
did poorly
now you're going to learn something
about the difference between
observational and randomized
and it goes like this the observational
study can't tell you which way the cause
and effect worked
because it because if you're just
looking at what happened
what you don't know is is it because
they didn't have vitamin d
and that's the reason they had poor
outcomes or
did they have poor outcomes because they
were generally unhealthy
and people who are generally unhealthy
also
have low vitamin d so is the vitamin d
just a
a coincidence of the fact that people
who are unhealthy have
bad outcomes or is there a causal
thing the observational study won't tell
you which to which direction it goes
and you can't be entirely sure that you
even have the correlation right
if it's an observational study but
because there is also a randomized
clinical trial that one will tell you
the
direction a little bit more reliably
because the groups
were chosen randomly so if you choose
people randomly
you are not already selecting the
sickest people
you know just accidentally because you
know you're you're a human being so you
maybe you treat the sickest people
differently than the less sickest people
so i'm not sure if i explained that well
but the point is that there are two
pretty strong indicators that vitamin d
might be the silver bullet
because if you could keep 98 of the
people who would have gone into icu
out of the icu if that holds
98 or some number like that
we're done because i don't think that
this
this what would you call it medicine
chemical vitamin i'm not sure what it's
called
but i don't think it's in short supply
as far as i know there's no
shortage of it and it doesn't look like
the kind of thing that people would
necessarily hoard
for preventative reasons we could
probably get there with just sun and
supplements but
if this is true we could be done
we could actually be done now
it's going to take a little while for
the these studies to work through the
system
people will critique them they could
fall apart as other
studies have fallen apart so don't get
too excited
but if the stock market doesn't go up by
the end of today
i'm going to be surprised because it's
looking to me
as though we're very close to maybe we
have it
and that would be amazing now
if this is true and if it turns out that
the vitamin d is the big trick
i would like to remind you that you
should always
look back and look at the people who
predicted things
correctly and keep that in mind for
their next prediction
is this somebody who got the last thing
right and the thing before that right
or have they never been right about
anything
it's a good thing to know oh market is
closed today
darn it yes market's closed
um so tomorrow we'll see what happens
tomorrow
um but i would like to remind you that
the very first thing i ever said about
coronavirus was to take vitamin d
would you confirm that
it must have been january-ish
maybe it was the beginning of february
that i was saying right out of the gate
to take your vitamin d
take your vitamin d now that was before
i'd
noticed any coincidences or correlations
later a few months later i said to
myself
i wonder why some people are getting the
coronavirus and the kova 19 really badly
and some people aren't
and i started noticing a pattern hey
black people are getting it worse what
is what is it that they have in common
low vitamin d hey fat people
people with
diabetes people in certain places
and when you start do you start looking
at all the groups that
performed badly they had one thing in
common
kind of all were low vitamin d but again
the correlation could be backwards you
don't know
so i had suggested months ago that
vitamin d might be the
the magic bullet can't say that it is
yet
but we're getting close to it and if we
get to that just remember who was right
and who wasn't
all right pete butterj
tweeted that if you're used to voting
republican so he's giving
advice to republicans here years from
now your grandkids will ask
what you did in this moment and you'll
have to tell them
if you were a quote john mccain
republican
or a quote donald trump republican
and i tweeted back i'll tell them i
stopped believing in fake news after the
fine people hoax
because here's the thing
a lot of people didn't understand that
when trump was talking about mccain
and you know he said that i like people
who didn't get captured
a lot of people didn't know that was a
joke one of the people who didn't know
that was a joke
um was uh
was listen what's her name daisy fuentes
marx now you might recognize the name
daisy fuentes
as an actress so she's a
an actress you'd recognize her from
various things
she's a blue checker and she tweeted out
this
talking about the mccain thing two plus
years ago this was a story it's on tape
meaning what trump said about mccain
like many other insane things he said
that is blind as zombie followers i
think that's me
i think i'm one of them blind the zombie
followers ignore
but it can't be denied he called senator
john mccain a loser
for being a pow this is typical trump
he's a dumb hate-filled liar and
misogynist
so when i saw that i commented back to
daisy fuentes
marks and i said trump told a chris rock
joke about mccain because chris rock
actually
told that joke before trump did
but but he didn't credit rock
and that i put in parentheses the joke
about preferring heroes who didn't get
caught it was the same joke they just
worded it differently
and then i said you literally want to
overthrow the government
because you don't recognize a joke
that's actually what happened this is
somebody who wants to overthrow the
government to the united states
in other words get rid of trump at any
cost
in part because she doesn't recognize a
joke
and and so i said maybe the problem is
on your end
she responded as you might have might
imagine
this way bs circus with trump's
trained monkeys again i think that's me
i think i'm a trained monkey in this
telling of it
defending his stupidities what's wrong
with you people
again that would be me who cares if
chris rock made a joke
you see where this is going she has now
acknowledged that the president told the
joke
she did not know until i explained it
that it was a joke so now she has to
change her
objection from being a horrible thing he
said
to yeah it was a joke but it's still
horrible
and here's why and she says the
president must know better
than to say something like that there
are many better things to quote as
president how do you fall for this crap
now she also said that uh trump trump
doesn't have any sense of humor
so therefore it couldn't have been a
joke earlier
to which i pointed out that trump is the
most successful stand-up comedian
in the history of humanity
because his rallies which always have
gigantic audiences
are literally stand up comedy he does it
to
entertain he intentionally says funny
things
and his audience laughs and they go
there because they know he's going to
say funny things
that will make them laugh he is
literally the most successful
stand-up comedian in the history of
civilization
if you just look at the number of people
who go in person
to watch him say funny things and then
laugh about it i mean he does other
things but
you have to admit the reason that the
crowd is so big
is that he brings the entertainment and
largely
humor so how can you be an informed
voter as daisy fuentes marx would like
to believe she is i think
without knowing that the president is
not only somebody who doesn't know what
a joke is
he recognizes them but he's the most
successful humorist of all time
in terms of stand-up comedy you know in
front of a live audience
so when you catch somebody off guard do
they change their mind when they get new
information
well i've never seen it happen but
here's a
finance guy somebody who's not an artist
who's a must be a biden supporter
and he repeated the very fine people
hoax as if it were true so as i often do
if somebody thinks the fine people thing
is true
i go in and correct it and i said that's
the low information voter version i like
to say that because it puts people on
their heels
if you tell somebody they're a low
information voter and then you tell them
what they missed
it makes them pretty mad which is partly
why i do it
and now who did he say he specifically
included from the fine people group so i
challenged him to go back and look at
the transcript
now i don't know if you did but here's
the setup
so it's somebody who's a anti-trump
they're not an artist
it's somebody from some kind of a
finance background
so it's somebody who knows critical
thinking and risk management
and i've just told them that a central
part of their belief system
this fine people thing didn't happen
and i just i told him where to look to
confirm it
now i don't know if he looked or he just
knew that if he looked
he would find out he was wrong but here
was his rant
his reaction he tweets me and he says
i see scott adams says has gone from
drawing comics
to randomly commenting on twitter
defending
trump's racist behavior and thinks i'm a
low
information voter okay
so what did i tell you it's it's always
sarcasm so the artist will just say
stuff that's just bad crazy and you
that's how you can tell their artist
like uh you said that's not even
logical but when the people who actually
do understand
reason and logic and risk management
stuff like that like this gentleman
once you show them that they've been
duped by their own
news sources which is what's happened
these are smart people
by and large smart person who
has been fooled by his news sources
because he thinks there's still news
a lot of people who don't know that that
any attempt
to display the news in the objective way
that's not really current day
that's a little bit ten years ago
and and five years ago there was a big
change
so look for the look for the sarcasm
tell
um
so one of the things that happened this
week
is that most of the citizens of
california
became pro-nuclear power
now they don't all know that they're pro
nuclear power
but they will be because we don't have
electricity
in california all day long like you
other people do
and it's because of bad energy
management because we close down a
nuclear pound
plant we're going to close close down or
have some
some gas facility
so we've mismanaged everything
and i think that a lot of californians
are going to learn for the first time
okay okay i'm a little bit desperate now
because i do
need electricity to live so
can i get there with solar panels no
what would work and then i think
nuclear is a guarantee at this point
so we can stop selling nuclear i think
it's sold
we still have to convince people not
convince
because that that imagines that you know
you're not using facts
some people need to be educated that
what nuclear energy is in the year 2020
is
by far the safest type of energy sources
not even close
[Music]
so
michael cohen uh
so there's there's a new cnn trick
that you're seeing a lot of so cnn will
and other
other disreputable news places they'll
do a headline
that'll say something like trump bites
the head off a puppy
and you'll think yourself my god trump
bit the head off a puppy and then you'll
read the article
and there'll be nothing like that it'll
be
trump gently tapped a puppy on the head
and said good doggie and you'll look at
the title again and it'll say
trump bit the head off a dog and then
you'll say
what's happening and then you read the
article trump gently pet a dog
and you think to yourself how is this
even possible that the headline
or even sometimes the theme that they
introduce in the first paragraph
or two like what the article is about
has no resemblance
to the information in the article here's
the best example
you probably saw the story that trump
allegedly hired a an obama alike
to be filmed in his office getting
insulted by trump and then fired
you saw that right you saw you've
probably all seen this story
that trump had such a bad feeling about
obama
that for his own entertainment and no
other reason
he hired a look-alike just so he could
insult somebody
to his face who looked like obama
that was the story right but then
you read the story and it goes on to say
that it was
the the thing was filmed as a humorous
little skit
that was going to play for the rnc but i
guess they didn't use it
so that is completely different
from not only the headline but how they
introduced it when they start talking
about it in the body of the story
and you have to read like halfway down
before you get to the part where they
say
oh it was actually made for the our rnc
it had nothing to do with
trump needing to you know fire obama
for personal reasons so
you're seeing a lot of that the other
cnn trick nancy pelosi described as the
wrap
up so there's a video of
pelosi actually describing this
technique
as a political dirty trick while he's
using the technique
so there is two different times but you
can see here describing the dirty trick
and then you can watch as as the
democrats use that dirty trick
and uh the the way that works is that
some politician will make a claim and
by itself it may not be persuasive then
you get somebody to write a story
about the politician who made a claim
and now you have two sources
it's really just the one person who made
a claim but now it looks like there's
also a reporter who dug
into it and is backing the claim but
really they just talked to the first
person
now the other media will do the story
about somebody's reaction to the story
so now you've got just one stupid claim
with no evidence
turned into a story about the stupid
claim that's two sources
and now a bunch of the media starts
writing about it and saying different
things
all based on the one source that's now
credible and suddenly
it's national headlines and and you're
dealing with the
well we're not reporting it's true
exactly
which is the dodge they use we're not
saying it's true
we're saying the allegation is out there
and that we asked
this politician so it looks slow hey
looks like they have a new feature on
periscope where it will
put you back into the thing you got
kicked out of which would be a great
feature
yes so i lost the connection there for a
moment but periscope now has a
feature that allows me to get back into
the same periscope which is amazing
i hope that's what's happening all right
let me go on
um as we're watching the black lives
matter
uh protest etc and as we're thinking
more deeply about
everything around there i would like to
suggest that the only standard
we should compare people is by similar
strategies
now maybe similar starting places you
know in other words
uh let's let's compare a poor white kid
to a poor black kid
so let's say they're they're both
starting you know from a
deep hole what if they use the same
strategy to succeed
let's say they both pay attention in
school they
stay in trouble they stay off drugs they
find a mentor
to things that would be obvious good
life strategy
if you were to compare then the outcomes
of let's say the poor black kid who did
everything right
strategy wise to the poor white kid who
also did everything right
how would that look which one would get
the the job which one would be doing
better in 10 years
if you're not looking at that you're
just
involved in something that isn't helpful
which is what black
lives matter is it's completely
unhelpful
and so unhelpful that
at this point american airlines said
that they would allow
their their people to wear a black lives
matter
pin when they're working but they would
not be allowed to wear
let's say a pro-trump pin or something
like that
i think the difference is trump is
political whereas black lives matter is
more of a social good would be their
thinking
but here's what's different
just because of the protests and
everything we've learned about black
lives matter being a marxist
organization
and and what we've seen in terms of
their actual actions the members actions
you can say now in september
of 2020 you can say out loud without
getting canceled
that blm the organization is a racist
organization
now i think i would have been canceled
for that
not too many months ago but now it's
sort of seeped into the
understanding of what's going on to the
point where you really can
just say it out loud hey american
airlines
if you let your employees wear a blm pin
i would personally consider that racist
now i get that you could disagree with
me and i get that you could say no
no we're just trying to make things less
racist that's the whole point of black
lives matter
but would you would you accept that
everybody gets to have an opinion
my personal opinion is that the black
lives
matter movement was well intentioned by
most people
not necessarily the organizers but most
people involved had good intentions for
all the all the right reasons
but nonetheless it has evolved
and fairly recently into i would say a
straight-up
racist organization so if you're not
looking at
comparing people by life and strategies
you are just being a racist
because if you compare people who have
exactly the same strategy
and you found out they still had
different outcomes
well there's your racism because once
you've eliminated
you know the the what you do with your
life
as being different and you've you've you
really got apples and apples at that
point
if there's still a big difference then
i'd have to say
the presumption is racism i'd like to
know how big that is
but you can't know until you compare
people by strategies um
here's an idea for you oh well let me
just mention this
uh i think it was in a molly hemingway
article
uh mentioned that there's a writer for
the washington post named
dan balls dan balz spelled
b-a-l-z now
i've never heard of dan balz i've heard
of his brother harry
harry bowls um and i didn't really have
anything else to say about that
you just should have a brother named
harry
all right um how about this
for a tax plan are you ready
uh so you've heard every kind of tax
plan in the world for
from tax the rich to flat tax to
that to every every other idea but you
haven't heard this one
so this is my very own invention it goes
like this
suppose you based the tax rate
on the top one percent on the outcomes
of the bottom 10 percent ah
so here in in rough terms without
working out the details it would look
like this
your top one percent has a tax rate of x
but if the bottom 10 percent could let's
say
increase their average income
by twenty percent that the top one
percent get to cut their taxes
a little bit just a little bit
and if they can get let's say more of
the the bottom
20 percent to graduate from school
if they can get unemployment down to
some really low level
so the point would be that the top one
percent are not like
everybody else what what
bill gates can do or a
you know any of the billionaires just
name a billionaire jeff jeff bezos
what a bezos or a gates can do in the
world is so much bigger
than what you and i can do they can
actually
change they can change
society by focusing on the right things
and pushing the right levers
so wouldn't you like to see that the top
one percent and again we're just talking
in approximates here
wouldn't you like to see the top one
percent have a self-interest
in helping the bottom 10 percent
directly
because it would lower their own taxes
if you get incentives right you get
everything right if you know how humans
work
if you say to a billionaire i can lower
your taxes by
two percent but you could have to figure
out some way without the government's
help
to fix all this other stuff figure out
how to get the health care for
well maybe that's it figure out how to
get health care for everybody
do whatever you want but figure out how
to get health care for everybody if you
get that
your tax rate goes down two percent just
the top one percent
so this is not a well thought out idea
but i like the idea of the
the most successful having it as their
personal burden
to make the least successful at least
you know get up to
you know the middle range if they can um
there's uh some polls pulling numbers
out of rasmussen
showing a trend which i think is going
to be more pronounced
so wisconsin after
after all the recent troubles it looks
like
um trump has a slightly not
statistically important
but close to a tie and a slight lead in
men
so if the only people of voting in
wisconsin were men
trump would win but he's getting killed
on women so where he's got 48 percent of
men
he's only got 39 percent of women
so that's you know big difference
but here's the interesting part
according to rasmussen
he's got support of 26 percent of blacks
and uh 40
47 of other other meaning
neither white nor black so those would
be more minorities
so he's got 47 percent of non-white
people and 26 percent of blacks are
supporting trump
it looks like the black men
i think are going to trump i feel like
that's what's happening
now we'll see but it's starting to look
as though the democratic party is
becoming a party
dominated by and run by women just as
black lives matter is dominated by
and effectively run by women now if you
don't think
that women are running black lives
matter just look at
the street action it's usually a woman
on a bullhorn
and there's a very funny video i forget
i don't don't know which city was it was
probably
portland or maybe rochester and there
was a video
uh from last night i think there was a
black woman in her car
and she gets stopped by a bunch of
protesters
now from the camera angle that i had
couldn't see everybody but the people
standing directly in front of her car
and blocking her from going wherever she
needed to go might have been home
looked like they were all white so they
look like white supporters
of black lives matter and they're
blocking a car
of an actual black person so all these
like fake larpers are standing in front
of the car blocking
an actual black woman who just wants to
get
home or gets to wherever she wants to go
somebody says it's
north portland and what do you think
happened
so here was the competition there's no
didn't look like there was any law
enforcement anywhere
so it's one lone black woman who's
telling these people to get out of the
way
quite forcefully and a bunch of
white black lives matter people refusing
because they just didn't want anybody to
get through
well if you were born yesterday you
might say to yourself
huh sounds like a fair competition
maybe it'll be a standoff no it wasn't a
standoff
because in the hierarchy of the black
lives matter
world a black woman is the top of the
pile
a black woman outranks a black man
and black people in general outrank
the white supporters of black lives
matter
and i think everybody would agree with
that right that that's the
the rank which has sort of evolved and
i'm not arguing that there's anything
wrong with that
you know if it sounded like i said and
that's a big mistake or something i'm
not saying anything like that
i'm just observing i'm simply observing
that the black lives matter movement is
primarily
female dominated as is the democratic
party in general
not that there aren't plenty of men but
those men are subservient
to the women who are sort of running the
show and you're you're actually seeing
a trend that i predicted a while ago
which is um
has a lot to do with how the genders
you know relate to each other and who
wants to be in charge
really i would say the republicans
are more um more practical about that
that is to say i don't think the
republicans have a sense of who needs to
be in charge
i think if you've got the talent you're
in charge
you know if you work hard you're in
charge if you don't you're not
i think the republican view is who cares
it just doesn't seem to be important
and the democrat view is oh it matters
it matters
all right that is what i wanted to say
today
um if you haven't watched this
somebody somebody tweeted and i
retweeted it
that their favorite entertainment is
watching the police take back a street
because there's a technique that the
police use
that i don't think i'd seen before which
is interesting
when the when the big group of police
form a line and they
they they go at once and sort of attack
the crowd and push it back
there's a thing the police do and i
don't know again i don't know if this is
part training
or it's just a thing that they do but
they'll sometimes just push over a
protester
like just push them off their feet and
have them fall backwards
and then the protester will get up again
and they'll just push him down
if you haven't seen the one that i
tweeted it's just hilarious every time
you watch it
because you see this one police officer
pushed the protester down and the
protester jumps right up and sort of
gets
starts coming at the guy who pushed him
and then the guy pulls down i think it's
a taser
you look like a taser and he starts to
like tase the guy
but before he can his his buddy another
law enforcement guy
runs right in front of him and just
pushes that guy down again
so it's hilarious to watch it's funnier
watching it than
in the telling all right that's all i
got for now
um somebody says trump approval levels
back to pre-covet
that's that's a big problem for the
democrats isn't it
if this vitamin d thing is true and it's
looking good
we're done if it's true
we're done somebody's prompting me to
talk about jake
tapper so there's a story the story goes
that uh
jake tapper um
talked to somebody who was thinking of
running
against a democrat that he liked or
something
and he talked them out of it and so the
the person the subject person ran in a
different race
so that the person allegedly the jake
tapper liked a democrat
would win in his race here's the thing
so jake has denied it when
when asked directly did you do this he
said now
there's other reporting that said yes
this almost certainly falls into that
category of
it sort of depends subjectively
you know if i think if you were if you
heard all the conversations yourself
which you can't
it would probably be closer to
a conversation about the pros and cons
which is different from you should drop
out of the race and save my friend
so i don't feel like i can take sides on
this one
because you would have to hear all the
conversation to have a good
opinion on that and i haven't so
i won't do what the fake news does
which is have an opinion on something
you couldn't possibly know the details
of what really happened
all right
somebody calls this my encore i think
you're right
um
no it didn't blah blah blah yeah i'm not
too interested in the story frankly
oh let's talk about cardi b cardi b
and candace so cardi b
has become interested in politics you
know she interviewed
joe biden you might also know that
candace owens
had some public back and forth with her
and
candace suggested that baby cardi b
should educate herself on the political
stuff
because candace notes that she seems
underinformed now i will
echo what can what canada said
which is i respect i tend to respect any
artist
who succeeds so i'm not a big fan of
music
and i i couldn't even tell you any song
that cardi b
had ever done i don't think i would
recognize it if i heard it i just don't
listen to much music
but that said objectively speaking she's
sensationally
successful so if somebody is
sensationally successful with their art
i say that's good art it's good because
people wanted it
it's good because people bought it you
know there's nothing else you have to
discuss
art is not objective if a whole bunch of
people want to listen to your art
you're an artist end of story so cardi b
i have maximum respect
for her as an artist but i will differ a
little bit
with candace and maybe not even much at
all maybe not at all
but i like the fact that she's involved
in politics
i like it because there's nothing about
her that suggests
that she's done learning right there's
nothing about her cardi b that would
suggest
uh she doesn't want to you know round
out her knowledge of
politics is so she's open to
you know making this a continual you
know
sort of a system in which she's getting
more informed as she goes i say more of
it
let me let me give you this thought
i've talked about it would be good to
have more than a debate
like on tv because the debates on tv are
too limited
the people have they don't have enough
time you got to get to the next
question you basically just doesn't work
but what also would not work is giving
your politicians all the time that they
want
to debate and here's why it wouldn't
work
the politicians will just lie both of
them
doesn't matter who they are both sides
will just sit there
and in the in the context of a debate
they wouldn't say a single thing that
was true because the truth
doesn't work as well so if you're trying
to win a debate that's televised
you're just going to lie through your
teeth because it works better
and i thought to myself how would you
like to see a
debate between cardi b and candace
because presumably candace would be
filling in a lot of blanks
you know just background knowledge that
would be good to have to have an opinion
and you could watch that happen in real
time
with two people who actually want good
things to happen
to the black community into the country
because don't you believe that both
cardi b
and candace are genuinely
interested in the well-being of the of
the country
and i'm i think it goes without saying
interested in the well-being of the
black community
it goes without saying i would love to
see them debate
and if you say to yourself no no scott
because
cardi b might not know as much as some
pundit
might not know as much about politics as
some professional
i say that's okay because the pundit and
the professional are just liars
they're professional liars i don't need
to see a debate
between two professional liars but if
you put
candace and cardi b in front of the
camera and just
just turn it on and just step back
and watch what happens you're gonna end
up smarter
because you're gonna hear something from
canvas that you've never heard before
and you're gonna say really you're going
to look it up
and you're going to find out that's a
thing
so watching candace
let's say respectfully because i think
she would do it respectfully
respectfully fill in the blanks
for cardi b would be really good
that wouldn't even be just worth
watching
that would be the best thing i could
watch
this month not counting the biden riots
which are very entertaining
so let's do it who's with me
wouldn't you like to see that tell me
the truth
you would like to see that and it would
be better than watching the politicians
because there would just be liars
you know i i don't think candace
i don't think has she ever been accused
of lying
i mean i'm sure everybody's been accused
of lying but i would
i would trust candace to come with the
truth if anything she said wasn't 100
accurate it wouldn't be because she
intentionally lied cardi b i see no
reason to think she wouldn't be
completely honest
i would love to see two honest people
have a debate
how often do you see that two honest
people
who actually just want the world to be
better that would be the best debate
of the whole year hands down so let's
let's get that going
i'd love to see it all right that's all
for now talk to you later
