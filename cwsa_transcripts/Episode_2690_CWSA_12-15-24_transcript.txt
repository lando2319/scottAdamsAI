oh let's see if we can get these
comments
working and then your Sunday will
begin all right looking
good Sunday kicking off just right
golden age
[Music]
to good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time in your
whole life but if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that nobody
can even understand with their tiny
shiny human brains all you need for that
is what you know yeah a CER mgar glass a
tanker cheler Stein a Cante Jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liqu I like coffee and join me
now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine here the day thing makes
everything B it's called the
simultaneous Sip and happens
now
go ah thank you Paul I never I never
feel totally comfortable until I see you
tell me that the uh the audio and video
are
working all right would you be surprised
to know that there's a new study that
says coffee is good for you I know it's
not like I don't have one every single
day but this one is uh coffee
consumption correlates with better
cognitive performance and less
inflammation if you've had a
stroke so according to the American
Heart Association so if you have a
stroke and you wake up in the
hospital ask for coffee
also if you didn't have a stroke and you
wake up in the
hospital ask for
coffee also if you didn't go to the
hospital and you feel perfectly
healthy ask for coffee all right I think
you get the picture did you know
according to no Ridge that uh low levels
of vitamin D is a big cause of chronic
inflammation so if you put your vitamin
D right into your coffee
your inflammation doesn't have a chance
you know what I wonder is do we really
know how much vitamin D is the right
amount do you ever
wonder does does every single
human need the same amount like like
what's going on with that so uh anyway
it'll cause your inflammation to go down
and it might if you have inflammation it
could lead to type 2 diabetes heart
disease and autoimmune disorders so so
make sure you got lots of vitamin
D here's the good news that obesity
dipped in the US for adults for the
first time in more than a decade let me
see let me check to see if the
simulation uh did the simulation write
this or was it a legitimate news entity
let's say what's the name of the
reporter who's talking about people
losing weight Denise Chow CH h w
okay
really the the reporter who is writing
about eating too much her last name is
chia come on that's too on the nose for
the
simulation but uh yeah this is mostly
because of the
OIC how many of you have noticed OIC
people have you noticed you can kind of
spot
them uh there there may be people in
your life who for the entire time you've
known them have had some struggle
keeping the weight off and and now they
just look
great and you like
H I think that's a little OIC right
there so I'll tell you one thing I
definitely do not doubt that the OIC
helps people lose
weight no doubt about it in fact in fact
it might be one of the most successful
drugs in terms of the efficacy that I've
ever seen I mean it's amazing
I do worry about any side effects but I
suppose we'll find
out now how many of you uh are on a and
saw that I posted a uh a shirtless
selfie of myself at the beach uh that
looked a little too good did anybody
notice that and I I put at the top uh
haters will say this is AI and of course
it was AI I I hate to break it to you
but I didn't think anybody would believe
it but based on the comments probably a
good 25% of the people who saw thought
that I'd been really working out
well and the the photo I'm not going to
show it to you because some people just
puke when they see
it uh the uh the photo was basically
somebody who really really work on a lot
and I'm I'm pretty fit for my age but no
that wasn't me so in case you're
wondering
it wasn't but here's here's the reason
for bringing it up at all oh there it is
it's in the comments if you're on locals
you can see it in the
comments um what's interesting is that
people ran it through
AI to get AI to tell them if it was a
real photo or
Ai and I think people ran it through
grock for grock to determine if it was
Ai and grock said no probably not 70%
chance is real
I think it was made by
grock I think grock made an image that
was so good that grock couldn't tell
that grock made it I think that's what
happened but I didn't make the image
myself so but I think it was
grock anyway uh there was a tornado in
California in a place called Scotts
Valley now if you think to yourself
Scott I didn't even know you had your
own Valley well I do but that's not what
this is uh there is a place called
Scotts Valley that has nothing to do
with me which seems wrong it should have
something to do with me um but it was an
actual tornado some people say there was
one touchdown here in California in 2005
or something but didn't make a lot of
news I guess
so I still don't know if that Freight
Train sound that I heard yesterday was a
tornado trying to touchdown where live
but I've never heard anything like it
and some of the neighbors think that's
what it might have been so I don't know
don't know could have been it could have
been um just Thunder that didn't sound
like regular Thunder for some
reason meanwhile in Japan they've
developed a drug that can regrow human
teeth like in your
body so you you take a shot and your
adult teeth grow back in if they're not
there I guess but what if you already
have adult teeth does it does the new
stuff push the old teeth out I have
questions how how could your body know
when to grow a tooth and when not to
wouldn't it grow teeth everywhere and
then just push your old ones out like
baby teeth get pushed out well I don't
know that but apparently it's a real
thing it's already developed and it's
already tested and they showed a
reporter a reporter who was looking at
her own teeth and was like oh my God
there's two new teeth just started
growing I don't know I'm not I'm not
sure I totally believe that now the the
purpose is for people with lost teeth
the purpose is not for somebody who has
already a full a full mouth of good
teeth
anyway I guess all it does is block a
protein and that's all it needed to do
that's all it needed to do it was easy
meanwhile the Malibu fire is pretty
pretty too bad it's been a few days now
and it's uh threatening some Hollywood
leits like Jay-Z Beyonce and Lady Gaga
so many of them are evacuating their
homes U Mark
haml was described as being stranded I
don't I don't think stranded I hope I
hope it doesn't mean that he can't get
out I hope that's not what we're talking
about but uh it sounds bad but uh I
would like to point out that have you
ever thought to yourself as I
have wouldn't it be great this is
something I thought let's say a year
ago I thought wouldn't it be amazing to
be
Jay-Z I mean imagine what what it's like
you got all the money you've married
Beyonce you're famous you came from the
streets you made everything work despite
all your obstacles in between and he's
not really having a good year though so
he's being dragged into of course the
didy stuff and he's got some accusations
about him but now his his house might be
uh at risk of burning down
um that's like a really bad ear so it
makes you think maybe there's something
to
Carmon maybe there's something he did
that is getting paid for I don't
know this this is one of the reasons I
always think that if the first part of
your life was extra
bad then the universe owes
you has anybody tried that that's one of
my reframes one of my reframes is that
the the universe just owes
you if you had a bad
childhood all right um grock according
to Brian romelli who knows a lot about
AI um grock is now beating open AI
across the board so basically in all the
metrics it's beating it and then Elon
weighed in on that post on X and said
that uh Gro three is uh will be a major
Leap
Forward
so so Elon Musk starts
late because he had originally invest
invested $50 million in open Ai and
somehow Sam Alman and Microsoft found a
way to turn his investment into their
investment
I I still don't know how they pulled
that off how do you take $50 million
from somebody and turn it into your
investment it's not the not the
investment of the person who invested a
50 million how in the world did they
pull that off but anyway the it looks
like uh mus is going to get his revenge
so he starts
late says some kind of a world record
for building a data center he's already
lapped the competition and when he gets
his latest upgrade he will probably have
an advantage they can never catch up to
how is that
possible you know I get the idea that
Elon Musk is a good
entrepreneur I get that he's a good
engineer I get that he's good at a range
of things that all come together for the
things he does but really how in the
hell do you have yet another
success like this so quickly it doesn't
seem possible does it like how can you
dominate space electric cars satellites
and then somebody says AI is a big thing
oh okay well give me give me nine months
and then what I'm just making up that
number but in nine months he's leading
the entire industry of the entire
planet how how does he do this
this is really weird and you know if I
guess a lot of you have had the same
thought if anybody else in the world
literally anybody literally anybody this
is not hyperbole but literally anybody
else on the whole eight billion people
on Earth any other person if they were
in charge of Doge I would
say that's not going to happen you know
they'll run into the brick wall W
they'll find out it's impossible can't
be
done Elon Musk is literally the only
only person on Earth you know of course
he's working with v so he's got you know
two superpowers uh at
least he's the only person that I would
say to myself you know what I think
that's going to work there's not a
single other person on the whole
freaking planet that I would say that
about that's pretty amazing pretty
amazing but the fact that he made a AI
already leading in the
field I don't even have words to
describe that how do you how do you even
describe what we're we're get we're so
lucky to be alive when this is
happening you know I often think um I
feel sorry for anybody who is a
basketball fan who was born after
Michael Jordan left the league did you
ever think about that imagine being a
basketball fan and you missed the
Michael Jordan era now if you don't if
you don't care about sports that doesn't
mean much to you but I mean that'll be a
big difference so being alive when Elon
Musk is doing his thing and he's at he
seems to be at his prime um is just
breathtaking it really
is meanwhile there's a robot according
to writers that can herd
cattle and it's so smart it can kind of
heard the cattle over to what part of
the field they haven't overgrazed and
you can tell if he tell you if they
knows if the cattle are in good health
or not so that's pretty cool so that's a
a case of the robots taking my old job
it used to be my job at my uncle's dairy
farm um to go and get the cows out of
the big 400 Acres of field and get them
back to the barn so they could be milked
in the evening and I would get paid 25
cents uh every time I got the cows it
was called getting the cows that was the
name of the job it's your job to get the
cows so 25 cents I would go out in the
field and get them the very first day I
took over for my older
brother he was an expert at getting the
cows and I was a rookie but my first day
um I was told it would be kind of easy
because you know the dog does most of
the work there's a sheep dog yeah it's
like it's like a hurting dog but the dog
does mostly work you basically just go
out where the cows are and then the dog
knows what it has to do and it rounds up
the cows and the cows are kind of
trained you know they know they get fat
at night so it's a really easy job you
just sort of walk out there and then the
dog collects them all up and you got
your 25 cents so I walk out there and
the cows start walking like in the
opposite direction I'm like what the
hell what's wrong with you cows don't
you know you're all trained to go the
other direction and then they started
dispersing like they weren't even going
in the same direction they it was like
they knew the new guy was starting they
all started spreading
out and next thing I knew I was lost in
the
swamp and it was getting dark and it was
before
cellones and not only had I lost all of
the cows all of them I couldn't find a
sign single
cow but I'd lost the
dog that's right you can't you can't
heard cows any worse than
that yeah I lost all of the
cows it was dark I was in a swamp and I
lost the dog and I didn't know how to
get
home I had no idea how to get out of the
swamp so as luck would have it I hear
somebody calling my name eventually
Scott Scott
so my uncle had formed a search party to
go find me when the cows and the dog and
I had all disappeared and so they found
me and I'm like oh finally you know uh
I'm saved but I felt really bad CU I'd
lost all of the
cows and the dog the worst farmer
ever and finally I got up the courage to
say because I might have been I don't
10 years old or something 11 maybe and I
got up the courage to say I I I lost a
dog and they said
what they said I I I lost not just the
cows but I I lost the
dog and my uncle said no the dog already
got the
cows so while I was lost in the swamp
the dog had hered up all the cows
because it was trained to do that and
they were already back in the barn
I think I still got paid 25% or 25
cents didn't deserve it meanwhile
speaking of paying ABC News is is going
to pay $15 million to Trump to settle a
defamation lawsuit because George
stenopus had said during one of their
interviews that Trump was quote found
liable for
rape now I can't believe how many even
Trump supporters have gotten this one
wrong including me including me um there
was a time when I believed
incorrectly that he had not been found
guilty in a criminal way so I knew that
but I thought that he had been found
liable for the rape in some kind of a
civil suit but that that wasn't the
point of the suit the suit was about
whether he had you know lied about her
lying I guess so it was more about lying
about her lying it wasn't about the rape
per se so there is no court there is no
court that has a
finding that he raped
anybody just speaking purely from a you
know political from a uh Court's
perspective so I guess that was enough
for him to win that lawsuit and uh
George
stenopus H has to apologize
too they have to apologize guys that's
the best
part but as Mike cernovich points out uh
ABC News probably desperately wanted to
avoid uh a court process where there
could have been U their emails may have
had to been turned over imagine how many
things you would find out about ABC News
if you had access to their emails do you
think there would be any other
indications that they were just backing
the Democrats
that was free money I think just suing
them and putting up the possibility that
they would look through their emails was
enough for them to say ah how much do
you need here's 15
million now imagine how many other
entities the Trump Administration could
do the same thing
with so the the game here which I guess
maybe they just discovered or they knew
and I didn't the game here is to get
them to not want to show you the rest of
their
email so it's not even about the
specific question and the specific 15
million although that's you know it's
not chump change
um so so maybe Trump could just roll up
all the the network news he could
probably do every one of them because
every one of them made up stuff that
they knew to be untrue imagine if he
sued over the fine people hoax
think about all the things he could sue
over maybe I don't
know
meanwhile um Nathan Wade the uh
boyfriend of fonny Willis he admitted
now that he worked with the white house
while he was trying to prosecute Trump
in
Georgia that's right we now have on
record that the prosecutor that was the
boyfriend of fonnie Willis so she chose
her boyfriend and the boyfriend started
colluding with the wife White House and
he had to admit that to the house
Judiciary Committee that he met with
White House staff several
times and that he had to brush up on
RICO
law so is that as damning as it looks to
me it is this a case where there's more
chance that the prosecutor will go to
jail than the accused
I think at this point there's more
chance that the the prosecution will go
to jail than
Trump and I think we all knew
this yeah Trump has so far the best
third act the only thing we need is
proof that any one of our elections were
recently rigged if he gets that which he
doesn't have but if he gets
that there's your third
act meanwhile
Daniel Penny was invited to the Army
Navy game and I guess uh Trump was there
and Elon was there and the um some other
polit some other uh top ranking
Republicans were there and here's what I
love about
this here's what I love about
it I don't think this is good for
Trump's um
anything it was just the right thing to
do that's what I love about it I don't
think Trump cuz Trump remember he
doesn't have to run again I think this
is just something that you will
be disliked a little bit more by the
people who already dislike him but it's
just simply the right thing to
do and I really love that I love seeing
the right thing get done I love seeing
Justice I love seeing um Daniel peny
come out not just even but ahead I hope
it comes on ahead and uh everything
about this is good just great meanwhile
pollster an
Selzer uh you remember her she was the
pollster who said that uh KL Harris was
like way ahead in in Iowa and it was
such an outlying number that people
wondered if she intentionally was lying
and faking her own pole well she's here
to tell you that she did
not do anything untar or
unethical but I'd like to read I'd like
to read you uh her actual words all
right so remember she's being accused
this is Anne Selzer poster who recently
retired but she was accused
of you know kind of intentionally faking
the pole and she goes was on a show uh
local Iowa show to make sure that you
know that she would never do anything
like that but listen to the exact words
she
uses when she denies it okay and what I
want you to look for is where she denies
it so I'm going to read your her denial
and then see if you can find a denial in
the denial you ready so listen carefully
try to find the
denial uh she said and the allegations I
take very seriously those would be the
allegations that she somehow rigged her
own pole they're saying that this was an
election interference which is a
crime so the idea that I intentionally
set set up to deliver this response when
I've never done that before I've had
plenty of opportunities to do it it's
not my ethic but to suggest without a
single shred of evidence that I was in
cahoots with somebody that I was being
paid by somebody it's all just kind of
it's hard to pay too much attention to
it except that they're accusing me of a
crime what's
missing the
denial there's no
denial she's just saying that the
situation is such that she shouldn't
have been
questioned that's not a
denial she's saying that if she did that
it would be opposite of her
ethic which is not a denial
she's saying it's very serious because
it's a
crime which is not a
denial she says she's never done that
before even though she's had plenty of
opportunities that's not a denial that's
uh I could have easily done it and that
to suggest within a single shred of
evidence has also nothing to do with a
denial because how would we have any
evidence of what she did privately we
wouldn't have any evidence we would just
look at the result and say well that you
know obviously you knew that wasn't
real so and then I would uh if you if
you're
curious you should look at her body
language because if I were a body
language expert and I were looking for
signs of somebody was being
deceptive well I'll let you judge for
yourself I'm no body language expert and
I'm not a mind reader but if I were
innocent I wouldn't be looking like that
that's all I'm saying so there's
something uh that didn't quite land if
she was trying to get herself out of the
uh out of the let's say the accusation
area MSNBC had a guest on talking about
vaccines with Chris
Hayes um so Brandy
zed zed
rosney uh is joining the theatrical
people who are mad at RFK
Jr now um if I've taught you how to be
mad at RFK Jr you have to do it with
like a disgust an attitude that shows
your superiority so this is important
you have to look arrogant and Superior
and you have to sort of ignore what RFK
Jr actually says and instead
imagine he said or meant something
different so here here's a way you can't
do it this would be the wrong way to do
it well you know RFK Jr makes a number
of claims but uh according to the
science that I trust the most um I don't
think those claims are uh are
accurate so that's what you would say if
you were making some kind of a logical
argument and then maybe you'd show your
sources and stuff like that here's what
you would do if you're just trying to
defend your point of view and you don't
have anything else it would go like this
and RFK Jr well he's he's making
the it's like doesn't believe in
science you know so you got to make the
face and show the attitude but then
don't show anything to actually debunk
his point of view cuz they don't have
anything to debunk his actual point of
view here's what they do have ways to
misinterpret his point of view to make
him sound dumb so you have something to
say about it on
TV all
right um so Chris Hayes said oh so first
of all
um the guest was saying that uh there is
not a vaccine that Kennedy thinks is
safe or
effective okay does that mean that he
says all of them are bad because that's
what it sounds like right if you said
there's not a vaccine that Kennedy
thinks is safe or effective you would
think to yourself is he saying that
they're all unsafe no he says very
clearly I'm not saying all vaccines are
bad he says it directly and often but
she wants to say there's not a vaccine
that Kennedy thinks is safe and
effective here here's what he does say
there's not a vaccine that's been tested
adequately that he does say that right
so of course it it is also fair to say
that he doesn't know that any of them
are safe and
effective he doesn't know because they
haven't been tested to his level of
satisfaction or mine either and they
there's a uh there's a thought out
there that the polio vaccine may not
have been eradicating polio but it just
sort of happened at exactly the same
time that there were some changes in the
world about I know hygiene and cleaner
water washing your hands or some damn
thing now I suspect If This Were studied
you would find that the polio vaccine
works but have they all been studied to
the level that you would be satisfied
with well here's what Chris hay says he
says quote Kennedy was like they should
be studied I was like I think we've got
the studies like I think we studied it
pretty damn well do you see how I added
the theatrical part see make I'm going
to say it again but I'm going to act
like Kennedy's really
dumb Kennedy's like they should be
studied I'm like we've got the studies
like uh We've studied it pretty damn
well we studied it pretty damn well do
you know what the truth
is none of them are a double bind study
which is the only gold standard
study so then Chris a says quote the
other thing is that we do randomize
controlled trials and double blind
randomized controlled trials in the
process of approving all the time that
is how we get them that is how we know
they're safe and
effective none of that's
true that's C
whole point is that people think and I
thought this I always believe that they
did some kind of randomized double blind
trial nope nope they do not do a
randomized double blind trial not
typically and not
even
often the reason you can't do a double
blind trial probably is because you
can't leave some people untreated or
something like
that anyway so MS NBC is telling its
audience that the vaccines are not only
safe they've been studied pretty damn
well and they are the subject of
randomized controlled trials and double
blind randomized almost none of this is
accurate according to RFK Jr as as best
I understand his
claims so do you think that MSNBC
depends on any drug companies for their
funding I don't know or maybe it's just
automatically you have to disagree with
anything that's good for
Trump I don't
know so I have a my my personal opinion
on vaccines is almost certainly some of
them are good for you almost certainly
not every one of them is good for
you that's all I know
but we'll find out Mark andreon has been
talking about uh the collapse of a
preference Cascade or maybe it's just
without the collapse part a preference
Cascade and this is a kind of an
interesting concept that i' not heard
before but immediately embraced and the
idea if I understand it is that you can
have times in society where people are
simply pretending to
believe what they think they have to
pretend to believe in
public but if everybody's
pretending then you have a possibility
that when some Brave person stops
pretending and says wait a minute wait a
minute every bit of this is and
you all know it then suddenly all the
people were just trying to stay out of
the you know stay out of the heat just
by saying oh yeah sure it's true uh yeah
whatever I believe that that they can
now change to the opinion of the Brave
person and that there's something called
a preference
Cascade now what makes it interesting is
how fast it can happen because if you
had to change people's minds like where
they really held a genuine opinion and
it was their own opinion and they got
there through their own thinking or
whatever if you had to change their
minds almost never it's just I mean I I
study persuasion all the time and it's
just hard to change anybody's mind about
anything you know deeply that's a deeply
held belief
but there can be times when people PR
prend to have a deeply held belief but
they absolutely don't believe
it they just know they have to say it in
public and so the the thinking is that
there were way more anti-biden and prot
Trump people in the country than anybody
was willing to say out
loud and that when Trump
won uh that was probably something about
a preference Cascade where people's to
stop well they could they had the option
of not
pretending they had the option of not
pretending that they believed so once
enough famous people and I think Elon
Musk is the the number one uh thing
because it we we had a country where
people sort of genuinely
believed um for good reason that Elon
Musk was unusually
smart and that that he was very much on
the side of America doing well and when
you see somebody who's way smarter than
you are and is really paying attention
to the
topic and definitely wants the country
to do well it's hard to say your opinion
is the opposite of
that but it also makes it easier if
you're going to switch your opinion
you're switching it to a side that looks
credible then RFK Jr added a lot you you
take RFK Jr and say okay the most famous
Democrat political family in the world
Clinton's maybe second uh if somebody
like that can take the enormous enormous
hit his family his reputation everything
um his marriage just everything if he
could take that kind of a hit because he
thinks it's important that's very
influential and it doesn't take too many
people to change their state reference
before you have this preference Cascade
that just goes House of
Cards so it looks like that might be
what's
happening so pretend opinions are being
discarded all right you know we're going
to have to talk about the
drones there's you know I love this
story I totally I totally love this
story about the drones partly because
it's a good mystery like I I genuinely
don't know what's going on but I do
think we can now narrow it down so we
let's talk about
that so there are many there are many
theories that have been
promoted
um but the the theory that makes the
most sense is that the government is
lying would everybody agree with that do
are we all on the page that the
government is obviously lying because I
don't think there's anybody who thinks
that they're trying hard to figure out
what this is what the Drone stuff is so
obviously it's our stuff so it's
obviously stuff that's made by human
beings on Earth it I mean it has running
lights and all the human stuff so we
know it's human-made it's not
aliens um You probably saw a picture in
the news of one thing that looked like
this this uh gyrating orb thing that
looked almost like a I don't know
hologram or
something then somebody smart said oh no
that's just a camera you know odity if
you focus on a distant light sometimes
it'll look like it's jumping around like
a
hologram so the only thing that we've
seen for sure are human-made
crafts so even when people said I saw an
orb or I saw something coming out of the
water probably none of that checks that
but definitely there are lots of cfts so
one thing we could say is there are lots
of them I think as of today for the
first time I'm moving to the opinion
that it's happening in more than one
place um I was convinced it was
happening in New Jersey but I thought it
was still possible that the other ones
are fake sightings you know just people
being influenced by the one place that's
really happening but now I think that it
seems likely it's happening on the west
coast and on the East Coast at the same
time so i' would say it's definitely
American it's American Products it's
definitely in more than one place it's
definitely over an extended period of
time which is
interesting um I do believe it that the
drones themselves do not represent a
risk because the government knows what's
happening and if it were
risk if it were that risk I think they
tell us and they'd be shooting them down
if they
could so it's ours it's military I think
it's obvious that a lot of the people
who are in the government would not have
the clearance to know exactly what's
going on so I don't think they're lying
I think well the top guys are lying
obviously but the uh most people like
Mayors and governors there's no way that
they've been filled in on whatever this
is so definitely not
UFOs definitely not not
adversaries definitely American stuff
definitely military and or CIA but you
know same thing for this context um
definitely happening in more than one
place definitely happening over an
extended period of
time now the next question is
why and I'll give you two hypotheses
that so far seem to be the leading
candidates
number one um apparently the US has
devices that can hover but also have
fixed Wings they'd be called they're
called VLS or vertical takeoff and
Landing we know that we have manned
aircraft that can do it but we also know
that we have drones unmanned drones that
are designed to take off from a ship at
Sea and people say that the drones are
coming from the direction of the ocean
so they're coming from a ship as SE
and they're designed to go to a base on
land or maybe some military conflict
area and they're mostly for bringing
largish at least as large as a drone can
carry um Goods back and forth so if you
need ammo or you need to take something
out I guess it would work in that we
also know that since these already exist
but it doesn't look like that's what
we're
seeing it looks like it could be the new
model model in other words this could be
the upgraded versions of the ones we
know about and somebody who pretended to
know something about it mentioned the
name of the model of the Drone and you
can get a picture of it online and it
looks like it might be the thing where
the new ones might be the thing so so
hypothesis number one is they're just
testing new
drones does that fit the facts they're
just testing new drug now that would
include perhaps if they're trying to
test one kind of drone against another
kind of
drone um now that could ex that could
explain the extended time
frame because if you're building a drone
and you're trying to sell it one of the
main selling features is how long it can
operate without being charged and how
long you can operate it before it has to
be taken out of service so it could be
that they just have to put these into
service for you know two months in a row
in order for the military to say all
right here's your $10 billion make us
more of these now we know that they last
two months at least could be that but do
you believe that if there were no danger
to the public they would that the
government would allow the public to be
this worried and that they would be
testing these devices over residential
areas without telling us
because if there's anybody in the chain
of command who okayed testing in a
residential area and creating the Panic
that we're seeing now that person would
definitely be fired am I wrong there is
100% chance that if anybody in the
military authorized testing in a
residential area and over our nuclear
facilities or over our nuclear well I
guess the military bases wouldn't be a
problem because they'd be in on it but
that doesn't really track does it do you
believe that they would do it for
months months or at least over a month
right do you think they do it for over a
month letting everybody panic and see it
and not tell us it's just a
test doesn't really track does it now
the other
hypothesis is that they're trying to uh
detect something or search for something
and the people want to scare us the most
say oh there's there's a rumor of
missing nuclear weapon uh from
Ukraine and maybe somebody snuck it into
the country maybe our intelligence
people know it they don't want us to
panic but they're not so sure it's here
that they want to tell you to
leave but they've got a little bit of
suggestion that it might be here so
they're checking
so if they knew it was here I don't
think they'd stop at 11: p.m. would you
agree if they knew they really knew that
there was some nuclear weapon of mass
destruction that a terrorist had moved
onto the mainland of the United States
if they knew
it they'd be looking longer than than
11: p.m. 11: p.m. seems like when you
quit because you know nobody wants to
work too long and work
overtime that feels like more of a a
business as usual situation it doesn't
sound like an emergency
situation and then there's also the
question of what what they can detect so
apparently the drones can detect
radiation but it's far less likely they
could detect let's say a nuclear warhead
that was shielded properly so if it's
something shielded properly there's no
way they're going to detect it but if it
was some external radiation problem but
also chemical and biological
weapons so apparently some of the drones
can detect chemical
warfare
now would they really need to do that
though because people would be dropping
like flies if they had already been
deployed or is it possible that if
anybody had shipped any of those things
into the country that it's never
completely secure so maybe they could
sniff out because it's not like the
biological
stuff would necessarily be you know
perfectly sealed by the bad
guys
so here's the bottom line can we rule
out uh business as usual ordinary
testing on the military I'm going to
rule that out and by the way that was my
my first choice but it's going on too
long and the public is way too panicked
for them not to say oh it's almost over
don't worry we did a little testing we
can't tell you why we had to do it over
a residential area but trust us if we
hadn't done it over a residential area
we'd be a little bit weaker as a
military and the the testing gave us a
lot of you know good information we
can't tell you more than that but we do
have drones that can operate in deserts
and overseas and now we know that they
can operate in our most dense populated
areas
um we didn't want to tell you what we
were doing because then the adversaries
would would check it out something like
that I'm not going to buy that it
doesn't completely
fit so what about the one where they're
trying to detect some kind of problem to
me that seems pretty likely that they're
look they're trying to detect but I
don't really see them operating in a way
that looks like they're detecting in a
organized gridlike
pattern the the flights seem a little
bit more random than that although they
do seem to go from Ocean to
land they don't appear to be doing
anything any kind of a grid I mean we
would notice that if they were doing
some kind of a extended you know
grid-like pattern which is the only
thing you do if you're looking for
something so it doesn't seem like
they're looking for
something in the way that you would
expect them to act if they were looking
for something now somebody smart said
that if they were looking for radiation
that's why they would do it at night
because at night the sun is on the other
side of the earth and apparently the sun
gives a little background radiation that
makes it harder to detect the stuff
you're looking for but but just being at
night doesn't seem enough to go for the
radiation
um yeah so so it doesn't it doesn't look
like they know there's an iMed mediate
emergency or else they would work past
11:
p.m. it doesn't look like they're
sensing for any biological or
radiation
issues because I don't think they're low
enough and slow enough and uh they don't
seem to be doing a pattern that would
make sense
there so what's left well now we get
into the real you know 4chan stuff
um so it comes from two different
sources that one is highly credible and
one is highly not credible on this topic
credible but not on this
topic so there's the Charlie Kirk theory
that it's basically an OP of some kind
and that they're um maybe setting us up
for something to come or but but
basically it's a it's a psychological
operation to gain something bigger like
the overthrow of the country something
like that some way to thw Trump make it
look like there's more of a thing
happening you know make it look like
there's some kind of invasion that they
have to stop and then they have to need
they need you maybe they need martial
law before Trump gets sworn in oh oh
we're we're being attacked by something
uh uh we can't do a orderly transfer of
power because you know something like
that
now that's Charlie Kirk and other people
I would say they're not they're not
military experts and although I can't
rule it out I can't rule it out because
remember I've already ruled out
everything else so so whatever it is is
going to be something that a normal
person would have ruled out just think
about that whatever it is whatever is
the real answer it's probably something
that a reasonable well-informed person
has already ruled out as a possibility
so whatever the hell this is it's not
normal right it won't be routine
whatever it
is but will it be some big Advanced
psychological operation to take control
of the
country well I wouldn't take Charlie
Kirk's word for it although Charlie Kirk
is very effective and smart and good at
what he does
uh but
then he's not the only one talking about
it here's the
problem uh you're also seeing things
from
uh uh General Mike
Flynn now General Mike Flynn clearly
knows a lot more than you and I know
about what militaries have or have not
considered so somebody who really knows
the good stuff is saying this on x
um if you don't like the weather just
wait a few minutes if you don't like the
wars we were involved in just wait a few
minutes what's next martians landing on
maralago remember this is General Mike
Flynn he says fifth generation Warfare
is real the drones and the threats they
pose are very real our military's hand
are clearly tied because we the US
military has the full compliment of
capabilities to stop it so he's noting
that we could stop easily but we're not
trying to the White House is purposely
allowing this to happen to further
complicate the smooth transfer of
power do not kid yourself for one
second okay now I'm
worried if you see a civilian telling
you that the military might have some
clever plan the first thing I say every
time even if I'm the one who's saying it
is well civilian like like what do you
really know
about the you know the Deep workings of
the military but then somebody who
actually does know the Deep workings of
the military says kind of the same thing
kind of the same thing as Charlie Kirk
so if the general is
Right Charlie Kirk's
right I'm not there yet I'm not there
yet I'm not I'm not yet at the point
where I think that the only reason for
this is to
somehow complicated transfer of
power however let us speculate about all
the things that could
be could it be that somebody has a plan
to take out the
inauguration with a
drone and could it be that if you've had
a month of drones everywhere that the
military is decided or
safe that that's the perfect setup for
explaining why you let a drone through
your Defense Net and took out the
inauguration
right the the only thing I can think of
that would make this drone swarm makes
sense is if later you wanted to use a
real dangerous drone but you wanted to
do it in the context where you could
explain why nobody stopped it and then
the military would say well honestly
there were 50 drones in there how did we
know to stop this
one right so if you put 50 drones in the
air every
day and then there's this one extra
drone that jogs out of the usual place
and shows up in DC at exactly the wrong
time takes out takes out the
leadership you're actually going to
wonder if the military did it or the
military simply was doing some training
exercises that had the terrible terrible
effect of making it impossible to know
what the real threat was versus all the
drones in the
air
so if if this is what it looks like and
of course it probably isn't because
we're just
guessing um if it really is some kind of
way to complicate or make a mass a mass
event event casualty event
possible
uh we really have a problem with their
military if that's the case but I don't
think uh I'm not ready to embrace that
theory yet but we do know let's see um
Senator Chris Smith of New Jersey saying
massive Invasion and he says some are
circling military bases and shadowing
co- Guard
boats I don't know if any of those kinds
of stories are real
the types of stories I don't believe are
that an orb trans transmogrified into a
fix wi plane I because I watched one on
video that did that and all it is is the
when the big light that's shining in
your eyes gets close enough you can see
the rest of the vehicle it's not
transforming it's just you can see it
better when it's close so I think the
the
transmog
transmogrifications are fake I think
that when people say they saw it come
out of the ocean it didn't literally
come from
underwater I doubt I think it was on a
ship parked off the coast which was the
ordinary way it happens so it would be
ordinary if there was a military ship
with some drones on it that could do
this that was parked off the coast in
New Jersey that would be just
ordinary um let's see what else the what
about the drones following the the Coast
Guard well
it's possible that it's one of those
it's possible that they weren't
following it they just happened to be
going in the same direction for a little
while it's possible that that was part
of the training just to see if they
could follow something it's possible
that they were testing some sensors to
see if they could sense something on the
on the Coast Guard boat and it was just
a test that seems unlikely seems like
they would have told the Coast Guard um
so I would say anything that's off
everything that's off the basic things
we know for sure you should not trust so
the things we know for sure I think it's
military is fixed Wing probably they're
vetal kinds that can hover in one place
um probably it's something
new and probably our you know our top
military knows what it is that's the all
we know all all the weird stuff you know
the glowing orbs and the things that
it's probably just bad photography and
old video and some combination of other
stuff
um and then state Senator John bramnick
on news Nation he said quote there must
be something going on that they can't
tell us because they're so fearful of
what the Public's going to do when they
hear what the drones are
doing
or the real test is what happens to the
public if they don't know what's going
on up there so it could be a
psychological operation to just find out
what how we
react maybe I don't know
so
um and then then we hear that the
government might be lying about these
drones never being in restricted
airace because uh uh according to
Michael shellenberger
they have been they have been in
restricted
airspace regularly like routinely
they're in restricted airspace so does
that make sense if they're just doing a
test do you think that the military
would do a test and the in the United
States where it would routinely be in
sensitive areas
or is going to these sensitive areas
exactly what they should be doing
because they're looking for trouble and
there might be TR around let's say a
nuclear power plant or or a military
facility um so the the
missing
um the nuke sniffer is real so what we
don't know is if it's possible to find a
nuke with some drones that don't look
everywhere and just occasionally fly
over your
house I don't know it it doesn't look
like that's what's happening
all right so it's either a
test or a psychological
op
or something or they're trying to detect
something so maybe we'll find out I
don't know um so as you know Joe Biden's
doing a lot of Pardons and
commutations and uh he's looks like he's
on track to do he's already done over
8,000 pardons 8 ,000 how does that
compare to past presidents well let's
see uh Gerald Ford 409 Nixon
922nd uh Reagan
46 Clinton 459 George W 200 Barack Obama
1900 and Trump
237 so the two biggest ones by far were
Barack Obama and Joe Biden
now do you think there's any chance
they're not selling
these
really how how do you pardon 8,000
people unless you're selling them now
why would you do so many pardons are
they all paying no you would do 8,000
pardons so it's not so obvious which
ones paid you if you did 100 Pardons and
you know five of those people paid you
directly or indirectly you might be easy
to find five out of 100 but could you
find five out of
8,000 would you ever put the time in to
look for them to me this 8,000 number
just screams
corruption like what wasn't there a
point when politicians tried to at least
remove the impression remove the
impression that they were doing
something illegal like you don't even
want to leave the
impression well no
8,000 pardons just screams I'm guilty of
something terrible like really really
bad I don't
know meanwhile uh Trump has announced
that uh Richard grenell will serve as
the presidential Envoy for special
missions and uh two special missions
that were noted would be hotspots such
as Venezuela and North
Korea now I have questions
my my first observation is that in the
dilber comic
Universe uh Wall-E is the one who
usually gets put on the special project
because when I worked in Corporate
America special projects were used for
two different things one something very
important that you put your best people
on or two a way to get rid of your worst
people so you put them on the special
project that wasn't that important the
special project project doesn't work out
or is completed then you say well we
don't need you anymore because the
Project's over so it's actually a way
way to fire people who are incompetent
while never ever having to say they're
incompetent if you don't feel
comfortable saying
that so but Richard grenell would be
more like a superstar so he wouldn't be
a at least as far as I know I mean his
reputation is pretty stellar so he
wouldn't be like a Wall-E he would be
put where really makes a difference and
the president thinks he can get some
leverage but I I have to ask this
question and I can't tell if this is
Trump being
awesome uh or not so you tell
me so Richard grenell famously is gay
and you know public about it and um I've
always loved the fact that Republicans
are only looking at his his
capabilities and I never hear anybody
talk about the gay part because don't
care you know do can you do the job yes
we're done so Republicans are very
open-minded when it comes to getting a
job done are you good for this job yes
or no yes well we're done the the other
stuff that's your business
so so I think we're all good with it in
America finally right finally get to the
point where we we can stop obsessing
about the things we shouldn't have
obsessed about in the first place but is
that who you want to send to North Korea
so my question is not about America
because I think we passed the test we
passed the test thank you by the way
thank you to Richard grenell for making
it easy for America to pass the test
because he performs and then we say
we're done good thanks do more of that
but what if he goes to North Korea
how does North Korea treat the lgbtq
community and if it's not
good does that make him the most
effective person to be in that realm or
here's the awesome
part what if we know it's a
problem and decided to do it
anyway which is kind of baller if you
think about it what if we know it's a
problem and decided to do it
anyway I might love that I might kind of
love
it because I think one of the
ways that Trump can help the LGBT
community globally is exactly this you
know you you hire an ambassador or
somebody you know is going to be dealing
with the other country and somebody that
you know is not super cool with the LGBT
community so we just make sure that they
have to deal with one and if they're
dealing with one that's extra good at
their job like Richard grenell then what
you've done for the LGBT community is
tremendous and then maybe you also solve
some big problems in some
hotspots so here's what I would say
about this given that it's my my
assumption that some of the other
countries are not going to be totally
cool with an lbtq member you know being
in a job in their country because
they're less let's say less uh less uh
open-minded than Americans
are at the moment if if Trump could get
a twofer by having somebody who's so
capable that he could essentially change
the way other countries are thinking
about this topic that's sort of the
ultimate confidence isn't it imagine
being so confident that you think not
only could Richard grenell get the job
done he might change how the world
thinks
about
lgbtq that's pretty baller if you think
about it so and and you you wouldn't do
this unless you knew the person you were
sending was
A++ if you send your B+
person you're going to lose you're not
going to get the project done but you're
also going to make the lgbtq thing worse
because then those leaders will say well
they sent us this guy why don't they
send us you know the usual bigoted
stuff
so I love that then uh Trump apparently
picked Devin
Nunes uh to be the chairman of his
intelligence Advisory board so there's
going to be an Advisory Board to keep an
eye on the intelligence community and
Devon Nunes will be the head of that
how perfect is
that how much do you love that like if
you haven't been following politics for
a long time you don't know Devon Nunes
uh had been the head of truth right
truth social um so he had been out of
politics but supportive of trump of
course but when he was in politics he
was the one of the main guys or the main
person uh debunking the Russia collusion
hoax at Great personal risk
and
uh and that's something that I think
Trump will always be loyal to him
because Nunes was um just a great
Patriot fighting for the fighting for
that hoax to be
debunked so that's good
um what are you pointing
to okay so that's good anyway um
according to Jeff Charles writing in Red
State um so Hamas has agreed to some
concessions uh after Trump threatened
them with they'll be held to pay if they
don't let the hostages out now what
Hamas has offered is something like um
not all of the
hostages in return for IDF not having a
military pres right away presence right
away in in Gaza or something like that
so there was some thought that they were
getting flexible because they were
worried about
Trump I don't know
um I just have a problem with this being
a
negotiation I like the way Trump did it
Trump said if we don't have all the
hostages back they will be held to pay
if we back off from that and start
negotiating oh well okay yeah we'll take
half the hostages and and give you
something
I'm going to say it again
hostages is the price you pay to get
into a
negotiation they got to pay the whole
price that's that's just the entry for
us to talk to you because our first
choice is to kill every one of
you and that's the plan if you don't
like that plan you have a way to avoid
it give all the hostages back and then
maybe we can talk but I absolutely would
not negotiate for one of them because it
only makes it worse they're just going
to kidnap more people and try to
negotiate again if if it works you have
to break the cycle you got to break it
hard you have to break it so hard
they'll never forget so do I believe
that we should sacrifice the the
hostages I don't like to use that
word but if you want fewer hostages
being killed and tortured in the
future yes that that's what it means
when countries say we don't negotiate
with terrorists that's what this means
you don't do it because there'll be more
terrorism later so if you want to if you
want to show the most sympathy or
empathy for your
Republic probably not negotiating for
them as your best play but threatening
to to send them to hell and then going
through with it would be a really good
way to handle it so I think if Trump
were in charge more efficiently he could
sell his threat even
harder um but he's the only one who
could do
this you know it's still not easy you
can't predict he'll get it
done but nobody else could I'm pretty
sure nobody else could do
this um speaking of Iran and the
possibility of war with Iran when Trump
was asked he said qu anything can happen
that's about war with
Iran but he uh apparently said he wants
to take care of the problem of Iran and
not with a
war and uh he wants I guess his National
Security team Trump's incoming National
Security team they want to put maximum
pressure on on Iran without having to
attack but I can't see any Theory I
can't see any
way that Israel is going to allow Iran
to still have a nuclear program in few
months could we really talk Israel and
of taking out Iran's nuclear program if
they have the ability to do it and I'm
guessing they
do I think nothing's going to stop
Israel from taking out their nuclear Pro
program um so How Will trump play that
the only way that makes sense if is if
Trump could get almost immediately a
like a comprehensive deal that's like
for the whole Middle East you know just
like this massive peace deal but that
doesn't happen
fast and something fastish needs to
happen with their current situation so I
don't know if there's any way to to keep
Israel from taking out their what's left
of their nuclear
program so we'll
see well over on the all-in Pod uh they
had Keith raboy onto talking about uh
apple and
uh chath was saying uh quote my iPhone
does not work I'm sorry I'm just going
to say it
okay so he has the the iPhone 16 with
the most recent iOS update and then
Jason said you upgraded your software as
what happened you on iOS 18 it doesn't
work now that's a hell of a thing for
some of the most prominent technologist
investors
in America to say that the Apple iPhone
basically just doesn't
work that's pretty
brutal but they went
further um thinking that uh Apple is
really a design company More Than A
Product Company in other words it just
looks cool feels cool impresses your
friends that you have an iPhone Etc and
uh but they say their their product
strategy is still living in the jobs ivy
I era where taste and you know good
taste and stuff were driving
things
um but this brings me to my
complaint so it's time for me to upgrade
my
phone and sure enough the the battery
life just went to completely
unusable in other words if I don't
charge every every time I stop walking I
have to plug it in I it'll lose its
charge and it went from the most
reliably charged phone where I could go
for two days without a charge to it
feels like an
hour I'm probably exaggerating but it
feels like an hour if I'm using it at
all and and I don't think that's a
coincidence because they do have a
history of intentionally crippling an
old phone to get you to upgrade am I
right about that can you confirm that
give me a fact check it is a true fact
that apple in the
past intentionally with software
intentionally crippled your phone to
convince you to upgrade that's a fact
right I'm not I'm not hallucinating that
so when I see the exact same thing
happen to my phone that happened that
time because I also noticed as many of
you did when when they were accused of
doing it I noticed it
I mean it was really really
noticeable and it's really noticeable
right now so are they doing that
again or or did they find a clever way
to do it without doing it for
example would you say that they're
crippling your phone if all they did was
add a new software update that just
happens to use a lot of energy you know
unless you have the new phone is it
possible that they put out of sync the
software
upgrade with all of the old phones so
that yeah you can have the software
upgrade your phone might overheat if you
have one of those old ones but you know
on the new ones it works
great would that be
illegal it should
be is
it I doubt
it right I doubt it if if if iOS 18 is
way better but only on a new
phone is it illegal for them to make it
available to everybody knowing that it
will cause them to hate their old phone
and need to upgrade is it
illegal it's sort of maybe I don't
know now remember I'm not claiming this
as a fact so I want to make sure I don't
get sued I have no factual data to
support the hypothesis that they're
degrading my phone it's just a hell of a
coincidence it's a hell of a coincidence
it's what it feels like and I would
agree with the Allin pod opinions that
uh Apple's future doesn't look the same
as it used to now uh I remind you that I
I was a longtime Apple stock holder uh
until several months ago when I I
completely eliminated my position now
the reasoning was and I don't recommend
this by the way so if you if you sold
Apple when I did you lost a bunch of
money because it went up from when I
sold it it went up quite a bit from when
I sold it but here's a just an
investment advice it's a generic advice
so it's not about Apple I don't give
investment advice about specific
Investments
but um if you reason for buying a stock
changed that's when you should rethink
it I bought Apple stock because they had
a monopoly and it didn't look like
anybody would ever stop upgrading their
phones and you know they built a a
network of products that work together
it was impossible to leave it was like
you're trapped
there and so that was a good long-term
play and it was just like they printed
money for a while but it was my
observation that their innovation seems
to have stalled and that the you know
competitors presumably will make better
and better phones maybe somebody like
Elon Musk will someday introduce a phone
and he's already got his Network so it
seemed to me that they were no longer an
obvious
impenetrable Monopoly and that was the
only reason I had my money there I
wouldn't put my money in an individual
company at least not any sizable money
unless it just looks so strong that
nobody could Ki them out for example
Amazon now I'm not recommending Amazon I
don't own any of the Amazon stock at the
moment but it doesn't look like
anything's going to replace
it so if that's the reason you in you
invested because you know nobody can
touch
them maybe that's different now so
rethink that with apple but don't take
my advice on any
Investments um according to Gilmore
Health news scientists have a way to
maybe suppress traumatic memories and
enhance positive
ones so some kind of medical
intervention to do that to suppress
traumatic memories and enhance positive
ones
um there is already a way to do that I
hate to tell you I don't recommend this
because I'm not your doctor but that is
what weed
does now again weed's not good for
everybody if you're under 18 don't touch
it actually if you're under 25 it's
probably a bad idea uh if you have a job
that requires you to be not high don't
recommend it don't recommend it so
there's tons of reasons not to and my in
my low battery I just got a low battery
notice on my phone
ironically but it is my experience as a
lived experience that you can make most
traumatic memories uh soften
pretty
quickly um I don't know if it's going to
make you remember the good ones more
than more than you did but you can
definitely make the bad
memories go from DEFCON 5 to defon 2 in
about five minutes
so there's
that and then according to Stanford
University there's a new device that
somehow it can make fertilizer out of
the air
they found a way to make fertilizer out
of air so apparently they can somehow
pull um ammonia out of the air and
ammonia is one of the big fertilizer
components
components um so sure enough they can
pull fertilizer out of the air now at
least a component of it that's kind of
cool and that ladies and
gentlemen is all I needed to talk about
today we'll keep an eye on those drones
whether you like it or or not you can
replace your battery on an
iPhone we'll see I've got a feeling it's
not the battery but we'll see all right
ladies and gentlemen I'm going to go
talk to the local subscribers
privately you think there's a Tesla
phone coming I know it's a
possibility all right everybody on X and
Rumble
and uh rumble on YouTube I'll see you
tomorrow same time same place thanks for
