i'll even put on my microphone for you
youtube people
yeah that's the kind of guy i am
well good morning and welcome to
the place where i can't put my elbow on
the desk because i'm
too spazzed to even do that this morning
but let me tell you your day
is looking up
i don't know how it started
but pay attention to how it gets better
starting now
right you can already feel it can't you
a little bit of a lift to your day just
the moment you heard my voice
yeah because you've been trained that
this
is a highlight of your day the
simultaneous sip is the best thing
that's ever happened
all morning so far
and all you need to participate
is a copper mug or a glass of tanger
chelsea stein the canteen jugger flask
vessel
of what kind any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including kim's birthday happy birthday
kim
everybody it's kim's birthday over on on
youtube um everybody for this is for kim
simultaneous sip birthday edition happy
birthday kim
now
i don't want to go out on a limb and say
that kim who we just met here on her
comment on youtube
um might be the best birthday you're
ever gonna have
yep
so next year a little bit of a
disappointment but this year
wow
wow
and you you kicked that off just right
well
so
boo the cat update
my loving cat boo should be coming home
today
she'll still have a little feeding tube
that apparently i'm gonna have to
stick her meds and her liquid food into
her feeding tube for a few more days
but she's apparently doing well
uh i guess they give the feeding tube
and the side of the neck
so it's not like it's up to
it's not in the cat's mouth or in its
nose
and i guess they put them to sleep and
stick a little thing in their neck and
then you can just shove food didn't
medicine down it until they feel better
and then
take it out
so amazing technology but i guess it
works well we found out today that uh
you know those uh
those nasal tests
that you get
and they they take out the q-tip that's
you know
the the size of a baseball bat
and they shove it up your nose
until it hits your brain
and you feel it like you know as you're
getting tested you're like
oh i think i'm forgetting my second
grade experience ah
i don't remember my friend bob from ah
yeah it's basically giving you brain
damage as you're getting no it's not no
it's not i shouldn't even say that
somebody's gonna believe it's true no it
doesn't give you brain damage but it
turns out
that you can get the same results
from gargling
so apparently the other model that they
could have done
is
take a swig or something and spit it
into a cup
so for a year and a half
we've had sticks shoved up our nose
to tickle our brains
didn't eat it
i didn't eat it
just spit in a cup i would have done it
too
so thanks to adam dopamine on twitter
for alerting me to that update
so i saw a fascinating uh thread on
twitter that i will call to your
attention just look at my twitter feed
to see it i just put it there today
this morning so you'll find it and it's
about africa
and alcohol
and it's a story that i had never heard
now there's a little pushback on on
twitter
from um
people who no i'm i have not read norms
by autobiography you can stop asking
uh so there's a little pushback about
whether this is accurate or maybe it's
just
uh
anti-european
racism reverse racism kind of thing
so i will uh
i will say that i can't vouch for the
historical accuracy of it
it's presented by somebody who seems to
know what they're doing
but the idea was this that apparently
the
uh a lot of the colonists and i don't
know how universal or
essentially planned any of this was i
don't think it was centrally planned
but they would use alcohol
to
colonize parts of africa
and they would they would do it a couple
different ways
one is that they would get the locals
addicted
they would just addict them to alcohol
and then
when you're trading your alcohol for
their whatever they have
you're going to get a good deal
because they kind of have to give it to
you because they're addicted so they
actually turn to the locals into
alcoholics
but the second thing they did is
since the locals did not have a culture
and history of alcohol
they would typically drink too much
because you know
what just wasn't part of their
history and you know the knowledge of
how to handle it right
and they would you know get a little
wild as people do on alcohol
and then the colonists would use that
reportedly
as their excuse to take over
because they'd say well look at these
savages running around all drunk
they can't run themselves they need a
little help
so part of the scheme for taking off
over these places
involved alcohol
apparently the first factory in
in africa it was a distillery
now the pushback
is maybe it wasn't some universal
centrally planned you know
white thing to get rid of black people
or something it was probably just a
bunch of people who realized it worked
and so they did it but you don't realize
the pernicious effect of alcohol in the
whole history of humankind
it's a way bigger deal that i think we
appreciate
how much alcohol and even you know
uh
poppies and stuff have changed
civilization
and so this conversation caused at least
one person to find a study
that suggests that moderate drinking of
alcohol is good for you
do you believe that how many people hear
in the comments
you've all seen the studies
and they've been repeated number of
studies said the same thing how many of
you believe
that moderate drinking is good for you
actually it's actually not just neutral
it's actually good for you how many of
you believe it
because the studies say that right
how many of you have seen those studies
that say
a little bit of alcohol is good for you
in moderation yeah why right
do you believe it
who did those studies
yeah you're going to get really quiet
here in a moment
who do you think did those studies
what do you think funded them
just a guess
what's your best guess
about who funded the studies that says
alcohol is good for you
yeah just take a guess
now
are you aware let me just give you some
context first are you aware that um
there was a time in our history
in which the advertisement said
cigarettes were good for you
are you aware of that just as context
there was a time in our history where we
were told that cigarettes
were healthy they're good for you
who do you think uh funded those studies
or if
even if there were studies i don't even
know if there were
well probably the cigarette companies
right
if you see a study that says alcohol is
good for you
somebody directly or indirectly probably
with the alcohol industry had something
to do with it
now
let me ask you this
do the studies that say alcohol seems to
be associated with better health
do they show the causation
in the comments
do you believe that there's any science
that demonstrates causation
not just correlation because the
correlation i think is pretty well
established
moderate drinkers do are healthier i i
think that might actually be true
but do you believe that science in any
study has established that it's a cause
nope
even uh i i see somebody refer to
resvetrol or whatever it is the
chemistry that's in wine yes
that has been shown to have a healthy
benefit that one chemical but there's so
little of it in the amount that you
drink that it wouldn't have any effect
even the science doesn't claim that
drinking would give you that effect
extreme moderation is good
um
oh um
alien baby says uh i funded a study
proving that giving to your
husband extends your life your wife's
life and the husbands
i feel like that's science
i'm a little skeptical about this
alcohol stuff but this study
now that's something i can
i can believe
so
here's my prediction are you ready
contrary prediction
someday
you will learn
that alcohol in moderation is not good
for you
and then it never was
and there was always here's the
reason that it should you should expect
studies would show a strong correlation
between moderate drinking
and
healthiness because the people who are
capable of moderate drinking
are all healthier
and they're the ones who have friends
they socialize
that's what the moderate drinking is
socializing with their friends these
things are all correlated with good
health
so yes of course it's correlated
but there's no evidence of causation and
the you know and i don't even think
there's any reason to believe there
would be
so someday you will see that this uh
prediction will come true that that was
always always
that alcohol is poison and it's just
poison and it's not good for you at any
amount it's fun
i didn't say it wasn't
fun it's just not good for you
health-wise
um
question i got from many people is okay
scott so you cleverly think that the
simulation
is really describing reality in that and
that the math of it and the statistics
are
that uh we're probably a simulation not
an original species
now
does that eliminate the possibility of
god it does not because you could have a
god who created the first species and
then the first species created all the
rest of these simulations of which we
are more likely to be a simulation than
an original because there will always be
more simulations than originals
right
but somebody asked me well somebody had
to get it all going right there had to
be something first
right
so there had to be something before the
simulation
right
nope
you want to have your brain explode
nope
it is not logical that there had to be
something first
because time space time let's say space
time to make it sound a little more
sciencey
but the time version of that
is incident
it's infinite
how can you have something start
when time is infinite
there can't be there logically there
can't be a beginning because there would
have been something before that
so
i don't think that it's logical that
something had to get it all going
because it's not logical to think it
ever started
there probably was no start
right
if time is infinite it also didn't have
a beginning
so you don't need a god
to get things going because things were
always going
now you're saying to yourself
i don't know if that makes any sense at
all
right
does it does does it sort of not kind of
make sense
that things could just always be here
right that's the point
your human brain
doesn't have a chance of understanding
infinity
not a chance your brain doesn't have
that capability it's like your brain
can't mow the lawn it's just a brain you
know unless it tells your body to get a
lawnmower
but
your brain doesn't have the capability
to understand infinity and stuff like
that
so when you say well logically there had
to be a start nope
nope
logically the most likely explanation is
that there's something that happens or
happened or happening
that you don't understand
that's it
just something you don't understand
because your brain isn't built to do
that but no it does not make sense that
there had to be a beginning
might have been
doesn't have to be
all right
um
biden is continuing to blame trump for
some of his
you know bad first-year performance
and
i feel like that was a pretty good play
at one point
right when biden first took over
pretty good play to blame the
previous president
how long can you play that play
like how many months can you get away we
say well it's really just what was left
by the last guy
i'd say that time has passed
right
somebody says two years i don't know
i feel our attention span has just
shrunk too much and then at this point
you know six months is a really long
time in our lives
but
i have a feeling that biden blaming
trump for any of the stuff like that the
haitian
haitians under a branch
that wouldn't have happened with job
right
um it feels like there's just a whole
bunch of problems that are specifically
biden related you know the afghan
afghanistan pull out could have been a
lot better etc
how in the world do you blame trump for
that stuff
but he's doing it
and i feel as if it sounds a little bit
ridiculous at this point
doesn't it
because it feels like it's just a
defense by memory or something
like biden is just saying oh yeah last
time i said it was the previous guy so
i'll just keep saying that
it doesn't work forever
and i i would argue that it stopped
working already i feel like it just
makes him look bad at this point
in the beginning it was a reasonable
claim but at this point
too many months have gone by it just
looks bad
well as the uh as predicted the arizona
audit has produced two entirely
different narratives one nothing was
found two plenty of stuff was found
they can't both be true
either the arizona
audit
didn't find enough to matter
or
if found so much
that you have to throw out the whole
election
and both of those stories are in the
news today
just one is left associated one is right
associated
so what do you make of that
was there any point in having an audit
if we're just gonna decide yeah i did
call it and by the way wasn't that the
easiest prediction in the world
was there anybody who thought the audit
would give a result that everybody would
agree with
did you really think that we don't live
in that world anymore
here comes the spin
it was spin
you know uh i i guess i'm always
insulted when
people uh
you know blame me of blame you for
spinning
because what is spinning other than a
point of view
what's the difference between spinning
and having a point of view
is there a difference no it's just a
 word that you use because you're
an ignorant troll
and you add nothing to the world
also spin we'll see your spin
thanks for nothing
let's see your opinion
we'll all call it spin
well both politico and slate
ran
feature articles about me
specifically my association with this
weird matt gates story and my part of
the my part of the story is is trivial
but because i guess i'm the dilbert guy
it became a major article
but here's the part that i was involved
in somebody i know from you know
twitter
associations primarily
uh sent me a scoop
on the matt gaysling
jake novak
and
um
and then that got into the news blah
blah
so
but the part of what makes people
curious is why
why anybody would have told me that
scoop
does that make you curious
are you curious as to why
somebody would give me that scoop before
i hit the news
what do you think
does that
does that seem unusual
so
uh one of you says you're bi-curious
okay
i'll accept that i'll accept by curious
in the context of this conversation
um
yeah there's there wasn't anything
there wasn't anything even slightly
unusual about that the most common thing
that happens for those of us doing this
political commenting
is that other people who do political
commenting
tell us scoops before you hear it
how many times have i told you that i
hear stuff before you hear it
it doesn't all come from jake novak
it comes from everybody
the most common thing that you know we
newsy
talking people do is share scoops before
you see them in the news it's like one
of the most common things but when you
see just one of them
you know plucked out of the out of that
context you're like hey what's going on
here
maybe we need to dig deeper no
no
it's just the most normal thing that
happens to people in our
you know in our circle
sharing sharing scoops
um
so anyway that's that's all there is to
that
still no bite in apology
for uh throwing his own border patrol
under a brass under under brush under a
bus under a bus
uh you know the story the allegedly
there was a border
patrol person on a horse who allegedly
used a whip
on a haitian immigrant but in fact it
was the reins he used to his horse and
he wasn't whipping anybody except he was
using the reins the way they're meant to
be used on a horse
and
now that everybody knows it's a fake
news
i don't think there's any anybody on the
democrat side who still thinks it's true
right
is it i think it's so thoroughly
debunked by the photographer who took
the picture
and 100 percent of the people were there
there's no person who was there
in a person who says it happened
so we know it didn't happen
where is biden's apology
you know
as the creator of the dilbert comic
strip
let me tell you the main theme for all
these years in the dilbert comic strip
there's one theme that you see over and
over and over again in dilbert and that
is that the boss
has the power to create the problem
and then assign the blame to an employee
is the biggest problem in work
that the boss causes the problem
and then assigns it to you
oh that was i guess you failed no i
didn't fail you made it impossible
by because of what you did
right
the most common problem and biden is
doing that
biden created the problem by imagining
it
literally imagining it
and then he
says this guy's going to be punished
probably ruins this border patrol guy's
life because people are going to believe
that he whipped black people
great try living with that
um didn't happen
so
um i did a robust read news comic but it
made me think of the best strategy for
the
uh border patrol agent
here is what the border patrol agent
should do you ready for this this is
real advice
right it's going to sound like a joke
and it is a joke
but it's also real advice
it goes like this
that border agent working with a lawyer
from perhaps should issue a press
release
the press release should say
that he takes a full responsibility
for using an imaginary whip
on an immigrant
takes full responsibility
for using an imaginary whip use those
words
yes i was the man who used the imaginary
whip
and then
once you've uh once you've taken full
responsibility for it
offer in the interest of freedom in the
interest of fairness
offered to have a haitian immigrant
whip him in return
with the same whip
it has to be the same whip the imaginary
one
and so
actually stage put it on video
this guy tied to a tree
you know tying himself to a tree and
have have a haitian get an actual
haitian
i'm sure you could find an actual
haitian to do it right if you pay him
get an actual haitian
to stand there with nothing in his hand
and pretend to whip him on video
and just say i hope that this makes
everything even
i take full responsibility for my
imaginary whip whipping
and i now have been imaginary whipped in
return
and i think we're all fair now now we're
all good now right
now it sounds like a joke
it's not
i would actually literally do that
because this poor border patrol agent
just got by the president of the
united states
let me say it again because swear words
are necessary for this story
this border patrol agent trying to do
his job
trying to keep the united states safe
just got by the
commander-in-chief
and the commander-in-chief
knows it by now
and he isn't apologizing
and so this border patrol agent i hope
takes the opportunity he has
to
joe biden back
make him a laughing stock
make him a joke
unless he apologizes yeah an apology i
think
should be accepted in this case because
it is an honest mistake
i don't think that biden meant to
misunderstand the situation
it was an honest mistake if he gives him
an apology i think he should accept it
but if he doesn't
apologize
this border patrol agent should take the
opportunity he's been given to just
biden badly
just embarrass the out of him in
public
because he can it's right there for the
taking all he has to do is stage an
event
no he probably doesn't want the you know
of course the border agent probably
doesn't want to be famous for this
so maybe maybe that's a bad idea
maybe it's better just lay low
all right
as joel pollock noted in a tweet the
wall street journal has an article about
it turns out that while biden is saying
that china is an adversary blah blah
blah make things in america
that his uh was it the secretary of
commerce
is
yeah the commerce chief is trying to
make more business with china
so biden's commerce chief believes that
the united states is best off
by increasing the amount of business we
do with china increasing it
oh
my god
matt gates just tweeted at me
um somebody says in the comments
i'll take a look at that in a minute um
let's see yeah so what are we supposed
to make of the fact that biden says yeah
we're gonna you know make stuff in
america blah blah but his commerce chief
seems to be doing the opposite
well let's let's agree that our
government is probably corrupt
in terms of china
and
certainly incompetent
we're watching it right in front of us
this this is just
ranking competence and so in those
situations the public has to take
take charge
now there are very few things that i'm
perfectly suited for
for example if you said scott can you
sit in with this band
and play drums because i know you're
you're learning the drums and i would
say you know i'm really bad at that you
really don't want me to try that
if you said to me scott um
i'd like you to let's say a place center
for our basketball team
i'd say to you hmm not your best choice
of personnel
i might not be your first choice to play
center in the basketball
but
if you need somebody to embarrass the
living
out of some american corporation that
would dare
to start new business in china now
call me
call me
all right
pick somebody else to be your
center on your basketball team
pick somebody else to be the general
contractor on your house
pick somebody else to be your lawyer and
your doctor
i can't do that stuff
but if there's an american company that
wants to do new business in china i'm
not talking about the ones that are
already there they've got a different
set of problems
but a new company
just let me know
let me know
i will take care of that for you
i will personally
make sure that that's a bad idea for
whatever company announces it wants to
do business in china
so let me do that
let me do that for you
i will handle this for you
all right it's a promise
are you following the theranos is it if
i'm pronouncing right theranos case
this was the founder who basically was
just a fraudulent company and they said
they were going to do these cheap blood
tests that would find all kinds of
things easily
um
and
apparently it was all fraud but here's
the so that there's a legal case going
on now about that but here's what is
interesting
james mattis
invested 85 000 in this company was on
the board
james mad dog mattis
now correct me if i'm wrong
correct me if i'm wrong
but uh didn't trump fire james mattis
for being stupid
that happened right i mean that's wasn't
that
give me a give me a fact check on here
wasn't
didn't trump say out loud
that mattis was dumb
he did right
so mattis the guy that we trusted
to make our most important military
decisions
invested
in the biggest fraudulent company
of i don't know
last 20 years
i don't think i have a lot of confidence
in his generaling
he feels like the kind of guy who might
be
duped into a trap kind of easily
you think now to be fair rupert murdoch
also was one of the largest investors
so you say well if rupert murdoch got
fooled you know
he's a more experienced investor
you you shouldn't be too surprised if
somebody was a general and not really an
investor shouldn't be too surprised if
if a general gets fooled if a big
investor like rupert murdoch could get
fooled
do you think rupert murdoch kicked the
tires of this company himself
do you think rupert murdoch you know
visited
met with the founder and did a deep dive
into the financials
no
no
oh i'm pretty sure that rupert murdoch
has people who do startup investments
for him
probably mentioned the name at a meeting
hey we're putting a little money into
this one or that one or that one
probably heard the name
might have maybe
maybe knew what the company did for a
living
but i don't think you can compare what
murdoch did for a small investment like
that apparently also david boyes the
attorney you hear in a lot of stories
also invested
so i love seeing stories of smart people
investing in fraudulent companies
now
have i ever invested in a fraudulent
company
have i ever have i ever put
[Music]
uh
have i ever put way more than 85 000
into a company that turned out to be a
total fraud
yeah
yeah i've done that
do you remember a web van
there was a company that was going to
deliver groceries to your house
and the uh
the
the managers were saying that the model
was proven and you know it was already
worked in one area and they were things
were going great
at the same time they were they're
planning to close the company
so i i got taken on that one
but it's fun to make fun of uh
other people who get taken but to be
honest
it could happen to any of us
there's an article in cnn that i find
amusing
it says that voter suppression doesn't
work basically because it suppresses
white votes so if what you wanted to do
was to suppress black votes
you accidentally
in the process of attempting to suppress
the black vote you end up actually
depressing the white vote
two different ways
number one i don't know why nobody ever
brought this up before
you all know that there are more poor
white people than black people right
now as a percentage
there are more poor black people than
poor white people but in terms of
absolute numbers
am i wrong that there are way more poor
white people
and why is it that the poor white people
we imagine can go out and get an id no
problem
but the poor black people can't
uh how racist are you
to imagine that
a poor person of one color can just go
out and get an id and the poor person of
another color can't do it can't figure
it out
well i'm here to tell you that that
probably has more to do with being poor
and where you live
than what color you are right i don't
think there's any indication that your
color
determines whether you can get an id
anybody claim that anybody no it's your
it's your
socioeconomic situation
that determines whether it'll be hard
for you to get an id right everybody
agrees with that right
so logically won't there be way more
white people who can't vote if you do
anything to reduce the amount of voting
shouldn't you have fewer white votes
than black
now as a percentage
as a percentage
maybe more black
but we don't elections are not based on
percentages based on how many votes you
get
well i mean ultimately it's a percentage
against the competitor but you need to
get the most votes
so wouldn't it be better to get every
white vote you could
even if it cost you a few black votes
you could have suppressed if you tried
so weirdly
cnn is taking both sides of the issue
they're saying
don't do any voter suppression
because it'll be bad for black people
and by the way
it's not bad for black people nearly as
much as it's bad for white people
you gotta have it both ways right
if cnn is reporting at least reporting
in the sense of an opinion piece in this
case
the voter suppression doesn't work and
it just makes republicans worse off
i i guess the other part of it is that
if you talk about the system being
broken
it it also causes
less republican voting i don't i'm not
sure i believe that but people are
saying that
so
i guess i'm confused
about whether voter suppression is good
or bad for black people
and it looks like cnn's not quite on you
know one page about it it's either
terrible for black people or it helps
them
it helps them because fewer white people
vote which means that the percentage of
black people would be relatively better
no way am i doing the math right but it
does seem to to me that uh
we don't even know if it's good or bad
for any particular group
and yeah we're talking about like crazy
well the taliban is bringing back uh
public hangs and
they're going to do amputations again
so if you steal something they'll cut
off your hand
they're still not deciding whether
they'll do the amputations in public
because
because the taliban are not the old
taliban you know the old ones they were
really cruel they would do your
amputations right in public but i think
they're going to maybe considering doing
them not in public so
oh yeah they're still doing the hangings
in public they just did a bunch of
hangings they killed some
kidnappers
and hung them from cranes in various
cities as a lesson yeah they're still
going to hang people in public i mean
they're still the taliban
let me give you some advice that will
serve you better in your life than
anything you've ever heard in your whole
whole life
it goes like this
never trust
what people say
taliban said hey we're not the old
taliban we're the new taliban
we're not going to do these horrible
horrible things
yeah we're kinder we're gentler
never trust
what anybody says
not just the taliban
now here's the part that you know you
probably said to yourself uh scott i
wasn't trusting the taliban you're not
adding anything
no i'm saying don't trust the taliban
don't trust their word anyway but also
don't trust
somebody else you know at work
and don't trust
your best friend or your spouse
don't trust any of your friends or any
of your family
did i leave anybody out don't trust
the word of any humans
humans
don't trust any of their words all right
that's the first part of the advice
there's a second part
that will redeem me
now you say to yourself scott i can't
really live in a world where i don't
trust anybody
because i'm required to trust people
no
don't trust what people say here's what
you can trust
here's the payoff here's the reason you
watch me on livestream
this will change your life
this little reframe
pay attention carefully
never trust what anybody says
always trust
that people will be the same as they
have been
it's different
never trust what anybody says friends or
enemies
friends or enemies don't trust them
you only trust
that they are the same people that they
were yesterday that's it
that's it
if
let me take an example if i were to ask
um either of my siblings
to do something like you know i don't
hold some money or something and and i
would have to completely trust them
because i wouldn't know if they stole
any
i wouldn't care what they said about it
i wouldn't even wouldn't matter
what i would trust
is that my siblings are the same people
they've always been
which means they're not going to steal
my money
because they never have
never will right they're the same people
the taliban
said they're going to do something
different than what they used to do
but it's still the taliban
now it's a little different because
maybe the members of the taliban have
changed a little bit but i feel like the
principle still stands
it's still the taliban
right at least in the short run it's
still the taliban
so
watch how many times this rule
works
you can absolutely trust somebody to be
the same way they used to be
if they were a liar yesterday
they're a liar tomorrow
if they were honest yesterday and always
were
tomorrow's looking good too ignore what
they say
you're only the only thing you can know
with any kind of uncertainty is that
it's the same person it was yesterday
that's it
don't trust anything else
now watch how often this works for you
the first time you hear it you're
thinking to yourself
let me see if i can guess what you're
thinking i don't know if that's such a
difference
right you're thinking i don't know i see
what you're saying but it feels like the
same thing trust the person trust what
they say it's not
it's not and when you start you start
making that distinction
life gets a lot cleaner
and suddenly all your surprises go away
suddenly no surprises
never be surprised again
all right um that
is what i wanted to talk about i heard
somebody say that matt gates tweeted at
me we'll see if that's
true or what that's about
so you can watch this in real time
let's see
where would that be
tweets let's look up
matt we'll go to matt gates's page
they'll find it easier
all right
um
oh it's
okay it's not
all right so matt gates is just dunking
on uh jake novak
for a tweet that jake made
and he just he just uh mentions me as
being part of that story so it wasn't so
much
at me i was just included
um
all right
so yeah i've told you before i i try to
mind my own business and then i end up
being in the middle of stories
someday
someday
i'll tell you what stories i've actually
been involved in
i might have to wait for some people to
die
before i can do that
but
there are a lot of stories that you have
no idea
i had some involvement in and mostly i
can't tell you about them
but someday
you know when enough time goes by i'll
be able to tell those stories
and uh
it's going to be mind-boggling you won't
believe any of it
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
