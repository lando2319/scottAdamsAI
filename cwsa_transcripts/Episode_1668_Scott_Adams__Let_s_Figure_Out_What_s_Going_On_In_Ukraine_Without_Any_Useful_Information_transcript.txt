ah
good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization it's called coffee with
scott adams gets better every time
can you confirm that yes you can
it's the power of the crowd they've
already convinced you
now some say
it's just a placebo
some people say that coffee with scott
adams makes you
think you're happier
but what if you're not
and i say those people are idiots
because if you think you're happy you're
happy damn it and i don't care what joe
biden tells you
so let's take it up a notch because we
can
all you need is a cover of my girl glass
a tanker chelsea stein a canteen jugger
flask of asylum eye and fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day it's
the thing that makes everything better
except the war in ukraine and
laurie laurie possabic that's a funny
last name in the sense of
funny that it sounds familiar
sounds like a family member
to jack but i digress
join me now sip
encircled and being shelled yeah
all right let's talk about all the
things that are happening
number one
so yesterday i retweeted a alexander
vindeman tweet
which some say included fake news
the fake news being that there was a
general in charge of the ukraine
situation
who was fired by putin for presumably
doing a bad job
but
as other people said wait a minute
alexander vinman maybe the reports of
this general being fired are fake
because he appeared with putin
at some announcement after he supposedly
had been fired
so
what do you say
the general was reported to be fired
but then very soon after appeared with
putin in what seemed to be an official
capacity
so is it fake news
or is it a reverse fake news meaning
that
if if putin had actually fired his main
general
do you think he would not invite him to
the meeting on the camera
of course he would
number one
the guy you just fired from the head of
the situation
also knows the most
even if you just fired him
you'd keep him on the team he'd still go
to the meeting
and if you didn't want the world to know
you had just fired your general
you would still invite him to the
meeting
so i'm going to say that the people who
debunked
vinman's tweet
may be the ones who are debunked
themselves because their debunk is not
convincing
and vinman only said it was a report
he did not state it was true he said it
was reported so the tweet was that it
was reported and that's true and then
the debunk is i would say
marginally
persuasive
marginally
i get that being filmed in public
after he should have been fired
does make you wonder
if it was true or not
but it doesn't tell you anything for
sure
so i'm going to say that's a question
mark but i'm guessing that story because
it sort of went away
we'd probably have some more
confirmation if it were true by now
i think
on the other hand i also can't imagine
that putin wouldn't be firing a general
by now
am i right
doesn't it seem to you that some general
would be fired by now
or
you know demoted or something
all right
um i guess uh ukraine and russia are
going to talk in belarus
do you think this is real
do you think that uh
do you think that uh
russia actually wants to talk about
peace
or is it just part of the public
relations
because we do think that
putin might need an exit
ramp
unless he's actually winning
do you believe anything that's coming
out of ukraine because you probably
shouldn't
do you believe that the russian army is
basically thwarted
or do you believe that they're just
uncoiling and they've got the city
surrounded and they can kind of take
their time and do what they want
because nothing
nothing would stop them
well we don't really know do we
and here's my question
is ukraine already
not have cell service
anywhere
is the entire
ukrainian mobile
phone network already down
can somebody tell me that that feels
like that should be in the news all the
time if it is do they have access to the
internet
they can still upload videos so
if you've got a population center that's
full of people with smartphones
and the population centers are being
attacked
why are we not really seeing much in the
way of video
should we not be seeing almost unlimited
video like like people cowering down but
sticking up their phone to
to record things
so somebody says we are but i'm not
like what what news source are you
watching
check reddit somebody says well i also
worry that things that are labeled to be
from there are fake
you'll see a lot today
i don't know
but don't you have a question about that
it just does seem like
first of all why are the why are the
phone networks working and if they are
it doesn't make sense we're not seeing a
lot more video because even the the
sources that i look at would still have
those videos
yeah
so i guess that's a big question
here's a question i asked apparently
this was a plot for the tv show silicon
valley but i didn't know that
is there a way to make it an emergency
is there a way to make your your mobile
phones
um a mesh network of some sort
so that as long as you were close enough
to somebody else who had a phone
your signal could hop to their phone
before it finds another way out
is that a thing
doesn't well it doesn't have the
software of course
but could it
that the mesh needs to be in every app
yes the camera's pointed in the right
direction
uh stuxnet
i think they do that on cruises they
don't think they do do they
tethering
all right so i guess we don't know that
but
uh a company called gotenna does that
somebody says
mesh tastic
all right so i guess the open question
is is there a way that
despots could
be thwarted from turning off networks
because the phones just turn into a mesh
network on their own it feels like we
should be working on that for disaster
right
see elon musk tweet well i know about
starlink but you need a certain kind of
terminal for that
that's not going to help you if you
don't have the right equipment
to use their network
we already have mesh tastic and low raw
devices
yes you can use your phone with those
through bt
okay
interesting
so maybe there's something there
question do you think that uh the
experience in ukraine so far
is making uh china more or less
confident that they could take taiwan
i i feel like
i feel like china is watching this and
saying uh oh
you can't really move massive equipment
into any place that has drones
or any place as modern technology
right
because the whole the whole uh process
of occupation
requires lots of heavy equipment
weapons and troop carriers and tanks
and i don't think there's any world
anymore
in which those that kind of equipment
can make it into the country unmolested
i mean i think it would just be
turned to burning embers somewhere on
the highway toward the metro centers
so we'll talk about that a little bit
more
do you remember when the military said
that the biggest threat to the u.s
military was climate change
and a lot of people snorted and said
come on
you're being a little politically
correct there that can't be the biggest
military threat
and then we find ourselves
looking at uh putin putting his nuclear
forces on alert
because of ukraine
which is largely because or at least
partly because
the way we manage energy in the united
states
which is partly because of climate
change
narrative
so indeed
not maybe not in the way that
was imagined but climate change actually
literally became our biggest military
problem because the way it works through
the system and makes you know russia
richer and that emboldens them
so i didn't see that coming
are you seeing any reports that russia
is is holding a major city in ukraine
because the the standard news is saying
no right
but i'm also seeing russian trolls on
twitter saying saying that you know
some city fell
now
is anybody else getting a lot of russian
troll action
because i am i'm getting obvious russian
operatives who are tweeting at me i mean
they're just really obvious
now is that is everybody getting that or
are they targeting people who just do
some kind of public commenting
uh why assume they are trolls because
they have completely different
information and it's uh
it's obvious disinformation
i'm not even going to tell you what
they're saying because it's
pretty obviously disinformation
yeah i think i might be a target but
it could be just a general approach who
knows
um
i remind you again that i might be the
only person who said prior to the
invasion that if there was an invasion
which by the way i predicted incorrectly
because i said there's no way russia
i said there's no way putin thinks this
could pay off
right
uh
and uh so i got that wrong but i was
making an assumption that he was
operating rationally
and
who knows you know the the information
at the moment is that he's not
but you can't rely on that either
oh you are a bad person there
let's get rid of the bad person who's
putting the bad words here
remove
sorry about that sorry you had to put up
with that
um
now
there's a big mystery going on
which is why is ukraine doing so well
or are they i i guess the first question
is
do we even know for sure that the
ukrainian resistance is putting up a
great fight
because i don't know that we know that
for sure
right
yeah i don't know that we know that for
sure
yeah you know we're also now seeing
pictures of dead russians
is that true
well
i saw mike cervich asking about this
yesterday it was a good question
apparently there are people who know
more than i do who say it looks like the
russians are sending their
their low-end tanks they're not sending
their best equipment
does that make sense that they wouldn't
send their best
yes my allergies are back
and i'm not sure even that's true
now could it be
i was seeing a lot of speculation about
why we're seeing what we're seeing if
it's even true
one is that maybe they're just
you know testing the defense so they
send in their bad tanks to see what
happens and they figure they'll lose a
bunch
it might be that they're putting all the
good equipment in one place so maybe the
best equipment
is already staged for let's say taking
the capital or something so it could be
that the you know what you're seeing is
the bad equipment being destroyed but
that's a diversion from the good stuff
which is waiting to attack somewhere
else i suppose that's possible
the other possibility is they don't have
any good stuff
that they do have high-end tanks and
whatnot
but not many of them and maybe they just
didn't want to risk them
maybe they thought it would be such an
easy war
or that ukraine would just defold
immediately that they didn't need to
risk any of the good stuff
maybe they didn't want the americans or
nato
to see how their best equipment operates
and they thought well we don't need the
best stuff
so those are all possibilities right
let me give you my
filter on this
which i i don't know if anybody else has
said this
yet
but i'm going to put the dilbert filter
on this
now the dilbert filter is how do how
does any large organization operate
whether it's a government
could even be within a dictatorship
or
you know a regular corporation there are
some things that are very common to
large organizations
and one of them is the slow walk
the slow walk is when the boss tells you
to do something that you don't think
should be done but you don't want to
argue with the boss for all the obvious
reasons
so you say sure boss
and then you go about the job of doing
it but inefficiently in other words you
you might put in a phone call
but then you don't do anything until you
get a return call which often never
comes
and then when somebody asks you to say
yeah i got it i put in a call i just
haven't gotten the call back
now if you were really trying to get
something done
you'd put in a call you put in a text
you'd go visit the person you'd bug them
until you got a response you try
somebody else
you know that's what it looks like when
you're trying to get something done
but when you're slow walking
you do what you're told to do
and you just make it look like
you're you're following orders
to me it looks a lot like the generals
are slow walking this because
they don't want to win
and one reason that they might not want
to win is that they think putin has lost
it
and if they lose the war
then they could have a justification for
taking putin out a palace coup as it
were
at the moment correct me if i'm wrong
putin is still wildly popular in russia
and taking ukraine i think taking crimea
brought him to like 80 popularity didn't
it at least for a while
who knows if those numbers are accurate
but
there's no way that the anybody could
take putin out unless they degrade his
um
let's say his
his reputation
are the generals slow walking the war
because they have no reason to win
there's nothing in it for him
and their best play if they think if
they think putin has lost it and he's
actually just dangerous at this point
they might try to slow walk the war
and not try to win
there's huge corruption in the russian
army i don't know if that plays a part
in it
um
maybe he thought it would be like taking
crimea yeah
now let's talk about
why it's not
have you all seen some drone footage of
what looks like ukrainian
ukrainian operated drones i think
they're turkish by design
and
i asked how many they have and how many
would it take to stop
a russian incursion
well the big variable here
is the russian anti-aircraft
defenses
so presumably here so i'm not a military
person so so correct me in real time as
i go right i'm just saying some things
that sound logical but they may not be
militarily sound
that i would think that the only defense
the invading army would have
would be ground-based anti-aircraft so
if
if a serious military drone came into
the airspace they would try to shoot it
down with the anti-aircraft am i right
if the drone or some other
some other kind of weapons
took out their ground-based
anti-aircraft
which would be easy to identify
because apparently they just come in on
a big highway during the daytime
if you're looking down from above with
satellites or anything else drones or
satellites or who knows
can't you just see them
and you know you're also talking about
jamming equipment couldn't we just see
the jamming equipment
and then could we take that out first
so here's the real question could we
take out their jamming and anti-aircraft
so soon
that they would come into the country
naked
in other words it's the only thing you
target as soon as the convoy comes
across the bridge you take out their
anti-aircraft and then here's the genius
part
you let them in
but you let them in naked
because they wouldn't have anti-aircraft
you took it out first once they're in
and it's harder for them to go back
you just pick them off
and here's the real question
what kind of hardware or equipment would
it take
to make sure
that you could take out their
anti-aircraft on the ground
before they can take out your whatever
it is that's taking out the
anti-aircraft
do you think that might have been maybe
some american equipment involved in that
you know i don't know if there would be
an american operator but there might be
american equipment
involved in that
somehow
um so
i do believe that it wouldn't be hard
for a ground-based anti-aircraft or
jamming to take out a drone
but
if we had missiles
that could be guided onto an incoming
transport let's say you had a spotter
this is a real thing right correct me if
i'm wrong if you have special forces
and they have a visual sight of an
incoming convoy
doesn't the special forces just put a
put a laser tag
on whatever they want to blow up
and then a missile arrives from some
distance split this in place
and it follows the laser pointer to the
exact target
right now wouldn't it be really hard to
shoot that missile down it would be a
lot harder than shooting down a drone
right
am i right about that
so i don't know what technology we have
for blowing up anti-aircraft stuff on
the ground but i would guess if you
could see it
that's all you need
if you have modern equipment
and you have a visual sight on it as it
comes in isn't it gone
i mean it's pretty much gone if you can
see it right
and then once once that's gone
i feel like you can just pick them off
so how many drones does
these high-end drones
how many of them does ukraine manage
i looked that up somebody said 10
i saw an article that said 20.
you know what the real answer is
how would we know
would we really know
and if they had 20 on
saturday
how many did they have on sunday
because they fly right i mean i don't
know how hard it is to deliver a drone
to a war zone
given that they fly
but
um ukraine seems to have lost five
drones somebody says you know
everything's fogger war so we don't
don't believe it an apache helicopter
would work
would work for what
yeah
so
um
all the videos about russia losing are
in telegram
but that would also suggest they're not
real
because if they're real they would jump
from telegram to the regular news pretty
quickly because the regular news would
love to show that story of russia losing
so there's something
not tracking here well there's a lot not
tracking
so here's my uh
here's my hypothesis
that in addition to all the stingers
you know what what about one of those
anti-tank weapons
if you had the high ground
and you could see a
military convoy coming by couldn't you
recognize and destroy
the anti-aircraft
stuff
pretty easily
i don't know so i'm guessing that the
ukrainians just have better equipment
than we think or they're using it better
and uh
i don't know i think we may have reached
a point in history
where as long as a country has access to
unlimited technology from the outside
nobody can conquer and hold them
and i think maybe having a border with
friendly countries is all you need
that as long as you have a border with a
friendly country
and there are other countries that are
willing to support you financially by
sending you unlimited military stuff
then nobody can hold the country because
it would just be too hard
because if you can put in one person's
hand
enough firepower to take out a building
which largely we have now
if one person with a handheld weapon can
take out a whole building or a tank
i don't know how you can hold the
country
all right russia stock market closed the
ruble is plummeting
sanctions iran the
russia
nuclear or i'm sorry central bank is
going to be
stalled in a variety of ways
and i guess putin's response to that was
to put his nuclear arsenal on some kind
of high alert
now i don't believe we have responded or
anybody's responded because that looks
like just posturing
looks like posturing
we hope
but
here's the question
uh i'm still seeing the the two world
reporting one is that the sanctions are
too weak
and putin will just ignore them and the
other is the sanctions are devastating
why don't we know that
don't you think that would be like a
basic thing to know about this story
maybe the most basic thing
the most basic thing about the story is
are the sanctions really going to make a
difference like are they the type that
would make a difference and apparently
we don't even know that
apparently we don't even know that
yeah so swift is kicked in there's you
know at least
partial
problem there you know some people say
hey crippling 80 of russia's banks will
plunge them into economic despair
and then other people are saying
well
putin only needs 20 of the banks he can
do whatever he wants so but i don't
think that's true either
yeah we're still buying russian oil
which is just the weirdest thing
but i suppose if they're willing to sell
it to us at a good price we should buy
we should buy it
um
none of them is real
well none of the information is real i'm
sure
germany says it's going to keep its
nuclear plants longer partly in response
to
feeling vulnerable in their energy
supply
so why did it take so long for germany
to decide to
extend its nuclear power plants
well it turns out we have a new little
report
about russia
apparently the russian
energy giant gazprom
and this is reported by
zion lights
she's saying an apparently dominique
renee reports i don't know who that is
that we found that gazprom funded
environmental ngos
non-government organizations that
provide ministers to various governments
such as belgium which then advocated
abandoning nuclear power in other words
the competitor to nuclear power the
russian competitor
had been funding disinformation
to get people to get out of nuclear
because nuclear was actually the better
solution
so
thank you russia
and do you remember when there was this
uh there was this guy i can't remember
his name maybe you can remember
he had a orange hair he was a president
for a while and he called uh he called
china
he said that
climate change was a chinese hoax
and it turned out to be a russian hoax
like actually literally a russian oaks
in the sense that
russia you know russia's um a
russia-owned
you know energy giant was literally
trying to disinform the public
to change the
the course of civilization away from
nuclear
which probably
is going to be one of the biggest
problems that ever happened in the
planet earth
according to the
climate people
all right so thanks for that
um
this story of course the next story was
i saw on fox news
so you're gonna have to give it a grain
of salt for
the bias because when they talk about
their competitors
it's always interesting and it's funny
but remember it's somebody reporting on
their competitor so they're going to
paint them in a bad light
but
i guess tom cotton i didn't see it but
tom cotton was on abc news with
stephanopoulos
and stephanopoulos apparently reportedly
was getting uh frustrated
because he couldn't make tom cotton
insult
trump
to which i say
why was trump
really even the topic
now we get that he made some decisions
he's you know he said good things about
putin
but cotton was uh refusing just saying
you know you should have trump on if you
want to talk to him
and and tom cotton just focused on you
know the actual real issues
and
apparently that was a terrible thing
because abc only wanted to use the
opportunity
of this event that has nothing to do
with trump to make it an anti-trump
story
and and they're still trying to torture
the fact
that trump plays to putin's ego and
calls him smart
they're trying to make that into a story
negative about trump
when in fact
he's the smartest person in the game
because you should absolutely tell putin
he's smart
while you're you know arming ukraine
and while you're doing everything you
can to minimize his impact you should
totally call him smart
because you take away one ego reason for
him to act irrationally
you want putin attack rationally
so don't give him a reason to act
irrationally don't make it personal
trump is just a better negotiator
do you know what
here's some advice for tom cotton
you should say i don't know trump is the
salesperson does the salesperson usually
insult the buyer
and then just be done
and if he asks the question again well
but do you think it was wise to praise
putin like that i would just say the
same answer again
and trump is a salesperson he tells you
he's a salesperson
he tells you what he's selling he even
tells you how he's selling it
he does it right in front of you
transparently
he's selling
something to putin
do you want your salesperson to insult
the customer or to sell the way sales
has worked since the beginning of time
where you praise the customer you tell
them they're making excellent choices
and then you work with them to persuade
them in the direction you want which one
which one works
i i i think the next politician who's
asked to answer for trump
just needs to go high ground and just
slap the out of whoever's asking
the question
i mean you know with words not with
slapping
am i right
it's the easiest defense you could ever
have
trump's a salesperson
is he supposed to insult the customer
well how would you do it
how would you play it stephanopoulos
what's your plan insult the guy you're
negotiating with
when has that ever worked
in the history
in the history of all negotiations from
the beginning of time when is that ever
worked your idea so why don't you defend
why you think it's a problem
to negotiate
exactly the way it has always worked
since the beginning of time
so stephanopoulos do you have access to
some kind of new research
that says the thing that has always
worked
everywhere in every context
won't work in this one case
i mean you should have turned it around
and just and just crushed him
because the opportunity was there
i think i would have done it
all right
did i see in the comments somebody said
the ruble's down 30
doesn't matter i don't know
we're seeing uh bitcoin being uh part of
the story
bitcoin part of the story so i guess
people are donating this i heard it was
a million dollars so far to ukraine
which is
really not enough to make a difference
in anything but it does show that
crypto might be a necessary tool against
despots
meaning that if the people in ukraine
think it's money
well it's money
if if they treat it like money it's
money
so
um
russia is using crypto everybody's using
crypto at this point i think
russian interest rates went from 9.5 to
20 percent now uh i imagine that putin
is uh telling the public it's temporary
have we heard anything like that
where we are
um yeah it's temporary he's gonna go all
biden on that it's transient it's
totally transient
don't get all worried about this
transient stuff
yep transitory inflation that's what
he's going to say
all right
there's really nothing else happening
except the war am i right
um red cross needs donations for poland
somebody says
uh no videos of russia sucking
well there's no
i'm just really puzzled by the lack of
video
yes and does it seem that kovan was
cured by war
so we're not hearing about durham we're
not hearing
i i don't think the war is a diversion
from those things
yeah the trucker convoy we're not
hearing about anything
um new york city is lifting vacs
passports march 7th
now
i saw a headline
about schools no longer needing masks
either now or very soon but that's not
true
is it
that was fake news right because
my local school still has masks as far
as i know
what do you expect from the state of the
union
uh is that tomorrow
when is the state of the union tomorrow
or is it today tomorrow
well um i would agree with what i saw in
the news
that biden is probably rewriting the
state of the union and he might rewrite
it right up to the moment of the speech
itself because i think events in
ukraine are going to have to be
mentioned in their most current form
and who knows
in 24 hours who knows
now
well yes somebody's writing it
yeah gold is is gold still going up
i've never understood gold
as a store of value
i've never owned gold
because you know i get that it would
have made sense you know in retrospect
wouldn't it have been nice if i had five
percent gold or something
but
uh
i've never understood it because gold is
the one thing that could go to a very
low price very quickly i realized it has
industrial use and jewelry use and that
but once you get past its actual
industrial application
i just wouldn't put money in something
that's uh that
sensitive now that said i do have a
small amount of crypto in my portfolio
but that's
diversification
and some of it was accidental
um
gold has a limited supply does it
i don't know does it
all right
gold usually has tungsten inside
and we need that for what some
technology
you are uninformed
well yes i realize that gold is is
technically exactly limited okay i get i
get your point
but remember we thought oil was limited
and then fracking was invented
right
if you think that gold is limited
forever
i would say
i don't know what if somebody invents a
new way to find it
or a new way to extract it
what if somebody invents a way to create
it
you think we could never get to the
point where we could artificially create
gold
i don't know maybe we can't but if we're
doing fusion
i got a feeling we could make some
artificial
minerals at some point
so it does seem to me that there could
be a technical advance that would make
gold worthless
at some point
i don't know about asteroids
yeah fillings for teeth
except i don't think you do you want a
gold
i don't know if you want gold
um
so maya is saying that the msm's
narrative as ukraine is a helpless
victim hence no videos of russia losing
so
you know i don't know who's our
ukrainian troll or or russian troll
but anybody who has some
confidence that they know what's
happening in these cities i'm going to
assume is a troll
is that fair
anybody who has confident
current predictions about what's
happening in kiev or
karkiv
i would say i wouldn't believe anything
that somebody said about those places at
the moment
you know maybe in 48 hours we'll know
what happened two days ago
but i wouldn't believe anybody who says
they know what's happening right now
none of that sounds real
all right
the fence in dc has been put back up i
wonder what that's about or maybe the
state of the union
the the ruble has been renamed the
rubble
oh now there's a
wow
the ruble is rubble i'm sure somebody's
thought of that one before but i like it
convoy so the trucker convoy is heading
to dc
is that worth doing
i don't even know what mandates are left
do
do american
does what mandates are left i don't even
know what they're fighting at this point
in the united states
it's a trap
yeah i would
i can't say i'm necessarily in favor of
a u.s trucker convoy
i'm not against it i would be uninformed
but i don't know what they're what are
they
what are they trying to get that isn't
going to happen on its own anyway
all right yeah i don't know what that's
about
um
so babak uh tagavi
has good videos you say
all right that's all i got for today so
i won't babble anymore and i will let
you go
and uh shall we talk again tomorrow
anybody yeah
caitlin says jesus
scott has absolutely no idea of what's
going on
caitlin
um
you may have heard that sometimes i say
harsh things about people
who make comments of this nature very
much of the nature of the comment you're
making
in the past
i do have a history
of going off on people who say things
like that
because first of all you idiot
that's what i'm saying
so in order to disagree with me
when i say i don't know what's going on
there
for you to say
scott scott scott you don't know what's
going on there may i do a short skit
involving you idiot and me
i'll first play the part of me
it's a fog of war i wouldn't believe
anything about anything that's coming
out of there in fact i don't think
anybody should trust any of the
information coming out of there and now
let me let me do you
 idiot
well scott
i don't think you know what's happening
over there
now back to me
yes idiot
that's exactly what i just said
you piece of
well
scott i think maybe you should do your
own research
okay
you're agreeing with me really really
hard here that i don't know what's going
on
and i don't know how to say it in a way
that's
different
and we'll get through to your thick
skull which is apparently entirely skull
material and no brain whatsoever on the
inside
i guess you don't know what's happening
in car keep okay
okay
all right
that's all i got for you today
thank you for the comments
and by the way
i don't know if you caught on to this
but
i don't know what's happening over there
in ukraine
i know
i know surprising admission
see you tomorrow
