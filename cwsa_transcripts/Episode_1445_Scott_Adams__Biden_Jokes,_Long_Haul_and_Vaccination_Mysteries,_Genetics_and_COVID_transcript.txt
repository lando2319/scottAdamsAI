well well well welcome to
another amazing episode of coffee with
scott adams
absolutely the best part of every day
for every person in the universe
and beyond and if you'd like to take it
up a notch and why wouldn't you
really um all you need is a copper bug
or glass tanker jealous
stein a canteen jogger flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
unparalleled the dopamine of the day the
thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip why is my video so bad
on youtube
some sums up with that all right
go
ah i've got some kind of a
brightness problem going on here
maybe because my other screens are too
bright well
have you heard of all the news i'm going
to start with
the most important news of the day and
then we'll work down to other stuff
okay
i see some people are having some
international issues with youtube
uh today i've got the paywall down for
just
this video uh on locals so look at my
tweet
if you want to see this same show
without the
commercials you want to see it live
look at my tweet it's got a link to go
over to locals
and there you can see it without
commercial breaks
and get a little sample of what the
the subscription service is like without
the subscription just for today
most important news of the day this was
from the daily mail
and i hope you didn't miss this very
very important
there was a according to the daily mail
there was a single
japanese man age 51 who almost
masturbated himself to death after
suffering a stroke
moments before he ejaculated now here's
the best part of the story in the daily
bail they'll give you the headline
but between the headline and the
detailed story they'll put bullet points
they give you the you know the summary
of the story
and in the bullet point
summary of this the single japanese man
almost masturbating himself to death
the daily mail
[Laughter]
i'll be laughing about this all day the
daily mail describes the man as a
a right-handed man in germany
they had to tell you he's right-handed
because yeah
you know good writing one of the
[Laughter]
well one of the elements of good writing
is that
you you make the picture a visual
i guess they didn't want it they didn't
want to leave it to chance
that you would imagine the wrong hand so
they told me he was right-handed
but they should have gone further
because
if you're right-handed this is
[Laughter]
this is something a girlfriend told me
when i was i think 19.
it's a she didn't make it up but she
said
use your left hand and it'll feel like a
stranger
this right-handed man almost jerks
himself to death
all right so to the daily mail
whoever whoever writes their summaries
that was the funniest summary
you'll ever see in your life a
right-handed man
oh i have to hope the rest of this is as
funny as that
oh sorry this was just about me amusing
myself
there'll be a portion of this later
where i try to entertain you too
but it will happen right away
all right sorry so victorian secret
uh has announced that uh
instead of their old business model
where they would have the
the angels you remember the angels were
the attractive models who would come out
and scanty
attire but they're going to abandon that
entire model maybe after this year
and instead of having uh attractive
women
scantily clothed to sell their
scanned clothing they're going to go
with
trailblazing women trailblazing women
including
trans women and at least one lesbian
and they've sort of they've decided to
drop the whole attractiveness
angle
and here's the thing
i think we all understand if somebody is
just totally sexist
it says hey i'm going to sell you some
sell you some
you know lingerie or whatever and we're
just going to use sex to do it
and it's all about you know sexy and raw
people
i guess they don't have to be hetero but
that part's optional
but um just go for it
i think we would all understand that
right
we'd say okay maybe that's not for me or
that doesn't address
my community or something but at least
you'd understand it
you know just the way you would
understand it if
if somebody said we have some other kind
of theme
but does it make sense that you're
selling sexy clothing
and you've abandoned the whole sex
appeal angle to
just sort of go for a generic women are
awesome
and trailblazers i feel like they're
going to have a
messaging problem here
a little bit of messaging problem now
i'm not i'm not saying i'm against it
because it's their business and they can
do what they want of course and being
more inclusive
perfectly good impulse so when you
wouldn't like to see more people being
you know open to all people so that that
part's good
the thing is do you take this concept
which is good
you know being being nice to all people
and being as inclusive as you can be
i love that part but does it have to be
everywhere
literally everybody's got to do it i
don't know
i'll just leave that to your opinion
um we have more information coming out
that uh kovid has a genetic
component there are boring studies which
are barely
just understandable to people with my
background
uh but it looks like some meta-analysis
has determined that there are 13 genetic
signatures that will determine whether
you get a bad outcome and then there was
another study i saw on the same topic
that seemed to show that different
ethnic groups around the world have very
different outcomes
now a question i asked that i didn't see
an answer to is
if you saw my tweet on this this morning
did the did the study say that
china would have the least problem with
it because of their genetic situation
can somebody give me a confirmation of
that because the
there's a gigantic problem with a
scientist
trying to communicate for whatever
reason
scientists need to communicate in the
way that's hardest to understand
now you can say to yourself but scott
that's just because you don't understand
the
you know the terms of art and you're not
in the industry but if you were
a scientist you could certainly read
their writing
and you would understand it because you
know you'd have the technical training
to do that no no
no no and no the reason i can't
understand it has nothing to do
well has something to do with my lack of
training
in the field but it's just bad writing
it doesn't have to be the way it's it's
presented in these technical
publications
clearly they're doing it to look
confusing
so it looks smarter i guess but there
there is no
there's not even a hand wave to be
incomprehensible
these are completely incomprehensible
written things
on top of the fact that you don't
understand the language it's just poor
writing
so the one thing i wonder and if
somebody could look at that what i
tweeted this morning and give me an
opinion
if you're better at discerning what they
say
um can you tell me if that's telling me
that this virus
coincidentally does not affect chinese
ethnic people as much i think you said
that
but you just can't tell the way it's so
poorly written
so let me know um i saw a tweet by uh
gentleman named well i don't want to
pronounce his first name incorrectly but
it's spelled
a-n-a-s
now i'd like to be respectful about
people's names
a couple of ways i could think to
pronounce this
his last name is uh alhaji i think
but let's say that you pronounce a-n-a-s
as
anas let's go with let's go with anaz
because anus sounds wrong but we'll go
with an ass
alaji and he noted in a tweet that
under biden the amount of
coal we're exporting to china
has gone through the roof now i think
it's probably not as high as it was
under obama but it's way higher than it
was under trump
so this green biden
administration maybe is using less coal
in the united states
we're just shipping it to china and then
china's just burning it and it gets in
the same atmosphere
either way so
this is yet another case where this
whole green
or not green situation is hard to
it's hard to analyze because most of it
is smoke and mirrors
um here's a question for you
if uh i i i i saw this in a
michael shellenberger tweet let me swit
uh
go down to that um
so as yeah michael schoelenberger was
tweeting that
the share of renewable power in
germany's
um situation is
uh let's say the renewable power is down
43 percent in the past year
so germany was big on renewable green
energy
but they got way less of it this year
and the reason is
uh unfavorable wind conditions and fewer
sunshine hours
now here's my question
if you know that the climate is changing
and if the climate is changing couldn't
you assume that that would affect
wind patterns so that for example you
had a place that was excellent for
windmills
but what if the climate changes is the
place that you put all the windmills
suddenly no good for windmills because
you can't put a windmill anywhere
you have to find the right you know win
situation
so could it be that climate change will
make
green technology less effective
so that wherever you put the windmills
they just stop being good places for
windmills
and then other places become good places
for windmills but there are no windmills
there
is that a thing because it seems to me
every
every every bit of logic about any of
this stuff says
nuclear energy is the only solution
so i just asked that question did
germany get bitten by climate change
by putting in the technology that's
right for climate change
green technology but then the climate
change made the green technology
not work did that just happen
i'm just speculating here that's not a
that's not a claim
but it looks like it might have happened
maybe
all right um let's talk about long-haul
coved
so adam dopamine on twitter asked a good
question
which is if if as the experts say
something like a quarter of all people
who get to covet
have some kind of long-haul symptoms
shouldn't you and i know some people
with long-haul symptoms by now
that's a pretty good question because
one of the
filters i teach you is that if science
is telling you one thing
but your observation your direct
observation is telling you another thing
you need to figure out which of those is
true and it's at least a flag
that you should maybe be a little
skeptical about the science now the
science could be right
science could be right and your direct
observation could be what's the illusion
but if those are in conflict then you
need to ask some more questions
and that's a fair question so i put down
a little
unscientific twitter poll and i think
something like last i checked i think 17
percent of the respondents said they did
know
somebody with long covent now given the
tens of millions of americans who have
had coven
30 million i forget the number but it's
tens of millions have had it
the question was wouldn't you know
somebody who's had long covered by now
because you'd almost certainly know
somebody who had coveted
and then a quarter of them would have
long covered theoretically
so wouldn't you know some but does it
make sense to you that 17
of the respondents do know
long covered yeah dr drew had long
covered
as you saying in the comments so i know
i think i know three or more people who
have had long covered
but here's another interesting question
which came to me from
a doctor who shall remain nameless
unless he wants to be named later
but how do we how do we
get statistics for long covet
how do you know you had long covet is it
because you had some problems
after you got the covet because
if all you're doing is looking at what
happened to you after you got covered
you could say that 100 of people who've
had coven will die
eventually it might be 40 years but
a lot of coincidences are going to
happen after any
any event how many people got really
sick after the super bowl
and continued to be sick for months lots
you know probably hundreds of thousands
just by coincidence
so how do you actually know if somebody
has
long covert i believe there are no
biomarkers
in other words you can't do a test on
somebody say oh yep
there you go we see that long covered in
you
we've got that on our slide in our our
microscope
i'm looking at some long cover there
there's nothing there
all you have is people reporting that
they have symptoms
so do you think that people imagining
symptoms
could inflate that number of people who
have long covered
all the way up to 25 when really
maybe it's a lot less maybe
that would be a reasonable um
skepticism now speaking of that
um there was a british study which i
think i wrote down
showing that the number of long coveted
people oh here it is
in great britain they did a study of
long coven and they found that
6.2 percent of adults may have
experienced
long coven since the start of the
pandemic
and that includes um you know like 40
of them are only people who who are
unsure
so of the six percent a large chunk of
the six percent weren't even positive
they're just like well i think maybe i
had long covert or maybe i just had some
problems that came after the code
so does that number sound more real
do you think it's 25 which would be oh
god or is it six percent or really not
even six percent
because some of them are unsure maybe
four percent
something like that which sounds which
sounds more true to you based on your
observation
just living in the world and knowing
people who've had coke etcetera
i don't know it doesn't seem like 25
does it
but six percent seems low i feel like
it's somewhere in between
but we but there's some question on that
that's all you need to know
all right
i saw karl rove take down the texas
democrats
who left town so that they would remove
the quorum and there couldn't be a vote
about the election reforms that texas
was hoping to do which the democrats
call
uh voter suppression and so karl rove
challenged the democrats he was he
appeared on fox news
and he sort of challenged them on a
point by point
of the new proposed texas law to explain
to him and the world
why they are voter suppression and i
watched karl rove just go through each
of the
texas law proposed changes
and none of them look like voter
suppression to me in fact they all look
like
voter protection or voter increase
and i thought to myself
why is it that karl rove has to come on
fox with his little white board
and and he's just a pundit right karl
rove is not the news
karl rove is somebody the news invites
on to talk
so why does karl rove have to be the
person to tell us what the
law says and to show us that there's no
correlation with
voter suppression and do you believe it
if the only thing you've seen is one
pundit giving you their argument which
seems pretty airtight
should you say well i'm done i know
everything i know now
because karl rove just explained it to
me
nope now i do think
that karl rove is probably more credible
than
most pundits right i think he would be
toward the top of
people who if they say something on tv
it's probably true
right so even though he has high
credibility
in my opinion um
you should never ever believe one person
giving
one point of view
do the notifications work on locals as
far as i know they do
i mean i haven't read any complaints
that was a question on
youtube um so
where is the show in which you have a
karl rove type person saying here are
all the
law here are the details of the law and
you can see clearly that they do not
cause any voter suppression where is the
other person sitting next to him
a democrat let's say who says no no no
karl rove
i see what you're saying but you're
misinterpreting this one or
you're leaving one out or you're not
seeing the
the real reason behind this one where's
that
there's no news today there's no news
today
right it's only people talking and
that's not news because there's no
context
you can't you can't figure out even if
it matters
so i will give a big standing ovation to
karl rove for being the first person
i've seen
to even attempt to explain what the
freaking law says
so that we can make up our own mind if
the democrats are being reasonable
we need that someday somebody's going to
make that show
and probably it's going to be on the
internet and not on a network
because i don't think the networks can
give you any kind of balance to anything
but if i had a little bit better
technology
than i have now because what i'd want to
do is live stream it
and have multiple guests and right now
i'm not aware of any technology that's
quite good enough to do that
there's technology to do it but it's not
good enough there's
there are issues that i don't want to go
into but we're close
as soon as we get to the point where i
could just easily call people up and say
all right you're a guest on this side
you're a guest on the other side
i'll be your i'll be your referee then
i'll do that
somebody says just ask viva and barnes
how they do it
um they do not have three people on they
have two
so i would need to see a model with at
least two guests
but i think those are all recorded
they're not live and i'd want to do it
live
um apparently uh we learned now that
the fbi had 4500 tips about brett
kavanaugh
and his alleged sexual improprieties for
which there is no evidence whatsoever
but there are 4 500 tips and
democrats of course are using this as
evidence that the investigation into him
was not
complete or even valid but
how many tips do you think would be the
right amount you would expect
of fake tips given the
given the size of the kavanaugh story
and its importance
how many tips would you expect to get
i would expect to get about 5 000 tips
that were just
so do you think the fbi is good at
knowing what kind of tips look
reasonable and which ones do not
well they're better than us probably
better than you and i could do
but i don't think the fbi looks into
tips
do they do you know how many tips law
enforcement gets about everything
what percentage of tips can any law
enforcement look into
a few i mean none
i don't know that anybody really looks
into tips except in strange
situations uh
yeah how many tips came in on biden
exactly so put some context on this
how unusual is it that thousands of tips
would be ignored by the fbi
i feel like it's normal because they
would just look at him and say no
i don't think so probably not
all right i guess the biden
administration
is looking at including having women
sign up for the draft or register for
the draft now we don't have a draft
but the registering is just in case
and i guess men ages 18 through 24 have
to register for the draft
and here's my question to you how many
of you men registered for the draft
um i'd really be interested in that
so i know a lot of you are watching this
are older
and i think at some age many of you did
but maybe i should ask it the other way
how many of you did not register for the
draft but should have legally
i feel like i asked the question wrong i
should have just asked how many did not
because those are the ones that are
interesting
it's illegal not to register it's
illegal but i think the penalty is
something like you can't get student
loans or
something like that it's not a big
penalty
oh most states auto register when you
get a driver's license
oh okay i didn't know about that
can you get a security clearance good
question probably not
yeah um
well i know people who did not register
for the draft and
had no consequences whatsoever
but i won't name names um so biden was
asked on a viral
video that's going around today um
somebody asked them are there democrats
who want to defund the police
now is that a good question is that a
reasonable question to ask joe biden are
there any democrats who want to defund
the police
no that is a dumb question because
every large organization
be they democrats or be their
republicans
have some of everything don't you think
there are some republicans who want to
defund the police
i mean i've never met one but probably
probably because there's there's
somebody everywhere do you think there
are any murderers rapists or racists or
democrats
of course are there any of those people
who are republicans of course
of course are there any people who are
you know
pedophiles and you know
ex-convicts who are democrats of course
are there any republicans who are yeah
of course
every group has everything so asking
biden if there are any democrats who
want to defund the police it's just
a dumb question so biden's answer was
and i'm paraphrasing are the republicans
who think democrats want to drink the
blood of children
now i saw a number of people tweeting
this around like
he was just sort of random and crazy
as if it were a you know a brain dead
response
it wasn't brain dead at all i i'm gonna
try to be
objective about biden as i was as best i
could about trump he's harder to be
objective about
but objectively speaking this was a
great answer
it's just that for some reason
republicans didn't see it that way and
you know subjectivity is pretty strong
it was a good answer
because he was brushing it away as
ridiculous
and and essentially said what i did
which is you can find
somebody in every group are there any
democrats who want to defund the police
of course there are do you need the
president to tell you that
you can observe it directly what good
would it be
to have biden answer that question
because you already know the answer
but he makes it ridiculous and wipes it
away by saying are there any republicans
who think democrats want to drink the
blood of children well there are
there are not many of them but they
exist
so i'm going to say that the the call on
that that
you know it shows that biden does some
brain damage or something i say it's the
opposite
i say this was a very quick and clever
response
and it became viral so he gets he gets
points for that too
so uh i'm gonna go against the grain
there and say that was a good biden
response
all right what else is happening these
days
here's a question for you so more and
more we're hearing that people who
are vaccinated can get the virus
and there's some thought that maybe in
israel
i think maybe in great britain i'm not
sure that we're already seeing a
reduction
in the effectiveness of i think mostly
the pfizer shot
but i'm not sure about that either and
here's my question once you've accepted
that people who have the vaccination can
still
quite easily get the the virus you know
they have lower
lower symptoms of course but they can
get the virus and
also spread it once you've accepted that
is that a vaccination is it
or wouldn't you call it a therapeutic
because if there's a chemical you put in
your body that reduces the symptoms of
something
but doesn't prevent you from getting it
the way a normal vaccination prevents
you from getting smallpox
it doesn't treat it it prevents you from
getting it
so is this a vaccination
well i take you back and i saw in the
comments somebody got ahead of me a
little bit
you remember that one of my predictions
that i considered as
semi-right and maybe a little bit more
wrong than right
was i said that we would develop a
therapeutics
faster than anybody imagined and i
thought that vaccinations
might be years off does anybody remember
me saying that
so i considered that a bad uh
a bad prediction because the
vaccinations were not years off
they came pretty quickly and then the uh
the therapeutics seemed to take a while
before they kicked in a little little
slower than i thought but still faster
than maybe we would have expected
it seems to me that the vaccination is
just a therapeutic
and that we did in fact develop an
ass kicking therapeutic if you looked at
the vaccinations as a therapeutic
they're great if you look at it as a
vaccination
i'm not even sure they qualify as a
vaccination to do that
so we may have to develop a new category
or a new word
for something that's not quite a
vaccination but you wouldn't quite call
it a therapeutic
because you take it you know
prophylactically
so what is it it's a it's a
vexopedic let's call it a vaccipudic
there you go are you just word thinking
yes um but it gets to the question of
whether a vaccine was in fact developed
for covet
i don't think we made a vaccine i think
we made a therapeutic that's just really
really good
and whoever said that's worth thinking
your
comment is accepted because i don't
think it matters
it is what it is so you can call it
whatever you want
all right uh that
is pretty much what i wanted to say
today
um and did i leave out any
important topics
it's a it's a leaky vaccine somebody
says
it's a theravax yeah theravax
what would happen if we just
um what happens if we all just
started calling it a therapy and
calling it a therapy for long a
therapeutic for long covert
what if he called it that would more
people get it if you said
well it's not really a vaccine per se
or of a therapeutic and it's preventing
long haul which maybe you have a
between 6 and 25 chance of getting would
that make more people take it
and and do you care you know when i see
the numbers of people dying who are
vaccinated being
like so small that you can ignore them i
mean unless it's your family then you
can't
i don't feel like i'm in a pandemic i
feel like other people are in a pandemic
but i'm not
and what's going to happen when the
people who are vaccinated
realize that society got closed down
again because the people who are
not do we have a problem coming
all right is it going to be like sheep
and cattle where the vaccinated and the
unvaccinated have to fight to the death
because if you're unvaccinated and it
feels like you're the cause of me having
to wear a mask in public or
not being able to shop i suppose um
i don't know does that give me an
attitude about you or do i just say well
you made your choice i made mine
we'll both will both live on our choice
because i feel like your choice is
affecting my choice
right now my current opinion is that
it's not up to me whether you get
vaccinated and i don't give a
whether you do or not
beyond that i also don't care if you die
now
i mean i have normal empathy for humans
and tragedies etc
but in terms of decision making it's not
part of my decision making
whether you take the vaccine or not
because your your risk and your
life are for you to manage not for me to
manage but
what happens when your choice starts
managing my life
because that's what's going to happen
right here i am with no
no real risk that you know doesn't round
to zero
and my life will be completely
determined in the next year
by what you do am i wrong about that
that my life will be completely
determined
by what other people do that's true
wouldn't you say
now to to take the leap
i'm not taking the leap i'm not taking
the leap that says and therefore you
need to get vaccinated like me
that's too far that would be unethical
for me to make that claim
but it is nonetheless true that your
choices
you unvaccinated people will completely
determine
my life however my choice
of getting vaccinated will have no
impact on you
except good it will reduce the odds of
you know lockdowns and whatever but
i want to see a counter to that so one
crother says wrong um and that you're a
sheep
um am i a sheep are you a
because one of those are probably true
now i would say
that if you look at the cost benefit of
something and you make a personal
decision about your cost benefit
that calling that person a sheep would
make you just a because
people do make cost-benefited analyses
and make decisions
so you're a sheep all the
people who are so dumb to think
that
anybody else want to take her on it and
show us how stupid you are
because there are some things that are
just opinions
and i don't get it i don't get down on
people for their opinions
even if they disagree but if you think
that making a cost-benefit decision in a
pandemic
and it happens to be the same as the
medical community
if you think that makes you a sheep as
opposed to somebody who
analyzed something and made a decision
you're a
right don't don't think that's an
opinion
that's a comment about yourself right
that's how you scream to the world i'm a
because i think that people who make
different decisions are
small wool-covered animals no we're just
people who made a different decision
than you did
maybe our risk is different maybe our
concerns are different
but if you think that makes you a sheep
you're a
all right so just live with that
somebody says maybe it will be the other
way around and the vaccinated will
decide the lives of the rest
if there were enough vaccinations that
would be true because then the
vaccinated people would cause us to open
up
what about natural immunity what about
it
why would a vaccinated person need to
wear a mask because they can still
seriously why are you still asking that
question
i i sometimes i'm just amazed
at how the information about the
pandemic is not universal
um you might be required to wear a mask
when you're vaccinated because
vaccinated people do catch and do spread
the virus did you not know that
was there somebody here who didn't know
that by now
now i'm not saying you should wear a
mask i think you shouldn't because your
risks are so low
if you're vaccinated and also your risk
of spreading it i think
are low but we'll we'll find out more
about that
so no i don't think uh i'm going to be
wearing
masks if i can avoid it at all
but there's a reason you just have to
decide how big that reason is
um why don't we need polio booster shots
because the ones we have
work obviously we don't have a
vaccination
we have a therapeutic so if you're
asking me why do you need more than one
shot
it might be the same reason you need
more than one of every therapeutic
is there any therapeutic that you take
once and you're done
probably not right you probably have to
take a pill every now and then
or you know get more than one iv yeah
maybe the ivs are just one so i don't
know
um let's see
last week you were ridiculing well i'm
not saying this
really people call these a therapeutic
an mri and not a vaccine
what happened to change your mind well
that never happened
so whatever you hallucinated i was doing
didn't happen
i i was not ridiculing anybody who
called it a therapeutic
that simply never happened
if i ever told you that almost all of
the things i get in trouble with
and indeed almost every problem in my
life
both personal and professional is based
on people believing i did something or
said something that never happened
is that unique to me because i'm a
public figure because
even even in my private life most of my
problems
are somebody who believes i said or did
something that never happened
in my marriage for example nearly all of
my problems are based on things that
didn't happen
all right somebody says my late wife did
that to me all the time
um told us more than a few times
i don't know what you're talking about
um wow someone with the same problem
yeah i guess i have told you that that's
right
you're right i have told you more than a
few times all right
um
government determined not a hipaa
violation to ask vaccine questions
yeah i don't see how that's not a hipaa
violation
but in the pandemic i guess all rules
are off
your definition of the jab has already
changed
because the data changed
what do you do do you you don't change
your mind when the data changes
like what how do you play it when i get
new information
i sometimes revise my opinion
it's not a violation to ask because you
don't have to answer
okay technically i guess that's true
um uh
what's that about the locals app uh
oh predictions about kneeling teams now
that the olympics began
well i've always said that teams that
kneel should perform
worse than teams that don't don't we
have enough data on that because there
should be enough
professional games that we would have a
pretty good look at that
but i don't know if you would know
exactly how a team should have performed
is there a way to
tease that out because maybe only bad
teams did it i mean that's possibility
wouldn't our energy be better served
figuring out where this came from and
punishing the bad actors
i don't think there's any way to punish
the bad actors
i don't all right that's all for now and
i will talk to you on youtube
tomorrow
