to the highlight of civilization better
than ever really today is going to be a
burden a burner yeah and if you'd like
to enjoy this at the maximum potential
all you need is a copper mugger a glass
of tanker chalice or Stein the canteen
jogger flask of vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure what
got her with a microphone on
the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it happens now
go
ah that's the best thing ever
thank you Paul over on locals that
little graphic you have of that so on
the locals uh platform
one of the members always puts up a
little graphic to tell me if my sound is
working on both platforms oh my God is
that useful
that is so useful I so appreciate that
thank you Paul glider let's go privately
over here on
we're going to put the locals people
private so when I turn off YouTube later
they'll have their little special time
now
are you wondering why I'm in such a good
mood
are you wondering why I'm so damn happy
this morning I mean I'm like crazy happy
well number one
the the rains have stopped and we've got
a sunny California week
now if you've not enjoyed a sunny
California week they're pretty awesome
but I haven't seen one in a while so all
excited about that yesterday was amazing
but it's even better
I had a book deadline which is today
actually
and that meant I had to get all of my
first round of edits done which are
really hard
because editing writing is hard
but editing to an editor's changes when
those changes involve moving parts
around
it becomes this huge Rubik's Cube so
instead of writing
which you're also doing as you're fixing
stuff you're also holding in your mind
the entire book
hundreds of different sections and how
like one phrase may have been more about
this chapter than the other and so you
have to hold all of it in your head and
then
then move it in different places like a
it's almost like programming really
you're moving like sections of code
around to be in the right place it's the
hardest thing I do
period it's the hardest thing I ever do
and the reason I'm so funny that I'm so
uh
happy today
is that I finished it a few hours early
and submitted it last night
there is no better day in the life
of an author
there's no better day than the day
you've submitted your stuff and you know
it's a book
now the next status will be a little
more work but it's a book
nothing can stop it like until you
submit the you know the final or first
round of edits really until you submit
those
you're not entirely sure you have a book
you you've worked for a year
you wasted it you know you could
potentially waste a year of your life
because it takes all of your free time
all of it
and today I know it's a book
so somebody says what about the day your
trophy wife left you
was that supposed to be my best day I'm
not sure what that cut there's somebody
there's somebody who mentions my wife or
ex-wife on on every topic
so let me tell you my latest uh
troll uh technique
so you know I'm still of course every
day I get you know loads of uh insults
and yesterday I was looking through the
uh the media stories about me you know
there's a sub stack about me how
terrible I am and there's uh and there's
a whole bunch of yes last few days a
bunch of media reports about me now
here's the funny thing
none of them were even close to accurate
they were just so wildly
mischaracterizing me in my situation
what I'm thinking and what I've done
it's all it's all just completely
fiction
and it's become so funny
that I'm just going to do an LOL on all
of it
because there's nothing to say about it
I mean you'd have to go back a year and
fix like a hundred different you know
misconceptions
so
it's all just LOL now so I'm having a
great week just looking at all the all
the stories about me that are just
ridiculous
Rasmussen as a poll 58 of people polled
are considered important that a company
shares their social and political values
including 28 who think is very important
this feels like a big problem now even
though most people the vast majority
according to the rasmic simple most
people think that the product is the
most important thing right
so most people say yeah it's a product
oh yeah 28 is very close to one quarter
it's very close to one quarter
yes I saw the uh the Trump
um retweet of my endorsement on truth
that was cool
um
so anyway here's my question
as we become more awoke and when people
are putting more pressure on companies
to do stuff
um
don't you think we almost need like a
new
I feel like we almost need a new
Constitutional Amendment
because
aren't we all better off the government
and religion are separate
well it wasn't that like one of the
smartest things
that we oh you say no well I mean we're
based we're the Constitution is based on
a sort of a Christian
bias if you can say that so I suppose
you could say that in some ways it is a
religious document they just they just
have some walls that say don't get your
religion in with the workings of the
government now I think
I think that's worked
I think that's worked but I wonder if we
should do the same thing for business
don't you think the worst thing you
could do to the economy of a country
is mix your politics and with the
business because we already have laws
right if the companies are following the
laws
I feel like I'm done I mean I can have
my opinion and stuff but I don't want my
opinion
to put them out of business
if they're following the law
now I might want to change the law
that's a thing I can see that I might
want to ban some companies that are
especially bad but should we really be
trying to micromedage companies that
feels like the worst thing you can do I
I almost think like we need some kind of
standard
to keep our business out of it
now I do like transparency
so to the extent that the external
pressure causes them to be more
transparent that's probably good but I
feel like there's a better way to get
there
so I don't like having more government
regulations but
separating religion from government I
think worked and now we might at least
think about it for separating
politics and business because it's just
crushing businesses am I wrong about
that
isn't the politics of it just crushing
businesses that didn't need to get
crushed now they should also stay out of
it
so if you if you've made an argument
that says well
if Disney for example let's say Disney
decides to enter an argument that's a
political argument well
you know then then maybe then maybe
they're you know
they're putting themselves out there for
a little pushback
but if they're minding their own
business and obeying all the laws
I think we should stay away from them
let them do what they want
but you know it would probably help the
businesses to make it illegal
it would probably be a boon to business
wouldn't it because let's say you're the
CEO
and your let's say your customers and
your employees and stockholders are all
yammering at you hey be more awoke or be
more political or say something about
climate change what's the CEO going to
do
pretty much bow to the pressure right
but what if the CEO had backing backing
them
a law
and the law said you you can't speak out
as a company on a political item you can
speak out personally
personally of course but companies can
have an opinions oh how about that
companies can't have political opinions
they can do what they want to do
and the individuals can have any
opinions they want
how about that and how about at the same
time we say you can't be fired for your
political opinion
how about that
can't be fired for your political
opinion
even if you say something on social
media that the company doesn't like yeah
I feel like there are a few tweaks we
could make to account for the fact that
social media changed the balance of
power
because because I think the regular
media you know had some balance
with with business but social media is
the wild west and now it's just forcing
business to respond to basically the
randomness of social media that's that
can't be good in the long run anyway I
don't have the I don't have the best
idea for fixing that but something needs
to be done
um here's what I don't like to say
we should have a national conversation
about that
I hate hearing that
because I'm I'm actually criticizing
myself at the moment for bringing up
something I didn't have a better idea
for
like probably shouldn't do that I mean
I'm just throwing out that
Constitutional Amendment thing but even
I don't think that's necessarily a good
idea just put it down there
all right let's talk about uh
are you aware that China built a
technology
and it's got a user interface
where China can control the minds of
Americans
actually through the interface did you
know that
how many of you knew that there's
actually a user interface that China can
control the the minds of Americans like
literally no joke that's a real thing
how many of you do that
yeah it's called Tick Tock and people
think it's something else now
here's the thing
why is it that Congress has enacted on
tick tock
because if you said to them do you know
that the Chinese government literally
not hyperbolically actually literally
has built a tool that they can tweak
very easily with the user interface to
change the minds
of Americans to change our minds
on important political things
now nobody nobody doubts that social
media can do that
right is there anybody who's had social
media doesn't change anybody's mind no
everybody does that
everybody knows that China controls Tick
Tock and now we know from article and
Forbes The Tick Tock literally has a
button
that any employee I guess some employees
can can touch it's called the heat heat
button they touch one button and they
can make any uh any content on Tick Tock
go viral
they can make it go viral with one
button
now let me ask you this
I don't use tick tock is there anybody
here who uses Tick Tock must be some of
you
bunch of you use tick tock
all right so for the not very many of
you actually that's good but for those
who do let me ask this question
have you seen a lot of anti-fentanyl
content on tick tock
you know a lot of content about the
overdoses and a number of people dying
and and specifically where it's coming
from
have you seen that is Tick Tock just
full of the biggest issue for young
people because Tick Tock skews younger
right younger and what is the number one
cause of death for young people
it's actually drug overdose and guns but
uh oh well actually that's a good
comparison I'm assuming that since the
two biggest problems for young people
death wise would be guns
an issue that the left likes
um and then Sentinel
right so those of you who use tick tock
if you want to wonder hey is this Tick
Tock already being weaponized against
Americans it would be easy it would be
easy to check is it a check all you'd
have to do is see is there more viral
content
about mass shootings and how guns should
be banned
and does it roughly match the
anti-fentanyl information especially
mentioning that it comes from China
all right
right so so you could you could easily
check could you
um why somebody saying not guns
I don't know what you I don't know what
not guns means
they must have plenty of content that's
anti-gun am I wrong
does Tic Tac have
anti-gun content or not
I'm just assuming that it leans left on
that topic Am I Wrong give me a fact
check on that I guess there's not enough
Tick Tock users on here to to fact check
me as I go but it's easy to check right
now why why would Congress ignore this
do you think China would ignore it if we
built a user interface to control their
youth and that was working it totally
works nobody's questioning whether it
works
I don't think they would ignore it
that's why the young people in China
can't use tick tock they have a
different version in China that's a safe
version yeah
so
it's possible that Congress isn't doing
nothing because they're all bought off
but there's another possibility
Congress is too old to understand the
topic
Congress is too old
to understand the topic
that's my current thinking and and I'll
be a little more specific
if if you had never been on Tick Tock or
you'd never use let's say Instagram and
most of them probably you know have
somebody else send a tweet and maybe
they know a little Twitter maybe they
got some Facebook going on but they're
not really
social media consumers so much they're
more like more like producers not
consumers
now if you're a consumer
and you've done what I did which is you
pick up Instagram you say oh
I wonder if there's any good like
Instagram stuff
and then you spend about a second
scrolling and you feel your entire body
being taken over
okay I'm actually a trained hypnotist
and I know exactly what's happening to
me right now and I can't stop scrolling
kitten pictures and it's feeding me
infinite Jordan Peterson videos and
they're all good and what are these
attractive women I like looking at I
think I'm done doing the live stream
because I Can't Take My Eyes Off of
these reels
now
I understand social media
at a
cellular level
a cellular level I understand social
media with my I'm sorry
I promise I wouldn't do that this year I
understand social media with my body
I didn't read an article about it if you
read an article that says oh this this
social media is pretty
it's pretty sticky you know maybe people
will be hooked on it like we all know
logically it's addicting right
but if you haven't used it
you have no idea how addicting this
would you agree with that
that if you haven't used it yourself and
experienced the the pull you you could
feel Tick Tock or Instagram I in sort of
a similar thing you can feel Instagram
take over your body
you can feel it
taking over your body
right if you can't if you've never
experienced the feeling I don't think
you would take it seriously
because there are a number of members of
Congress follow me on Twitter
they've seen my they've seen all of my
tweets for a lot of them and they know
that people say hey Tick Tock is
addictive and it can influence people
if about if I did a quiz of all the
members of Congress they would all get
the right answer don't you think you
know does
does social media Influence People
yes I'll bet every one of them would get
the right answer
does tick tock influence people yes
right answer is Tick Tock controlled by
China
yes
I believe that Congress would get all
the right answers in the quiz every one
of them probably every one of them
but I'll bet there are very few
who've used it
if you used it
you're going to kick it to the curb
really fast because you feel it and
you've also had the experience of you
all
ah
just listen to this and you've all had
the same experience so mine is not
unique
I have considered
and talked with friends about maybe
taking singing lessons
vocal lessons
because yeah I've learned the drums and
tried to learn the guitar and I was just
curious whether anybody could learn to
sing and I have you know no skill or
aptitude and so I was kind of curious
I've never written it down I don't think
I've never tweeted it
and my and my
my advertisements are full of vocal
Essence being offered
full of vocal Essence now do you have or
is your feed full of vocal lessons no I
never wrote that down
never wrote it down but I said it out
loud
said it out loud
now do you think that Congress you know
the the 80 year old people in Congress
do you think that they've experienced
talking about something in the privacy
of their home and then watching it show
up on their feed
do you think they've experienced that
maybe a few the younger ones you know
AOC has I'm sure
but I don't think that Congress is young
enough
to have actually you know mind melded
themselves with social media
to know how powerful it is
so I'm thinking it's actually an
information problem
as in you can't communicate to somebody
What a Feeling feels like
right
like intellectually they all get it but
I don't think they know what it feels
like if they did it'd be over there
would be no Tick Tock if if the if
Congress used it for a week it would be
gone that's my first that's my best
hypothesis because it could be just
corruption it could be exactly what it
looks like
China just owns the Congress it's
possible
well antifa is back and uh there's no
reason they ever disappeared and there's
not really a strong reason they came
back
but as Tucker Carlson uh
conspiratorially suggests
they're nothing but the military
arm of the Democrats
and they come whenever the Democrats
want to tell the public that the country
is falling apart and they need to trade
out the leader
so the first leader they got rid of was
Trump
and it started looking like they want to
get rid of Biden
so antifa might be a way to get rid of
Biden
because it just makes the country look
unstable because they get so much news
coverage
now apparently antifa people uh instead
of being executed which seems like you
know the obvious play uh are being just
released
but in but I think in Atlanta they're
going to be a little tougher on them the
Atlanta police say they're going to
charge them so we'll see
um
I think I'm going to agree with this
take
I'm going to agree with the stake
antifa appears to be an entirely
artificial Democrat
Army
I don't believe that all the members of
antifa know what they are or why they're
there
I think a lot of them are in it for the
lifestyle
and to you know meet women it's the only
way they can
um
but I think that the leaders the leaders
are working for a paycheck and if we
don't know who's paying them
um I think classifying them as domestic
terrorists and also Democrats is
accurate
now they wouldn't identify as Democrats
because they're uh you know they're for
chaos but
consider the fact that they're not
asking for anything
just just that just that alone they're
not asking for anything
are we done
there's nothing else you need to know
about them
if they're burning cities and not asking
for like some specific demand
and they're not asking for anything that
could be provided right no it's
obviously to create chaos and obviously
somebody's paying them
so it's a what if everything is exactly
the way it looks
all right more on that
on that note
it turns out that there is a FBI agent
I don't I don't even know what to say
about this story The the story is so
mind-boggling
that you just there's no comment on top
of it
they can do anything to make it more
outrageous
but so the federal prosecutors are going
after the head of former head of the
counterintelligence for the FBI New York
office they're saying you laundered
money
from some Russian oligarch apparently
was a same one who was giving money to
uh manifer
of course so sure enough
the FBI guy I think he was in charge of
making sure this didn't happen
was doing it himself
so once again
the the the Tucker Carlson theory that I
thought was batshit crazy batshit crazy
that the Democrats do whatever they're
accusing you of
every time every time it comes true this
is exactly what they're accusing
Republicans of they were doing it they
were literally taking money this guy was
literally taking money from Russia and
probably using it in service of
Democrats
it was exactly what you thought
yeah and the the
you know the pandemic looks like it's
going to be exactly what you thought
your worst suspicions
everything is exactly what you think
it just seems exactly what you think
so
uh anyway I'm fascinated by that but
let's take that concept that everything
is exactly what you think to the fact
that there are more classified documents
that yet another Joe Biden home
now
let's discuss
how it looks
number one nobody can explain why Joe
Biden has so many homes
we should be done
that that should be the end of his term
right that he should be like immediately
swept out of office with one sentence
nobody knows how he got all those homes
nobody knows
there's there's no Theory there's no
hypothesis
we just decide not to talk about it
what
is the president we're not going to talk
about how he mysteriously got
a great wealth without having a job that
provided that much income
no nobody's curious
well what if
that's exactly what it looks like
he's been on the take for decades that's
what it looks like
and so what if it's exactly what it
looks like now apparently he had
classified documents like a snail Trail
wherever he went
you know now I speculated that he was
leaving the document so he could find
his way back from wherever he went I
don't know if that's true just
speculation
but
three locations so far right
three is a pattern
one could be a mistake
two could be a mistake three is a pretty
clear pattern especially since it's
documents that aren't predate his
presidency
now in these same homes
we we presume that Hunter Biden had
access to all three places correct
Hunter Biden had easy access to all
three places
and we know that he was trying to sell
at least influence to foreign countries
so what it looks exactly like is that
Joe Biden for decades has been a huge
Criminal
for decades a huge Criminal
and that Hunter is part of monetizing it
and that they've been
offering or selling
State secrets to other countries
four decades
if everything else is exactly why what
it looks like why would this one be
different
it looks exactly like it and you would
have to take a pro you'd need a crowbar
to pry me off that opinion
because there's no there's no
information countering it at all
now remember
individuals are innocent until proven
guilty
so the bidens as individuals innocent
until proven guilty but Joe Biden is
also the government
and the government
is guilty until proven is
so if you're going to walk around being
my president and looking guilty as
heck
it took me that was hard to pull that
one back
guilty as heck
well I'm gonna assume you are
so as of today my operating assumption
is the criminal the the president of the
United States Joe Biden is and has been
a major Criminal
and a Trader for decades
that's that's my working assumption
because all information suggested
now I'm open to
I'm open to him opening his books and
explaining how he got these homes
I'm open to you know finding out that
it's all a big lie and it's all some big
conservative conspiracy theory and uh
he doesn't even sniff girls hair that's
all just a lie so I'm open to calendar
evidence but as of now I think it's a
safe statement of fact preliminary
that were led by a major Criminal
which would explain why he's not doing
anything on the border
useful and why he's not doing anything
about Tick Tock and Fentanyl and it
would explain everything
so if it explains everything that should
be your working hypothesis
so we should all just assume it true
just assume it's true and if he wants to
prove it isn't I'm open to that
all right one of my uh
favorite things to watch on the internet
is you know you're all watching the
Crowder
the Crowder versus The Daily wire you
know where daily wire offered him a deal
but in it was uh
some Clauses to say if he got canceled
on social media
that he that they wouldn't pay him as
much money
some people called that a penalty
I called it a normal business deal in
which you're sharing Revenue
a penalty
I guess all of my contracts are
penalties
I guess my book deals a penalty because
you know what if I don't sell enough
books that publisher is not going to
give me money
can you believe it
like if I don't produce money for both
of us they won't give me my half
I know I know it's like well not half
but whatever it is but it's totally
Criminal
that if we make a deal that we'll both
make money and then we don't make any
money they're not going to pay me
bastards
wow anyway
so uh here's my favorite thing is
watching Mike serenovich
disembowel Crowder's argument at all of
his supporters
and you know he's he's the only one who
can see the whole field that's talking
about it
uh
you know because you know I'm always a
big fan of sirovich in general but you
know he's an attorney he's a business
person he's seen enough of the world
that he knows what a business deal is
supposed to look like and and he sees
this entire thing for what it is with
you know I don't think there's any
hidden hidden uh
you know like dark Corners I think he
sees the whole field and he's calling
he's calling the balls and Strikes here
it's kind of hilarious so you should
watch you should follow a certain image
anyway but you should definitely look at
his his crowded comments I'll tell you
what he's saying uh
so you know Crowder's claiming that
um big Khan as he calls it the big
conservative
groups are working with big Tech
so they're not exactly on the other side
of big Tech they're working with them
because they like to monetize you know
through big Tech so they want to keep
them on their side so his his take is
that nobody is sort of working for the
artist
who doesn't want to get banned on social
media because all the the big
conservatives are just working with the
platforms like everybody else
now where certificate asked is give some
details about he goes he goes how
people keep saying daily wires in bed
with big Tech
examples
and then he says he's not a daily wire
you know Fanboy but
can can anybody give an example of how
the daily wire is doing something with
big Tech that you wouldn't like like
what would be that now why did we have
to get to today
and why did it have to be Mike cernovich
to ask the question
uh
do you have even one example
just just one example
now maybe he does but why haven't we
heard one example up until now no
examples
self-censorship no
all right well I think it's up to uh
Crowder to give us some examples and
maybe he has them if he has them we'll
talk about it because I'd like to know
that wouldn't you
I mean if his claim if his claim holds
up
I'd certainly like to know it so give us
some examples maybe you can flip us to
your side
uh and then I guess we found out
that uh Crowder says he wasn't about the
money
and then he was asked on Tim Poole's
show
Tim cast he was asked but didn't your
agent
uh ask for more money
but it wasn't about the money but your
agent countered and asked for more money
and uh Crowder I think he acknowledged
that his agent might have but he didn't
but he didn't
so what do you think Mike cernovich said
that about that
that Crowder didn't make an offer but
his agent did
it's exactly what you think
exactly what you think all right
foreign
so
let's talk about that border crossing
I saw an Adam Shaw tweet he's a Fox News
um journalist reporter I'm not sure what
they're called These Days correspondent
Maybe
um and he says the Border numbers for
December are out this is for one month
for one month
uh the number of border crossings uh
251 000 encounters that's how many
encounters or we don't know how many
crosstons didn't get counted
that was just the number of encounters
encounters
how many do we stop
one and four does anybody know how many
we stop only one in three one in ten I
have no idea
my guess would be
one in four
like with no background information to
back that up
all right well
so that's a pretty high run rate
but again
let me remind you how Trump can win both
Republicans and Democrats on Border
issue
High Ground maneuver
you say this it's not about stopping
people coming in it's about having a
system where we can let the good ones in
and stop the stop the criminals for
example
so what we need is some independent
group
of economists
to tell us what's the right number and
mix of people to let in and let that all
be public should be a bipartisan
group you know maybe one more Republican
just because if Republicans put it
together everybody gets to have one more
person if they're in charge
um
and then make it all public
like the OMB
you know one of the most surprising
things to me is that the office
management and budgets is actually
deemed somewhat credible by both sides
am I wrong about that give me a fact
check on that
is is it a fact
that the OMB that always scores the the
federal budgets
aren't they considered credible
I mean maybe not but I always thought
they were because they work for both
Administrations
and they're I don't think that the
people the staffers I don't think
they're necessarily appointed are they
maybe just the head
the gbo or the CBO
it's a CBO all right whatever it is so
do you think that there could be a
credible permanent organization and
maybe maybe it's something that's
already in the government that would
tell us what is the number of uh
immigrants and what types and from where
to come in
because I don't think the President
should make that decision
do you any president
I don't think the President should
decide on the mix
that's that's way
that's way outside outside their strike
zone
I think economists and business people
should decide on the mix you know with
input from business how many employees
do you need that you can't get and and
you know then then also there should be
advocates for Americans right so if
you've got some kind of a group doing
that calculation you need at least
somebody in that group who's gonna say
okay but you got to consider you know
how that's going to come out of the
pockets of the poor directly or
indirectly and all that stuff
so I think Trump can take the high
ground and say let's take the president
enter the decision who comes in
let's have a tight border but take the
take the politics out of who comes in
how does that not work
I I think I think Trump just walks into
the presidency if he says that I think
you just walk right in because he if he
just says you know I'll do the president
thing of controlling the Border but
separately let's take the who gets in
out of politics and we'll create a
bipartisan group you tell me he wouldn't
get elected on that
in a heartbeat he would yeah easily he
would just walk into the office if he
said that because the the border is
where people put up the most resistance
because they they feel the dog whistle
just take the dog whistle out
because it's not something Trump needed
right he didn't need a dog whistle so
just take it out
all right
um there was a weird story about uh
Demar Hamlin
the football player who collapsed in the
field and I guess he is healthy enough
to be walking around and he attended a
game yesterday
but he wore a mask and sunglasses and a
hat
and never showed his face
so the videos of him don't show his face
so of course
of course
of course people think it's not really
him and he died
okay I'm pretty sure we would know if he
died like that would be a hard one to
keep a secret so I don't think he died I
think he might have you know more to do
with
who knows just didn't want to talk to
people or whatever it was so you may
have had some medical or other reasons
but uh are you amazed that we've got to
today and we don't we don't have a cause
for his problem
there's no official cause
may we take the standard that we have
been using up to this point today
the standard is maybe it's exactly what
it looks like what if it's exactly what
it looks like because what it looks like
is he may have been vaccinated recently
am I right
because if that were not the case I'm
sure they would have told us that right
up front
if if you were I guess they all had to
be vaccinated but but if he had been
recently vaccinated let's say recently
boosted
it's got to be that
am I right
now they're now saying it so you can
never be 100 sure but if your gut
instinct is to say well if it looks
exactly like it and they're not even
bothering to deny it that should be your
starting assumption
your starting assumption is that you got
the vaccination and fell down they don't
want to tell you am I right
now let me make a distinction
I also was debunking some of those
suddenly died athletes because a number
of them actually were video people died
before the pandemic and some of them
didn't die and they were fine they just
got up so a lot of the a lot of the
video you've seen of athletes dying a
lot of it was fake for sure but not all
of it
you know like the not all of it was
debunked but there were just some
obvious uh ones that were wrong
but this is a different situation this
is one specific person
who is you know having a public medical
situation
and is not telling you the thing you
would most want to know
did you recently get vaccinated
oh that's all you need to know
clearly that's the problem here now I'm
not saying that the vaccination injured
it
I want to be clear about that
but it's pretty clear that they're not
telling you he got vaccinated recently
and does anybody disagree
that we could conclude that with a
pretty high degree of certainty that he
was probably boosted recently
and I think probably all of them were
right don't don't all the all the
professional athletes have to get
boosted
like boosted and boosted and boosted I
think they do I think it's just required
so yeah you should assume it's exactly
what it looks like that would be a fair
assumption
all right um
so so there's an update on Russia and
Kiev by the way stay with me if you want
to see me uh admit more about things I
got wrong on the pandemic if anybody
likes me to admit I'm wrong
stick around we'll do that last
um so there's some people speculating
that uh Russia is going to mass forces
in Belarus and then attack Kiev from
there and you know destroy Kev and
declare a victory or something
does that sound like something that
might happen
do you think that's going to happen
that feels unlikely to me
yeah I'm not going to rule it out I I
think that given the winter pause will
you know it changes everything because
you don't know which side did a better
job of preparing for after the pause
so I think at this point
uh the war is a toss-up
I don't think as of today you could say
Ukraine or Russia are winning
it looks like it looks like a toss-up to
me what do you think
I think it's now in solidly
unpredictable territory
not that it was ever super predictable
admit defeat you mean that mint defeat
that Ukraine will lose
I'm always open to that
I I I've predicted that Russia would be
unsuccessful
conquering Ukraine
but if they wait long enough
I I would acknowledge that if Russia
wanted to you know risk everything and
wait long enough that they could take
Ukraine probably
yes I'll give you that
all right
um
it's a draw I think the most likely
outcome is a draw with forever fighting
in the you know some of those recently
captured areas
that's what I'm guessing
so
um
there's a new study that says that
vitamin D deficiency was found in 82
percent of covet cases
but the general population is only 47
so the vitamin D deficiency was twice as
profound
um
in the people who got covet and probably
the outcomes as well
now I would like to do a competition
and I I did a little Googling and I
couldn't determine
I feel like I am the first person in the
world
to say in public
I'm probably not so this is where you
get to debunk me so if you like to
embarrass me this is your opportunity I
believe I'm the first person in the
world
who said that the country differences
and the the demographic differences like
black people having worse time with
covet that that was a vitamin D pattern
now hold on hold on let me be specific
I'm not no I'm not the first person to
say vitamin D was important to outcomes
hear that clearly I'm definitely not the
first person or even close
to say that vitamin D was would help you
recover would you agree
that that everybody said that like
doctor said it lay people said it
early on like right away everybody said
more vitamin D so that part I'm not I'm
not claiming anything I was just one of
a million people who said the obvious
hey vitamin D is good for you all right
so I'm not making any credit taking any
credit for that I'm being very specific
I believe I'm the first person who said
it's the reason that you're getting
different outcomes in different
countries
and different outcomes across uh black
versus white Etc
I believe I'm the first
and and here's why because when it when
it occurred to me I'd never heard it so
the only thing I can know for sure is
that when it occurred to me I hadn't
heard it yet but it might be out there
so so if somebody has a source
because once I found out that Sweden um
routinely gives people Vitamin D
supplements and cod oil or something I
don't know once I realized that the the
reason that Sweden was an exception is
that they had a lot of vitamin D
and then if you ever figured out why
Africa
Africa never had a problem
is that wild
that Africa basically escaped the
pandemic without doing
much of anything
do you know what the vitamin D rate is
in Africa
really good
because they spend a lot of time outside
in the sun
it's really good so even though they're
you know mostly black so they have
tougher time absorbing on average they
spend so much time Outdoors that they
have good vitamin D now Africa is also
young and thin
right
some people said oh they have lots of
vibramectin but it's probably
you know it can't be more than 10
percent of the population
yeah I've removed in probably less than
10 percent
I I would imagine that most people in
Africa are on any kind of pharmaceutical
drug at all
yeah and I and maybe 10 for hydro
hydroxychloroquine and stuff but
um those things are definitely factors
or could be
but the the one that just jumped out
was that every group that had low
vitamin D was were the ones everybody
said was getting hit the hardest
so I put that out there that nobody made
the Country Connection
before I did
do you want anybody want to fact check
that
yeah find somebody who said in public
anybody who had a YouTube or a tweet or
something that the country difference
not and I I know you're just going to
send me people who said vitamin D D is
good do not send me
anything that just said I said vitamin D
is good
stipulated I get that we all agree with
that just the country difference I think
that was first
I think I was first in the world
actually
but could be wrong
all right
um
here's
I used to work in big corporations and
if you've worked in a big Corporation
you know there's a process that they
like to do in the big company if
something doesn't work you make a big
mistake a bad product or whatever uh
your your project fails they like to do
a postmortem to find out what they
learned right so I would like to find
out
how so many of you got the right answer
about the vaccinations
whereas I didn't
so I'm going to try to figure out and
maybe you can help me
figure out what heuristics what rules of
thumbs what what sort of common sense
but also data did you look at and one of
the things that people most complained
to me when I said
that I I was giving the win to the
unvaxed people
so I gave them the win because they
definitely got to the right place and
I'd like to learn how they did that
because I got to the wrong place because
now I have a vaccination in me but I'm
not worried about covid so now I just
have to worry about the vaccination
right so I lost
right
so having said that and be very clear
that the winners of the people who
use some different system to analyze
stuff I wanted to find out what I did
now I made the mistake of saying all the
data is unreliable
so I didn't believe the data from the
official sources
but I also didn't believe the data from
anybody who has disagreed with the
official sources
and so to me it was a data free
environment
but it was a data free environment for
many of you but a lot of people said no
Scott you're wrong there was a lot of
good data
and I've been sending a number of people
said they've been sending it to me and
I've been ignoring it so let's fix that
right wouldn't you say that was a big
mistake on my part
that there was in fact good data
it was presented to me I didn't have to
go look for it and then I discounted it
and then I made the wrong decision
because I discounted it would you agree
that's an accurate statement so we're
going to try to correct
whatever the hell is wrong with me
with your help
and there will be a little whiteboard
here so I asked people I asked people
how they did it
on Twitter this morning like how did you
do it like how did you know what was the
good data and what was the bad data I'll
give you some answers
um and then you can add some answers if
anything is left out right so here are
all my problems the things I didn't do
right
uh see James pop these are people on
Twitter who responded I said for me it
was just pragmatic how could something
so new talk about the vaccination how
could something so new be remotely ready
for human use in such a good time short
time
good that's a good starting place isn't
it
would you agree that
that's a good solid
common sense
no dispute about the facts there's
nobody who's going to question that the
vaccination was rushed relative to what
we would all expect or like right good
point and yeah sorry I I like that point
so I I responded I have a lot of respect
this I tweeted back I have a lot of
respect for the people who were smart
enough to avoid a hastily prepared
vaccination
is that fair I I do have a lot of
respect for people who were smart enough
to avoid a hastily prepared vaccination
in favor of a relatively the relative
safety of an engineered bioweapon that
escaped from the lab so the people who
were smart enough not to take the
hastily prepared vaccination and rather
you know go to the relative safety
of an unknown bioengineered weapon
made the right call
and so I'm trying to learn from them
all right I I put too much weight on an
unknown bioengineered virus that looked
like it might have been a weapon of mass
destruction
with God knows what kind of future
impact but I put a little too much
emphasis on that whereas I should have
been focusing more on the fact that the
uh and I knew this I knew the
vaccination was not tested as much as
others
all right so
um then there were people who send me
good data and I kept saying
but how did I know it was good
you see the problem because people were
saying I have the good data and I send
it to you and I saw it in many cases I
saw it but how was I supposed to
determine
that that was the good data and so I
asked people how did you know because I
couldn't tell to me it all looked
sketchy like it all looked bad I didn't
see any good data nothing that I trusted
but other people did and they say they
could sort out the good data from the
bad so I was asking how they did that
and
here's some more answers on that
[Applause]
um here here's how some people did it
um some people said you should trust the
people who were banned
that that's like a flag of credibility
that the people who are banned
were more credible than the people who
are not banned and
you know I'm not trying to live in the
past I'm trying I'm trying to prepare
for the next you know the next situation
so
I wondered if that's a standard we could
always use
was that a standard that only worked for
that one pandemic
or would it be true for the next one and
I'm not aware of all the people who got
banned but is the argument that
everybody who got banned had the right
answer
was there anybody who got banned who had
the wrong answer
or was it only it was Banning like a
really good signal for the right person
what do you say well if you had to put a
percentage on it
is and let's say for the next situation
forget about the pandemic for the next
situation whatever that is
should I should I say if they're if
you're banned you're like 80 likely to
be right
and the people who are saying things
that don't get them banned
are most likely to be wrong or lie
about 80 percent
what would you say well 25 doesn't help
me because if they're only 20 25 likely
why are you believing them
I mean it's got to be over it's got like
80 90 right all right so we're getting
some 80s and some 90s all right good
so
so I'm seeing some agreement that you
can uh see what data has been banned and
also what people
so that falls for people as well right
the people who were banned
were very much most likely to be right
and you could tell because they were
banned is that right
you could tell they're the good ones
because they're banned right okay
so I'll look more to band people next
time as opposed to people who
say things that don't get them banned
um
and then other people said they're just
some people you can trust more
it's more about trusting the right
people
so you know I acknowledge my weakness
that I can't tell the difference between
good data and bad because it all looks
bad to me
so if I can't tell what data is good
then I could rely on what people are
good right
because they're reliable people
are most likely to have the reliable
data that makes sense so the people who
were you know banned and ostracized the
Alex berensons and Brett Weinstein and
uh let's see a fat Emperor and bori
quagato and some other people
uh
so those are the ones we trusted so
rather than trusting the medical
professionals a lot of people said I'm
going to trust a journalist
now does that always work
or did it only just work on this
pandemic so the people who trust a
journalist
Berenson over let's say the the bulk of
the medical community and we know
Berenson got the right answer so
obviously he knows something they didn't
but here's the question
will the journalist who disagrees with
the medical community generally be right
or only if they're also banned
are they only right if they're banned
so what what if it's a journalist who
disagrees with the mainstream
but is not banned
are they still more likely to be right
and what if there are two journalists
and one says the mainstream is wrong and
one says it right because two
journalists would be roughly equal in
credibility right
so how would you sort that out
because you have one journalist who's on
one side but another journalist who's on
another and since journalists are better
than medical professionals at medical
stuff so we could ignore the medical
people but which of the journalists
would I pick
the banned one right
the one so so somebody like a Doctor
Drew
who did not get banned I should sort of
minimize his influence
and look for the people who are the most
most banned
to get my credibility
does that make sense
I'm looking for your guidance all right
here's some other things that people
said
um
will say
uh some people said that the data that
they were hiding tells you everything
you need to know
and I thought oh that's pretty
insightful because if the it once it's
once you can tell that somebody's hiding
some data
or that there's a lack of data
the lack of data tells you more than the
actual data
you good with that
does that make sense the data that you
don't have
is telling you more than the data you
have
right I mean that's a pretty big signal
if they're going to hide that data so
I'm wondering in general
again because I'm I'm not living in the
past trying to prepare for the next one
in general should I use the lack of data
to make my decisions versus the data
should I go with the the non-information
to base my decisions up
all right
um
and then let's say
um
then somebody was ostracizing me or
criticizing me not ostracizing
um saying that I gave you two pretty
clear examples of how to do it one you
want well credentialed peer-reviewed
people prior to covet
so do you do you agree with that you
should believe the people who are well
credentialed and peer-reviewed even
before covet
that makes sense doesn't it believe the
people because like Dr McCullough Dr
Malone
peer-reviewed very credible so you
should believe them
but what happens if what happens if the
people on the other side are also
credentialed and peer-reviewed
do I so if they're all credentialed and
peer-reviewed but they have different
opinions
should I take the ones that are in the
extreme minority
because the the minority is usually
right on medical stuff
or should I use that as the base
the base and just say all right but
which one's more banned
so if they have equal credentials
I should favor the one that's banned
right
next time
all right
um also the people who risked livelihood
basically they put their careers on the
line
so I should trust the people who who
knew they were going to lose money in
this right
because they don't have a financial
incentive
so that would be like Dr McCullough Dr
Malone because they they risked their
careers
didn't they
so that does make you more credible if
you're willing to you know put some skin
in the game
so Dr McCullough for example definitely
put some risk on his medical future
we can only hope that he makes his money
back on his book
because he did he did do a book probably
does some speaking tours so uh Dr Malone
has a book
and Brett Weinstein has a podcast I
think it's monetized but you don't want
to look at any of those people because
they put their entire Financial
Futures on the line
and all they got out of it was
best-selling books and top rated
podcasts that are monetized so that's a
that's a that's a group you want to
believe in because they're not
influenced by money in any way
so that was a good
good idea
um
then also
all right what else uh I had some other
oh oh this is important you should not
you don't trust any study
where the people running the study
were funded by you know like big Pharma
or somebody wants to make money from it
you'd agree with that right you can't
trust any study that somebody's got a
money motivation
but here's here's my issue
and I know you can do this because you
did it but I did it wrong so you're
gonna have to teach me how to do this
there are some there are some studies
where you can tell who funded it
and so I would be with you and say oh if
it was funded by those people you can't
trust it
but what happens if it's a study where
you don't know if it was funded or
here's the tough part
what if let's say there's a Doctor Who's
the head head person of the study
and that doctor did not get money from
any big Pharma
but the doctor does a lot of speaking
engagements
for big Pharma and let's say somebody
who's you know close to the decision
that we're trying to make
would you know that would you know if a
doctor who led a study that was not
funded by big Pharma but would you know
if the doctor individually and privately
gave a highly paid talks as seminars
paid for by the same company that he's
doing the research for would you know
that
I don't think you would I mean I
wouldn't so you have to teach me how you
know that because I wouldn't it's my
understanding that everybody's working
for money but apparently some people are
not all right so I put it all together
on a whiteboard so I could try to
understand how you made the decision
correctly
it looks like this
um I was using bad data and other people
were using good data and they could tell
the difference
so the best data is stuff that's banned
and the best experts are the ones who
who risked it all and were unpaid
unpaid except for their best-selling
books and podcasts
and then this was the important part
because I got this because I asked
people okay if you do all this
how do you know the data is right
like ultimately how do you know data is
right and the best answer I got is that
somebody compared it to what they
already knew
and when you compare it to what you
already know
um
you you do your own assessment so you
don't just trust the data I was told you
do your own assessment of whether it
looks reasonable
now
a day ago I would have said this is
confirmation bias and that it just looks
like people had confirmation bias and
they worked backwards to who the right
data was and who the experts are that
was my old model of the world
but since this process got to the right
answer
I have to revise that and apologize
because I was in wrong
I'm being told that there's a different
doctor who's more credible
somebody called Dr Lee now I don't know
anything about Dr Lee
but I'm sure he's not writing a book or
monetizing his his opinion anyway just
like the other experts although they did
write best selling books and and
probably doing speaking engagements and
are very very famous people now but they
didn't have any monetary
no no monetary interest just books and
podcasts and stuff uh which are probably
paying more than their medical medical
stuff but um so this used to be
confirmation bias but now I know this is
actually just a you know Common Sense
kind of approach so then uh the last
step is the part that I was totally
wrong about
this is the part where I really screwed
up
um
but so once you've got your good data
and your good experts which you can tell
because you're comparing it to your own
assessment of the data and the experts
um so you know that's good because it's
all compatible
then you you take that because that's
just your assessment on one side that's
just the vaccine and you compare it to
the unknown risk of a bioengineered
weapon of mass destruction and it's
obvious that this is a bigger risk
so
so this is as close as I can get to
trying to
improve my game and I think what
happened was ultimately I got lost in
the weeds
I was I was on the weeds I you know I
couldn't see the trees for the forest
kind of thing but it was all kind of
obvious if I just go and use the good
data with the good experts
and it's easy to tell who the good ones
are because they're banned
and then just use my own assessment to
decide what was the good date of the
good experts and then compare it to the
unknown risk of a bioengineered weapon
of mass destruction and I could have
gotten the right answer too
during the fog of War
and on top of that one thing I was also
getting wrong was certainty
I I kept I kept like being on the fence
I don't know if I got a lot of criticism
for that because I was like I'm on the
fence I don't know which is the bigger
risk I I don't know is it the the
vaccine or the virus I don't know so I
was like all over the place
and I can't apologize enough for that
you know I'm sorry
that I misled you
and I was totally wrong
the unvaccinated were the winners they
got the right answer from the start and
impressively they got it with heuristics
which beat the heck out of my poor
analytical abilities and you have my
respect for that
all right I don't understand this
comment my inability to be wrong
how much more can I agree with you
you won't take yes for an answer
why can't you take yes for an answer
I'm literally telling you you got the
right answer
and I'm accepting I'm accepting your
analysis
what's the problem
seriously what's the problem
no no no uh I may have misled you
somebody says was I certain it was a bio
weapon now let me be clear I didn't know
what the virus was
I also didn't know what the so-called
vaccination was
I didn't know what either one of them so
I I was a complete unknown I should have
listened to
I should have listened to the good
experts
who knew from the start what the virus
was and what the vaccination was and I
should have known who the good experts
were because I should have used my own
assessment
and like like you say there were a lot
of you who were right from the start
and I certainly wasn't
would you agree with that statement
there are a lot of you
who through this
improved
let's say
sort of a model for understanding the
world
and now we want tribunals yeah I think
the people who did not use this method
probably need jail time
would you agree I'm wondering if I
should go to jail do you know how many
people I probably killed with my
analyzes
let me think I have to live with that
for the rest of my life
those of you who
um
were the Smart Ones
you know you don't you have you have
clean conscience
now I used to worry about all the people
who were you know use this analysis and
then uh died of covid because they were
unvaccinated but
and that actually was one of my biggest
decision-making criteria
because I was under the mistaken
impression that there was like some
coven pandemic that swept through the
country and recently I'm learning that
nobody died
so I mean I thought I was believing the
government the government
idiot
I don't know how dumb I could be I
believe in the government that people
were dying of covet and and the
government was saying that the
unvaccinated were dying at a much higher
rate
and now we know that that was all made
up
because all data is made up except for
this
if I'd known the good Experts of the
good data I wouldn't have made that
mistake that's for sure
all right so next time I'm going to try
harder
to use my own assessment
to know what the good data is and who
the good experts are and I won't be
making that mistake again of distrusting
all of the data
I'm getting there yeah
so
I'm getting I'm getting a lot of support
on the YouTube platform from people who
say finally
finally you're understanding what's
going on
all right
well thank you very much I'm going to
say goodbye to YouTube and talk to the
people and locals whoops we've got a
little problem here
talk to the people on locals and I will
see you tomorrow bye for now
