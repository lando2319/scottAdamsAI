moving over here all right that's
perfect
that's perfect well i'm a little bit
late
a little bit late but am i stopped
no i was on the other side of the island
that's santorini doing a little uh
shopping a little lunch
and my internet connection died and i
couldn't get it back
but now but now
it's all coming together isn't it the
best time of the day
slightly delayed but
still here and suppose you wanted to
enjoy it to its
maximum extent what would that take yeah
that's right
what you need would be a copper a mug or
glass a tanker
stein a canteen jacket flask a vessel of
any kind
fill with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better
oh rhonda you're so nice it's called the
simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen now
oh yeah this is so good
so good well i might be a little bit
unprepared today
because this this vacation thing is very
uh
it's addictive i don't know if you've
ever taken a vacation
i'm not big on them but lately i've been
trying to
get into this whole vacationy thing and
i've always had this
theory that if i took a vacation well
maybe it's more of a more of a fear or a
phobia than a
than a theory that if i took too much
time off
i would never be able to do my job again
because if you're a cartoonist there's a
very
thin line between something that
you know really makes an impact and
something that people just go yeah well
yeah that was nice and i feel that extra
five percent
is the difference between you know
something that works and something that
doesn't
and i feel like i lose five percent if i
take a vacation
so i've always thought i try to build a
life
where the vacation is already built into
the life
meaning that every day i've got a whole
bunch of good things happening
but i worked also and that's why i work
seven days a week
because i don't like to take a day off i
think if i take a day off i won't be as
sharp
when i come back and by the way it's
true you know it's not
it's not based on nonsense i actually do
lose some sharpness
if i don't do something pretty active
every day
and uh i feel as though i'm pushing back
age because you've noticed that i
i do uh i do a lot of tight rope walking
on a lot of different topics and
do a lot of different stuff and i think
the that effect of it is
keeps my brain a little bit younger at
least that's what i'm telling myself
so why don't we look at what's happening
i'm not sure this is like a a big old
news day
but let's see if there's anything
interesting all right so let's see we've
got
a couple stories
uh tom cotton is getting on apple
for uh i guess they were lobbying
against an anti-slavery bill
in china must been a bill uh condemning
i don't know condemning china for the
uyghur holocaust that's going on there
um and
so i guess apple was against uh the
antitrust
so against anything that's against the
big platforms but also against
anti-slavery bills so
that's not a good look uh did you see
the video of the
uh chinese fellow
he was talking about the wuhan lab and
he says that the wuhan lab should be
given the
the the nobel prize in medicine because
they
i guess they sequenced or found the
coronavirus first
hmm yes uh
the wuhan lab did find the coronavirus
first
that's probably a fact ah but
i don't know if that's quite nobel prize
material because they may have caused it
how many people think that the virus was
natural in the comments show me how many
think it was natural
just just coincidentally as jon stewart
famously said that it came when a bat
kissed a turtle is there anybody left
who believes that
now check your this is another one of
those prediction
situations and i always tell you that if
you've made a prediction
keep track see how good you are might
give you some humility
or it might make you feel good if you're
really good at predicting i'm not sure
anybody's really good at predicting
we don't live in a predictable world uh
but if i recall and maybe you can
fact-check me on this
i'm pretty sure my first statements
about this were
that's a mighty big coincidence you know
but maybe
maybe but it's a mighty big coincidence
that that lab is there
um and i will tell you that you know in
a in a non-public way
uh i saw some information early that
would suggest
it was definitely lab but
that's stuff that you all know at this
point
yes i did see the john stewart clip and
it was
hilarious we we miss him he needs to
come back
all right um so this is kind of funny
elon musk
tweeted a picture of two of his rockets
i guess getting staged for liftoff and
have you seen these things his rockets
because they don't look like you know
the old kind of rockets they're they're
kind of fatter and they're
all metal like a you know a proper
sci-fi movie uh should be and
they they don't even look real because
they're so big
that it doesn't your brain can't say no
there can't be something that big
that looks like that it could either
look like that and be small
or it could be really big but it
wouldn't look like that but somehow he
made it
look like that and really big
but here's the the funny thing i
realized
in all likelihood elon musk will put
a man on mars would you agree
i mean he's young enough he's doing all
the right stuff
there's gonna be some mishaps and he
said the same thing
but i think he's young enough that he's
gonna put somebody on mars
and here's the funny part it will be one
of the greatest
human achievements you know where
fingers crossed everybody's rooting for
him
it's one of the few things probably
everybody's in favor of right
there's nobody who doesn't want to put a
person on mars
let's let's not say a man on mars okay
let's say a person on mars
and when that happens
30 percent of the public will think it
was staged in a studio
now how would that feel if you were just
you know
thinking forward and imagine that elon
actually managed to
put somebody on mars i think it's going
to happen
30 percent of the world will say that
didn't happen yeah now that
that's just photoshop and clever editing
and
yeah that was probably in arizona
yeah so
uh i guess joy reid
thinks that people don't want to teach
critical race theory in schools
because they don't want children to know
the accurate history of this country
what is there anybody in the world
who doesn't want uh children to learn
the accurate history of the
of the country including slavery of
course
you know what certainly you could argue
one of the two or three most important
things in the country
you know depending on how you want to
measure things or
there's a pretty good argument it's the
number one most important thing
that sort of defines us where we are at
this moment
you know i guess the revolutionary war
would be you know
maybe number one but uh
do you think there are people you i
think
joel pollock made this point in a tweet
do you think there's even
one person who fits the description
of somebody who wants to get rid of
critical race theory
because they don't want accurate history
taught to children
most of our politics is about imaginary
people
have you noticed that it's about things
that people
might do in the future but you don't
know so
those are imaginary people because the
future is imaginary right
until it happens it's imaginary then
you've got your fake
news about the things that people were
doing
that didn't really happen so you got
imaginary people in the past
you got imaginary people in the future
because that's the only kind you have
and then you have the present where you
have our
political pundits describing people who
don't exist
not even any one person and then making
an entire impassioned
plea criticizing those imaginary people
most of politics is imaginary people
oh don't get me started about
about the election integrity which was
perfect by the way
in case anybody's watching
it was perfect there were no
irregularities
i've ever met as bad ivermectin is bad
all right you never know who's listening
really
um so let's see what else is going on
here
well we've got uh
oh this it was don lemon who said that
i'm sorry i
had my stories wrong it was don lemon
who uh
said that we're trying to white wash
racism and not teach
teach it in schools so i got that story
wrong this is what happens when you're
not prepared
so matt gates shared some threatening
texts
that were going to people he knows and
apparently
some reporters or at least one in
particular is getting pretty aggressive
about sort of subtly
i don't want to use the word threaten
but let's say
rattle the cage put a little
psychological pressure on them
to come up with some dirt on matt gates
and what a world we live in
the people who don't have dirt are being
pressured to come up with some or else
they'll be in trouble with the press
the press is a little bit too strong
isn't it
so that's pretty cringy
let's take a look at what's happening
over on fox news
i looked at cnn and nothing's happening
over there they didn't
see an independent news today that
the most interesting thing uh in the
news today is
that guy who got swallowed by a whale
and then and then
spit back out and he was okay there were
some doubts
about whether that was a real story i
don't know
i'm not going to start a religion around
it
but i'm close i mean he did get
swallowed by a giant whale
and he did get spit out apparently
apparently he did get spit out
and lived so i
might start a religion around that you
know i'm pro-religion i just don't have
one
so we need a we need one that i can
i can enjoy now
uh apparently fauci admitted that
scientists acknowledged the coven 19
could be lab invented illness in early
2020
but didn't everybody i feel like
everybody knew it could have been
didn't they or you know i don't i don't
think it ever got ruled out in any kind
of
you know rigorous way
yeah since since my live stream today is
is frankly terrible because i'm not
prepared i'm glad that you're stepping
up in the comments
so if you replay this you might want to
turn on the comments so you can see the
way they happened
wow so the democrats are really all
in on this critical race theory and
i'm a little bit glad about it are you
is there anybody here who thinks
critical race theory
is uh going to be a problem
you know what's going to happen right
the people who might have taken their
kids out of public school and
put them in a private school is always a
reasonably big number
but the number of people who will do it
if critical race theory becomes
uh part of the public school curriculum
people are going to be desperate people
are going to cash in their
their iras and their you know seps and
stuff
i feel like people are going to open
their wallets to get their kids
out of a public school if they're if
they're teaching racism
teaching kids to be racist i think i'd
pull my kid out of there
right away uh and i don't know what's
happening in california on that but
um yeah i think it's going to spark a
homeschool
surge then maybe the the genie can never
be put back in the bottle
the teachers unions have figured out how
to do everything wrong
it's it's like the teachers unions
either feel they have too much power
as they can do anything they want or
they don't know that they're
they're getting ready for their own
demise by by just
going too far basically just going too
far
of course biden revealed the 16 most
valuable infrastructure
targets for putin and said
please don't attack these things these
are our most important ones
i honestly can't think of anything more
lame than that
you know on one hand it does kind of
make sense
that you know we have certain things
that we say okay if you if you attack
these things
it's basically war so maybe that would
have been a better way to say it
let me put it this way if if we think
that russia attacks any of our
top infrastructure and let's say you
name
all 16 you could say that is equivalent
to an armed conflict
because they would be that important to
the integrity of the country
now if he told them that that wouldn't
be bad
right here are 16 things which will
cause a shooting war
as far as you know and maybe we wouldn't
but we say if you touch any one of these
things and we find your fingerprints on
them
that's a real war that's not playing
around anymore
these 16 are real war just know that
there's no ambiguity it's just like a
nuclear attack
these 16 real war and and every
every weapon is in play now
realistically we're not gonna
you know start bombing russia but we
might get pretty darn aggressive
and aggressive could take many forms and
it could take some pretty bad ones
so who knows but if it
if there was a good threat behind it
maybe it wasn't as bad as it looks
i'm just reading the headlines here at
fox did biden actually start to call
putin president trump
he probably did but again
how many of you have said president
and then you were going to say some
other president and you ended up saying
not trump because he's
just you know in your head all the time
here's a question for you how important
is january 6th to democrats
it's really important and here's why
think about the uh the biggest
complaint about trump that
felt somewhat real right now he was
always
called the racist blah blah blah but
um we didn't see you know anything that
looked like
rounding up anybody for concentration
camps
so it didn't get nearly as bad as what
anybody thought and
actually he was pro-lgbtq
pro-black americans he just got branded
the other way
but the biggest issue with trump i would
say
is that people said he wasn't honest
that he lied
wouldn't you say biden made a big deal
about that
that and the imaginary people
the the fine people hoax so
you know biden biden's entire reason for
running
was trump doesn't tell the truth and
then
some things he imagined that happened
that didn't so what if
we realized that trump had failed the
fact
checking for four years straight which
even his supporters would say oh yeah he
did fail some fact checking
but what if none of it mattered
what if it was just one of the things
that made him more interesting
because trump had this weird quality
which is that he was the best promise
keeper we've ever seen
right when he said he would do something
he tried like hell to do it now you
could argue he didn't get the wall done
that would be fair but did he try like
hell
to do it yeah like he tried like hell
still trying
he's still running for president as far
as we can tell right he hasn't given up
yet
so did he do what he promised to do
he tried like hell and he did he got a
lot of it done
all right so i don't think anybody's
ever been more
faithful to the voters period i don't
think anybody's been close
but part of his style is the hyperbole
the exaggeration the salesmanship
you know all that and in that realm he
didn't really care too much about the
facts
we assume because he didn't didn't seem
to adhere to them in any rigorous
fashion
but what did it matter name something
that made a difference
january 6th right if they didn't have
january 6
literally the last thing that happened
they didn't have one example unless
somebody can come up with one
i'd like to be proven wrong about this
point i don't think anybody could have
come up with an example
after four years of allegedly lying
that any of it mattered except wait for
it
here's the payoff none of that lying
mattered except
it's what made him so interesting that
everybody else disappeared
as a technique it was great
it bothered you and that's why you
watched him
you thought he might lie again that's
why you watched him
we he said it was an actual lie or just
an exaggeration or
maybe he was true in a way and it was
interesting
he he has a a talent for being
interesting
and he seems to favor that over the
niceties that other people would think
would be
more important and he just stays the
most interesting person in the world
literally the most interesting person in
the world
and it helps him politically gives him
all kinds of power
so if they didn't have january 6 and say
trump you lied about the election the
big lie
right notice that the big lie is branded
the big lie
it's not branded i don't know you could
come up with 100 different
labels for it but it's the big lie
because they finally found something
they could sell
as a consequence of his lying
or let's say not passing the
fact-checking
if they didn't have january 6 they
wouldn't have
one example unless and again if i'm
wrong
if you can give me another example of
where it might have mattered
that he said something that wasn't
technically true i don't think he could
come up with one
and the big lie
we don't know if he's wrong yet we don't
know
my understanding is the arizona audit
has some surprises for you
so one of the insiders for the arizona
audit
says that we're going to see something
that will be interesting don't know what
that is
and i'm gonna bet against it changing
the election
uh i think that's an easy bet but it
might be interesting
and it might tell us something we didn't
know and it might
might change your idea of who is right
and who is wrong but we're going to hold
off on that
my guess is there's not much there so
if you want my prediction i don't think
the audit is going to find enough
to overturn an election and even if it
found a lot
it wouldn't overturn the election you
know it's too it's too late
um but that's
that's uh where that's at all right
um i guess kamalaro still hasn't been to
the border
somebody said that trump was going to go
to the border is that is that true
is that still on um
he said siri used chemical weapons on
his own people
did it matter
yeah the the question is whether any of
it mattered
i'm not i'm not telling you that he
passed the fact-checking all the time
yeah we all agree on that point
um oh yes so he's going there he was
invited by governor abbott
well i do love the republican governors
uh you know taking it up in arizona and
i guess texas and florida is going to be
helping those guys
so that means everybody's going to come
to my state
so arrange your plans people i guess
california is where they're all coming
california is getting ready to catch on
fire
it's 100 degrees air conditioning is
breaking everywhere
and the kindling in our forests is
getting ready to
blow up so do you feel the things are
poorly managed when we have a zillion
people not working and nobody's cleaning
up the
you know the low brush and debris that's
in the forest
i feel like we got the labor to do that
uh yeah we got fires we got no water
all right so um
all right that's about all i got because
there's not much happening in the news
does anybody have anything interesting
let me give you a while you're typing
let me give you a little update on masks
in greece
where i am so i'm in santorini it's a
total
touristy place so their economy pretty
much
is just based on tourists check out
henry george's work
land value tax hmm interesting never
heard of that
here's what you need to know so the
the law in greek is that over here you
have to wear a mask
um and i think uh anywhere there are
people
or something but the locals
were very massed up and at the hotel i'm
at they're they're all matt
completely masked but we went to a
neighboring town
and uh the rules are quite different
there were close to zero
tourists wearing masks and when you went
into
any of the many many shops
nobody asked me to put a mask on oh
actually once only one shop asked me to
put a mask on
and you know i'm in their country so i
put a mask on right
if it were america depending on the
situation i might push back
but uh it's their country so i'm gonna
you know i'm not gonna be that guy
um so here's the thing you can learn
from it
and i've said this before in an
emergency
when the emergency starts the
government's in charge
and you kind of want that because you
don't want everybody just running around
and trying to do their own thing but
once the emergency
reaches the you know the end zone and
we're getting close to the end of this
pandemic fingers crossed the government
isn't the right
engine for that it's got to be the
people and the people will express their
will through
economics and let me tell you there was
not
one shopkeeper in
in this island who wanted to lose a sale
after being closed for however long
they've been closed they've been
basically starving to death here
i don't know if it's literally starving
but they've been struggling
and they were not going to lose the sale
no
no small business here was gonna turn a
tourist away if you had a wallet
you could shop and i think that's the
lesson
the lesson is economics will become the
new government right the laws of
economics
will determine what's open and when
thank you derek that is beyond generous
i appreciate that
um
oh yeah the the uh tucker carlson
question about why were there so many
fbi
agents seemingly connected to various
domestic terror problems well it makes
sense that they would be penetrated
so it always makes sense that they would
be around that
ryan that's a good idea a closing
simultaneous app
something that just
brings it all together um
dr funk juice i i just noticed that you
sent me a message
but i didn't open it yet i'm gonna open
it right now while you're watching
send me a link uh
oh a story about okay i won't read this
out loud
it's great and happy birthday hey
everybody say
uh happy birthday to dr funk juice who's
in the house
uh happy birthday to you 33 years old
and we appreciate you greatly so i would
like to dedicate this
closing simultaneous sip
to dr funk juice whose birthday is today
and the good doctor funk juice happy
birthday to you
good stuff um yes uh some of you know i
did catch up with dr
drew and his wife and christine and i
had a lovely time with them
and uh it was just insanely fun
just hanging out eating and chatting and
uh they are so interesting it's just
crazy
all right i don't think i've got
anything else left for you anybody else
got anything
sometimes it's just fun to catch up
tomorrow maybe i'll actually have some
content
but kind of depends on the news right
news has to step up
um
mike says i changed your life how did i
do that mike
you know one of the uh one of the
strange elements of what i do at this
part of my life
is that you have sort of the spider-man
problem
that with you know with power comes
responsibility
and uh when people tell me that i've
changed their lives which i hear every
day by the way
literally every day not a joke every day
somebody messaged miss me or tweets and
says you know i lost 40 pounds i got a
new job i doubled my income
and most of them are accrediting me
for usually my book kind of failed
almost everything and still win bank
and it's kind of a
it's great but it's also
a prison
but one that i would willingly go into
meaning that
if you can help people and you don't
how do you live with that right like
if people are telling me that i've made
a difference in their life in fairly
large numbers
how do i how do i stop doing that right
i mean there's
my i can't even imagine that i could
stop
trying to be helpful anyway whether i'm
successful or not
all right
thanks luz uh juneteenth what do you
think about uh
congress voting itself a paid holiday
what have i told you about selfishness
i gave a little lesson on this in the
locals
platform if you were to just assume that
the only variable you needed to look at
was
personal selfishness how often would it
predict what will happen next
just about all the time and you're going
to say to yourself
but wait there are all kinds of other
variables and
some people are good people they're not
all acting selfish they're thinking
about other people
sure that's true but what predicts best
and what predicts best as people do
what's good for themselves
consistently you know about a hundred
percent of the time maybe because
they might have a different difference
in opinion of
what's good for them maybe it's not
obvious to you but it's pretty
predictable
and when i heard that congress was going
to vote on whether
congress would get a day off with pay
with everybody else who would get the
day off i think government
employees what were the odds that
government employees would not
vote for a paid holiday for themselves
pretty low right i think it was
unanimous unanimous consent or something
so you didn't have to wonder where that
was going to go
and and who exactly wanted to be on
record opposing it
right there were some people on record
opposing it
i think
no i may be confusing two different
things if it was unanimous consent there
wasn't anybody on record
so i think i'm confusing two different
stories
uh i have not seen a hbo show called the
leftovers
all right just looking at your comments
here
because i just enjoy hanging out with
you
do i think andrew yang has a chance well
i don't know what the
polls are doing and i did not understand
he was at the top
um isn't there uh ex-police chief
i think there's a black guy who was a
police chief
so it's sort of the perfect demographic
right if you were going to say to
yourself
invent the perfect candidate for new
york city
right now it would be a black
ex-police chief that would be your
perfect
new york city candidate so i wouldn't be
surprised if he wins
but to answer your question directly
andrew yang has a lot of capability
he has all the capability you need for
pretty much any high level
job but he has to get elected first
okay just i just read your comment but i
didn't know what to say about it
have you heard about the portland police
resigning yeah well they resigned
from the uh i guess the task force or
whatever it is that was working
on the protests but they didn't lose
their jobs they
just got reassigned but that was
pretty gutsy so i guess they're
one of their members was charged with
something
and they did not think that was
appropriate and the
all 50 of them just quit at least from
the task force only
so that's a pretty good statement
eric adams is the name of the new york
city police chief candidate
well with a name like that
he's halfway elected thanks ian
you are too nice is the hotel tracking
me
uh-huh good question um
i can tell you that the hotel is is the
hotel is definitely tracking christina
because she's uh she's instagrammed some
photos so i know they're tracking her
i don't know if the hotel has figured
out who i am yet
the one of the great things about my job
back before i was doing the live
streaming stuff and the political stuff
i was famous-ish for dilbert but people
would not necessarily recognize me so
wherever i went
i could be famous and anonymous at the
same time
but when i travel with christina
everybody who sees her thinks she's
famous because you look at her you go oh
you're probably
doing something famous you know people
who look like you are always famous
and they don't look at me i could be in
a crowd of a thousand people
and if christina is next to me i'm
invisible
you know what i mean right yeah i'm not
i'm not being humble
it's just a fact i'm literally i just
disappear so i'm like the invisible man
you're walking down the street and
people are bumping into me because they
didn't even see that i'm here
so uh i feel as if
uh i'm quite anonymous at the moment
yeah i'm the hollow man
so between that and sunglasses that's
all i need
nobody knows who i am
uh audrey wants that ability
well you have to get a christina doesn't
it doesn't happen on its own
can you show us her picture um just go
to uh
instagram or just google it
and just google christina with a k
last name basham b as in boy
a-s-h-m-a-n and she'll be the first one
that pops up
um oh this there's a story about a china
defector
which i don't believe so that's one
that at least the smart people say maybe
but apparently one of the common things
to do
to mess with another country a rival
country is start a rumor that
one of their high-level people is
defecting if you wanted to mess with
china
what would be a really good way to do it
figure out who one of their
important people is and then start a
rumor that he's
he's prepping to defect and then china
has to kill them
kill that guy themselves so i think you
can get countries to jail or kill
their own people if you can successfully
start a rumor that that person is
getting ready to be a traitor
so when you hear that a high level
person is going to defect
your first thought should be
probably not if it happens it happens
and i change my mind
but just in terms of uh the odds
if you're going to play the odds don't
you think there would be far more rumors
of high level of defections because you
would you would do that as much as you
wanted right
because it works
um oh i just uh yeah right i just
misspelled christina's name you're right
b-a-s-h-a-m
sorry it's funny when i was doing it i
felt like there was an extra letter in
there
as i was saying it but it wasn't until i
saw your comment that i was like okay
that was an extra letter
let's get that in there
the fentanyl boss is defecting i don't
know if he was the boss of the fentanyl
stuff
but if he was the boss of the fentanyl
stuff we could kill him where he stands
and we would be totally justified that
in in country we could kill him in china
and i think that would be completely
justified
active war but justified
thanks sean appreciate it
um and how many of you just
googled her i know you did
our intelligence agencies don't seem
concerned about foreign adversaries
well we don't know how
we don't know a concern there
yeah i don't think the i don't think the
high level defector is really defecting
i think that's a rumor
at least if you play the odds it would
be a rumor but you know
20 maybe let's say 10 20 chance is true
would be pretty exciting i don't think
it's going to change anything
all right why don't i buy a yacht and go
around the world somebody says that's
not
really my thing not a young kind of guy
will your apple podcast ever return
interesting you would ask that because
they never went anywhere
so the last time somebody said where
where is your podcast on apple
uh we just looked and it was there
so i feel as if there might have been a
counterfeit one
that maybe got taken off so
look for a real coffee with scott adams
i think that's the name of it on the
podcast
and it's there
yeah and dax is telling you he listens
to it so i'm pretty sure it's uh
yeah look for real coffee with scott
adams
the real part if that's missing i think
you end up going to a counterfeit
site nikki haley supports the
charlottesville hoax
oh so disappointing
so disappointing um
michael asks did i realize when starting
dilbert that it was funny even to kids
with no corporate working experience
that applied to anyone who had any
exposure to an organization
well i found that out fairly quickly
because a lot of kids would email me and
or parents would say
my kid likes it but it isn't every kid
it's the smart ones if you find a kid
who reads dilbert and is a dilbert fan
they're the smart ones
in the class they're they're the ones
who are getting the good grades
very consistently so there's there's
something about
the comic that appeals to a certain type
of person regardless of age
email wasn't around then yes but um
around 93 is when i started using email
and that was yeah several years after i
started you were correct
it's funny i've been doing this for over
30 years the cartooning
so five years seems like the beginning
but that's a good correction
uh did i ever hear of mafalda i don't
know what that is
joshua says i wrote to you when i was 10
i probably read that
should people who had kovit get
vaccinated you ask well that's a
personal medical decision
so i would not try to influence you on
that i would just say that smart people
do
smart people do so that doesn't mean
it's right for you
but there are people who've looked into
it and said well i want the convenience
of saying that i'm vaccinated
it's easier to prove that than it is to
prove my antibodies maybe
so just for practical purposes
people are doing it
all right i think we've said everything
we need to say today and i think i'm
going to close this with a closing
simultaneous sip get your cup or your
mug
go
ah that's good stuff now we'll talk to
you tomorrow
