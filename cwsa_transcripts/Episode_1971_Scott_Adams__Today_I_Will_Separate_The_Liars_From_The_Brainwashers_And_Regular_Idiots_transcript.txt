good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams
and uh there's never been a finer
situation yeah and you either lucked
into it some of you
others have been strategically planning
for this moment for I don't know how
long but thank goodness you made it and
we're going to kick off
the Lesser swearing version of the of
the live stream
everybody on board with that
I might say fudge
or frickin that's as far as I'll go
I'll go all the way to frickin but then
I'm pulling back pulling back
well if you'd like to take your
experience up a notch and I think you
would I think you would all you need is
a copper amug or a glass of tanker
Chelsea's dinette candy juggar flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine here the day the thing that
makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous but it happens now go
ah
well which of the f word substitutes do
you like best fudge friggin freaking or
fracking
we can throw a little uh fracking in
there
well you've got lots of opinions on this
one wow
uh looks like well it's it's all over
the place the Battle Star Galactica
fracking seems to be
doing well
all right well maybe I'll uh
I might you know
try some of those I'll take some of
those for a spin today
okay
well the first freaking story
no no
I'll work on that
all right I have a uh a media
recommendation
have you all been wondering
Scott can you please tell us what you
would personally like to watch on the
television set and then maybe I would
like to watch it too
don't laugh
don't laugh
Glass Onion on Netflix
so I guess it's a movie Glass Onion
now here's why I recommend it
I've been railing for years about
everything that's wrong with movies this
one didn't do anything wrong no hold on
I've only watched the first third of it
I've only watched the first third
already I recommend it right I'll watch
the rest of it sometime but here's why I
recommend it number one probably is not
really the best show for the younger set
I think maybe this would appeal to
people who are used to a certain kind of
movie
here's what I liked about it
they took what was good about movies in
the past and then they just made one of
those
and I thought to myself nobody thought
of that before
just take all the things that were good
about you know movies when we grew up
and just make one of those
so here's what they don't do
nobody is tied to a chair to be tortured
nobody
I know is that weird I don't believe
there's going to be a chase scene I I've
only seen a third of it I don't believe
there'll be a chase scene
the entire first part of the movie
where usually the first third of a movie
is where something terrible happens to
the hero
you know the hero gets divorced or his
family is wiped out or you know there's
a hurricane or something
but this was just fun
and there's like some mystery because
it's about a little murder mystery and
it's just fun and it's about characters
and actors that you've seen and a lot of
the actors are
ones you're familiar with so it's just
sort of fun to see them all in the same
place and stuff
and
it's sort of the perfect
um empty calories
now here's what will will never be true
it's not going to win any awards
no Awards will be won
all they did all they did was make it
incredibly
um
consumer right
they made something for the customer
so therefore it cannot win any awards
because the awards are won by people who
make movies for other people in the
movie industry so people could say my
God you're acting uh in that role that
made me feel terrible the entire time I
watched the movie but wow did you act
well you acted so well that I I have a
stomachache when I left I felt so bad
for you
but this movie just doesn't have any any
parts in it that I don't think you know
I haven't seen it but it looks like
that's their theme there won't be any
unpleasant parts
now you're not going to remember it
forever it's not going to be your
favorite movie but it really is giving
me hope
that somebody paid attention and figured
out how to make a movie you know finally
so give it a chance
all right here's something I learned
today that apparently everybody knew
about me
at least everybody in the local
subscription site
um
so Elon Musk tweeted today or yesterday
maybe almost no one seems to realize
that the head of bioethics at NIH
National Institute of Health the person
who is supposed to make sure that fauci
behaves ethically
is his wife
now how many of you who didn't know that
like me until today
how many of you also didn't know that
until today
now
it sounds like a joke doesn't it
it literally sounds like a joke
I heard uh Elon Musk say the other day
on some podcast or something he said
that every conspiracy theory about
Twitter turned out to be true
and he laughed because he couldn't think
of any any conspiracy theories about
Twitter that weren't actually
demonstrated to be true
and and this one this one is crazy
it's crazy now I don't think it
necessarily made any difference
like I'm not going to say that you know
if that had been different you know we
would have seen fauci in a different
light I doubt it but just the just the
fact that
that that person his wife was in that
job that's just too
to everything isn't it that's just too
much of everything
how could that possibly be true
I don't know how many times I've been
saying this lately I'll just look at
something that's definitely true
and I'll just say how could that
possibly be true how could it possibly
be true that the number one person who's
being questions on ethics his wife is in
charge of his ethics
like it yeah there are seven what eight
billion people in the world
the odds of that were low
but maybe they were high you know given
the way things work out
all right
um and then Musk
seems to be
um no it seems to be he's directly
accusing uh fauci of a gain of function
research which is another way Elon Musk
says is another way of saying bio weapon
and
and then he notes that fauci authored
the 2012 paper arguing for a gain of
function research
and that now this is all what musk is
tweeting I I can't
I'm not saying all this is true
I'm just going to say musk is tweeting
it right and it must said that Obama
wisely put this on pause meaning the
gain of function research but fauci
restarted it now again I don't know if
that's true
like I think that you would argue it's
not yes there's some indirect thing but
not a direct thing I don't know
uh and despite these glaring issues
uh Twitter nonetheless so at Twitter
there was an internal slack Channel
where they communicate with each other
on this little Channel
uh unironically called the fauci fan
club
So within Twitter there was there was
quote a fauci fan club and they had
their own slack group
and Elon Musk just just basically thinks
is funny
he just laughs at his own company that
he bought
all right
I don't know if this is the favorite
story of the day
but you all know the congressman Santos
the Republican who got who just got
elected and then apparently we find out
they didn't have the education he said
he didn't have a college degree
I think he didn't have one ah he said he
did didn't work at two prestigious
places that he said he did and I think
there were a bunch of other lies so
basically he just totally lied and got
elected anyway
now
there's a few things a few ways to go on
this story
number one
the question is should Republicans
try to take the high road
and even though the Democrats are full
of liars should they say no we cannot
have a liar in our midst
so we've got to get gotta get rid of
them or do they say no things are so
tight we need every vote we can get and
everybody's a liar so
you know what's the difference and I and
I have to admit I was sort of going back
and forth this morning trying to decide
which one made sense I like I was
thinking well
I do like
I I do like making a point of it because
it'd be a good way to establish
you know Republicans as at least trying
to be more
more honest
but on the other hand I can certainly
see the raw power argument and and
Congress is mostly a raw power situation
so you know playing within the rules
everybody lies he lied no big deal but
here's how I decided I made my final
decision on this
I think he should keep his job
as opposed to resigning
and here's why
do you know how entertaining it would be
to hear the other members of Congress
argue that they just can't have a liar
in their midst
you tell me that wouldn't be funny every
time
I don't care who says it I don't care if
the Republicans say it I don't care if
the Democrats that as long as they're
members of Congress
I want them on video saying we have to
get rid of rid of the Liars in Congress
I I just want to see that
that's all I I would personally find
that very entertaining no matter how
many times I saw it and I don't need to
point out
the hypocrisy right
so so we don't need to point that out
you know I could always tell the people
who believe what they read on Reddit
they come over here with some rumors
about me that are almost always out of
context or untrue it's always a Reddit
people
like I think anybody who actually
got their information anywhere else
doesn't have any yeah
so that so somebody's coming over here
just to say vaccine passports because
they actually believe that I was in
favor of them
so we'll get rid of the dumb people the
disinformed people
but they like to keep me busy
all right
um
so I thought it was interesting that
musk is directly accusing fauci of these
things because isn't there doesn't he
have any defense to that
he's got some defense does he
I don't know who's telling the truth or
but uh oh I guess we were talking about
Santos and then the other thing that
Santo said in his uh not quite truthful
way
was that he's a Catholic guy
but at one point he said that
he wasn't Jewish but that he was Jew
Dash ish
so your emphasis on the ish part so not
really not really a Jewish person
but he claimed that because he had some
family connection to Judaism that's
unclear that he was a Jewish ish
and then I saw the number of people who
are criticizing him and I thought
I'm a little uncomfortable with that
because while he's not Jewish he's only
Jewish
if you criticize him
you wouldn't be anti-semitic but
wouldn't you be a little
anti-semitic-ish
just a little bit so I don't want to
criticize them because
I don't know where that line is I I
don't want to be anti-semitic ish
about a guy who's not Jewish but he's
Jewish
so I mean
it's a dangerous it's dangerous out
there there's a landmine everywhere
would you take that chance no no don't
take a chance
so I'll just stay away from that
well there's a new book out called uh
from somebody named Thompson
escape from model land in this case it's
not
Victoria Secret models it is
um mathematical models
and these models being used to predict
the future
this will come as a big surprise to you
but did you know
that complex models that are used to
predict the future
I know this is going to be a real
surprise
not reliable
I know I know I was as shocked as you
were yeah so there's a book now to teach
people that Financial that complex
mathematical models don't actually
predict the future
amazing amazing
huh
well this brings me to my next topic
which is
I believe that doctors are learning the
hard way
how to analyze data
and by that I mean they're learning by
doing it wrong in public and having
people say that's not how you do that
and I think that I'm seeing at least in
my Twitter feed a lot of doctors who are
clearly now way more informed about how
to consume data
and here's here's what I would suggest
for doctors who didn't have any training
in this field I think you could simplify
it
to Simply a checklist
quiz to ask ask a doctor which of these
sources are reliable
and maybe a little bit about why it'd be
a really simple one-page test for
example
if you ask doctors to rate the
credibility of the following things I
don't know what they would say but let's
say you said
um
a study is published there's one study
it's not a randomized controlled trial
but it's just one one study in a
publication and it's published as
peer-reviewed
what level of confidence should you put
on one study
not a randomized controlled trial but
it's peer-reviewed and it's published
well the right answer is less than 50
because about half of them get retracted
but of the ones that don't get retracted
how many of those are too
nobody knows because they didn't get
retracted but it's not zero
right so it could be that something in
an order of
25 to 50 percent of studies that are
peer-reviewed and published turn out to
be true or useful
so would a doctor know that
and we're somewhat of course but how
many doctors would know
that being published means is usually
untrue
about I bet most would say well it might
be false but if it got published and
it's peer-reviewed is probably true
but actually it's the opposite it's
probably untrue
so would they even know which way it
goes would they know it's probably
untrue
or would they just assume it went
through the steps to you know validate
it a little bit so that is probably true
but maybe not it's a big difference
because that might be the difference
between
an off-label
you know
um treatment or not
how about this
how about a retrospective study a
retrospective study would somebody be
able to
know the value of a retrospective study
now that's where you you didn't do a
study in advance so you have to look at
it after the fact and so you say okay
yeah these people did take this and they
had these outcomes so it must have been
because they did the thing
now that's different than saying in
advance
if you say in advance we're going to
test this thing and we think it's going
to have this outcome
that's a that's a far more reliable way
to go but if you only did it once
and nobody reproduced it you're still
not where you want to be
right looking backwards is is going to
be less reliable
right would you all agree
looking backwards as opposed to
establishing a test where you can look
forward and find out if your guesses
were right so there's a big difference
all right how about this one
um
a 10-year projection
or even a three year or five year how
about just projections that are based on
good solid data and experts making yeah
the projections are usually ridiculous
usually ridiculous
how about the vares report
if the vares report is sending a really
strong signal
what's that telling doctors
well I know that many of you disagree
many of you would say whoa there's so
many on there about covet in particular
you would say well I realize it's
anecdotal but there's just so many on
there that that's telling you something
but not really
it isn't it is telling you you might
want to look into it
so so you know it's not to be ignored
that's why it's there it's not there to
be ignored
but you don't know for sure just from
the various report
how about uh a really good randomized
controlled trial
how much should you put how much should
you trust it a really good randomized
controlled you know blind trial
do you know what's missing
who funded it
who funded it right yes the only thing I
told you is there was a randomized
controlled trial the amount of
credibility you put in it is none
literally none
would you agree
the the gold standard in science is a
randomized controlled trial if the only
thing you know is that one happened
The credibility should be zero
now that's not something I don't think
doctors would agree with
I think doctors would say that's
actually our best evidence we do
everything based on that that should be
the best evidence
now
if you don't know who funded the trial
you don't know anything that's something
we learned right
now suppose you knew that it wasn't
funded by the pharmacistical companies
what then
you don't really know that
see it's a trick
I tried to trick you well what if you
don't what if you know it was not funded
by the pharmaceutical companies you'll
never know that it's unknowable because
they may have gotten to the person who
ran the trial
so they may not have funded the trial
but they might be the source of lots of
speaking agreements
for the project manager
you know what I mean would your doctor
know that
would your doctor know that yes it was
funded by this maybe the government but
would they know that the project manager
makes 40 more than his normal income by
doing speeches for that pharmaceutical
company
you would have no way of knowing that
so what we used to think was the gold
standard of science is closer to a coin
flip
you don't really know much of anything
unless you know who funded it or how
everybody's making their money
and if you only have one of them you
wish you had two
right
so if you only have one you're
automatically shaky compared to at least
two how about uh
yeah anything about any study that the
Pharma big Pharma does itself
should you believe it
because that would be the basis of all
vaccinations childhood vaccinations
right
aren't pretty much all childhood
vaccinations based on big Pharma Zone
studies
I'm just guessing I don't know if that's
true now presumably there would also be
other Studies by now but mostly they
were approved based on big Pharma Zone
studies right
I guess that's more of a question than a
statement I mean I assume that's the
case
so
uh and then what about meta metadata
studies or meta studies what about a
meta-analysis
should doctors
trust them because the meta-analysis
looks at all the studies or all the
relevant studies
so yeah they could be the best or they
could be the worst
but you don't know in advance
hahaha
so the weird the weird thing about a
medicine meta-analysis is it could be
exactly right
but you would have no no way of knowing
just because you did it or you do some
details you wouldn't know
but it could be so that so it doesn't
matter what it says you don't know which
one is the right one and and who who
cheated on what's in the analysis and
what's not in the L analysis so
meta-analysis is pretty low credibility
all right
question
how many uh Young Americans do you think
would be the fitness and health
requirements to join the American
Military what percentage
what percentage of
I I wasn't even doing it this time and
you still got the right answer
it's 23 about a quarter that I always do
the uh asking people to guess what the
poll results are because the the running
joke is that 25 of the public will get
every question wrong
every poll question the 25 will have the
dumb answer you know when there's one
that's like clearly the dumb answer 25
percent
well this has nothing to do with this
this is Health and Fitness
but only 23 percent of Young Americans
meet the fed this requirement of the
military
now allow me to do an old man thing I'm
going to do a grandpa thing
in my day
I feel like it would have been 75
percent of the kids I went to school
with
now I'm talking about the boys
wouldn't you agree
things have things have gone downhill
that much that only 23 percent could
pass the physical
and maybe do you think I'm remembering
wrong
could be false memory
because there weren't that many kids in
my class so it wasn't it wasn't a good
but 23 really that's all
yeah
um I'm going to shock you a little bit
more in a minute here
uh so obviously the military is having
trouble recruiting but one of the one of
the things that the military has decided
to do
is to reduce their standards for mental
health
so before they were you know pretty
tight you couldn't have any uh at least
a recent medical health problems
but now they're going to loosen that and
I think
ADHD is now going to be considered not a
problem
if if it hasn't been a problem recently
and I guess if if you're treating it
medically
I wonder if there could be any risks
to having more
more people with mental problems in the
military
what could go wrong what could go wrong
all right
um have you ever heard of
there's a movement called
Trad wives
I just read about this on CNN like a
minute before I went live
have you ever heard of Trad wives is
supposedly a growing theme the Trad is
short for traditional
and they're modeling after the 50s you
know stay-at-home housewife kind of
thing and there there's some number of
people who like the aesthetic
so they like the way they dressed and
sort of the way they
treated their husband as the boss of the
house I guess
and so some kind of a growing thing now
related to that was separate
I've told you there's a whole bunch of
relationship experts talking about what
doesn't doesn't work these days
but uh I've watched a number of these
relationship experts who have the same
line of thinking
and I don't know what's wrong with it
so I'm going to test it out of you
and it goes like this
if you're a woman and you're looking for
a guy
uh correctly if I'm wrong these are the
standard things that women are looking
for
now and these are the things that they
say most often now every woman is
different right every man is different
so this isn't all people it's just sort
of a you know generality
but here are the things all right uh and
this will be a little quiz for you uh
women usually like uh taller men over
six feet tall
what percentage of American men are over
six feet tall go
what percentage of American men are over
six feet tall
your guesses are unusually bad
not usually bad if I average your
guesses I think they'd be right the
answer is uh 14.5 percent
right so if you're a woman
on your first filter your first sort
you've eliminated 85 percent of all men
because only 14.5 are above that right
now if you go up to six six foot one
do you know how fast that drops
you get down to one percent really
quickly you know at around six three six
four it's down to like one percent
but let's say let's start with 14.5 so
that's your story now most women want a
guy who can provide
right no matter how modern the woman is
they still like the guy to have a job
that that's serious so how many how many
men of any height just men in general
American men how many uh have an income
over a hundred thousand a year
how many men this is married unmarried
just men
the answer is 13 13 percent
so if you were just simply going to find
somebody who is tall
and made over 100k a year
the the math of it is you would multiply
the two percentages together
so if you multiply 14.5 percent times 13
percent
it starts getting really small really
fast and that's just two filters here's
some more
suppose you wanted a guy who was going
to be faithful
you know basic right you want a guy
who's not going to cheat on you
but he's also over six feet tall and he
has a good income
what are the odds of somebody who is
tall and has a good income meaning the
most desirable man
what are the odds that he will be
faithful to one woman over a
relationship
let's say let's say charitably 50
percent
charitably right just so it doesn't
sound too terrible I'll say 50 percent
so that you would also multiply that by
the percentages
how many women how many women would
prefer a beta male over an alpha male
almost none right so women would also
want somebody who's projects at least an
alpha male how many men
project an alpha male
persona percentage-wise
I'm gonna I'm gonna charitably say half
would you accept it charitably half most
of you think way less than half but
let's say charitably half
right so that cuts in half again the
number of possibilities for the women
uh do you think the women care if the if
the man is has an addiction to drugs or
alcohol or a mental illness
what percent of men don't have an
addiction or a mental illness
again I don't know
maybe half
would you say half
just say half just so we can do the math
right so again you take what you've cut
down to already and cut that in half
again
how about
uh would women want a guy who's in
reasonably good shape now not
necessarily running marathons but just
somebody who's in the the better
the better quadrant
so maybe let's say 25 percent of men
would you say
25 percent of matter and reasonably good
shape you know they don't have to run
marathons let's say 25 so now take while
you're down to and you know take 25
percent
about the right religion the right age a
guy who will treat you right he's also
available so he has to be he has to be
available otherwise it's useless
and he has to like you and you have to
like him
so if you do the math
the the available number of people
that's right
If you eliminate all of the people on
all of those things do you know what's
left
Andrew Tate
Andrew Tate
that's all
and
um I don't know how many he can
handle uh according to him that's his
word I'm usually his word I would never
call women that never
what Andrew does so let me tell you
but he has he can only handle uh I don't
know maybe 100 or 200 per year
like maximum because he's busy he's got
some businesses to run he has to
exercise
needs to needs one hand to smoke his
cigar so like he can't handle thousands
of women now he does have a brother
and his brother can handle maybe a few
hundred extra but the Tates alone
can only handle
at most a thousand women out of all the
billions in the world
so you really can't depend on him to do
it all
right
so
do you know why AI is going to be a
problem it seems like I changed the
subject but I didn't
do you know why AI is going to be a
problem
because it might tell you the truth
hey AI
should I get married
what's AI going to say
or if you say what are my odds of being
happily married or finding a man that I
want to be married to and AI will say
well uh what what is your Criterion you
know get tell me what you're looking for
and you'd say well you're just tall and
blah blah blah and you say and then a I
would say all right your odds of finding
what you ABS the minimum that you need
to be happy are point zero zero zero
zero zero one
and it will be correct that will be the
actual right calculation
who would get married
is the end of civilization
you do understand
the civilization absolutely requires us
to be deluded all the time
because the moment you actually
understood the odds of things
you you change your behavior it would be
the end of civilization
speaking of Tate uh he uh tweeted at
Greta tunberg today he's very good at
being provocative and he tweeted uh
hello Greta tonberg I have 33 cars my
Bugatti has a big quad turbo engine my
two Ferraris have giant engines he goes
this is just the start
please provide your email address so I
can set the complete list of my car
collection and the respective enormous
emissions
so he tweeted that at Greta
Greta answered him back and she said yes
please do enlighten me you can email me
at small dick energy at getalife.com
so I'm glad the two of them are getting
along
so
I don't know I I don't want to like
Greta
because because I don't agree with her
climate Hysteria
but
I realized today that I have to delete
my Instagram app
did anybody else have this problem I
made the mistake of looking at some
Andrew Tate videos and now that's all
that feeds me
is nothing but Andrew Tay videos it's
like eighty percent of Andrew T videos
so that the entire the entire thing is
useless now
like I have to delete Instagram because
he actually polluted it and by the way I
don't have I'm not complaining about his
content
I'm not I'm not saying you know we
shouldn't be there I'm not saying it has
no value I'm just saying there's so much
of it
that you can't even use the app he
actually overwhelmed uh Instagram has
anybody else had that experience because
you only have to look at a few of them
and the the algorithm does the rest
so I have to search for other things
until it overwhelms them right
yeah
all right look at more Pat videos yeah I
think he overwhelmed the pet videos too
all right uh why is it that uh
why is it that we never blame the
brainwashers have you noticed that
so
the January 6th thing
we I guess Trump was blamed for quote
inciting violence
you know arguably that's it's a
debatable point
but is inciting the same as brainwashing
not really we use them differently right
somebody incited to do something you
think has not necessarily been
brainwashed you know maybe they're not
thinking clearly but not brainwashed per
se
was there anybody who did brainwash the
January six people
was there any any actual source of
brainwashing
of course it was yeah all of the media
that they were consuming
yeah maybe yeah maybe the FBI but
certainly the news they were watching
brainwashed them to think that the
election had been stolen and then
brainwashed them into thinking that
their actions would be productive
now you might say to me but Scott they
had free will
to which I say well they had Free Will
as long as physics stopped working
inside their skull
but if physics actually works everywhere
like inside your skull outside your
skull that is just causing the fact that
they were going to do what they were
going to do
but the brainwashers caused January 6.
right
even even if you imagine that Trump
did something extra to get them whipped
up that's very debatable
they were there for a particular reason
they had already been brainwashed
now does that mean that they're wrong no
I'm not saying they're wrong I'm saying
that they were not there based on
reasons and facts and logic they were
there
because they're brainwashed do you know
why the people who uh who observed it
believe it was an Insurrection instead
of a protest
why do the Democrats think they saw an
Insurrection an unarmed Insurrection why
would they think such a ridiculous thing
because they're brainwashed they're
brainwashed right there's no that's
obviously no critical thinking going on
there
it would take like this much critical
thinking like a a dollop to know that
and that unarmed Republicans are not
trying to take over a country like you
don't have to do deep thinking to figure
that out but still but still half of the
country believes is true and it would be
the most obviously untrue thing of all
time
so
but you know why we can't blame the
brainwashers right
there's a reason besides just political
it's because the entire Justice System
depends on the illusion of free will
if you take away the illusion of free
will you can't punish anybody if you get
if you can't punish anybody
then there's no legal system
as there's no legal system civilization
falls apart so the illusion that people
have this thing called Free Will as
opposed to being hypnotized by obvious
obvious brainwashers
you have to put the responsibility on
the person who does the act because it's
the only way civilization works
but it's not rational
it's completely irrational well except
that it works right but the the logic of
it doesn't hold up
I know it makes people's score of you
when I say Free Will is an illusion but
usually it's just people are defining it
differently if they that they just say
I can observe that somebody could choose
this way or choose this way so therefore
that free will to which I say you can't
observe that
you can't see the physics happening
inside their brain I say whatever they
did was the only thing they could have
done because physics only worked one way
in that case
all right
um
what presented this is a Rasmussen poll
what percentage of the country in June
of this year believed that Russia was
winning the war in June
25 percent that's right pretty close yep
25 actually uh 24. and so in June 24 of
the country thought Russia was winning
now it's 14 percent
14 of likely voters in America think
Russia is winning now about I think
about half of the people think that it
looks like a stalemate and the rest
think that Ukraine is winning
now
how many of you think Russia is winning
are you in the 14 14 percent
how many of you think Russia is winning
yeah you know it's hard to it's hard to
separate
Russia will win in the long run from
Russia is winning so the question is a
little unclear I'll give you that
already won somebody says
yeah well
um
have I ever mentioned to you
that things tend to go my way
and and you remember I I keep reminding
you that although I was a hundred
percent wrong
when I said that Putin wouldn't uh
actually invade Ukraine
the reason I said it was wrong is
because he he couldn't win
and that it was almost immediately
obvious he was going to get he was going
to get waxed
his army was
now when I said that at the time that he
invaded would you say that close to 90
percent of the public would have said
Russia is totally winning and going to
win would you agree
that at the point that I was saying that
Russia couldn't win 90 of the people
were get were on the other side now
is completely reversed
that the vast majority of America
believes what I believed would happen
from the start the Ukraine would
surprise everybody with a with better
performance than anybody thought
so I'm only going to point out
that things tend to go the way
I want them to
and I don't know why
I don't I honestly don't know why to me
it feels like I'm in a simulation and
I'm either
Imagining the things are going my way or
you know I'm influencing it somehow
or I'm the world's best predictor
you know even getting notable ones wrong
I'd still be the world's best predictor
I I don't understand it I honestly don't
but it's so consistent
you it's hard to find any major topic
that isn't going the direction
that I thought it would publicly I don't
know why
all right
um
let's see there's a new study out that
we don't believe because we don't
believe studies but it says that
metformin I think it's an
over-the-counter
um
diabetes drug that lowers your blood
sugar levels and it allegedly helps with
long covet
with long covet
like fairly substantially
first question how many of you believe
long covert exists
because I I had to uh do a Google search
today
because you know in the beginning people
were saying there'd be this long covet
and then there was a period where we
weren't sure if it was real
and I didn't know where that ended up so
if you if you do a Google search on is
long coveted real
Google will I'll only just tell you what
the search reveals I don't know it's
true but the search reveals
that most most of the media is saying
long covet is real the studies say is
real
but at the same time there are uh there
are studies saying it's not real in the
in the same time same time period in
April May of this year so there's a
little bit of a difference but but
overwhelmingly Google will say it's real
doesn't mean it's real just Google will
say that
now
is it interesting that metformin lowers
blood sugar levels because we knew that
the diabetics were having the worst time
with the covid right wasn't diabetes the
number one comorbidity you know sort of
co-co-morbidity with obesity at the same
time I imagine
so is sugar the villain in everything
like I I saw some experts saying that it
wasn't the lower blood sugar that makes
the metformin work if in fact it works
there was some other mechanism but I'm
not sure I believe that
because because the thing that we keep
seeing over and over again is that
having too much sugar in you is just
always bad for everything
am I wrong about that
there's like almost no exception right
did you put sugar in your body yes it's
bad for you I mean except for normal
carbs and stuff of course
so I don't know that would be my guess
without any medical training that if
everything that's add sugar is bad for
you in every possible way and everything
that decreases sugar in your body is
good for you in every possible way
I would think metformin would work
so I guess I'll believe this one because
it matches my
presumption
that's as good as you can do
um
so I heard Dr Robert Malone
famous uh co-inventor of the MRNA
technology and a famous famous critic of
the
lockdown and vaccination kind of regimen
and he told his reasons for getting
vaccinated
because if you didn't now he's
vaccinated he gave two reasons one
concern about long covet as opposed to
concern about dying
and he believed he actually had long
covered
and at the time it looked like a
vaccination would reduce your
long-coveted symptoms even after you had
the long covet
now he's not so sure that's true anymore
but a Google search
suggests that Google is telling you it
is still true a little bit it's a little
unclear
um but so Dr Malone said you got the
vaccination because he wanted to do
international travel it was the only way
he could do it practically and he wanted
to reduce his risk for long covet
does that sound familiar
is there anybody else you know
who made a decision
exactly the same exactly the same and
about the same time
yeah I did I did
so
for those of you who are here to tell me
I made the wrong decision
you could be right but I need you to
know I made exactly the same decision as
the world expert critic of the
vaccinations
so the smartest person in the whole
world
on this topic
made the same decision I did
because he was working with the same
data as we all were
so so somebody says copium Kyle Kyle
says that agreeing with the person that
you believe is the best source
that agreeing with your expert is is a
bad decision
that's your point of view
is it is it a cope
is it a cope or is it just a fact
that the person you believe is the most
qualified
agrees with me
is that a problem that you are expert
agrees with me
I'm just rubbing it in I just like
feeling right
so that's just for me
now
um
I'll tell you my current opinion my
current opinion is I doubt the
vaccinations help with long covet
I doubt it oh did did Dr McAuliffe get
vaccinated does anybody know
because I was wondering if the loan was
the only uh sort of I don't know if I
call him anti-vaccination but a
vaccination
program critic anyway I would call
okay so I'm gonna call it mcculloughton
and did he get he got covered though
right
did McCullough get covered I assume
everybody did at this point
don't know don't care
all right we'll look into that or I will
[Applause]
well ladies and gentlemen we're still in
the slow week of news
um somebody says yes he's vaccinated
but I don't know
Steve Kersh is crushing the provax peeps
let me ask you this are the anti-vaxx
doctors
the balloons and the McAuliffe's uh I I
don't want to call them anti-vaxx
because that's that's my labeling I
shouldn't do that but are those doctors
that are prominent critics of at least
some parts of the vaccination issue
um
do they think that the vaccinations are
still a good idea for older Americans
does anybody know that
is there anybody who says the
vaccinations are a mistake for old
people
well I asked the question wrong so now I
don't know what your answers mean
is there a general agreement that over
65
it still saves lives or is even that up
that's up in the air as well
so Malone thinks older people should get
it
they'll even kildorf and bought a car I
think it's okay above 65 okay so
so you're saying that even the even the
biggest critics would agree that I
should have gotten vaccinated is it is
that true
is it true that the biggest critics of
vaccinations that were the most expert
people
believe I made the right choice
so the only people who don't
believe that I made the right choice for
myself
are the people who don't believe their
own best experts
so the people who believe they're
experts
believe I made the right choice but the
people who believe that the people that
they trust the most are not credible
would think I made a mistake
and by the way I don't know if I made a
mistake or not
how would I know
sky has other comorbidities not really
I thought I had asthma but it turns on I
don't
foreign
so as long as you all agree that I made
the smartest decision
that anybody could have made in my
situation
and I think now that you all agree with
that I remember that a lot of people
were mocking me until they found out
that I made that I made the the choice
that their experts would recommend not
me
I I only did what my critics uh Godlike
experts recommended
so that's all I did
um
yeah I thought I had asthma at the time
and I was concerned about it and that
you know so under my bad information for
my own medical people
uh I was misinformed
I didn't do it just for vacation but
that was that was the the vacation was
the reason I did it when I did it
but the decision to do it was also
largely because of
I didn't want a long covet problem
but probably you know I'm not sure it
makes any difference
yeah all right
you were misinformed on everything covet
was I
did you just miss the entire last five
minutes
was I misinformed on everything covid
when we all just agreed that all of the
experts including the critics say people
in my category should have been
vaccinated
so
like some of you I I have no idea what
planet you're coming from
it's like it's like I don't even know I
don't even understand your comments at
some point it doesn't make sense at all
right
you got a lot quieter didn't you
you know if you told me that I was gonna
that at the end of this year I would be
arguing that Dr uh Dr Malone should be
totally uh totally believed because he
agrees completely with me
oh you didn't see that coming did you I
didn't see it coming I thought I was all
on my own here honestly I thought I was
just on my own here
all right there's nothing else to talk
about in the news unless you know
something so I'm going to go talk to the
locals people so uh
YouTube I'll talk to you later thanks
