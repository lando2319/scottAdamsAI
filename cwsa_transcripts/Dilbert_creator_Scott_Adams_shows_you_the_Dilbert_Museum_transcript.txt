and welcome to the tour of the Dilbert
studio in Dilbert Museum I'm live
streaming this so if you're playing it
back recorded you'll wonder why I'm
stalling but it's only so the people can
stream in and see it um I'll be checking
my comments mostly from the locals
people as I go but what I wanted to do
was show you my studio that I use for uh
for this for the live streams but also
show you the Dilbert Museum and how
Dilbert was
created now I don't see any comments on
the live chat yet I wonder if that means
something's not
working zero people on YouTube oh there
we
go so we'll uh look at the comments on
my phone here so I've got them
[Music]
separately and uh we'll start with a
little uh
huh apparently this isn't going to work
at
all let's see you're watching me on
locals but I don't see myself there I
am there we go all right so your the
microphone's a little different because
I'm not using the sh
microphone but uh I'm going to start
with telling you how I do this live
streams the moment I'm using a
mobile mobile
microphone so that I can walk
around but normally I just use my
Macintosh and a microphone and just this
little device that goes between the
microphone and the laptop to make it
compatible
and
then I set it all up on this
little stand behind me so the reason I
use these is so that it's same he as I
am it makes everything better so you
don't so you're not looking down at your
screen and for
lighting I use these ring lights there's
one one on each
side there one right back there and then
there's a couple in the room that
illuminate the room and then I use a
little light behind
me I just use this guy to oops to
illuminate the uh the
background and here's the mo here's the
most important part if you're going to
do any kind of live
streaming and you're trying to get the
lighting right which is always the
hardest part um you really want blackout
curtains so I've got blackout
curtains right
now and uh so I can make the place
completely completely dark and then I
can control the lighting
completely
um so here's the
uh here's how the comic used to be
made so for I don't know 10 or 15 years
I would draw it on the computer this is
after after
paper um and I'll show you the most
modern way I'm doing it in a little bit
but at the moment I'm using a smaller
a smaller uh device just so I can carry
it with me and take it wherever I want
but uh the big Wacom is the standard for
the the industry that's the one that all
the you know major cartoonists would use
it's it's made by walkom and it's called
a cintique c i n tiq you can just Google
it you'll find out what you need and you
just draw on it with a
stylus um like I said at the moment I'm
using a portable one called the move ink
also made by
W
and um the for the lettering um I've
created my own font so that uh I can
just type the uh the text into the
cartoons so this is what my studio looks
like I'll give you another wider
shot so here's the wide
shot and and I just put all my filing
together there's my wall of
books and we're going to take you into
the dber museum that's
nearby you ready for
that all right but
first I'm going to grab my phone so
that
huh somehow I managed to lose my phone
there it
is we're going to go into the Dilbert
Museum which is just a room that's next
to my
studio and uh from there I can answer
some
questions but
first here's my little wall of dilber
stuff some weird cartooning Awards and
dolls and stuff what you you might be
hearing some vacuum cleaning going on
downstairs all right
all right we're now in
the Dilbert
Museum I'll show it to you a wide
shot so you can just sort of ban around
and see what's going
on so here I've got all the books and
licensed materials and I'll show you a
little bit of
this and most importantly those are all
the t-shirts
we'll take a closer look a little bit
but behind me is the drawing table where
it all
started and here's where I can do the
best job of kind of showing you how it
all
started so this is this is actually the
table and
chair that I uh
used when I first
started so this this table was actually
uh left by the the renter who was in the
apartment before I was in
1987 or something and it was in San
Francisco and I I didn't have a table I
didn't have any furniture I didn't have
anything actually um so I just kept this
little table and I refinished it found
out that I'm really bad at
refinishing and uh this is where Dilbert
was born draw it was drawn on here the
the cheram in
was the chair that my mother and I put
together from other
chairs this was a project I did when I
was a
teenager so that's the chair that I took
with me it's one of the it's one of the
few things that I took with me from the
upstate New York to
California one of my few cherished items
I'm not big
on physical
assets this
clock um is my nemesis
because that's the thing I would look at
when I would get up and have to get a
cartoon done before 4:30 in the
morning actually I would started around
4:00 A.M uh in the in the days when I
was working my day job and I would sit
here in the in the early morning and I
had to finish a cartoon in about an hour
if I didn't finish it in an hour from
beginning to end at least the first
draft um I wouldn't have a cartoon that
day so I do one cartoon a day no matter
what weekends and holidays
included and when I was getting close to
the end of my hour I'd be looking at
this clock across the room and saying no
no give me more time but so far I
haven't missed the haven't missed the
date in 35 years it's pretty good um
I've got a deadline every single day
because it's seven days a week even
holidays um and I haven't missed a
single deadline 35 years so part of it
is making sure that you're
Ahad this device is called a light box
and what you
do is if you've got a comic that you
already like this is back in the days
when I was drawn on
paper by the way just
checking
um all right good looks like the sound
is
working so this is what an original
looked like back in the days when it was
done on
paper where you see that there seems to
be some shading like on his coat uh that
was done with a decal you actually put a
decal over it that's got dots on it and
they use an xacto knife to cut around
the part you don't want so it just
leaves the part you
want then if you wanted to if you wanted
to reproduce something that was on one
of your drawings let's say you wanted to
reproduce this scene in the third panel
but a little bit different you would put
on the light
box and then you would put the art that
you were the new art on top of
it and when you turned on the light box
the bottom art would shine through
through the top one almost like tracing
paper so that you could trace the parts
you wanted to keep and then just modify
the part that uh was going to be
different
so this is the pre-computer way of doing
it um you might
ask Scott where did you get all of your
artistic talent now you didn't really
ask that did you because I don't have
much artistic talent but it turns out
that um my family members
do so you see this this painting behind
me and the other one those were my
mother's so she's she is a passed away
but uh she was a a landscape artist in
day and she sold everything that she put
up for sale the only reason I have these
is that she didn't she didn't think they
were good enough to sell so the ones
that I got to keep are the ones that she
considered her worst work so she didn't
release those to the galleries well you
can see she was pretty good um she sold
everything that she tried to sell my
father was uh not so talented but he was
very
enthusiastic and he would make little
wooden things
that would sort of be dilber because he
thought he' like them
uh he it's got a it's got a strange look
to it
like I've always liked his weird
artwork but uh not classically trained
and my brother and sister have some
artistic talents as well now behind
you is how it all
started um here's here's the quick story
of how dber got started um my corporate
career wasn't working out because I was
a white guy literally my bosses told me
they couldn't promote couldn't promote
me because I was white and male so I
started the dilber cartoon on the side
while I was still working my day job and
was trying to figure out how do you
become a cartoonist because I always
wanted to be one but I didn't know how
to do it so I saw a TV
show um called um called funny business
I think it was the art of cartooning or
something and I missed the whole show
but I I caught the closing credits back
in the days before before too and that
kind of thing and I quickly wrote down
the the address and sent a letter to the
host of the show and uh sent him some
samples and said hey I'd like to be a
cartoonist how do you do that and he
said pick up one of these
books so
probably it was this one it must have
been this
one so remember this is pre- internet so
there was a book called artist markets
that they updated once a year and this
literally tells you how to get into any
art business if it involves somebody
paying you for what you do so if you
looked up
cartooning which I won't do because
it'll take too long
but oh I've got something something uh
marked
here all right so syndic oh interesting
I'm finding my own notes from
1988 so this is for syndicated
cartoonists and it talks about how Jim
Davis got
syndicated and Gary Larson's and it says
how to contact them and it says develop
a sample package that contains a cover
later cover letter with your background
the intent and uh several weeks of
strips so it tells you exactly who to
send it to there were about half a dozen
companies that did syndication
syndication means that you sign a deal
with a syndicator and then they sell it
to newspapers so they have a Salesforce
that tries to sell it to as many as they
can so I followed the directions
and just as they said I put together my
submission package here's the original
Dilbert submission package and as I put
on put a cover letter on there so here's
my cover letter telling a little bit
about
me and
then about 50
examples so here were the very first
drawings of Dilbert and
dogbert you can see that they look a bit
different
now you can tell that I'm not an
artist at that
point
so I wasn't expecting too
much but one by one all of the cartoon
syndicates sent me back a rejection and
they said
that
um had a
rejection and finally I got uh one phone
call from a woman who said she worked
for a company called United media and
she saw my sample and wanted to offer me
a contract to become a syndicated
cartoonist but I'd never heard of her
company and I hadn't sent my samples to
anybody called the United media so I'm
thinking this feels a little sketchy
right how does this person this
stranger how does she even
know that wanted to be a cartoonist but
somehow she had my materials turns out I
didn't recognize the name of her company
because she was talking about the parent
company not the syndication company that
was below
it which I would have
recognized and
uh I thought uh I'm not sure I trust
this woman on the phone and I said well
I'm flattered that you would offer me
this contract but do you have any uh
references anybody I could talk to to
you know make sure you're legit an
outfit and she said uh yeah we handle uh
peanuts and
Garfield and marmaduk and Robot Man and
then once she got to about the 12th name
on the list that's when I realized my
negotiating position had been
compromised and I said yes so the the
yes is a is always a tentative yes
because you work together for a few
months to make sure it's really going to
work and there there's a long
negotiation with lawyers and contracts
and stuff like that but I think it was
about a year later
1989 in April it
launched and it was in
about zero
newspapers so a number of newspapers
bought it but as was common at the time
and maybe it's still common they would
often say well we don't have room for it
but just in case it becomes a big hit we
want to make sure that our competitor
doesn't get it so we would the salese
would sell it exclusively within each
each market so if you were one of two
newspapers in San Diego for example back
when they were two um it was easy to
sell it because it didn't cost much per
week it' be you know 10 or 20 bucks per
week to own it if you're a
newspaper and if it blew up because
other people published it then you could
just put it in your newspaper and you
could you know get a scoop on the
competition but since everybody did the
same strategy which is to buy it and
then not run it just in case it got big
on its own it didn't run anywhere it may
it may have run in one newspaper on the
first day maybe the New York Post but um
it was hard to confirm that any
newspaper ran it at all slowly it got to
about 35 newspapers small ones so there
was this whole struggle to get into a
big one but eventually you got into the
Boston Globe and got into the San Jose
Mercury News and eventually it was 2,000
newspapers all over the world um but
most of that is because the internet was
new and when the regular marketing of
the syndication company didn't work
didn't work at all um I put Dilbert on a
website with the help of the syndication
company and it was the first syndicated
comic on the internet and because it was
about a technology guy um it was a
perfect combination so dilber became a
hit on the internet and then it was easy
for the salespeople to go to the
newspapers and say look here are all
these emails from people in your in your
ZIP code who want this comic they're
asking for it because people were asking
for
it so that's how it all started and I
drew it on paper for I don't know the
first 20 years or so then I had a
problem with my hand the same problem I
had with my voice this muscle spasma
thing and I had to switch to drawing on
the computer because it fooled my brain
into thinking I wasn't drawing because
the hand problem is actually a brain
problem that makes your hand scramble
but only when you're doing something
specific that you've done too much so by
drawing on the
computer my brain didn't recognize as
drawing even though it was the same so
it didn't spous in my hands so I got to
do that for a number of years later even
that became that became its own problem
you but it was years later at the moment
I use a different grip when I draw but
it works fine all right
so this is the the history place here
here's something you didn't
know there was already a Dilbert cartoon
before I
started and it turns out it
this let's see if I can put it here at
times dilber is inclined to be a little
absentminded you see the symbol down in
the corner there it's the US Navy so the
US Navy had their own cartoonist who did
a cartoon called Dilbert and Dilbert was
the the idiot who did everything wrong
and then he would get everybody in
trouble and cra es airplane and uh there
is still something called the Dilbert
dunker if any of you have some uh air
some uh
Navy um Navy Aviator experience you'll
know what the Dilbert dunker is um
that's for people who might end up in
inside their airplane underwater and it
was how to get out of your airplane if
it was underwater so the dilber dunker
was a
training uh a training device to see if
you could get down to the
emergency so let me show you a few other
things you might like
it you know Christmas is
coming you know where this is going
don't
you here's uh three of my books that if
you go to amazon.com Google them you can
find them all but more importantly the
2025 dilbur calendar made in the USA for
the first time in 20 for
2025 and this time it shows twice as
many Comics because there's going to be
comics on the front like
always but also comics on the back the
ones on the back are the spicy ones
called Dilbert reborn these are the ones
that I drew after I got cancelled so I
had more
freedom and the one and only place you
can buy this is at the link at
dilbert.com it's not on Amazon it's not
in stores but it's made in America for
the first time go to dilbert.com and
you'll see the the link to go by it um
here is my
wall of licensed materials actually a
few different walls but you can see that
when dilber got really
big there was just every kind of product
you know there's ilur pens
there were weird little 3D dilbur things
I don't know if it shows it's
3D um there were dber lottery tickets
and there were phone
covers you remember these old
phones phone
covers and uh just about every kind of
every kind of thing you can imagine but
let me show you
some some other stuff
So eventually I was asked to write a
book called The the dilber principle and
it made number one on the bestseller
list the year at what year was this
1996 and it did so well um and just hit
the number one on the non non-fiction
list it did so well that my publisher
said hey we need to do another one of
these so instead of writing new book
which would have been hard um I took all
the things that that weren't good enough
to be in the first book because I wrote
about twice as much as I needed and we
put that in a second book it was a huge
hit so the second book which was
literally the things I I was going to
throw away because it wasn't good enough
for the the first
book is sitting here at number two on
the New York Times bestseller list so I
was number one and number two and number
two was the things I was throwing away
from number
one so that
happened
um you were so forward to require all
those yeah I did keep a
lot so here I've got a
uh I I've got all of my uh my videos for
my speeches during the years and uh a
lot of my childhood and stuff so you can
see my uh my early upbringing there you
see all the all the digital assets I
have got digitized and you know they're
just there for perusing but let's show
you some other
stuff here's the uh the wall of
dolls got got every kind of
doll these were always big feel so rude
to hold him by the head point he boss
this was back when he had neck ties he
hasn't had a necktie in about 20 years I
think and
then there were all kinds of
shirts of course they're on here so
tightly I can't show you any of them but
if I could you'd say hey there's a
shirt then
there's a bunch of
magazines you've got an autographed
dilber doll really so back when
magazines were a thing dilber was on a
lot of
them but it was a little insulting to
me show you
why so I finally made it to the cover of
Thai
magazine but since I wasn't recognizable
they made me put a mask of Dilbert in
front of my
face so here here I am one of the most
influential people in America and they
won't show my face Come On Time
Magazine I think Time Magazine is
probably for a sale
now it should be then there was the
Dilbert TV
show Dilbert complete series ran for two
half Seasons you look do you notice how
not like Dilbert at that art
looks like the glasses looks like it was
drawn by a
child that in those days I was so busy
that I wasn't approving every single
thing it looks like it was drawn by
somebody who was like really drunk and
this is the cover the cover for it and
like it doesn't even look like the
character anyway
I had a lot to impr lot to approve in
those days it was hard to keep up with
it here's one of my
favorites look at those little Little
Darlings in there isn't that
cute by the way real story the Alice
character this
character is based on a real
person uh one of my co-workers and Wally
is also based on a coworker roughly the
boss is more of a composite of
people and
then some of my favorite
mugs oh wait this is full of stuff
H just realized this mug is full of it's
got keychains here I didn't even know I
had these apparently I have
keychains that's
cool
huh I'm glad I found
those and
all
right so I'm looking to see if you got
any questions about
Dilbert who is the world's smartest
Garbage Man based on good question so
the world's smartest garbage B is not
based on anybody specifically it's a
it's a a cartoon um
technique so the technique is to uh
design
characters design characters who um are
the opposite of their stereotype so the
opposite of The Stereotype of the
garbage man is that he's also a genius
so if I have a a doctor character in
Dilbert instead of the doctor wanting to
cure Dilbert he might want to kill him
so it's just a common technique to make
people the opposite of what their
stereotype
is all right
um you buy
what you buy abandoned storage and hope
to find something Dilbert in there well
good luck with
that is dver reborn my favorite era it
is for being creative yes so so after I
got
canell I got the freedom to put DB
behind the subscription service um on
locals and also on X so that uh I can be
at least
PG-13 because it's really hard to be
funny if you can't be a little bit edgy
just a little bit and I couldn't do that
in newspapers but uh in the in the
larger world of the internet you can you
can be a little bit naughtier so I go I
go to to about PG-13 at
most oh you got a you've got some dver
books
there uh will I put the framed pictures
on the walls oh yeah
so so there's a whole bunch of
uh framed covers these are all magazine
covers they got about 20 of
them so at some point they will be put
up on the uh on the
wall so
um I see a lot of you talking about the
news oh am I worried that it ever run
out a material actually no believe it or
not that hasn't been a worry I mean I
think that was a worry in the first
year but there are so many weird things
about the world and so many little
annoyances there's just always
something um other cartoonists that
inspired me
yes um I liked all the Mad Magazine
cartoonists I like Gary
Larson um peanuts was the biggest
influence so some of them are I just
like like Calvin and
Hobbs um but I can't I can't reproduce
that art or that writing so it wasn't an
inspiration per se
all
right um yeah Sergio aragones was uh was
one of my favorites as Sergio aragones
the the Mad Magazine artist who did the
little comics of the little Mexican guys
in the in the
margins and uh he actually ended up
giving me my award when I won the top
cartooning award um he actually handed
it to me and that was kind of cool
um yeah everybody loves
Waterson do you know when you're a
Cartoonist the thing that we hate the
most I'm going to tell you what every
cartoonist except for Waton hates the
most if you tell anybody that you're a
cartoonist for the last 25 years do you
know what they say oh wow I love Kelvin
and Hobs do you know him
every
time I am so tired of Bill Waterson I've
never met him by the way uh but I've
been asked if I know
him a billion
times and I
don't did I like beis and bad yeah I
mean be and bad is one joke but it was a
funny one but yeah I like
it uh Orrum of course was amazing but
again he wasn't really an inspiration
because I couldn't I couldn't do what he
does all right uh Garfield was not a
direct
inspiration but it was a it was an
inspiration in the sense
of um it looked like it was
doable meaning you know I looked at the
other Comics that were in the newspaper
and I thought you know I feel like I
could do
that all right dilbur AI coming next
well AI isn't quite there so here's my
current plan I'm thinking of starting a
a
foundation that would be um dedicated to
you know
maintaining let's say
continuing the uh
education from my books so that people
could have access to it after I'm on
um and part of that plan would be to
create a
robot and an AI That's based on me so
that I could have the robot someday do
the same tour that I'm giving you right
now so in theory at some point um a a
Scott Adams robot with my personality
and voice can give the same tour that
I'm giving you right now that's the plan
uh Dilbert I started in my early 30s 32
I can't remember the
exact you do the
math favorite South Park oh I don't I
don't really remember any of
them I don't really think of it that
way um by 240 well I don't know when but
it won't be too long
all
right
um arrum Drew for your father's Greening
card company oh I'll be darn small
world all right
uh right the conversation is going wild
here
you're in the restaurant so you can't
hear when it was the first coffee was
Scott Adams well I don't know when I
first started calling it that but it
must have been 2015 or 16 when I started
doing periscopes and then it
evolved what modern corporate entity
most reminds me of Gilbert's
World well you have to be on the
inside to to know that um but certainly
when I try to access anything in the
health care
domain it just seems like a very Dilbert
world how many Comics would you usually
have written in
advance well the first day I was
syndicated I was almost 6 months ahead
of time meaning that um the comics I was
drawing day wouldn't show up for six
months so I had a lot this huge lead
time and that's one of the reasons they
don't publish you the same day that they
sign a contract they need to know that
you can do this every day so you do it
for six months just to show that you can
do it every day and then you've got a
six months in the bank in case something
comes up so slowly over
time um as I got into marriages and
relationships um I would be with people
didn't like the idea that I worked every
single
day so because I had some in the bank I
could sometimes take a day off from
drawing um I I think I worked every day
but I didn't I didn't complete a cartoon
every
day and slowly that went down until if I
don't draw a cartoon today I don't know
when it will get drawn for
Monday so the the the last cartoon I
drew was yesterday which which will run
on on Sunday so the day after
tomorrow so if I don't draw one really
fast like I better do it maybe today um
then my art director who does the
finishing so the these days I don't do
the finished art I used to do the whole
thing from top to bottom most of my
career but then when my hand started
getting funky I I would do rough drafts
because I can do that and then my art
director finishes the Le
art all
right did they ever do talk shows well
I've been on a zillion interview
shows if that's what you
mean um Bill Waterson would not license
why see here here's my
point I'm here alive talking to you and
and still your curiosity is what can I
tell you about Bill
Waterson out of principle I'm not going
to answer that question I know the
answer I do know the answer but on a
principle alone I'm not going to answer
questions about other cartoonists while
I'm doing this
live I'll answer you another
time which dilber tip would be my
favorite
um it
changes so there'll be a period of years
when one is my favorite then another one
replaces it but for a long time one of
my favorites was um a shook the intern
who is complaining about his pay and in
one of the panels he casually mentions
that he makes his own underpan s of
sandwich
bags i' I've been laughing for decades
over that he makes his own underpants on
his sandwich
bags CU you can just you can just see
have got little leg holes I don't know
for me that's
hilarious all right
um if you come up with material so fast
you ever look back and think I should
have used different wording yeah you you
do that the whole time you're making a
cartoon
so I'll I'll write the first you know
version of it and then I'll look at it
and I'll rewrite it rewrite it and
rewrite it and then later when I'm
drawing it I might look at it again and
go you know little wording change and
then my um when my art director finishes
it the the lettering is still a separate
layer so I can change the lettering
without affecting the art and sometimes
I'll make a change you know right before
I publish it so it never stops
changing um if I say anything I don't
like I I just change it right away way
it's because there's no work involved
it's just typing
it uh alternate cartoon
Universe um are you trying to trick me
into saying would I have Dilbert go into
an alternate cartoon universe that's
skeleton and Hobbs is that where this is
going uh I don't know any any
alternative Universe would be fun
did Dilbert's head get smaller when I
handed it off to the art person that's
funny I I don't think his head got
smaller but his hands did so my my art
director would consistently draw the
hands really small and uh that you know
but now they're now they're on
point um
regrets
no do I have any major regrets about my
cartooning career
No No in fact I don't have any regrets
about anything I don't even know how
what that feels like what's it feel like
to have regrets I've never had
any there there are definitely things
which I could objectively say it would
be better if that thing didn't happen I
mean there's that but I don't
really I don't process it as regret it's
simply what happened
[Music]
um oh my my art director is amazingly
talented yes she's she's quite
amazing yeah I just don't I don't feel
regret was I
discouraged um
well I I wrote a whole book to answer
your
question had a failed
almost everything and still went big
so the cartooning was just one of many
examples where I had big Ambitions but
it didn't work out right
away so I typically am good at just sort
of processing that didn't work and
moving on to the next thing because I
was always sure that something would
work that there was never a time when I
thought I wouldn't break through I just
didn't know how or when or what that
would look like but from the time I was
was you know old enough to know I
existed I just thought it would work out
and it
did a digital Dilbert Museum I can do
that whoa 50 Dilbert books holy
cow
um have I ever asked AI to make a new
Dilbert movie no AI is isn't really
there yet maybe it will
be uh are there topics that are easy to
make fun of and ones that are hard yes
the ones that are easy is the the ideal
thing for a cartoonist is to find a
annoyance that everybody has or at least
your readers have but nobody has talked
about yet if you can find that it's
really easy to write the joke but you
have to come up with the concept the
concept of something that you know
people are thinking about but nobody's
done it to death yet it's not overdone
but the hardest thing to write is
anything about
food or any kind of health problem if
you do anything with a health problem
somebody has that problem and you're
going to hear from
them
so so that's a thing
uh Dilbert movie and the cards you know
I wrote a Dilbert movie or at least the
outliner one and the reason I canceled
my project is because of
Dei so years ago I was working on a
Dilbert movie and I wrote the whole
thing this is a True Story by the way um
I in fact this this very room I had used
as my uh script writing room so I had
you know the pages the notes all over
the walls so I could visualize all the
scenes and everything put immense amount
of work into it and when I finally had
the story done I still needed to write
dialogue but the basic story was done um
I canned the whole thing because I
realized I'll tell you the ending I I'll
tell you the surprise ending and then
you can tell me why I canceled it right
so the surprise ending was that there
was some kind of um genius in
in Dilbert's family that caused him to
be an engineering genius basically and
Dilbert's father is never
shown so I wrote the movie so that you
would assume that the father who left
when he was a child was actually the
genius that caused Dilbert to be the
engineering genius because the father
was an engineer
too so that was a trick to make you go
through the whole movie thinking that
the missing father might be manipulating
things behind the scenes and then at the
end you're going to find out who the
father is but I trick you in the end you
find out it was always the mother and
that the mother was the engineering
genius and she set up Dilbert to be
basically the
successor uh but she's running like this
Batcave where she's where she has
immense control of the entire world
because she's a genius but because of
sexism when when she came about you know
at her age
she couldn't be an
engineer so she had to be a secret
engineer and it was you know remains a
secret and then at the end dilbur would
find out the truth you see why I threw
it
away is it
obvious here's what's wrong with
it I wrote it to social
expectations because I knew if I made
the woman the smart person
and I made all the men idiots I could
sell the
movie but you couldn't do it the other
way around obviously and when I realized
that my script was a total sellout to
Dei and that all I done is bowed to the
bow to the gods of
wokeness I threw the whole thing away
and said nope I'm not going to make this
movie so i' I'd gone so far in that
specific movie that when I realized it
was completely
devoid
of artistic
spark it was really just crafted like I
thought you know the audience needs to
see which is why movies are
terrible if I watch a movie made by
anybody else the problem is I it's
obvious that they made it to to hit a
bunch of check marks and have the right
Dei you know people working in the right
roles and stuff and then it's no fun to
watch because you know they put all
their effort into things that didn't
really help the story you know that
that's where the emphasis
was and once I
realized that I had become one of those
people who was just
regurgitating what I thought a movie was
supposed to look like then it wasn't art
and it wasn't
fun and I couldn't put more work into
it um I use visualization and positive
thinking yes that's how Dilbert got
started one of my first affirmations was
um I Scott Adams will be a famous
cartoonist that's probably one that I've
used the most way before I had a
contract and then when I got my first
book
deal um I used an affirmation that I
would become a number one bestseller and
it became a number one bestseller
so yeah I use affirmations quite a
bit I've got one going now that I can't
tell you about
but sure hope it
works um what real personality because
Philip bump has made guest appearances
Delver well um Donald
Trump uh Trump was in an early dber
comic other guest appearances
hm I don't know I I usually don't do too
many guest appearances so got to think
of another one right
now um I learned affirmations in my 20s
so I didn't really and I've written
about it a lot so I guess I've taught
people yeah Jim Carrey credits
affirmations that's
correct was Jake Tapper the only guest
dber cartoonist no um also traded comics
with the the Family Circus cartoonist
Bill Keane so Bill Keane um Drew Dilbert
and I drew his comic
once that that's the thing cartoonists
do sometimes they they'll sometimes draw
each other's
comic all
right any other questions
all right um I think I'm going to wrap
it up here if we uh if we don't have any
other questions if you missed the first
part you can replay it and uh remember
