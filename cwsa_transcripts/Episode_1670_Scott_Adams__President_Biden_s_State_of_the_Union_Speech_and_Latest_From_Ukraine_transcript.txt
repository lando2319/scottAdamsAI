good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of your life it's called
coffee with scott adams and i know i
know it doesn't get better than this
that's why you were thinking i just
picked up on it
looks like our volume is good our sound
is good our picture is good
it's an amazing day and let's take it up
a notch all you need is our copper mug
or glass to tank anchor challenges tying
the canteen jug of flask vessel to any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine the other day
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it does everything including
stopping a russian military convoy 40
miles long yeah that's the simultaneous
sip go
ah all right
well let's talk about all the things
um
you know
do you ever wonder if whenever there's a
big story going on such as ukraine
does anybody ever try to slip us
a big story past the
the filter
try to try to just slip a big story past
the people watching
when everybody's looking the other
direction
yeah nothing like that happened nothing
like that happened
it was a little story about
mark zuckerberg's money
that was funneled into the wisconsin
uh state elections while the national
elections but the state was running them
in wisconsin a little story about
apparently the way the money was used to
get out the vote
was actually bribery
and illegal
that's right
wisconsin
i can't use i can't use the words to
describe what happened there apparently
or reportedly
because i would get kicked off social
media
seriously
i can't even tell you what the news is i
think i would get kicked off social
media and i'm being serious
it's the news
it's not something i'm making up
i'm just reporting what the news is
saying
and the news is reporting
that wisconsin found that the zuckerberg
money that went in to
allegedly help get out the vote
was in several cases breaking the law
and really important laws it turns out
and
no surprise
do you know why there are laws against
that sort of thing
so that this doesn't happen
that's why they have those laws
they have those laws
so that exactly this doesn't happen it's
not like
i just want to be
you know very specific here it's not
like
the zuckerberg money did something that
somebody discovered after the fact wow
it technically violated a law
it technically violated it
no it wasn't that
it was just violated
it was exactly violated
it was here's the law here's the offense
yup that fits exactly
now
at this point
can you make a definitive conclusion
about the uh
let's say the credibility of the 2022
election
yes you can
i'm not going to say it out loud
because they'll be kicked off of social
media
but i think if one of the key swing
states
uh can show that their their local laws
were broken by the sound side money and
pretty much everybody thinks the sound
side money did make a difference
let's see the money made a difference in
the election
it was illegal
you know what word somebody would use
for that kind of situation
it would start with an
r and it would end with an egged
but i wouldn't say it
because
as you know
no court
no court
has found any fraud
well until now
now the courts haven't found it yet
but i'm pretty sure they're going to
find it
if i had to guess
well so that's uh interesting
rasmus and nespol about uh impressions
of nato
uh u.s impressions
and people in the u.s
had a 65 favorable opinion of nato which
is pretty high
for
the united states
and the another question was should u.s
continue to give more money to nato than
other countries because i guess we give
about a quarter of the budget
53 said no we shouldn't give more money
32 said yes we should give more money to
nato than other countries
now
is it your first impression
uh
who would be against
the united states paying less
and the other countries pay more
how would you be against that
and the answer is i don't think you'd
have as much influence on nato if you
only spend two percent
but if you're if you're
25 of the budget
then you get to decide what nato does
which is sort of a bargain
you could say
but i wouldn't compare it just dollar to
dollar there's influence in there
all right
so let's talk about ukraine and try to
guess what's happening through the fog
of war and the
haze of reality
how much of what's coming out of ukraine
do you think is true
i'm going to say that nearly a hundred
percent of the things that are
pro-ukraine
are
nearly i mean some of it might be
accidentally true for example
zielinski is probably still alive
that's probably true
but do you believe the stories of great
heroism and
how the russian army has been stopped
and running out of gas and all their
conscripts don't even know what war
they're in and
all that stuff
well
maybe the individual some of the
individual stories are true especially
about the russian conscripts
but we have debunked most of it by now
right the
13 ukrainians bravely
telling
russian navy to fu
well that didn't happen
they were just captured
they weren't killed
so
pretty much a lot of this stuff you're
seeing from pro ukraine is part of a
very sophisticated persuasion
campaign that's worth working perfectly
it's really working well
because the the west is galvanized and
it's all persuasion
because think about the argument on the
other side which was expressed by
uh let's see colonel
colonel mcgregor he was on trey gowdy's
show on fox news
and he was basically saying uh
i'm going to paraphrase so this isn't
exactly what he said
just to be clear
like approximately the idea is
that ukraine has basically been
traditionally russia
russia told us forever that if we look
to put missiles there it'd be a problem
he did exactly what he's been saying you
would do for 15 years
it's just history it's fate
there's nothing you could do about it
and stop sending weapons to ukraine
you'll just get more people killed you
should hope that they surrender as fast
as possible because it's just one
corrupt government being surrounded by
being replaced by another corrupt
government so you don't really buy
anything and there's zelinski's not
george washington he's just another
corrupt guy who's trying to keep his job
so that would be one point of view now
what part of that point of view
could you debunk
don't know that you could debunk any of
it could you
if you phrase it right and you frame it
right
it looks like the west provoked
a war it didn't need to provoke
it looked like the west was the
aggressor
by trying to turn a
a country that could have been neutral
could have been neutral
if we'd pushed for that
could have been neutral and we pushed
for it to be more aggressively nato
who exactly started this war
i think nato did
i think nato started the war
by
crossing a line they knew would start a
war
i mean if somebody says if you do this
for 15 years in a row it says if you do
this it's going to be a big problem and
then you do it
well you can't say you were surprised
right
so i would say that there's a solid
argument that nato the united states the
west
uh provoked it
here's the counter argument
if let's say
uh
hitler
no i won't use hitler
let's say uh
let's say there was uh let's say what
would be well no i'm not going to use an
example
as soon as i use an analogy you'll just
argue about the analogy so i won't do
that i'll
i'll resist the temptation to use an
analogy
but let me just say that there is a way
to frame this story in which ukraine is
not a good guy whatsoever
the ukraine is just using the united
states has persuaded us that they're the
good guys they're a bunch of kleptocrats
uh replacing them with putin wouldn't
make any difference to the people in in
ukraine because they would just go about
their day with another
illegitimate government so
um that's one version and then the other
version is that you know putin is
basically hitler and yeah if he doesn't
conquer you if he conquers ukraine he'll
keep on going
how true is that
how true is it that putin
if he got away with taking over
countries more of it he's already gotten
away with it but if he keeps getting
away with it he would keep doing it
true or false
i feel like that's kind of true
it feels pretty true
because russia is a power-based
philosophy right
if they have the power
they use it and when they don't have the
power
they don't use it
and maybe that's it
there's no there's no other nuance
whatsoever
when they have the power they use it
because they think
you know russia is a big strong powerful
country and
if they have the power they use it
so both of those narratives i think are
100 accurate
so we're basically looking at two sides
that are somewhat unredeemable
in terms of the governments not the
people of course but the governments of
both sides are completely irredeemable
so you could take either side you wanted
i think the united states is just taking
a strategic
here's what i think happened and a
little bit of this is informed by
a tweet i saw by camille galive
he seems to know something about this
situation but he talks about uh you know
how russia operates
and he had this
uh observation
that uh there's some kind of a
philosophy that countries can optimize
their land-based army or their sea-based
military
but they can't optimize both it's just
too difficult it would just be too
expensive to have two optimized
armies you know one in naval and one on
land now i'm pretty sure the united
states does exactly that i think we
optimize all of it because we can
but a normal country
russia
just doesn't really have the the money
to optimize both the navy and the land
now here's where it gets interesting
apparently the soviet union did have the
money
so they could have
land and sea optimized
russia doesn't but they didn't want to
give up their you know largish
navy so they kept a large optimized navy
which meant it became largely impossible
to optimize their
their land-based army so the hypothesis
is
that however good you think the russian
army is
you're way off
they're nowhere near as good as you
think
because they're not optimized but maybe
the navy is
i don't know i'm not i would doubt that
too but
um so the idea is that it's so there's a
little bit of smoke and mirrors going on
with the russian military and then it
might be way weaker than you think
and that the only way that putin
imagined he could win
was to go in quickly and scare ukraine
into surrendering basically
like he needed a surrender
but he didn't get one
because zelinski is too good with
persuasion
and zelensky realized correctly
apparently that if he used persuasion
and you know did the george washington
fighting with the troops you know
leading from the front kind of thing
that he could galvanize the rest of the
world or he had a good chance to
apparently he succeeded
and they could hold off long enough
that russia's army couldn't sustain
so the thinking is that russia doesn't
even have an army
that could fight an army war
they're just flooding the zone and
hoping the bluff works
now i do believe
that russia could level any city it
wanted we all agree with that right
but if they started leveling cities in
ukraine
that's different than chechnya
meaning that the russian citizens are
going to say wait a minute
did you just level the city where my
grandmother lives
did you just level the city where my
friend lives
hold on did you just
level the city where my mother-in-law
lives a real real example
i don't know that they can
and can you imagine holding the country
if you leveled their if you'd level give
imagine holding the country after you
did that
now what would it take for russia to
hold the country
to occupy it and hold it if the country
didn't want to be
you know in their sphere and it was
going to resist what it would take to
hold it
well a military expert
estimated looking at all the different
occupations of different armies across
time
that you need about 20 military
in in that country for every thousand
citizens you're trying to suppress
that's a lot
and it's about 20 times more than russia
has
in other words
the the russian military is maybe an
order of magnitude at least
away from being able to hold the country
so in terms of holding you know grabbing
it and holding it militarily for the
long term
not a chance
there's news in any chance so the only
way they could hold ukraine is to
decapitate the leader
put in a puppet
and hope that the citizens followed the
puppet and you know that they could put
pressure everywhere to make sure that
that happened but they couldn't hold it
the old-fashioned way with power
i'm seeing somebody say so wrong in all
caps
hey you're so wrong guy
the guy that says i'm so wrong in all
caps
um
russia uses threats and persuasion to
hold theories yes yes that it would be a
puppet
plus threats and persuasions and bribes
and all those things that's exactly what
i'm saying
so
you know they wouldn't need an occupying
army if they could get that kind of
cooperation
but i don't know that ukraine is
cooperative
ukraine is looking
pretty independent
so it could be
that
putin has himself in a situation where
he can't win because he doesn't have the
right kind of army to sustain a siege
in fact it would be sort of a race to
see who starves to death first
we'll talk about that in a minute the
russia's army or the the people who are
under siege i'm not sure who would star
first
because it's pretty hard to feed an army
and they're already having problems
reportedly but i don't believe any of
the reports
yeah how many russians couldn't hold
afghanistan exactly that's that's an
example
it just can't be done with small numbers
and they have small numbers
so i'm all over the place here on this
um
so if
if that was the plan russia needs to
either
negotiate its way out
and take what it can get
or it's got to figure something out you
know find another way to win or
something
there are smart people saying the way
this probably ends is with a partition
of ukraine
where the most russian part that's close
to the border russia russia keeps with a
puppet and maybe the rest of it becomes
a neutral country or something like that
i don't know that that's going to fly
so i can't see that big being a thing
but this brings us to that 40 mile
convoy
which some say is a four mile convoy on
a 40-mile road
but other reports say it's actually a
40-mile convoy
now the reports are that the convoy
keeps getting bogged down
so we see reports of you know
ukrainian
citizens blocking the streets and trying
to stop the
tanks from coming in
i don't know that that's going to work
very long
that sounds like something that would
work for
an hour
and maybe if you do an hour at a time it
does make a difference
but
but we're hearing reports that the
russian
convoy is running out of food
running out of
gas and maybe even some of these
soldiers are sabotaging their own gas
tanks
to get out of fighting
now do you believe any of that
well the only thing i believe is that
that 40-mile convoy is going slower than
you'd expect them for reasons we don't
understand that's the only thing we know
i don't necessarily believe
that they're starving or they're out of
fuel
that feels that feels like more of the
ukrainian persuasion doesn't it
sounds like propaganda
could be true
and that's why it works
it works because you think well that
could be true now why do you think that
it could be true that the russian convoy
is running out of
food and
gas why why do you think it could be
true
don't say that it is or is not but why
do you think it could be
because of ukrainian persuasion
the ukrainians have given you a bunch of
anecdotes
of uh of russian soldier incompetence
and lack of training you know they're
showing the construct conscripts calling
home
you know they're showing talking stories
about the
the russian soldiers asking for
directions
from the locals
i don't believe any of those stories
but
if some of those took hold and you
believe that some of those anecdotes
were true
then you buy into the russian army being
so incompetent that they may have gone
on a long convoy without enough gas and
food and no way to get it to them
but i kind of doubt it
i feel like if there's one thing an army
can do well
it's get food and
uh and gas
to the place you need to get it
when you're when it's an uncontested
area
because as far as we know nobody's
attacking the convoy right it's
literally uncontested
on a clear road for miles a clear
straight paved road
and you're telling me that the russians
can't get food and gas in there
again
there's no attack on the convoy
the weather is good enough
it's not great but it's good enough it's
a paved road
and they can't get
provisions it
does that sound real
that doesn't sound real does it
it could be
that they're just taking their time
because there's negotiations going on
and they're just part of the negotiation
because they don't want to flatten or
siege a city
imagine imagine what would happen to the
russian economy if they lay siege to
kiev
think about it
think about
um
yeah think think about the daily stories
coming out of
potentially starvation
inside of kiev
how many days of watching kiev literally
starve to death
how many days like that would we go by
before europe and the rest of the
country maybe even china
just says look russia
we're going to turn off your lights now
like seriously we're just gonna turn off
your lights
so i don't here's the things i think
that putin can't do he's sort of in a
trap
i don't think he can crush kiev
i don't think he can hold the country
with a just an occupation
i don't think it's going to work to put
in a puppet
i think only negotiating works at this
point
and i don't know that the ukrainians are
going to agree to anything
scottish deep state talking points
uh match all they want to say
well sabang
sabong let me talk to you
who sabong here on the comments youtube
says that i have a deep state talking
points
well sabong
um
let me say something about you since
you've said something about me
um
i would say that
maybe you're a good mind reader but
you're not
you're not
could it be
that this is a story that is not simple
like your
simple
shiny smooth marble-like brain
which is probably rolling around in your
skull right now
thinking what the hell is going on
i don't know what's going on now i
thought i could just insult this guy
and he wouldn't even notice
but i did notice
and so let me tell you if the depth of
your political analysis
is that in a complicated story
i sometimes agree with other people
you
are a idiot
now
 idiots are invited to be on
the show i invite everybody it's
it's a free country
but
just some advice
if somebody
and i'm guessing i'm just going to take
a guess here sabang
i'm probably not the first person who
told you you're a idiot am i
am i
i mean i feel like i feel like maybe
your friends have mentioned that a few
times
because you've got that idiot
vibe
you know idiot energy you know
what i mean you know what i mean
so yes
sibong
i will sometimes agree with other people
you know what sabang
do you drink water
sometimes
because hitler did
hail or did
oh so you're just a hitler copycat sabot
drinking water all the time just like
hitler
um i do like to
yeah quit hitting the sabong saban
all right enough on you you're not
important
so putin's trapped he can't really hold
the city he can't siege and starve it he
can't crush it
uh what's he gonna do i think he has to
negotiate
now
here's a situation where i wonder
how machiavellian
are
the united states
people who are in charge of stuff
and let me ask you this
don't you think that our smartest people
in our government and our military
geniuses
don't we know that the worst possible
thing putin could do is keep attacking
ukraine
it's the worst thing he could do for
russia
don't you think maybe on some level
we didn't exactly
trick him into doing it
but didn't we let this happen
am i wrong
i feel like we tricked him into
attacking his own country
putin says that ukraine is russia
we tricked putin
into attacking his own country
and destroying it
it looks like he's going to destroy
russia and ukraine at the same time
which is all the same country
so
again i asked the question
are the
u.s and maybe european military and uh
political minds are they so
machiavellian that they know that they
knew that by supporting ukraine going
into nato
they could cause russia to start a war
with itself
they might even nuke themselves
think about it
i mean if they used a new could probably
be in ukraine right i mean if they were
losing the war i suppose they could
threaten other nato countries with their
nukes but
i think we tricked russia into nuking
itself
and that's not even a joke that's
literally what's happening
i think we truck tricked
russia into nuking itself we definitely
tricked russia into giving up um
its future control of energy
at the moment they still are selling a
lot but i think we tricked them into
destroying their entire economy
or was it a trick did we blunder into
this by luck
or bad luck i know because we don't know
how it's going to work out
but
you know we have all these russian spies
you know our cia has a lot of russian
experts probably too many of them
so they focus on russia too much
i just have a feeling
this might have been a trap
i have a second feeling
that that uh russian convoy
probably has resupply issues i don't
think it's as bad as reported probably
but let me ask you this
if you if you had this 40 mile convoy
and you take out their fuel trucks
that would be bad
but the other thing you have to do that
you could do
you could take out no fuel trucks
let them drive until the fuel trucks
that they have are empty
and then what are they going to have to
do
they're going to have to send another
fuel truck
but the next fuel truck will not be
hidden in a 40-mile convoy
the next fuel truck will be you know
maybe with some
some you know armed
vehicles around it
but it's going to be a small unit
that will be obviously full of gas
do you think the ukrainians have some
facility
in taking out small units of russians
apparently they do
apparently if it's a small group of
russians
as you would imagine guarding a
guarding a truck full of fuel
it would be a smallish group
ukraine can take them out all day long
they just fly their drone over there
wait for the truck bam and they don't
even have to shoot all of the trucks in
the convoy just taking out the fuel
truck and the fuel truck takes down all
the rest
so
could it be that the ukrainians are so
smart
that they said the smartest thing we
could do is let this entire convoy get
into the country
let their fuel let their supply line
stretch by the way
who is the first military
genius who told who told you they might
be intentionally stretching the russian
supply lines
me i still don't know that's true but in
case it is i want to put it out there
that it could be that the ukrainians are
so smart they knew that all they had to
do is pick off the supply chains coming
in and they don't even have to touch the
the rest now you say to yourself yes
scott
but they're still going to have so much
so many military assets
right next to kiev
that they don't even need gas basically
they can just sit there and shoot
and just put the army in flood the zone
have you seen what the ukrainians are
doing to their own streets
they have a barricade on every street
the russian army would have to stop
to clear a barricade
in an area that's the biggest kill zone
anybody ever invented which is uh
high-rise buildings
filled with people who are armed to the
teeth
with molotov cocktails and guns that
were handed out you know aks
and they're gonna have to pause to clear
every obstacle
i don't know that that city can be taken
or it can be starved so that might
happen
um what is
putin's objective well there are two
versions of putin's objective somebody's
asking me here
um
scott is a clown
sonia
sonia
do you know
when uh men
say in all caps
something like you said scott is a clown
when men say that do you know what i
call them
i might call them a dick
might call them an bastard
sometimes those are sort of names that
people typically use for men
when women say things like that
i sometimes use a different word
which i get demonetized for
um
so i'm just gonna say you're a control
freak
that's all
you're just a control freak
a
stupid
control freak
um that's all i'm going to say about
that
so
i'm always impressed by russia's long
game apparently they plan things for
decades
they play on things for decades and one
of the things that they apparently
succeeded at
was persuading the west or the united
states especially not to use
nuclear energy and they also persuaded
germany not to use as much nuclear
energy so that russia could control them
by selling them energy and make a lot of
money
so
do you believe that first of all do you
believe that the reason that uh nuclear
energy was demonized in this country is
not because our left-leaning people
were concerned about it not because they
they had looked into it but entirely
because of russian persuasion
the the evidence is mounting
that the entire russian opinion about
uh the entire opinion about nuclear in
this country was driven by russian
propaganda for years
that's like actually probable i mean
you have to doubt every story at this
point but the evidence suggests it
now
what do you do if russian propaganda
is
destroying your country by making you do
the wrong things
well a very interesting thing happened
in this country didn't
yeah we've talked about how the opinion
about nuclear energy even before the
ukraine situation the opinion about
nuclear energy was negative negative
negative negative negative boom positive
and it happened all in about
one or two years it seems like like you
just ramped and went up
why'd that happen
do you know why
i think it's persuasion
i think that there were people in the
united states michael schellenberg
right and
uh um
and
you know
so i think that people like that and
mark schneider of course
uh
i think that they
they influenced me
and i used my powers of influence to you
know spread their message as much as
possible and i think that between the
the knowledge that they had
and then
if i may say modestly
i feel like i've trained an army of
persuaders
would you say that's true
so so give me a give me an ego check
here in case i'm over claiming
i feel like by doing the show for the
last several years i've trained people
to
recognize propaganda better
recognize fake news better but also to
persuade better
and i think that the
sort of collective energy from that
may have made a difference you know
maybe
maybe russia propaganda for 20 years got
broken
just by
some citizens
who could see past it and could
penetrate it no i'm not saying like you
know three people i mentioned
did it all
but they did a lot
they did a lot i think it could have
been the difference
it could have easily been the difference
because remember these are people who
whose influence reached all the way to
congress
right i mean they literally talked to
congress michael schellenberger in
particular
so
i think they made a difference
so when you're looking at the military
you're looking at national defense
we always make the mistake of ignoring
economics and now energy
we should have always been thinking that
our economy and our energy production
are just part of the defense program
and i would argue that space
needs to be in that category too
all of our space stuff is really
national defense in disguise that's all
it is
so i think if we were clear-eyed
we would have known from the beginning
that nuclear energy had some risks
everything does but the the new versions
the ver the
the uh
what do you call it the uh
the third version of the uh nuclear
plants that we build now none of them
have ever melted down
modern technology even before generation
four yeah generation three
the one that would currently be built
there's a little generation 4 going on
but even generation 3 has literally had
no meltdowns
they just work
now there is some risk
that they might
but even generation 4 will take care of
that
all right energy has always been part of
national security but i think maybe
the ukraine situation
takes it to another level i i would
agree with you that it's always been in
the conversation but a weak part of the
conversation
does scott cover for the wef by
attacking anyone who brings it up
well kevin
in all caps
i don't even know what you're talking
about
i can't even insult you
uh yeah the wef wants to have control
over our lives i get that
um
so
here's what i think is going to happen
in the next two or three days if ukraine
can hold out
i think we'll have an answer to the
question
of
whether
kiev will starve before the russian army
starves
now of course both of them have the
advantage that they could get supplies
by air
right
but neither have air superiority we're
told
could the ukrainians shoot out of the
air any
any uh let's say
any airplanes that were trying to
deliver food to the army of russia
you know the air airlifting food
do you think the ukrainians could shoot
those few
transport things what would you call
them cargo cargo planes how hard is it
to shoot a cargo plane out of the sky
is it easy
i don't know i mean it would have
probably a fleet of other planes
protecting it and stuff somebody said
this is not easy
i don't know
because they would be higher up until
they drop their cargo is that why
i don't really know why it depends on
height somebody says
so i'm not so sure that russia can do an
air drop of supplies at least
conveniently or well enough to make a
difference
and i don't know that we could get food
into kiev either
so who's gonna i hate to say it but this
is gonna be a question of who starves to
death isn't it
and who freezes
am i right
that the war is down to who starves to
death
because i think it is
so let me make this my prediction that
this will be a
supply chain war in the end
that whichever side has a better supply
chain
ironically
the better supply chain is going to be
the one that doesn't starve and they're
the ones who can wait it down longer
but i think in the meantime there'll
probably be some negotiated settlement i
would guess
or
somebody will take out putin in their
own country
i i would be surprised if there's
actually that much pushback within
putin's inner circle or even the
or
within the earnings i would say that
the billionaires are probably pretty mad
because this is costing them serious
money
it would be real interesting to see if
any of the oligarchs go bankrupt
i don't know if that's possible
but imagine if one prominent oligarch
like literally just went bankrupt
lost everything
that would get their attention wouldn't
it
i don't think we're close to that but
maybe
um
so there is a weird ironic if that's the
right word it probably isn't possibility
that russia will lose the war because of
a lack of gas
that could actually happen
russia could lose the war
because of a lack of gas
that's a real thing
you know the their entire advantage was
that they had fuel that they're the you
know main source to europe
but it's possible
they will lose the war because they
don't have enough gas
that would be the sort of perfect moving
ending i guess
um
all right i guess we've got to talk
about the state of the union that did
any of you watch it i asked on locals
and almost nobody did
uh all right so on
youtube
and locals
did anybody watch the biden
speech
okay we got a few yeses
all right
well here are the highlights according
to
uh other people uh of course all the
biden-friendly people like jake tapper
and
van jones um were saying things like
jake said it was very solid and van
jones declared uncle joe is back
and there was him quote at his best
how many of you
felt that it was biden at his
best is uncle joe back
did you get that feeling
no
all right
so um
and i guess jennifer rubin who of course
is just a pro-democrat
uh she said biden delivered claiming his
speech was more bipartisan than one
could have imagined how many of you
thought it was bipartisan
did anybody hear that and say you know
that's more bipartisan than i imagined
not so much
late show host
stephen colbert
described it as the state union speech
as a rollercoaster ride of rip roaring
reasonableness
does it sound like rip-roaring
reasonableness
no actually that's one that is one thing
that
biden is good at biden is good at
sounding reasonable which is different
than being effective but he's actually
good at sounding reasonable even when
he's not
so apparently he came out in a
full-throated way to be against
defunding the police
that would be bipartisan um
well
sort of bipartisan his own party doesn't
like it as much
but he said it clearly i'll give him
credit for that
um he said that inflation is robbing
america give him credit for that he
didn't use the words build back better
because apparently he thinks he might
only get some parts of that now
so i guess i guess that went away partly
and
so uh i guess he announced that
we'll be closing u.s airsport airspace
to russian planes how many russian
planes were in american airspace in the
first place
it was only i assume it was only flights
back and forth to america
so
i'm not so sure
that that makes a big difference how
many people were traveling back and
forth to russia anyway
but um credit card countries and oil
companies are pulling out apple apple
stop selling products imagine having an
apple phone
or apple products and never being able
to get a replacement
or
a part
that's really going to make the public
pretty mad
so
i don't think anybody knows
if the sanctions are going to be enough
but we've never seen this kind of
sanctions have we
i feel as though as long as putin is in
charge
the ukrainian persuasion has just
destroyed russia
because the ukrainians and the us have
made
putin look like such a hitler-like
character
that i don't know that any big country
can go back and do business with them
ever again
if if apple is waiting
for you know if they're just playing for
time
and they're thinking oh when this blows
over and we consolidate control over
ukraine
everybody still needs energy so they're
going to do business with us again
i don't think so
i i think china i think russia is
actually done
as an economically viable entity as long
as putin's there
what do you think
now
keep in mind that even you know
the top economists don't really know
what's going to happen there it's not
knowable
we had similar sanctions against iran
but iran was already a little bit
isolated it was a different situation
am i right
i think russia has way more
international connections that they
require
i might be wrong about that
um
are economists ever sure about anything
no
they're not
yeah we will keep buying oil from them
apparently now the fact that biden did
not say we were going to
uh get our domestic energy production
back online
just that's like not even trying
that is so not even trying
apparently
so there's something happening
interesting with
russian oil
now the price of oil went through the
roof
and so you say to yourself wait
that just enriches russia russia because
the more expensive the oil is
the more they make
to fund their army
but i need a fact check on this because
i may have read something wrong
but it looked to me like nobody's buying
the russian oil
and that the price of russian
crude this is not the gas but just the
oil the the price of russian crude is
actually uh just falling off a table
because nobody wants to take the risk of
transporting it
do you think that's true
i feel like there's so much hunger for
oil that they're gonna find a place to
sell it to
right but at the moment
whether or not they find a place to sell
it at the moment the risk profile is so
high that they can't seem to ship it out
at a price that people are willing to
pay
so they actually are losing money on oil
compared to where they were they didn't
gain money they're losing oil
i feel like russia's economy
is
just right on the edge
and maybe already
because again we don't know how strong
it was in the first place it wasn't that
strong
um
and like i said biden said that uh covet
is not controlling us and get back to
work and he wants you to go back and
fill it fill out the great downtowns
again to which i say
stop telling us to do that
that's not your job
it's not biden's job to tell me if i
should commute or work from home
that is way over the line
how about i will decide where i work and
you
will just go do whatever you do in your
little white house
how about you leave me alone
how about that
how about after this
freaking pandemic
how about the public doesn't really want
to get pushed around anymore
maybe we're
maybe we're done with the government
telling us what to do if it's not
strictly on the constitution
maybe if every word of it isn't in the
constitution off because we're a
little bit tired of being told what to
do and i certainly don't want to be told
to commute two hours a day
for what
for what
biden
who's that good for
um
scott thinks russia forgot how to supply
an army
sonia
sonia in all caps
she says scott thinks russia forgot how
to supply an army
does that sound like what i just said
sonia
is that why you heard sonia
because
pretty sure they do know how
but you know what else
i think the ukrainians know how to stop
it
of course they know how to supply an
army but nobody knows how to supply an
army when their supply line is caught
all right
uh yeah i think a lot of you like sony
are just russian bots that's true
probably
probably
what will we say when russia wins
ukraine and ukraine his question what
will we say
well we'll say that's what the military
told us would happen
let me ask you something
let me ask you something
um
just looking at your comments for a
moment
i i think the all caps people are all
you're all uh
can we have a vote here
are are the people writing at me in all
caps
are they all trolls they're all bots
right
could we have a filter that just uh
blocked anything that's in all caps
oh my god
how much do you want that
there's no filter to block somebody who
writes all caps how much do you want
that
i would pay for that
i would actually pay for it
if you said i'll pay
three dollars a month
then nobody can write at me with all
caps
i'd pay three dollars a month
come on where's that feature
now you don't want to
be
ignorant that the message was sent
what you want is for an automatic reply
to say uh
messages in all caps
are not taken seriously you've been
blocked
but i guess you couldn't be blocked if
you're responding back well you know
what i mean something like that
ask for it in locals
you've recruited you recruited 20 people
to buy
over on the locals platform they just
went to all capitals
i'm seeing a sea of capital letters on
locals apparently they're
all the rogues and the rebels are on
locals
so
it turns out that in addition to not
wanting biden to tell you what to do it
it turns out that my followers don't
want me to tell what to do either
apparently i'm not telling anybody what
to do
i think america is done with being told
what to do
and that's why i love america
that's why i love america
because we're very flexible
until we're not
that's
that's uh that's how i see the united
states
we're very flexible super flexible
until we're
not right um
the the people in the lower case are the
rogues now
all right
this piece would be one of our defining
features
so how many uh
how many mandates are left in the united
states from covid we've got uh
flying still right
you still need your mask for flying has
that has it been announced that there's
an end date to the flying masks
that's crazy isn't it
that's crazy
now i believe is it uh
was it in canada that the health care
workers
can get their jobs back if they're
unvaccinated
and in the united states
we should have a list of the remaining
mandates
and dates that they're coming off
now i predicted that mandates
would come off and that it was temporary
and so far i think i'll be right
but it's taken a lot longer than i
thought so i'm wrong about that
yeah public transport still needed
so here's my
experience from yesterday
every place i went yesterday in
california people were wearing masks
except me
my town is still fully masked
except me
right now i say fully it's more like
half to 50 or something but there's a
lot of masks here in in settings that
make no sense
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
is everything i wanted to tell you
except that apparently biden
referred to the ukrainian people as the
iranian people
not his best moment
or as chris eliza said
well we know what he meant
as he's up there inspiring confidence
that he knows which country
is at war
and
in russia pot smokes you okay
i do live in a very blue city
true thing
um
oh you
so somebody said they took their mask
off when they were exiting the airport
you know before they got to the exit
under the theory what are they going to
do kick you out of the airport
you're leaving the airport
actually that's pretty smart
if you're leaving the airport
let's say you're you've got your bags
already
you should definitely take off your mask
because again what are they going to do
kick you out the door is just right over
there you're walking toward it
i mean at the very least it would it
would signal to other people
that there's not a danger you know it
would just sort of get them used to it
so it might be a good idea
actually it might be a good idea
anywhere
to take off your mask when you're
heading for the exit
um
pilots laid off for refusing the
vaccination just want a lawsuit and
we'll get back pay somebody saying in
the comments i don't have a source for
that so
um
all right
uranium
all right that's all i got yes we still
need mass in healthcare but i don't
think that's going to change right away
and i will talk to you
youtube
