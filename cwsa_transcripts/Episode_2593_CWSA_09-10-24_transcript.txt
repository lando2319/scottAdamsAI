we'll keep an eye on that but in the
meantime whoa what a show what a show we
have for
you you're going to be so
happy all right let me get my comments
going
here good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need is a cuper mug or glass a
tankered chalice or Stein a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of anyine fill it
with your favorite liquid I do like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go well the first story of the day is
that uh according to studies moderate
amounts of caffeine can improve your
cognitive function specifically areas
like memory attention and problem
solving what does all that
mean modern I'm not connecting these
like moderate amounts of
caffeine something about cognitive
function I don't really understand any
of
that oh wait now I understand it oh my
God I didn't think it would work that
quickly is there anything coffee can't
do
no well if you're watching the Dilbert
reborn comic strip you'd have to be a
subscriber to do that either on locals
or on X you would know that Wall-E has
been asked to wear a robot costume
because their robot prototype is not
ready yet so Wall-E will be dressed as a
robot so that's what you're missing if
you're not
subscribing early this morning the
SpaceX rocket called Polaris
successfully launched with four human
beings in it uh it's going to reach the
highest Earth orbit ever and there's
going to be some commercial space walks
and all kinds of fun and it
worked I I think we're getting used to
the fact that Elon Musk can put people
in space we we're starting to think oh
that's normal no this is
extraordinary and no matter how many
times it happens you just take just a
moment to appreciate the Wonder of that
as JD Vance was saying um at the uh
all-in pod event
uh that America is not as Innovative as
it looks because we're mostly innovating
with
software but not musk musk is innovating
with hardware and I think the computer
um I'm sorry I think the robot age is
going to be a lot more
physical manufacturing kind of
capabilities coming on board if if only
because a robots are doing the
manufacturing and building manufacturing
plants well there's a study that's
written about in medical express some
researchers at the MRC brain Network
Dynamics unit in Oxford's Newfield
Department of clinical newor giant damn
it don't make the name of your group
that
big you you you can't do this you can't
do this you cannot call yourself the MRC
brain Network Dynamics unit in Oxford's
nuffield Department of clinical
neurosciences too long too
long anyway what they discovered was um
that um there's part of your brain that
prevents new flexible memories from
being formed if you have robust
long-term memories in other words the
memories you already have kind of
hardcoded in your head will interfere
with your ability to perceive and
correctly store new
memories probably cost him a lot of
money to organize this study Al Bet it
took a lot of time
you know what they could have done to
save some money and some time they could
have just asked me Scott do you think
that the things that are already in your
head are in any way going to influence
how well you perceive and remember new
inputs and I would have said well you
don't need to study that calm down you
don't need to study that we already know
that first impressions are hard to shake
we already know that the whole point of
cognitive dis is that you'd rather come
up with a fantasy than change what you
believe to be true so I don't even think
you need to study this yes the things
that are already in your brain will
definitely filter and affect what you
can put into it next I guarantee
it and now a validation of what I've
been calling the uh the Adams law of
slow moving disasters now the Adams law
of slow moving disaster states that
human are really good like we're really
good and unbroken you know hundred
hundreds of thousands of years of
experience in solving problems that you
can see coming from a long way off we're
not so good if something surprises us
like a pandemic but if we see something
coming and everybody sees it coming and
there's no doubt it's coming we're
pretty good at it here's an
example the you know that Great Pacific
Garbage Patch that's a lot of plastic
it's like the size of I don't know the
size of some small country and is
floating around the ocean well
apparently for 7.5 billion dollars uh
the ocean cleanup group says they can uh
clean it up so apparently we don't need
to invent anything new and it's not so
expensive that we couldn't do it if we
want to so we now have the technology to
just sort of clean it up there you go
another problem not solved but we have
all the tools to solve it we you know if
somebody wants to put the money into
it that might be the problem it might be
more the money
problem um people keep asking me Scott
why don't you use AI to make your audio
books and I kept saying
incorrectly that audible the main place
that people get their
audiobooks uh used to have a rule
against that you couldn't you couldn't
have ai um read your book has an
audiobook but now they've gone the other
way in fact they're encouraging it in
within specific uh boundaries but it
looks like I can do that now so um
probably in the next several months I'll
do that with a few more books um I've
already got the audio book with a human
a human is doing it uh for uh God's be
the complete works and
for I think for wind bigley that should
come out soon
anyway
um there's a Civil War in Mexico with
the caloa
cartel so the caloa cartel has decided
to kill each other more often than
killing other
people all good good for them keep it up
Apple made an announcement uh about
their new new phones and new software so
AI will be in their new
phones and I I was prepared not to
be enticed by it I thought I was going
to hear that you know AI had been added
to the iPhone and I'd say ah doesn't
seem like it's going to be that
different really but I have to say their
advertisement sold me I'm definitely
going to upgrade my phone now I used to
own a bunch of Apple stock but I don't
anymore because I have less confidence
that they can navigate the AI future but
so far
at least in a smallish way uh they have
so one of the things their new AI
enhanced phone will do is you can point
it at anything and it'll tell you about
it now I guess maybe I have to push a
button but if you point your phone at uh
an object it'll give you directions on
how to use the
object using AI now that's pretty
impressive or it'll give you like a
history if you're walking somewhere you
could or or you if you wanted to know
what the menu is in the restaurant you
just take a picture of the front of the
restaurant as you walk by menu will pop
up on your phone that's pretty good
stuff but now don't you want that in
your
glasses I I've had this dream
forever that uh someday the fact that I
have to wear
glasses will become so Universal that
everybody will be wearing glasses and it
won't look unusual anymore
because you want to get that little
extra knowledge in your glasses so I
wouldn't mind if my glasses were doing
nothing but send the image send the
image to my phone and then my phone
could send something to my ear and say
hey you're looking at that restaurant
you want to know the menu
sure so I think they're going to do well
in that um my prediction is good sales
for the future uh Apple
products um there's some kind of a
traffic incident with a football star i'
never heard of plays for the Dolphins
Tyreek
Hill and I don't even need to tell you
what happened do
I see if you can guess there was a
traffic incident in which a football
star was
stopped what do you think happened
next do you think the football star
totally coop operated with the police
and there was a plight encounter and
maybe a small infraction for not having
a seat Bel
on no it turned
into uh somebody resisting every request
from the police until they had to drag
him out of the car and put him on the
concrete and now the body cam shows the
whole thing and everybody's talking
about it and uh I'd like to say for the
record I don't care if police kill every
single person who resists arrest
that's where I'm at I don't care if
they're a football
star I don't care if it's a member of my
family okay that's a lie I do care if
it's a member of my family but the
police can kill everybody who resists
arrest if they if they don't have a
reason they were literally just trying
to make a dangerous situation for the
police if you're a police officer and
somebody won't put their hands where you
can see them and won't get out of the
car you're going to have to assume
they've got a weapon in there and that
they're going to die in the next few
minutes and you might
too every time that happens if the
police go crazy on that motorist for
resisting arrest especially if it's on
the cam I mean the the body cams made it
pretty clear who the problem
was I have no problem with that with
whatever the police do that that
no problem at
all
anyway uh Lex fridman is his his head is
being messed up he said because he
learned that u k Harris's father's
actual legal name is Donald J Harris so
you got Donald J
Trump running against the daughter of
Donald J Harris he thinks the universe
is trolling him well it's even better
than
that we've had a president Trump once
before but we've also had a president
Harrison not Harris but
Harrison do you remember president
Harrison what's the most famous thing
about President Harrison does anybody
know he was the ninth
president first of all how many how many
of you would have even remember there
was a president
Harrison I have to admit I had to look
it up I was saying to myself isn't there
already a president Harris but it's
Harrison and here's what you need to
know about him he was an American
military officer
he was president in 1841 and he lasted
uh 32 days in
office he was dead in 32 days oh well he
was the first to die in office shortest
tenure in US presidential history
now here's something interesting too
technically KL Harris was President of
the United States already goes under the
uh whatever rule it is when the
president goes under anesthesia which
happened once with Biden so kble Harris
was actually the president for about 25
minutes so there's another weird
coincidence the other weird coincidence
is that the most famous thing about
Trump is his
hair and he's running against somebody
with his first name and middle initial
and Harris I mean all of it just seems
like it can't be a coincidence it feels
like a bad writer ran out of ideas and
just started reusing zo now I realize
he's not running against the father but
you know what I
mean all right here's a little glimpse
of the Joy Reed
reality the post millennial was uh
pointing this out on X so this is
something that Joy Reed just said I
think yesterday quote despite how
exhausting and deadly the Trump era
was
what the Trump era was exhausting and
deadly what
she goes on and how it devastated Our
Lives
what what did your life get devastated I
don't remember it devastating my life I
mean not because of trump it was the
pandemic was bad so it devastated Our
lives our psyches our
families
really did any of that happened to you
man I know people's families got mad at
him be but it wasn't because of trump
because of the media our
economy tens of millions of Americans
our fellow Americans want to go back to
that era and it makes no sense to me and
probably not to you
either imagine living in this completely
batshit crazy reality where everybody
could see that Trump destroyed the
United States and your family and your
psyche and your mental health and your
your finances and your wallet and still
still according to poly Market Trump is
up 50 to 46 that's a betting
markets now how would you explain that
if you're Joy Reed trying to figure out
how reality makes
sense how could she not have mental
illness with this point of view she's
living in a world in which nothing makes
sense do you know why none of it makes
sense it's because MSNBC is lying to the
people so
grotesquely that she bought into the
whole MSNBC narrative and now she can't
Square it with
reality because reality is telling you
that more people want Trump again than
Harris but that's opposite of the
reality that they've been living in and
creating for the public for
years that would actually make you crazy
like actually
legitimately real life you're going to
have to go to a therapist you been if
you've been living in that fake reality
and then the facts are so opposite and
you look at them and you go
um why do tens of millions of people not
see it the way I see
it
anyway meanwhile the Department of
Homeland Security is giving another $380
million to illegal
immigrants what is the total amount that
has been spent on bringing people in
that we should not have been bringing in
the last few years how many billions are
we up to I mean when you look at the
entire that is probably not a big
percentage but that's a lot of
billions a lot of
billions
and it's hard to imagine that there's
any good intention to any of that I I I
think I've abandoned
any pretense that somebody was just
trying to do what's good for the world
that clearly is not the intention behind
any of this now there might be some
individuals who are thinking of it that
way but certainly not from the you know
the uh government perspective this is an
OP of some sort now Elon Musk says it's
just to bring in more voters to get a
permanent Democrat majority I don't have
a better
suggestion I don't have a stronger idea
than that but you'd have to throw into
the possibility that it's coming from
another country that some other country
has some kind of control that we're not
completely aware of and their intention
is to destroy our country because if our
own country is actively destroying our
country then my reality doesn't make
sense so I'm I don't really have a model
where everything makes sense yet I'm not
quite buying into that the only reason
is the Democrats are trying to get a
bunch of illegal
voters although they're clearly planning
to do that too I I would say it's 100%
sure that that's part of it I just don't
know if it's all of it
I'll tell you the part that I don't
think is any of it is
empathy I don't think that's behind any
of it although there are individuals you
know doing real work on the ground who
are empathy based but not from the
management organizational funding
perspective that's not about empathy so
we'll find out anyway the big debate is
tonight I'm planning
to uh live stream that for my local
subscribers uh we'll watch that together
it'll give you some feedback about that
but let me tell you uh what to
expect so some insiders are saying that
Harris is planning to use her
prosecutorial skills against Trump and
make him look like the uh the convict
you know the lawbreaking convict and
she's the
lawbringer I don't think that works and
I'm not entirely sure that that quote
leak from the inside was a real leak or
a fake
leak I almost think they might be trying
to trick Trump into being mentally
prepared for the wrong thing I don't
think they could really be this dumb to
think that being sort of a you know
prosecutor personality when you're
running for president in this context
when Trump has lots of ammo to use
against that I don't see that that's a
good play
and since we've seen that her advisers
are you know I've been saying it for a
while now um her current advisors are
way above average they're really good
now when it comes to the debate it might
be different people influencing
different things so we don't know if
it's the same level of smart people
doing everything or not but you could
imagine that they would be smart enough
to do a fake leak and say yeah she's
going to go all prosecutor and then
maybe she goes a different direction so
that's the first thing to look for is
was that a fake leak or a real leak I
don't know but I'm going to lean toward
fake so I'm going to say 6040 that was
never
real all right so 40 is still a lot that
it is real but I'm going to lean against
it 6040 that that was a fake
leak all right so the things we know
that uh is likely that Harris will bring
up as her attacks on Trump would be the
bodily autonomy argument he only cares
about himself not the country he's
stealing your democracy and January 6
was an
Insurrection and she'll tell you that
she's uh her policies might have been a
little vague but she's very clear on her
values and that Trump is a big old
liar now does Trump have good uh
responses to each of these
potentially so he has a Kill Shot for
every one of the attacks just total kill
shots will he use them
no why I don't know I don't know they
they all they're all easily killed but
Trump is Trump and he'll have his he'll
probably do whatever he's done before
which is just say what he wants to
say but he has a kill shot every one of
these is a soft underbelly situation for
example on the bodily autonomy they're
going to say you're trying to make you
know women not do this or do this about
abortion or uh or uh birth control and
Trump's going to say uh well if you
watch the real news you'd know that I've
taken myself completely out of those
decisions and that's the way I prefer it
is there anybody here watching today who
thinks I should be involved in your
healthc care decisions anybody anybody
in the audience do you think I should be
involved in your healthare decisions no
I don't think so either so that's why
the Supreme Court who I agreed with
moved it to the states so that you can
be closer to that decision your
government that's closest to you and if
women by a majority want the laws to be
one way or the other that's the way it's
going to go and that's what I created I
created a situation where you can get
what you want and take me completely out
of the decision now where's the bodily
autonomy argument when I've taken myself
completely out of the decision and I
hope future presidents do the
same that's a kill
shot that is an absolute
devastating sword through the
heart end of
story will he do that no I don't think
he will I I think he'll say what he
always says which is you know I got it
you know I think you'll say nobody
wanted Rover's way to be you know the
way it was at the federal level which is
just not true and then they'll say I
accomplish this which only makes
Republicans happy doesn't get any new
votes I don't think he's going to kill
that question but he could I mean it's
right there for him to take if he wants
to now I I wonder if the reason he
doesn't take that approach is that it
would be giving too much oxygen to the
um pro-abortion people to say well if
you organize you can get anything you
want maybe that's too much but you can
soften that by saying you know it's
closer to the will of the people you
don't have to go any further than
that she's going to say that he only
cares about himself not the country
here's a Kill Shot for
that what do you exactly mean by I only
care about
myself in What scenario could I do a bad
job for the country and that would work
out well for me
and we're done now you'd have you'd
probably say more than that but that's a
Kill Shot can you describe a scenario in
which the most visible job in the
world in which I'll be bringing in
people who weren't even Republicans
until you know they weren't even on my
side like RFK Jr and you know you're
going to see some people who weren't
even on my side who are going to be
watching very closely from the inside
the outside I know every phone call I
make as multiple people listening I know
that there's no privacy when you're
president not
really so I want everybody to
watch and I don't have any option even
hypothetically where I could do things
that are good for me and bad for the
country nor would I want to because
what's good for me what's good for the
Trump brand in the future what's good
for my family what's good for my
children is that I do the best job I
could possibly be do and you all know
that you all know that that the only way
I can win is if you win
big that's the kill shot it it just
erases that that objection that he's in
it for himself because it doesn't make
sense and you you can instead of saying
it doesn't make sense you could just put
it in the form of a question and make
people say okay how would that make
sense what would be a scenario in which
he could get away with that
all
right say he's stealing your democracy I
think he's got about 10 examples where
the Democrats are stealing democracy
everything from packing the Supreme
Court which they do want to do to get
away of the filibuster which they do
want to do to uh rigging their primary
so that RFK Jr couldn't be in it and
only Biden would be there until they
replaced them without any kind of votes
for KL Harris so the stealing democracy
argu
when you add on the fake news that
supports it all is very strongly on
Trump's side he just has to make the
case then she's going to say January 6
was an Insurrection and again he could
say let me tell you something about
Republicans they don't go to an
Insurrection without guns now you're
going to say some people had some guns
and some cars or whatever but they left
them
there that the fact that they had access
to them and they still didn't use them
is my point not your point do you get
that because they always say well but so
and so had some gun
nearby right and they chose not to use
it that that's my argument not your
argument that that they didn't think it
was an Insurrection and by the way how
do you conquer a country by by
sauntering if I saunter in your building
a little bit do I get to own the
country can can we conquer the uh
conquer Russia if we can get a few
trespassers in there to saunter around
and move some assets maybe a little
graffiti we can conquer Russia why
didn't Ukraine think of that you know
what's Ukraine doing with all this you
know battling on the front when all they
had to do is get a trespasser into the
Kremlin totally own that place now
that's too uh too weird you wouldn't say
that but the point is that uh the
argument against it being an
Insurrection and then the strongest part
is that nobody was charged with
Insurrection the strongest argument is
like number one this was the most
heavily investigated event in American
history and nobody was charged with
Insurrection because there was
none the news told you there was because
the news is not real what we were trying
to do is postpone the uh certification
because it looked to us and here's the
party needs to say
I don't think he'll say this but this is
the killshot it looked to us because it
was such a uh
historically um unexpected result a lot
of the Belle weather places went the
wrong directions at the last minute he
said whether it was true or not this
would be the this would be the important
part whether it was true or
not I and the people who were active at
that event thought that it was too
suspicious just to let go without
challenging you want Americans to
challenge those things that look like
they need to be challenged if you're
telling me you don't want an America
that would have gathered around the
capital to challenge what looked like
again we don't know the reality of it at
the base but it looked illegitimate and
honestly people it still looks
illegitimate to me
today you want people to challenge that
peacefully like I told them to you don't
want to live in an America where people
will just take that for granted that
that things don't look like a real
election and we just accept it no we're
going to make some
noise if the election looks like it's
rigged to all of us I mean all of us on
one
side but it needs to be
peaceful and we hope the courts can work
out that sort of thing and we're going
to try really hard to have more
observers and uh we're we're we're doing
a much better job of making sure as it's
happening that the election goes right
that's a pretty good
answer um of course now uh KL Harris has
put up on her website her policies some
people say they're too
vague um but one of her one of her
surrogates was saying on I think it was
CNBC that her values are crystal clear
she's crystal clear and her
values is she all right let's let's test
that um some video was
found uh well some evidence was found on
the for the k files on
CNN uh they found out that she had once
filled out a ACLU questionnaire in 2019
this is KL Harris in which she said she
was in favor of uh our government paying
for transition surgery for illegal
aliens uh I I think even in detention
I'm not sure how bad it was
um so does she still believe
that that still where she's at she
wanted to cut funding for
ice how do you explain that your values
are the same but you went from cutting
funding for ice to increasing border
security I don't think this whole
crystal clear in her values things well
I think what she's crystal clear about
is that her only value is winning
elections that seems pretty
clear anyway let's talk about the
biggest story of the day our Haitians
eating
cats okay
to just give you some background on this
so yesterday I talked about this story
for the first time the uh allegations on
social media mostly that uh some of the
Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating
cats and Ducks from the
park now you might remember my first
impression was that doesn't sound true
it's a little too a little too perfectly
crafted on the nose to be a true story
now I'm not going to rule
out that you know one or two people did
exactly that maybe but I certainly do
rule out that it's some kind of a
large event that they're working on in
Ohio you know and so there's been
evidence that the at least the law
enforcement people are not aware of any
big problem with pets being eaten now
again doesn't mean it happened zero
times I'm just saying it's it's not like
a big wave of pet eating crime but as a
recreational belief it is
hilarious it it's in the same category
of you know JD Vance and the
couch yeah we know it's not true but
it's fun to say because it really
bothers the other
side if they think that you think it's
true then it's even
funnier so I don't think you can treat
this one as true but if you're going to
treat it as recreationally
true you know just have fun with it so
I've noticed that all the memes that
involve cats and Trump and saving
animals and stuff every one of them is
hilarious and now there's another
dancing one where he's dancing with a
cat and it's hilarious from from start
to finish I just watch that thing and
just scream it's just so funny watching
him dance with a cat and saving your cat
there's now a commercial about how he's
going to save your
animals every part of this is absolutely
perfectly hilar ious Trump plus
cats is just your perfect fish out of
water doesn't make sense but it does
your brain is trying to reconcile it but
it can't it's just got everything that
makes it recreationally
interesting um but I will tell you that
just for fun because it's recreationally
interesting in my comic strip dilber
there is a main character who is the
head of Human Resources who is a cat
named
catbert and in the dilber comic
um later next week you're going to see
cat bur is invited to a elbonian
immigrant
barbecue and uh well I'll say no more
I'll say no
more invited to an elbonian immigrant
barbecue so wait for that it's only for
subscribers on x on
locals um Elon Musk was at the all-in
Pod and made some news with a few things
he's predicted that uh he was in the
all-in Pod uh live event uh not not just
the podcast he was at the live event and
uh he said that by
2030 uh Optimist human Optimus human
robots those are the ones that he's
making will be they'll be making a
million million of them a year at the C
to $20,000 each because everybody's
going to want a robot Body Buddy and
ultimately there'll be more robots than
people I agree there will be more robots
than people that does seem quite
likely um I don't know about the price
I'd be surprised if he HS the price
point but he's pretty good at that so
probably
will I can't wait to get my robot
they're going to have to do a lot better
with AI than they're doing doing now but
maybe maybe we'll see uh I'll be first
in line to get
one well let's see um the you know I
mentioned that k files thing about the
ACLU questionnaire and the the part that
I left out which is maybe the more
important part is that CNN gave it some
really good attention and Aaron
Bernett was so shocked by learning that
uh Harris had one said that she was in
favor of taxpayer funded gender
transition surgery for detained migrants
not even the ones who have you know got
into the country and they're living the
life still
[Laughter]
detained and eron brunett talking to the
k files guy who's part of their um part
of CNN's investigative team uh she
actually said this she goes taxpayer
funded gender transitions surgeries for
detained migrants she actually said she
report she's so even Aaron Bernett
couldn't believe the reporting on
CNN as she was sitting right next to the
investigative reporter she had to ask
for clarification if she was even
hearing this
right and he
clarified yes it's in writing and we
have more than one
source yes she actually literally said
those
things so if CNN is shaking its head and
saying seriously you actually said that
like in the real world in a public way
you actually said you're in favor of
taxpayer funded gender transition for
detained
migrants really
really that's CNN so does CNN think she
needs to go or is CNN just finding the
middle and and that's the whole story
they they're just finding the middle and
that's something that's worth saying I
don't know it's kind of confusing over
there I I I think maybe it's some kind
of mix of more than one thing some
people trying to find the middle and
other people definitely
not anyway
um
[Music]
so all the all Harris says about uh the
border on her new website of policies is
that she wants to bring back the
bipartisan
bill now of course the bipartisan bill
story uh depends on Democrats not
understanding the news that's the whole
play if Democrats actually ever got real
news they would know that the bipartisan
bill you know had in it and
that's why it was turned down it wasn't
a good idea it was bipartisan in the
sense that there was a a little
Committee of bipartisan and people who
worked on it but it wasn't bipartisan in
terms of General Republicans thinking it
was a good idea it was never never in
that category so that's just a lie
supported by the news the fake
news CNN also had uh Paul Lenton their
their their polling data guy um and he
was saying that uh if KL Harris loses
Pennsylvania she's likely to lose the
race and you know likewise for for Trump
so Pennsylvania is turning out to be
like the main thing so if you win or
lose Pennsylvania that might be the
whole race and as Paul enton points out
and again it's on CNN so this is what
makes it news because you don't expect
them necessarily to say anything that's
going to be anti-h heris prot Trump but
uh Paul Lon to his credit of been
watching him for a while and he does
just give you the
news and every time I I get surprised by
it I I have to like slap myself and say
no Paul Anon so far I've been watching
him for a while seems like a legitimate
credible news related person and uh I
actually completely trust him now he did
that in the context of CNN he got me to
completely trust his opinion that's
pretty good I mean that has to be that
has to be noted that's that's pretty
good and what he says which I think
you'll agree with that if K Harris loses
Pennsylvania there's going to be a lot
of questions about why she didn't pick
their governor Shapiro as a running mate
when he has a 59% approval in
Pennsylvania which I do think would have
been close to a guarantee of her
winning at least Pennsylvania do you
know why she didn't pick Shapiro
identity
Politics the big weakness of the
Democrats is that they have to look at
race more than they look at anything
else and I do think that they were
worried that he was Jewish and therefore
he wouldn't get enough
support so they
literally lost the
race in service of identity maybe now if
she wins a race all that goes away and
certainly a lot of people are expecting
that the election will be so rigged that
she'll win no matter what she does which
by the
way um is a reasonable possibility I I
can't
shake what Brett Weinstein said recently
on podcast might have been Joe Rogan
that we're at a place where Trump could
just win the election
outright and then the news could tell
you he lost
and then the government would act on the
news it wouldn't act on the reality
because that is the reality and then
they would just put Harris in the
office as if she won and then when
anybody brought it up they treat it like
the Wuhan
lab what Wuhan lab you know I mean we're
trying to get down to the you know did
the Wuhan lab was it the source of the
the virus leak H yeah maybe I'll put
some people together and to you about
that next week well you can't talk about
it now oh let me let me research that
get back to you next week next week
comes H we decided we don't want to talk
to
you you you could just ignore topics
that you don't like and we've seen it
now a number of times we can see that
the news can simply create reality so
they could and and this is the shocking
part if you don't think they could do
this you've been missing the big story
they could tell you that the person who
lost won the election even if the
numbers that they reported were the
opposite they could just tell you it was
the other way around and most of the
country wouldn't check and would just
accept it and would be okay with jailing
people who disagreed with the election
result we we are there if you don't
think that's completely possible and has
been tested that we can be told
completely ridiculous obviously ly
untrue things and still act like they're
true it's been tested now I don't mean
tested intentionally for the purpose of
doing this I just mean that we have
experience where the media has so erased
reality think of the laptop remember the
51 experts who said that laptop is
Russian disinformation they can make
anything go away and they can make
anything appear like Russia
collusion so they have complete control
over
reality and if you think that reality is
going to save
you it
might but I wouldn't bet on
it I think that the controllers of
reality will just change reality to what
they need it to be
so that's where we're at I'm not 100%
sure that'll happen but
it's totally possible that they'll just
tell you the other person won
well CNN also had so this is kind of a
trend now you're starting to see a
little pattern uh they had Paul Dans
who's one of I guess he was the head of
the project 2025 thing but he may have
left by now I think and he said as
clearly as possible that Trump had
nothing to do with it their project 2025
started before he was even running for
office and it's just not a trump thing
it's a it's a them thing now CNN had
that on now keep in mind that the you
know the biggest campaign rallying Cry
of Harris is that oh that project 2025
is
trumps and CNN just debunked it right in
front of their
audience what's up with that so that
would be a strong indication the CNN's
trying to find the
middle so those are three indications
just in 24 hours where something got
reported accurately and usefully
it looks it it's jarring because CNN is
just so noted for fake news in my
opinion that seeing them just treat
three different things just the way
you'd expect it to be treated if you
were just talking about it
factually uh is kind of
jarring does it mean
something does it
suggest that maybe the powers of be
might still have another
Switcheroo could it
be that maybe there's some people who
think you know one more switch if the if
the debate doesn't work out maybe one
more
switch what would stop them do you tell
me anything that would stop them from
trading around remember she got zero
votes how hard would it be to trade out
somebody who got zero
votes I mean they got us this far what
would be a little bit more Shenanigans
now I think it would be too weird
embarrassing and it wouldn't even work
to switch around right now but if she
really dies in the uh
debate and they're certainly signaling a
lack of confidence in her to debate by
the fact that she's not in public
much they might think that her debate is
going to be so bad that there is no way
that she can win after the debate if
they conclude there's no way she can win
let's say if the polls just go like they
did after the Biden debate which is very
possible I wouldn't bet on it but it's
quite
possible there's nothing to stop them
from replacing
her and I would argue that Trump you
know commanded a lead over Biden because
Biden was literally brain dead and he
commands he might command a you know a
winning looking polling situation over
Harris because she's the worst
politician you've ever seen those are
the two most special cases in all of
politics two people who aren't even
close to being you know minimally
qualified for the job they're trying to
do if they put in somebody who actually
you said oh well I disagree with this
person's policies this Democrat but I
have to
admit they're pretty
rational I think they would win I think
there's a whole bunch of people who just
want a rational president and they're
looking at you know Biden Harrison Trump
and in their opinion they sayou know
none of them are exactly ordinary
regular
people so I I could see if they
replaced um mean you just pick pick some
democrat you don't hate Coons you
remember what what's his first name
Senator
Coons whenever I see him
talk I say to myself oh he's you know
spinning and he's supporting his team
but he never looks crazy and he never
looks stupid and he never looks
uninformed if they just like plug that
guy in there at the last minute I'd
worry if they put it like just a person
who disagrees with me but he's smart I
would worry about that I'd worry about
that a lot but he might not be black
mailable enough to be
president here's what RFK Jr said on a a
podcast recently he said uh that the
Democratic party is so fundamentally
anti-democratic it now mirrors Putin's
regime in Russia now is that something
he can back up well he gave four
examples uh they got rid of the
primaries to make sure that Kennedy
couldn't be part of it um they hid Joe
Biden's cognitive def
deficits uh when there was a palace coup
essentially against Biden uh he was
replaced without any kind of election so
he basically picked his own successor
Russia style uh the media only gave
Kenedy two interviews in 17
months uh whereas Ross perau had 34
interviews in
1992 and the Democrats conducted lawfare
to get both of their opponents off the
ballot RFK Jr and Trump all
true just four true statements that
support his theory that our government
or at least the Democrats have a regime
that looks very much like a totalitarian
dictator
situation it's a strong argument I mean
it's an analogy so it's not perfect of
course but argumental persuasive wise
persuasion wise yeah this one
hits according to slay news which I've
never heard of but I like their
name um Harris is backing uh this plan
to uh change the court I guess Senator
Sheldon White House Democrat he's
proposing significant changes to the
court and it could include for
example
um it would uh emphasize more recently
appointed justices basically so they
would appoint additional justices and
squeeze out the old
conservatives so so Harris is actually
in favor of that which would be the end
of the
Republic because if the presidency can
in you know in near time you know change
the composition of the
Court then there's not really much point
of having a court because the president
would determine which way things go with
a 98%
accuracy anyway so that's pretty
terrible Trump should tear her up on
that
um Matt Ridley who has written a lot
about Co and Co
Origins um he was uh posting and and
talking about this recently so here's
the evidence that covid began in the uh
Wuhan lab and that was
man-made so here are four facts number
one uh the co began next to the biggest
SARS lab on Earth you know they said it
happened next to it but big coincidence
right next to the lab that would work on
that kind of thing number two in 2015 so
this was before any of the lab leak that
lab was named the riskiest lab on the
planet okay so it was already known to
be the riskiest and it was exactly in
the one place on the whole planet that
the virus
happened okay but that's not proof I
mean coincidence is can happen right
does he have any more oh yeah in 2019 we
know that they planned to insert a fur
and
cleavage uh or or the or that the fur
and cleavage site would be this specific
one optimized for humans so it's at the
S1 S2
Junction which means something to
biologist butam me but there's a very
very specific kind of thing they were
looking at tweaking in this virus to
make it worse for humans
and Co it turns out is the only SARS
virus with that exact fur in sight
inserted at that
Junction so the very place that they
said they were going to put some
Mischief some Mischief is there and
there's not a single other virus in that
family that has any Mischief in that
area so it began at the near the
lab that was the riskiest in the planet
that was doing this kind of work and it
was ex and what happened was exactly
what they said they were going to do and
there's only one virus that's ever had
that happen to
it and as Matt Ridley explains in ways
that just will make your head
explode that even today he can't get uh
anybody who disagrees with him to appear
at any public forum to argue the
opposite that it didn't happen
there so the scientists are just so
scared of even approaching this topic
that they can't even deal with reality
on
it so this is not a story about viruses
or the pandemic this is a story about
how easily the truth and science can be
hidden even though there are a million
scientists because your common sense
says to you well wait if I've got a
million
scientists certainly a 100,000 of them
at least are going to be on the other
side of anything you know you could
randomly pick a topic and if you've got
a million scientists you're certainly
going to get a 100 thousand who disagree
with whatever the science is at the
moment nope nope you can completely shut
down science with you know money and
threats and reputational ruin and fake
news and all
that
so I figured out how to tell when uh
joose Scarboro is lying now you're going
to say oh it's when his mouth moves and
I know what you mean I get it I get it
it's when his mouth moves
um but uh I've been watching some old
videos where we knew he lied and then
you get to go back and watch now I do
this to look for how people lie so it's
it's kind of special when you can know
somebody lied in according to your
current information but then you look at
the video of them doing the actual lying
and you watch how their face changes and
their manner changes here here's uh Joe
Scarboro telling you something that he
actually believes I'll do my impression
and uh Donald Trump uh he's a big old
liar he doesn't pass the factchecking
and a lot of people will be uh you know
very upset if he's
elected okay that's probably his real
opinion I'm not saying it's true or not
true but probably a real
opinion now let me give you Joe Scarboro
when he knows he's
lying let me tell you everyone and you
can just shut the f up if you disagree I
don't even care what you think I'm going
to tell you the
truth Joe Biden is the smartest man on
the
planet see when when he gets all like up
in your face and he's so mad at you that
you're you're an
idiot so I want to show you all
this you probably saw in the news uh I
think it's John Campbell he's one of the
co uh guys who talks about it a lot uh
he had some images of what he said were
these micro structures that allegedly
the vaccination was creating in your
bloodstream so here's one of the
pictures
of allegedly the
micro thing
now I'm pretty sure that that's a
diagram of an
airport with a penis connected in the
middle I do not believe that is a
picture of a thing that's a structure
forming in my
bloodstream I do not now if you'd like
to ask if you if you're
wondering is John Campbell a credible
source for
science um I'm going to say because I
don't like getting sued you should
Google
him and whenever I'm looking to see if
somebody's you know ever been debunked I
always just put in debunk you know just
put in the name of a person then debunk
and just read what other people
say now I've been following you for a
while and uh my own
opinion is that
uh there's no pandemic information
that's accurate it's all so
every study I see I just don't believe
do you remember the remember when the
people who got the vacination their
blood was all coagulated and when they
did the autopsies it was like my God
we've never even seen blood like this
it's like the BL blood turned solid or
something and and so many of you
believed that that was true
and I looked at that story and I said I
don't know anything about viruses or uh
I don't know anything about this
field but I'm pretty sure that's not
true because it was just too
obviously kind of insanely
ridiculous that that would be happening
and it wouldn't be the biggest story in
the
world but we've also seen that they can
hide the stories about the Wuhan lab
being the source of the leak so there's
almost nothing the news can't hide from
you but I'm pretty sure if that was
happening we would know by now
now am I right about all of my opinions
on the science of stuff probably not not
all of it but I would say that claims
like that no matter who makes them 95%
of them are going to BBS 95% but that
still leaves 5% which could you know
tell the whole story so the
5% potentially could tell you that the
vaccinations were a bad idea but I don't
know what 5% is true so if you're
looking at any particular group of
claims just know that 95% of them are
not true maybe 5% are true but you'll
never know which ones because all that
all the data is motivated and we can see
from every field of science that people
can't handle data so I wouldn't believe
anything about
anything that's my general thing
um
so in this next news story uh you've
heard me say this phrase the cat is on
the
roof you know it's part of a
joke well the cat is on the
roof wait I'm getting an update
about the cat
oh all right never
mind didn't go well for the cat it was
in Ohio no it's just recreational fund
there's no such thing probably of
anybody eating any
cats
maybe I'm pretty sure the story is not
reliable but it's fun
Recreation well Melania Melania
Trump uh has some kind of a story to
tell that she's very unhappy as
sounds about the investigation into the
potential almost assassination of her
husband now Melania always fascinates me
because I think we all have this
question which is what is it like to be
married to
Trump you don't you wonder that like
what is that like like what is the
nature of their understanding with each
other how does she how does she put up
with it them you know just how do they
negotiate that and I'm impressed as hell
that they're still together I mean I'm
impressed When anybody stays together
but when you see
her um on the video when she's she's
basically showing some emotion about
this she's not a happy camper that
somebody tried to shoot her husband and
I I'll tell you in it I see a depth of
feeling for him that was kind of
interesting to say now I don't want to
you know I don't read any Minds I can't
characterize her relationship or what
she's thinking but I do not see her
doing the video that I saw where she's
very much
questioning the official um story about
the assassination attempt she looked
like she was fully
in like that didn't look like somebody
who had one foot out the door or
something like that she looked
like yeah she was in like it was her now
keep in mind she's also talking about
the father of her
son so I mean no matter what their
personal relationship is she would fight
for the father of her son in this
situation you know just like it was you
know life or death I would imagine so
anyway Melania continues to be uh a
positive force in the
world um there's a video I don't know
how old it was didn't have a date on it
of KL Harris in an interview uh saying
that she Embraces astrology and she's a
Libra and her husband is a Libra and
Libra is the sign that's famous for not
being able to make a decision because
they're balancing everything well on
this side oh but on the other hand and
she tells a story about when she sits
down with her husband Doug and they they
say oh let's watch a Netflix movie and
then they spend the entire time looking
for one and not being able to decide and
then they run out of time and just go to
bed now on one hand it's a great
story if you were not running for
president because it does it has more to
do with having lots of choices and our
complicated world and I've had the same
experience you've had the same
experience right so as an anecdote it's
a real fun
story as running for president it's the
last thing I want to hear is that she's
looking at AST astrology with a little
bit too much interest and that she can't
make decisions and that she's totally
aware that she can't make
decisions now is there anything you've
seen about her campaign so far that
would suggest she's bad at making
decisions
yes because it took her quite a while to
even have her policies up if you were a
decisive person you'd have your policies
up in I don't know 72
hours it's because she can't decide
that's and now the policies on her
website are kind of vague do you know
why because she can't decide and there's
questions about what she thought in 2019
versus now do you know why because she
can't decide she told us in her own
words that she's poor at making
decisions I I don't think she was joking
about that she even gave a reason that
she's a
Libra if somebody tells you they're bad
at making decisions while they're
running for president she probably said
it before she was running for
president because I couldn't tell the
date but that is pretty bad that's
pretty
bad uh Scott Jennings is having fun
mocking uh the supporters of uh of
Harris because they were happy that dick
Cheney endorsed
her and Scott Jennings said Democrats
have called Dick Cheney a war criminal
for 20 years and now all of a sudden
they're clapping like seals to get his
endorsement it's like has nobody noticed
that these are not the normal
Republicans the ones that are endorsing
Harris they are the ones that are most
associated with military industrial
complex I don't think Trump Trump wanted
Dick Cheney to be on his
side imagine if Dick Cheney had very
noticeably and publicly endorsed Trump
what would the Democrats say about that
they'd say well here here it is there it
is that's all you need to know yeah if
Dick Cheney is endorsing him that's all
you need to know we've been telling you
he's a war criminal for 20 years so so I
guess that means that Trump's a war
criminal by
association ifo facto QED
so that's fun all right I've got an
economics question for you JD Vance says
that if KLA Harris's plan to give uh
firsttime home buyers including those
who are not legal residents um gives
them $25,000 to help him buy house JD
Vance says the price of the house will
just go up
$25,000 go supply and demand how many
agree with that simple
statement that if you give people more
money for houses the price of the houses
will go up roughly by the same amount of
that because now that's what the that's
what the uh the market can bear make
sense all right I'm not on board with
that here's why now I don't know the
answer but I'll tell you how to think
about it so this is more about how to
think about it here here's a
mental um experiment for you let's say
this $25,000 for firsttime home buyers
was given to one and only one person in
the
world and they're in a certain zip code
and now they've got $25,000 extra what
happens to the price of homes in that
zip
code
nothing nothing right I mean one home
might be bid up a little bit so the
comps in that neighborhood go up a
little bit but basically nothing because
it's just one person they're not going
to change the market now suppose every
every single person who was going to buy
a home for the first time every one of
them got the $25,000 and used it what
happens in that case well in that case I
think JD Vance is close to Target
meaning that if everybody had $225,000
extra yeah the people selling it would
sniff that out or at least the bidding
would you know the bidding for the homes
if there's bidding there usually is
lately would basically work that into
the market right right away so here's
the question you forgot to ask what
percentage of home buyers for those
homes that would be called the starter
homes are actually buying them for the
first time do you know is it 95% or buy
them for the first time or is it
10% because that's that's the answer to
the question if it's
10% it's probably not making that much
difference to the cost of homes but a
little you know demand increases is
right with more demand the prices go up
but you need to know what that
percentage is now the answer is it could
be in the 30%
range so if 30% of the people have more
money it kind of depends on the you know
how much how many homes are available
and how many people are looking for them
at the same time and all that so uh that
doesn't make it a good
idea I'm just saying that the reality is
that if you gave new home buyers an
extra
25,000 some of them are just going to
use it to buy
furniture they're going to say oh I
could already afford the home but if I'm
going to get a free
$25,000 I'll use it to improve my
furniture would make no difference to
the home
prices some people and I would put
myself in this category if I were within
$225,000 of buying a home I wouldn't buy
a home that's that's not enough
margin but if I thought I could afford
it already but I was sort of on the
fence I'd take the 25,000 extra and I
just put it in the
bank I wouldn't use it to buy a more
expensive home I buy the same home I
could afford before it but I have a
little more cushion so nobody would even
know I had the money it wouldn't it
wouldn't be in the Market at
all so if you don't know the answer to
all those questions you don't know how
much the 25,000 would increase the price
of
homes but it'll have some effect it's
not going to go down it'll have some
effect but probably more positive than
negative especially since it's good for
the economy in general and even even if
you imagined it was a money loser in the
short run the more people you put in
homes the more they're buying furniture
and H related goods and spurring the
economy and being more invested in the
country because they've got a stake in
so my guess is that that that plan is
probably more good than bad but you
can't tell and you could easily argue
that with our deficit what it is it's
not really where you want to put the
money it's just not as clear as you
think it is one way or the other that's
that's all it's just not
clear uh apparently RFK JR says that
Trump admitted to him privately that
Trump didn't drain the swamp his first
term and he wants RFK Jr to help him
drain it and he said uh this is what RFK
JR says to that conversation quote he
said I didn't know anything about
governing and and Trump said we won this
election and then all of a sudden uh he
had to fill 60,000 jobs he said I was
surrounded by people lobbyists and
business interests who were saying you
got to appoint this guy and that's what
I did so that's how the the swamp just
recreated itself because he didn't have
the
wherewithal to fill all those job so he
took recommendations and they were not
good and he says they brought in a a
telecom lobbyist to run the FCC they
brought in an oil lobbyist to run the
department of interior a coal lobbyist
to run the EPA another Pharma lobbyist
to run HHS this is from Trump himself so
if you're wondering to yourself does
Trump know he didn't drain the swamp and
he promised to drain the swamp the
answer is yes he does and he can tell
you exactly why he didn't do it and
takes apparently he's taking
responsibility for it at least to RFK Jr
and he's saying I I did it wrong but now
I know how to do it right with your help
the with your help part is the key
because Trump didn't have that kind of
help before so yes the argument that he
would drain the swamp or get a lot
closer to it went from I don't know
Kenny you know I I sort of always doubt
that that was going to be much of a
thing but now I
don't now I don't if if your advisers
are ill on musk and uh you know uh V
ramas Swami and RFK Jr and
uh you know I could go
on those are people who are not going to
give you the
swamp so he is now built a machine a
pirate ship I like to call it and that
pirate ship definitely can beat the
swamp or at least it's a fair fight
right but before he had no pirate ship
there was just the swamp versus him and
he got
overwhelmed uh Jason from the all-in Pod
you know they had their all-in pod event
I mentioned and he asked Elon Musk quote
um if you could shrink the size of
government with Trump what would be a
good Target for how much to shrink it
here was elon's answer quote are you
trying to get me assassinated before
this even
happens now it was a laugh line but yes
that was the correct answer you do not
want to tell them because then they'll
panic and then they'll resist but you
know like uh like you did with X if one
day you come in and there's a little
pink slip on your
chair well not as much complaining even
if you're more unhappy because your
opper opportunity for resisting goes
down apparently there's a member of UK
Parliament um who's got concerns over
how X is
handling information and National
Security threats and uh thinks that U
Elon Musk could face a possible
summons uh before the UK
Parliament so in other words he might be
summoned to talk to the UK
Parliament um Mike Ben
says uh in a situation where there's a
another country who is targeted an
American interest which is vital to
America which I think it is vital Free
Speech the American ambassador to to the
UK should be all over this they should
be calling this uh this politician in
and saying ah you and I need to have a
conversation because it looks like
you're targeting an American company
and you know we have lots of interests
in common and if you target an American
company I can pretty much guarantee this
is going to come back to you that's the
conversation that has to happen if we're
just sitting here watching another
country Abus an American citizen at this
level then we don't have a government
the government should be protecting him
aggressively and nothing not even a not
even a statement so that's your
government right now maybe we could get
better ambassadors under a different
Administration well remember I told you
that CNN seems to be finding the middle
on this presidential stuff but ABC News
how they doing well they're going to be
hosting the debate so I hope they're
finding the middle right well there was
a recent study that said their coverage
has been 100% positive for Harris but
for Trump it's been 93% negative oh okay
other than in MSNBC it's the very worst
place in the world for Trump to have a
debate but I do love the fact that Trump
says yes to the very worst situation for
Trump and also believes that he can go
in and dominate even if it's totally set
up against them and I think he's right
because he has you know a long history
of being able to walk into any situation
and just own the room and Hollow it out
and wear it as a suit
so I think ABC News is going to have
quite a show on their
hands um America First
legal that's uh the Republican oriented
uh entity that's challenging various
Democrat bad behavior with their with
their own legal
resources uh have now asked or the US
government uh based on a foyer request
to
reveal any information where the US and
Brazil
colluded on any of this judge Alexandre
de Mor's uh edicts about shutting down X
in Brazil so the question is is Brazil
being used by the United States CIA or
state department as a tool of
internal control meaning they want to
control X and they want to control musk
and they can't do it with any American
laws but if the Brazilians are worth
doing it you know are we are we
communicating with them and saying hey
hey Brazil you know we we don't love
your new leader but um you know if you
could just take care of this one thing
for us if you could really kind of lean
on X we might be flexible in a few other
areas with you so we don't know if that
conversation happened that's what
America First legal is trying to find
out and I will say again that before
America first legal existed I felt like
the Republicans were in a stick fight
and they didn't have a stick because the
Republicans were getting just lawfare to
death and nothing was coming back and
now America first and so far their their
choice of targets has been really good
meaning that they're asking exactly the
questions you want asked and they're
going hard and it looks like they're
sparing no expense to to to mix it up
here
so I think this is one of the best
things that's happened to the country is
having an America First legal you know W
in and being a an important Force I mean
they're they're already up to speed as
an important
Force so more of that
please well Mike
Davis who uh I don't know how to explain
him he's not an elected official but uh
he's
a what would be the best way to say he's
active in the Republican side of
politics and I think he's got
uh um I think he's got some legal
background so I don't know too much
about him we follow each other in X um
but he's been saying that uh when uh
Trump
wins that he expects to be prosecution
of a number of Democrats uh and he
included apparently in that list the the
Soros prosecutors who don't look legit
to people like
me
um and this is scaring people on uh the
right and Mike Davis says no one is
above the law oh God I love this the
only thing he's threatening is that
people who broke the law will have to
answer for
it he's not saying that we're going to
put people in jail for not breaking the
law he's saying that the bad behavior
that we all witness I mean all these
these prosecutors to me they look like
criminals if they don't look like
criminals to you you must have been
watching something else they have jobs
where they're supposed to be putting
criminals away but we all got to watch
and to me they look like
criminals so if they if they've got
something they can be indicted on and
charged with then I say no one's above
the law
now to me their their fear of this
meaning the Democrat fear of this does
suggest that they know they're using the
law inappropriately to laware
Trump because otherwise I think they
would say Well yeah if they broke the
law
sure I think their Panic about it feels
like a confession they know they've been
using the law inappropriately to attack
Democrats and when they see the the
Republicans and Mike Davis taking a lead
in this when they see them saying you
know what every bit of this is coming
back to
you they're
panicked now I don't think Trump would
do that I don't think he would want to
be back at least not himself maybe
somebody else would do it but I don't
think Trump feels like law faring his uh
adversaries even after they lawed him is
necessarily the best thing for the
country so I do think Trump is going to
look at the big picture here he might
need to break break the
cycle um if the cycle keeps him out of
office then probably all bets are off I
feel like the Democrats probably are in
more trouble if Trump doesn't win if he
does win he might make some political
calculations and say okay definitely if
we went after these Soros prosecutors
we'd find something
but we can't be the ones who go looking
for a
crime right if there's a crime alleged
already then yes do what you got to do
but it turns into lawfare if you go
looking for a crime you know show me the
person will find you the crime I don't
think Trump would support
that that's what I
think I I hope I'm right about that and
and I get the whole you know mutually
assur destruction you you need to hit
back the way they hit you you otherwise
they'll just keep doing it I get all
that but there might be a higher
principle here that you just can't
laware the other side indefinitely you
just can't do
it um anyway on the other hand it would
keep those Soros prosecutors in office
and that would be a tragedy
too
um so according to the Federalist
there's a California law that now
mandates that students have to learn
climate change the way the
the way the majority of scientists want
them to learn it now since I think
climate change is mostly BS although I
don't know what is true about the
climate changing and the human uh
contribution to it I do know that the
climate models are
ridiculous that's a longer conversation
we've had before and I do know that
science can't be
trusted and if you're not teaching the
kids that
then they're just being
brainwashed if they were teaching them
here's everything that the scientists
say is true about the um climate here
are the reasons you don't need to worry
about it number one the models are
ineffective number two warmer might be
better than colder uh number three we're
going to invent all these things we'll
probably have more energy for air
conditioning and everything
else if you did it that way I'd be
totally okay with that just say the
scientists say this is true but the
models are not exactly science and
here's what you need to know about how
models can fool you if you give me that
lesson I'll say that's pretty
good but if you're just going to teach
the mainstream scientists can't be right
because they all agree that is
and that would be
brainwashing all
right according to also slay
news um there's a loophole in the voting
in
Wisconsin where you don't need ID if you
are in the category of people who are
let's see the category
is indefinitely
confined if you if you simply state that
you are inde indefinitely confined I
assume that means to jail maybe it needs
means medically also
um then uh people just need to say
they're indefinitely confined and then
they can vote without an ID which means
a giant loophole for voting illegally
now how many reports have you heard in
the past year about loopholes in
particular States or holes or you know
potentially computer problems and I feel
like I've
seen
50 50 claims of election problems that
look pretty real you maybe they weren't
the the one thing that changes
everything but they were
real and we still sell the sell the
message that the
elections can be trusted probably 50
different problems we found I mean I'm
just going off the top of my head from
what it feels like in the past year now
if you're on the right or well if you're
on the left I'll bet you saw none of
them if you just followed the New York
Times and CNN I'll bet you didn't hear
of even one confirmed problem of
anything with an
election but if you're on the right and
you're on X it's every
day every day there's another story of
somebody who got away with something or
got caught but they tried
something every single day and yet the
public is is told oh these systems are
fine well
zalinski uh is in Italy and he thinks
that a peace plan will be ready in
November well I can confirm that there
will be a peace plan uh this is breaking
news so I'm going to break this story
for you in November there will in fact
be a peace plan for
Ukraine no not because of zalinski no
not because of zinski
is because Trump will be
president
elected yeah that's my peace plan here's
my peace plan we're going to elect Trump
and then he's going to sort your
out that's my peace plan and I'm done
now you're going to say to me but but
but it's difficult yeah I know but but
but neither side will agree yes they
will but but but I don't care about your
but yes Trump can settle this right
away and the reason he can do it is is
both sides want him
to let me say that again Ukraine wants
Trump to solve this Putin wants Trump to
solve
this if one of them didn't want him to
solve it then it would be
impossible or nearly impossible but they
want it he's the fake
because they both want to say he scared
us too much so we agreed or some
something like that that they want to be
able to say that there was something
bigger than them that came and well we
we would have fought forever for Ukraine
but you know Trump that big meanie he
came in and he threatened us and well we
just had to settle and Putin's going to
do some version of that you know maybe a
braver version just say well you know we
didn't want to fight forever Trump
offered us the solution seemed like the
right time to take it Trump is the fake
because everybody's already decided
the decisions are basically made he just
has to come in there and exist oh
Trump's here all right let's do the
thing we all wanted to do and we'll say
that he's the one who made us do
it all right I saw in the comments that
before I dismiss the stories of Haitians
eating animals I should look into the uh
Voodoo practices of
Haitians let me say it again because
maybe you didn't hear me clearly the
first time I am not denying that some
Haitian in the United States ate an
animal maybe more than
one I am only saying that it doesn't
seem to be a major
Trend that you know is compatible with
the top hundred things I'm worrying
about if it were my cat well then it
would be life or
death then I'd be down for anything but
but you know it's a big world with lots
of tragedies and uh I'm going to I'm
going to not worry about that one so
much until we hear more if we hear more
then maybe I'll worry about it more um
now I've also seen many of you uh
racists saying that the IQ of the
Haitians is unusually
low so I thought I would Google it
before I got on here to debunk it
because some people were saying that the
average IQ of the Haitians was like
78 and I thought I can't be
true I can't believe they average the
average is 78 so I Googled it to debunk
because I was talking to the locals
people before the the main broadcast
here and uh I thought I want to clear
them up and maybe disab them of their
racist racist views
so I looked it up and sure enough I was
surprised to find that at one point uh
there was a study that said that the IQ
of the average Asian was
78 and then I said to myself oh shoot I
guess I'm pretty wrong but then things
turned around and it turns out I was
right I was right in the end they do not
have an average IQ of 78 there were some
new studies that uh more updated and uh
they came up with the average the actual
average IQ was
60 so I was right in the sense that it
wasn't
78 do you believe their average IQ is
60 I don't believe that I don't believe
that at all there probably something
about how they test something like that
I don't believe that there are human
beings who can survive if their
population is
60 you know if that were true the entire
nation of Haiti would be just
a oh
H okay well I guess I can't debunk it by
looking at the uh excellent progress of
80 but I don't believe it's
60 I don't believe it's 60 I I I'll only
go there I don't know what it is but I
don't think it's 60 I just don't think
you could wake up and survive the day at
60 so I don't know what it
is but
uh I guess we'll find out how many
people we can we can integrate somebody
said we've got 5% of all Haiti has moved
to the United States in the last few
years so we'll see how that
goes um doesn't it depend on who Des
designed the IQ
test well I've got a feeling the IQ test
stop
working um maybe if you're not
literate if you're not
literate can they really do an IQ
test so I'm not even sure that you could
administer some kind of average IQ test
if you have low literacy so I don't know
the answer that but I don't believe it's
can't be 60 that can't be true Google
says it but it can't be
true all right ladies and
gentlemen
um that concludes my show for the day we
will be joining you tonight for the
debate I'm going to say a few words to
the locals people before I go but for
the rest of you thanks for joining on X
