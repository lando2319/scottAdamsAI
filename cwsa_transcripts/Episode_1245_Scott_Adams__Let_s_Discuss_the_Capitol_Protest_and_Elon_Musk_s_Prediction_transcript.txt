good morning everybody
come on in come on in you'll be fine
everything's going to work out
now you might be wondering why the sound
quality is not so good if you're
watching this on the live stream on
youtube and it's because i haven't yet
ordered my
adapter so i can charge my ipad at the
same time i can have my
microphone plugged in so if you want the
better
sound quality you go over to periscope
live stream
why are you here this morning i think i
know
i think i know and it starts with a
simultaneous sip and all you need is a
cough
copper mega i got up a little early this
morning
speaking might be a problem
but all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass a tank or chelsea steiner canteen
jugger flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and somebody says are you missing a
microphone
the plug in the audio all right so those
of you just coming in
i just told you that the audio on
youtube will be low
because i'm not using a microphone i
have it plugged in for charging
go to go to my twitter feed and
go to well if you go to my twitter feed
you'll see the live stream with
microphone
on the other platform so
um i will be ignoring the rest of you
all right you i'm just gonna turn
off youtube
all right youtube is cancelled
because they couldn't handle the
they couldn't handle the sound
so just you today uh periscope
uh turns out the youtube people
complained too much so i had to
i just turned them off
let us begin again with less complaints
here's the most interesting thing that
happened today and it wasn't the capital
protest we'll get those in a minute
elon musk tweeted that the most
entertaining outcome is the most likely
the most entertaining outcome
is the most likely what do you think
well it may be something you've heard me
say before and is a coincidence
that two people who are known to believe
that we are in a software simulation
and not a classic reality
believe that the outcomes tend to be
biased
toward whatever is the most entertaining
why would that be
can uh can uh
can there be any logical reason why if
we're a simulation or even if we're not
the outcomes would be biased toward what
is most entertaining
and the answer is yeah yeah
oh i know what happened i got uh i got
sidetracked in the middle of the
simultaneous sip
and i realized that i've primed you so
much that if you don't get it
something's gonna be wrong with your day
back up
back up for those of you who are not
addicted to the simultaneous sip
please bear with us we'll only take a
second
you ready let's go from the top a couple
of muggle glasses all you need attacker
tells you challenger steiner can't enjoy
your classic vessel of any kind fill it
with your
favorite liquid i like coffee join me
now for the
dopamine of the day the thing makes
everything better go
ah now there you go
wasn't that what you wanted i think so
i think so all right there is a reason
that reality tends to trend toward
whatever is most
entertaining and it is this i believe
that
artificial intelligence is making a lot
more decisions
for us than we know and if there's one
thing that artificial intelligence wants
at least if that artificial intelligence
is being used
as part of a social media platform
that artificial intelligence wants the
most interesting outcome
that's what gets the most clicks so when
elon says
the most entertaining outcome is the
most likely i agree
because we do have a system that is
biased in that direction
the department of energy released the
statement
and says they're going big on energy for
space
strategy a big part of that is nuclear
energy
which means that well i won't say it
means that
but the only way you can have a good
nuclear power
program for space is if you've got a
robust
private industry of nuclear energy right
now
it's kind of shrinking or staying the
same but unless we grow our private
nuclear energy
industry we won't have the experts we
need to take that expertise
into space so this is a really really
big deal for the country and the world
and the fate of humanity
but it just sounds like a boring little
press release oh yeah we're gonna
work really hard for energy sources for
space
it's a big deal all right those are the
good news let's talk about
the protests uh here's the bad news
first
according to the dc police there were
four deaths
one shooting and then three had some
kind of medical problems
that are unclear might have been
coincidence i don't know about four
people dead that's horrible
52 arrested that's horrible
and 14 metropolitan police department's
officer is wounded now isn't wounded
and interesting choice of words isn't
injured maybe more
objective wounded sounds like
people were trying to hurt them were
they all hurt
because people were trying to hurt them
because that wound it would make sense
i don't know i would say that injured
would be you know injured in the course
of the job would be at least more
objective
now are do we
do we have only adults watching this
today
because if there are any children
watching
there's something that i need to explain
to the children
you can be in favor of things even if
there's a big cost
to them that's the children don't
understand that i know the adults
understand it
that you could still be in favor of
let's say a defensive war
knowing that people will die so you're
not in favor of death
in favor of self-defense that would be
one example
likewise with these protests at the
capitol
i would like to unambiguously say that i
support them
while still unambiguously saying i don't
support any violence
of any kind now and certainly the
the types of numbers that we saw under
this protest
are disturbing the the death is extra
tragic
the deaths and um i don't minimize that
so for the benefit of the children
watching
i'm not minimizing the death and
destruction
they're real and you don't want more of
that
but at the same time the the energy of
this protest the
purpose of the protest the intention of
it the
i think the well-meaning purpose of it
i support 100
now when i say i support the protesters
i am
saying that i personally have you know
proof of election fraud and
you know i've seen it nothing like that
i'm just saying that we had a
non-transparent
non-credible election for a variety of
reasons some of them
nobody's fault you know the the
coronavirus situation
made it hard to do it right so we did it
didn't do it right in terms of
credibility i don't know about the vote
count
but the credibility of it was low
so is there anything more important than
that
to protest i can't think of anything
i i think black lives matter had an
important
issue which is a concern that
you know the police were treating people
differently now you could argue about
the facts of that
but that's a pretty good issue so if
you're asking me should black lives
matter
you know is it moral or ethical for them
to
protest that issue i'd say yeah that's
totally ethical
totally moral probably get a better
world out of it if you can keep the
violence and the destruction down
now black lives matter especially
because anti-fog
got in on it didn't really keep
violence and destruction down to a
minimum
so that's suboptimal nobody can be happy
about that
but i think their issue was absolutely
worth airing out
even if some of the facts behind it
maybe were not exactly what they thought
they were but the issue is still worth
it
to find out what are the facts do we
have a problem
how big is the problem what can you do
about it absolutely worthwhile
but then the violence is not you know
that's the violence the destruction
are condemned so i will condemn them
exactly the way i condemned black lives
matter
exactly the same so i'll be maybe the
one person who's
uh consistent today you're not going to
see a lot of consistency
in the next few days but i'll try to be
i'm going to say that uh same standard
for these protesters
uh if if anything they did led to
destruction
and or injury especially injury of
police
then that then i disavow them and
condemn them in the same language
okay that said
here are some things we don't know about
this protest yet and i'd like to
number one how much damage was there
because i feel as if one of the stories
is the low amount of damage
now have you seen the video yet of
a protester who was at least in the
crowd
with the the trump supporting people
and he had some kind of a club and he
was trying to break a window
and the mega people were trying to stop
him
and eventually one of them physically
you know
tackled him now the
allegation is that the person's trying
to break the window that one that i saw
on video and apparently there are a
number of other videos of
similarly sketchy behavior that looks
exactly like
it was pretending to be trump supporters
in fact
the guy beating on the window had an
anti-fog black block
outfit on with a bumper sticker that
said trump on the back of his helmet
didn't look exactly like a trump
supporter if you know what i mean
looked exactly like antifa being stopped
by trump supporters that's what it
looked like
so i would say the jury is out about
who exactly was doing what still the fog
of war
if you're saying that antifa is
confirmed
to have been there i would say not yet
if i had to put money on it they looked
antifa to me
but i'm not in the 80 percent likelihood
i'm 60 percent maybe
so i don't think i would uh bet my life
that antifa was actually
infiltrating the group there could have
easily been you know trump supporters
who went a little too far and the other
one stopped them we don't know
but it's definitely a good question
so don't let me minimize the uh
potential or the risk that that had been
infiltrated
let me ask you this if you were a
uh an enemy of this country wouldn't it
be the perfect thing to do
infiltrate that group and cause more
trouble than the group itself was
likely to cause it'd be a good strategy
so if nobody tried to do it
if nobody tried to put some
troublemakers in there
to make things worse well then our
enemies are not as capable as we thought
so there's a good chance that there were
some troublemakers in the crowd that
were not
technically mega people but we don't
know
now the big story of course and the most
concerning one is that one of the
protesters a woman who's
actually a veteran which i think is
important to the story
uh was shot in the neck at fairly close
range
as she was trying to breach through a i
guess a
broken large window and a door she was
trying to
climb through it and somebody we don't
know who
in the security side of things for the
building could be secret service
maybe somebody else you you could see a
gun come out
point directly at her take one shot
and killed her now
i asked dan bongino this morning and by
the way how amazing is it
that i can just have a question and just
type it out on my keyboard here in
california
and somebody who actually knows the
answers to this sort of thing
gives me a direct answer so dan bongino
answered almost right away
and he said this he said well the
question i asked was this
is there ever a strategy
an intentional strategy that involves
shooting a woman in a crowd as a
strategy to suppress the crowd
now i just asked that question
it's not an accusation it's just i don't
know
and the reason i asked the question is i
was thinking
what would i do let's say a crowd of
people
gathered around my home and i knew that
they all wanted to
to cause me harm some were women some
were men but they were all there to
cause me harm
so they were all kind of equally guilty
in this
artificial scenario and i've thought to
myself what would i do
if i had one gun but it was a big crowd
and maybe they weren't so armed but i
wanted to
stop them from getting in the house
i probably shouldn't say this in public
but i'd probably take out a woman
because here's my theory and this is
what i was checking with people who
actually know this world
this is a world i don't know so i'm just
sort of speculating and guessing
you know how things might go if you took
out a man
i believe the crowd would say get him
because it's war now when a man gets
killed in a conflict that's just war
so war is on the crowd goes nuts flames
passions are inflamed they surround me
they kill me
but and this is just the hypothesis
just a hypothesis that if you take out a
woman
the crowd instead of saying it's war
let's attack
the crowd immediately reevaluates
their lives you see the difference
kill a man in some kind of a dangerous
situation and people go ah
men get killed because if we're being
honest society doesn't really care that
much about men
let's be honest that's that's why men do
the dangerous work
and nobody nobody looks to change that
situation
men are a little bit expendable so if
you shoot a man
as your strategy for stopping the crowd
you have to accept that the crowd
doesn't give a about men
now the people who know him personally
would you know it wouldn't be nothing
but compared to shooting a woman it's
not the same
i think shooting a woman takes all the
energy out of the crowd
because then they say to themselves my
god am i
involved in something that's killing
women it's different
let me tell you male brain strategy
if i'm involved in something let's say
i've got a good point to it
you know i think i'm in the right but
i'm involved in something that might get
a man killed do i care
nope nope not if
the thing i'm fighting for is more
important than some lives
and that that could easily be the the
case but
if you told me i'm involved in something
and it's very important
but i'm going to get it a woman killed
i might stop immediately now not for any
logical reason
it's just purely psychological
if women are getting killed i just
reassess my whole life
if men are getting killed it's just a
tuesday
true right so i simply ask the question
whether it could ever be an intentional
strategy
because i don't know how many women were
there now obviously she was
breaching the door so that's all the
reason you need
if if shooting had been allowed but i
asked dan bongino and he said this he
said their use of force guidelines are
clear
and unless there's a threat of spi which
i don't know what that is but it must be
a threat of
you know physical danger or death
they can't use deadly force
so here is my second follow-up question
i totally agree with dan bangido that
there there would be nothing
in writing in terms of use of force
guidelines
there's definitely nothing in writing
that says shoot the woman in the crowd
so here dan and i completely agree i
don't think there's any chance
that that's written down somewhere right
but here's my follow-up question
regardless of what their guidelines say
is it a known as in not just scott
speculating
but is it an understood and known
strategy
to shoot one protester if you think
you're at risk of a breach that could
get
elected politicians captured
so so let's boil down the question to
the simplest
specific could forget about the police
now i'm going to make a change from
police officers
and what what use of force they have
because i think that police officers
would have a different standard
than secret service protecting the
president let me give you an example
if uh and i don't know this is real by
the way this is just
speculation pure speculation do not take
anything away from this next part as
being true or fact or
or credible right just speculation that
a police officer would never be allowed
to shoot a civilian to save somebody
else
would you say that's true no police
officer could shoot in
a civilian who was not causing you know
imminent problems
uh no matter the reason there just
wouldn't ever be a reason to shoot an
innocent person
but suppose you're the secret service
and you're protecting maybe a vice
president
who might be somewhere behind these
doors
if you're protecting a vice president
and you're not a cop
your secret service and there is
an opportunity to protect your vice
president
but to do it you might have to shoot an
innocent
person would you do it
i kind of hope yes now it would be a
strange situation
where you would ever have to do that but
if there's a choice between shooting one
innocent person innocent meaning they
haven't done something that's quite a
a shootable crime yet but might they
haven't done it yet
could you do that to protect the
government
meaning meaning the leaders who give
stability to the entire
situation and i feel as though
it would never be taught that you should
do it
i feel as though people with deep
military training
might see it as the best path i'm just
speculating
i would like to be wrong about that but
when i watched the video
what i saw was somebody who was not
making a mistake
because it was too intentional and they
were not quite
in the heat of the moment meaning there
was some distance between the person
they shot who is not threatening them at
the moment
you know not directly and it looked
really intentional as if it had been a
strategy
now if it had been a panic i would have
expected more bullets
shot in it when it got a little bit more
maybe dangerous than it was at that
point but
you know it's fog of war anything
anything could be true at this point
don't commit to any of your assumptions
yet okay
we're all making a lot of assumptions
about that but don't commit to any of
them you're going to find out a lot of
new stuff
why is it that given that ted cruz and
the other people were asking for a 10
day
basically 10 days to do a an
audit and it wouldn't even stop the
inauguration
in other words it wouldn't even slow
down the process that's already
happening so how unreasonable is it
to ask for 10 days of an audit when you
have 10 days
is that unreasonable because the way the
fake news is
is framing this is that ted cruz and the
other politicians the republicans who
are going to challenge the election
integrity
that they've inspired the riots and
inspired the violence and that they're
guilty of it
now here's what inspiring violence would
sound like
hey you people pick up your weapons and
go down there and
do something bad that's what inspiring
violence sounds like
but if instead of that you say something
like
can we use the 10 days that we have to
do an audit
so that the public feels more confidence
in our election process
if you do that that's more like being an
accountant
right that's that's so far
from encouraging violence and is
literally
intended by its design to reduce the
risk of violence because if trump
supporters
could see that the audit had been done
and they said oh okay i thought there
were more problems but i guess we would
have found them in the audit
would that make the world a worse place
is that a call to arms
let me read you a headline that i
just had sent to me from my old local
paper
which is the times union and of albany
the headline says chaos at the capitol
so far so good subtitle says pro-trump
mob storm site after president's call to
arms
call to arms
did anybody hear the president
do a call to arms because i heard him
say the opposite
i heard him say the opposite you know be
peaceful go home
but this is a actual newspaper
who put an actual subtitle i guess you
would call that to the headline
saying that the president had a call to
arms
oh my god
oh my god
the thought that we have a press that
works for the benefit of the public
is ridiculous it's just ridiculous
they're not on your team whatever is
happening here they're not on your side
that's for sure
all right um
so trump has now announced i guess he
couldn't do it on twitter right away
because he was still blocked from
twitter for claiming that the election
was rigged
i believe that's why they blocked him i
think he i i saw that he deleted his two
tweets so he should be back in a few
hours
but he committed publicly with a written
statement
to a orderly transfer of power
now is there anybody as of right now
who still thinks that there's a risk
that trump
will not um go along with an orderly
transfer of power
here's my take on that everyone who
thought that he was going to try to
send it out and and i don't know what
squat in the white house and pretend he
was still running the country
you don't know much about the world
because that was the worst
prediction anybody ever made if you
predicted that he was even
inclined to do that you've bought into
the full fake news narrative
that was never credible
on top of that if your reading of the
situation is that it was even possible
you don't know anything about the world
the only way that would have been
possible
is if trump had a secret army i think we
would have known about his secret army
you need a private army to do that you
can't you can't count on
voters who happen to be part of a
voluntary army
to back you in a freaking coup that's
not going to happen
you know the the fake news sold this
idea
that that was an actual literal factual
thing that could happen
that trump could just decide to stay
and and people would rally around him
and somehow that would happen
no there was never any chance not not
the slightest chance
that that could have happened even if
you imagined which i think would be
crazy but at least
at least not impossible it's crazy but
not impossible if you imagine that trump
even
wanted to try doing that
i i don't think you should make
predictions anymore
if you thought trump was actually not
going to go along with an
orderly transfer of power
you really shouldn't make predictions
anymore that was the worst prediction
anybody ever made
all right um so a bunch of people in the
administration are quitting
see stephanie grisham former white house
communications director
and press secretary and former chief of
staffer
melania and uh i guess one
uh the ex-chief of staff who was now
it doesn't matter so a bunch of
politicians are quitting
over what they they're horrified by
trump's behavior
um how much does that matter when you
only had two weeks left of the job
that let let me let me applaud these
brave patriots
who resigned two weeks before they were
going to resign
anyway because it wasn't their choice
and have already lined up new jobs
you're you're so brave thank you
patriots
for taking that big step of resigning
after you already had new jobs
and two weeks of basically
ugliness that you didn't want to
experience
i don't know if this is the big
patriotic move that is being
that is being portrayed as or is this
just some small
people taking an opportunity to look
good before they go to their new jobs
it feels like a little bit of
selfishness
more than heroism but you can
make your own judgments on that
so representative corey bush a democrat
uh tweets uh i believe the republican
members of congress who have incited
this domestic terror attack
through their attempts to overturn the
election must face consequences they
have broken their sacred oath of office
i will be introducing a resolution
calling for their expulsion
so does that seem like the right
response
look at the the illogical connections
so members of congress
who are attempting to overturn the
election is that what they're doing
or are they attempting to make sure that
whoever won
was the one who got the right amount of
votes you know given the electoral
college
i feel as if what's happening is they're
just trying to make sure that the right
person won
does that equal and is that the same as
overturning an election
no let me ask you this
find me one trump supporter
who if they could see the vote in a way
that they believed
and it showed that biden won fair and
square
show me one trump supporter who
wants trump to be president
anyway if they knew he lost
zero people none
want that they just want to know there
was a real vote
and the right person won now they would
prefer trump one
of course but not if he lost the
vote
do you even know what a republican is
sorry let me let me let me summarize
what a republican is
a republican is the one who wants the
person who got the
most votes according to the electoral
college
to be the president if you don't want
that you're not a republican
so stop blaming republicans for wanting
something that is literally the opposite
of their definition
that bothers me a twitter user named
simon seems like a nice guy he said he
woke up feeling very shameful as an
american
he said this is no longer the great
country i wanted
to be no justice no dignity we are
cheaters
shame on us so he's feeling bad about
the election
and the response and i read that and i
thought you know
simon i like simon i like
that simon who has that kind of
love of the country you know i guess so
good for simon but i don't quite agree
with this take
and here's my take what i think is that
we are exact
we are acting we collectively and i'm
going to include the protesters
in this i think we are acting exactly
like a great country
exactly like a great country and here's
what i mean by that
because we're a great country that just
discovered a bug in the system
the bug is that the election was not
credible in a way that half the country
can be
happy with it that's a bug now
what do you do when there's a bug in the
system
if you ignore it are you a great country
nope no you're not if you try to fix it
and you meet resistance and then you
give up
because you met some resistance the
swamp tried to slow you down
the fake news tried to cover for you the
politicians were lying
so you got some resistance to fixing
this bug
and then you just said okay well we got
resistance
so i guess we'll let it go does that
sound like a great country
to you is that the country you want to
live in oh it's hard
it's hard so we quit nope
that's not a great country a great
country says we got a problem
if we can't fix it the easy way we'll
fix it the other way
right now if you try the other way first
well that's not smart that's not a great
country
but if you try to do it the normal
approved way
and it doesn't work and it's still the
biggest bug in the system
because if you don't have credible
elections you don't have
anything
so could they walk away from this bug
and consider themselves patriots
could they let this bug persist into the
next election
and still call this a great country no
no you can't what you're seeing
is what a great country does now a great
country still has bugs
because things changed nobody saw the
coronavirus we had to
we had to improvise at the last minute
and that allowed some mischief
but we're still a great country
and the greatest proof of that is
exactly what you just saw
exactly what you watched yesterday is
the proof
that it's a great country because when
they saw a bug
they went after it tried to fix it when
they met resistance
they pushed through it at least into the
capital
now are we done let me say this
to any politician who might be listening
it is definitely not appropriate
to do physical intimidation and to take
over the capitol building
under any normal situation i can think
of
but this isn't normal
it's not normal the the way the public
is viewing this election
half of them anyway is not like any time
before
at least no time i can remember in my
memory maybe in ancient history
but this isn't like normal times
you need an extraordinary solution to an
extraordinary
situation and i think that
giving our government a tap on the
shoulder
and that's what i would call these
protests these protests were not to kill
anybody
not to capture anybody they're not
trying to take anybody
you know hostage nothing like that was
happening
this was a tap on the shoulder let me
put it to you this way
let me give you a little story imagine a
president doesn't matter what president
you could use biden for this example
imagine president biden he's sitting in
the oval office
and there's an issue and it comes to him
and it's on a piece of paper
he reads it and he goes okay here's the
argument here's the argument against it
not too interested yeah seems like a
problem but i got other things to do
puts it down that's it
that's all you got you you saw the
problem he didn't do anything about it
now imagine that the very person who is
most affected by
whatever this problem is is standing in
the oval office with him
and literally puts his hand on his
shoulder on the president's shoulder
and says to him look mr president
let's say it's biden for this example
look mr president
hand on shoulder
i need you to take this more seriously
i know you think the election was fair
but just
understand that i and 70 plus million
people
don't that that by itself is a problem
we don't you know it's not just a
question of what the votes were or were
not
the problem is half of us don't believe
it
hand on the shoulder you need to stop
what you're doing
you what i don't know what this other
stuff is on your desk
but mr president hand on shoulder
you need to stop that other stuff you
need to only work on this
this is our top priority now what does
biden do
in that situation does he respond
exactly the same way
as he did when he read it on a piece of
paper and thought he had other things to
do
nope nope this protest
is the people of the united states
standing in the oval office
figuratively speaking not literally with
their hand on the president's
shoulder telling the president
what our priorities are
because apparently they don't understand
this isn't a passing
phase this is the fundamental
fabric of the united states
and you up you up mr
president
mr president trump you blew this
there are better ways to handle this
congress absolutely
disgusting you're up
totally local governments
i don't know what the pluses and the
minuses are in the local stuff
but certainly in the key battleground
stage you up
you up big and if you keep
insulting us by telling us the up
wasn't that big i want to tell you as
clearly as you can hear this
we're going to be back in the oval
office we're going to put our hand on
your shoulder again
and we're going to remind you this is
our top priority
anything you're doing that isn't you
know national defense
this is your top priority not to
change the election necessarily
not to put trump in office and get rid
of biden that's not the top priority
the top priority is stop with us
about the basic nature of the
constitution
which is we need a little bit of
credibility we need a little bit of
comfort we need a little bit of feeling
like the government
cares about the people and if
that requires visiting
your house guess what the
capitol isn't your house it's
our house
if i go to your real house well that's
on me
i don't want to go to your real house
like you know if you live in the suburbs
you're a politician i'm not going to go
mess with your family your situation
that's
way out of bounds but the capital that's
our house
if you with us in our house
we're gonna visit you
but we're not gonna kill you we're not
gonna capture you we're not gonna
blackmail you
we're going to put a hand on your
shoulder and we're going to remind you
where your priorities are and if you
forget we're going to come back to your
 house
because it's our house and we're
going to remind you
again this isn't going to go away
the next election better be
better
transparent better be auditable if i
hear again that i can't see the software
on our voting machines or at least they
can't be audited by people who know what
they're doing
absolutely unacceptable
so let's plan today
that if our next election does not have
these obvious problems fixed
we'll be back in the capital literally
physically back in the capital
with a hand on the president's shoulder
by analogy not literally
just reminding him what the
priorities are
do you know who understood it trump
trump understood it now the way he
presents it
as a lot of hyperbole about fake
 claims of
fraud almost everything that the trump
that trump said about fraud isn't true
not even close uh pretty much i don't
think i've heard anything he said
that is confirmed to be true but
separate from that there are
allegations that do have weight in my
opinion
in the sense that nobody has debunked
them yet courts have not
nobody else has that i know of so
let's get to the bottom of this people
or
or we will visit again we will visit the
capitol again
 fix it and
let me say as clearly as possible all of
this is caused by fake news
if we had a real press all of these
issues would have been
uh worked out through the press
and we would have a completely different
feeling about what our situation is now
but because we don't have a real press
and they say
they they say things such as pro-trump
mob storm site after president's call to
arms
that never happened there was no call to
arms
it literally the opposite was true if
you don't have a free press
that is on your side and the free press
is not they're definitely not on your
side as a citizen
you don't really have a system that
works and the free press has this
special quality that they can blame
trump for whatever problems they caused
such as division within the country
would be the obvious one
they can blame somebody else and they
can sell it
and a lot of people bought it half of
the country bought what the fake news
was selling
and if we don't fix that
probably doesn't matter what else you do
fix if you don't fix the news
the citizens will be bouncing around
like idiots
because they won't know what's true and
that was true that's what happened this
year
2020 is what you get i mean
the coronavirus was a special problem
but 2020 with its craziness is what you
get when you don't have a free press
oh an honest free press and we don't
have that
that's the the basic problem
is the fake news you take that away
i don't believe the capital would have
been stormed
i don't um by the way
i think all of you know if you're
watching this
that i'm going to be taking uh quite a
bit of heat today
you know that right because i'm not
supposed to go in public
and say anything positive about the
protesters
i believe i will have to be punished for
that
but before that happens and if this is
the last that you see me on social media
i suppose anything's possible
let me say again you to every one
of you who
who thinks that this wasn't appropriate
to
put a little pressure on the government
this was the most
appropriate uh probably the most
appropriate thing i've ever seen
the citizens do i am completely proud
of the citizens who are doing this
completely now for the children and the
idiots
let me clarify again that i'm not in
favor of violence and destruction
so that part's all bad that
was that good for the idiots if if
you're an idiot or a child
do i need to explain that to you more
that it's okay to be opposed to the bad
parts and
and favor the good parts i know a lot of
people can't understand that that's a
little complicated
you can't have a complicated opinion but
my regular viewers i think
can handle that well
so let me let me say this about trump
because uh it's just i think it's time
i disavow trump's approach
to you know his communication style and
his approach
to how he's handled the outcome of the
election so
do i need to say that clear i disavow
trump's approach to this because i think
too much
too many fake allegations just ruined
everything
he had a real point but he ruined it
with all the fake allegations
here's how i disavow him though
with a healthy dose of humility and i
said this yesterday but it's worth
repeating
that there are times when i've thought
trump was too extreme
only to find out that he wasn't you know
north korea is an example negotiating
with china as an example
moving the embassy to jerusalem as an
example so he has a pretty long track
record
of doing things that i thought were too
risky
that seemed fine which means i probably
just
calculated the risk wrong or he got
really lucky i don't know which it's
more likely i calculated the risk wrong
so once again he's doing that which is a
pattern that
he's done successfully forever so if you
see trump doing something that seems too
risky and you see scott saying i'm gonna
have to disavow that that looks too
risky
just know that i'm doing it with
humility
that i'm well aware of the pattern that
he's usually right
in the end and i'm usually wrong
right if you can't say that out loud you
probably shouldn't talk in
public and give opinions
so here's one way he could be right
and i'm not on that side yet i'm still
disavowing his approach
but there is an explanation where it's
right
and he does use hyperbole to guarantee
that you can't look away
and he did take the most important
question in this country
and turned it into the most important
question in this country
if what happens because of this is more
election
reform than would have happened without
it
who's the smart one right
do you think that the way trump handled
that even with
me disavowing it the republicans
disavowing it
basically everybody right you know
people at least people from
every group are disavowing him but what
if
what if his you know inappropriate
behavior is the only thing that makes
the elections get fixed
because that's what focus the heat on it
if that's the only outcome
he's a legend he's a legend
because if you get me to turn on you
right i know you're thinking that right
if you see me turning on trump he's
taking a risk
and i just turned on i'm turning on him
right in front of you
i'm disavowing his approach but i can't
ignore
the fact that he does this successfully
time
after time after time and i can't ignore
the fact
that he's the only person who knew what
the top priority for the country was
at least in politics gonna have to give
that to him
at the same time that i disavow you know
the
allegations that that are obviously
false
yeah so
so you can see how much i'm going to get
attacked uh today after this
should be fun um
there's a doctor who's some expert on
narcissism
which is the funny part of this story uh
who is uh he's been trolling me on
twitter for the last 24 hours and he's
making the claim that not only am i a
narcissist
but that uh
that all of the the fraud claims have
been looked at by the courts and
rejected
now there's your problem with fake news
so you're saying that all of the fraud
allegations have been reviewed by the
courts and rejected
now of course republicans believe
exactly the opposite of that happened
that none of the fraud allegations were
dismissed
by any of the courts rather they
dismissed things for
uh technical reasons instead
now it is also true that's
uh some or most of those lawsuits
did not have evidence a fraud
you know lots of them were on
technicalities and constitutional
questions
so i am aware
i'm personally aware of a number of
allegations
that never made it into any kind of a
lawsuit now
here's one that i find strong because
somebody asked me give me a give me an
example of a
strong argument that did not make it
into any
court case and
i'll just give you one and it's just an
example
that would be that and i saw this on
i think it was robert barnes's uh
podcast with uh viva frey
and he was talking about how some
counties that were
demographically similar let's say there
are two counties they sit next to each
other
demographics are the same as they were
in the last election
and let's say in every election they
were you know
80 percent democrat or whatever it is if
one of them
suddenly becomes wildly different and
the other one acts just like it always
did
and they have the same demographics
that's a really strong indication that
there's something wrong with one of them
but if it were only one you could say ah
coincidence statistical oddity
is just one but apparently there are a
number of cases where
paired uh voting areas that
should have been really really close
because they always are
and nothing changed and it's the same
demographic same number of democrats
same number of you know racial
difference same age
everything and and there are a whole
bunch of pairs of those
where one went wild and one stayed kind
of where it was
now suppose you took that to a court
you said here are my statistics and when
i show you these irregularities
i believe mr judge
that the odds of this being a fair
election
are now you know .001 or whatever
not being a lawyer i ask you this
question because i have no idea what the
answer is
would the court say ah a statistical
proof
that's good you got it or would the
court say
all you've done with your statistical
evidence
is suggest maybe where you should look
into it
but if you don't have the thing in your
hand that's a document
or the video or the eyewitness you know
the things you normally have in court
if you don't have those things all you
have is some statistics
that could be explained another way in
other words it just might be a weird
year
or maybe they did you know better i
don't recruit
better get out the vote in one county
than another
right so i have a feeling
that uh and by the way i don't know that
that particular proof is the strongest
one
i'm just listing one that i know the
courts haven't looked at
can you give me a fact check on that
have the courts
ever heard that argument and then the
second part of that
if they did is it the sort of argument
that a court could ever buy into do they
buy into purely statistical arguments
without
some supporting direct evidence
i feel like they shouldn't but i don't
know if they might
you know maybe it's enough to say do a
re-election or a recount maybe
maybe if all you're asking for is a
recount or an audit
maybe it's enough i don't know
so
yes mrs judge let me let me correct it
mr or mrs judge
uh yeah somebody's saying that something
being unlikely
is not proof that something bad happened
so it could be
that we're in this weird situation where
there are
types of evidence which are completely
persuasive to the public
but because of the rules of law they
just don't fit
is that is that what's happening that's
a question not a statement
all right um
so here's how we can fix all of this
because this disagreement about what has
been
educated in the courts could be as
simple as a matrix that somebody would
have to do a lot of work to produce
and on one one column would be all of
the separate claims
you know claim about the shredding
ballots claim about this and that
the second column would be what the
argument against it is not in court just
the argument against it
so you can see the point and then the
counterpoint and then the third column
would be uh which courts have ruled on
this specifically
i think that column is blank but there
might be a few filled in
but if we had that a three column list
all the allegations in one column
all of the responses and debunks to them
in the second column
and then what did the court say about
any of these in the third column
none of this would be happening none of
this would be happening
because every time somebody would make
that argument and say the courts have
ruled on all this
you would just send them the spreadsheet
and say no actually the courts have
ruled on
two n of 50 things
here it is check it for yourself
right now why does that not exist
you know the reason right because we
don't have a
we don't have a press a news industry
we have a rumor bias industry
an entertainment industry but how much
work would it have taken for a reporter
to simply collect all the allegations
collect all the debunks or attempted
debunks of those allegations
and then list which court dealt with
which one
doesn't that seem well within the
ability
of a large news organization
i feel like that i feel like that should
have been a big story
nothing right because if that existed i
feel like we'd know about it
because somebody would have forwarded it
to be in twitter by now so the fact that
that
doesn't exist tells you
that that we don't have anything like a
news organization
but even worse now that you know that
the news has completely fallen down on
the most basic question
that the public wants to know about and
is completely discoverable by the way
i'm not talking about something that
can't be found
fairly easily it's just a lot of work
right it's just hours
there's nothing that would stop you from
finding it all you could literally
google every bit of that how much do
reporters like stories where they can
just google and that's it
they don't even have to talk to humans
and they still can't write it
just google it google it and write it
down oh my god
now so the press is bad what about the
republicans
you got a whole bunch of republicans you
know ted cruz etc
saying that the election has some
questions
why is there no republican who has
created
the chart with those three columns
because all they'd have to do is create
it
hand it to the press and say hey we did
your work
you better fact check it but i think
it's pretty good just
publish it do you know why that doesn't
exist
it's because politicians are not
competent if the republicans were
competent
that's the first thing they would have
done here's the list
here's what's been judged in court look
at the difference
but instead the republicans allow the
fake news
to create the story that has all been
judged by the court
like you couldn't you could not fail
harder than that
here's my claim i think i'll just ignore
it and talk about other things
what that's complete incompetence
the republicans should be creating that
list
and if the press won't do it just give
it to them put it on social media
that's all it's easy
um but if you're lazy it's hard i guess
so uh assange
had a little video so you know assange
has been the subject of you know maybe
uh
being uh brought to this country for
trial and that didn't work out
and then um of course there's a question
about
the pardon and i just saw a video of
assange
and i finally understand why they don't
want him free
they meaning i don't know deep state or
intelligence agencies or whoever it is
but in the video assange pointed out
that
all wars in the last 50 years are based
on media lies
and i thought to myself is that true
all of our wars in the last 50 years are
based on
the press lying to us and i thought to
myself
i can't really think of an exception
and assange points out that populations
don't like war
even if you've got a really good reason
they still don't like it
that the only way you can have a war and
this is the part that made my head fall
off
the only the only way you can have a war
in modern times
is by fooling the popul the population
you have to fool the population into war
otherwise it can't happen and
assange says that's the way it's been
for 50 years
the only wars in which the pub the
population doesn't know what's going on
can happen
now how much does that guy need to be in
jail forever
right because if you think you're living
in a military industrial complex
is supported by the fake news you would
say to yourself
uh there's a lot of profit in war
and those people who would make that lot
of profit
would like to sell that war to the
public how do they do it
they do it through the fake news the
fake news
creates uh you know public support
for a war and then the people who make
money selling war equipment
and other other ways to make money on
war
get rich and then the public thinks that
something like homeland defense happened
and nothing like that happened it was
literally some people
wanted to make some money who invented
some lies
fed it to the fake press fake press told
the population there was a reason for a
war
the population supported it the the
politicians that are corrupt
started the war and then the people who
had this plan
got rich
uh i don't think assange is going to get
pardoned
yeah or let me let me put it this way
trump is the only person with enough
balls to pardon assange
if it's not trump he's not going to get
pardoned by a subsequent president
you know you're not going to see it with
a biden or anybody who comes after him
trump is the only one who has balls big
enough to pardon assange
and should and should
um lastly i would like to point out i've
mentioned this a few times but it's so
useful that i want to do it again
there's
have you noticed that some books are
are good and some books are bad and some
books are just
okay but every now and then a book
becomes a
cultural social phenomenon
and it starts to change the actual
nature of
society i would say in search of
excellence years ago
by mike peters not mike peters tom
peters
uh was one of those that it was i think
it transformed the way we thought of
business it was a
phenomena and there are others you know
you could think of a half a dozen books
um
what was it uh the uh
you know the uh tools of uh
there's several others you can think of
but my book had failed almost everything
and still when big
has officially entered that territory um
arguably god's debris one of my other
books
is sort of a phenomenon but that seems
to be limited to like a a large
cult following so it's more like a cult
of phenomenon
cultivist in the sense just meaning a
limited number of people liking it not
an actual cult
but the uh the how to failed almost
everything book has entered the general
public's
thinking all the way from politics and
business
and and personal life in a way that
you know i have a front row seat to it
because people are sending me feedback
i've never seen anything like it
in terms of a book you know the reviews
are spectacular
in terms of a social phenomenon
it's picking up steam seven years after
it was published it's kind of crazy
what's happening
if you see the yeah seven habits of
highly successful people thank you
that's what i was trying to think of
that book i think was a social
phenomenon
and it lived forever on the best seller
list how to fail just
seems to have entered that phase this
year
i'd said when i wrote it when i first
wrote it i believed it would be what i
would be remembered for
i don't believe that dilbert will last
much after my
you know my death or my irrelevance but
i feel like they had a fail
book just entered some different kind of
phase
yeah and look at the in the comments
somebody says congratulations i bought
three copies
the the reason that i point that out is
that the number of people who have read
that book
three times is crazy
i don't know how many books you read
three times but
the most common comment i got is that
i'm reading it for the third time right
now
and have already implemented a bunch of
the the processes
so um i feel
uh there's no way to say what i just
said without sounding like a jerk making
a commercial
and that's not why you're here the
reason i do it is that the feedback from
that book
is so positive in terms of it actually
changing people's lives
not just entertainment but changing
people's lives
that i'm in this weird bind because i
hate doing
like over marketing even though you have
to sometimes
uh it just sort of is an ugly thing
but it's just too useful i just don't
feel like you should not hear about it
and
so i'll take that hit of looking like
the narcissist for a little while
all right that's all for now i will talk
to you
tomorrow
