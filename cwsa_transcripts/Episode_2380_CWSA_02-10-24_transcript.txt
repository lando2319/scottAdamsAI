[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams you've
never had a better time and if you'd
like to take it up a level that nobody
can even understand with their tiny
human brains all you need is a cup or
mug or glass a tager tankered chalice or
Stein a canteen Jugger flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go oh God that's
good so so
good well if you're not uh subscribed to
the Dilbert comic either on X you can
subscribe to it there or on the locals
um locals Scott adams. locals.com where
you can see lots of other stuff my other
Comics like robots read nudes Etc but
you missed uh yesterday's dilber comic
was uh Wall-E was trying to
expense uh his expenses when he traveled
to Leonia for the AI
brothel so w tries to expense an AI
brothel uh only to be challenged by the
boss
and when uh Wally complains that his his
choice of uh his sexual preferences are
being uh criticize the boss says no I
just wanted to let you know that there's
no such thing as a AI brothel in h
elbonia and while he says that would
explain the excess body hair so if you
if you're not subscribing to Dilbert
you're missing a lot so much just so
much let's talk about the news
apparently around
Chernobyl which uh I guess was 38 years
ago was a disaster at Chernobyl some of
the wolves have evolved into mutant
wolves who who are resistant to cancer
at least cancer that comes from
radiation so you didn't see that coming
did you that's right super radioactive
wolves could be our future might be the
only thing that that survives a nuclear
war
but it does raise the question what
other powers do these wolves have for
example can they fly in a way that
defies
physics because if they can that would
explain a lot about the UFOs it could be
just flying Chernobyl
wolves mutant wolves I mean you can't
rule it out is what I'm
saying um or possibly they um if they
start building pyramids that could be
another another hint about our history
but keep an eye on the mutant Chernobyl
wolves could be a lot more uh
interesting things possibly possibly a
superhero now here's here's the question
we know now that from the uh totally
reliable press in this country that Joe
Biden's age is not a defect have you
heard it is to quote them a superpower
it's a superpower so it makes you wonder
if Joe Biden were to have a fight with a
Chernobyl Mutan wolf that could survive
radioactivity who would
win would Joe win with his superpower of
being super old or would the wolf win
with his mutant Powers I don't know I'd
like to see it anyway you can't say you
wouldn't like to see
it all right uh payer
pay-per-view here's some science for you
do you believe science everybody science
is reliable so let me tell you some
science uh over in China they did a
study a single bind single bind study
with 342 participants and it found that
doing taiichi the traditional Chinese
practice they goes something like this
if you're only listening on a podcast
you're missing all the good visual humor
but uh apparently the
taii uh can definitely help your
hypertension so they compared it to
regular
exercise and they found out that the
traditional
taichi and will lower your blood
pressure now let us examine the
credibility of the science number one
the science comes out of China number
two it involves a traditional Chinese
practice so it comes from China and
they're trying to find out if a
traditional Chinese practice is good for
you oh surprise surprise the Chinese
study that's a single bind which is not
a double blind single blind so it's not
as good as a double blind and only had
342
participants
surprisingly supported the national
interests of China huh huh yeah not
single single blind not
bind so is this credible
science
no now it doesn't mean taiichi doesn't
lower your blood pressure maybe it does
but should you believe it if it's a
study of 342 people in China about a
traditional Chinese
practice I don't know I've Got a Feeling
if they studied traditional Chinese
acupuncture they might have gotten a
similar result if you know what I
mean all
right you know it's a really good
idea to do your own
research uh let me show you what happens
when you do your own
research here Dr uh Eli David is showing
us um on the xplatform he's posting
about
uh CH there's a graphic showing that
China is admitting more carbon then the
entire developed world
combined
so if you did your own research and you
tried to find out who's the worst pooter
you'd find out it was China so that
tells you something useful
right because you did your own research
yeah uh now let's do it on a per capita
basis uh China's got 1.43 billion people
United States has 342 million that means
the US is rough roughly 24% of their
population and yet the US is emitting
something like 40% of their
CO2 huh when you look at it that way
it's the
reverse if you look at it on a perers
basis the US is much
worse so what is the what's the
point is China worse than the us or is
the US worse than
China which which way is the fair way to
say it well some say China is a country
and the US is a country so you just
compare them they're doing they're doing
worse things to the world than we are so
they're bigger big deal they're doing
worse things to the world that is
correct they are but you don't think it
matters that they have more
people don't we naturally expect that
the more people there are the more CO2
if you live in any kind of a modernizing
society
so if you did your own research and
stopped at the raw number did you do a
good job of doing your own research or
do you think it really matters the per
person because if you try to figure out
who's the good people I would say it's
the people who have the smallest per
person
CO2 that's how I'd see it so so why
would you see it the other way could you
see it the other way you could you could
see it the other way so that's my point
um doing your own research will more
often mislead you than illuminate you
and you don't know the
difference sometimes doing your own
research gets you exactly the right
answer might even save your life the
trouble is you don't know when that's
happening and when you're just being
misled but you're pretty sure you're
right this
time um I see in the comments that you
want me to note that CO2 uh can feed
plants um such as Joe Biden and
vegetables I get it I see your joke I
will steal your joke all
right there's a Kentucky state senator
who wants a constitutional amendment to
ban non non-citizens from voting can you
believe this is even a
question that that we seriously talking
about not just letting ah let few of
those non-citizens vote I mean it's just
going to get lost in the noise anyway
but we have massive
immigration and we're going to let looks
like there's a movement in some states
to let them vote now how is that even in
the
conversation well how about we do a
little bit of
uh
um Embrace and
amplify so the Democrats are telling us
that that our system would be better off
if the illegal uh migrants vote what do
you think do you think our system would
be better off if
noncitizens who enter the United States
illegally
vote but suppose we suppose we take that
and amplify it what what if we embrace
it for a moment and say you know what
not only are you right about that but
you're so right we should do more of it
here's a little mental
mental experiment for you and this is
going to really this is going to break
your
brain suppose we let everybody vote in
the whole world literally everybody
you're a Chinese citizen you want to
vote in the next American election you
can and we'll count it you're in
Lithuania absolutely you can vote we'll
send you an electronic uh you know
ballot uh anywhere in South America
absolutely you vote now here's my
question which would be the better
result if Americans including you know
with our all of our division naturally
and then you throw in the the migrants
and we're going to get this real Insider
who wants power which group is you know
funding the bad guys the best uh who
does the military-industrial complex
want who's counting our votes you know
all that stuff now compare that to the
world that that would include our ad
adversaries our
adversaries literally our adversaries
let them vote in our election along with
our allies what would
happen well I think you might be
surprised because even our adversaries
don't want us to
fail if America went down everything
would be screwed for a long time they
don't want you know our adversaries
don't want us to attack them I get that
our adversaries don't want us to you
know take take their resources and stuff
like that that makes sense but I don't
think they want us to fail I think what
they want is us to be a legitimate
player on the world stage to do the
thing that America does you know invent
new technologies and create medicines
that aren't always a scam that sort of
thing you know get to space you know
create some Elon musks now and then you
know they like that
stuff I I propose to you that I don't
this is not a serious uh suggestion by
the way but if we let every other
country vote for America's president
that we would vastly improve our
choices just look at it look look at
what we're look at the two choices we
gave ourselves with our current
system do you think the rest of the
world would have put up with that do you
think that Biden would actually be in
the race if the rest of the world got to
choose our president
no no it's possible that none of the
people were in the race would be in it
they'd probably pick somebody who was
just a good you know a good operator who
wasn't too political who just did stuff
that made sense yeah yeah they'd
probably vote for some well Elon can't
run but they they probably vote for well
I don't know about aake he's you know
he's certainly is aligned with one
political party but they probably picked
somebody who wasn't too political who
just knew how to get stuff done so we'd
stay yeah maybe Rond to santis that's
not that's not too far somebody in the
middle
midd anyway our current system is so
broken that letting the rest of the
world vote I believe in all seriousness
it's not a serious suggestion but as a
mental exercise I think the world would
vote us a better
president because look what we're doing
I mean
really look what we're doing there's no
way it would be worse
all right I'm going to take a minor
partial Victory lap um you might know
the ACT actor and activist Michael rapor
is he's been making some news he was on
the Tim pool show was talking about him
and others he was on uh oh I can't why
can't I remember his
initials
dbe pbd
pbd I I'll never be able to remember his
initials I don't know why oh it's
because the p and the B and the D oh I
got it I'm
dyslexic look at the letters the
lowercase letter p b and d
lowercase they're all the same letter PB
and D are all the same letter they're
just upside down and backwards you see
that I just realized why I could never
get his
name yeah if I remembered his full name
it'd be easier no but PB and D in lower
case are all the same letter I actually
can't see it they all they all just jump
around when I look at them I never
realized that before but that's I think
that's the problem well that in the fact
that my brain is corroding faster than
Biden's anyway mapor is coming out and
saying that he was initially fooled by
the fine people hoax and he actually
believed that Trump had said those
neo-nazis were fine people and now he's
going public and saying he knows that
that was taking context and when you see
the full quote it's obvious he said the
opposite of that
and here's what's amazing about
it the fine people hoax in my opinion
was the second biggest political hoax of
my
time the second biggest the Russian
collusion was bigger but it was the
second biggest political hoax and it is
now being
treated at least on the right-leaning
side of the world is being treated as
simply a a fact that it was a
hoax when when you watch the Tim pool
show there's nobody on the other side
saying oh but but but he did say it
we're actually past that there's nobody
arguing he actually said it unless you
just unless you have actually just
batshit crazy Democrats so I'd like to
give now I do think that this hoax is an
evergreen if you wait two years it'll
just revive itself and somebody will
believe it happened again but at the
moment it's beaten down by than I've
seen it beaten down so big shout out to
Steve Cortez who's been working against
that hoax for years now and Joel Pollock
also and breit Bart especially in
tweeting um and posting and and then um
I of course have been a maniac about it
so I would say that the three Horsemen
of the debunking of that
hoax we may have made a may have made a
difference by the way let me ask you do
you you think that do you think it would
be commonly understood that it was a
hoax even on the right do you think it
would be commonly understood without
debate if the three of us had not been
pushing on it for seven
years I think it made a difference yeah
like I I never know what makes a
difference but seven years of just
maniacally pushing back on that thing at
least speaking for
myself uh I think it made some
difference but only on the right
on the people on the left don't get real
news so they have no
idea all right so uh no surprise here
but the Democrats are pulling out some
law fair against RFK
Jr and it looks like they're accusing
him of illegal
activities I don't know something about
a Super PAC it's probably and
now they've opened a federal
investigation to remove him from the
ballot come
on how do the Democrats not see what's
happening
now how how can you not see what's going
on they don't get the news if they saw
the same news we do maybe they'd see the
same thing but uh yeah that's
disgusting um and you know what's funny
about it is that and I'll give RFK Jr
some credit if you look at RFK Jr's
character and his life of work now that
doesn't mean everything he's ever said
about vaccinations is true because I
doubt it you know very it's very unusual
everybody would be true about you know
that domain um but I swear I never I
never really suspect him of
intentionally
lying I just don't see it I mean he's
been talking about a lot of things for a
long time and I'm looking for the
lies now there might be things he's Inc
wed about not not going to argue that at
all
but um if you compare the Biden
Administration to RFK Jr I don't even
need to look at the details of this
story do you have is everybody having
the same impression I'm just going to
take his word for it that it's
illegitimate because I think he earned
that does anybody
disagree I I think that uh the Democrats
and Biden his credibility is so low and
RFK Juniors is so high not not in terms
of being technically correct about
everything he's ever said but just not
lying that if he says there was no crime
and he says they're coming after him for
political reasons I believe that and I
don't even need to hear anything else
because that's the difference in
credibility one is very high credibility
and the other is a known serial liar for
150 years so those are not really
similar um Senator ran
Paul um is responding to Joe Biden who
said that it's quote close to criminal
neglect if Congress doesn't uh send
money to
Ukraine close to criminal neglect if we
don't fund an Ukraine Ukraine's border
war and uh Rand Paul Senator ran Paul
reminds us I would say his criminal
neglect for Mitch McConnell Chuck suumer
and Joe Biden to get together to send
100 billion overseas to fix someone
else's border before addressing our
border yeah that does seem criminal and
actually Trump said something like that
in his speech in Harrisburg I
guess um that he thinks that the people
who are not closing the
border that maybe there should be some
criminal
liability now I don't think so I doubt
there's any criminal liability and I'm
not really big on looking for crimes
where they're not obvious
but it does seem that
important it does seem like it's on that
level of a gigantic crime even if it's
not technically a crime if it's just
people not doing their job or something
so it's that important I doubt it's an
actual crime uh all right are you having
fun watching uh Biden's supporters
trying to uh trying to explain
away all of his mental problems does
anybody else think it's hilarious at
this
point you know I always used to make fun
of the old thing in politics there's
always somebody saying oh the emperor
has no clothes the emperor has no
clothes and I always go g GH it's like
soil and green it's like it's like the
obvious thing everybody says in every
situation the emperor has no clothes but
I've never seen it fit so
well yeah you you've got obviously a
bumbling who's clearly mentally
you know
disintegrated and they're they're trying
to sell us on the fact that he's all
there this is the first time I've seen
an exact perfect example of The
Emperor's New Clothes because I always
thought well if you had an EMP who
literally wore no
clothes there's no way that you wouldn't
mention it like it's not
realistic but we actually have a
situation where everybody can see he's
mentally degraded and his supporters are
looking you right in the eyes and saying
no he's
not
no no he's wearing all of his
clothes and he's not mentally
degraded now do you see me doing the
Democrat lying
strategy there there are three things to
look for you look for the eyes get
wide you look for the chin goes up a
little bit and you look for the smile
that doesn't match the
faith do you want to see it
again I give you uh kamla
Harris defending Joe Biden
I'm going to play it with the sound
off I want you to see if you can spot
the point where she tells the lie and
the LIE is that Joe Biden is fine
there's nothing problem right so watch
your face until the moment she gets to
the LIE look for the eyes widen chin
goes up and the smile that doesn't match
the face watch for
it I want you to I Want You To indicate
when you see the LIE there's no sound
let's see see if I can get it so you can
both see it at the same
time watch for the eyes to get big in a
minute hope I didn't miss it did I miss
it
yet oh I think I missed
it let's do it
again all right eyes
normal head
normal eyes and face
match there it is there it
is did you catch
it see if I can fast forward
it it's hard to catch the moment but did
you catch it you play back yourself and
catch it
yeah but it's funny once you see it it's
so obvious it just jumps right
out um so here are the defenses that are
the people are giving one is that Trump
confuses names
too Trump confuses names too and then
they show some video of him now is that
fair is that fair to say Trump confuses
his names
too I think it is yeah I think it's fair
because in my opinion the the Biden when
Biden confuses
names in his case it probably is because
of dementia but it's also true that
people confuse names routinely it's a
very normal thing to do all right now in
fact this is a sort of a confession of
mine I've always fantasized like what
would it be like to be president and I
thought I wonder could I ever be a
president and I realized that I probably
couldn't because of all the names of
foreign leaders I would get wrong I mean
I I have a real problem with it let let
me give you an
example if uh I were being being visited
by L say the leader of
Afghanistan I'm not sure I would know
that hibatul
akanda um I wouldn't know him from Bin's
shik hammad bin assal Khalifa I mean I I
saw I wouldn't even know the difference
at
all
um so
yeah yeah I'd be all which one is that
is that
hiah or is that uh
is
alai I can't even tell them
apart you know so that's one of the
reasons I can't be president because I
can't tell all the leaders
apart uh I used to think but apparently
not being able to tell the leaders apart
will not hurt you for being president so
we got a Biden we got a trump barely
that's not now the other thing that I
thought would prevent me from someday
being president is all of my uh
grabbing but now I have evidence to
suggest that I could grab a bunch of
 confuse the names of uh hibatullah
akand and alifa and I still be able to
be a president and that's I find that
motivating so here are some other things
that people are saying to defend Biden
um stenhammer was funny he posted today
show show me a video a recent video of
Joe Biden stuttering
because they're saying don't make fun of
him for his stuttering I mean but do we
have any video of him let's say from 10
years ago when he was perfectly fine was
he stuttering 10 years ago I don't
remember it I have no no memory of him
ever stuttering 10 years ago but now
suddenly he stutters like he did when he
was a kid huh and then Rachel M points
out that he rides a
bike yeah
she she uh says he rides a bike
now are we at the point where there's
literally no difference between reality
and
parody If I had told you that a
comedian had told you that uh Joe Biden
is perfectly fine because hey look at
how he rides a bike wouldn't you think
that that real comedian said that as a
joke but that's actually what Rachel M
said in the real world in the actual
real world outside of humor she said
that he's probably fine because he can
ride a
bike apparently he can ride it right
into the
ground she didn't say she didn't say
where he rides it to he rides it right
to the ground but at least he's riding
it and then there's the argument that K
makes that uh um Joe Biden is is
actually totally mentally capable which
certainly raises an interesting question
doesn't it which others have raised wait
a minute if the reason he's not being
prosecuted seems to be largely around
his mental
incapacity if you're arguing that he
does have good mental capacity aren't
you also arguing he should be in
jail now you're going to say to me wait
a minute wait a
minute um you're going to say there's a
complete difference between uh what
Trump did and what Biden did because
Biden um simply said that he was
couldn't remember and he's incapable and
he didn't didn't willfully do anything
with those documents but they believe
that Trump is mentally capable and he
also resisted giving those documents
back so therefore it's his resistance
that's the real
crime are you hearing the the Democrats
say
that
well here's the funny
part do you know what what they could
say that would be terribly persuasive
but they can't form sentences and get
the sound of their mouth like literally
they can't say it but it would be so
persuasive if they if they could here's
what they can't
say because of TDS
yes if Trump had not
resisted we think that he should not be
charged with anything regarding the
possession of the
documents now if they said that I would
say oh well that's very consistent yeah
Biden wasn't
charged because because not just because
he's mentally incapable but because he
didn't resist when they asked him back
and he accept the process which
apparently is not that unusual to have a
process to get back documents from an
official whereas uh whereas Trump he
resisted but here's the better way to
say it if you really wanted to persuade
me you'd say you know what if you're a
Democrat you'd say um yes Biden did not
get charged because he obeyed the system
we also believe that if Trump had obeyed
the system the same way we also think he
should not be
charged the same way do you know why
they can't say
that TDS it would be perfectly
persuasive if you said that to me I'd
say you know what that's actually a
solid argument that one resisted and one
didn't so maybe it is the resistance
that's the problem but they've got to
say it directly if Trump had not
resisted he should also not be charged
charged for having the
documents but you know why they can't
say
that the reason they can't say that is
it would
give imaginary mental cover to Trump
imaginary because in the real world he
did
resist everybody agrees he resisted so
they can't even they can't even do a
hypothetical mental experiment which
allowed Trump to go free in their mind
and I mean this I mean they can't say
the the persuasive thing because in
doing so they would have to imagine
Trump innocent of something and they
actually can't go there literally can't
go there because their brains won't
allow it so instead they're they're
closed off from their best argument for
Biden which is you know what if Trump
had given all the documents back I don't
think the possession of the documents
should have been
charged
and you remember they made such a big
deal about the contents of uh Trump's
documents do you remember that it was
all about the
contents and that they they must have
the nuclear secrets in there and then
when Biden's documents were discovered
do you recall anybody characterizing the
contents I don't recall that ever being
done so we suddenly don't care about the
contents after mons and months of the
Democrats saying the contents are
probably well we don't know but I'm just
speculating that it's Iranian nuclear
secrets the dumbest speculation you
could ever
have like I don't think do do you think
that a staffer or even Trump himself
packed up some sensitive nuclear secrets
and just took them with them I mean I
suppose anything's possible but that
seems unlikely to me it seems that both
Biden and Trump probably had documents
that were technically you know
inappropriate to take home but maybe not
that dangerous like in the in the final
analysis probably not too dangerous so
suddenly we just stopped talking about
the
contents we just stop talking about it
and that's why it's embarrassing if
you're a Democrat if you made a big deal
about the contents being the important
part now you you lost that argument
so is Biden fit to stand trial in which
case he should or is he
unfit
um let's talk about Tucker and
Putin remember you you mostly disagreed
with me when I said that Putin's uh
history lesson about why Russia thinks
it should have some um control over
parts of Ukraine or all of it um I said
that he looked unhinged and it didn't
look very capable to
me because the history lesson is not
persuasive to
Americans I'm going to revise
that all right I'm going to completely
reverse it actually but not for the
reason you think I still say that the
history lesson had no value to Americans
in other words the details of his
history lesson had zero persuasive
effect on any American probably any
European but I'm not going to say it had
no
value and I'm going to I'm going to fool
you here because you don't see this
coming just wait for
it but I saw that Tucker also um
regarded the history lesson as
incoherent he actually used that word so
Tucker agreed with me that the History
part just didn't seem
connected really to the answer in in a
tight enough way that it looked like he
was
coherent
now uh but wait for the end I'm I'm
going to support Putin's
play you know so don't criticize me yet
I'm going to support Putin's play on the
history lesson but not for the reason
you think right different
reason
um so and then I saw some people think
that uh Putin was personally hurt by
being rebuffed by the West you know
every time you wanted to be friends I
don't know if any of that's true we
can't read his mind so I wouldn't
there but maybe maybe he's personally
hurt I don't know if that affected
anything um but here here's uh my
defense of
Putin it took me a while to figure this
out because the thing I was having
trouble reconciling is that Putin is so
capable and would know so much about
persuasion especially have you know
given his background that to do
something that is so wrong persuasion
wise it made me question is
sanity until I re realized what the real
play was and now I don't question the
sanity it was a really good play you
don't realize why but I'm going to tell
you um those of you who are my longtime
listeners uh can confirm that this is
something I've talked about before and
actually in some detail and I've said
I've used the technique myself let's say
you're negotiating with somebody and
it's just a business
negotiation and uh you want a good price
and they want to get a good price and
it's just
business if it's just business you
almost know before you start where it's
going to end up don't you like even
before you start you're going to ask for
something too much I'm going to say too
little we're going to meet in the middle
and in the end it's going going to look
like similar business deals because
everybody in business knows that if you
started with a first offer that was so
far out of the normal business realm
nobody would even negotiate with you so
you start by saying what do we assume is
possible and then you're within that
realm and you can always you know get to
a get to a Meeting of Minds if it's just
Financial you can almost always make it
work
now what would be an argument in which
that doesn't work where you're just both
being rational you're both being within
the rational
domain it's when something's
irrational this is an actual persuasion
negotiating technique which I have used
it goes like this if you can convince
the other side that your reasoning is
irrational at least in in any individual
point of it not the whole thing if
you're just totally irrational they
won't deal with you but if you could say
I'm rational about everything but
honestly I'm going to point out this one
thing and I'm going to tell you as
directly as I can I'm not going to be
rational about this and here's
why if you could make that
case you almost win the negotiation from
that point
on you have to sell your own
irrationality that sounds backwards
doesn't it that if you're negotiating
with somebody you have to convince them
that you are
irrational doesn't that sound
crazy nope it's what Trump does all the
time do you think that when uh when
Trump said I might nuke ma
Moscow do you think that sounded
rational nope it didn't sound rational
so Putin couldn't be sure that that was
something he could negotiate because it
wasn't based on something rational who
the hell would nuke
Moscow it would literally be crazy so
how do you even deal with that what do
you do with that well the first thing
you do is you say all right I can't deal
with crazy so I'm going to have to work
with whatever I can work with but I know
I can't change crazy and then Trump
won because you can't deal with crazy
you can't negotiate with an irrational
component doesn't mean the person is
rational in general but there might be
an irrational component let me give you
an
example for my real life when my
syndication contract which was
originally a 15-year deal expired I
thought to myself hey I'm a free agent
I'll go negotiate a better deal than I
ever had because I can negotiate with
other syndication companies the
syndicator is who sells it to newspapers
and you split the money so I thought I
would do that but then my syndicate
company reminded me hey there was a
clause in your original contract that
says even at the end of it if you go
work with somebody else we still get a
portion of your
money and I said what yeah after 15
years your new
work we would still get paid for even if
we have nothing to do with with you if
you've gone to another company it says
that right in your contract and I said
it couldn't possibly say
that there's no way I would have signed
that contract and they looked at the
contract it was
there just like they said and I don't
know why did I forget it like I actually
don't know why I didn't know it was
there so here's what I could do I could
either take a big loss and go with the
same company that I went with for 15
years which I which had been a really
good
relationship uh but I would leave a lot
of money on the table if I couldn't go
to the free market and negotiate my
actual value so you know how I
negotiated out of that
Clause
irrationally intentionally
irrationally I looked the head of the
Syndicate in the eyes over lunch and I
said basically in these words your
contract is very
clear I will quit the business before
I'll sign it
now I was at the height of my powers and
quitting at that point would have been
absolutely stupid and I looked them in
the eyes and I said this is so up
that I'll quit the business before I
will agree with this now if he believed
I would not quit the business which
would have been the more rational thing
to do obviously because all I had to do
is sign up with them again and they
would just start throwing money at me
like they did before and everything
would be fine so the most rational thing
to do was say oh damn I made a mistake I
never should have signed it but I did
and my life would go on i' still make a
lot of money they'd be happy Etc that
would have been the rational thing to do
so to get out of that I went fully
irrational and I had to sell that I
would myself up and down backwards
and forwards I would kill my family I
would break a law but I wasn't going to
sign that
contract in the end
they were convinced that there was
nothing they could do to get me to sign
it and then I reached a very good deal
and I ended up I did sign with them but
not until they gave me a much better uh
situation and in the end I ended up
going to another Syndicate from um you
know just a business combination that
happened
later now let's go back to Biden so you
see that you see the idea right and the
irrational negotiating position is
actually your strongest one so long as
you seem to be rational in general Putin
seems to be rational in general and then
he gave you that long weird
incoherent history
lesson what was the only thing he needed
you to
know do you remember the dates and the
names and who no NOP does he need you to
remember the history no NOP does he need
you to think that the history is a valid
reason for whatever he's doing no he
doesn't need you does he need you to
believe that the history is accurate No
nope doesn't need that does he need you
to agree with him about the history NOP
no he only needs one thing and he got
it he only needed one thing to win the
negotiations that are upcoming cuz he
knows they're upcoming and he got it and
the one thing he needed was for the West
to
believe that he would burn down Europe
before he would give up on
this and he did he sold
it he sold that now he didn't say it in
those
words but he sure he sure sold it he
sold that the the Russian heart
is what has to be
satisfied we can't do that we we have no
tools for that we can't rebuild you a
pipeline you hey we'll put your pipeline
back together no that doesn't help my
heart not even a little bit well we'll
negotiate you know you keep this we'll
keep that doesn't help my
heart what are you going to do it he may
have Putin success sucessfully
established that there's part of the
negotiations that are off they're just
off the
table by simply telling us we're not
going to be rational about this in the
way that you and I would think would be
rational but in
fact he's hyper
rational it was kind of
brilliant the the fact that he used and
I'm going to say used because you know
Tucker was using Putin but Putin was
using Tucker as long as it's transparent
I don't mind it a bit actually you know
that was transparent it was right in
front of us like the entire intention of
it was to show you all of it how could I
be mad at that transparency is the best
we can do folks if you have full
transparency you could wish it were
better but it can't be better that's
just the best you could do and that was
full
transparency am am I such an idiot that
I think uh Putin told me the truth
no no I don't think Putin told me the
truth not a not even a little
bit do I think that uh Tucker asked
every hard question that he wanted to
ask no no because he still had to
survive so the uh so my take on this is
that Putin won the interaction in the
sense that he established an irrational
point of negotiation that will help him
in the future and at some point the the
West will back down because he sold it
so
well the whole incoherent part the whole
fact that he he made you listen to it
first before he'd even ask that the way
he handled the whole thing is all
supportive of the fact that he has an
irrational connection to it and that was
the sale and we all bought it nicely
done Putin
nicely done now it is possible he's just
a crazy babbling old guy talked about
history that's not impossible but given
that everything else he does seems to
make sense it would be weird if this is
the one thing that was
completely you know
accidental so I do believe that that the
uh um his belief about history is
probably you know it's real I think he's
motivated by it but far more important
and than his motivation is that he sold
the fact that he's not going to be
dealing with that like rational things
very well done
negotiator now let's talk about the
opposite so one of the things that came
out of that interview with Tucker and
Putin was the claim that there was some
movement toward negotiated peace that
Boris Johnson killed and talked to
seninsky out of it uh Boris Johnson is
very angry at that interview and among
the things she says are
that uh that Tucker was a quote foring
gooing and had a slack Jord happiness at
having a
scoop and Johnson says that uh Tucker
betrayed his viewers around the world he
said he didn't ask tough questions
didn't ask Putin why even now he is
using the most brutal means of Modern
Warfare to m murder innocent Ukrainian
civilians and then he said Carlson acted
like a fan of Putin and quote boneheaded
accepted Putin's mixture of semi
masticated Wikipedia and outright
falsehoods Johnson
said and he went on he said not since
George Galloway I have no idea who that
is but not since George Galloway went to
Baghdad and hail the in indefatigable
Inda God damn you Johnson can you use
words that are a little bit smaller than
this I know you showing off but I don't
need to take four runs at this one
goddamn word
indefatigability IND
indefatigability in
indefatigability of uh Saddam Hussein
have we seen such a display of this is
actually something Johnson said of bum
sucking cility to a
tyrant and said Carl was just the medium
the sewer the hose for Putin to spread
his message to
America so is that good uh
persuasion how did Boris Johnson do
defending himself against the
accusations uh did you hear the part
where he said the accusations are not
true he he left that part out he left
out the part about the accusations are
not
true shouldn't that be
first here here here's what I would
consider a good
response well you know pun's a liar and
the thing he said happened literally
didn't even
happen that never even
happened and and and uh Tucker should
have been more critical about that
because he's you know just F it's just
fake
news
but instead he decided to destroy
Tucker's personal
credibility who does that if they can
just go after the fact nobody does an ad
homonym first if they can just say the
thing didn't happen now if you say the
thing didn't happen and then you go on
and insult the person then you're just
Trump right but when when Trump insults
people it's usually over a thing like a
policy a thing right it it's not just a
whole bunch of
insults and he looked a little unhinged
and
uh I think if you do a
full-on um personal attack and you don't
do more of a just a matter of fact
denial of the facts behind it you can't
really Fail Harder than
that to me it looked like another Putin
victory
over the West um my my current thinking
is that everything the West did in
Ukraine was wrong and that you know I
I'm not going to support
Putin but I can just talk about my own
side everything my side did looks wrong
from the 2014 coup to today it all looks
wrong to me so I don't have to say
Putin's good or Putin's right or
anything like that but when Johnson says
that what Tucker should have talked
about is how there's maming and
murdering of ukrainians by
Russia really I mean that's so
transparently just trying to change the
topic that it's like a almost like a
confirmation of the accusation that he
denied a chance to have peace I don't
know if it's true but the way he's
reacting to it as if is as if it's
true all right uh so apparently the
house Judiciary Committee is going after
this uh district attorney fonnie Willis
who's after Trump as you know so it's
not a coincidence that they would go
after her because she's after Trump but
um what are they trying to get uh
they're trying to figure out if she use
federal funds
illegally for boyfriend or whatever now
I would like to suggest the following
strategy
does it seem to you that a lot of these
Soros backed prosecutors and
Das does it look like they're all
corrupt that they're all using public
money for their boyfriends or
something so would it make sense for the
Republicans to uh since they have that
big legal fund that Steven Miller's
doing wouldn't it make sense to Simply
uh investigate every one of the Soros um
da
to Target them for
lawfare and just take them out with
lawfare because you could actually take
down the whole Soros Network by
targeting them one after another and
just really go horribly at them now keep
keep in mind under a situation of normal
politics I would never suggest this I
don't think you should be going looking
for crimes that's the worst freaking
thing you could do in America but the
Soros prosecutors I consider an invasion
to me that's an unfriendly Force
operating domestically I it's almost
like domestic terrorism so under the
under the sense that it's not almost it
is domestic terrorism it is domestic
terrorism it is they they're operating
as domestic terrorists because they're
hunting Republicans and I'm I'm
literally afraid of being locked up for
not doing anything illegal so that's
exactly terrorism making people afraid
to do legal
things in their world because they think
this horrible person will put them in
jail so this is I would put uh I would
put a billion dollars behind this if I
had a billion dollars to fund an
absolute investigation of every Doro
Soros
funded candidate and anybody anybody who
takes money from a Soros entity should
know that their underwear is going to be
turned upside down down and that the
Republicans will Target them only
because of the Soros connection not
because they're
Democrats If This Were happening just
because they're Democrats absolutely no
absolutely no I do not approve of just
looking for crimes because somebody's a
Democrat no no no no no don't do that
but because they're Soros funded and
they seem to be fitting a pattern of
domestic terrorism in the sense of Al
you misusing the legal system I think
that they they are completely legitimate
targets for
lawfare completely legitimate and I
wouldn't use lawfare in any other
situation unless it was you know
something that looks like literally
terrorism or an attack on our on our
nation so yeah law fair it
up
um K Harris uh was talking to some folks
some uh class of Future Leaders and she
said this and it is it's so brilliant it
will probably be quoted much like the
Martin Luther King you know I had a
dream possibly like Abe Lincoln a four
score 20 years ago maybe like Kennedy Cy
ask you know ask not what your country
can do for you but somewhere in that
category is
this the Brilliance of this inaugural
class and its leaders is the ability to
see what can
be unburdened by what has been and then
to make it
real I don't know has anybody ever said
that before yes it's the only thing she
says every time she goes anywhere
because if you haven't heard it before
it sounds kind of awesome if you've
heard it over and over again
it gets less awesome every time you hear
it so um I would like to suggest that
the funniest thing about
2024 is watching Dei destroy the
Democratic party because that's what's
happening so Dei as you know would be
the favoring of you know minority and
women over white men primarily but also
Asian
Americans and in this case Dei caused
the Democrats to hire KL Harris as the
vice president and I don't think there's
anybody listening to this who would
disagree that she's a Dei hire is that
is that fair because I can't imagine it
was because of
capability right would everybody agree
that she's a Dei hire and it's obvious
right now likewise just to be fair if
Trump picked Tim Scott I would say
that's a Dei
hire even though Tim Scott's a solid
senator would you agree I mean it would
be sort of too on the nose I was like
okay all right it's because you're black
right now if if Trump picked as his vice
president um V
ramaswami I would not say it's because
he's brown I would say we just watched
him impress the country with the best
communication skills and political
policies I've ever seen right so it
would be hard to sell that one as a some
kind of a you know minority Dei thing
that would be a genuine case of the I'll
call it the bill Amman style of
diversity or really what Mark cubin
wishes it were but it isn't which is you
pick the best person and whoa they're
brown
too then you get yourself some free
diversity but if you're not getting it
for
free then it's a Dei hire Tim Scott's
solid Tim Tim Scott is solid but you
would see it as a Dei hire because he's
not of aake right if a didn't exist I
might feel differently he such an
obvious better
choice so here's what makes it funny
because kamla Harris CA Harris was hired
as vice
president
um Biden can't
quit because everybody knows that she's
too weak to take over for the president
which was the entire point of a vice
president the entire point is you have
to be smart you know good enough to take
over now you could argue that Pence you
know wasn't as strong as Trump but you
know what he could have taken
over you know you could imagine him
winning an election I could I could
imagine it but you know I don't he's not
it wouldn't be my choice for president
either but you could imagine it he's
like he's a serious person right um but
kamla I don't even think the Democrats
think she has a chance or would be the
right person for
president um so they've gotten
themselves in a bind where they can't
get rid of Biden and they also can't win
with
him they can't get rid of him and they
can't win and it's only going to get
worse because he will keep degrading
between now and election day in
theory uh the de Dei hire should make
Biden lose bad when in fact it would be
an obvious solution if she were a strong
candidate right the obvious solution
would be oh well kamla can take over and
I'm not feeling so good and she could
win this election as easily as I could
go ahead obvious an obvious solution but
they can't do it because they hired klin
they can't fire her can't replace her
with another black woman can you imagine
that can you imagine CU some people say
that Michelle Obama let me tell you why
Michelle Obama can't
happen 100% can't happen you're not
going to replace a black woman with
another black
woman it would make it look like the
whole thing was a
joke you kind of looks like that now but
no you're not going to do
it so here's what I think is going to
happen K Harris got hired as a Dei hire
she's made it impossible for them to win
the presidency
and if you lose a presidency that hard
usually has a down vote down ballot
effect right am I
right I mean usually that people don't
say we like all the Democrats for
congress but we want a Republican
president at the same time you know on
the same ballot they don't usually say
that so it's more likely they're going
to say you know what let's give the
Republicans a shot or you know what
let's just not vote this
time um you don't have to shout at me
that she's uh half black and half Indian
I know it but in the real world she's
considered black for political
reasons but I I understand there it's
the same as calling Obama black in my
mind he's never been black not a single
day do you
agree in my mind Obama's never been
black even
once he he's a person who is Part White
and part
black and he's chosen that black is his
better uh
branding because you know why because
claiming you're white is a
disadvantage no better example right now
obviously he claimed he's white nobody
would believe it but he can claim he's
black and people are like oh
okay like where does that come
from what why why can he claim he's
black
when you're half black like who makes
those
rules and by the way I don't mind like
it it's perfectly fair but like where
does that come from that we all just
accept that that's like a normal thing
to do like you you just ignore half of
them why does that make sense is it
because society would treat him as
black which is a fair point it's a fair
the same point I make with um uh with
kamla I think that the non-indian public
just treats her as black which is not
accurate
either all right
um so President Biden uh one of the ways
he likes to prove that he's not mentally
incompetent is sending other people out
to argue that he's not mentally
incompetent because that's how you do it
right if you want to prove that you can
speak in public in a capable way you
send other people to speak for you in
public to say that if you were there you
could actually make sense but you're not
there because that's very
persuasive oh yeah I guess he could just
pick up his phone and point it at his
face proves coherent simply by talking
into his phone for 15 seconds and then
posting it I mean that would do it but
instead he's going to send out an army
of people who are not him to say that
behind closed doors he's totally lucid
I don't see how that could be less
persuasive but something good came from
it which is his lawyer saying that uh
the the special what is it the
prosecutor guy
her uh went beyond his
remit I was listening to that in the car
and I heard the lawyer say that the they
think that the special prosecutor went
beyond his remit you know what the first
thing I said to myself was
mental note keep that word for later I'm
totally going to say something went
beyond his
remit maybe before the end of this live
stream because I like it so much it
sounded so smart I heard him say and I
believe he wouldn't past his remit and I
was like
what what I'm totally using
that
so you can make comments here sure but
don't go beyond your
remit all right um yeah and the real
problem is that he pointed it out not
that it's
true the real we're we're acting like
the real problem is that the special
prosecutor pointed out that Biden is
mentally
degraded I feel like the reality should
be the only conversation here didn't he
get it wrong and and and the thought
that if that's what the special
prosecutor really thought and believed
how in the world is that not
relevant that's pretty
relevant I'm seeing a dad joke which I'm
going to repeat that the definition of
remit is when Mitt Romney runs for
president yet again you're remitting
yeah not bad be
minus all right
um Trump's talking about uh Biden's
classified documents and he says if
Biden's not going to be charged then I
should not be charged this is nothing
more than selective
prosecution well now the Democrats would
argue it's not about the documents it's
about the resisting of the process for
giving them back but is it good
persuasion for Trump to ignore that fine
point and just say hey it's documents we
should be treated the same it is it's
not
honest
it's not honest because if we were being
honest he'd say okay A little bit of is
about my you know resisting giving them
back but he should also say if you're
being honest we thought we had a like a
legal process going you know we were in
conversations you know probably could
have been resolved um but it's good
persuasion because the country doesn't
know the difference between those two
cases and no matter how many times MSNBC
explains no it's not about the documents
oh yes we were complaining about it was
just about the documents before but now
now it's not about just the documents
now it's about the process nobody
listens the average voter is just going
to look at those two situations and say
they look alike to me they both took
documents one got away with it one
didn't that's what it's going to look
like right so yes Trump's uh Instinct on
persuasion is exactly right it's exactly
right it's not fully honest but it's
very
persuasive all
right and uh Trump said about the Border
bill that uh I think I mentioned this
that
uh the if the Senate wants to pass a
real border bill they should establish
criminal penalties for senior Biden
officials who refuse to enforce the
existing
law now I have two thoughts about that
I don't think you
want
crimes for not doing your
job I feel like that's a bad precedent
because everybody accuses everybody of
not doing their job so if you if you
make it a crime to not do your job even
if you're a government official it feels
like the wrong move like that's going to
come back and bite your ass later uh it
seems like the right move for not doing
your job should be impeachment and you
know getting fired and all the usual
remove from job kind of
things so but it's good persuasion it it
puts you in the frame of understanding
that what they're doing is is criminal
in its um impact it's not technically
illegal to not do your job but is
Criminal like in its impact has a
criminal
outcome so yes good persuasion not
totally
uh technically
correct all right let me finish this off
by reading a summary by Uncommon Sense
on that's a account on the
xplatform and it's it says tyranny is
here and I'll just read it the way it's
written uh they want to charge Tucker
Carlson with Espionage for journalism
now the they is the Democrats so they
want to charge tuer Carlson with
Espionage for journalism then they
already charged the January 6 protesters
for protesting they charged Trump for
being a good president and not going
along with their plan they rigged the
Democrat primary for Biden they're
charging RFK Jr for financing issues in
quotes all the bidens have been
implicated in well-documented crimes and
not charged that's not true um Hunters
being charged for the gun stuff they
want to remove the most popular
candidate from the ballot and tell you
why he's a threat to
democracy tyranny is not in the future
it is here the emperor has no close all
we have to do is acknowledge it see
that's that's one of those Emperor has
no Clos things
that gets a little overused but in this
specific case I allow
it
now uh this tyy thing sneaks up on you
doesn't it because I don't wake up in
the morning say oh I'm in tyranny but
when you see the full list it doesn't do
look like any kind of Republic does
it did I retweet it um I don't remember
I may
have yeah so we do look like a country
which has lost its um core principles we
look like a country that who our systems
have uh been destroyed and were
resulting to
tribalism you know insults and tribalism
because the system is destroyed and why
is the system
destroyed I think it's
wokeness and
Dei I think that they have destroyed the
American system so that we don't have
the option of using the system we only
have the option of arguing like uh My
Tribe has to kill everybody in your
tribe so wokeness did in fact and uh I
think it was Tim P was pointing out that
it goes all the way back to game
gamergate days and if you trace the the
wokeness all the way through what it's
become you know de and CRT and
everything else that it is
indeed it's really clear to see that as
the uh complete Pro progression of
tyranny
so there you there you are there's a
whole summary of everything
and I believe that's all I needed to
tell you today so I'm going to say
goodbye to the uh folks on X who are
watching in the rumble platform and on
YouTube thanks for joining I'll be here
tomorrow same time by the way if you
watch it if you watch this show on the
big screen
TV with a blanket over your legs and a
cat laying on the blanket on your legs
it is actually the best way to watch the
show so do that next time see you next
see you tomorrow
all
