oh let me check my notes oh I can't
because my new book is in the way that
you should order
now in time for Christmas still time
this book will change your
life this book is the second edition
changed lots of people's lives already
and it's only getting bigger better so
get those now you still have time if
you'd like to uh take your experience up
the levels that you can't even imagine
can't even imagine all you need is a
cuper mug or glass a tanker gels or a
canteen juger flask of vegetable of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine H the
day the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go oh yeah
oh yeah that's good savor
it so who's feeling ungovernable
today I am a little bit ungovernable I
always feel that
way well let's talk about all of the
news of course we'll talk about Trump
and Colorado and K's word salad and all
kinds of bad stuff but we're going to
have fun with it all because I don't
feel too s serious today and I don't
feel like there's too much risk today
actually but uh first of all we've got
talking to the animals uh there's some
scientists who figured out how to talk
to a whale sort of uh Dr Brenda macowan
UC Davis lauded the Breakthrough so they
recorded some whales and then they
played some whale talk and it attracted
a whale and whenever they played the
whale talk the whale
responded now they don't know exactly
what the whale is saying but if you've
seen any of those viral videos of the
Husky dogs using little buttons you put
on the ground so they can say words they
like food take me out and then they get
more and more buttons and then the
buttons form like a language and then
you see the videos of the dog saying
things like I don't like my life give me
some treats let's go to the store and
you think can that dog always do that
or was that just like the weird got
lucky and that's why it's a viral
video well I see a
world in which animals not only can
speak to us through AI translating their
thoughts but here's the fun
part I feel like the part of the animal
that's missing is the you know the
language
function I assume animals don't have a
language function but what happens if AI
becomes the language function would they
actually learn
language you know their own version not
English but would they learn their own
version of more words and start putting
thoughts to certain
words at which point that at least
internally they would have a language
now if they have a language does that
make them
smarter because I have a theory that the
reason the large language model AI works
is because the combination of words is
basically what we think is intelligence
just word combinations so if you could
get the equivalent of word combinations
into an animal a whale or a
dog would the would the animals start
acting like they're
smarter just because the words give them
a little extra
intellectual framework or something I
think maybe
I don't know the answer the question but
I think maybe if you see those husky
dogs they they look like they actually
got smarter not that they just learn to
use these buttons it looks like they're
actually gaining language skills so
Planet of the Apes I
know Brian relli is taking a Victory lap
for his prediction a while ago that uh
soon all the music would be AI so
Microsoft is integrating this Music
Creation app that just makes up AI music
any kind you want into its co-pilot AI
so now all the music the lyrics the
instruments and it's all going to be
done by AI Brian tells us so you could
have infinite songs just by telling it
sort of what the topic is so you could
say songs about the
economy and
then the economy and then you listen to
the
song now I listen to the first example
of it no interest
whatsoever so this will be a good test
so Brian relli who's whose predictions
on technology you should really pay
attention to because he's way ahead of
the curve but just for fun I'm going to
be the opposing uh prediction the
opposing prediction is that AI generated
art of any kind be it movie or music or
visual art will have a very limited and
Niche appeal and it will never get out
of it and it's because I believe that
what we're uh responding to with art is
the understanding that a human made it
and that's the only activating part soon
as soon as you know a computer made it
no interest at all just noise so that's
my prediction it's the opposite of
Brian's let's see just to make it fun
all right uh I saw a crazy crazy idea
Jordan Peterson was tweeting this or
posting it uh there's some researchers
who took the concept of Mo's law you
know that one that says your microchip
power will double every whatever years
and sure enough for many years in a row
Moore's Law his prediction that you know
the doubling would happen at a very
predictable
rate pretty much right on point
so somebody said Hey what if we took
that concept about uh life on the planet
CU life on the planet keeps getting more
complicated just like a m microchip so
somebody said what if we took the
complexity of Life as we know it and
then we did a reverse Moors law to find
out when life must have started because
if you can find a predictable law with h
human complexity that somehow mimics
Mo's law as sort of an analogy or a
model you might be able to figure out
when life started and so they worked
that
calculation and they decided that it
started like way before we think you
did how far
before well uh maybe uh life maybe
before
Earth so that so using this method they
find out that life began before Earth
was a
planet which would
suggest that life started in a simpler
form somewhere else and had a few
billion years to become complicated
enough that by the time we got our first
taste of it it was already complex a
little
bit I don't know maybe
maybe um I wouldn't say that the Moors
law analogy
is any kind of science so I wouldn't
call this science it's just sort of
interesting interesting mental
experience let's call it New York Post
says that more people are leaving New
York they're fleeing New York and Texas
is the one that's had the biggest
population gain I don't know if that's
biggest population gain by numbers or by
percentage probably just
numbers uh but that would be actually in
this case numbers is the better better
than a percentage so that's
valid now why do you think people are
fleeing New York in going to
Texas
taxes Freedom less
craziness better public
relations well one thing Texas is doing
better than New York is doing way better
on public relations you know if if you
looked at uh Texas as a product with
marketing Texas is marketing my God
Florida and
Texas they've done a really good job of
just sort of marketing their product uh
to a certain kind of buyer and the
buyers are responding so no surprise
doing a good job um but imagine being
New
York and you're biggest problem at the
moment is
immigration and people think that Texas
is handling is so much better that
they're moving closer to the
Border that's right their biggest
problem in New York is probably
immigration New York City anyway and to
get away from the immigration they're
going to move closer to the
Border that's a pretty good endorsement
for Texas if moving closer to the Border
makes you feel safer but of course
immigration would be one of many
variables I think taxes are probably
closer to the top of the list when I
think about moving I primarily think
about taxes is it let me test that on
you if anybody's not in one of those
state tax low state tax states when you
consider moving because probably
everybody noodles about it do you think
taxes mostly or is it some kind of
Freedom
thing mostly taxes yeah yeah so the New
York City taxes are just crazy because
you got the city taxes on top of the
state taxes yeah I right now if I if I
move to Texas let me just give you an
idea how bad this is so I live in
California if I were to moveed to Texas
and just kept doing my same job because
it's I'm independent of
location I would save enough on state
taxes in uh in Texas to buy a
substantial
Mansion for free for free the amount I
would save on taxes would more than pay
for a mansion
a multi-million dollar mansion it'd be
free how do you not move for a free
Mansion right I'm doing okay and you
know I don't want to move out of my
house and I like the weather and
everything so honestly it's mostly the
weather I live in one of the few places
that you could live year round and be
okay with
it by by late February I'm going to be a
little complainy because it's been too
cold and rainy for too long but I I'm in
the middle of the December rainy season
and when I heard it was going to be
raining all day today my first first
impression was yay rainy day because we
don't get that many it's like a whole
rainy day where you can just hunker down
and get some stuff done and you make
sure you do your indoor exercise and
stuff you I'm still binge watching the
crown on Netflix good R day yeah so you
can't really be California for the
weather if I move to Florida I have to
either move in the summer or never go
Outdoors same with
Texas uh I think Mike cernovich said it
best I would pay a lot of taxes to be
able to live in one state all
year without dying because I went
Outdoors so yeah there's still still an
advantage in California but it's
decreasing all right the National
Archives is going to release all those
Biden emails that are under the Alias so
all of Joe Biden's pseudanonymous
I like saying pseudanonymous
yeah so he used fake names on his emails
to talk with Hunter and I guess anybody
else he didn't want to be identified
with so now 1,800 emails will be
released to James comr and the house
oversight committee is there any chance
at all that we're not going to learn
something really really embarrassing
about Joe Biden from 1,800 emails that
he thought were sensitive enough that he
didn't want his real name on
them how in the world does that
not end up with some juicy stuff I mean
it might not be Change the World stuff
but it's going to be juicy it's
definitely going to be tantalizing so
look for
that you would be surprised to know the
KL Harris said in public uh something
that didn't make
sense
she actually said this quote you know
every election cycle we talk about this
is the most election of our
lifetime and then Lawrence o Don said
this one is this one
is oh no then she said Lawrence this one
is yes this one is the most election of
our in fact of all the other elections
this is the
most yeah very very much the most and uh
with any luck our next election will be
even more of the most of this whatever
there is that's now more of it but
there's a lot more of it whatever it is
the election or
something all right so get that
straight um and she says uh quote we are
literally talking about people who are
attempting to divide our country in the
most crude frankly and profound
way never say this in the most crude
frankly and profound
way she really needs to be sent back to
talking School we're going to send you
back to the school to learn how to put
words together and a thing we call
sentences because you're not too good at
it uh we are talking about those who are
intent and
purposeful what we are talking about
those who are intent and purposeful to
to attack fundamental
freedoms what the hell is she babbling
about Lawrence
O'Donald um and then she she continues
the freedom to be free the freedom to be
free could we ever have the freedom to
be free uh the freedom to be free from
Fear actually that's rest of the
sentence the freedom to be free from
fear of violence and hate the freedom to
just be the freedom to just
be I like adding the Kamala Harris uh
accents like you know where she punches
some words and she'll pick the most
ridiculous words to to emphasize so I'd
like to do that
again the
freedom to be free from fear of violence
and hate the freedom just
be the freedom to just
be the freedom to just be
now was somebody threatening your
freedom to just
be I don't recall your freedom to just
be to be threatened at
all now does that mean you could be any
way you want to be can you murder people
and commit crimes because that's how I
want to be I just want to be me
sometimes I want to murder people
sometimes I want to cross the border
illegally I just want to be me and KLA
backs me up 100% if I want to murder
somebody she's in favor of Freedom yeah
no we're not going to talk about the
fact that obviously we're always a mix
of freedom and non-freedom in this
country well John fedman continues to be
uh semi awesome semi not awesome but
semi awesome uh in which he says Tik
Tock is creating warped perceptions of
Israel and Hamas War yes it is so fedman
continues to say things that make
sense not all of it I mean uh let's say
there are policy things that I'm not
going to agree
with but he he correctly identifies
tiktock as a risk which should not be a
political statement and so he doesn't
make it one just fact uh and immigration
is a big problem no matter what your
policies are and he's willing to say
that so I do
like the Federman is not a slave to the
party he's not a puppet he's definitely
not a puppet to the party now that's I'm
not endorsing him for president or
anything crazy but um I just love it
when somebody can be
honest it's kind of unexpected so credit
him also credit to Thomas Massie and one
of the things he did was vote for this
uh this idea he voted for a debt limit
uh
deal the the last time the last time we
went through this he voted for a debt
limit deal in exchange for caps and a 1%
cut uh in the event that they have to do
a long uh continuing resolution now it's
all
technical you know Congress but
what he's basically saying is that
because they couldn't agree on a budget
that would you know cut certain things
and increase certain things and you can
never agree on that if it's Republicans
and Democrats but they because it was an
emergency you know you had to do
something uh they managed to get through
uh some kind of a cap with a automatic
1%
cut which is exactly
right right so if you think this is the
bad default oh no we couldn't make good
decisions and now we have to default to
1% cut across the board that is the
right
decision if it were up to me I would
said you know nobody knows what works
why don't you just cut everything 1% and
then do it again next year until you
have a balanced budget if you just cut
1% a year for what 10 years wouldn't you
be way back into the we can make this
work
category I think you would so that's a
Massy win I would say as well as anybody
who voted on the same side with he did
um but having worked in the corporate
world as a budget guy it was my job to
pull together all the budgets from the
different groups and one thing I learned
that I'll never
forget is you can look at all their
details of you should increase my budget
and everybody wants an increase budget
because they like more power and then
the big boss just says yeah all that's a
bunch of just cut Everybody by
10% and then it was my job to tell
everybody who had done all this work to
know exactly how much they need next
year say yeah that's not going to happen
just cut it 10% but I can't it's
impossible I could never cut a 10% yeah
but you're going to cuz you get fired if
you don't it's impossible I could never
do it there is no way I could possibly
do it and then you check again at the
end of the year under budget yeah at the
end of the year under budget now you say
to yourself but Scott what about all the
things that came up during the year
where they did legitimately need extra
money what happens then you know what
happens then the big boss says yeah I
guess in this case you do need
legitimately more money so I'm going to
take it out of this group and give it to
you and that other group will just have
to figure it out and then they
did then they did
yeah there there's nothing that a
manager can do more easily than cut the
budget because people will figure it out
they'll make do with less they'll just
figure it
out all right uh as you know Colorado
their higher Court said that Trump's a
big old insurrectionist and therefore
cannot even be on the ballot for the for
the uh primaries it's for the primary
right give me a fact check of this are
we only talking about the primary he
can't be on the ballot right
now you know that that's not going to
make any difference no
difference here's why first of all
nobody in the world thinks that the
Supreme Court will withhold it am I
right nobody thinks the Supreme Court is
going to approve this so it'll be
reversed but apparently uh the
Republican Party cleverly said we don't
need you for a primary we will just
change our process to what do they call
it uh um what's the other thing not a
primary a
uh caucus a caucus system so the caucus
system I guess the Republicans can just
say well screw you we're still going to
we're still going to pick a candidate
just the way we always did but we're
going to call it a caucus and it'll look
different and we'll just do it that way
so there's no
chance that Trump is you know going to
be frozen out of the system by this
but I'm very much uh liking Jonathan
turley's post on this on the xplatform
in which he
says that this is so bad that in the
unlikely event that this stayed and
Trump was denied the ability to run that
the country would become quote
ungovernable don't you love that
word cuz you and I might have been
tempted to use use like more provocative
words you like oh it's going to be
Boston Tea Party Time or you know it's a
second amendment time or we'd say
something scary sounding like that and
then somebody would say are you talking
about an Insurrection why are you
threatening to violence and then we'd
say well well I like him I I like turly
saying the country would become
ungovernable because I love what that
includes that includes everything
like nothing is ruled out by
ungovernable but importantly it includes
totally legal processes right so I much
prefer saying that we will become or
even are
ungovernable in fact it feels like a
compliment doesn't it don't you feel
that if somebody calls you ungovernable
isn't your first sense of
that I kind of
am oh was it RFK Jr said it
oh I'm being corrected RFK Jr said we
would become ungovernable oh you're
right you're right yeah that was RFK
Jr um yeah I I I read poost of that
you're
right thank you for that
correction but it's a great word
ungovernable it stays away from the
violence but it does capture all that
all right everybody I think everybody
who observes this thinks Trump's poll
numbers will go up would you agree
Trump's poll numbers will go up probably
because of this
um but here's what I like about it the
best I really love my
overreaches when the Democrats have a
good
argument then I think to myself oh they
got a good argument there but when they
overreach and they do things just so
crazy I kind of like that because it's a
signal that something's going to uh
something something good is going to
happen so what I like about this
overreach is it uh gives all of us
permission to assume that the 2020
election was rigged even if there's no
proof
whatsoever because this overreach is so
egregious so obvious so in your face and
it's it's really obviously driven by the
stop Trump at any cost
mentality right because I don't think
there's any legal Observer who thinks
it's going to
hold it looks like TDS and it looks like
stop Trump at any you know there's
nothing you would stop at to do it if
that if that's the case
today what would make you think it
wasn't the case in
2020 because I think they were more
afraid of them in 2020 than they are
even now I mean or at least it's a tie
so I think that they've now showed their
hand so uh people who are you know
legitimately known to be part of the
Democrat Party have now quite publicly
shown us that they will stop at
nothing so you think 2020 was a fair
election when you know that the the
party as a mentality has enough of a
common mentality that will stop at
nothing because they think he's
Hiller we also know thanks to uh Mike
Ben's
reporting that there was this thing
called the election Integrity
partnership uh that was sensoring
millions of prot trump tweets ahead of
2020 and that a team of high level DC
operatives were plotting a color
Revolution if Trump
won fair and
square that the Democrats some notable
ones and and it's in writing the actual
documents in which they were planning
some kind of a
coup if he won the
election now based on what um I can see
from the
outside it kind of looks like the uh
Democrats believe their own
propaganda because the the documents
that exist don't give don't give a hint
that is purely political I mean the
outcome is purely political but they're
thinking
as it seems to be you know maybe
suggested by their writings is that they
actually thought it was a risk to the
world I think I think many of them had
actually convinced themselves that their
own propaganda was real and that Trump
was
literally a potential
Hiller I think they actually believed
that I don't know what's worse that they
didn't believe it and tried to get away
with it or that they actually believed
what they were saying
but apparently the mental illness part
of this is way bigger than I thought
because I always assumed it was
pretending to be mad you know so that
their team could win but I think they
actually believed what they were
saying and that's kind of a mind Bender
to me all
right so
uh it's the first time that that
amendment has been used I think Glenn
Greenwald pointed out that uh even Jack
Smith
who is the federal prosecutor going
after Trump even he's not charging Trump
with
Insurrection but this little state has
decided that it was Insurrection even
though the guy who has the most
information and the most mission to
charge him for Insurrection is not
charging Trump with
Insurrection so the people who know the
most about it and have the most
incentive to charge him with it the
federal it's there's not even enough to
take a run at it now keep in mind that
they're not that Jack Smith's not doing
Insurrection in the in the context of
all the legal system making the most
absurd claims about Trump like all of
the all of the legal claims are just
such a stretch but they couldn't even
stretch in the context of everything
stretched like all of their legal
arguments being a little bit
ridiculous they couldn't stretch that
one
enough and still Colorado said oh yeah
Insurrection pretty
obvious yeah so this is exactly what it
looks like one team trying to game the
system break the system abuse the system
until they get their way so yeah you you
can absolutely hold your head up high if
with no proof whatsoever you claim 2020
was probably obvious obviously rigged
with no evidence that's that's now
allowed because so many things are so
obviously corrupt and their thinking was
so obviously along those lines it would
be ridiculous to assume that they didn't
didn't act and by the way there does
seem to be a lot of stuff missing in
Georgia now I'm a little lost in the
details of the story but follow the the
rasmuson account because they're they're
on all of the details but apparently
things have been asked for in Georgia
that are just missing that would be the
only way you could know if the election
was fair so there's no way that the
Georgia election was fair if they can't
produce the basic audit materials you
should assume it's unfair I don't have
any evidence of that or proof let's say
I don't have any proof of it but your
working assumption when the audit
materials disappear they disappeared I
don't know where they they are can't
find those machines can't find those
ballots can't open the door and let you
look yeah just assume it's rigged you
have every right as a citizen to say oh
that's good enough that is enough that
is enough
evidence to operate on a working
assumption that 2020 was rigged with no
proof no proof at all I don't have
any but they're try pretty hard to make
sure you don't get any that's good
enough for me
V
ramaswami said of the Colorado decision
that he would withdraw from the Colorado
GOP Primary unless uh Trump is allowed
back in he I think Chris Christie railed
against it I think uh Nikki Hy raed
against it um I haven't heard from
DeSantis yet but I assume he's not going
to be happy about it I'm actually quite
quite pleased quite pleased that the
Republicans seem to have joined forces
in saying I'm running against Trump but
you can't do this you just can't do this
so good work good work Republicans all
the way to Chris Christie Chris Christie
is running primarily to take Trump out
of the race And even Chris Christie says
nope nope no that's too far hashtag too
far all right um
Turley this is what Turley said I
confused uh RFK Jr who said ungovernable
but Turley had a good uh post as well as
he always does uh he said it's a hands
hands down the most anti-democratic
opinion I've seen in my
lifetime and it's a slippery slope
because it sort of does allow the
Republicans to do the same thing and by
the same thing I mean a Republican state
could say hey you guys are
insurrectionists and then people they
would say what are you talking about
what did we do that was insurrectionists
and then the Republicans in some other
state can say well just look at uh the
Colorado decision that was just a coup
because their decision was so un unmowed
from any kind of legal precedent or
argument that that's a
Insurrection and then they say what that
that was our court system we're just
using the court system and then the red
state says yeah you know it's not up to
you it's not up to you yeah we hear you
when you say that wasn't an Insurrection
not up to you we say it was so we're
going to let your not going to let your
candidate on and then they say but but
you're calling something an Insurrection
that wasn't really an Insurrection and
then the Republican state say
you that's it yeah so there's no way
this can stand the the Supreme Court is
not going to let it stand right would
you agree if if the Supreme Court let
this stand and let's say the Republicans
didn't immediately turn it into a caucus
if it actually ended up making a
difference I'm going to be pretty
ungovernable you don't know what
ungovernable looks like and and I think
that it's it's very important for both
sides to read the mood of the other
side if Republicans were doing something
to Democrats that was driving them to
violence I'd sure want to know about it
and I'm pretty sure I would try to you
know modify a little bit hey hey hey you
gone too far they're they're actually
loading their guns too far let's see if
we can you know take this down a notch
right if they take Trump off the ballot
with lawfare
or ridiculous Court decisions we're
going to be pretty
ungovernable now I don't call for
violence I never call for violence but
you don't know what ungovernable looks
like until Republicans do it you do not
want to be in a country where
Republicans have decided to be
ungovernable you don't want to be
there so let let me just make sure that
everybody knows you know where the line
is Oh there's a line line there's a
line keeping Trump off the ballot for
 that's a line that's a line
yeah and I I I re remind you that I'm
backing VI ramaswami for president but
you don't do that in America you don't
you don't take the guy who's leading in
the polls off off the ballot you just
don't do
that uh Senator Tom Tillis Republican is
going to introduce a bill borrowing
federal funds for election uh people who
misuse the 14th Amendment so Colorado
allegedly was misusing that 14th
Amendment the Insurrection part um so
the federal government May if this got
passed um get their funding cut but I
don't think this will get passed and I
don't think the ruling will stand it's
more like something to talk
about um
the amuse account on
X great account to follow just amuse
look for that um says flashback 10
Democrat controlled States this is back
in Lincoln's day uh uh put refused to
put Lincoln on their ballots uh despite
that Lincoln won anyway so I guess these
were states that were lesser populated
but a lot of them Alabama Arizona
Florida Georgia uh Louisiana Michigan
North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee
and
Texas all of those states refus to put
Lincoln on the
ballot yeah this Trump trump equals
Lincoln thing is very bothersome isn't
it for the obvious
reason let me just say that Trump needs
this comparison like he needs a hole in
the
head stop it stop it
all right well I think this is a good
point because we forget it it's very
easy to think that the politics has
reached its worst level not even
close not even close the worst level was
in our past like way worse yeah maybe
you could argue Oh I thought it was
better in the 80s or something I don't
know maybe it was but in the in the
further past it was way worse
I think even the fake news was way worse
in the past you know when when a few you
know rich people controlled all the
newspapers like Hurst I got a feeling
that was worse we just didn't know it
because because we didn't know what fake
news was in those days all
right
um so yeah as Mike Ben was talking about
we have documents showing that part of
our government wanted to uh do some kind
of a color Revolution or even
potentially a
military uh Insurrection if Trump won
faen
square that was actually being talked
about so yes everything they accuse you
of is what they're
doing uh Molly heing way asked this
question have any Democrats spoken
against their party's
authoritarianism meaning the Colorado
decision uh absolutely terrifying Soviet
style campaign strategy their employing
of destroying democracy and trying to
imprison their political
opponents have you seen any Democrat
speak out against
this I'm kind of waiting for
fedman has fedman said anything see now
this this will be a good test because if
Federman is who I think he is which is
somebody I might disagree with on some
topics but with somebody who actually
thinks it through and is not going to
just take the team play if he doesn't
come out against
this then him like his his value is
zero because this one's
easy so far feder's been pretty good on
the topics that we never should have
politic politicized in the first place
right Tik Tok is not a political
question it shouldn't be so he gets the
right decision the border security
shouldn't be a political decision it
became that way but it shouldn't be
so he gets to decide that one based on
what just what makes sense but likewise
this Colorado thing even though the
context is
politics your opinion on it should not
be based on politics it should be based
on do you want to live in a stable
country or do you want to do like
this so Federman we call upon you to see
if you can at least be
consistent in saying that if there's a
topic that should be above or outside of
politics that you will judge that in
individually if you can do that I'm
going to I'm going to I'm going to keep
my respect for Federman even when I you
might violently disagree on some
policies but what I think is that uh
people can't tell the difference between
demons and
angels and I think that the Democrats
believe they are the Angels and they're
fighting against the demons and they
think the demons are Trump and the magga
people because they've been told that
but I think the big problem here is that
people don't know the difference between
a demon and and an angel we can't even
tell the difference between UFOs and
Angels because some people think they're
Angels right so I think that's what it
is they they think they're Angels
fighting demons but they're actually
demons fighting Angels or everyone
thinks they're the angel and everybody
else is the demon which I think would be
a a more fair way to describe
it uh Mike cage points out that
California voted end illegal immigration
handouts with prop prop
187 but judges overruled it so the
people wanted to stop giving the
immigrants so many handouts but the
judge said nope and same with gay
marriage Mike points out Proposition 8
uh public voted for it judges said no I
don't remember that but I'll take his
word for it um and so Mike says we
haven't we haven't been anything close
to a democracy or a republic for decades
we live under judicial
Supremacy I hadn't really heard that uh
phrase before judicial
Supremacy but of course the the judges
get picked by the political system so
it's all it's all you know corruption as
it as it is expressed through out the
system but let me ask you
this pick any time in American history
you know just see the timeline in your
in your mind put on the blindfold and
throw a dart and it hits any time in the
past you really think the courts were
better in the
past
really you don't think the courts were
just like wildly putting black people in
jail for being black you you don't think
the courts were just as you know corrupt
and bribed and uh you know crony
capitalism and all that of course they
were yeah I don't know that it's worse
but Mike's Mike's Point is fair the the
judge the you know the courts have had
this unnatural control and maybe even
more than
ever but I do think the Colorado thing
will not stand well Nikki
heli uh is in the news of course some
say she's drawing even with
disantis for one of the primaries
doesn't matter cuz it's boring she's not
going to win so it doesn't matter
um but according to the hill Nikki hilly
is facing a barrage of sexist
attacks Nikki hilly is getting a barrage
of sexist
attacks have you seen
any I haven't seen any sexist
attacks where are they coming from
I I I'll tell you what I've
seen I've seen a whole bunch of people
say you know what I like the fact that
she's
female in fact I would argue that her
entire appeal is based on being
female because I don't mind that if you
are a woman and you think you're
underrepresented and you say you know
maybe not my first choice but she is a
woman I'd like to give some
representation that's closer to to me
I'm okay with that I mean that's that's
a
reasonable reasonable uh take in a
democracy but I feel like that's her big
Advantage you know it's like her biggest
advantage in and she thinks so too
because she said in public during a
debate that if you want a job done right
call a
woman if you want somebody to talk about
it call a man if you want a job done
right call a woman
woman that's what she said now if you
say something that's so
overtly uh bigoted and sexist against
one gender you know what you should
expect if you're an overt public
misandrist sexist as she is Hillary
Clinton was as well um because Hillary
Clinton also said that being a woman was
an advantage you can't run for president
and tell us your gender is an
advantage nope if Trump did it he should
be disqualified too if Trump ever said
you know what you need a man as
president I would instantly say nope
nope sorry you cannot you cannot be the
president and say that there's a gender
or a sexual preference or a ethnicity or
religion that's the bad one you can't
there aren't that many things that are
that dis disqualifying but that's number
one that's number one that's the most
disqualifying oh I'm going to be your
president but I think some of you are
 no no no no no no no no no
disqualifying that that that was the
moment that turned me against Hillary
Clinton hard when she said women are
just better as presidents because they
listen better she
said so Hillary says uh women listen
better and Nikki Hy says uh that uh
women will do the job right call a woman
now if you say stuff like that you
should expect to be called a lot of
things and many of those things will
rhyme with
bunt many of them
will all right Trump uh let's do an
update on the Trump is Hitler persuasion
game as you know the Democrats are
selling their Trump uh is
Hitler uh but uh do you think that
that's a good
play there's one thing that the
Democrats did not count on when deciding
that their big play was going to be
Trump is
Hitler and it's you're going to laugh
when I say
it and you should have seen it coming
because of the Hamas
situation have you noticed the young
people don't seem to think that Hitler
was much of a big
deal have you noticed that that young
people kind of don't know who Hitler was
and what he was up to if you ask young
people how many people died in World War
II they might guess something like I
don't know 10
20,000 yeah
so just hold in mind that the primary
campaign the primary the biggest thing
the Democrat R are claiming about Trump
is that he's like
Hitler also at the same time the
Democrats are trying to be the party of
young people you make sure they get
those young people because Biden could
not have won without the under 30 vote
am I right that's a guarantee if Biden
had not just crushed the young people
vote he had no
chance so now their approach is to tell
the young people that Trump is like
Hitler how's that working well here's an
update um turns out that uh young
people uh have moved to
Trump so in 2020 uh Biden got he beat
Trump by 24 points among people under 30
do you know how hard it is to win by
24 you know 24 percentage basis points
it's really hard so
so uh Biden didn't just beat Trump in
the under 30s he just annihilated
him what's it look like
today uh NBC news says
uh uh similar pattern
of what is it 46% to
42% so there's been a big shift anyway
so the numbers are messed up here on on
what I wrote down but there's been a big
shift toward
Trump now just just hold that in your
mind so the entire approach of the
Democrats is completely useless for the
under 30s because it just doesn't mean
that much you you know imagine here's a
mental experiment imagine you're not the
age you are with the education you have
and you just didn't know who Hitler was
it was like somebody says you know on
the plan
glark there was a terrible leader his
name was
H so what you don't want is you don't
want Trump to be like the evil
leader from the planet
guac and the people under 30 say Okay
Grandpa okay it just doesn't hit it it
doesn't hit if you don't if you can't
feel Hiller in your bones as everybody
my age can
right Hitler is something you feel
Hitler isn't just like a historical
reference you feel
Hitler but not if you're under
30 if you're under 30 it's just a name
it's just something people keep
mentioning they don't feel
it and you can't really feel it unless
you've done what people like me have
done how many of you sat in your living
room when you were young and usually
your father had the history channel on
and it was non-stop Hitler
footage how many of you had that
experience yeah a lot of
yeses yeah I'd be sitting in the living
room at home and itd be like Hitler
Hitler Hitler and here's a video of
Hitler here's some World War II and look
at all these dead people Hitler Hitler
here's a that here's a picture of the
death camp here's all the starving
people in the death camp I be like ah ah
I mean I had such childhood
PTSD from All Things World War II I mean
seriously I had PTSD I was damaged and I
didn't live through the war at all you
know I was born after the war of course
uh but I totally got PTSD because it was
just rammed down my throat from birth
but you're under 30 it's just a story in
a book just a story in the
book all right
so there's an update on Epstein
apparently there's a bunch of people
will be named from some recent or not
recent but a court case about Epstein
they're going to unseal the names of the
people involved but I agree with
stenhammer who post it it's going to be
a nothing Burger all right this this is
not Epstein's list of clients it's not
that there was a court case it's over
that the names of the people involved
were sealed they're going to be
unsealed
people who are involved with one case
you might get some surprises you might
get some news stories but probably it's
going to be a big nothing that's what I
think
too all right
um um Colombia the country we learned
from also the amuse account uh is
allowing Visa free travel from Iran
Yemen and 41 countries including African
nations
so all you have to do is get to colia
colia won't even check your documents
apparently you just walk into Columbia
and from there you go through the you
travel up through the uh Southern border
of the United
States so we are now have an unlimited
open door to all of
Iran uh all of their
terrorists now is there any chance that
Iran has not sent their terrorists to
set up camp in America
there's no real chance of that because
it's the most obvious thing you do I
wrote a book called the religion war was
the uh sequel to God's debris number of
years ago and uh although it was like 20
years ago or whatever uh I speculated
that the uh Middle East
terrorists would put agents in all the
major cities in America and activate
them at the same time because one
terrorist in one
city can do a hell of a lot of damage
just one you know fires and drones and
fent and all and you know you could you
could do the math it doesn't take much
to shut down a city so I feel like
that's the big risk in the future is the
people who snuck in and are just sort of
waiting for the order that's the thing I
I fear that a lot more than nuclear
war
anyway
um so we'll see how that works
out it's really unbelievable that our
border is open you it it went from well
this is weird and unproductive and
suboptimal to are you kidding me
are you kidding me the border is still
wide open in the sense that all you have
to do is say you have one Asylum and you
can come right in my god well I think
there's a guarantee of a Republican
president
primarily because of
that um we learned that President XI
told uh Biden when he was here that uh
she stance as he wants a peaceful
reunification of Taiwan and he rejected
the idea that he's going to do something
militarily you know in the next few
years does that sound
true do you believe
it that he's not going to do something
militarily and that he wants a peaceful
reunification it doesn't have a specific
timeline that's at least within 2
years I actually believe it I 100%
believe it and always have do you know
why China is the most predictable
country in the
world there's no more predictable
country than China I think they told you
exactly what makes sense for China and
then they're going to do it do you know
why because that makes makes the most
sense for China do you think China
thinks that a war with Taiwan could go
well they're not going to end up with
any microchips they're going to end up
with a smoldering Island and a degraded
economy that won't won't be able to do
trade with the rest of the world there
isn't the slightest chance that the
current government of uh China which
looks like it's pretty stable wants a
war about Taiwan not any they don't have
any there's no urg
need their um as Kyle bass points out
their real estate segment is in freefall
and their banking system might be in
free
fall China is in a lot of trouble
literally the last thing they need is a
war especially an optional War there's
no way China starts an optional
War for a bunch of assets that will
clearly be destroyed during the the war
right if it looked like China was going
to take control of
Taiwan I hate to tell you Taiwan but all
your microchip businesses are going to
get bombed by
us am I
wrong we would never let China take
control of the actual factories because
it's so hard apparently it's really hard
to make a factory that makes microchips
we're not going to let them get
that the there's not the slightest
chance so microchips will become like
you know
unusable right so given that 100% of the
arguments suggests that they should wait
as long as they want see here's the
thing that China has going for them they
already say it's part of China and they
got the United States to say the same
thing even though we act like it's not
we say it so it's sort of not a problem
they need to solve and I will I agree
with she
that a peaceful reunification with
Taiwan is basically
inevitable I don't know about the
peaceful part but but the reunification
is inevitable because geography I just I
just don't see any in 200 years you
think Taiwan and China are going to be
separate countries in 200
years I doubt it you know maybe add
another 100 years but basically uh
basically I think they end up unified
one way or another
um
Yemen is being such a pain in the ass
around the Red Sea they keep uh sending
rockets and things that uh bunch of
ships are now re-rooting they have to go
the long
way uh and the energy prices are going
up but not that much so it turns out
that a current hot threat in the Red Sea
did not Spike energy prices nearly as
much as you think you know under
2% that's strange now what are we going
to do about
that given that Iran is backing the
people who are sending the missiles from
Yemen we don't want a third
war but don't you think Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia should just take over
Yemen what do you
think I don't think we should go in and
I don't think they need any military
help but I feel like Saudi Arabia has
the power and and Yemen is looking to
ruin Commerce in the entire Middle East
if you're going to ruin Commerce in the
entire Middle
East you get
conquered yeah I mean I think Saudi
Arabia has an
argument let's talk about France uh
parament Parliament approved an
immigration bill that boosts uh the
ability to Deport foreigners and it
limits access to some of their their
benefits so is that a turning point is
France starting to you know write the
ship I feel like France is lost I don't
think France is going to recover from
their immigration what do you think I'm
not there so it's hard to tell but just
based on what we see it doesn't look
like they can recover I I think France
will just turn
Islamic we'll
see uh over in Poland they got a new uh
prime
minister and
uh prime minister's uh name last name is
uh wait a minute is this true he's named
Donald
Tusk can you do give me a fact check on
that the new prime minister of Poland
his first name is Donald
his last name is
Tusk what do you get if you combine musk
with Trump or Trump with
musk it's Tusk isn't
it it it looks like it's just a
combination of Elon Musk and Donald
Trump Donald
Tusk what the
hell what how is that possible how do we
live in world where this can
happen it it honestly it feels like we
are part of a
simulation and we're part of a game and
whatever whatever life force you know
caused the simulation wants us to know
but wants to do it in a funny way like
it's dropping every hint in the world
that we're a simulation and none of is
real it's like how many hints do I have
to give you do you need another hint how
about we'll name the prime minister of
Poland Donald Tusk anything anything
you're still not getting this that's
what it feels
like well anyway this new Prime Minister
in Poland immediately went and shut down
a news station because
uh they didn't like the propaganda
coming out of
it to which I say the following
uhoh yeah we thought Poland was one the
good guys right but
they turned off a uh a source of free
speech because they didn't like the
speech said it wasn't
true now here's my problem I feel like
our brains are stuck in the
past and here's what I mean by that uh
if I asked you do you believe in free
free speech I believe every one of you
would say yeah yes Free Speech yes now
free speech became a
concept you know with the the
Constitution right hundreds of years ago
and hundreds of years ago what did Free
Speech look
like well it was individuals who didn't
have much reach you know they they
couldn't be influencers like on social
media so people like me would just be
complaining to my neighbors all the free
speech I want and if I wanted to I could
get a little box and go to the town
square and I could get maybe a dozen
people to listen to me free speech Yes
free
speech is only
legal because at one time it wasn't
dangerous at least dangerous the way it
is now but now it's really dangerous now
you can say stuff that people will
believe not only because the bad people
have reach they can get to everybody but
also the bad people have technique that
they never had before they have actual
hypnosis
brainwashing
propaganda skill that didn't exist 200
years ago
so here's a thought experiment for
you if the founders of this country were
designing the Constitution under our
current situation where Free Speech can
destroy a country pretty
easily would it be free
I think
not I think not yeah yeah believe it or
not I think not because it would be an
existential
risk whe When when speech was made free
initially it wasn't an existential risk
or much of one it would take a lot of
work and I think back then they knew the
newspapers were fake news but they
didn't believe them anyway and it didn't
matter so wasn't big deal but now now
let's say for example that the biggest
uh
polish uh TV
station was running news that they knew
was fake and they were just trying to
control the country or
something do you think you should let
that operate and just let Free Speech
take care of it or is it too big of a
threat it could actually take down the
country I think I think you have to
rethink Free
Speech hate to say it
I think you have to rethink it it
doesn't mean that you get rid of it when
I say rethink it I mean start from
scratch start from a you know just take
away all your assumptions and then see
if you would rebuild it the same way I
don't know if you would don't know if
you
would because uh at the moment an
individual can use free speech to take
down a
country do you think that's possible do
you think a bad actor an
individual say somebody like me do you
think I could take down a
country I
could I hate to tell you but I could
take down a
country some say I'm already doing
it because I did tell you I was going to
take down the Chinese economy back in
2018 and here we are now you could say
but that's not because of you no but it
didn't hurt didn't
hurt so could I save a country yes yes
yeah somebody you know influence is a
formula and I've told you this before
influence is how much skill you have in
communicating influentially how much
skill you have multiplied by your reach
so if you're very skillful but you live
in a cave it doesn't matter if you have
millions of people who watch you like
Taylor Swift but you don't have much to
say it doesn't matter that much
either
but if you have actual skill and
persuasion and you have a huge platform
that would be Trump for example you're
the leader of the you know easily become
the president of the United States and
you have the nuclear
Arsenal so don't forget that formula the
formula is persuasiveness time of reach
the reach never existed
before reach is new but also persuasion
is new we didn't know how to do it 200
years ago the the the technique that I
can employ today is a whole level you
know maybe several levels above what it
was 200 years ago 200 years ago they
would just lie and compare you to
somebody bad that's about it that's all
they
had all right
um so if I were going to rethink free
speech it might be something like
this I'm just going to brainstorm for a
minute you can say anything you want
anywhere you want so that's a good start
right you can say anything you want
anywhere you
want but there would need to be some
kind of
counterforce to make sure that the other
message got matched with it so you could
imagine some kind of situation where you
can say anything you want but there's
some kind of freedom for other people to
put the uh opposing view with it so
let's let's call it a a a matching rule
so the rule is you can say anything you
want anywhere you want Free Speech but
the the alternative fact check has to be
at least technically allowed maybe
nobody wants to use it maybe they don't
disagree with you but it has to be
technically matchable with the opposing
view if it's on social media not in
person right in person you still say
anything you want but if you're going to
be on a digital broadcast
medium then you should have you should
be required to be on a medium that has
something like Community
notes so you can say to yourself yeah
you get all the free speech you want but
the xplatform doesn't have the AB ility
to not have a community notes they got
to do something like that to match the
opposing opinions and if you can't match
the opposing opinion it's too dangerous
to have free
speech what do you
think because the individual would still
have 100% free speech the
platforms that could boost that speech
would have a little extra restriction
but it would be more like add a feature
that everybody wants everybody wants
that feature everybody wants the feature
that shows both sides everybody wants it
so make it
available so I think that you could say
we don't have free speech the way we
used to it's too dangerous now so add a
little add a little uh guard rail but
don't put the guard rail on the person
put the guard rail on the transmission
mediums what do you
think because the X platform would stay
exactly the
same because musk already solved he he
solved for competing opinions cuz that's
kind that's kind of what x does is
basically a competing opinion
Forum so the government should say all
right you're good but let's look at
Facebook that's what I don't want to
see all right but still individuals
would have free speech all right uh
there's a big trend for single parents
and not have having families you're all
aware of that um I'm just going to make
the prediction uh eventually we
will as
humans no longer be masters of the
planet eventually we will apparently
willingly become sort of a a niche
species and robots I think will will
rule the Earth with the exception of
Mars which will be a musk
Colony uh with its prime minister Donald
Tusk
possibly
and uh what's
that all right so yeah I think that uh
we we will either merge with the robots
or temporarily merge with them until we
just decide ah let's just be
robots so suppose you don't want to be a
planet full of
robots but suppose you also agree that
the traditional family
while it's the best of all solutions is
it really practical for maybe at least
half of all
people so what do you do I believe that
you're going to see a a new
system um
evolve and it will be more of a tribal
Community system very much like it takes
a village you know sort of Hillary's
thing and I'm starting
to um organize my life around that
a a tribal model and by that I mean
rather than saying all right I'm going
to have a you know I'm going to marry a
mate and the two of us will be all there
is we we won't let other people in too
much you unless we're both there in a
party or something you know we're not
going to go off and do our own thing
with other people too much and you know
our kids are going to be under our
control and and all that it's great if
you can pull it off but suppose you had
to take all the functions that you need
to be a good person and you just didn't
have the option of having that little
cool family unit where everybody loves
each other and everything's working well
but you need those things I I think what
we're going to do is because there will
be so many people who are
unfamiliar but not in every way so for
example uh I think you're going to see
people who say you know what if you
would be my handyman
sometimes I would cook for you
sometimes and then you'd say hey we
could do this once a week and even if I
haven't done any hand demanding you'll
cook for me once a week we're not
married maybe some friends come over if
you need a something fixed in your house
call me I'd love to do it I'll go over
and spend the afternoon fixing your
thing
now that's just you know one small
example but imagine if you
will um somebody says you know what I'll
add you to my health care because that's
easy for me you know I've Got a Good
Health Care Program so I'll add you
you'll be my dependent and uh maybe I
just like you know giving you some
advice for college and and that's
it just because I want to and I can so
no I'm not
high why are you even asking you're the
third person who ask this morning if I'm
high do I look
high I don't do the show
high have I ever oh
yeah during the pandemic I did but no
not I don't think I've done the show
high a year or
so I have and and by the way you
couldn't tell the
difference the the days that I did it
was stoned down in my mind you couldn't
tell because I I'm a chronic User it's
just not that
different but if you're guessing that
I'm high now nope not even a little
bit insurance companies would love that
you
say all
right um I'm just looking at your
comments uh dangers of weed I think that
the uh people keep telling
me that there are dangers to weed but
you're you're talking to the wrong
person didn't you think I didn't know
that there there's a danger to riding a
bicycle there's a danger to going
Outdoors there's a danger to getting my
car life is a danger
like the whole thing is a danger so if
all you're saying is it's a danger you
haven't told me
anything
but if you say that some people get
medicinal
benefits and they weigh that against the
risk well now you're talking so as long
as we're showing both sides it's fine to
highlight the risks and I do think the
risks for children are are just through
the roof yeah I didn't do it under 18
when I was under 18 I never touched it
I I was just focus on doing what I
needed to
do all
right
uh always more than two
sides another dog not barking what's
that
about if it's your first day of being
ungovernable it's disorienting isn't
it all
right you think I'm getting get married
again here here's where marriage doesn't
make sense to
me I might have five years
left have any of you come to grips with
your own
mortality so yesterday I was thinking oh
you know I want to do a thing or you
know maybe plan for something like
getting a
pet I'm not going to get a
dog that's going to you know that I'm
going to not even going to live as long
as my
dog but all right so I'm 66 and a
half people my age people I know
personally are dropping Dead all over
the place they're dropping dead like
crazy
and sometimes I tell
myself oh I'll make it to you know 85 or
90 but then I think to myself well you
know those years between 75 and
85 I mean I might find some way to like
them but it's not going to be like being
alive now I
mean how long am I going to how long am
I going to work I don't know no idea so
maybe aging won't affect me the same way
as other people but in terms of my my
own
planning I I plan my own mortality five
to 10 years from
now meaning that any decision I
make is I'm only going to be alive for
about 5
years which is really
weird really weird do you know how how
quickly time goes when you're my age
well those of you who are my age you
know exactly like next year is just
going to
disappear so 20% of what I'm counting as
my remaining life is going to be gone in
a blink
because this next year will just
disappear and the and five years will be
gone before I know
it
so I feel weird when I just go to work
because I tell myself wow if I really
knew I only had five years left I'd quit
work and I don't know travel the world
or something but then I think no I like
this I don't want to quit to me the the
most useless thing you could
do is retire and the world I can't think
of anything more
useless maybe you like to
traveling but what good is it so you so
you learn a lot about the world right
before you
die what good is it now if you told me
that traveling extensively in your 20s
was a good idea I'd say yeah because
everything you learn about these other
places you're incorporating into your
whole life it becomes you know part of
your foundation for your entire life
life but if I travel for the next 5
years and then
die it was just a waste of time I
accomplished nothing I left nothing all
I had was some dopamine in a different
town I can get dopamine in my
town right so traveling doesn't make
sense to me so so what I'm expressing is
that when the entire rest of your you
know high quality of life gets so
compressed all your decisions get
squirly because I I'm a super long-term
planner I had a 40-year
plan and I stayed on plan for 40
years I actually had a 40-year plan like
literally and I stayed on plan it
included becoming a famous cartoonist
and then using that Fame to open up
other opportunities and here we are so
I'm right on plan for 40 years so when I
when I realized I might only have like
five left of like good years it's really
disconcerting because I don't know how
to I don't know how to handle that I
don't know how to live in the moment
because I've always lived in the
future all right ladies and
gentlemen download your brain to a robot
well I plan to do that I do plan to be
immortal in the digital domain what what
are the odds that alive in exactly the
era where moving our personality to a
machine is completely
practical what were the odds i' be alive
then and exactly the age where that
really matters see this is why this
can't possibly be
real that this thing I'm experiencing
that I think is my life there's no way
this is
real that exactly the
time I need the robots in the AI I they
just pop
up after 10 million years of human um
Evolution just when I need it there it
is I don't know I'm just not buying it I
just don't buy that any of this is
real all
right you want my guitar amplifier if I
go it is a good amplifier I have to
admit
all right YouTube that's all for now I'm
going to go do some other things thanks
