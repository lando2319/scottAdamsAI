you
[Music]
rub up
morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of humanist
civilization
it's the best thing you've ever seen in
your life and
let me tell you
you've never been happier
so if you'd like to take your experience
up to levels which nobody's ever seen
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of take your chalices die in a canteen
jug of Alaska vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sipping happens
now go
oh yeah that was good yeah that was so
good
it's a good good stuff
well let's talk about all of the things
in the news I like that I'm having
regular segments now
I don't know why it just feels like it's
better
so one of my regular segments is
science which is a little bit sketchy
sketchy science
that's just a working title uh here's
sketchy science there was a study to see
if beer goggles is a real thing
the studies find out if drinking alcohol
makes other people look better
and they decided at the end of their
study that it did not
that people who drink alcohol
it doesn't change their pre impression
of the sexiness of the other person
it's just that they're more likely to
approach the person
now this study was done by let's say
look at the details the study was done
by a whole bunch of people who have
never had a drink of alcohol
now it doesn't actually say that
but you can infer that
by the fact that 100 of people who've
had alcohol know this is wrong
100 of people who have ever tried this
thing called alcohol
they're pretty sure the science is not
exactly right if you know what I mean
so there's that
all right sketchy science that's what
that was
now
um have you ever heard people give their
keys to success
like there's usually five of them I have
my own five
uh which I always forget but they're
they're basically you know go to school
build a talent stack stay off drugs stay
out of
staying in jail I probably forgot one
but that's basically if you get the five
right you're probably going to be good
right was there one more I had and I
forget what it was maybe exercise or
something take care of your body anyway
so uh
uh Dr uberman has some good ones
um and there's some other studies I saw
so here's some other
here's some other keys to success right
here's some keys to success
for older people
uh there's a study that says that adult
education
decreases your risk of dementia
tremendously in other words using your
brain keeps it healthy and not using
your brain allows it to atrophy now did
you need to study to know that
did you need a study to know
that if you exercise a muscle the muscle
might get stronger
if you exercise your brain
brain might be become more capable
so we probably didn't need to study for
that but it's good to know that you can
you have a lot of control over your
dimension
so do something that keeps you active
have I mentioned that I'm retired
but I also have four jobs
so I'm retired with four jobs right if
you count my book
my book which is screaming up the charts
a huge success in changing lives that's
actually true every day people are
telling me it changed their life in some
substantial way every day
somebody tells me it had a major impact
on their life already anyways that's one
of my jobs and of course I still make
the Dilbert comic for subscribers on
locals and on x
and of course I do this
now the reason I do this
in part you know other than keeping
myself interested because it's stuff I
like is that I know it keeps me alive
longer
uh you know I get up every morning and I
have to look through all the news and
keep my brain working you connect things
so I'm basically uh doing a long-term
longevity play and the two things that I
want to get right for longevity and this
would be true for you too continuous
learning
in whatever form you want to do it just
continuous learning but also movement
and resistance training if you get
movement you move a lot you walk you're
going to live a long time those are your
basic things
but the other things are you know
obviously your diet and your sleep and
Dr uberman says get some sun in the
morning and work in your relationships
you're going to be in good shape
pretty basic stuff
how many of you learned that in school
do you remember in school where they
said Well if you get these
you know half dozen things right your
life will be probably good
they don't really tell you that directly
do they
yeah they they kind of suggested maybe
indirectly in a number of ways but they
don't really ever say
here that if you get these eight things
right
see I would go further
you can make a chart all right hold this
in your mind imagine this as a young
person
imagine a chart where on the left are
all the things you have to get right you
know make make sure you take your your
diet you know stay in school get a
talent stack right so so each of those
things is on a matrix list on the left
and then on the top
for everyone that you don't have let's
say one is crossed out
you can see what your annual income
would be
or better a photograph of the home
you're going to live in
right so if you're doing all the things
on the stack
the the picture shows that you live in a
nice big house
if you have one wrong on the stack it's
still a nice house but it's you know
it's down a level
if you get too wrong you're living in an
apartment
you know two bedroom apartment if you've
got three wrong you're living on the
street or something like that yeah but
imagine making that visual a list of
things you have to get right and then
the house you're going to live in based
on how many of the lists you actually
accomplished
now I would say that I do everything on
the list
so if you were to make a list of the
things that you should do you know that
you would recommend people do I do every
one
everyone
now the exception would be I might smoke
a little legal substance in California
so you could argue that that's holding
me back but the evidence doesn't seem to
suggest that
so my result my result in life should be
completely predictable from doing the
eight or so things that you should do to
succeed and I do all eight things and
I'm pretty pretty serious about Ole I
don't just casually do them
you know the fitness for example I'm
pretty serious about I can do better on
sleep but I think everybody's different
there all right here's the key to
anti-success
so now you know all the things you need
to do to be successful
you know your relationships that your
son and your body and all that here's
what you don't want to do according to a
study that didn't need to be done
I could have handled this under sketchy
science here's a study that didn't need
to be done let's see if you could have
known this
without the study
if you talk about your poor Mental
Health on social media it could have an
impact on future employers
I know surprise huh you probably didn't
see that coming
then if you say online you have mental
problems and your employer sees it
they're they're less likely to hire you
than somebody who is smart enough to
shut up about it now it doesn't mean
that the person they hired has fewer
mental problems if there's anything I've
taught you it's that we're all basket
cases but some people hide it a lot
better
yeah once you get to know somebody you
start digging down you're like oh I
didn't know that okay you got some
issues I wasn't wasn't quite aware of
that
but don't put it online
do not put your don't put your mental
condition online now you might say but
Scott you put your Insanity online every
single day
right because I can do this for a living
and I can get canceled and still make a
living if you can get fully canceled and
still make a good living then do
whatever you want then you're me if
you're not me and you can't make a
living after being completely canceled
worldwide and still make it work don't
do it it's not a good it's not a good
risk so stay low stay low
all right uh there's a story that I
didn't need to read
uh that The Tick Tock band some people
wanted but it looks like nothing's gonna
happen
now do you need to know the details
what do you think are the details of the
story about The Tick Tock ban not not
being popular enough in Congress to pass
there's nothing you need to read about
that story is it going to be blah blah
somebody's in favor of it and blah blah
somebody isn't and blah blah reasons
there's nothing that you need to know
about a story about Tick Tock except
the only reason is not banned there is
no other reason
is that Congress is owned by China
or enough of it is you know not every
person of course
there's no other reason
can we be honest about this nobody's
even offered another reason
this Tick Tock is the one thing you
don't see reasons for one side
because the reason is obvious China must
have some major control I mean the fact
that Fox News is running Tick Tock ads
what does that tell you
that tells you they won
that tells you the war has been fought
in China One
if if Fox News is running Tech talk ads
then that's a complete victory
that's a complete route we lost
and they now control our children's
Minds
and they don't allow Tick Tock in China
because they wouldn't want their
children's Minds to be controlled at
least not by not in that way
so
amazingly
the China controls our government in a
substantial way and they control it
enough so that the people who are mostly
parents themselves or were at one point
mostly grandparents and great
grandparents I guess
but these are people who are actually
parents who are selling out children
for what out whatever they get from
China I guess
I don't know what the benefit is
well there's yet more information that
China is becoming uninvestable that's
the
code word of the day more smart people
saying it looks uninvestable and you
know what it is totally uninvestable but
they're doing a good job destroying our
culture and our children and our
families
via take talk
now some of you are saying but but but I
don't have Tick Tock it doesn't matter
if ticak has enough Minds those Minds
will influence you directly or force you
to do what they want so you don't all
have to have Tick Tock they just have to
have enough of the country under their
control and apparently they do now I
don't know if Congress ever figured out
that Tick Tock is a mind controlled tool
I don't even know if they ever figure
that out but it's
shouldn't be should not be a loud noise
in my house right now
I hope that was a dog
anyway
um either the either my dog just sneezed
really loudly or I'm going to be the
victim of home invasion any moment so
watch for that
could be could be a SWAT thing all right
um
so uh the CNN Insurrection hoax now and
I guess the media Insurrection Oaks not
just CNN
um is coming full circle
so that Jamie Raskin Democrat
is saying that because of this
Insurrection which they're trying to
sell to the country as real and it's
obviously not real January 6 as an
Insurrection is there anybody here is
there even any one person here who
thinks that January 6 was an
insurrection
can you show yourself
is there anybody who thinks that was an
actual Insurrection attempt attempt
yeah so there's I don't think there's
anybody
who would be watching this live stream
who actually believes that
you have to be pretty deep into the
brainwashing before that even makes a
little bit of sense
see that that's the one that I wanted to
brainwash a democrat in public
I want to bring a democrat in and say
the following well you and I both agree
that there were some dangerous people
there who probably wanted to overthrow
the government would you agree oh
totally totally what percentage of those
do you think under one percent
definitely under one percent of the
people who were there were you know
serious about anything bad would you
agree that the 99 of them if they
thought it was an Insurrection they
would have brought their weapons because
they're Republicans
and and can you explain to me the
mechanism by which they would overthrow
and control the country via trespassing
without weapons
like can can you just game that out for
me all right on week two where are they
getting their food
where where's the food come from
yeah I mean just explain how how the
occupying without weapons one building
causes them to own the nuclear Triad
like where where's the connecting stuff
just explain how that works and just
watch somebody Fall Apart
just watch somebody just fall apart
because it would be pretty easy to
demonstrate that they've been
brainwashed on that topic especially
so it'd be fun to watch anyway so the uh
the bad guys in the government are
trying to do the well Interruption has
been proven even though Trump is not
even being charged with anything like
insurrection
all that evidence and the legal system
decided there was not enough there to
act and keep in mind you can get an
indictment for
anything
and they still couldn't get an
indictment for any kind of a
Insurrection EU treason charge
they tried
so they could get an indictment for a
ham sandwich as the famous saying goes
but they couldn't get one for
Insurrection do you know why
because you can't convince real people
that an unarmed Insurrection involving
trespassing is actually an interaction
because it obviously isn't
all right here is your tip and I I feel
sorry for Democrats because I don't
think they know that there are some
characters that the Democrats Trot out
when they need to just lie grotesquely
when they're doing normal spin you can
get anybody to go on CNN would you agree
if you're just talking should we are
lower taxes or you know should we shut
down the government until we have a
budget you know if all the ordinary
questions you can get any senator
any any person in Congress to get in
front of a camera and say oh our site is
smart that other side is making a big
mistake as I always do right so you can
get anybody to say something that's just
a narrative spin
but you cannot get
every Democrat to go on on camera and
lie through their teeth while you know
they're doing it
that's something that not all the
Democrats can do
so when you see the small number of
Democrats come out on a given topic
that's your signal that all the honest
Democrats said uh I think I'm on
vacation that day yeah you you go take
care of that I'd love to do it but oh
busy scheduling couldn't do it today but
sure I'd love to do it I just busy
schedule
and so the ones they send out remember
these names Jamie Raskin swalwell Schiff
Nadler uh Carl Bernstein and then
Brennan and Clapper used to be the go-to
have you seen predator and Goldman yes
Dan Goldman so if you see a Goldman
Raskin swalwell Schiff Nadler Bernstein
and then Brett had John bread and
Clapper I think got got retired because
their lying was on the the laptop thing
was just too over the top people said
all right that's that's really over the
top so that they're kind of semi-retired
but I don't know
uh no Ted loses spinner
Ted lose more of a spinner he's just an
innocent spinner
these guys are the professional Liars
so they they know they're lying in my
opinion I can't read their minds right
but given that they always it's always
the same little uh crew that appears
when you need to tell the big lie you
know like the really big one like
January 6 was an Insurrection or the
fine people hoax you know the the big
ones you tried out these guys the laptop
isn't real
Russia collusion hoax so the big big
hoax is the same group same people every
time
now don't you think I could find a you
know a normal Democrat in Congress who
would just not want to talk about this
stuff because they know it's BS of
course
so it's very helpful to know the players
because then you know the story is false
because they only send these players out
when they know the story Souls
all right um I don't want to talk about
masks except to make sure that everybody
is ready to attack the first corporation
that requires masks
now it's hard to attack the government
for requiring them
or a healthcare organization
you know those are tough to attack
because I like our health care
organizations so I I will lay off of
them
um even if you hate it I would lay off
of them but if there's a for-profit
corporation especially
um and I tweeted that you know we should
make sure that we focus all our uh our
hate and protest on the first one that
goes forward I got 2.6 million views on
that
so if you're wondering is are there
enough people who would be willing to
boycott and attack the first corporation
that makes the mistake of going first
2.6 million people and I only have a
million followers
so that means that it left my bubble and
you know got a lot bigger a good a good
tweet for me would be
30 000 views
so if you see 2.6 million that means
you're you're hitting a cord it means
people are activated to act
right this is a pretty strong signal of
action
if I say something that's just a real
clever idea I'll get you know a clever
tweet let's say I'll get 30 000.
but but if I tweet something that would
cause people to actually change what
they do
that's 2.6 million and that's the
indicator of that so I'd be pretty
worried if I were the first Corporation
you get it's going to end up like ESG
you know there's another article I think
it was Charles gasparini in New York
Post
saying that ESG is basically dead but
then other people say who knows God it's
not only the term ESG they're still
going to try to work that stuff in there
but I don't think that's 100 true
I think that's true-ish meaning that
they are in fact trying to work these
things you know into other words and you
know make it look like they're not
gaspari no sorry yeah try to make it
look like it's just you know natural
everywhere but
um I did see some big data
Big Data I saw some data they showed
their big differences in how even
BlackRock is investing so they used to
you know make the ESG stuff
pretty required now there are a number
of investments in which it wasn't
apparently so they seem to be backing
off of their own requirements
which would allow other people to do the
same so it does look like ESG is
just embarrassed to have a business
but I don't mind if companies try to be
good to the environment and I don't mind
if somebody's trying to get some
diversity in their company
if it's optional and good for them and
they want to do it and it's good for the
country they could do that if they like
I just don't like BlackRock forcing them
to do it
or any other big entity it's the force
that's the problem
all right how many of you saw Tucker
Carlson's uh interview with uh the
leader of Hungary
let me tell you some things I learned
how many of you knew that Hungary only
had 10 million people
why did I not know that
because Hungary seems like a country
that's on everybody's you know everybody
can name hungry
like there are countries in Africa that
I never think about probably a few that
I don't even know the names
but hungry is like you know a big
you know talked about country only 10
million people
that's amazing
anyway so Victor Orban who you should
know
is you know kids Saturday right winger
like Trump and he says Trump's the only
one who could stop the Ukraine Russia
War
he says that Russia is 100 going to win
that war
if we just keep going and his argument I
found strong and his argument goes like
this
in the end it's going to depend who runs
out of soldiers now I don't think we
usually have wars where people run out
of soldiers
I'm not really used to that
right it was Vietnam nobody ran out of
soldiers
in the Korean War nobody ran out of
soldiers in World War one and two nobody
ran out of soldiers
right
the Civil War nobody ran out of soldiers
so that so that that's sort of something
I've never seen
and so
uh well you say Germany ran out of
soldiers but that's they were running
low but I don't think that's why they
ultimately lost we just had more of them
wouldn't you say it's more that we just
had more we had more weapons more more
gasoline more oil more more everything
we just out produced them I think
because America was
unmolested by the War World War II we
could ramp up our production and you
know come into it full force
anyway so if you take his theory that
um and maybe this is the new world in
the old world we always had too many men
so you could burn off a bunch of men in
a war and you didn't run out
but we actually have a population bubble
problem we don't have enough young
people like we used to there's a lot of
old people but not a lot of young you
know men and especially men who left the
country in both the Ukraine and Russia
case so they do actually have a a human
limit
and Orban says and I don't know if he's
100 right but I'll just give you his
opinion he says he's very close to it
anybody who's not close to it probably
shouldn't have an opinion but he says
that
um Russia is not running out of money
they seem to be able to get whatever
they need to run their their operation
and they're making adjustments to get
things from other places make deals with
other people working around the boycotts
or the bands and stuff and that Ukraine
is much closer to running out of
soldiers than Russia because Russia
doesn't seem to be protesting or being
that the Russians don't seem to be too
angry about the fact they're in a war
right
um
all right here's what I don't want to
hear I told you Putin would win why are
you saying that to me
because you thought I'd say the opposite
you don't need to say I told you so
first of all it hasn't happened and
second of all I never ruled it out do
you think I told you who was going to
win I told you what could happen
you know I've considered all the
possibilities but at this point you know
when things clarify after the fog of war
is lifted we really it does I I like uh
orban's take on it that it seems like
the technology is going to be there for
both sides
it looks like they're not going to run
out of weapons it looks like they're not
going to run out of things to shoot
it does look like
humans will be the thing they run out of
first and Russia doesn't care
because they have more humans and
apparently the Russian citizens like
Putin one of the things we forget in the
United States
is that the Russians don't think like
Americans they're not thinking give us
freedom stop that war
they're just now thinking that
they're just thinking oh wouldn't it be
good we if we had a strong country that
stayed together and unity might be more
important than you know some notion of
your American Freedom you know I'm not
sure that they care
that they can't protest their government
like
as long as everything's working they're
like well everything's working and even
in given that the Russians probably
don't have full access to everything
that's going on you know they don't see
all the the death and stuff
um by the way I'm I'm uh I'm taking this
from Victor Orban so he's
he knows Russia better than you do
so I don't know if he's right
but that's his take that there's nothing
that's bothering Russia right now except
they're just waiting
and that Putin can wait as long as he
wants because there's nothing to stop
him from waiting and Ukraine will just
run on people
and then he can do whatever he wants
it it's not mind reading
oh man it's not mind reading if I tell
you that my opinion doesn't depend on
what anybody else is thinking
if I told you I knew I was somebody's
thinking that's mind reading
right if I don't do that
not mind reading
just keep that in mind all right
uh Trump's got a new video out saying
that Biden is a quote mental catastrophe
is leading us into World War III a
mental catastrophe
he has a way with words
that's so much better than Dementia or
he's not all there you know we're all
using these words like this and then
Trump goes in He's A Mental catastrophe
I'm thinking yeah
yeah he's a mental catastrophe that's
actually a pretty good choice of words
who who's a better writer Shakespeare or
Trump
who's a better writer
Shakespeare or Trump
well if you're writing a
if you're writing a you know what we
used to call a tweet is Trump
if you're doing something that people
really want to wrestle with and you know
try to figure out what it means and go
to a play and stuff well maybe a
Shakespeare so it depends what you're
writing for but I would say that Trump's
writing for political messaging
um
is as strong or stronger than
Shakespeare they're just different
domains
but he's just wrong in his domain as
Shakespeare is in his domain
or was
all right so I finally figured out what
was going on with my online experience
lately
um because I was getting a lot of
critics that were clearly suffering some
kind of cognitive dissonance situation
about Vivek and I wasn't quite figuring
out what was going on there and I
finally figured out it's the Santa
supporters who are really unhappy right
now and they're having trouble coping
with the fakes rise and they're coming
after me in droves to and every one of
them has a different take on some
rumored thing that they think of a fake
did they're they're all ridiculous
now I saw that uh Dana how do you
pronounce her last name Lash
l-o-e
-sh Lash
is that the it's that's the correct
you're right Lash
so I so heard I believe it's her husband
who were
giving me a little pushback
because they're making claims that he's
changing his position he's a
flip-flopper
so I've challenged them for the best
example of it and uh
Mr lash I forget his first name uh
appointed me to um
Dana lashes you know sub stack in which
she was talking a bunch of cases the
first one I read
was that Vivek claimed he hadn't voted
since some year
but there was evidence that he had voted
as an independent
in a year
that's a flip-flop
somebody said he didn't vote but there
was there was one that one year he voted
does anybody care about that I literally
can't remember if I voted or registered
in the past because there were a lot of
years that I thought I was going to do
it and then I didn't
and then you know 20 years later I can't
remember did I think about it or did I
do it
like I couldn't even tell you if I was
registered democrat or republican in the
past or independent I actually don't
know
because it didn't matter when I did it
when you're when you're 20 and you pick
a party
if it's not just you know the party of
your parents or something maybe you care
about it but it felt random to me
I just randomly picked picked a party
and I don't remember which one I picked
so do you care if a young man
forgets that he voted a certain way
does that matter in any way and that's
like that was like number one on the
list
so I started to read the second one and
I thought no I'm not going to do the
laundry list
so I asked is it Chris Chris Lash is
that his first name
uh I hope I I hope I got his name right
anyway uh
I think it's Chris but anyway I asked
him to give me his his best one example
and you know that's how you handle the
laundry list say give me your best
example if that's persuasive I'll I'll
engage on the rest of the examples
does that seem fair
if you if your best one sells me well
then maybe the other ones are pretty
good too I'll take a look so I think
that's a fair you know ticket to the
play
so um I I haven't seen if he's answered
that yet because it just happened this
morning before I got on but here's one
of the examples of of the vague being a
flip-flopper and this comes from Dana
Lash
so what exactly is I think I have this
right
that the claim is that at one point
Vivek said that the plan was until 2028
when or no I'm sorry until we get our uh
our chips back which he wants to do by
around 2028 and we can manufacture chips
in America he says until then we would
tell China we're definitely going to
defend Taiwan
but then after we get the chips back it
would be he would consider that more of
a you know let's say uh what do you call
a China's problem basically
now
he is he is now describing it as he
would
say we would definitely
um defend Taiwan while we need their
chips so what seems like a modification
the first part's the same
so he hasn't ever changed the fact that
he would say definitively we will
militarily defend Taiwan until we can
make our own chips so in in both of his
stories he's always said that so that's
not the part he's being accused of
flip-flopping so until we get our chips
we defend them it's the after that
so after he said well after that he used
to say something like then it's more of
a China internal problem
at the moment he's saying we would
return to strategic ambiguity which is
China doesn't know what we're going to
do and then I I believe if I've got her
argument right that Dana lash's argument
is that that's a flip-flop
a flip-flop from you know we're not
gonna We're not gonna be their Defender
once we get our chips back
to strategic ambiguity which is our
current situation
is that a flip-flop
does that sound like a flip-flop to you
to me it sounds exactly the same
I I feel like if your filter is that is
a flip-flopper then you imagined you saw
it if your filter is not a flip-flop
those things sound exactly the same
here's why they sound exactly the same
strategic ambiguity should be just
assumed
so he didn't say it the first time
but I assumed it
and then when he did say it I said oh
well of course
why would you give up strategic
ambiguity when is free
you just have to not tell China what
you're going to do and let them wonder
about it
and maybe that keeps them from attacking
your ally but by no means
would anybody drop strategic ambiguity
when it's free and it's worked so far
and we're talking about an ally so of
course we would use it to imagine that
he ever thought we were going to say so
in order for him to be a flip-flopper
you would have to imagine that he said
and this would be a lot of imagining
that we're going to be really you know
clear about defending Taiwan but as soon
as we're done we're going to tell China
hey it's all yours
free free pass you got it do you believe
that you know that that's where the
reality test come said really
really
you really think that a presidential
candidate of of his capabilities went in
front of the public and said that after
we get our chips back we're going to
just give our Ally to China
despite how unhappy they would be about
that really
nobody would ever say that
so you don't have to wonder if Vivek
said it you can know with some certainty
that no one would say that because it
would just be dumb and at the very least
none of the candidates are that Bell
so a lot of these things that people are
seeing as flip-flops are either
completely trivial
about whether he remembered that time he
voted
or ones that there and I've told you
this there's this weird thing where
people are pointing to a source that
disagrees with them and telling you it
says the opposite
and actually I think they believe it I
don't think they're lying I think they
believe they're reading something that's
actually the opposite of what it says
so it's a lot of motivated reasoning
so once you start seeing that what's
happening is people are just having a
reaction
to the fact that they thought DeSantis
was going to be their their candidate
and they'd feel good about it and now
they're watching him fail to Vivek still
I think he still had the polls but not
every poll
um
so Nathan he's still arguing obviously a
DeSantis supporter so let me read
Nathan's comment he says he literally
said quote as soon as we're done with
them it's your problem China
do you believe that's an actual quote
because you put quotes around it that do
you believe that that there's somewhere
that the actual course because this is
the trick you also see
people are putting in quotes things he
never said and never would say
he might say it's their problem
so so I'm going to accept your your
characterization your characterization
is that you said after that it's China's
problem
well that's true
you that he's always said that
but that doesn't say that we wouldn't
employ strategic ambiguity because it's
free right
why wouldn't we it's still their problem
that's just a fact that he's never he's
never backed off of that
but it doesn't mean that we wouldn't be
involved
it's just their problem
yeah
so I think you I think you're trying
really hard to make this some kind of a
flip-flop and then my other my other
comment is whenever somebody is accused
of being a flip-flopper
it's always because they can't find the
angle of attack
it's always because flip-flopper is the
weakest of all it's the hypocrite thing
oh you said this but now you said this
usually people are just misinterpreting
something he said or taking it out of
context or the situation changed and he
changed his mind
for example on January 6
he was one of the many people left and
right who said they didn't like the way
Trump handled January 6.
but today he says he would he would
pardon him
are those is that a flip-flop
he didn't like anything Trump did on
January 6. and he would pardon him today
so is that a change no that there those
are different topics one is what do you
have handled it the same way no
and the other is should he go to jail
forever for free speech
no
so I I mean it's Pure Imagination that
he's flip-flopping on these things but I
think the desensis people are just
having a moment
I feel sorry for Jake Tapper on CNN
didn't you used to think that being a a
host on a big news program would be like
a you know a real fun job and
a lot of you know you get a lot of
credit and
the public would love you and stuff and
I watched him interviewing uh karinge
John Pierre
and she was talking about Biden's you
know
energy level
and she said quote it is hard for us to
keep up with this president who is
constantly constantly working every day
to get things done
two constantly's
two constant leads as you tell for
lie that's a little too many constant
leaves in one sentence
but imagine and then they do a wide shot
so you see Jake Tapper listening to her
and he's just sort of looking at her
like a clown
now in politics we often call people
clowns oh it's a clown clown clown but
she's the only one who actually reminds
me of a clown physically
while actually talking like a clown
it's the first time he's ever really
worked you know that clown thing
because everybody gets called the clown
but they don't look like it and
literally they talk like it she actually
talks like a clown
while having clown hair
which is weird because I love her look
if you took her out of that job you know
and I just ran into her in the corporate
world my I know some of you you don't
like her look I just think she's really
stylish I think she has a great look I
like looking at her actually when she's
on I'll actually pause and say damn
she's she's well put together I like the
I just like the style of her her whole
approach but if you take that style and
put it in front of the country and then
talk like a clown
that's that's the wrong mix
right I like her look
but don't talk like a clown in front of
the country and then they're gonna say
you look like a clown
like I did
all right
here are two things
um that only people who don't understand
anything about business believe are good
points number one and one will be on the
left and one is on the right
one is that uh Hunter Biden needed
experience to be a board member of a
major corporation
now how many of you know that board
members are not even chosen for
experience that's not a thing you don't
choose board members for experience in
the industry
that you're not even trying
now there might be board members who do
have experience and wouldn't it be nice
to have at least one of those right
having one or two would be great
but generally you're picking them
specifically from other Industries
sometimes because that gives you let's
say a connection to the other industry
that might be useful or some eyes onto
something happening in another industry
that might be useful to you or they're
just powerful people who are prestigious
to have on your board or they're just
really smart who wouldn't want uh Warren
Buffett on their board
right I mean if you have the option
maybe a younger Warren Buffett but
everybody would take him you would not
say oh I can't have Warren Buffett
because he doesn't have you know
experience in the oil industry or
something
so now
the the charges and every time I see
somebody on Fox News usually say and uh
you know and Hunter who was on this
board and you know it's crooked because
he didn't have any experience that's not
a thing
those pure
lack of understanding of what a board is
I mean I don't it looks intentional but
I'm going to give I'm going to give them
the benefit of a doubt that they don't
know what a board is or how it works
um somebody says the director should
have experience that's probably true
yeah the board of the director of the
board of directors
um so here's the other one
yeah you hear this from the left
that China gave Ivanka a bunch of
trademarks and like oh wow I I guess
she's been bought off with a bunch of
trademarks because China just like gave
them to her these valuable trademarks
wow wow I I guess that's proof that the
trumps were working with China all along
huh
all right let me explain to you if
you've never applied for a trademark how
to get a trademark in China
you ready I'm going to show you the
entire process from beginning to end
email
hello my lawyer this is Scott
I would like to get a trademark on the
the following thing in the attachment of
my email
can you let me know when that's done
a trademark in China please
and then I send it
and then months later I'll get an email
back from my lawyer it'll say uh here's
your trademark
that's it
the only thing the process does is they
look to see if somebody already uses
your trademark and I don't even think
they look that hard for that
I'm not even sure they look too hard
because they'll let you battle it down
if you took somebody's trademark
registering trademark is just like a few
bucks in a little paperwork
in all likelihood the the person who
actually registered it in China does not
know who Ivanka Trump is
and has no idea that they even
registered a trump trademark
it's just you know they're just stamping
papers and putting it through you know
stamp uh
stamp yeah so so the left has this idea
that it's obvious that the trumps have
been bribed because she got a trademark
she files some paperwork
I I have trademarks in China
I'm not guessing that's how I got him
send an email to my lawyer and then I
have a trademark in China just like you
can do exactly like you could do
all right then the other one is that the
Saudis gave Jared Kushner two billion
dollars
like the people on the left believe that
they just gave them a check for two
billion dollars
that didn't happen
no Jared created an investment fund
that would use his expertise that he had
developed of you know knowing everybody
in the world and especially knowing the
Middle East and I believe it was a
Middle East investment fund right so it
was it was specific to the area
the Saudis being good friends personal
friends with Jared right they're
actually personal friends they know each
other they've been very successful
working together they know that Jared is
a high-end investor guy I mean that's
his background and that he knows
everybody now
so if you know everybody and you're an
investment guy
you can get lots of people to do
Investments and you can find good deals
now
every bit of this was announced publicly
there was a press release from the Jared
Kushner people and probably Saudi Arabia
announcing the deal
Jared doesn't keep the money is still
Saudi Arabia's money he would just be
one of the people managing it
so is it a sweetheart deal yeah probably
probably is there a political
consideration to it like Saudi Arabia
thinks you know every time we put a
little money towards somebody who has
some influence in America
in an indirect way that's probably going
to come back to benefit us yes
absolutely
but here's why I'm not bothered by it
it's fully transparent
they announced it they told you exactly
what they're doing
you know and it's legal it's legal and
it's transparent those are the highest
standards of appropriate behavior
legal and transparent now what what the
uh the bidens did
maybe they found a way to make it legal
I'm not an expert on the fairer part of
that
but
it wasn't transparent that's for sure so
that's very different
all right
um
all right
it does look like everybody's trying to
get rid of Joe Biden Newsmax host Greg
Kelly
has teased that he has heard from people
who have heard it but he hasn't heard it
directly there's some audio tape that
has incontrovertible evidence of Joe
Biden's corruption and that Biden would
have to leave the office immediately
if it were released and it's going to be
released in several weeks
uh does that sound real
does that sound like something that's
going to happen just the way it sounds
like it's going to happen
now I don't I'm not going to make a any
negative comments about Newsmax or Greg
Kelly because I don't know anything
about either one of them I'm just saying
This falls into the category of things
that always disappoint well mostly I
mean
we could be surprised
but it has a has a crack and feel to it
doesn't it it's very crackinish
it's like a big claim that somebody who
knows somebody is going to do something
sometime in the future
yeah there's every every tell for
something that's not going to pan out
but
maybe it's certainly not impossible
so recreationally let's keep an eye on
it
I would call this recreational news the
the the odds of it panning out and being
true pretty low but the entertainment
Factor pretty high pretty high so
there's that
um and that would there is it does look
as though the Democrats themselves are
starting to put pressure on Biden to get
him to change his mind if that's the
problem
doesn't it look like the Democrats are
pressuring Biden to leave
that's what it looks like to me they're
putting a little bit a little bit more
pressure and if there's somebody secret
audio tape that would kind of seal the
deal that they're trying to get rid of
them
yeah
all right remind me
I already forgot I was going to tell you
to remind me of something and as I was
forming the sentence I forgot what it
was
oh dopamine
remind me when I'm done with my notes to
talk about dopamine
all right
um
a lot of people have been criticizing
for vague's candidacy because they say
experience counts
you know he's never held a job in
government and although sure he's got
this experience in in the private sector
he has no government experience and
people want to see somebody with
government Experience run for president
so I have some I have eight questions
for people who think that government
experience specifically is uh is
essential for a president
question number one
how's that working out so far
Joe Biden's got a lot of experience how
does that work okay question number two
which major changes in our world were
created by people with prior experience
in their own industry
uh Apple computer
Steve Jobs
uh SpaceX
Google
are there any big changes let's say in
the technology area in which the founder
actually had experience in that domain
turns out you don't really need
experience in that domain yeah IBM was a
A salesperson
so as somebody who had computer
experience but also Ross Perot
you have experience as a salesperson so
that kind of that carried over
all right number three why does
collecting a paycheck for one government
job make you qualified for a government
job with different duties
how does that work I'm trying to
understand that
how does let's say
let's say you were a mayor
how does that make you a good
commander-in-chief
there's nothing that everything
everything about the presidency is its
own thing
nobody has experience as a president
and they have plenty of advisors who
have experience giving them opposite
advice so what happens when all the
people who do have experience are
sitting in the room with you and their
advice is opposite
that's what experience gets you opposite
advices yeah well I got experience I say
x I got experience I say not X
so advice experience has a advantage
but it's pretty Limited
um
who is more likely to be corrupt an
outsider who's never worked in
government or a career politician
who's more likely to be corrupt
the guy with a 600 million whatever yes
he's independently rich or the person
who's worked in the corrupt place for
their career
because Congress is basically corrupt
I'm not saying every politician I like
Thomas Massey
you know uh you know there are a number
of them I like and that who as far as I
can tell don't have a tinge of
corruption whatsoever but as a body it's
a pretty corrupt body so career
politicians seem the least trustable
people in terms of bribery and
Corruption
um who's more likely to make big changes
in the world if you think we need big
changes an entrepreneur or a career
politician
who's more likely to not know what can't
be done
I'd rather have somebody who doesn't
know what can't be done that's how
anything gets done
um who
let's see who's more likely to feed the
military-industrial beast an outsider or
a career politician well the career
politician is probably tied to the
military-industrial complex and always
has been
right but somebody comes from the
outside if you were to win which would
be tough
he's not he has no beholden to that
industry so somebody like a trump who is
not invested in that industry would be
or if a fake would be a good choice for
that
um and then here's my favorite one
number eight how long does it take
someone like Vivek to learn everything a
president needs about a complicated
topic
one day
see I don't think that the average
person understands how smart smart can
be
because we kind of you know start with
our own intelligence and go well I can
sort of imagine what 10 smarter would
feel like
but you can't really imagine what twice
as smart feels like
you can you can't really imagine twice
as smart so he's in that so much smarter
I don't know if it's twice but he's so
much smarter than just average people
that I don't think that they have a
concept of how how quickly he could pick
up a not only pick up a complicated
topic but here's the fun part
how quickly he could integrate it with
his knowledge of other fields from
Pharma to law to politics to
yeah a lot of things he follows
so
anyway
um
Byron Donald's you know you know
Congress and Byron Donald's good uh good
uh associate uh what's what's the best
word supporter of President Trump
who the New York Times calls an
ex-president but they call Obama a
former president
did you know that
New York Times in the same in the same
day we'll call Trump an ex-president and
Obama a former president
so anyway
Byron Donald's Congressman Donalds who
is getting a lot of positive attention
lately and I would Echo that he seems he
seems really charismatic
and he talks really well in public in
terms of being persuasive
so he's super persuasive super
charismatic he looks smart
he just says a lot of smart stuff
and
he's saying if there's one real charge
coming it's Rico against Joe so now he's
using Rico
and saying it out loud Rico you know the
the law
is in law is recall a law that allows
the law enforcement to treat an
Enterprise as a coordinated criminal
entity so it's a coordinated criminal
ongoing coordinated criminal entity so
he's saying that that could be a charge
against Joe Biden but I think it's way
bigger than that
it's obvious to me that the media has
colluded with the Democrats the
intelligence operatives have
um probably the FBI the doj in some ways
so
to me the the Ricoh case is obvious
and I don't know that you could approve
it because it's going to look like
somebody at a meeting nobody took notes
so it's going to be a lot of meetings we
know about with people who maybe
shouldn't have been talking and they're
just going to say well you know we just
thought we'd get together so it might be
hard to prove
but have you heard any other prominent
Republican say that a RICO investigation
against the Democrats would make sense
you see the first prominent person to
say Rico
who's actually an elected official
give me a give me a fact check on that
have you heard anybody say Rico about
the Democrats before
no
um yeah you've heard me say it
all right so here's a question I'm
asking that will make more sense to
people who've been following me for a
while
do you think that the fact that I said
it on Twitter
and I got a good response to it like
nobody said I was crazy
do you think that allowed somebody who
is more respectable to say it did it
make it easier
yeah because I know I know for example
new follows me I follow him too
yeah and it's one of the smartest people
in the game
um
I don't know if actually well I can't
check I don't know if uh Congressman
Donald follows me but I follow him I
follow him so generally if you're in
that business and somebody who has a
million followers and a good opinion of
you follows you usually you follow back
they have that that would just be sort
of routine
so I don't know if he's seen me say it
and I'm not I'm not making that claim
I'll make a general claim
people like me have a unique place in
the ecosystem of information
because I'm not embarrassed and at the
moment I'm so totally canceled that I
can say anything so I can I can float an
idea just because it sounds like a good
idea to me
and then other people could say oh he
survived that idea nobody mocked him now
I can say it
so I think people like me and I'm not
I'm not the only one you can name 10
other people
pretty quickly you know the Mike
cernovich is I use them for every
example
um
that if they test out a message and it
works somebody picks it up
all right
um
I wanna I wanna toss out a uh
explanation
for the division in the country
all right and it's one you haven't heard
before I tested it out on my man cave
live stream last night got a good
response so I'm gonna try it again
and it goes like this if you if you uh
talk to somebody in person
How likely are you in 2023 to want to
get into a political conversation
I'm going to answer the question for you
while I watch your answers
probably close to zero because you know
that in 2023 if you get into a political
conversation with somebody whose views
you don't already know now if it's
somebody who's really close to you and
you already know their views and you're
just saying something you know they're
going to agree with that's fine
but you would not enter a let's say a
cocktail party without knowing the
people
and launch into a political conversation
because your odds of you know they're
being on your side or you know 25 or
something so people will stay away from
the person all right now let me turn
that into a mechanical process
so now I described it on a social
conceptual level now I'm going to turn
it into a machine
what what would be your experience if
you got into a political conversation
and it turned ugly
you would produce cortisol
your body would produce cortisol and
that makes you feel bad
because it'd be tense
so tension makes you feel bad and trains
you not to do it so that's why we don't
do it in person
now let's go to social media
when I see a tweet from Rob Reiner
and I think you know I'll bet I could
make my followers laugh with this clever
cutting rejoinder
and they'll send my little you know
little post
and I'll get a bunch of you know
positive reinforcement retweets and
hearts and I'll get a I'll get a bump of
dopamine
so when I'm in person I don't cause
Division I just get along with everybody
because I don't want cortisol and that's
my only option
it well the risk right I mean maybe I
could find somebody like-minded but I'm
not going to take the risk of a cortisol
like cluster bomb that I created for
myself
but online it's nothing but dopamine
so I'm like I don't mean addicted it's
just an addiction
so the division in the country is not an
in-person division
we all know that
we all know the division is fake
because we only do it online
if you put me in person with anybody you
could you could drop me into a crowd of
the most rabid you know Democrat
anti-trumpers and if they didn't ask me
any political questions and let's say
they didn't recognize me I could get
along fine
I wouldn't have the slightest problem
in a in an event where every single
person was a progressive I wouldn't have
any problem I could easily get along
with them
make permanent friends
but as soon as you put me online I'm
just a dopamine fiend
so when we're talking about the division
if you want to talk about the division
conceptually and who said what you get
nowhere
you don't get any understanding what's
happening uh you know if you ask most
people what's causing the division what
would they say well the other side duh
I'll tell you who's causing the division
it's those people I'm getting my
dopamine hit insulting the people that
I'm getting uh my rocks off from
insulting they are the cause but I might
as well enjoy it I mean I might as well
enjoy mocking them because I didn't
cause it like I'm not it's not me but of
course it's you
you're getting your dopamine hit they're
getting their dopamine hit
it's dopamine
so as long as there's a dopamine reward
for division you get more of it
but as soon as you walk out the door to
the real world you can't get that hit
is simply not available to you so you go
into a different chemical uh
cost benefit analysis you go well I
don't want any cortisol and that's the
only thing available because I get in
some stupid fight that I don't need
so every time you fall into the Trap
that the people on you the other side of
you politically are a broken problem you
know monsters and they must be defeated
just remember that's your addiction
talking
that's your addiction talking it's just
like if you were unfentanyl and you had
an opinion that the fentanyl had given
you like oh it doesn't really hurt me
you know whatever the fentanyl tells you
to think
right so you're the pair it's it's just
the dope I mean that's making you talk
once you realize this is a reframe by
the way by the way if you didn't know
I wrote an amazing best-selling book
that you can buy right now in all its
forms pretty soon we'll have the
hardcover
in in days
um
so here's the reform the reframe is
you're addicted to dopamine there is no
division in the country
and you know when I said the the
dissentence people are coming after me
uh with like weird
you know just flailing claims about
Vivek that don't pan out in my opinion
uh
I don't feel bad about them and I don't
feel that they're my enemies because you
know I would be perfectly happy with the
president DeSantis
they're definitely not on the other team
for me but at the moment they're acting
out and the acting out to me looks like
they're they're desperately searching
for dopamine because they're having a
they're having a negative well probably
a dopamine a disadvantage because their
candidates not killing it right now and
Vivek is so if you see it as some people
having a dopamine emergency that they
were all happy that oh I I picked the
right one this time
imagine I mean I guess I have to imagine
it because I didn't do it imagine if I
thought DeSantis was going to carry me
over the the line to Victory
and then it just all fell apart or it
looks like it's falling apart
you wouldn't feel good
and you'd probably act out and that's
what we're seeing
so
just remember
you're an addict you're not somebody who
has division with anybody in the country
and here's the second thing every time
you fall into the Trap of talking about
the average black person or the average
white person or the average anything
else you're you're falling into somebody
else's trap
if you treat everybody as an individual
you'll be fine
so don't buy into the narrative that
anything matters about our averages
but but but Scott it's true I know
but but but in the real world there's
discrimination I know
I'm just not interested
because you know what
everybody's got a problem
you don't have the special one
are you a victim of discrimination in
some context probably
do you think it's as much as I am at
five foot eight and bold
probably not
probably not yeah I don't care about
your problem
I don't care at all yeah I do care about
your progress
I do care about if you need to build
some skills
I do care that if I can help you uh
defeat your problem through any kind of
personal help I do care about that but I
don't care that you the average of the
people that you decided to relate with
is lower than the average of people who
frankly are not me
don't involve me in the average of my
group I'm not an average person
you're not either nobody is that's
that's how averages work nobody's the
average person so as soon as you say I'm
an average you know I'm somehow
representing white people no nope
white people are on their own
all you white people not only are you on
your own everybody else is too and I
won't take credit
for the one percent of white people who
are killing it
right have you ever seen me take credit
for inventing the light bulb because I'm
also White
nope nope I do not take credit for the
light bulb how about um
you know the the white people who built
Big companies that are worth billions do
I do I take credit because I'm also
white nope I didn't do anything to make
Google a success I didn't do anything to
make apple or or Microsoft a success I
didn't do anything
I had no involvement whatsoever so no I
don't get any credit for what the
average white person does but I'm not
going to take any blame
you know if I'm not taking credit I'm
definitely not going to take the blame
so don't tell me what the average person
did don't tell me about a black person
attacking a white person don't tell me
about a white person attacking a black
person don't care
now of course I care on an individual
level right it's not a lack of empathy
is is a where do you put your attention
and do you let yourself be hypnotized
into thinking that a the average of one
group should be compared to the other
and then you act
no if researchers want to look at the
average cool
right if researchers want to look at the
averages maybe they learn something but
keep it away from me
I don't want to hear about it
because you you're if you have a
discrimination that's affected you
that's probably true
but it's also not my problem I have my
own problems
you know everybody's getting
discriminated against for something
would you rather be a educated black man
in America or fat
right by the way I don't I do not
do fat shaming I'm just giving you a
real world example
seriously there are people who are
saying they'd rather be overweight than
black
I don't think you thought this through
if you had a college education and
you're black
let's say but not having a college
education and you're obese and you would
pick obese
I want to hear you say that again
yeah there are people who would pick it
that's amazing I don't think you
understand what America is in 2023.
the the black man with a college
education can get anything
the person who's obese
is going to have trouble getting a date
much less a job
so
yeah I don't know I guess maybe this is
a deeper conversation but I don't really
get that choice
so my point is uh
is there systemic racism yes I would say
it's obvious mostly in the education
field
so I'm willing to fix education because
it needs to be fixed but not because the
average of one group is doing worse than
the other and I do think you have to let
the the cities fail
just let them go
utility at bottom one say it bottom then
you can get involved but until they hit
bottom they're not going to accept the
kind of help they need so I wish your
energy doing that but if anybody wants
to get out
uh that's a possibility
all right
don't speak from the other side they are
out to get you
well did I deny that
I I don't think I denied that people are
out to get me or maybe out to get you
there are certainly people around to get
us
that would be probably true of everybody
who speaks in public there's always
somebody out to get them
um
and it's also true that every group
wants their group to be the successful
one
so what surprises are there
all right
uh
uh
where energy luck is the idea that we
should leave the cities or let them die
oh
um
how do you make compatible these two
concepts when I said leave the cities
but in other times this is a good
question actually in other contexts I've
said you should go where the energy is
which is where there's a concentration
of people usually
and the answer is when I say leave the
sentence I mean the ones that are
falling apart
I I believe there's still plenty of
republican-run cities that look just
like they always did am I wrong
you know when I say get out and say
these the implied assumed depart is
mostly the democrat-run cities mostly
you know it might be some some
exceptions
so
he said pink
all right
um
it's not assumed well it should be
all right that's all I got for now
ladies and gentlemen thanks for joining
