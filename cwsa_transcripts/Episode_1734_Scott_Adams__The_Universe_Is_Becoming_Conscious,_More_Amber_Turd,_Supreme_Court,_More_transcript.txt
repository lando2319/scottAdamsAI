highlight of civilization it's called
coffee with scott adams and
if you didn't think that was enough
then it really is enough
let's take it to another level because
we can
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
a tanker chelsea stein a canteen joker
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine is anything
that makes everything better
um it's called the simultaneous sip
it's gonna happen now and watch what
happens to your dopamine level
whoa it's gonna start surging in a
moment
you ready for this
dopamine get ready systems go
delightful
all right here's a question for you
do you believe yes or no
that hypnosis could raise your dopamine
level
go now we'd be talking temporarily you
know during
during the time of the suggestions
what do you say
almost all of you seem to be saying yes
few knows
yes of course
um
have i ever done it i've have i ever
intentionally raised somebody's dopamine
with hypnosis
oh yeah
oh yeah
yeah under the right conditions you can
send it through the roof
um but
can everybody do that i don't know i
mean
i've never even talked about it with
another hypnotist so i don't know
um i can't teach you how
sadly
i wish i could
but i can't first of all it would take
you years of
of
practice
and uh because that because of the
nature of it i can't tell you what it is
just trust me it's a thing
so it makes me wonder why there's not
more attention to this
one of the things we know is that uh if
you can take a time away from your
screens and your social media if you
just take some time off that does seem
to make you healthier and happier and
probably boosts your dopamine too
so we do have tools for directly
boosting
our moods without drugs
why is it there more of it
isn't that a weird i actually google to
see if there are any studies on hypnosis
and
and dopamine and there's some you know
some indirect references and stuff but
it doesn't look like anybody
tested it directly
which would be not too hard would it
would it be i don't think it would be
that hard so i'm pretty sure you can
hypnotize people into
higher dopamine and therefore higher
happiness and satisfaction everything
else
japan announced that it's going to
be using nuclear reactors to reduce
dependence on russian energy
everything is going in the same
direction with nuclear
it's it's really amazing
it's probably one of the greatest
persuasion success stories of all time
literally
saving the world
maybe depending on your point of view
about the danger of climate change
but
uh it's just i i can't get over how
insanely
effective this was that people like
michael shellenberger and
mark schneider and a number of other
people actually just
turned this battleship around i think
so
that's that's just the best news in the
whole uh universe right now
here was a small part of the story that
i think i missed until i saw a video of
it so you all know about
dave chappelle was giving his comedy
presentation on stage doing some stand
up and some crazy person in the audience
ran up and tackled him
and
uh apparently this guy was
caught and injured in in the catching
and
uh what i didn't realize is that chris
rock who was in the audience
coincidentally
came up on stage and you know grabbed
the microphone from chappelle and asked
was that will smith
now that's one of the best natural jokes
you'll ever hear
like because the situation created
something that could not have been more
perfect it had to be chappelle getting
attacked
chris rock being in the audience
will smith is still being in our minds
i mean
that's why chris rock is chris rockin
and you and i are not chris rock talk
about talk about seeing an opportunity
and grabbing it
that was pretty awesome
so is it interesting that every day that
goes by chris rock looks better
and uh will smith looks worse
am i wrong
i think chris rock came out of this
looking
better than he's ever looked
probably
all right rasmussen has a poll
says the majority of voters think joe
briden shouldn't seek re-election in
2024
what is that majority um
and he would lose a rematch with trump
a hypothetical rematch by double digits
margins
so 61 percent of likely u.s voters this
is again
per rasmussen
um believe biden should not run for a
second term 61
and only 28 think he should seek
re-election
uh if
uh the question was also asked if biden
were running against trump
50 would vote for trump while only 36
would vote for biden
i mean that would just be a total
blowout
but
uh the hypothetical match-up between
florida governor ron desantis
and biden would still show desantis
winning cleanly but not by as much
he would be 46
to 35.
but you have to assume that if desantis
actually ran
you know it got past the primary his
name recognition would
then become somewhat similar to trump's
probably the margins would be similar
i would think
but desantis has much less name
recognition outside of the political
followers such as you and such as me
so what do you think do you believe that
does that does that poll sound about
what you thought
i definitely can see that there would be
a number of democrats who don't think
biden should run again
and then if you add all every every
single
republican who thinks that
yeah that sounds about right 61 don't
think he should run again
but i am
the one the numbers that i think are the
least believable
are anything about a
rematch because that's sort of a steady
state prediction
a steady state means that none of the
variables change everything you know
today stays roughly the same but that
never happens there's zero chance of
that so anything that says you know what
a matchup would look like cannot account
for all the surprises
and those would be probably decisive
like hunter biden's laptop
for example
all right adam schiff
uh tweeted this
about the supreme court leak on roe
versus wade he said i don't care how the
draft leaked that's a sideshow
what i care about is a small number of
conservative justices who lied about
their plans to the senate and tend to
deprive millions of women of
reproductive care
codifying roe isn't enough he says
we must expand the court
now
even joe biden is not in favor of
expanding the court
and the reason is
it would destroy the entire system
if everybody who came in could just add
to the court and then have a court that
would do whatever they wanted you've
ruined your entire
you know balance of power the entire
everything that makes the system work
would be gone it would be the most
fundamental part of the system
and just be gone you have the the
competitive nature of the the different
branches
um
so adam schiff is in favor of the thing
that would literally destroy the
republic
and he still got a job
he was the one who pushed the russia
collusion
that almost destroyed the country
and he didn't get penalized for that
so here's the question that i ask and i
ask this in all seriousness
how many ways can one person
tried to injure the republic
before you have to ask who is paying him
am i right
he doesn't look like he's working for
the united states
he doesn't even look like he's working
for democrats
right
joe biden looks like he's working for
democrats
if if i can say that you know
unpopular opinion
joe biden looks like he's trying to make
the world a better place and he has a
you know a democrat world view about it
but adam schiff doesn't look like that
adam schiff just looks like he's trying
to destroy the republic
how many times does he have to do
something that doesn't look productive
like it looks like it's designed to make
things worse
before you have to ask who the is
paying him
that's a fair question
because if somebody continually acts
just like a democrat
i don't have any question about that
he's acting like a democrat and the
republicans are acting like republicans
okay
and maybe even some of them are more
extreme than others
okay
none of none of that looks like
any kind of foreign interference
but as soon as you throw in the stuff
that schiff does
like russia collusion and expanding the
court
these are literally system destroying
concepts that he's a primary voice
behind
i don't see him as like other democrats
he looks like he's working for another
country
now i'm not that's not a
accusation
because i don't have any data to support
that
but if somebody continually acts in a
fashion that doesn't look even political
it doesn't look like it's good for the
country it doesn't even look political
it looks literally like he's working for
russia
not saying he is he just acts exactly
like it
or china i suppose
well my series about dave the new
engineer
who
if you're watching a color version of
the strip which doesn't run on every
paper
you can see these colorized in a way
that would make him look like he is
black
but he was hired to help the diversity
quota
within the dilbert universe
and but dave does not play along
we learn he's a prankster and he refuses
to identify as black
even though he was hired for that
purpose
now he's qualified
we're not suggesting he's not a
qualified engineer
but the the 20-year boss says he was
trying to you know improve his diversity
so
um so far here's the blowback
from dave the engineer who is black
and
identifies as white
uh i have received in total now this is
just the ones i know about
so
a lot of people complain to me in a lot
of different ways i don't see all the
complaints of course
but
as far as i know
out of can somebody do the math for me
13 of 370 million citizens are in this
country are black and american
out of all the black americans in the
entire country
now of course they're not all reading
dilbert of course
but
i don't think i receive one complaint
that i'm aware of
nobody that i know is black
and i you know you can't know for sure
but if you're looking at the profiles
and what people tell you nobody
uh so the first thing i did was confirm
a suspicion that i've had for a long
time
it's very racist
but i'm gonna say it i'm gonna say it in
public anyway
it's super racist it's like really
racist
are you ready for this
i've always suspected that black people
have a good sense of humor
because it seems that way
whenever i meet somebody who's black
i'm always laughing
right
now
of course
that's just a bigoted
you know anecdotal
biased
not based on any data
but it sure feels like it right
you meet a white guy sometimes they have
a good sense of humor or sometimes they
don't but it's pretty rare
in my own experience to me anybody black
women doesn't have a good sense of humor
this is rare
now
so here i did a comic which literally
had nothing but respect
for the black character nothing but
respect
because he's treated as a high
functioning
engineer because he got the job
he is one of the crowd
and he's got a good sense of humor and
he's he's mocking the boss like the
other cartoon like the other characters
do
so it's nothing but positive
and so when black people looked at it
said oh added a black character we like
that maybe i don't know who knows what
anybody's thinking
and no problem here
but the trans community is up in arms
the comic has nothing to do with trans
anything it's not directly or indirectly
talking about them
it really is just about how the
employees in the office deal with this
you know awkward situation basically
so
you cannot
make everybody happy if you wondered can
you make everybody nope nope you can't
oh don't tempt me
damn it
i've just been challenged
not not in direct words but somebody
said i should make dave the black
character also trans
oh how i hate you
i hate your freaking guts right now
because you know how much i want to do
that i want to do that
oh i want to do that
[Laughter]
damn it
damn it
no i probably won't because it just
complicates things
but i hate to be challenged that way
because it's just too tempting to do it
all right i'm weak
are you watching the uh amber turd
trial she got to testify
uh it is really fascinating
she
she does the cry face without tears
like she's the worst actress in the
world the only professional actress who
can't cry on command
and she doesn't even look like a good
liar
it is so
well you know i can't read her mind so
i'll be
i'll be humble about what i can really
know about her private thoughts but the
way it comes across is so disingenuous
whereas johnny depp's story came across
as quite believable
now here's the interesting thing
we've had expert testimony
the amber heard seems to have some
borderline personality
trait or
some hysterical thing or maybe she's a
vulnerable narcissist anyway she's in
that
class b group of personality disorders
according to an expert
now if you're on the trial
and you hear an expert say yes we've
diagnosed this person as a person with
these personality traits
there's something missing in the
diagnosis
what would have been really useful and
perhaps johnny depp's attorney will get
to this
is that if you're in that class of class
b people
you don't tell the truth
that's a defining characteristic
now
i got some pushback what i call that
lying
i called it lying and
you know a medical doctor pushed back
and said well maybe it's not lying in
the sense that they know they're doing
it
because they might talk themselves into
an alternative truth
and act as if it's true
i don't believe that
i don't believe that
i believe that they're just lying
i believe that they inhabit the
character really really well
to the point where even a professional
would say i think you actually believe
this
in my personal experience
it's just lying they don't believe it
but that's that's just subjective you
know so keep in mind that the experts
and i think i think this is true
that the experts are more likely to
believe
um
that they've come to believe their own
lies it's just personally i'm not
convinced that's all
so
how do you have a trial continue after
the expert has said that the one person
whose testimony will be key to all of
this
is a known
medically
medically
they're liars
medically
from a mental health perspective
one of the two people whose claims are
really the essential part of the case
because it's a lot about their testimony
right it's not just the audio recordings
and things like that you've got to hear
what they say about it
and what one person is saying about it
is coming from somebody who an expert
has labeled as a professional liar
basically
not professional but somebody would be a
continuous
expected to be lying about everything
now i suppose in the trial everybody
who's guilty is lying all the time
but
this is really a different level
this is somebody you can guarantee will
lie about everything all the time
everything all the time everything
important
sometimes unimportant things
yeah because this is the kind of lying
that isn't even related to a benefit
it's just lying to lie it's just lying
all the time for anything
so how do you even have a trial
because there's no expert who said
johnny depp is a liar
by
medical necessity
right keep in mind
that if the expert is right amber heard
can't tell the truth
it's just not even an option
do you understand that
do you understand that if the expert is
right about amber heard
she can't tell the truth it's not one of
her pos it's not a possibility
she doesn't have that feature
it's just a bug there's no feature
there and i don't think that that point
has come across to the jury yet do you
i don't think the jury has heard you
know
this is a person who can't tell the
truth
that's not even an option
that's the way it should be described as
someone who doesn't have the option of
telling the truth
all right
so
here's more
foreshadowing
i told you a while ago that it seemed to
me that the biden administration
had shifted from trying to you know
minimize the damage in ukraine or
something like that
to outright winning
with just outright winning here's more
foreshadowing on that so you cnn has a
report
that the former commander of the u.s
special operations command in europe
uh and he's retired u.s army major
general mike ripass
all right so he's been advising ukraine
for the last six years
and who better right the head of u.s
special operations command in europe
advising ukraine and how to how to
defend themselves
i guess that's the person you'd want to
do it right
but uh
so he says this ukraine is in trouble
because his supply chain is inefficient
no surprise but he says to win the war
uh we'd have to put a lot more effort
into it and we need to stand up uh
five per great five brigades of 40 000
ukrainian soldiers each
to push rush out so 200 000 ukrainian
soldiers to push russia out
which would be
uh double what they have now
i'm not sure what the numbers are but
that's a lot of people
especially in the in the uh
context of an ongoing war i don't know
how you get 200 000 extra people quickly
but
that's a very specific prediction isn't
it
that's pretty specific
because here's what i what i see in this
if it's true
and i would at this point i don't see
any reason to doubt
the opinion of
general rapes i mean like i said he's
exactly the right person to be
talking about this topic
if he says 200 000 people would push
russia out 200 000 soldiers who
obviously would have to be equipped and
resupplied
but doesn't that sound like something
that could be done
am i right
it sounds really hard
like really hard
but i think it's within the realm of
doable isn't it
you don't think you well i'm seeing some
no's on the locals platform why um
do you think that they just wouldn't
have the manpower or wouldn't have the
time or wouldn't be able to supply them
or all of the above
it's possible it's undoable i'll give
you that
but it's it feels so specific
that it's now putting it in the range
of something that we could actually do
right
so have we has anybody ever given us a
specific um invoice for winning the war
this is the first time i've seen it
so
it's not that specific but it's like
it's like somebody who actually knew
what they're talking about and said all
right if you want to win the war here's
the invoice
it's whatever it costs for you know
these five uh brigades of 40 000 each
plus the resupply plus the weapons
it's probably i don't know another 50
billion or something
if you had to guess 50 billion
maybe i don't know something like that
so now there's a price tag on it
what do you think
now of course there are too many wild
cars
putin could go
tactical nuclear anything could happen
but
this is a big change isn't it
when you go from hey
it looks like ukraine is doing better
than we thought
oh wow they've lasted a week
well russia is definitely going to win
but you know they're sure getting the
bloody nose in the process
now it's all the way to ukraine could
win and here's the invoice if you want
to do it your surprise i don't know that
seems like a gigantic change to me and
it also suggests that the biden
administration is thinking in these
terms of actually winning which is what
i told you i was starting to see
by the way has anybody else talked about
this
scott the diocon
for whoever is calling me a neocon
i'm not exactly in favor of war
certainly not with russia
um
yeah the question of whether we need to
stay out of it is a good one and
separate
uh but i think i was the only one who
was saying um based on the language and
by the way this is why hypnotists learn
hypnotists learn to look at the language
not just what it's saying
the choice of words because that gives
you a little foreshadowing sometimes of
what's to come
so anyway to me it looked like we've
changed from
holding them off to winning outright
um
let's talk about the supreme court leak
you know the weird thing about this
story is that people did such a good job
people meeting the pundits
of considering all the angles on this
there's not much left
people did a good job of this
i would say the bottom line is is
clearly politically motivated
the timing is probably not a coincidence
and that it's perfectly timed to
reboot and reset the democrat
messaging which they're doing
so they're going to take it to
um
republicans are evil and they're bad
people and they're going to take away
your rights so that will be the new
technique will it work probably
yeah it probably will work
because this distraction is a good one
it's you know life and death it's an
emotional thing it's babies it's
everything you'd want in a
diversion
so uh it does look like he's probably a
left-leaning person who had a political
motive but also and i'm going to be
generous here
also
i i strongly suspect that whoever leaked
this thought they were making the world
better
i don't believe it was leaked
somebody somebody's saying that i've
changed since
took over twitter
you're wrong
are you just wrong
all right but you everybody sees what
they want to see
all right uh so there's not much more to
say about the supreme court leak
um joy behar has called for a sex strike
if abortion becomes
or if reverse weight gets overturned i
guess she's called for a sex strike
now a lot of people commented wittily
that
she probably could stage a sex strike
and it wouldn't hurt really anybody
but
here's the uh is it ironic you tell me
is this the correct use of the word
irony
that if democrat women decided not to
have sex there wouldn't be any abortions
anyway
am i wrong
so finally joy behar has
brought the world together
unexpectedly you wouldn't see her as the
great unifier but she did because if
there's one thing that democrats and
republicans can completely agree on it's
that democrats shouldn't have sex
am i right
i feel like we finally we found the
middle ground
now democrats are doing it for their own
reasons
you know to
to boycott or you know maybe not to um i
mean they don't want to serve the
patriarchy
don't want to be a slave to the
patriarchy so democrats have lots of
good reasons for going on a sex strike
and i think republicans could get behind
that
it would end it would end
you know abortions as a problem
could end a lot of problems really if
you think about it
if you play the long game
you can solve a lot of problems
all right turns out that elon musk will
not own twitter uh by himself
so there are a number of money
money people like larry ellison and
cutters sovereign wealth fund and
several others add up to about 7 billion
i guess so musk would own the rest but
there would be minority ownership do you
know what that tells me
uh here's that here's what that tells me
that there are a lot of really smart
investors who think that elon musk got a
good deal
that's why they're they're staying in
because otherwise they could just you
know if they already own shares they
could just take their money and leave
but apparently people think that
twitter is a good investment
with elon at the mosque i'm sorry at the
helm
so i think so too
i think musk will add enough to the
product
that
they should do fine i i wouldn't be
surprised if it doubles in a year or two
now i should tell you i do own a twitter
stock but i think it's irrelevant
because if the deal goes through i just
get what i get
saw an interview with grimes
elon musk's ex-girlfriend
and she was
she was saying that she thinks the
universe is waking up
and becoming conscious
and
that we're experiencing we're alive
during the most amazing part of
evolution
that we
grimes is his ex-wife or ex-girlfriend
or is she is she ex or still a
girlfriend
oh i don't know so i don't know what her
current situation is with elon musk but
that's less important
than
the question of
thinking the universe is waking up
because remember elon musk tweeted that
and i wrote a book about it called god's
debris
and
um
are there any coincidences in the world
what are the odds that
grimes and musk
are both talking in terms of the
universe becoming aware
at the same time that musk is buying
twitter which many people including
myself
believe is god's mind
and that god is actually
recombining
as he or she always does
because time is circular
that's what i think but it's interesting
to see
people having the same view i wonder if
this will catch on
all right here's a weird coincidence
that tells you you might be living in a
simulation
people on the political right are
anti-mask
generally speaking
people on the right are anti-mask
and people on the left are
anti-musk
is that weird
we went from anti-mass to anti-musk
seriously
what are the odds of that
and here's what it feels like
it feels as though
the simulation is winking at us and
hinting you know you're waking up
you know you're going to realize your
actual nature in a pretty in
in a minute
hey
watch this
anti-musk anti-mask do you see it
just give you a little coincidence
little hints that what you see is not
natural
that the coincidence is
maybe you're more meaningful maybe it's
a hint
maybe it's code reuse
yes the universe is waking and some of
us are baking
all right
well anyway
simulation is waking up
um
biden has decided to be uh totally
divisive
uh he had his deplorables moment finally
you know hillary clinton called
much of the mag movement deplorables
and now joe biden because he's a brain
dead idiot has decided to so board
division
and i say the maga crowd is the most
extreme political organization that's
existed in american history
really
really
because
i'll bet there have been more extreme
ones than that
i'll bet you i'll bet you there have
been
now now that you know that hillary
clinton
identified a big part of the country as
deplorables
and that uh biden has is now deriding a
big part of the country
does it make you like trump more
because as as uh let's say as
provocative as trump was
he never targeted americans not as a
group he targeted you know individuals
of course
but
uh this is really remarkable that we
could have two two of the biggest
leaders on the left
uh literally say bad things about a big
portion of the country like just
citizens
citizens who just have legitimate
opinions
you don't have to agree with them but
they're pretty legitimate as opinions
um
so once again trump is looking better
the longer he's out of uh out of office
robbie starbuck had a tweet
that i thought captured things well
and this is where i would say
is this a mia culpa
no what is it when you revise your
opinion is that
that's what's going to happen with me
right here in a moment let me read
robbie starbuck's tweet he said what
desantis did to disney
just became a thousand times more
important than many realized at the time
and that would be me i would be one who
didn't realize it at the time he said
here's why if roe is in fact overturned
the left is going to push corporations
to threaten red states over new laws and
the abortion
what desantis did will make companies
think twice
to which i say yeah i agree with that i
agree with that
and when it was happening i thought it
was a smaller deal
than it has turned out to be because
we're not really seeing corporations
weigh in yet are we
a few maybe
but
i do think this was a warning shot
across the bow of corporations to stay
out of the political arena
which i think is good
and it looks like it worked
it's another win for desantis
i mean he's racking him up like it's
just crazy at this point
i actually want to find something to
criticize him for but he's not making it
easy
he's really not making it easy to
criticize him he's he's about the
tightest
politician i've seen in a long time
and by type i mean he just doesn't say
things that are gaffes
he doesn't say the thing that puts him
at risk just just to get attention right
he just does good practical things that
his base likes
and he just sets him up and knocks him
over one after another it's really
impressive
i have to say there are very few
politicians who have impressed me
with just skill
you know i've i've talked about trump
and aoc and i've talked about
other people but desantis really does
have the whole package
there's a big story today how many of
you heard about the big pfizer document
dump a gazillion pages of stuff
and there's hashtags
trending and
people say that the
i'm not saying this but people say other
people who are not me
say that the pfizer documents prove that
they knew that there were all kinds of
problems with the drug
and but people have different ideas of
what is showing
now
why is it not a major story if that's
true
it's not on
fox news
it's not on cnn
it's not anywhere as far as i know it's
not in the left or the right
so what do you think is causing that
do you think it's because
the documents show that there's
something horrible happening here
and uh ordinary people who have read it
and those ordinary people have correctly
interpreted the data
in its full context and it's a smoke and
gun
is that what's happening and then all of
the major networks even fox news is
deciding it's not a story
for what because they're all bought off
by big pharma
is that why
it's possible
yes
you know it's funny i say it like it's a
ridiculous idea which i do intentionally
it's like really
you think that both the left and the
right were bought off by big pharma
to which i say oh yeah that's totally
possible because they are the biggest
advertisers for the left and the right
we know that like we don't have to
research it you just turn it on there's
the commercial
they're the biggest advertisers
so no you can't really you can't trust
the major media entities at all
but
i haven't seen any entity
uh dig into it and make the case that
the the data is showing us there's harm
i haven't seen anybody even try that yet
i've only seen individuals who said they
looked at it
and clearly didn't understand it
and they're pretty
they're pretty sure that they have an
opinion
dr peter mccullough please look what he
said about it well
you're gonna have to give me another
source
i hear what you're saying
i hear what you're saying
but it's gonna have to be a source
that's not one of the rogue doctors
here's what i want
i want a doctor who is not one of the
rogue doctors
to look at it and say holy cow
there's a problem here that i was not
expecting
what i don't want is the people who
predicted it all along to tell you that
it's there if you're believing the
people who predicted it all along
that is unwise
as otherwise because those people don't
have the ability to see it differently
it's a rorschach it's like a rorschach
test so the ones who need it to be the
way they want it are going to see it
that way
dr mccullough needs it to say there's
something wrong he will see that
dr malone probably needs it to say
there's great harm from the vaccine he
will see that
because he needs it
if you don't need it you might not see
it in fact i've seen some pushback
it doesn't seem that the data has
anything scary in it
that an expert would agree with
but if those experts happen to be one of
the rogue doctors who have spoken out
about it
they're the only ones you should not
look to
do you understand that
that in this particular case if you're
trying to see if the pfizer documents
are telling you something scary the
least credible people even if they're
right
even if they're right
so this has nothing to do with who's
right or who's wrong
the least credible people
would be dr mccullough dr malone
anybody anybody who was predicting it
they're the least credible
because with all those documents you can
see anything you want
you need somebody
like uh
i don't know
joe rogan
elon musk somebody
who who you know can see both sides if
they need to
right
um
yeah so i wouldn't believe any of the
famous doctors i would look to
people whose names have not been famous
for having an opinion on it already
yeah i think well well buchan's going to
have a problem coming up too
as you say in the comments
all right so i don't know what to think
of the pfizer document that's uh there's
nobody talking about it that i find
credible
if i ever see anybody credible talking
about those documents i will let you
know
apparently there's a
movement to get
major corporations to not advertise on
twitter
and
now we know who is behind it so
there's a george soros uh clinton and
obama staffers and european governments
are behind it
so there are 26 activist organizations
and ngos
that have all signed some letter um
trying to discourage companies from
advertising on twitter
if if elon musk
ends up owning it
and
and elon musk says interesting
he tweeted this interesting i wonder if
those of funding these organizations are
fully aware of what the organizations
are doing
does that sound like a familiar question
wondering if george soros for example is
aware of what he's funding
that's what i've been asking for years
right i would say do you think he knows
now because i think he doesn't
i think he funds organizations that
generally sound positive to in his
worldview
uh that they do more things than he's
aware of
so i feel like his money is being
misused
but i don't know that's just a
speculation
so moscow is asking the same question he
wonders if the people funding them
actually know how the organizations are
using their money it's a very good
question
and
are you alarmed that there would be some
democrat sort of lead operation
to kill twitter now that twitter is
trying to become a free speech platform
in a way that it had not been before
i
i don't see any coincidences anymore
yeah
all right ladies and gentlemen
have i completed my task of entertaining
you like nobody ever could before by the
way if if you're wearing uh headphones
or ear earbuds
you will feel less lonely when you
listen to this
uh live stream it's true it'll be just
like i'm whispering in your ear
alright is there any topic i missed
today
um
musk using this cloud to make soros make
an official statement has he made a
statement
uh something about trans kids
yeah well
what about trans kids
i'm not sure what angle you're looking
at there i talked about chappelle
um
i i'm not going to read the norm
uh
norm
biography
madison cawthorne all right so
i keep seeing stories that a young guy
was partying and joking around
is that the whole story
oh why do i care about madison
cawthorne's private life
i don't know
uh 2000 mules
so yeah we forgot about that one
so the documentary two thousand mules
which purports to show
uh this is uh uh
dinesh d'souza's film
and it reports to show that uh there was
some ballot stuffing and irregularities
with mail-in ballots
it doesn't prove the case
it simply
attempts to show enough evidence that an
investigation would be warranted
now i guess twitter banned their twitter
account
now i don't know why i didn't see the
reason
but that's pretty bothersome
because
i'm pretty sure it's well documented in
terms of
you know
it's interviews with real people and i
don't think it's made up
so
i don't know why you banned that
did anybody see a reason
scott thinks it's just boys being boys
i don't know what you're talking about
but you're writing in all caps so i'm
gonna get rid of your stupid ass
goodbye
you know one way to get uh
one way to get banned on my channel is
to tell me what i'm thinking in front of
other people
no don't tell me what i'm
thinking
tell me what you're thinking
if there's anything happening in there
because you're really bad at telling me
what i'm thinking you're really bad at
it
oh thank you
uh redubs i appreciate that
um
uh
i've changed
why do you keep saying that
i'm going to hide you from this channel
for saying that i changed
since elon
here's why
again you're reading my mind
i haven't changed
did will chamberlain go too far uh
so i'm seeing all the tweets about will
chablin but i haven't seen the story
about it so i don't know what that's all
about
oh adus
yeah we talked about that yesterday
uh
all right
um that's all i got for now
he has attempted to out the leaker oh
chamberlain tried to out the leaker but
uh
it's not confirmed right a lot of people
were saying there's an individual there
who's got connections to politico
it would make sense that's probably the
person but i think that's that's deeply
unfair at this point
imagine if you're wrong about that
imagine iding the whistleblower
based on just somebody having
connections
and then being wrong about it
i mean that would be really really bad
uh it's not a whistleblower
because it's a leak so it's not a
whistleblower because it's not about
anything bad going on it's just a
regular process oh okay
i guess i'll take that
yeah will chamberlain proposes a
specific leaker i think that's deeply
unfair
don't you
now he could be right or he could be
wrong
but i don't know
if you identify a leaker and it becomes
news
you can't wash that off
i think that would be a lawsuit wouldn't
it
he framed it as speculation but that
doesn't help
framing it as speculation doesn't help
at all
that's a messed up thing to do frankly
now i i blocked will chamberlain a long
time ago
for being a jerk i forget the exact
thing
but
so i guess i'm not surprised by his
behavior if that's true
well just because he's a lawyer
okay
um
yeah he might be a lawyer but i don't
see how you could out a whistle out to a
leaker
and be wrong about it and think you're
gonna get away with that
i suppose if you frame it as speculation
you can get away with it
but that's a messed up thing to do
yeah adam schiff is a lawyer
unfortunately
oh somebody says teaching people how to
improve their lives helps you to replace
having kids do you agree yes i agree
with that yeah more generally speaking
because i do not have biological
children
i do feel and i feel it directly you
know it's not
it's not like a subtle thing i feel a
direct need to help the people who are
here sort of help the tribe
help the country help the town
now i feel that all the time
and i do think that if i had biological
children
my
intentions and my energies would be
shifted to them
so in the sense that your energy has to
go somewhere
uh my positive energy is not going
toward a biological child so it's going
toward other ways so yeah yeah there's
definitely a compensation
thing going on there
um
all right now i'm just catching up on
your comments
you're more apparent to me than my
parents
you know there are a lot of people who
don't have
functional parents
like a lot of people
maybe most i don't know i don't know how
many people have two functional parents
but
uh there is this need for something
that's like a parent that's functional
and i do think the internet dads are
feeling that
filling that hole
um
oh elon gave me a new topic oh if i'm if
i'm different because of elon musk it's
because the topic is more fun
right
um
someone's asking me about christine is
flying i have no idea
unfortunately i'm not the person to ask
on that question anymore
a baseball post oh that was great
yesterday's lifestyle framing for
abortion horrible solemnism
okay i don't know what that means
um
adam schiff has the amber herd disease
somebody just said
i wonder about that because if you
notice that adam schiff tends to blame
people for what he's doing
have you noticed that
that whatever adam schiff is doing
he is publicly blaming somebody else for
doing it that's not doing it what does
that sound like
that's projection
that's literally a
you know that category b
personality disorder thing he acts like
somebody who has that disorder but
i wouldn't say i could diagnose him that
way
all right that's all i've got for now
and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
