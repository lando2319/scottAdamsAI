good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization you
made it again
I know I know you're very consistent and
good for you now if you'd like to take
it up a notch before we have the best
live stream you've ever seen in your
entire life
what do you need to do that well all you
need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker jealous it's not a canteen sugar
plastic vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopa being hit of the
day the thing that makes everything
better is called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens in this awesome mug and
it happens now go
oh yeah yeah
I feel my well hold on
yes my mitochondria is being repaired
and it's just from one step wow
see what happens is the coffee by itself
gives you some benefits but when you
pair the the coffee
with this simultaneous
well whole different level
all right let's talk about some stuff
I saw a tweet from uh Elon Musk with a
little uh icon of a robot and then some
other icon that was too small for me to
look at and I said to my and then he
said soon
I thought to myself he's announcing that
their new Tesla robots are going to be
produced soon
but it turns out that the other little
thing that I didn't recognize was a
tombstone
so what he was really tweeting is that
the bots on Twitter will be destroyed
soon
now it feels to me like there's already
some action there
I don't know if you've noticed that but
I feel there are fewer trolls
on my account now I think I would notice
that earlier than some of you because I
get more troll activity than most but to
me it looks like a better experience
I don't know I don't know if that's just
I don't know could be some other reason
but it looks like they're doing
something different
do you have the same experience
it could be you know completely
you know confirmation bias
yeah we'll talk about uh FDX
but it made me think of the Tesla robots
that are coming in and I was wondering
this
how fast do you think the Tesla robots
will be able to run
if you just said you know run and guess
something
how fast would they be
because if they're fast enough
can I just strap a saddle to my robot
and get rid of my car
can I can I just like ride on the back
of the robot and say robot take me to
Safeway I need some groceries
and they would just start running down
the street with me on the back
why not
well something to look forward to
um
Twitter user resists communism suggested
that Elon should program the robots
so that they can count ballots
um
um
a ballot counting robot
hmm
it can't be any worse than the people
up in Canada I saw a headlined I didn't
look into it but apparently Canada is
looking to allow
uh Mental Health
as one of the bad mental health as one
of the conditions in which people could
request and get doctors suicide doctor
assisted suicide
what do you think about people with
mental health problems being able to
kill themselves legally in Canada good
or bad
good or bad
well so first of all I'm going to make
an assumption
I'm going to make an assumption that
they're not talking about people who
don't know what their situation is
I haven't looked into it but it seems to
me that they would not include people
who were just so out of it that they
didn't know if they
they didn't know anything I doubt
they're talking about that
I'm guessing what they're talking about
is someone who is completely in their
right mind
and they have a depression or
some kind of trauma that they've worked
for decades to get rid of and it's just
a living hell
if somebody is in pain
permanent pain
does it matter if it's psychological or
physical
you know you could argue that either one
of them might have some future cure in
the future
so hold it down there might be a way to
fix it in the future but that that
applies to both physical and
and mental problems right there's always
a reason to wait
but
what about uh now Eugenics is different
that's somebody else deciding to kill
you nobody's talking about that
we're only talking about people who are
in their right mind
making a decision about their own bodily
autonomy
I I think I think I'm open to listening
to the argument but I'm completely on
board with a person who's in the right
mind but they're basically locked in
their own torture head
I think that person needs an option
and it's not up to me to tell them what
they can and cannot do with their own
body
so I'm leaning toward it as long as
they're really careful about not sliding
into Eugenics obviously
um
I saw Jordan Peterson suggest
that Twitter should have effectively two
parts one where you're seeing the
comments and you can interact with the
people who are verified or at least
their identity is known to Twitter
and then a second part of Twitter
that you could call like Twitter hell
where it's all the unverified Bots and
trolls and you know all the sadists and
stuff and you can go there if you want
or you can avoid them easily
and I thought to myself well I'm not
sure you could you know cleanly create
those two groups but suppose you could
if I had the option of only people who
have used their real identity
being sorted to the top of my comments
that's all I need
I I just want the real people to be at
the top
and then as I read down the list I'll
get to Twitter hell you know it might be
20 comments down and then I'll just stop
reading because I don't want to go to
Twitter hell but I might want to I might
want to just see what they said
so I like the option
the other thing I was it was a interview
on Pierce Morgan with Jordan Peterson
pretty interesting and uh Peterson was
referring to a study that women who use
Instagram are the worst kind of women
I'm summarizing in a way he did not I
think the traits were something like you
know the people who used the most hours
on Instagram were narcissists and and
narcissists and sadists and sociopaths
and stuff like that and so the the
thinking is that the average person on
social media who the average person who
uses it a lot right the more you use it
the more likely it's signaling a
personality uh or a character defect
that's pretty deep
so I'm saying the first comment here
shocking
have you ever noticed how many times
Jordan Peterson says something that your
first reaction is my God that is
academically and scientifically
interesting and new information and then
you think about it for like a minute and
you go
away I think we already knew that
yeah because it was kind of obvious
right but it's nice that it's nice to
know that the science backs up what you
think is obvious
um
and also uh Jordan Peterson said
he would prefer a desantis-like
candidate over Trump
you know he said good things about Trump
but said that Trump raises the
temperature too high
it was bad for the Republic
what do you think of that
if you agree that let's say Trump and
DeSantis might have similar Republican
politics
would you prefer the one who does not
raise the temperature to the point where
the temperature itself becomes a problem
independent of the politics
you know it's a tough one because the
reason the reason that Trump raises the
temperature
is because that's what the Democrats do
to him
so should Republicans be denied the
president of their choice
because he is more susceptible to the
other side's dirty tricks
I don't know
yeah you have to make a practical
decision
do you want to be a a moral and ethical
loser or a
you know the opposite
well
um correct me if I'm wrong
but
would you say let's say you imagine the
the subset of prior Trump supporters who
were
also in the public eye
right
so if I were to narrow the conversation
to just people in the public eye people
like me
you know like prominent pundits
how many what percentage of the people
who were Trump supporters and are
prominent pundits what percentage are
still backing him as of today forget
about the public
I'm only talking about the public voices
you know the people are in public
because it's a lot easier to say you
don't back them at the moment isn't it
it's kind of safe to say that
because you know it feels like you're on
the you're on the side of the Angels
I well I don't know the percentage
but it's hard to argue with DeSantis
gives you everything you want without
the bad parts
it's pretty strong argument I don't know
if it's true which is a whole different
topic because you might say well
DeSantis won't push as hard as Trump
would so Trump's still the better choice
Maybe
maybe don't know
but I would note that a lot of people
that you would consider reasonable have
now decided that even if they like Trump
and even if they liked his first term
that things have changed we're in a
different environment he's older
a lot has changed and so it doesn't it's
not the perfect fit anymore now
how would you like
to hear the opposite argument it goes
like this
have you noticed that reality
um this is something they must tweeted
once but I think I'm the first person
who noted it have you noticed that
reality follows the path of most
entertainment
not for the victims because there's
always a victim
but for the Casual observers
reality follows the pattern of you know
most entertainment
for example Trump getting elected the
first time
greatest entertainment
uh what would be the most entertaining
thing that could have happened with the
midterm elections
the most entertaining thing
is a super close election that nobody
expected
I won't say nobody most people didn't
expect
followed by a delayed vote
followed by unexpectedly Democrats do
better than ever before for a midterm
with the the president of their own
party
now that what if you had predicted in
advance okay what's the most
entertaining thing that could happen the
most entertaining thing is neither a
clean win for a democrat or a republican
the most entertaining thing is that
we're going to fight over who really won
by far that's the most entertaining in a
bad way but it will get you the most
clicks and the most energy
all right so that that would have
predicted that totally
um
so I had a point I was working toward
that I've totally lost
what was I talking about
uh
uh expected cheating oh and it happened
okay here we go
what would be the most um
let's say the most entertaining
story arc for Trump as of now the most
entertaining story arc would be what
third act exactly you we just had
Trump's third Act
now he might have more than one third
act because he's he's the comeback like
shocker but at this point aren't all the
smart people saying he's dead
right
the most entertaining outcome
would be
a discovery of fraud in the 2022
election that changed the outcome
followed by
a landslide Victory by Trump
for having been completely
cleared of his accusations about 2020.
now I'm not here let me be very clear I
am not saying that there's any evidence
of uh election fraud I'm not saying that
at all apparently I could say that on on
Twitter if I wanted to but I don't see
any
so I'm I'm not aware of any like obvious
fraud
let's let me be really clear
but wouldn't that make the best story
wouldn't it
I mean there's no contest that would be
the best movie
right so here we get to test the best
movie filter
the best movie filter
is that Trump is down and out and
there's no way he can come back from
apparently being blamed for the midterms
but if
and there's no evidence of this no
evidence whatsoever we're only talking
speculative you know movie Imagination
stuff here
what if they found an actual Smoking Gun
in Arizona
it changes everything
changes everything
now I don't think it will happen
you know I bet against it but that
filter does predict it would you agree
would you agree that that's the most
obviously entertaining outcome
not that it's often not that as likely
just this is the most entertaining okay
so let's let's just keep an eye on that
I'm gonna we'll talk about some other
prediction filters in a bit
um speaking of people who are bailing
out on Trump Candace Owens
had a personal interaction with Trump
that apparently uh she considered rude
that he was rude to her and I guess it
was based on some rumor in
The Daily Beast
that completely quoted around a context
and made it look like she was insulting
Trump when literally she didn't say it
uh and by the way
if Candace says and she did
I didn't say those things and The Daily
Beast says you said those things
you don't have to wonder who to believe
do you
like that that one's a slam dunk right
yeah this definitely can't this there's
no competition The Daily Beast is the
least credible thing you could ever see
um
so do you think that Trump could win
back
Jordan Peterson you know it doesn't
matter he's Canadian but uh Candace
Owens me
do you think he could win back
his base and even the prominent people
who've abandoned him
yeah yeah good totally good
all he has to do all he has to do is be
the best option
that's it it just has to be the best
option and then everybody comes back
there's no mystery to it all could he do
that
totally totally good he could get me
back just by having a reasonable
Fentanyl plan because nobody else is
going to have one do you think anybody
else will say anything serious about
fentanyl nope nope but if Trump does
I'm back and I'm not just back I'm back
full power
right if I come back I'm going to
forgive every other up thing he
ever did because I'm a single issue
voter
right now let me tell you why I'm a
single issue voter it gives me more
power
if my vote you know or my support was
you know spread over lots of issues but
I if I just pick one thing
I can maybe maybe you know have enough
of a wedge to make something happen so
that's why I'm a single issue voter you
don't have to be I'm not I'm not
suggesting that you be one I'm just
saying I'm going to be one gives me more
influence all right
[Applause]
you're all following the story of the
crypto exchange called FDX
that burst on the scene just in 2019.
so I'd miss this entire story you know
until it blew up recently but I'd never
heard of FTX
I didn't know that the creator of it the
founder was worth some tens of billions
of dollars he claimed or on paper or
something
and he was giving massive amounts of
money to Democrats
but here's the yeah he was like 30 years
old right and here's here's the
interesting thing about it
it seems like you always have this
it didn't take long for somebody to find
some smart people who know the crypto
world and they had some video podcast
where the two smart people are saying I
don't understand this whole FTX thing
like there's no way he could be
producing as much cash
to use outside of the exchange with what
the exchange is doing they're basically
people who understood it looked at it
and said this doesn't make sense that
this couldn't possible the math doesn't
work
and sure enough
yeah we don't know the exact story of
what was going on but the math didn't
work it may have been a total total
fraud okay
do you know how many people have asked
me to mention the last name of the
founder
the last name of the founder who created
an exchange which some people would say
in in a crypto kind of a way is sort of
like a bank
you know where you where you put your
money and then you can get it back
it's like a bank it's an exchange
uh and then uh in the end that bank
if you could call it that it sort of got
burned To The Ground by I don't know
fraud or something
and uh the last name of the founder I'm
not making this up
it's a hyphenated name
Bank ban Bank command fried
bank man fried and sure enough
he's a bank man
and he fried
if you tell me that the simulation is
not sending us any any winks I call
 on that I think there's bloody
wings
might be coincidences but it's fun to
think of them as winks
um
one of the big investors in FTX was
BlackRock
BlackRock was one of the investors
so what else is Blackrock invested in
BlackRock where have I heard that name
before
oh yeah
ESG
so BlackRock
the people behind what I would consider
a scam which is all the ESG stuff now
it's a it's a fairly transparent scam in
the sense that I don't think BlackRock
is hiding anything
but you know everything looks legal
but convincing people that you know
these little uh environmentally friendly
companies that have been raided by
somebody
uh are positive it's kind of scam you
looking
for example uh guess what uh FDX the
company was rated as an ESG company
uh and I remind you that one of the
people invested in FTX uh reportedly is
Blackrock and BlackRock is the promoter
of ESG so do you think that they gave a
high score or a low score to the to the
company that they invested in personally
high score
surprise really high score
now
it makes sense that they would have a
high score because if you were a digital
company and they're probably they
weren't I don't think they were heavy on
server Farms or anything like that right
so they weren't burning up a lot of
electricity
so you know according to the ESG rules
that would be a good ESG investment not
a good investment
but it would be strong on ESG but anyway
you see BlackRock as an investor that
should be a red flag
uh there's an ex BlackRock
executive type
who's writing in I think it's the Wall
Street Journal uh Terence Keeley
he was a former BlackRock guy he says
there's a new book that the ESG
investment model is broken
and what he means is that the ESG
Investments don't perform better
than non-asj which is like the reason
people invest
um but also it isn't necessarily causing
anybody to do things better
in other words it's not causing the low
ESG score people to try harder and you
know be compatible with ESG so it seems
like it's not happening there's probably
a lot of green washing where they're
pretending to be compatible but so
apparently the ESG thing just doesn't
work
um
let's talk about uh Tech talk
I told you and I was wrong so I'm
admitting I'm wrong now if you like that
you came to the right place
you like it when I bet I'm wrong don't
you especially when I'm cocky
and then I'm wrong that's the good stuff
so if you'd like to see me be wrong
when I was cocky
here it is
I told you I could destroy ESG and I
don't know maybe I helped it's hard to
know what what impact that that's not
what I'm talking about
I also told you that I was going to
destroy tick tock
because Tick Tock
um sort of their their soft underbelly
was revealed by the election now I'm not
ledging that Tick Tock changed the
election
what I'm alleging is that we saw very
clearly that it could have
if China wanted to change the algorithm
at Tick Tock which they could do
then the biggest group of Voters that
determined the election say the experts
which is young people and especially
young single women mostly The Tick Tock
users if China wanted to influence them
they just tweaked the algorithm and
there it is
there it is
so
here's what I mistakenly thought
I thought once we have this like close
sketchy election
sketchy in the sense that the vote count
was delayed
if you've got a really close sketchy
election and everybody's talking about
what are all the things that might have
affected it this was the perfect time
for everybody to say whoa whoa whoa whoa
we don't know that Tick Tock had any
influence but it's obvious they could
it's obviously good right so why would
you want to keep that situation because
next time they might actually influence
it
it's entirely possible
that yes sketchy why are you asking me
about the word sketchy sketchy in my in
my telling of it just means we didn't
get a quick certain reliable result
that we find credible as as voters
doesn't mean there's anything illegal I
haven't seen any evidence of that
um
but here's why I will not be able to
have any impact on tick tock
and it took me a while to figure this
out because I was noticing a pattern but
I wasn't sure it was a pattern and
here's the pattern
nothing gets done unless there's a
billionaire who wants it to be done
general statement
in politics nothing happens until
there's at least one billionaire
who wants to get that done
tick tock is the only situation where
there are no billionaires who want to
get it done
I'm not because all billionaires have
Chinese business
it would be almost impossible to have
vast resources and not have a China
connection it's almost impossible
so you're not going to get Murdoch
to go anti-china are you
so there goes the Wall Street Journal
there goes you know Fox News there goes
the New York Post
am I wrong
well let me ask you this question do you
think Rupert Murdoch has a business
interests that he needs to make China
happy
I don't know anything about his business
but I assume so
wouldn't you assume so
medium Ogle seems like it yeah
um
so how about Trump
now Trump doesn't seem to have China
business but for whatever reason he's
you know he's uh
yeah he did try to ban Tick Tock so that
that might be the one exception
um who would be the other billionaire
who doesn't have any
any business in China
so here's what you need to know about
the world
uh everybody that you see in public you
know all the politicians and the pundits
they're not the real people
almost all of the important pundits and
the important politicians have at least
one billionaire who is the real power
behind the the throne you you don't
necessarily know who they are the people
behind the curtain know all this
billionaires
so if you name anybody in congress
the people behind the curtain will tell
you they're billionaire you go that's
that guy's guy
all of them
until you see it yourself you you don't
believe it no even Trump had his own
billionaire right remember in Trump in
2016 Mercers right so everybody and that
and Adelson right so if you don't get a
billionaire or two you can't get
anything done
so my
um in order for my persuasion to be
effective in general
I would first have to persuade other
media types and then the other media
types would you know boost it and if the
media said it enough then the
politicians
you know would feel oh that's a that's a
big click item I'll get on that
so that's the way it would normally work
but that process doesn't work because
the major pundits as soon as as soon as
a billionaire who backs them finds out
what they're saying they're going to
stop saying it
so
um here's what I think should happen
I think musk can make Twitter insanely
profitable with just two things one and
he plans to do at least one of these
probably both
one adding payment options so I can
directly pay through through Twitter
you have some kind of digital payment
system I want to pay through Twitter
for anything advertised on Twitter
I mean you do that and you serve me up
advertisements of things I want
I'll give Twitter all kinds of money
because I'm going to be buying that same
stuff anyway might as well give them a
little cut of the you know the
transaction the second thing and musk
asked about this which is uh bringing
back Vines
now Vines was the short video thing that
Twitter had and I don't know if it
wasn't technically up to what it needed
to be but it didn't succeed
but at this point we know for sure that
the most viral social media is video
in his short videos it's tick tock
videos or it's Instagram reels or it's
Facebook videos and it wouldn't be hard
to add a filter on Twitter
so that you can filter out everything
that isn't a short video
imagine that
imagine just hitting hitting one button
and suddenly instead of seeing things
that you are in your feed
you see all the short videos and they're
ranked by popularity
I'm already hooked totally hooked on the
the Instagram videos they're so
addictive it's just crazy
and Twitter could be the same
so at least there would be an American
substitute
there already are you know Snapchat and
and Instagram but I think we can maybe
compete Tick Tock away
maybe might be able to just have a
better product and make it go away on
its own but it would be hard to get kids
to think that Tick Tock wasn't cool
anymore
and to get a kid to think that Twitter
which seems like your grandfather's
service it seems like an older male sort
of thing
um it'd be hard to get teens to go onto
that platform but not impossible If the
product is better
so maybe that's what'll happen
and
you know I can't directly convince
people that like tick tock not to like
it
that that's a hard sell you you can get
people who are unaligned and don't have
an opinion to come down your way but if
somebody loves Tick Tock talking him out
of it
you can't do it you can't convince teens
not to use it that's not even a thing
now here's the biggest risk with Tick
Tock and I've I've taught you about this
before it's it's how magicians work
if you have a big complaint about let's
say topic X
and it's a real valid complaint and you
say my complaint about topic X is this
the best way to make that go away
is to have a second complaint about that
same topic that gets more attention
but the other complaint isn't actually
that important
and that's happening with Tick Tock if I
tell you Tick Tock is a risk what what's
what's the top thing you say it's a risk
because go
Tick Tock is a risk because fill in the
blank what is the risk
well China right but what is China doing
specifically
influence brainwashing
interesting
most of you have been I think informed
by me to know what the real risk is so
so you got most of it right if you look
in the media the media will say the risk
of tick tock is that there have access
to data about Americans
access to data
is that the big problem
no the problem is that they would use
not just that information but they would
they would tweak the algorithm to
persuade people
and if you look at I was just reading a
major article so it's a major article
about the risk of tick tock that never
mentions
the influence it only mentions the data
security element
now if you were to rank those two risks
the risk of data security is important
especially when children are involved
right if you were to give that an
importance I'd say
that's at least an eight out of ten
wouldn't you say
probably an eight out of 10.
what is the level of risk for the
algorithm and using AI to persuade you
that's a weapon of mass destruction
that could bring down an entire country
that's not just even a 10 that's a 25.
that's comparing a a nuclear weapon to a
really good tank
or an HMR system they're not really in
the same class
data security really important really
important but it's not in the same class
with what the algorithm can do
those are really different so every time
you see an article about the data
security part of tick tock
I don't know what's intentional
but it is taking you away from the real
problem it's taking your mind in the
wrong direction to something small
when in fact it's really big
[Applause]
all right
um
let's see
Travis Patton on Twitter asked me if I
could kill Tick Tock from within
uh he says I should join and start
making dance videos
well it's not the most practical idea
but would it be hilarious if all of the
American dads
mostly dads decided to kill Tick Tock by
making it uncool like we we all just
sign up and make dance videos
like we're barbecuing and I'm
barbecuing
and and just like Phil Tick Tock with
with Dad dancing
could you kill it
because you know it's it's not a joke
that kids will run away from anything
parents are using
that's not a joke that's real
I don't know there's probably some level
of uh dad dancing that would make Tick
Tock die
but they would just use the algorithm to
make sure you didn't see it so that
won't work
um
Kyle Becker on Twitter asks this by a
tweet remember the nuclear secrets that
Donald Trump stole and hit at Mar-A-Lago
what uh whatever happened to those
[Laughter]
the the Democrats played uh a very
effective persuasion game
so the January 6th thing was the the
setup so that that was like the canvas
so if they talked enough about January 6
it looked like Trump was you know just a
person who would do like any bad thing
but the January 6th thing the longer it
went on it just felt a little aged it
felt like you know yesterday's news so
they needed something new and fresh that
would remind you of how bad he was
so so suddenly he's got nuclear secrets
that Mar-A-Lago
which we'll never hear about again
you'll probably never hear about it
again
unless he runs for office then you'll
hear about it
but do you think that was ever real
I don't
I don't think that was ever real
I think there there might be nuclear
related documents
would you doubt that
I don't doubt that there are nuclear
related things they might even be marked
as confidential or secret or whatever
they might be
but I bet they're not important
foreign
but they're not important
all right um so here's the big question
should not all of the major media be
reporting the following data to us today
hey public
you should know
that most of the time when an election
is delayed more than let's say a day
most of the time one party usually wins
wouldn't you like to know that
feels like that would be important
do you think anybody will report that
today
it should be the front page of every
paper right
because if you don't know the context
how can you judge today's story
if you tell me hey this story took days
longer than we hoped
well would you like to know the context
so
um my understanding is
people say that it usually goes to the
Democrat when the when the vote is
delayed
but is that by itself evidence of fraud
go
suppose you knew that eight out of ten
times when an election is delayed
uh the Democrat ends up winning is that
evidence of fraud
it is not
because the Democrats prefer the you
know the
the ballot method
which in some cases is not necessary but
in some cases they like to give a little
cushion for counting it so their system
is actually just designed to make sure
that they have time to verify all the
ballots coming
so it would make sense
that where Democrats like ballots
ballots take longer and they don't have
to take longer there's a way to
um you know get around it but in some
places they might want to you know have
low lines and let you vote up to the
last minute just a difference in
preference and that would explain
everything
it would explain to everything
so let me say that as clearly as
possible that one difference
it would explain everything it would
explain why some are late it would
explain why the Democrats usually win
because they have more you know ballot
voting and that gets counted last
so we're all good right
all good
no problem
because the only evidence of a legend
fraud is easily explained by the obvious
really it's quite obvious
well here's my spin on it
suppose you're an engineer do we have
any Engineers here if you're an engineer
identify yourself in the comments I just
want to see how many we have today
 you Jenny in all caps
stupid
get the out of here
oops
unhide
oh there you are you're already hidden
all right uh I see in quite a number of
Engineers
how are you how do you keep doing that
how come I keep hiding you
you keep appearing
all right lots of Engineers this
question is for the engineers only okay
so so just for a moment
I want only the engineers to comment
okay
and I know you all want to comment I'll
let you comment but just for a moment
only engineers
and and here's the question
what uh specifications
do you think the uh the elections had
that were executed in terms of the
system they built what do you think the
specifications were the specs
do you think that the specs were reduced
the uh the lines
maybe do you think the respects were uh
make sure that you have you know maximum
time for checking ballots
here's what I think the specs should
have been
maximum credibility
would you disagree with that as the
specs
no not maximum accuracy nope nope
maximum credibility
not maximum accuracy maximum accuracy
gets you a slow election
right that's that's what they are they
did design it for that
but
the slow election gets you what a a
delayed vote count gets you what
guaranteed every time
it gets you doubt right so if you were
an engineer and you designed a system
that biased design
would give you a days long wait for the
outcome
in a key election uh Battleground
if you designed it so that you knew by
design that it would take days to count
it properly
what are you trying to maximize are you
trying to maximize The credibility
or something else
would that maximize The credibility of
the vote
no
no the longer people have to wait
remember the the public is not
sophisticated
if the public were sophisticated you
could say well these are just different
preferences some some states like low
lines they want uh you know they just
have a different preference and it takes
longer to count
under some schemes than others that's
all it is but the public is not
sophisticated
the public just knows they don't have an
answer and it looks suspicious
how many of you Engineers this is just
for the engineers how many of you
Engineers would have totally known
that that designing the system with a
late outcome when other states are not
late
how many of you had known it would have
reduced The credibility of the of the
result
all of you right 100 of Engineers would
know
that the timing of when you're done is
maybe the biggest factor in credibility
so do you think that they would
intentionally designed a system
for credibility as you know their
highest standard would they design it
that way
Engineers only Engineers only if your
top requirement was credibility would
you ever design it that way
no
all right suppose you say to me Scott
Scott
you know credibility isn't one variable
you know the the time it takes to do the
election is just one variable but what
about all the extra
effort to make sure that the signatures
match
that's that gives you more credibility
right
because you're taking it really slow
you know people are watching you've got
you got people watching taking it real
slow and they're really really going to
be careful about curing all the
signatures make sure you get a real good
vote doesn't that give you more
credibility
no not as much as you lose by being late
again just for the engineers would that
not be obvious to you
just the engineers wouldn't it be
obvious
that that little extra effort of
checking signatures would be sort of
lost to the public but they're
definitely going to notice if you're
late
and especially when the other states are
not right are that late so here here's
my ultimate take
there are no engineers in the world and
Engineers built a system right not no
matter whether politicians said go build
a system whoever said whoever paid for
it an engineer built it engineers
right technical people
so they built a system
that is not optimized for credibility
would you would you agree with me any
system that has a delayed count even for
all the best reasons is not designed for
credibility
what if it's not designed to optimize
credibility
what is it optimizing
is it optimizing convenience
because that's one of the things I say
you don't have to stand in line you
could just drop off your ballot on the
same day no standing in line
well if you optimize for convenience
is that better than optimizing for
credibility
no literally nobody would say that right
how about this Democrats would say no
we're optimizing to get the most votes
we want the most people to be not
disenfranchised you know the the system
is healthier the more participation we
have so we're we're doing everything we
can to make sure every vote counts and
we get everybody into the election
would that give you
um
more credibility because more people
were participating compared to
being late with your result
no it's very clear again that being on
time with your result would Trump
convenience
I won't use trump it would be
convenience
and it would be having extra people vote
does having extra people vote
who are the marginal people who weren't
that interested in voting am I right
the the extra people that you know extra
work brings into the system are the
dumbest ones
they're the yeah the the least
information
the the least caring
they add they add absolutely nothing to
the quality of the decision
so do you think Democrats are trying to
improve the quality of the decision by
bringing in the dumbest people
obviously no obviously no nobody would
design a system trying to get the best
outcome
by bringing in extra of the dumbest
group of people who are paying the least
attention nobody would do that
so I give you this following conclusion
well I cannot say there was any fraud
intended or actual in this election I
have no data that would suggest it
but I can tell you
no engineer would build this system for
any intention other than
hiding fraud
it's designed to hide fraud
it's designed that way
and it's a Battleground state
and they didn't have to and everybody
who says but Scott you don't understand
their system does take longer because
the way they did it
nobody else had to do it that way
right and that that's not an argument at
all because you got all the other states
who are not doing that so they had an
option
they had an option to be credible
and they chose not
am I wrong they had the option to be
credible
and they had time I'm sure they had time
to make adjustments they had an option
they chose not to
what are you supposed to make of that
how else can you interpret that really
from an engineering perspective it's
obvious it's designed for fraud it's
obvious
now let me be clear when I say design
for fraud it doesn't necessarily mean
intentionally
doesn't necessarily mean intentionally
but a design
a design is a decision in a sense right
the design tells you what where your
priorities were whether whether they're
you know conscious or unconscious it's
still going to tell you where your
priorities were and the priority was in
election that's less transparent what
are you supposed to make of that
it's obviously not designed for
credibility
and they could and it's the highest it's
the highest requirement
now the reason they could get away from
away with it is that there aren't that
many engineers
if everyone were an engineer this
couldn't happen
am I right give me a hundred engineers
I will walk in and talk to the
politicians in Arizona
and say I got 100 Engineers here ask
these how to do this right
they'll tell you
yeah they'll have different opinions of
what's right but they'll all agree a
hundred percent of them that the way
they're doing it is not trying to meet
the specification of credibility they
will all agree on that
so it's a it's a lack of
I guess Talent stack that even let you
know allows this situation to happen
so what ratio of uh late and disputed
kinds of Elections go Democrats versus
Republicans I don't know I've heard
people say 80 percent
go one way versus the other and then but
there are some notable exceptions
um for example uh Gore versus bush in
2000.
so very close election
but uh went all the way to the Supreme
Court
and then Gore conceded
so that's an example of
of things going the way of the
Republican
but what state was that that was the
disputed one oh yeah
so in a state man where the election is
managed by Republicans
in the state managed by Republicans the
close election went to a republican how
about that
and you know what happens uh when
um the Press audited the votes
themselves to see if the vote count was
right do you know what happened
well it turns out that the only reason
that bush won
is because there had been a recent
agreement about what types of ballots do
not count
so at the time a ballot that was not
perfect you know let's say it was
missing a date or something would be
tossed out
by today's standard that probably
wouldn't happen in a lot of States a lot
of States would say no it's more
important since it's obvious what the
intention of the voter was like the fact
that they wrote the date wrong
that shouldn't you know take their vote
away if you would use that standard
where it was obvious that it was a real
person trying to make a real vote they
just filled out with something wrong
Gore would have won
do you think in 2022
Gore would have just given up
because the Supreme Court had ruled that
you know they both agreed to those rules
I doubt it like I don't know why you
would do but I would I think there would
be you know infinite clever legal
challenges until they found a way to say
the more important you know they find
some democrat judge who would say the
more important standard is that you
don't disenfranchise these voters
yes both sides agreed to these rules and
yes it's the law of the land in Florida
but
you know some you could imagine some
judge overruling it and say yeah but it
you know the the higher standard
is to make sure that everybody's vote
counts so it doesn't matter what you
agree to doesn't matter what the state
says the higher standard is the vote's
got to count if it's obvious what the
vote was for
uh the 2000 election wasn't slowed down
to count new ballots
yeah there was a different situation for
sure
everything about Gore versus Bush was a
little uh unique I'm not sure if you
could learn anything from that but it is
interesting that Gore would have won but
depending on which ones you accept
um
I said the other day
that the midterm election was the best
case scenario
because the country wanted gridlock
and then they got it
but when I see he you know as this drags
out
the difference between the best case
scenario and the worst case scenario is
really it's really really close because
the worst case scenario is a close
election that looks exactly like it was
fraudulent
that's the worst case scenario and
that's what we got
now I don't see any fraud
but it fits the pattern
we'll talk about that
um
so here are all the reasons that people
are sort of settling on for why the
midterm didn't go the way the
Republicans hoped
um
there's a whole bunch of filters
one filter is as we discussed that
reality always takes the most
entertaining path
that would have that would have largely
predicted Where We Are so that filter
worked now I'm not saying it works in
every case but it worked in this case
yeah here's some other filters
that uh
people like to be given things and they
don't like to have things taken from
them
and I know what you're going to say
before I make this point so just wait
for a moment and I'll agree with your
point before you make it okay
so you're going to immediately disagree
with me but I'm I'm going to confirm
your disagreement in a moment
um
giving beats taking
what did the Democrats offer
we will give you free money to cancel
your student loans
people like stuff free money yay
when the Democrats offer to cut taxes
that's the same thing we'll give you
free money oh yay I like my free money
whereas the Republicans and I know
you're going to disagree but I'll agree
with you in a moment the the Dem what
the Republicans offered was uh less
freedom
that's what they offered we're going to
take your abortion rights as you believe
you have we're going to take them from
you
and then the Democrats cleverly said
they're also going to take your
democracy away
which I laughed at because it was so
ridiculous
but apparently a lot of Democrats
thought they were going to lose their
democracy
and
so that should have predicted the
outcome
now what you're going to say is Scott
Scott you have the giving and taking all
backwards what the Republicans were
doing they were trying to give life to
The Unborn they were giving right
they were giving
so really you're you say that's taking
that's giving that's giving life
it's irrelevant if the voters felt like
they were losing something that's all
that matters and obviously they felt
like they were losing something yeah
young women thought they were losing a
right
that they wanted
so and then the Democracy thing you know
I don't think that the Republicans had a
good counter to that
you know the counter to you're losing
your democracy is no you're not
right and fear for fear persuasion works
really well so if the only thing you did
is look at it and said what feels like
giving
and what it feels like taking you know
forget your academic argument about
who's really doing the giving and who's
really doing the taking that doesn't
matter what matters is how it feels
and this totally felt like the only
things the Republican offered
was less freedom
that's that's what it felt like now if
we've been in the middle of the pandemic
and the Republicans have said we will
free you from the lockdown well that's
good
then then the Republicans are giving you
some Freedom potentially
but the Republicans offered nothing
let's say nothing prominent they do have
plans but nothing prominent about
solutions they just said we're going to
take some things you like we're going to
take them away from you
am I wrong now remember this is how
people receive the message that's not
the message they were sending but that's
how it was received right it was a
contest between I'll take your
versus I'll give you a free that's
not even a contest that you could
predict the winner of that every time
right now you know you've got that
midterms usually go the opposite way of
the president thing but this is as close
to a victory as you could get in the
house without actually a victory
all right here's another uh filter
that as long as the ballot harvesting is
part of the process
Democrats will win every time because
they have a built-in Advantage no not
cheating the built-in Advantage is that
they have urban areas
so it's easier to collect a bunch of
ballots from La Saya you know an
apartment building
than it is to drive down a country road
and say do you have a ballot do you have
a belt so as long as Democrats are
concentrated in cities
they should win every election because
you can ballot Harvest more easily
and so there's a filter
how about that predicted everything
right that could have predicted
literally everything
so that's the filter that would have
worked
here's another filter that would have
worked follow the money
follow the money works right Blake
Masters and I didn't know this at all
but it's this is shocking so Blake
Masters lost if he'd won you know could
have changed the direction of the uh of
the Senate
um he was super underfunded
he had like 12 million or something his
can and his opposition to one at 80
million something in that neighborhood
it wasn't even close
so if you followed the money
it looks like the Democrats put their
money in the right places
and it looks like the Republicans maybe
put their money in the wrong places
so follow the money
would have actually gotten you to where
you are
maybe not as cleanly but it looks like
it would be predictive okay
um
let's see
uh what else
um
and of course there's a trump effect you
know Trump will get blamed because there
were trumpy people running blah blah
um
all right
so I keep tweeting this because I know
it makes people crazy uh not people it
makes my critics crazy
this is just the best thing for
bothering Democrats
all right so here's my tweet and I've
tweeted I think I've tweeted the same
tweet uh three or four times but every
time I do it I get no feedback because
it's just that it's basically a high
ground tweet see The High Ground is the
thing you say that just shuts everybody
up they're like okay there's nothing I
can say about that right so you've got
people in the low ground saying the
election is rigged or it wasn't rigged
that's the low ground that's in the
weeds hey is the fact true or is the
fact not true and then I come along with
this tweet and I I High Ground the the
 out of everybody I go the FTX fraud
on top of the pandemic Fiasco reminds us
to be grateful that our election systems
are the only systems in America that are
not fraudulent despite the incentives
and opportunities to be so
and that's why I accept the results of
the midterm
now
do you think that the critics come in
and criticize me for saying that the
election system is the only one
the only one that worked perfectly
no they don't
they just shut the up
if you want if you want to just shut
somebody down like a Thanksgiving or
Christmas
you do the you do your own version of
that tweet but verbally just say you
know uh I do I do accept the outcome and
I'm just grateful that I live in the
country where although every system that
we have has been proven to be fraudulent
from our finance to our experts to our
medical system to our CDC to our
government
isn't it great that all 50 election
systems
worked perfectly
if you want to see somebody change the
subject
that that leads to instant change of
subject I am not going to talk to you
anymore I'm gonna go eat some turkey
so try that at home it works
um
so Robbie Starbucks
reports on Twitter he said that there
was a columnist in Nevada
who wanted to test the election system
so uh this this columnist got 11 voters
to you know work with him on this little
project and 11 people put his signature
on their ballots
right so very intentionally they that
they didn't try to forge his signature
they put their own signature
on his ballot
and now those ballots were sent in what
percentage of those were caught as the
signature does not match
um they caught
sex
no six were accepted they caught five
they caught fewer than they didn't catch
right so six out of 11 got through with
a completely different signature
and again I'm not talking about somebody
trying to match you know somebody else's
signature I'm talking about a different
name
and six out of 11 get through yeah
now let me ask you this
if you're doing
um election work you're paid by the hour
and your job is just to painstakingly
verify addresses
and you've looked at a thousand in a row
and every one of them matched
you're paid by the hour
you can't really get fired
[Laughter]
not really
what are you gonna do are you going to
put as much attention into the next uh
hundred thousand that you look at or you
get to say to yourself
um
I'm just going to approve all of these
because it's exactly the same pay
what would you do
the average person is just going to
start approving every thing that
comes through because they get paid
exactly the same
that would be the most obvious human
nature thing to do again
if you were an engineer
would you trust people to who are paid
by the hour would you design design a
system where they are incentivized to
lie
am I wrong that that incentivizes them
to lie because there's almost no penalty
if somebody says hey you missed this one
later on they'll say oh damn it I missed
that one did you still pay me yes I did
is it illegal to miss one no it's not
it's just a mistake
all right I'll see you next year
right there's no downside
so of course people would just approve
them without looking of course they
would it's the most it's the most easily
predictive thing
incentives work right any kind of
incentive you put at a system is going
to have some impact it might not
completely change it around but it's
always going to have something back
so anyway
um I accept the election
regardless of these small things because
it was a test we don't know if anybody
actually tried to do anything like that
all right how about this filter for
predicting history repeats
a lot of you believe that right history
repeats so therefore
when you see something forming you can
say oh this is like that other thing
so history would have predicted a red
wave wouldn't it
history would have said you've got an
unpopular president
everything's going wrong and it's a
midterm election with the president of
the other team
it should
it should have been a red wave
history is very clear on this
history could not be more clear on this
this is like one that just guarantees in
fact the experts were only talking about
how big the Red Wave would be
that was sort of the only decision how
big is it didn't happen at all
so history was useless
um
but uh
how about this
how about fraud
suppose your your filter was fraud and
you say all right everything's
fraudulent just everything's fraudulent
what would that have predicted
this exactly what you see
if your filter was everybody is a crook
and everything's fraudulent you would
have perfectly predicted exactly where
we are doesn't mean there's fraud
I'm just saying that if you use it as a
predictor
you would have been right maybe right
for the wrong reason
but the filter would have worked
so how about the uh
persuasion filter
do you think that I could have done a
better job of predicting what would
happen if I'd used the persuasion filter
which I didn't really
well here's what the persuasion filter
would have said
you're only talking to your own team
so whoever scares their team the most
effectively wins
and that was the Democrats so the
persuasion filter did predict that the
Democrats would outperform
what did I predict
I predicted there would not be a red
wave
which is the same as Democrats
outperformed
so the persuasion filter
was right again
several of these different kinds of
filters for predicting got things right
but not necessarily because the filter
was right some you know you could get a
false positive pretty easily but you
should always do a little audit of what
worked and what what didn't
um here's another filter
everything that's complicated
does not go the way everybody predicts
so this is one I don't know if I've ever
talked about this but whenever you have
a complicated situation and elections
have lots of moving Parts very
complicated like it like an economy you
know economy is hard to predict lots of
moving parts that whenever you've got
lots of complexity and moving parts
you could just say that all the experts
are going to be wrong
without any thinking at all just say
what do all the experts say oh all the
experts are looking at this big
complicated situation and they all say
it's going to shift to the right
a really good filter is to say really is
a big complicated situation and
everybody thinks it's going to go right
well I'll predict it goes the opposite
how often would you be right
if you if all you did is just predict
that the experts are wrong how often
would you be right
at least half the time
yeah at least half the time and and I'm
basing that on the fact that scientific
studies they get peer-reviewed and
actually published in the literature
only about half of them are actually
reproducible
right so all the experts agreeing with
something means it's about 50 percent
likely to be true
at best
so if you had done the you know coin
flip I'll just take the contrarian View
you would have been right
you would have been right
yeah a lot of people who took the
contrarian view on covid
will tell you that they got everything
right you know maybe they did maybe they
didn't but
um
how about this filter
I've used this a lot of times and it
never fails that whenever you have a
situation where there's lots of
complexity
so you can't see in all the corners
because it's just too confusing so you
got lots of complexity you got lots of
people involved
and you've got a lot to gain by fraud
and you have the opportunity for the
fraud
what happens in a hundred percent of the
cases where that's the situation
fraud not sometimes every time
why wouldn't it it's a pure incentive
system if you can get away with it
and you know because it's hidden in the
complexity
and there's a huge upside maybe money
maybe power maybe both
and lots of people involved you can
guarantee that some of them are going to
try something you know not all of them
but some of them are going to try it
so that would predict that our elections
are if if they have not been fraudulent
in the past
it kind of predicts that they will be
but it doesn't tell you anything about
the current one
all right Mike Pompeo
um
said
he tweeted uh he said conservatives need
to make the case they're helping Ukraine
defeat Putin is in our interest it will
strengthen our national security to
deterfo and lower costs for Americans
what do you think of that should
conservatives need to make the case the
helping Ukraine defeat Putin is in our
interest
um let me tell you a little story
as a little context and then we're going
to get back to Mike Pompeo
years ago my first job in the in the
adult world was a bank teller
and my boss told me a story about when
he was a bank teller years before that
and one of his first jobs was to be a
bank teller at the drive up window
now if you if you remember drive up
windows at Banks
I think they still have them there would
be like a glass window and there's like
a little thing where you can you know
put money back and forth you know
through the little uh
little uh what would you call it the
little Channel there and uh
and so my boss's boss said all right
there's a good chance that you're going
to get robbed
like you know a criminal will drive up
and and tell you to give all the money
and that criminal might actually have a
gun
which would be typical
and so he was trained that the the glass
window was Bulletproof
and you know they can't get to you so he
was trained to not give the robber the
money
because you're behind a bulletproof
glass and if all if the guy has just a
gun
you know what can he do
so
um sure enough the guy takes the job and
sure enough he gets robbed
and uh car drives up but the guy pulls
out a gun but here's the funny part
uh do you know that the the Dirty Harry
gun
was it a
44 what is it cool 44.
do you know what those look like
a 44 magnum 44 magnum yeah the 44 magnet
is a handgun it's like as big as a
 rifle
it's the most dangerous looking weapon
you've ever seen in your life right and
it can blow a hole through an elephant I
don't know if I could do that but it's
really powerful so the sky drives up to
to my ex-boss who's in the window and he
pulls out this gun that's like this long
and puts it up to the glass
the guy's looking at this this
Cannon pointed at his face they just
start shuffling the money through the
through the channel
take mine everything you want so he just
gives them everything he has right
so so my boss's boss comes to him after
the fact and says
what did you do what did you do I told
you that's a bulletproof glass it's
bulletproof why did you give him the
money
and then my boss said to him
Define Bulletproof
I've been laughing about that for 30
years
Define Bulletproof
foreign
so let's get back to Mike Pompeo
conservatives need to make the case that
uh defeating Putin is in our best
interest
Define
defeating
kind of need that don't you
Define
defeating Putin
you mean as in thwarting his desire to
control territory in Ukraine
or do you mean as in he's out of
business
or dead or
what does that mean
and why would you say in public
something so uh infuriatingly vague and
that that should be like a goal
you should have a a annoyingly vague
goal
that seems like the worst advice ever so
I think conserve as I as I tweeted in
response I think conservatives could
start by defining what defeat Putin
means if you don't have an end game
don't ask us to fund it
which is what's happening I think I'll
give you money for the the thing
whatever it is you're doing over there
whatever it is you're trying to
accomplish now uh Thomas Massey
responding to the Pompeo tweet
I had this take on what a conservative
should be doing sorry so Pompeo says a
conservative should be you know getting
on board to defeat Putin but Thomas
Massey says that taxing Americans
printing money and taking on more debt
to send billions of dollars overseas
with very little oversight is not
conservative
and he says conservatives make the case
that Europe should pay for its own
defense and we should stop meddling in
the Affairs of other countries
now
compare
those two opinions
and you don't even have to take a side
just compare the quality of the opinion
Thomas Massey has a perfectly clear
standard
perfectly clear
the people who are there should take
care of it and we shouldn't battle in
other people's business
now you could agree with it or disagree
with it but it's very clear isn't it
you know you you should assume there are
some exceptions where we would meddle
but in general in general we shouldn't
know I'm not saying that the Massey
approach is right and that Pompeo is
wrong I'm saying that one of them said
something perfectly clear and clean
and something you could actually do
whereas Pompeo said something that would
be a blank check
it's not even close
if you're trying to look for a leader
look for the one who can tell you what
they're thinking and you can understand
it
like start there start with somebody who
says something clear and clean and you
understand it that's a pretty good
starting place
all right
um
I have a feeling that
Thomas Massey's political future is
going to follow a pattern a little bit
like
um Bernie Sanders but the the
non-liberal version of that
and here's what I mean by that
Bernie was you know crazy clown
with his socialism and stuff for decades
right but eventually the world
changed and it became closer to what
he'd been saying for years so he went
from crazy to you know leadership of the
party
or you know one of the leading Lights of
the party
I think Thomas Massey is you know
different enough
from other conservatives
that he's going to be sort of living on
his little island you know his opinions
won't match the the mainstream for a
while
but if we check back in I don't know 15
years if he's still in politics
I feel like the world will be closer to
him
than to other people what would you say
I feel like he's a little ahead of the
world
in the and that's not good or bad
because I'm comparing it to Bernie who
is also ahead of the world but in a
completely opposite way right I feel
like the world is going to catch up with
Thomas Massey
so uh and one of one of Bernie's
strengths
that a lot of people actually admire and
I would be one of them I admire I admire
that Bernie stuck with
you know you stuck with his guns I never
agreed with him but at least he's
consistent you know there's there's not
much
there's very little hypocrisy happening
with Bernie which is one of the people
one of the reasons people appreciated it
and I think Massey's going to be in the
same category you're going to say for
however many years you could say I don't
really agree with that opinion
but it's very consistent it's very clean
it makes sense
and then you might find yourself
embracing it eventually
now Bernie owning three houses is not
you know that's that's not really a
yeah that's such a weak attack because
he lives in a capitalist system and you
know he's okay with people making money
and spending it he's not like against
all capitalism
so you know he's been around for a long
time in a high-end job he has some
houses
it's not the biggest
surprise
all right
um
are you happy to be here again
Wilma Wilma says I made it happy to be
here again
are you happy I don't know
I hope you are
this was the best show you've ever seen
I think we could say that with total
competent confidence
all right
um
uh SNL Chappelle monologue was pulled
off of YouTube now I haven't seen
Chappelle's monologue so he was on SNL
and I saw on social media they did
something that might have angered uh the
Jewish community did that happen
did he fly a little too close to the Sun
there
oh he says Kanye isn't crazy
you know one of the things that um
Chappelle does and Bill Burr does
and I guess some of the other greats
have done it as well see if you have the
same experience if you're watching other
Chappelle or or Bill Burr they'll start
saying something that you say to
yourself
there's no way he's going to survive
this oh you've gone too far oh you can't
say that and then and then he starts
moving this battleship
in a way that you don't think a
battleship could be moved and then by
the time he's done the whole Battleship
has turned around and you say to
yourself
oh okay that worked that wasn't horrible
after all he that was actually clever
and there was a good point to be made
there and there are very few people who
can write that well
so the the thing that both Chappelle and
Bill Burr don't get enough credit for
is there not just writing jokes
right both Burr and Chappelle have a
like a theme
that like an ark that they'll carry
through their routine that's a whole
different level than the joke people
right that's writing that's just good
writing because it'll ask to like tie
together into some kind of comprehensive
whole and Chappelle does that the best
at all like he'll take you on this path
and you think oh I'm over in these woods
and boom you're over here and then
that's the funny part
uh are the loud ums of persuasion
technique
the loud arms who does the loud ums do I
do that are you talking about me
or somebody else
I I don't know what the loud ums refers
to
do I do that
I didn't think I did
all right
Kanye has the word Khan in it that's
funny
now you love the way I say but
yeah I do that to you too don't I I take
you down a path and then show you it's
the wrong path when I get to the end
but it's fun isn't it it's more fun to
uh to not know where you're gonna end up
a little bit of surprise every time I
take you down the path
um
you like the way I say taint
all right so this just has to be
discussed even though it's the last
thing I want to discuss
um
Andrew Tate has beaten social media
am I wrong
I think he I think he went up against it
and beat it
he pretty much owned social media by
being getting banned I I can't get away
from his content
his content is everywhere are you seeing
it or is it just the
is it just being served up to me
but not only is his content everywhere
but he's right on
the zeitgeist
because the things he's talking about
are like other people are talking about
in their own ways so he's he's right on
the reading the room right
so one of the things I
um I try to model
and I think you can confirm this is that
when there's somebody you don't like or
a team that you're against
can you make the argument for them
because if you can make their argument
like without any hesitation
then maybe you're uh you know you're an
objective thinker otherwise you're just
your bias is taken over now as you know
I have a personal beef with with Andrew
daint
so I don't like him
and if he you know if something happened
to him tomorrow I wouldn't care right so
I totally don't like him
but
he is completely successful in beating
social media
he's an energy monster
and he's taking all the negative energy
and turning it into money
and he's doing it really really
effectively
so uh I have to I have to say
as much as I don't think I'll ever like
him as a human being
he is very effective at exactly what
he's telling you he's doing
so he's fun to watch
even though it just bothers me and a lot
of things that he says
and let me ask you this if you watched
entertained how many of the things he
says are things that you've heard from
me first
let me just test that because what I
what I listen to him it just sounds like
he watches my live streams and
repackages them
do you get that sense
so I'm getting I'm getting mixed answers
yeah some people are saying a lot and
yes and some people are saying no
but the people are saying yes are more
likely to have probably seen enough of
my content to know
because you know I've been talking
recently about you know relationships
and marriage and stuff
he's on the he's on the same page
yeah
um
you're saying
his anti-semitism
I don't know I haven't seen any
anti-semitism
have you
and remember so
so I hope I've succeeded in modeling
this so there's a good example somebody
I don't like at all
but I can unambiguously say that he's
really good at his job
Fair
does that does that buy be any
credibility because it's hard for me to
say
it honestly it hurts me but but I'd
rather I'd rather be on the level about
it than to you know mislead you
all right
um I will do the same thing with Trump
which is uh he's bugging me at the
moment
but if he does
you know effective things I'm going to
say that's effective
all right anything I left out
I believe we've covered everything and
we've gone a little bit long which is
just right
just right
and for those of you who watch my
cooking show
um last night I did a live stream from
the man cave which I took into the
kitchen
showed you how to cook in my new air
fryer
and I didn't complete the cooking when I
signed off and somebody asked me how did
my salmon go
that I had marinated and cooked and the
answer is uh completely inedible
I took a few bites and threw it away
I don't know why I may have undercooked
it or I didn't marinate long enough or
it wasn't a good enough
filet or something it didn't taste good
and it wasn't a good texture and I just
tossed it away
so I didn't eat any
protein last night except for a protein
bar in case you wondered all right but
you cannot miss my cooking show
is there anybody who watched it
because I I want to see I want to see if
you recommend it
if you watched it do you recommend it to
the people who didn't watch it
I think the video clip got clipped off
the one that I loaded to locals
I think it got clipped off so I think
the kitchen part isn't even there but
it was there yesterday I checked that
but somebody said it's not there today
all right that's all for now
this has been the best live stream
you've ever seen and goodbye to YouTube
I'll see you tomorrow and Spotify too
