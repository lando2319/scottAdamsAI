me
and welcome to the dose of optimism that
you've been needing
are you finding that
social media and the fake news is
getting you down
yeah yeah you're not alone
but what you need is the simultaneous
sip and coffee with scott adams it is
the antidote to all of your misery and
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker chelsea stein a canteen joker
flask a vessel of any kind
if you fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me for the simultaneous sip
you'll find that it's the dopamine of
the day yes is your chemistry out of
balance
this will fix it
go
do you feel that
i feel that my serotonin has been
replenished although it has nothing to
do with depression
dopamine good oxytocin
still needs a little bit of work
but we'll work on that as we go
because this togetherness which we're
about to experience
will generate your oxytocin
now that would be an interesting
experiment do you think i could change
your oxytocin levels with a live stream
what do you think
could i do it so oxytocin is the one
that makes you feel
basically content and happy and
in love and all that stuff
yeah i think it could a little bit i'll
bet a few tests that you could actually
determine that i could if i tried
so i'll try
uh i'd like your your oxytocin levels to
go up a little
just bit
little bit
believe it or not that'll probably work
for some of you
sometimes a direct suggestion if you
have a big crowd
a direct suggestion we'll get some of
them you know one percent something like
that but one percent just have their
oxytocin levels raised
that's the power of persuasion in large
groups
if i try to
persuade one person of one specific
thing
what are my chances of success
well it depends how much i work on it
right if if you lock him in a room with
me for a year yeah i can convince
anybody of anything
but if you're just like tossing
something out there
you're only going to get one percent of
the people on the first try
you'd have to work on it to get more
than that
so what i tossed out was something like
your oxytocin levels are going to go up
because you're going to feel a
connection and a warmth almost a virtual
hug
in fact
imagine right now you're getting a
virtual hug from me
yeah yeah it's a little gay for some of
you but work with me
and then you'll feel better
your oxytocin level is going up
well the big story of the day is that
josh hawley runs like a did you
see that story
so josh hawley there's a video of him
relevant to the january 6 event
in which he was
let's say jogging briskly to get away
from the
problems
and
a number of people on the democrat side
have decided that they would like to
characterize that as quote
running like a little
running like a little
to which i say
uh paging aoc
isn't that a sexist slur
don't all the democrats who say he was
running like a
kind of need to be canceled
because isn't the entire concept of
running like a
an insult to women
that's the point of it right
that you're you're not a man you're a
woman and that's an insult that you're
acting like a woman
i'm pretty sure women can run
probably a lot of them could run faster
than josh hawley
but i thought it was funny that
for the first time in american history a
member of congress did something quickly
and we're all calling him a
oh
oh you did what you planned to do which
was leave the building in a time of
danger so you plan to do that
but are you saying that you did it
promptly
oh you little
you you little you did something
that everybody should have been doing at
that exact time but you did it promptly
what kind of member of congress are you
for acting promptly
and if i may say one other thing i don't
think this can be missed
what are you doing in congress if you're
still capable of running on both legs
what
i didn't even know you could be a member
of congress if you if you could
get up and run
so
that story is the most important story
in the world why could it be
because the
january 6th narrative completely
collapsed
they got nothing to talk about except
that
josh hawley is still capable of
being mobile
and uh he did something quickly in
congress and i think he should be
expelled for that
well here's some news
apparently do you know that china makes
a telephone equipment switch
which is the most important piece of
equipment in a phone network
right so when you place a call
your call goes to the nearest switch a
big device
and then it goes to where it needs to go
from that device
well
china is one of the biggest
biggest entities in this market and
their company huawei
makes these
these switches that sit atop cell towers
and i don't know have i ever mentioned
that it's risky to do business with
china have i ever mentioned that
anywhere oh yeah i think i have i think
i have yes
and now it turns out that if you put
this chinese high-tech equipment into
your network
uh among the small problems that might
arise are according to the news
especially if they're near u.s military
bases
according to multiple sources familiar
with the matter
the fbi has determined that they could
disrupt
uh national defense communications
including those used by
our command
to control the or oversee the nuclear
weapons
wait what
that's right
we are putting equipment into our
network
that could make us
helpless in a nuclear attack
i think that's that's overstating it we
wouldn't be helpless but
but it's a risk it's a risk that's being
injected into the system
now
i call back to you
and i say to you
does anybody remember
maybe you could give me a year for this
probably it was 2018.
i think it was 2018.
was it 2018 i started telling
you that china was too risky for
business
you know to do business there
and i said that i was going to take
china down
by making sure people understood that if
you brought your business there or you
did business with china and it didn't
work out
you couldn't hide anymore
right if you do business with china
and it doesn't work out for you
don't say you didn't know
because i told you
right
one of the super powers i have is as the
creator of dilbert
if you do something that's going to get
in my crosshairs
you might regret it because i because i
get a lot of attention
you know there are a ton of people in
the corporate world who literally tried
to avoid
doing something that would end up in a
dilbert comic
elon must be the famous example of that
he actually has a rule that says don't
do anything that might end up in a
dilbert comic that's actually the
corporate rule
and there are other companies that have
very similar rules they've told me over
the years
so yeah i can actually put a damper on
on bad ideas in the business world it's
kind of what i do i kill bad ideas in
the business world sort of sort of my
special
it's sort of my special skills
and so one of the ideas of the business
world that needed to be killed
is that doing business with china was a
good risk reward decision
it's not
it's not
so what i did was persuade
people to understand that the risk
was higher than they thought
now was i aided by events
yes i was
the pandemic you know
and all the badness that came out of
that
but you will notice now
you will notice a lot of stories
that have the same flavor to them that
is too dangerous to do business in china
bloomberg actually says that now and
they do a lot of business in china
right one entity does business in china
while the news entity says you know it's
kind of
sketchy to do business in china
so that's happening
and huawei is the latest example
of
of that happening
do you ever see the videos of joe biden
uh going to his helicopter
have you ever noticed he jogs to his
helicopter
has anybody ever seen that he usually
jogs to it
like a
if i can say that
now that it's okay to say that until
this morning i wouldn't have said
something like that because it would
sound sexist
and uh misogynist
but
as of today the democrats have
opened up that word to popular use and
i'd like to say that when joe biden runs
to his helicopter
i don't know to me it looks like he's
running like a little
that's just me
so
interesting thing happened yesterday
interesting thing happened yesterday
so the very video that you said um you
liked yesterday number of people on the
locals network said they enjoyed my live
stream yesterday
the title of which was
that the january 6
narrative had dissolved
and what's interesting is that that
episode alone among my other episodes on
youtube the other hundreds of them on
youtube
it can't be downloaded
i don't know why the other ones can
but that one can't be downloaded
you still see it
but it can't be downloaded what do you
think is up with that
did somebody was somebody able to
download it somebody just said they were
able maybe it got turned back on
but for the last 24 hours you couldn't
download it
so here's a little experiment that i did
i titled my
live stream today with a similarly
provocative title
when i titled something about the
january 6 has been debunked or something
so we'll see if we have the same problem
with this one because of the content
do you think that youtube has somebody
assigned to watch me
like a specific person or do you think
it just goes in the pool like any other
complaint
i think i'm watched
i think the
the larger
probably anybody over 100 000
subscribers
probably has somebody who's assigned to
watch them along with you know a list of
people that they're watching yeah i
think so
so
my effectiveness
is largely determined by a person i
don't know probably just guessing a
person i don't know have never met
who is judging my content and deciding
whether other people should see it
probably one person
don't you think
i doubt it goes to a committee each and
every time it probably goes to the same
person who's got more context and
everything
how is that
how is that okay
don't you think that i should at least
know who that person is i could make my
case
it's pretty creepy isn't it that my free
speech
probably i mean this is an assumption
i'm speculating
probably
is being monitored by one person i've
never met and don't know their name
probably
think about that
so attorney general barr said something
like the cartels maybe we should treat
them more like isis
what's that sound like
we should treat the cartels more like
isis
like a terrorist group
huh
does anybody remember that story where
trump was asking about droning the
cartels
and the mainstream news treated it like
it was crazy talk
was it is this still crazy talk
because attorney general uh barr
who said that the election
you know claims the claims against the
election were
and bar is not exactly
pro-trump
at this moment right
so barr seems to be
somewhat agreeing with the general
characterization
that the cartels are isis-like in some
ways
but that really is indicating a military
attack isn't it
treating them like isis
that means a military attack on mexico
what else could it mean
so
um i think i
might have been
i don't know was i the first person in
the country to say we should send a
missile into mexico like really
seriously
did anybody say it before me i mean it's
a big country so somebody must have but
i didn't hear it
so now we're actually talking about it
seriously
right
did you think it would ever become a
serious conversation that we would drone
or send some missiles into the cartels
in mexico it's now a serious
conversation
not only is it serious but i have the
following predictions
if biden doesn't do it and i don't think
he will
trump will
and when trump does it it's going to be
way more popular than anybody imagined
i mean
there'll be protests and you know big a
big uh
there'll be a big push back
but it's going to be a lot like drone
it's going to be a lot like trump taking
out the top terrorist in iraq
do you remember when uh
trump had him killed the number one
terrorist in iran
and everybody said well you can't do
that he's part of the government he's a
general
you can't just kill a general in iran
well yeah you can yeah sulaimani it's
two of the money
it turns out you can't you could just
kill him
trump did it he just killed him
and it probably helped
hard to say but it probably helped
yes trump could add trump or anybody
else could absolutely um attack mexico
in an act of war
and i got some pushback on that and
here's what the pushback was
you shouldn't you shouldn't
attack other countries
to which i say shouldn't
shouldn't is a word you use when you
don't have reasons
am i right
the word should and shouldn't should be
removed from your vocabulary unless
you're trying to just be a weasel
right the moment you say something
should be done
you're indicating you don't have a
reason
because if it's dangerous you'd say
that's too dangerous
if it's too expensive you'd say that's
too expensive if it's too risky you say
that's too risky but if you say it
shouldn't be done you're basically
signaling you don't have a
reason
right so the pushback i got for
attacking mexico's cartel operations is
that it would be an act of war
to which i said
okay
go on
it's an act of war and now and now give
you a reason
that we shouldn't do it
there wasn't one the reason was it's an
act of war
and you shouldn't you shouldn't attack
your neighboring countries
now shouldn't is not a reason
you need you need a reason
somebody gets hurt you know there's some
long run problem anything
nothing
so just should and shouldn't was the
whole reason there's no reason
we should not declare war on mexico
let me say it clearly if we're going to
send a drone into mexico we should
declare war
we should have that conversation in
congress i don't think the president
should do it without congress
but we should have that conversation in
congress should we declare war on mexico
and i think we should
is that clear enough i'm saying yes
declare war on mexico
yes
declare war on mexico i i don't i don't
want there to be any ambiguity because
when i say we should attack the cartels
it is an act of war
and if you're going to do an act of war
just do it
you know don't be a weasel about it it's
a war
we're in the war we're just losing
let me say it again
the war already stopped started it's
been going on for years we're just
 losing
do you want to keep losing
then just sit there and let your
children die like crazy
right but if you want to win you're
going to have to call it what it is it's
a act of war
and do you think the mexican
government's going to be mad about it
who cares what are they doing
about the cartels nothing they're owned
by the cartels we don't care
do not care
act of war
declare war
clean out the nests
and do what you want you know what the
next uh next objection was
well that's not going to stop the
fentanyl from coming in
what do you think do you think attacking
the cartels would stop the fentanyl from
coming in
no of course not do you think that's the
reason that we shouldn't do it
no
no you're missing the point here does
having a police force make murder
disappear
no it doesn't so we should get rid of
the police right because there's still
murder no it reduces it
right
it's friction you want to put as much
friction as you can on everything that's
bothering you
and i would put all the friction in the
world
on the fentanyl
now you might you might create a
situation where selling fentanyl
specifically
gets too expensive for the cartels
because they're basically a business
right
so you could say all right we're going
to make this one thing too expensive
but if you want to keep sending us
cocaine and marijuana
you know we won't treat that the same
way
but this fentanyl stuff if you do that
your your bases of operation are going
to disappear
that's an act of war
i think we could we could
say what is and what isn't too far
and those who say but scott scott the
real problem is demand
go learn something about addiction
if you think demand can be managed you
don't know anything about the topic
right you don't know what an addiction
is addiction means you can't do anything
about it
it means your brain has been taken over
just because some people can kick an
addiction
that doesn't mean it works
it just means that some people weren't
that addicted and they had the ability
to get the people are super addicted
they don't have any ability to get out
they probably do it if they you know
have the ability and the will to do it
but they don't
so
you can work on the demand side all you
want but it's going to be a five percent
difference
if you bomb the cartels it might be a 10
difference all again not that big
but big enough
big enough to say that we should declare
war on mexico
i don't think anybody's disagreeing with
me right
i didn't see any disagreement here
are you all on board with
declaring war in mexico
okay there is there is some disagreement
all right
i will note there is disagreement
and do you have any reasons
uh
it's the mexican people's fault it's the
cartel's fault
if you're saying that innocent uh
mexican people would be killed you're
right
you're right
but that's the cost-benefit analysis
bomb the traffickers yeah i mean we
would only bomb the traffickers
smaller border
so you think there'd be more terrorism
you think there'd be more terrorism than
a hundred thousand people killed every
year for fentanyl
how mu
if there is
if we if we declare war on mexico and it
increases the number of people dying in
this country we should increase the war
until it stops
i'm pretty sure we can pacify mexico
i feel like that's doable
all right
uh things you need to believe to be a
democrat
um i will i will uh refer you to i
retweeted this so you can find it in my
feed but uh ryan vertanen did a sub
stack in which he explains some of the
weird things you'd have to believe to be
a to be a democrat it's worth reading
all right
um
i'm going to say that it's just the fact
that the january 6 insurrection hoax has
been
debunked it's been debunked because the
hearings have gone to a fairly mature
area already and if there was any
evidence to support the insurrection
claim
we would have seen them by now
and so i got into a little twitter
debate with somebody who is my god scott
have you not watched the hearings it's
just full of evidence
to which i said
really i haven't watched the hearings
but you would think that if it's full of
evidence that would be in the news
i read the news
and the news doesn't have any evidence
the new so i said
so i asked and by the way this is good
technique
i knew that he would have several
reasons
so i said give me your best evidence
your best evidence that you've got in
the hearings
that there was a planned insurrection
here was the best evidence
that trump wanted the magnum meters
turned off
that were checking for guns because he
said quote
they're not here to hurt me
and that was evidence that what he
really meant is they should take their
guns to the capitol and overthrow the
country
seriously
that was his best evidence that was
number one
number one is that words don't mean what
they mean
you see the pattern yet when trump says
find some votes in the context of asking
for an audit
that that really is mafia talk
find the votes it means just invent them
and fraud you know
do something fraudulent
i don't think so
i think find was exactly what the word
means do an audit and find things that
you've not already found that are really
there
why can't words actually mean what they
we what they mean
is trump the only person in the world
who uses vocabulary in a different way
but when trump says they're not here to
hurt me
and then he goes on and
encourages people to protest peacefully
peacefully
what possible
interpretation could there be
except that he was he said there's no
danger from the guns to him
meaning he was thinking about his own
danger as the purpose of those
magnometers he wasn't thinking about the
capital
there's no evidence that he was thinking
oh take your guns to the capitol
there's no evidence of that there's only
evidence that he thought he wasn't in
danger and that was the reason for the
magnometers magnets right the stated
reasons for those metal detectors
primarily
was to keep people who were attending
and the president safe right
and once he said but we are safe
that was the right answer but we are
safe republicans aren't going to shoot
each other or shoot me and he was right
now there was danger at the capitol
that's a different cope
all the democrats have left when all
when all of their theories have been uh
debunked is one word
cope
try to deal with the fact what what that
your entire hearings just fell apart
it just dissolved in sunlight
they put the hearings in the sunlight
and there was nothing there it just
dissolved
now here's the cry more
cope
so we now know exactly how the democrats
do their hoaxes and you can see the
pattern form again because it's the same
pattern as
russia collusion so here's the pattern
a gigantic claim so big that you can't
even believe it
that the president of the united states
or somebody running for it was colluding
with russia
that's a big claim right it's as big as
saying that the president was running an
insurrection on january 6. like big big
claims so number one is big claim
step two
insist that there's plenty of proof
but you haven't seen it yet oh you will
see it but when you do
wow
right so that's step two that happened
in both cases
and it was adam's shift both get both
times right oh we got plenty of proof
then when they go to show their proof
you see it doesn't exist
so that's what that happened with the
russia collusion
and now it's happening with january 6.
they showed their work and there's
nothing there
what did they do
oh i guess we were wrong about this
nope
they shift to their message
to russia interference in the case of
collusion
and then if you're a democrat who isn't
watching the news too carefully or
actually i take that back even if you're
a democrat who's watching the news
carefully
what do you say when a republican says
but that russia collusion thing was
debunked what did they always say
no it wasn't
no it wasn't because the russians were
known to interfere with the elections
right
they changed the topic
but act like it was the same topic
no russia collusion
was totally debunked
russian interference
is a fact we all agree on because we saw
the troll farm and we saw the the memes
but how many people who know about
russia interfering
know that some of the memes were
anti-hillary clinton and some were
anti-trump more of them were anti
more of them were anti-trump
anyway but anyway there was a mix i
think i had that backwards but there was
a mix
the same troll farm that was supposed to
be interfering with the election
i guess they were because they sent out
some memes
spent a hundred thousand dollars which
is basically nothing
and the memes were all weak and nobody
none of them became viral
so the democrats have the same technique
they they hear there's this big claim
uh they hear there's evidence that
hasn't been shown
and then once they're so sure it must be
true because there's all this evidence
that hasn't been shown
then when the democrats have to show
their evidence it's not there none of it
zero
and then they shift the argument to
something that's sort of in the same
conversation or domain but not really
so shifting it from collusion to
interference
so that they can claim collusion still
happened
now proving interference
has nothing to do with collusion
but they sold it
and and i took when i talked to my
democrat friend that i always mentioned
my democrat friend who i learned what
democrats are thinking very smart very
well informed
actually believes that the russia
collusion thing was essentially proven
because the russia interference was
proven
also proven to be trivial
and having no impact whatsoever as far
as we know
and then the the separately there's the
hacking thing but i don't know we don't
even know who did that
our government tells us that russia
definitely absolutely definitely was the
hacker for was it
uh
the dnc hack
would you believe anything that our
intelligence services tells you about
the source of a hack
big no
big no
so
would you say that we have evidence or
even proof that russia hacked the
elections
i would say the only evidence that you
and i have
comes from the least credible source
which is our own intelligence agencies
you know they're not supposed to tell
the truth right
it's not even their job
nobody wants the intelligence agencies
telling the truth
do they they wouldn't be very good at
their job if they told the truth
so now
some deception is part of the part of
what they do so i don't think you could
have a less credible
source than our intelligence agencies
you all agree with that right that's the
lowest level of credibility in this
country
and that's that's the only source
so i would say if you had to bet whether
russia was the source of the election i
would actually bet against it
maybe 60 40 situation
i'm not going to
i wouldn't i wouldn't say i know russia
didn't do the hack i can't know that
but the only source we have that they
did it is literally the least credible
source in the united states intelligence
agencies
so put that in your pipe and smoke it
so now let's take this to the uh january
6 narrative the original claim is that
there was a planned insurrection and
trump was part of it
and then they show us evidence that don
jr had no idea that there was a planned
insurrection
they should have stopped it right there
to me that's just funny
right it's not even like a good point
it's just kind of funny
like really
and have you tried this test yet try to
get a democrat to answer the question
how do you explain that don jr according
to his text messages how do you explain
that he didn't know there was a planned
insurrection
i just watched their faces when they
asked that well you know a little
curious
do you think there was an insurrection
and don jr didn't get wind of it
not only was he not brought into the
plan but apparently he hadn't even heard
of it
what wasn't
not even the rumor mill
ivanka never heard of it
but yet the democrats by all right so
now that their planned insurrection
narrative has completely dissolved in
sunlight
will they say well you know
we looked and there was nothing there
no
they will morph it just like collusion
became interference
now it's becoming
he should have done more or sooner to
stop it
right they've pivoted to he should have
done more sooner and that's just as bad
because by not doing more and sooner
he shows that really he didn't want to
do something
now
can you think of anything else in the
world any in any domain
that something that's good something
that we'd all agree would be a good
outcome
that was done soon enough
nothing
nothing nothing is done fast if it's
good
if it's good it always takes too long
it always seems like it takes too long
right so when you look at these numbers
you can say oh it took too long
and you'd probably be right
it did take too long
but
isn't that everything
how about a little context
literally everything that's good and
should be done takes too long
takes too long
if you look at it after the fact you
will always say you know you should have
known to do this faster right
so if all they have left is literally
the most generic
criticism of everything
do you know this january 6 hearings
don't you think these should have been
done sooner
and better
yeah
do you know why they should have been
done sooner and better
because every thing should be
done sooner and better every
thing there's nothing good
that you want that shouldn't be done
sooner and better and more right
so that's all they have
all they have is the most generic
complaint
but
will they say all right this is all we
have is our generic complaint should
have been done sooner and more should
have been more
no
they will use the small win that he
should have done it sooner which largely
republicans are also thinking
maybe he should have done more sooner
right that part i'm not even going to
argue
but they're going to use that part they
should have done more sooner
to make their ignorant base
believe that they proved a planned
insurrection
and it will work
it will work how do i know it'll work
because it works every time it's never
not worked
it works every time
all they have to do is make a big claim
say that they have secret evidence and
then it hardens in people's minds and
they believe it's true once once they've
convinced people to believe it's true
then cognitive dissonance and
confirmation bias will kick in
and everything they see after that will
make them think it's been proven
even if the thing happening
is literally debunking it
they will still think that the energy is
proving it
they just see there's something
happening
and i know it's true
so therefore the thing happening must be
you know proving it when in fact the
thing happening is the opposite
now how do you get away with something
that ridiculous
well you have to have the press on your
side
right if the press is on your side you
can sell anything to your own base
so we've gotten to the point where
politics is not about convincing the
other side because that can't be done
it's about
getting your own side pregnant with a
belief that doesn't have evidence
and knowing that they won't change their
mind
so basically bamboozling your own team
is now all of politics
do you remember when it used to be
fooling the other team
am i wrong that that used to be the way
it worked
that you know you could count on your
party maybe being on your side but the
whole thing was trying to convince the
other team
and now they don't even try to convince
the other team there's no effort to
convince a republican of anything
there's only effort to brainwash their
own people
using this technique of the big claim
the no evidence
followed by the small claim that people
conflate with the big claim later
right but the technique works every time
uh yeah it's a form of hypnosis you were
right
should have acted sooner
um
so that's how it all works
now there's a new study
i saw it was on twitter
and it says uh
that basically breaks down what kind of
conspiracy theories
uh the the left believes versus the
right
and you can see a whole bunch of
conspiracy scene theories that are
attributed to the political right
lots and lots of them and then you can
see some that are attributed to the left
so you know just so it's complete
yeah like what
okay you're asking the right question
like what
like what would be an example
would be one example of a
a republican conspiracy theory
well this gentleman who did or whoever
did the study
had on their list the existence of the
elite pedophile pedophile ring
that that would now be considered
according to the study that's a
conspiracy theory
with no evidence
except that it's been proven
did they miss the whole epstein story
isn't the entire epstein story about
underaged
underage girls and
not just epstein but a ring of people in
power
whose names have been not been released
for reasons we don't understand except
that obviously they're in power
right
so
as of today
let me establish in public
i've been a big skeptic of the elite
pedophile ring
never you know i never bought into
pizzagate
i never bought any of it
zero percent credibility in my opinion
until today because once once somebody
says well you forgot about epstein i'm
like
oh yeah i don't really think of him as a
pedophile
because
the age of his let's call them victims
because that's the law
is above the pedophile cut off there's
some other name for that right
it's still illegal still it's still rape
but what's the name of it
there's there's some other name for that
right
uh i'm seeing all kinds of names for it
anyway
so if somebody's above some age let's
say it's 16 i don't know what the age is
then it has some other word not
pedophile
but whatever it is
so yeah so it's still a crime you know
we're not going to minimize it but the
but if you call that pedophilia and i
think the way it's being used by
republicans is they're using it
expansively meaning to include statutory
rape
if you include that then i would say the
advanced pedophile ring is proven
i would say that's just an evidence at
this point
do you agree now anything with people
younger than
whatever epstein was doing
actually he went even younger than 16
didn't he yeah he went 14 didn't he
yeah he went all the way to 14. so i'm
not sure what the what label you put on
that but i'm going to accept
i'm going to accept the
common use of the word in politics which
is underage people
so
i think that's proven so here's the
problem with somebody who tells you i'm
going to do a study of what conspiracies
theories each side believes
somebody has to be the god
somebody has to be the judge of what is
true and what's not otherwise you don't
know what's a conspiracy theory and
what's just a fact
so you can't do this study
this is an undoable study
because it requires
somebody to know what's true
and nobody does
nobody does
let me give you an example of how bad
this is
it's a it's a pretty long list of you
know alleged conspiracy theories
but uh one of the things that's not on
it is the fine people hoax
and the drinking bleach oaks
to which you say oh wait is a conspiracy
theory
the same as a hoax
well in this case it is because the
press and the democrats colluded
to make you think that something that
didn't happen definitely totally
happened right in front of you
if a whole bunch of people coordinate
to sell you something that's not true
that feels like a conspiracy theory to
me
i mean i usually call the hoax
but
i would call that so those are not on
his list
do you know what's on his list
uh i'll have to call up my own twitter
feed here but the point i'm going to
make while i'm looking for it
is that there was a whole bunch of stuff
on that list i'd never heard of
and does it does it feel fair that you
would leave off the drinking bleach oaks
and the fine people hoax
that permeated every part of politics
and literally everybody heard about
do you compare that to a conspiracy
theory that
some republicans have but you've never
even heard of it
you never heard of it how are those in
the same list you gotta await these
things a little bit right
all right so over at locals somebody's
already posted the uh
that bit all right so i called it up so
here here are some of the things
that are called the hoax
democrats infecting trump with covet
i've never heard that
have you ever even heard that
is that like a hoax this i've never
heard it
so it's like number five on the spread
or something
that covet is being spread on purpose
i've never heard that one i mean it's
the type of things people noodle about
but i've never already believe it
how about uh
the fda promotes cancer
that's a right wing
i've never heard that have you ever
heard the right wings say that the fda
promotes cancer
what
how about
government mind control are you kidding
me
government mind control is listed it's
listed as not real
what
have you ever heard of the pledge of
allegiance
the pledge of allegiance is overt
government mind control
that's not even hidden
the pledge of allegiance
the you know the the national anthem
the american flag
that is all
government mind control
that is
a feature it's not it's not even a flaw
how's that how in the world is this some
kind of a conspiracy theory now i know
your mk ultra and you know that you know
there's a belief that there are things
that they're
training us in that we don't know about
but
that's just a fact
everything the government does
has an element of
public you know
thought management
how in the world is that a conspiracy
theory it's just it's
all right how about uh holocaust denial
now that's a real
a real conspiracy theory
what percentage of people on the right
deny the holocaust
if you had to say if you had to guess
what percentage think it didn't happen
at all like none of it happened
yeah one percent so why does that get on
the list why is there a one percent
thing on the list
something about fdr and pearl harbor the
mlk assassination
uh fake moon landings well that was just
fun a lot of people say that but i think
that's just fun actually
the government assassinating
entertainers
have you ever heard that
what conspiracy theory says the
government is assassinating entertainers
like most of you are lean right you
haven't even heard of this
so
when you see a study like this this is
completely fraudulent
completely but i also don't know if they
thought it was real
because you know people are operating in
their bubble they might have thought
this was useful and real and telling us
something
it tells us nothing it just tells us
that
if a rep if a democrat
does a study about people believing the
wrong things it will look completely
different than if a republican did the
same study because they'd both be in the
god position and neither of them could
pull it off
all right
ladies and gentlemen
is there anything that i left down
let me let me tell you a little personal
story
that's just the weirdest things
so yesterday i had an extended
conversation
uh regarding uh
my desire to buy a guitar
so
i plan to get a guitar for myself for
christmas like i like to plan my own
christmas presents to myself
and it's because my drumming's coming
along and i heard that learning the
guitar might be easier yeah i would do
electric guitar
and
so it's not it's not usual that i would
have a conversation about playing an
electric guitar in fact i i don't
remember the last time i did if i ever
have
all right so so i have this extended
conversation about me playing an
electric guitar
then i go to a an event for my oldest
step-daughter
and uh
she's engaged um getting engaged to be
married
whatever it is she's engaged i guess and
so it was just an event and there was a
musical entertainment
there were two guitar players
one of them
looked like me
not only did he look like me but it
looked like me enough that every single
person at the party came up to me and
said
that guitar player looks like you
now
what is going on here
it would be one thing
if i thought he looked like me
because i would you know i was primed to
think of myself in guitars and so when i
looked at him i thought that looks like
me playing the guitar
but everybody else thought it and they
were not primed by the topic they didn't
know i was interested in the guitar
nobody knew it
and there he was it was like the talk of
the event that the guitar player looked
like me and the funny thing was that
during a break
i was staying outside and the guitar
player walks past me on his break and i
i called down to him and i said hey
you're me
he looks at me and he laughs i go you're
me you're me and he just laughed and he
walked away because he could see it too
as soon as he looked at me he was like
yeah i'm you
it was pretty weird
so let me tell you my idea for a startup
which is one of my best ideas ever and
nobody's ever done it so feel free to
steal this you know whoever gets to it
first
there should be an app in which you can
find the people on earth who look the
most like you
you might say why
oh
tell me you wouldn't use that app come
on i don't need a why
i don't need a y if that app existed you
would look for your clones
am i right
tell me
you know all you have to do is like put
in your picture let's say or your your
stats your height and weight
yeah whatever
all use it and you would come up with
this gigantic list of people who are
your height your weight and they kind of
look like you
now what would be useful to do with that
find out what clothes you look good in
for the first time in your life
and know and know it'll look good on you
why
because somebody who looks just like you
is rocking that shirt
so if they just show the shirt that they
wore and say hey this sure feels really
good
do you know how many of this t-shirt i
could have sold
and that's even to people who don't look
like me
but i'll bet you there's a whole bunch
of people who have watched this live
stream
and said to themselves oh my my physical
you know shape is similar to his
i'll bet i'd look good in a t-shirt what
one do you wear
because it looks like it you know it
fits good it sure does it's a fresh
clean tease
now if i had a website
where somebody could look at me in my
t-shirt and say i need a t-shirt
and by the way not all t-shirts are good
i mean it's actually dicey to get a good
just a t-shirt that fits right and
know launders and doesn't wrinkle and
doesn't feel weird and stuff
so
if i had a way to find out
how something looks on another person
that's the only way i would shop
i would get rid of all my other shopping
methods
and i would just say scroll scroll
there's a shirt i want bang
and there's an amazon affiliate link
the person who looks like me gets a few
cents because i use their link to buy it
everybody wins everybody wins
yeah hair is a big part of it you're
right you'd want somebody had similar
hair
all right um
how many of you think i can take out the
january 6 hearings
with my reframe because it would require
other people to accept it and amplify it
and the reframe is that they have that
they have they have debunked their own
claim
and i don't think you need to get into
the details
do you
i think we should just say it's a fact
they debunked the claim
and so they've moved to should a good
thing have been done sooner and better
that's it
should should something that definitely
should have been done
could it have been done sooner and
better yes just like the january six
hearings themselves
by waiting what
how long did they wait for the january
six series a year
a year right
don't you think they should have done
that sooner because a year after people
you know have moved on a little bit
right
so i believe that we're going to test
this
if today's youtube um
live stream
gets demonetized or otherwise or in any
way deboosted
like i suspect the last one did with the
same title or similar title
i'm gonna have some questions
you should also look what happens to my
tweets on the same topic
because i don't know that they're
getting suppressed
but if anything was going to get
suppressed in this world it would be me
saying that the january 6 things have
already debunked the allegations there's
nothing more important than that to
debunk in the whole world right now am i
right
that the mainstream press
should be frantic
to try to protect the narrative which is
all but dissolved at this point
so they're trying to protect something
that's already turned into vapor
but it's still going to work
remember
their their method does not
does not depend on evidence
it does not depend on evidence it
depends on persuasion
and the persuasion worked but they're
going to have to
they're going to have to kneecap be
pretty soon
because i'm going to make too much of a
dent at this topic
oh here's some good news
would you like to hear some good news
did some research yesterday because i
assumed that
this little problem was probably solved
by now it's the problem of doing a
proper split screen interview
live there's lots of ways to do it if
you record it you can just do a zoom
that's easy but to do it live
there were tools that existed but all
had some problems
and i tried all the tools didn't work
but there's one i heard about called
ecam
i haven't tried it yet
but i saw a video that says you somewhat
easily you can do a split screen so
somebody can call in
now
if it's true
if that's true that i can get easily get
a split screen up and running on youtube
uh i know i can do it on instagram but
that's not a platform i'm big on i know
i can do it on facebook but i don't like
to use facebook or anything
so i was waiting for youtube to be able
to do it natively which it still can't
do
which is weird
does anybody know why
google can't figure out how to make
youtube do the main thing that people
want to do with it lately which has more
than one person on the screen
i i don't understand it's got to be
intentional right there must be a reason
that they don't want to do it but it's
available through this third party i'm
told
called the ecamm i would just run it on
my end and then i can invite people
i know i know how people like dave rubin
and
joe rogan do it
and probably tim poole but i don't know
as much about his operation
i think the way they do it is they have
a dedicated engineer
the the one the ones who use the more
complicated approaches yeah like stream
yard and vmix and
wirecaster and obs
all of those have the same problem
there's a delay
so you're you're
you don't see your lips move as you're
watching it it's like yeah it's terrible
so these
yeah the same with uh
well aviva has problems with this
so viva
fry would be an example of
uh something that isn't working as well
as i would want it to work
right because remember i do this
somewhat casually it's the only way i
can do it
so i needed to work on on an easy device
without an engineer but i think we're
there
so here's my
here's my tease
i'm going to test that out in the coming
weeks
and by the time we get to the 2024
election
i should be in shape that i can do them
regularly not in place of this
so it would not be a replacement for the
morning coffee with scott apps it would
be an additional content
and i ask you this you've watched me
long enough
do you think i can't just rip the
universe apart with interviews
because
i can make so much noise you know just
talking like i'm talking now
but what i do won't really be forwarded
beyond you know some audience that you
think might like what i do
but
if i had one of the big name candidates
on
and i'm pretty sure i could get trump
if he ran for office i'm pretty sure i
could get trump to appear on this
uh because
you know trump trump does podcasts
you know he goes where it makes sense to
go and nothing would make more sense
than doing this
but here's the interesting thing
what if i got some democrats on here
i could invite my democrat friend
and then
just trigger them into cognitive
dissonance
and that would be the show
so the show would be not even the debate
because there's nothing to debate in
most cases it's usually just somebody
who's
suffering some some kind of cognitive
dissonance
so what i would do is trigger them into
it
and then let you watch the word salad
come out
and then i'll call it out as it's
happening i'd say all right the next
thing i'm going to say
is so
persuasive that it should produce a word
salad
and then watch it come out
have you seen me do it has anybody seen
me do this on twitter
where i i tell people that their next
response will be word salad
and then it is
now you see that the people at locals
have seen it
i do this live
it's reproducible as often as i want to
do it i mean i can easily trigger
somebody into word salad you've
a number of you've seen me do it
now the other thing you can trigger them
into is changing the topic
which is also a win or calling you a
racist which is also a win
right
you could beat joe rogan what do you
mean
oh you mean in ratings
no i couldn't no i couldn't one of the
things that joe rogan does is he has
higher production values
and that really makes a difference on
youtube and
i i'm noodling about doing that but um
i would have to build a studio to do
that which i'm thinking about doing i do
have a space in my house that is perfect
for a studio but i don't know if i want
to spend time there that's the problem
have you ever considered hiring an
engineer
yes and rejected it
yeah
as soon as you add that second person
everything goes to hell
let let me explain my process for coming
on here you notice that i seem pretty
relaxed
i'm sort of i'm in flow
when i come on here usually unless
there's like a technical problem and
then
i lose my train of thought right i'm
usually in flow when i get on here
imagine me trying to get into flow with
an engineer
pecking me to death
telling me to
you know get
center yourself in the frame sit up move
it back move
can you move the can you change the
microphone
as soon as you add that other person the
whole show is done
and you and you turn into a an automaton
right
and somebody's watching you in person
i've tried to do this a few times with a
witness
like from the man cave or something else
you know i'll have maybe a stepdaughter
will be in the room or something so i've
tried to do this
with somebody there and it doesn't work
like literally if if anybody wouldn't
matter who it was if anybody was sitting
just like right over there
i wouldn't talk the same i'd be somewhat
talking to the person instead of the
screen
but
but
if i had a live audience
like 10 people
then i would speak the same as i do on
here because that would feel the same
and they wouldn't be bothering me they
would they would be part of the act
right they would they would not be
ruining my flow they would probably help
me get into it you know because they
would be reacting and stuff so they
would bring me into flow
so one engineer will take you anaflow
and audience will put you into flow so
you have to be in flow or else you can't
do this
uh
yeah it's sort of like the home gym yeah
the home gym you don't have the energy
because there's there's not other people
there that's true
i think i would be best in front of uh
here's here's what i'd like to do i'd
like to build a studio
that has a small audience
and maybe not even invite people
you know maybe i put out a tweet or
something but just the local people
because i'd probably do it on a like a
main street in one of the two towns in
between two towns but either one of them
had these cute little main streets
with little uh
uh storefronts if i could pick one up
for a reasonable price
uh because i don't want to own it
and then i make it my little studio and
invite people out probably mostly do
remote remote stuff
yeah the garage is too noisy to
it doesn't have temperature control
should do it in the movie theater so the
movie theater i removed
i so i have a home theater situation
here so i removed the home theater
seating it was kind of old anyway
and that's probably what i would turn
into either a music studio when i get my
guitar
or my
podcast studio
but let me ask you this
don't you think there's something better
about the
casual non-professional way i do this
or am i fooling myself am i just fooling
myself because i wanted i don't want to
work hard or something
i feel like there's something that adds
to it
because i've told you often that the way
to consume this is not necessarily to
listen to every word
you put it on when you feel lonely
right
because i've learned that most of the
people who consume this are doing it
alone some of you you know have it with
spouse or friend or something but most
of you are alone
and when you're alone
and you're so alone that you're
listening to podcast content you're
probably lonely
so if i give you the professional
content you're going to feel some kind
of wall between us
but if i talk to you the way i'm talking
to you now
which is almost exactly like i would
talk to you if you were sitting here in
person
right
you could tell that can you if you were
sitting on the other side of the table
and just the two of us
were just drinking coffee
it would be
about 95 just like this it's not that
different
i think you can pick that up right
and by the way do you know how hard this
is
it's not hard to do at the moment
because i do it so much but do you know
how hard it is
to be natural
in front of an audience
oh my god it's hard and you know it
doesn't happen
it doesn't happen quickly
even when i was live streaming in the
beginning you probably remember i mean i
was a little
stiff and it's also hard to fill all the
space
have you noticed that
but you don't want to feel all the space
you need to have some
some gaps a little bit they have to be
strategic
yeah
so somebody's agreeing with me yeah you
sucked
when i originally started live casting i
don't think it could have been worse
i think it was bad on every way that it
could be bad and number one was i had
such you know nasal
nose problems i mean it was just
disgusting
so i didn't think i could get to a
professional level anyway
so i thought i'll just keep it casual
and see what happens
you still have the episode saved
the first one
oh you're asking me no i don't have them
saved
remember how long it took me to get a
decent mic yeah
but you know the the
the secret there was the cheapest one
so the decent mic that i have on the
lavaliers do you know what they cost
17
the microphones that were failing
those are like hundreds of dollars
uh
and as soon as you get to like the
high-end microphones you're already into
you need an engineer
but we all learn together that's true
this has been quite a journey for a lot
of you
you know the thing that makes me
happiest is the number of people
especially on the locals platform
who have completely
improved their life
based on something they picked up
in this process in the live streams or
my books
that
that
is worth living for right you know you
wake up and you say
you ever do this you wake up and you you
can't remember what's the point of being
alive
you ever have that especially before
your coffee
you wake up and you think you know
god i don't think i need to be alive
like
there's nothing about it good
i don't have anything going on today
what's the point of it
for me
the fact that people tell me i've
improved their life in some way
is a reason to wake up
like if you say there's a good chance
you'll improve somebody's life today
that changes your whole day
like oh
wow
i could i could go improve a life today
people are constantly
thinking in terms of
systems or goals and talent stacks all
that i bet you think of talent stacks
even if you don't think of it explicitly
and
what's
that
interview ed calderon
who's ed calderon
you know i do have an ex-president of
mexico follows me on twitter
this feels kind of awkward
when i'm advocating an attack on his
country
but he follows me on twitter i don't
know i guess he likes what i say i can't
remember which one
does anybody know which president
ex-president ex-president of mexico
follows me on twitter
uh i forget which one
it wasn't it wasn't fox now it was not
uh
was it called their own
somebody's saying it's a philippe
calderon that might be that sounds
familiar
i think vicente fox i believe i
interacted with him on twitter once
no it wasn't nieto
did you read about china freezing
savings accounts and using but tanks to
protect
banks i did not read about that
i did not
um
uh your talk about bannon yesterday was
good to hear from me i am banned oh yes
yes people seem to be uh to appreciate
the fact
that
republicans are noticing
that is people who look and act like
they do that are going to jail
and not just look and act in a like a
lifestyle way but specifically on this
topic
specifically on the topic of you know
protesting the results of elections and
that sort of thing
it is people who look and feel like
exactly the people going to jail
and so when i said
that if you beg for it
if if the democrats beg for it and so
far they are
if they beg for it we will
set trump on fire and shove him
completely up their asses
like an angry gerbil
if they beg for it
and they are
like there are a lot of there are a lot
of
people who might back a republican who
would prefer that trump not run
maybe even a majority i don't know
what do you think i don't think it's a
majority i think i think trump actually
has a solid majority who wanted to run
at this
point but let's say there's 40 percent
who would be happier if it were if it
were desantis whatever the number is
might be 25.
but
i don't know that it matters at this
point
if trump wants to run
nothing matters
so if the democrats want trump to win
just keep persecuting people who look
like me
and people who look and feel like bannon
right uh
you you couldn't do a worse persuasion
job
now i think that their plan
their plan to take down trump depended
entirely on succeeding
they actually took a run at the king and
they didn't get him
right it looks like the january 6th
thing is not going to produce any kind
of a charge
so if you take a run at the king
you better make sure you get them
because
if they had not done the january 6 thing
i don't think he could get reelected
now there's a little provocation for you
i'm going to say it again because i
liked it so much
i don't believe trump could get
reelected
except the january 6 committee cleared
him
because if they hadn't if they hadn't
debunked themselves i would have thought
there might be something there and
enough people have said you know
we don't know there might have been
something there
but let's let's not have that trouble
um how what is the uh taking a run at
the king what what is the actual quote
it's something like if you try to kill
the king
you better make sure you succeed
something like that
right but does anybody feel the same
thing does anybody feel that um
the january six things increased
trump's uh odds of reelection
and are you thinking only because i
persuaded you or were you thinking that
before
i feel like they hardened the resistance
now and let me say as clearly as i can
because i think some of you are confused
about who i would or would not endorse
my first choice
is that nobody as old as trump or biden
ever runs for president again
that's my first choice
so the minute you say okay
let's do somebody else because of age
i'm with you
i'm with you because we do have enough
choices right
so it's not as if the republicans have
nobody else to run they have a good
bench
republicans have a pretty good bench
it's just not a problem
you know i'll i'll take a tom cotton
you know i would take a desantis um
ted cruz is interesting
that's somebody that i used to be
more against it had had to do with this
public persona i think
but i've never seen anybody fix his
public persona better than he has
and and he also demonstrates on a
regular basis just how damn smart he is
cruz is really smart
like it would be nice to have somebody
in the office
that you didn't have to worry about
their iq
right
now i happen to think that uh trump is
brilliant
in the ways that he's brilliant
right but that's not necessarily all the
intellectual ways that somebody's
looking for ted cruz is just flat out
brilliant
in a whole bunch of different ways
but
but
he's
there's just something
you know what i mean
there's there's something about him
that that uh either it terrorizes the
left and so it makes him impractical
uh there's something about him
but here's the things i do like about
ted cruz
when he when he makes a mistake
you know like his travel issues and
stuff like that i feel like he owns it
am i wrong i mean maybe i don't know
every situation that's ever happened but
is it true
that when cruz makes some kind of a
gaffe he just owns it
right
now there aren't that many gaffes
but i believe he owns them all
and just says yep yep moving on
you know even the gaff about trump
insulted him and his wife and stuff when
they were running against each other
i love the fact that that doesn't bother
him a bit
you know people are trying to get him
riled up
trump insulted your wife and stuff like
that and and he just like yeah whatever
politics
i i do like the fact that that doesn't
bother him a bit
that to me that's a plus
so
anyway i'm not sure i would agree with
all of his policy declarations as i
wouldn't agree with any of the other
candidates in all of their opinions
but
if you gave me a no trump option
i'd probably take it
i'd probably take it but i don't think
we're going to have that option i think
the realistic choice is going to be
trump
versus somebody who wants you in jail
that's what it's going to feel like i
mean it's not literally true but it's
going to feel like your choice is trump
or somebody who wants people like you in
jail
and that's trump every time
and i wouldn't even be embarrassed about
it
because i think that
there could have been a scenario where
it would just be too embarrassing
to uh
back trump and that scenario would be if
if the january 6 hearings had gone the
way the democrats wanted them to
it would be sort of embarrassing
but they've made it easy they eliminated
the only thing that i had as a big
problem
that the january 6 thing seemed
disqualifying to me
to me it seemed disqualifying
did anybody have that opinion
that the way he acted on january 6 trump
was disqualifying
but then you saw the january 6 stuff and
he said oh
maybe not so disqualified after all
did anybody have that opinion
so no yeses no a mix so we get a mix
yeah
then let me ask you this
no matter how disgusted you are with
trump
let's say you're a republican but you're
disgusted with whatever whatever he did
if he ran against a democrat would you
vote for him
go
it's trump with all of his flaws against
the democrat who do you vote for
it's trump it's just a wall of yeses
yeah
it's easy
because here's the one thing i actually
believe about trump
i think he was fighting for me
me meaning an american citizen
and somebody who supported him
especially
i feel like trump fought for me
didn't win
but i felt like he fought for me
um and uh somebody else was pointing out
that
the first time trump ran
uh he was running on promises
and he was a notorious liar
so it's pretty hard to run on promises
when you're actually famous for
hyperbole
but he won because he's running against
hillary that helped
and but now he doesn't have to use
hyperbole
trump can literally say do you like that
stuff before
well i'll just give you that stuff again
because you saw me do it
you know exactly how i do it
you know what it would take to do it i'm
just going to do that again get you back
where you were
that's the easiest sale of any political
sale i've ever seen
there is no sale better than
did you like what i was doing i'll do
some more of that for you or did you
like what biden did you could keep that
too
it's literally the easiest it'll be the
easiest election
trump could do the biden approach and he
would win
the biden approach to campaigning trump
could go hide in a basement in
2024
and it would guarantee his victory
just because the less he talks the less
they have to make up fake news about him
he could just like put out boring news
releases every day
news release
we should have a secure border just like
keep it plain
he would just walk back into the job
but
would he be trump
see that's the trouble
you you don't you don't hire you know
you don't get a uh
let's say
not not insult somebody accidentally
um
you don't keep a wild animal in your
house
and expect it's not going to bite your
guests
it's sort of you know built into the
wild animal concept
uh and you don't you don't hire trump to
be president
unless you know some of your dishes are
gonna get broken and i'm not talking
about other people's dishes you know
what i mean
like some of your damn dishes are going
to get broken
like you're not going to be a spectator
some of your dishes will get broken too
so
i the one thing i've always said about
trump since the first time he ran
is that he would be an expensive
president
but worth the expense
and i think that was one of my better
you know characterizations he's very
expensive
in the sense that he caused a
reputational hit to me
probably brought my income down by a
third
but
biden's expensive in his own way isn't
he
biden's expense of a different way
by up
trump is expensive because he causes
provocation and division and you know
everything's attenuated when he's in
office it's not free
you know you don't you don't want to
support trump if you want a trouble-free
world he's bringing the trouble
but if you want that trouble to be
directed at the things that you hate
and think need to be changed he's just
the trouble you need
you know he's the trouble you require
for some things
competence is the word you're looking
for
am i
yeah i see people saying it's going to
be trump and desantis for one term i'm
going to debunk that
um
strongly
now you might be right all right nobody
knows the future but here's my thinking
when was the last time somebody had a
vice president
that reasonable people would say you
know i wish you reversed that i wish
that vice president were actually the
president
you don't do that
because it makes the president look weak
because the conversation would turn into
maybe it should be desantis desantis
wouldn't do that why doesn't desantis
talk to trump why isn't why isn't trump
listening to desantis more
no
you cannot have that situation
now forget about trump's personality
which would not allow that to happen
it's just not good politics
you want people to say all right i think
pence could stand in
i think he could
and he could he was very qualified
but he'll be boring and uninteresting
and he's not our first choice that's
exactly what you want you you need pence
all day long
penn's is the uh
let me say it again
i don't think pence gets nearly enough
credit
does anybody agree with me i think pence
proved himself to be a patriot at
the highest level
i i would thank him for his service
more than
anybody anybody yeah he
his character never cracked
think about that
pence's character
never cracked
you could like it or don't like it but
he was pence
he started his pence he ended his pence
and he was
not only that
but the craziest thing he ever did
turned out to be genius
which was not have a a meal with
somebody who wasn't his wife unless the
wife was there
that rule you remember the pence rule
and everybody was like ho ho ho pence
rule
i wouldn't have i would not have a meal
with a woman that was not my wife
in a business setting
i wouldn't do it
sorry
now
there may be at least somebody here
who's once asked me to lunch and i said
no now you know why
all right
and there is i think there's at least
one person watching here who is female
who has asked me to lunch
when i was married
and i said no
i didn't give i didn't give the true
reason because the true reason sounds
you know like it's going to cause an
argument
you're like oh she doesn't have to worry
about me or i'll call her and i'll tell
her it's okay and you know you know so
you don't give a reason
but that was the reason
i wouldn't have a meal alone with a
woman in the context of being married or
engaged
or in a serious relationship i guess
remember when that was controversial
that wasn't long ago
it was not long ago
that that was controversial it's not
controversial at all
the
the metoo movement completely validated
pence completely
he's the most validated guy ever
and now what about pence refusing to do
what trump said you know for the
certification
you could you could disagree with what
he did a lot of you will
but it was high character
would you agree with that
i thought what he did was high character
even if you think he shouldn't have
yeah
to me he put the
system above the the outcome
and when i see a politician put the
integrity of the system
above the outcome i go oh you have my
attention now
can you do that again
because if you can do that more than
once
[Laughter]
i have a new favorite candidate
like somebody somebody who says i'm
going to protect the system even if you
know we're getting a bad result at the
moment the system is more important you
know the constitution all that stuff
right right so i don't think that pence
is my first choice or even you know
first through fifth choice for president
but i think we have to say as a vice
president he was
he was first-rate
so i'm going to give him that
all right
and on that note
i'm going to go and let's see if we can
download this youtube video
and i think this was the best
live stream of the day
bye for now spotify and youtube
