anticipation
well here's some good news
uh congress
avoided the debt ceiling
yeah big news
congress avoided the debt ceiling
how did they do that how did they how
did they make this accomplishment
by failing
that's right we're giving them credit
for creating a an artificial rule
that they then violated
and then made another rule that said
it's okay to violate the artificial rule
that they made and then didn't follow so
they made another rule to say was it
really okay
to violate the artificial rule that
never had a purpose before
and congratulations congress you know
for a while there i was thinking you
were completely worthless
but now that i realize that you've
created a rule
that
you uh
got rid of
well there's progress creating rules and
ignoring them good job congress good job
what is the biggest news on fox news
every saturday morning anybody anybody
what will take a huge part of the real
estate on the fox news
website
every saturday
do you know
same thing every saturday
news about what bill maher said on
friday night
yeah bill maher
somebody got it
why
why is it
that bill maher is like the biggest news
every saturday now the the reason of
course is that he's he's doing the uh
man bites dog thing on a show every day
now
basically he's identified more with the
left of the country
and he's criticizing the left
now quite reasonably quite reasonably
he's criticizing him
um but being a reasonable critic of your
own team makes you national news
and he's he's sort of the only person
doing it it's like you single handedly
trying to save the democrats and they're
not listening
it's like
you know there are some elections coming
up right
just checking
anybody democrats left
you're all you know this is my bill
maher impression without doing an
impression
you're all aware
that there will be maybe
consequences for the way things are
working out so far
how about that border do you think
you're going to win an election
just the way things are
now he didn't say those words i'm making
that up
but he's pointing out the obvious
how the hell do you expect to win an
election
when you're doing all of this stuff
we'll see
uh
dave rubin calls him the airlock with
the democratic party
that's funny
all right uh so
he's sounding the alarm about the border
crisis and obviously
that's
going to be a big problem for the
democrats
well in the least surprising news
category this should be my news my new
category
least surprising news now this is
different
from perpetual news
perpetual news would be like
pope denounces violence
perpetual news
or
it looks like you'll be wearing your
masks longer than we hoped
perpetual news
or
it looks like they're not going to make
a deal on the 3.5 trillion dollar
infrastructure bill again
perpetual news but the other category is
uh predictable news
things that you knew were going to
happen you're just waiting for it
turns out that the new george floyd
statue in new york city got defaced
the george floyd statue was defaced
did anybody see that coming
anybody
yeah everybody
they basically
created an object
that will almost certainly cause more
racial division
want it
you know obviously there's no
similarity between a
civil uh civil war statue and a george
floyd statue right completely different
so i'm not comparing a george floyd
statue
to a civil war statue i would never do
that
but
they do have one thing in common
just one thing
which they make racial division worse
am i wrong
because that thing's going to get
defaced a lot by
you know not nice people
and
i feel like it was a step in the wrong
direction
but we'll find out
did you know that the fentanyl coming
into this country
comes not just from china for providing
the precursors to the mexican cartels
but specifically from wuhan
yeah wuhan the
home of potentially the source of the
chronovirus we think
but also the main source of the fentanyl
that's coming into the united states
killing
oh i don't know 75 80 000 people a year
that might be the total not the fentanyl
portion but it's a big number
um
i don't know when i hear news like this
am i wrong
i'm starting to get a bad feeling about
wuhan
i don't know
just a feeling
uh marisha says just send you a video on
twitter about china developing
race-based biological weapons using
precision meta
oh
well
i i'm not sure i want to say that out
loud because i haven't seen the article
so i don't know the credibility of it
yet
but i'll be taking a look at that
so check your twitter feed
so uh
did you do you remember the case of
jacob blake he was a black man shot by
police
um and
reportedly unarmed
i remember during the
trump administration uh it seemed like
there are way way too many you know one
would be too many but
way too many
black
people being shot by police
who were unarmed and so it was uh it was
reported by jake tapper on cnn and
washington post he was an unarmed black
man
and today we find out that the police
officer
who shot him won't be charged
what
how could you possibly not charged the
police officer who shot an unarmed black
man
answer
he was armed
he was armed
that's the answer
he was never unarmed
he was armed with a knife
and he turned threateningly toward the
police
after having
had you know previous scuffles you know
just within minutes
and so the police officer is not charged
because it was self-defense
now
as others will point out
the news got out
far before the correction
how many people will see the correction
versus how many people saw the the fake
news it's not even close right the
correction never gets attention
relative to the original story
so
um
why is it that during the biden
administration
we're not seeing this huge uptick in
police officers shooting black people
who are unarmed
did it just stop
did it stop happening
now that trump isn't president the
police just said we'll just stop
shooting unarmed people now
well they're fewer police but not that
much fewer
yeah i've got a feeling that uh
you know everything from the black lives
matter protest to antifa to the police
shootings
were always a
um based on real things
in many cases but
i think the media did a good did quite
the job on the public there didn't they
quite the job
propaganda-wise
you know i'm fascinated by the story the
nobel prize stories about the winners i
was reading an article about how some
people found out they won and people
have all kinds of different
reactions to winning the nobel prize
but i'll tell you if i were
the winner of the nobel prize for
literature
the one that you think maybe has the
most subjectivity a subjectivity i
suppose all the science ones in
chemistry and science have a lot of
subjectivity too
but
if you in the literature prize
what does that really mean
right if you win one of the the
scientific oriented ones or the
economics oriented prizes
uh or even the peace prize
you've done something that's probably
pretty important
pretty important
but what if you get the nobel prize in
literature
do you think that the nobel committee
read all the books that year
or
you know previous years because it's not
just for that year
did the nobel committee read all the
books
all the books that were produced
how do they know even what things to
look at to give it a nobel
i'm i would argue that the nobel prize
in literature is just worthless
just completely worthless like the
pulitzer prize
do you know how the pulitzer prize is
decided
there's a committee of people and people
authors and publishers submit work so
it's only the
it's only the work that's submitted
right so it's not all books you have to
submit it so that narrows it down to a
small set
and then the
the people on the committee read read
some of those books
and then they say well here's the best
one
here's the best one
how valuable is that
if you're the winner of that prize
i mean
certainly if i won the nobel prize for
literature i'd be bragging quite a bit
but really
is it is it really that much of an honor
not really not really the the chemistry
one yeah yeah economics absolutely
quite an honor the literature
i don't know
so
i'm not too impressed with that and then
here's the really insulting one
can somebody do a fact check on this
am i wrong
that there was big complaints about
diversity because there were too many
white men
uh winning too many of these prizes
but the
prize for the nobel prize in literature
did that not go to an african man a
black man from africa
i think he did right
how'd you how would you feel about that
how would you feel if you were the
uh tanzanian i think he was from
tanzania how would you feel if you won
the nobel prize in the context of
everybody saying you know we need to
spread these around a little bit better
yeah we need to we need to make sure
we've got some diversity in here
so
how can we add a little diversity
how about the nobel prize in literature
how about that one because it's
subjective we'll just
find a find an african man give him that
prize
now i'm not saying that he didn't write
a terrific book
don't get me wrong
so nothing nothing here should be
interpreted as
you know the
the gentleman who won that prize is
anything but a brilliant writer who
probably deserves all kinds of
recognition
but the point is
you kind of could have given that to a
lot of different people
there probably were some decent books
that got written in the last 10 years
right
so i feel like i'd be
i don't know
almost a little bit insulted
a little bit
privately
you know publicly i'd be bragging my
brains out
but privately
a little bit insulted let me give you an
uh an example oh hold here
can you wait for a second
i'm gonna take off my microphones and be
right back
i want to make a little point and i need
a visual aid hold on this will take
10 me
it's hard to put on your microphones
when people are watching
all right sorry about the terrible audio
[Music]
this
[Music]
is the reuben award so i won this in
1997 the national cartoonist society is
the outstanding cartoonist
of the year
this award goes to the top cartoonist
of the whole year
and in 1997 i won it
and i thought to myself
i
my my dream had come true
as soon as i became a cartoonist i said
to myself
there is no higher honor
this is like the nobel prize
for cartoonists
and finally i won it
do you know how honored i am to have
this prize
not
it's completely worthless
for for years it's all i wanted
well it's not all i wanted i wanted
other things but here's why it's
worthless
uh for a few years in a row uh bill
waterson who did calvin hobbs often
considered the best comic ever created
he would win this award
and then the next year he'd win it again
because he was still better than
everybody
but what about the year after that
well he's still the best
so how do you have an award
um an award event
if all you're going to do is give the
same award
to the same top cartoonist
it would be the same people every year
right
and so
the organization that gives it changed
the rules
and said that you can only win it once
you can only win it once in your career
the top award
so we all get one
because you can only win it once
and they're only
yeah i'm gonna pick a number they're
only
i don't know
20 top cartoonists
right you have 20 that are in that that
upper realm the ones you've heard of how
many of the top 20 are going to win the
top award at cartooning
all of them
every one of them
we're all going to get one because now
it's just a participation award
so
likewise
i once met somebody whose wife was on
the pulitzer prize committee
and until i talked to this gentleman
i wanted to pull a surprise i mean who
wouldn't want that on their permanent
record you want to pull a surprise until
i found out how they give away the
pulitzer prize it's just some people who
read some books that were submitted to
say i like this one
that's it
that's it a random group of people who
have no special qualifications except
that they read books
decided that uh on this little group
this one was a good one
it means nothing
it means absolutely nothing
i suppose it's you know good to be
nominated because that means you're at
least in the running for something
but now it doesn't mean much so as soon
as you win one of these awards it's
becomes amazingly not important to you
personally
other people are still impressed
but once you win one of these types of
things
all the uh
you know all the prestige and the
feeling of accomplishment and stuff
it just sort of dissolves pretty quickly
all right here's something funny uh
apparently there's a
unprecedented or
semi-unprecedented
cold snap
in the where is it
it's happening i think somewhere in the
northern clime
anyway
so
cnn is covering this
record kind of cold snap
and how do they talk about a cold snap
in the context of climate change
yeah it's a little tricky now
because cnn and a lot of the media have
been using this trick uh antarctica
thank you it wasn't yet antarctica it
was
i think i was saying north
but antarctica is that right it was
antarctica they had the record law i
think that's right
but um
here's the thing
you know how the media has been covering
the hurricanes and the other
heat waves and the droughts
they always cover every event as though
it's clear sign
of climate change
oh yeah that hurricane
that's climate change
heat wave
there's your climate change just going
to get worse
um twisters floods climate change
dam climb drought climate change
damn climate change
how about the cold snap
how do they describe the cold snap
do they say oh here's some evidence
against climate change
no they do not here's how they describe
it they put it in context
they say it is important to understand
this is on cnn it is important to
understand weather
is different from climate
uh-ho
oh
now we hear that weather is different
from climate
i guess it applies in this case
they go on
weather is what happens over shorter
periods of time days to months
such as the seven day forecast well
thank you i'm starting to understand
this now climate is what happens over
much longer periods of time such as
several years or even entire generations
thank you for this context cnn
one such example they say is a cold snap
a cold snap
snap
which can happen due to sudden changes
in atmospheric circulation not not
climate change
no
no it's just
yeah this is just like an exception
thing a cold snap
correct me if i'm wrong
but wouldn't it be true that either all
of these things are influenced by
climate change or you're not sure about
any of them
i don't feel like you can pick and
choose these
weather events
you know these anecdotal things now i
get i do get that at this point
it does seem like we're starting to see
the signal as they like to say the
signal for climate change
it seems to be showing up a little bit
in the storm activity and stuff maybe
not completely clear yet
not too long ago it just wasn't there
but now
at least some people are saying they're
starting to see it i'm not quite
convinced
i'm not saying it's not there i'm just
saying i'm not sure the date is there
yet
i see tony heller's name come up
anybody who doesn't know that tony
heller is completely debunked
you probably need to google that
yeah because if you're still following
the tony heller stuff
he was a lot of fun i followed him
closely and dug down as much as i could
but in the end
his his criticisms don't hold up
which is weird
because let me say this about him i
suspect that some of his criticisms tony
heller this is probably true
but
in the totality of things he sort of
would see
would see what he wanted to see
everywhere and then credibility kind of
fell away
so that was awkward for cnn but
i will agree with her point
i i completely agree with the point that
weather events are different from
climate
keep that straight
well in exciting news
lockheer lockheed martin has delivered
uh a flying laser
weapon
now i think it's still sort of a
prototype that got proven on a test here
but it's an airborne high energy laser
and they flight tested on an ac 130j
now apparently we're just within a few
years
of putting it into the field
so it's sort of like you know five years
we're gonna have flying lasers
what can you do with the laser
in a military setting
yeah
uh i mean
star wars is here
we got our we've got our flying lasers
what could go wrong well i imagine we'll
be shooting down a lot of drones with
these flying lasers
a lot of other stuff too
give it to the taliban
yeah five years to develop it
uh and one more year to give it to the
taliban
that's that's probably on the the actual
plan
from
lockheed martin
uh five years to develop
one year to give it to the taliban
i've said this before but the more we
watch it the more interesting it is that
you're seeing lots of criticisms of
trump in the news
no surprise because he's looking at a
run for 2024 and he's still influencing
politics so of course we're talking
about them
but what's interesting is
that nearly all of the criticisms now
are about
what
what are nearly all of the trump
criticisms about
not policies
that they've given up
on criticizing him on policies
why
because biden's not doing so hard on
policy
so they have to find things that are
sort of outside his job description so
it's going to be all about his taxes and
whatever financial things he may or may
not have done and you know whether or
not his business acumen and his private
life is is what he says it is and and
january 6 which
didn't have anything to do with his job
description per se or his policies
so
the i'm seeing
something that borders on desperation
because just imagine
that the entire
media is not attacking him on the stuff
of his job
i mean just
just try to hold that in your head all
of the criticism that trump got about
his job
while he was on the office and the
moment he's out and you have a real
thing to compare him to biden
no more criticism of trump on his job
right now i'm not saying that he did
everything you know free that you you
couldn't criticize him even i've
criticized him
on his job everybody's criticized him
for one thing or another that's the job
of a president
but watching the focus be completely
outside the realm of politics
well it's in politics but outside the
realm of his job description
is really telling
it's almost
uh capitulation
it looks like media capitulation they've
kind of agreed that he had good policies
it just
was stuff about him they don't like
all right
here is just a
sort of uh i guess a mental experiment
so i'm not recommending this i'm going
to talk about an idea
but hear me
hear me clearly no hear me clearly
not clearly
you
you people
stop making jokes about that kind of
stuff hear me clearly
when i say i'm not recommending this
it's interesting to talk about
suppose the government said to you we'll
give you three options and if you
satisfy any one of these three
you'll have something like a vaccine
passport even without the vaccine and
you'll have access to everything in
society
what's your first choice now your first
choice is that you have access to
everything in society and the government
stays out of your business right right
we don't have to we don't have to
disagree on that
first choice
get rid of the mandates
all on the same page you don't need to
tell me that okay all on the same page
but
just to throw out an alternative suppose
you can't get where you want and you
want to you have to settle for something
in between
suppose the government said you could
have full access to everything if you're
vaccinated
or if you have natural immunity and you
can prove it
or i'll throw in that you
did a rapid test within within an hour
or something
so three things but i'm going to throw
in a fourth thing
you can pass a written test
on coven risks
all right so you'd have four ways to
have full access to society
testing often
some some version of rapid testing which
isn't as good as pcr
but would get you pretty close
natural immunity vaccinations or to pass
a written test
now
here's what most of you are thinking
right now
and putting in the comments
scott uh who's evaluating that test
uh scott who comes up with the questions
on that test
uh scott your plan is totally
impractical because of who makes up the
test
right
everybody thinks that right
all agree
it can never work
because you would never trust the people
who come up with a test
okay you're all wrong
you're all wrong watch me change your
mind
in
10 seconds
all right you're all worried that the
subjectivity of who creates the test is
just going to make it a garbage
10 seconds i'm going to change your mind
the test only has to ask
what does the cdc claim is true
you're not asking the person what they
think is true
you're asking them are they aware
what the cdc says is true
now i'm not talking about like exact
numbers but you know a test that gives
you the general idea for example
if it gave you a multiple choice and
said your risk of hospitalization
according to the cdc
according to the cdc what is your risk
of hospitalization if you get the
if you get the uh
coronavirus that's it
we would not be asking people to be
correct we would not ask their opinion
we would simply ask if they're aware of
what the government is telling them
if they say i am totally aware of what
the government is telling them telling
me and i don't believe it
or
it might be true but i don't care
i still don't want to get it
then you're fine
then you're fine you just have to be
informed
i've often said that one of the best
purposes of the government if when they
do it right
is to inform the public
as opposed to forcing the public to do
stuff
don't force us
just make sure we're informed and if a
simple little test it could be 10
questions it's not like it's going to
take you all day right just 10 questions
you pass the 10 questions
you don't need to get vaccinated that's
it
um
now what do you think now now that i
took away your objection to who makes
the test
you're only you're only being tested on
what the government says is true not
what's true
not what's true just what they say is
true
um
another possible test all right
took me 50 seconds well i got to the
main part in ted
cd says a lot of things right you don't
need to believe them
i'm seeing
i'm seeing some people liking the idea i
don't know if it's possible because who
would administer it and
and all that
um but remember remember you found out
that there were so many people who
thought the risk of the vaccination was
completely out of
out of whack
for the actual risk
i think you would have a lot of
republicans answer the the quiz and get
the right answers and say i don't want
to get vaccinated now i told you i have
a very smart
friend
who is completely aware of all the
the risks
and
chooses to
you know just be natural basically and
just not let science touch him as much
as possible
it's a should be a free person's choice
you know i'm not saying i agree with it
but it should be a free person's choice
all right
um let me let me throw in another one
another idea okay and again we all agree
i think most of the people watching
these live streams
probably you're drawn to them because
you know you have some agreement with me
on some stuff
we don't like mandates
but if you can't get rid of them
there might be some negotiation you
could do maybe
here's another one
um
drop the mandates
but also drop the restriction on people
like me trying to convince you
about that one
so i i restrained myself
because i don't think it would be
ethical for me to try to persuade you to
do a medical process
would you say we'll drop all of the
mandates nobody has to get vaccinated
but here's the deal
people like me
would be unleashed
now i don't think i would necessarily
use that power because again
unethical but i would imagine that there
are other people
who might want to just unleash their
persuasion power and then you could do
with it while you walked
you could see it you could avoid it but
you wouldn't have any restrictions
you know
is that fair
would that fair be fair to increase
increase the persuasion but get rid of
the mandate
somebody says they're already unleashed
i'm not so sure i'm not so sure that the
professionals have been maybe
but i haven't i haven't seen anything
that would look like professional work
you know nothing nothing persuading you
that looks like
you know
real consultants on persuasion were
involved it doesn't look like that it
looks like just information
take the desantis approach and focus on
people in the high risk and let
everybody else do what they want yeah i
mean if you could get there that'd be
great
all right
or how about
how about another one here's another
version of the same idea
how about
imagine imagine this
um you this won't happen so just a
budget imagine trump
runs for president and maybe the
vaccination question will be dead by
then let's imagine just some politician
republican saying the following
so when the public 90 of the public can
pass the cdc test
will drop the mandates
so it would be a random poll you you
wouldn't have to take a test
so you personally would never have to
take a test but every once while they
would randomly sample
and give people the test
and say if 90 of the people we randomly
sample pass the test
you're all free
if 90 can pass the test and again it's
not a test of what's right or wrong it's
a test of just what the cdc thinks is
right
do you know it
if you know it
and you still choose to be unvaccinated
the country has spoken
how about that one
who is doing the sampling why would we
trust them well you could just release a
number of different polling entities you
could say quinipec you know you do it
rasmussen you do it
get a couple of other polls and you know
if all three of them say we got a 92 to
95 percent
correct rate
that'd be close enough
it doesn't have to be exact
the left would purposely get it wrong
i don't know
i wouldn't worry too much about that
is dilbert made in china with forced
labor probably
all the gotcha people don't understand
why that's not really a gotcha but i'm
too bored to explain it again
but yes
i buy chinese products chinese-made
products and there are some dilbert
products
manufactured in china yes that's a fact
it's not a gotcha
that is a public fact
and do i like it nope don't like it at
all is it practical to change it
overnight nope
but changing could gradually make sense
all right did you see the
kamla harris cringy video how many of
you saw it
there's a kamala harris
video going around in which she's
talking to some it looks like young
girls
maybe high school
or
i'm not sure what age is there
but um
they're involved in some kind of space
camp or some space related program
to learn things and she's talking to
them and i would like to give you my
impression
if you haven't seen it
my impression of kamala harris
talking to young people
in her totally natural way which we all
feel so comfortable with
i've explained her style as i cross
between
the harry potter gollum
oh
you know the golem and harry potter
um
but but in this case the golem is on
mdma
ecstasy and is inexplicably happy
still the
golem but
weirdly optimistic you know the golem
seems more like a pessimist
but he's taken some drugs
and now he's an optimist this is kamli
harris and i'll use some of her own
words
i just love the idea
of exploring
the unknown
to think
to to think about
so much is out there
that's why i'm so i'm so
we're going to learn so much we're going
to learn so much
as we are curious
and interested in the potential for
discoveries
you guys are literally going to see
creators creators on the moon with your
own eyes
all of you with your own eyes you can
see craters on the moon
and there are other things we haven't
figured out and discovered and
fascinating things and you'll find them
all out
and
scene
now i don't know if that's my best work
but
i spent
a solid five minutes working on that
impression and i hope that my hard work
is appreciated
a lot of people will do a live stream
will they have a prepared
act for you no no they'll just jump
right into it not me i prepare
i like to give you the full experience
all right um that
explains why kamala harris you're not
seeing her so much in public
how would you like to be the geniuses
who
were behind biden
with the understanding that maybe kamala
harris would be that capable person who
would take over if if he failed
i feel like the old spare tires got a
flat if you know what i mean you know
what i mean calmly harris the spare tire
spare tire is a little low on air you
know what i mean i think you know what i
mean
you got a spare tire problem
you might need a spare tire for the
spare tire
oh but at least
you know if if the spare tire doesn't
work you've got nancy pelo
uh
you need a spare tire in the spare tire
and the spare tire is what you need
that's what you need
all right is there anything else
happening oh the most exciting story
turns out that there's a
tick tock influencer
somebody who's got a pretty big
following on tick tock
whose name is tally dilbert
that's right her last name is dilbert
do i feel sorry for her
i'd like to apologize publicly to all
the people i think i think the people in
the
is it the bahamas
there's some place where the last name
dilbert is fairly common
i think it's the bahamas
or somewhere in that general part of the
world
and uh i just feel bad for anybody who
has that name
i feel like i ruined it
do you ever worry that somebody will
ruin your name
i have a a common name so
you know i saw my google alerts just to
catch anything that somebody's saying
about me in the media and i pick up a
lot of scott adams news
about people named scott adams who are
not me
it turns out a ton of us
us me being people named scott adams are
police officers and lawyers
there's just a ton of people with my
name police officers and lawyers i don't
know what's going on with that maybe
that's the only people who are in the
news so it's a the sample is skewed
but
i worry
that it'll be somebody with my exact
name because there are so many of us i
think there are four of me in this town
you know right where i live i think
there are four or five scott adams's
and
i met a few
one is black
he lives locally
um
so there's just all kinds of scott
adams's
and
oh honduras thank you yes tally dilbert
i believe she's a honduran
you're correct yeah so honduran and als
but i also think the bahamas have that
last
name um
now there's some guy with you let with
your name who writes bad checks on a
regular basis that sucks so i'm worried
that there'll be some scott adams who
does a like a horrible terrorist act or
something and i'm gonna have to deal
with that with the rest of my life but i
feel sorry also for the people who have
my name who are not me
at least if you have my name and your me
you get some of the benefits you know
being the dilbert guy but imagine having
my name
but not getting into the benefits
[Laughter]
that would suck
is dilbert made in china with forced
child labor how would i know that
did i do a
do you think i did a factory check
so all the gotcha people
let me just classify you all as idiots
you can gotcha all day long because i'm
stipulating
all right gotcha doesn't work
when the person you're gatching
stipulates it
those are facts that are true
okay you don't need to
tell everybody because i told everybody
you're not you're not adding anything
add something
add in anything be useful
you're being completely useless
right because if you want more people to
know about
that some dilbert products are made in
china i'll tell them
you don't have to tell them i'll tell
them i've told you many times
all right
so
just take your gotcha
and go home with it
um
i want to rub it in
you can rub it in but it doesn't bother
me
i mean
i'm already bothered by the fact that
there are products i'm associated with
made in china you can't bother me more
than that
do you think that your public shaming of
me would bother me more
than the fact that the products are made
in china
it was not even close
i'm immune to public shame
but i really hate the fact that the
country that killed my step-kid i'm
doing business with
you can't make me like this less than i
like it
all right if you think any any other
shame
can make me hate this situation more you
don't understand
where i'm at on this situation
all right
um
rubbing pain reliever in the wound
um stop signing the contracts i don't
sign the contracts
the
i don't sign any contracts with chinese
companies and nor would i
you understand that right
i personally
you know my entity which is a
corporation
we don't sign any contracts with china
publishers do and people who do third
party work do
now i have a
you know a limited amount of
uh
power over them
but
you know it's certainly something i
brought up and will be bringing up again
it's just the alternatives don't exist
if they had alternatives they'd be using
them already
all right um
i'm in control of everything but i'm not
in control of that
the absolutists
you know
most of the people who disagree with me
fall into this category of being
absolutists
in the sense that
people are still arguing that the
vaccination doesn't work because it
doesn't work all the time exactly the
way we hoped it would
what's wrong with you
we all know it doesn't do everything we
wish it did
that doesn't make it nothing
it's still something
only siths deal in absolutes exactly
um
yeah i saw the mansion
face plant behind schumer
you know i didn't hear schumer's speech
but i heard it was
not ideal
uh discuss dave chappelle i did discuss
him yesterday
i think he's i'd like to watch the uh
special
i i saw meme going around accusing him
of saying something vile
not about
the trans folks
but on another topic that looked like
fake news
because there's no way that he said the
things that the meme says he said
there's just no way
so if you see that i'm not even going to
tell you what the topic is because it's
so fake news yeah
exactly somebody in the comments has
seen it
there's no way that he said that in the
same context as being reported anyway
i'm gonna have to see it myself and make
that judgment
all right
probably watch it tonight i think
saying vaccines don't work is like
saying they're safe and effective
no it isn't
saying they're effective is just true
right
they're just not 100 effective
well according to the
let's uh
i will bow to the audience and say
that according to the experts
they're effective ish
all right um that's all i got for now
slow news day and i will talk to you
tomorrow and it will be amazing
won't it
it'll be amazing
and uh
oh andrew yang starting the forward
party uh you know
i don't know what andrew yang hopes to
accomplish
uh but what he might accomplish is
taking a lot of votes away from
democrats
so
you know that that's probably all that's
going to end up happening
um and i will talk to you
tomorrow
