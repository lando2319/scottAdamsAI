good morning everybody and welcome
to coffee with scott adams you're
feeling better already aren't you
did you wake up feeling a little little
tired this morning
and now you notice as soon as this goes
live boom your energy starts to pop up
it's going to be good yeah there's a
white board behind me where do you see
the ladies don't don't cheat don't look
no no you're looking ahead don't do that
no no no no
before we get to the whiteboard we've
got to get to something far more
important maybe more important than
climate change
more important than
science it's called the simultaneous sip
and i know that those of you who have
experienced it
can vouch for its power
those of you who are just coming in new
or maybe
maybe finally got here on time
well you're in for a treat because the
simultaneous sip will take you to a new
level one you've never experienced
before and all you need is a copper
burger glass a tanker chalice or stein a
canteen jugger flask fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
except science it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now go
oh i see a resistor
somebody somebody says skip the sip
there are always rogues
we have a rogue anti-sipper
yeah i'm gonna brand you
i i'm not even going to entertain your
argument this sipping could be bad for
you no
no i'm going after the messenger
we have an anti-sipper
science has proven
that sipping your beverage with me makes
you healthier and happier
science i tell you
i don't have a link to it right now but
trust me
lots of links to it i just don't have
one right now but trust me
a lot of science behind it so the
anti-sippers
i brand you an anti-sipper
i can't i can't have any respect for you
now
well uh trudeau
up there in canada
or if you're watching from canada
right where you are in canada
he was referring to
people across the country
lighting candles to honor the indigenous
women girls and
it turns out that the lgbt
which added the q so it's now lgbtq
just keeps adding letters
so the difference between the lgbtq
and what i'm going to read in a moment
uh it's
it feels like it's turning into
some kind of a
i don't know uh
blockchain code or something but here's
what trudeau used
2s lgbtqia
plus
and apparently that that does capture
as many people as possible so
i might start adopting this
because i respect the people in the
2slgbtqia
plus community
now a lot of you people
are just bastards
you're bastards a lot of you
a lot of you are just bastards
and you do not respect other people as
much as i do
you should you should take a tip from me
be more respectful of your fellow human
beings and step up
step up
if you can
if you can figure out how many prime
numbers there are between 0 and 100
million it should not be hard for you to
memorize 2sl
gbtq
ia
plus
and i believe we should all use it from
now on and nothing else
because if you use anything else well
you're a bastard you're a
bastard well of course there is yet
another school shooting i'm not going to
name the shooter or the school because
um i don't like to do that
uh he was bullied
so a boy was bullied and he took a gun
to school and shot a bunch of people
now if this story
had been had been only about him killing
his bullies
i would feel different about it
i would feel different but i think he
killed people who were not his bullies
and
at least shot people shot his teacher i
don't think the teacher was a bully
although maybe the teacher could have
done more but i don't think that
deserves getting shot
i have the following comments about this
story
nobody cares when boys get bullied
except maybe the parents and the boy
himself
nobody cares when boys get bullied
and so
some of these boys are going to go home
and get a gun
and they're going to make you care about
them
that's what you did
this kid said you don't care about me
i don't care about you
went home got a gun i don't know where
he got the gun
went to school and
did some horrible things now i do not
condone this let me be as clear as
possible
i do not condone or encourage this
behavior
it is however a guaranteed outcome
it's a guaranteed outcome
men and boys can you back me on this
if boys are treated like they don't
exist and they don't matter
despite being abused they will resort to
violence
that's how we're designed
don't be surprised
don't be surprised i mean you have to do
everything you can to stop it but don't
act surprised
we've developed a system
that guarantees we create more of these
school shooters
if you create a system that guarantees
you have school shooters don't act
surprised
you treat boys like they're just pieces
of
that don't matter whatsoever
don't be surprised if they act exactly
the way you treat them
that's how it works
you treat somebody like a criminal
they're more likely to become one
there's lots of science behind that
right the way you treat people is what
you turn them into right you abuse
people they become abusers you treat
people like they're great they start
performing better because i think really
i didn't think i was that good but maybe
i am
so yeah our system turns boys into
school shooters
don't be surprised
um
the optimist in me says i wish that
there were enough of these as horrible
as they are you don't want more of them
but you you know you wish that there
would be a
accidental benefit which is that bullies
would stop bullying because they'd be
afraid of getting shot
um
if i were bullied
in school
i would start sending my
bullies
articles about school shootings
i would send my bullies
articles about school shootings
i would immediately be pulled out of
school and probably um
i imagine i would be in a lot of trouble
for that
and boy would i enjoy that
imagine being the guy who who got got
bullied
and you started sending just through
social media you start sending your
bullies the school shooting articles
well immediately you're going to be
called into the principal's office right
your parents are going to be pulled in
they're saying
dude
you cannot be sending
these dangerous messages about school
shootings
to your bullies
to which i say
as a person being bullied
oh god i need to swear now i need to
swear so badly but i'm gonna i'm gonna
take your advice as hard as this
as hard as this is you are right all
right those of you who have said
swear less
because you know you like to show it to
your kids and stuff in some cases you're
not going to want to show this one to
your kids but
but uh so if i'm that kid who's bullied
and i've been called into the office and
said why are you sending these dangerous
articles around about school shootings
i would say
i would look the principal in the eye
and i would say the reason i'm doing
this
is because you're not doing your f in
job
if you could do your job
i wouldn't do this
your job is to keep me safe
you're not doing your job
and by the way the parents of these
bullies
they're not doing their job
and of course the bullies are are
so
let me explain this to you mr principal
if you don't do your job i have to do it
for you
that's my only alternative
because i'm not going to be unsafe
do you understand mr principal
that you're not going to give me the
unsafe option i choose not to take it
i realize that you'd like me to go back
to this bullying situation and do
nothing about it and not do your job
i'm gonna do your job until you can do
it
if you can step up
i'll stop doing this
if you don't step up
we're going bigger on this
because right now i'm only dealing with
the school tomorrow i'm going to deal
with the press
if you don't think that was me at age 15
you didn't know me at age 15
because i would have i would have done
that
i would have called the principal on
doing his job and that would have been
the only topic
and i wouldn't even talk about what i
was doing i was saying i'm not even here
to talk about that
that's not even the problem
somehow you thought i'm the problem
apparently you don't know what problems
look like let me explain what a problem
is the problem is getting bullied
every day
and nobody doing anything about it
that's a problem
i'm dealing with a problem
your problem i'm solving it for you
let's see you do it
you you solve the problem for me and i
won't solve it
so that's how i would have handled it
um how many of you were bullied in
school
in the comments
how many of you were bullied in school
lots of yeses
seeing some no's
isn't everyone yeah somebody said isn't
everyone it's pretty much universal
right
close to it the the people who say no
were probably
large
or muscular or something
well i got this advice
from
one of my twitter
friends marco loveliner
he said that uh
the way he dealt with it as a parent
was to talk to the parents of the police
he would call a personal meeting with
the parents of the bullies
what do you think of that idea
have a personal meeting with the parents
of the bullies
i'm looking at your comments
some people say bad some good a little
mixed a little bit mixed idea in that
right
well here's some context
mark
mark is a bodybuilder
now what do you think of the idea
how would you like a bodybuilder showing
up at your front door
you and your husband the accountant
opens the door
and the bodybuilder says to you in
completely non-threatening tones
well we have a problem with your child
your child is is bullying my child
and we're going to make that stop so
tell me what you're gonna do
to make that stop
now imagine you're the dad
and the guy talking to you could rip you
apart
in a heartbeat just could rip your body
apart
but he's polite i mean he's not doing
any bullying he's just saying we've got
a problem what are you going to do about
it now i would argue that maybe this is
a terrific idea if you're if you're mark
this is probably a really good strategy
if you're physically intimidating
and you don't use the intimidation you
just you know it's just exists but
you're not using it that would be a good
strategy i think
i'll tell you the strategy i used i
brought a weapon to school
don't recommend it
but i had some bullying problems so i
just brought a weapon to school and took
care of it now the weapon was a club
which because
because i was
on path to be valedictorian at my school
at the time
which was sort of well known people
expected i would be either one or two or
something like that and so the way i was
treated
was the opposite of discrimination
so i actually walked down the hall with
a weapon in my hand now what would have
happened if the if the principal had
said hey you can't bring a weapon to
school you literally have a club
in your hand walking down the hall
you can't do that
if i'd been called in what would i have
said to the principal
i'm doing your job
your job is to keep me safe
didn't do it
now i'm going to do it so i took the
club and i beat my bully with it in the
hallway in front of as many people as
you know were walking around it was
lunchtime
it's the last time you bothered me
now in the old days that's the way we
did it i don't recommend it in the new
days in the new days you probably go to
jail for that sort of thing in the old
days you could be somebody to have to
death
and you just had a good reason and you'd
be fine
literally if you just had a good reason
you know where i grew up oh you had a
good reason oh okay that'd be the end of
it
so i don't recommend this by the way
don't don't do violence in 2021 it's not
going to work out
but there are lots of ways to handle
these situations
um i'd like to teach you now
how analogies work
now this came from a situation that i
was in myself
all right i can start generically to
teach you how analogies work
and then i'm going to tell you what
trouble i got into
being a dumb ass and using an analogy
all right so we're going to start with
the lesson
and then i'll make it applicable to the
the headlines
all right
let's say
somebody says to you
that there's a particular automobile
it's very fast
and to make that case they say
this is a new porsche let's say it's a
porsche
it's like a cheetah
this porsche is it's like a cheetah
now
if if you do not have cognitive
dissonance
how do you interpret
this car it's like a cheetah
all right if there's no cognitive
dissonance you handle that pretty well
don't you
you say to yourself oh i get it
this is a person who's saying that a car
is very fast maybe even one of the
fastest of the cars
because the cheetah is the fastest of
the animals
it's like a cheetah it's probably one of
the fastest cars simple right
no problem
everybody understands a good analogy
right
now here's the problem
it works really well if you're talking
about cars because nobody really has a
different opinion about cars
if it's fast it's fast okay it's a fast
car but when you get into politics
and social stuff everybody has different
opinions
so if you give somebody an analogy
that challenges their opinion what
happens
let's say it's a good analogy that makes
a point that challenges their opinion so
it actually does
challenge the opinion what happens
well if you've been following me for a
while or or if you study psychology on
your own you know that what happens is
cognitive dissonance
so if somebody disagrees with you with a
good reason
and you don't want to change your mind
because you're so sure you were right
but that is a good reason
you you get triggered into a
hallucination essential
and you start to imagine things that
aren't there
that's what the cognitive dissonance
does and that imagination is what papers
together your inconsistent world
so it's the the papering part that's the
cognitive weird part
and so what you do is say scott
that's a bad take
because you just compared
you dumbass you just compared oh my god
face bomb
face palm
seriously
you just compared an animal to a car
where's the carburetor on the cheetah
seriously scott
find me the carburetor on the cheetah
and then i'll maybe think you're making
sense but do you understand
that animals and cars aren't the same
i mean my god you fool
okay that was a forehead palm you
so
cognitive dissonance will cause you to
question the details that are different
between the two things
in your analogy
this is how you know it's cognitive
dissonance
because it isn't really hard to
understand
that the real point is the speed
it's actually pretty easy to understand
and if you don't understand something
that easy
and instead you're saying ah
but
one has pause
and one has wheels
stupid
how do you compare something with pause
to something with wheels
all right if you're talking like that
you're experiencing cognitive dissonance
all right
so what was my example that got me in
trouble was it about cheetahs and cars
no
it was not about something harmless
which you all would have understand
because you certainly understand easy
analogy
i did something very dumb
very dumb
dumbass
me
dumbass
me
all right are we all on board that what
i'm going to talk about next is me
making a mistake
i do this for the benefit of
those of you who say
scott
you never admit when you make a mistake
yeah i do
i i might admit when i make a mistake
literally more than any human being
alive
in the public figures anyway i literally
wrote a book on it
a book with all the mistakes i made
on a regular basis
i go in front of the
whatever world is watching me and tell
you exactly what i got wrong
fairly regularly
and i'm doing it again right now okay
and and tomorrow somebody'll say you
know the thing i hate about you most is
you never admit you're wrong
the world we live in all right
so here's the mistake i made
i said in a just an offhand comment in a
tweet it was just a tweet reply so i
didn't put much
thought into it and i did something dumb
i used an analogy in a political
conversation
if you put an analogy in a political
conversation
what happens
cognitive dissonance
and so
when i said when somebody was saying hey
we don't want the government mandating
these vaccines which by the way i agree
with
hold on stop
i agree with the point
i don't want the government mandating
vaccinations okay
at least the covert vaccinations
but i said hey dia do you wear c
cognitive dissonance
how would you interpret the analogy
where somebody was talking about vaccine
mandates and they don't want them
and i don't want them either
right so we're on the same page
and i and i said to that other person
who was complaining i said hey do you
wear seat belts
here's the correct way to interpret that
the seat belts are mandated by the
government
and vaccinations are mandated by the
government
and that we live in a world where the
government mandates all kinds of things
for your body
they can draft you they can put you in
jail for not paying your taxes they can
shoot you for committing crimes
the government completely controls your
body already which is the point
now
why do i say that if i agree that the i
don't want to mandate
why would i be telling somebody
the government already mandates all
kinds of things for your body
sounds inconsistent doesn't it
it's not inconsistent
it's context
context is never wrong
context is not an argument
context doesn't prove a case
it's just useful
it is useful to me
to know that the question of whether the
government can control your body is
settled
it is settled
the government can and will control your
body
often in ways you don't like
should they do it in this specific case
well that's something to talk about
so if you're talking about this specific
case yeah let's talk about that and i'm
on your side if you don't want to
mandate
but if you're talking about the larger
question can the government mandate
something that you know goes right to
your health and safety yes yeah they can
draft your ass and send you to another
country where you get shot by a stranger
they can do that
they have all that power and they use it
all the time when they think it's a good
idea should you push back sometimes yeah
of course
of course the public should push back
absolutely but the only the only point
to the seat belts is there was one
example and of the thousands i could
have given
from you know
getting drafted to you can't drink and
drive to god knows what
so it was just one of the many examples
the only thing you should have taken
from it is that
the government already controls your
body now
having defended what i said
did i just tell you that i'm right after
all because i just defended it hey
what's wrong with you
for not understanding my analogy nope
nope
no this was my mistake
my mistake was using an analogy
carelessly
in a political conversation
as a communicator
i give myself an f
because i caused a whole bunch of people
who are completely in agreement with
me to say on social media i have a bad
take
people who completely agree with me just
on this minor point about mandates
completely agree with me
but they saw the analogy and they
decided that the analogy was working
against their point
which it does
but it doesn't work against their point
enough
to change their mind or mind
all right so i'm giving you point and
counterpoint because i like to show you
the whole story
but it didn't change my opinion
the fact that this works against my own
my own point of view
it's just
context
and there
was that anything that uh
was useful i don't know
maybe that was just for me
there's a uh
oh here's a
interesting news
apparently cnn anchor jake tapper
i was talking about president biden's
poll numbers are down to even in the
quinnipiac
poll
down from he had been in the 50s
in approval and is now down to 38 which
even jake tapper
calls quote
brutal and brutal
and
so
i guess everybody's noticed
now i'm going to
tie this into another thing i was going
to talk about later but i'm going to tie
it in now which is
don't you love it when
people are talking in public and they
give you their internal thought process
and you're thinking to yourself don't
need that
i don't need you to tell me why you're
going to talk about the next thing
just just do it
we won't even need to know your internal
thought process
but have you noticed that uh so biden's
poll numbers are in the toilet and a lot
of things are going wrong right
now
look at the news coverage of trump
today
the news coverage of trump today what
does it focus on
which part of all everything that we
know about trump are they focusing on
now
well they're focusing on january 6
and whatever role trump had in that
now
what did january 6 have to do with
trump's let's say job description
in other words
where does it say in the job of the
president
you know do something about the
protesters
going to the capitol or something sort
of was outside of his general job
description right it's something he did
and you know of course he had a role in
it and it was it was important
but not really what you think of as the
job of president
why is it that all of the focus on trump
in terms of criticism
is not about the four years he was
president
but rather
the first day he wasn't
think about it
all of the criticism of trump today
is about when he wasn't president
why
because if you compare him on policy
policy to policy with biden
he runs the table
he runs the table on policy
name something that
names something that somebody in the
middle of the country not somebody on
the far left or the far right but just
say a mainstream voter
let's say an independent
an independent who could go either way
what's an independent supposed to make
of the fact that they're not even going
to compare biden and trump policy to
policy
because it doesn't work out
you could make an argument that trump
was better on everything at this point i
mean if you had some specific you know
liberal
issues you know some eos that got
reversed or something maybe you like
that
but to me
it looks like trump ran the table
policy to policy
right afghanistan
trump
right
um
now of course you you know that's
subject to great argument but i would
say that the left has conceded uh the
policy
argument
it feels like the left has conceded
that trump was just better on policy
because if he wasn't
what the hell would they be talking
about they'd be talking about all the
mistakes he made that biden corrected
right the news would be nothing but
man
that trump sure screwed things up but
good thing biden strained it out
where's that story
doesn't exist
so
if you don't think trump can win in 2024
oh my god it's starting to look easy
and the only thing that the critics have
now is to scare you
about the january 6th thing and turn it
into a he's a dictator and waiting and
stuff like that
i don't think anything looks less
dictatorish than what happened on
january 6.
that's the least dictatorish thing i've
ever seen
and it wasn't close it wasn't like the
government almost got taken over or
something like that
all right um
i would i would go so far as to say that
the current coverage of trump given that
he's not even in the race yet although
we expect he will be
is like a trump vaccination
so i feel like the news from the left is
trying to vaccinate the country against
trump
by talking about january 6 over and over
and making that the story because it's
all they have so the only way they can
vaccinate you is to go after the spike
protein of the trump experience which is
january 6.
i'm just quite proud of what i just did
there
can we take a moment
can we take a moment to
revel
in the clever analogy i just used
what he used an analogy
he never learns no he never learns
but yes
january 6 is the spike protein
that they're trying to vaccinate you
with all right
um
here's
here here's the best argument that
vaccinations work
i saw this on a viral clip there was a
nurse explaining
the best evidence that the vaccinations
work
okay
do you think that i'm going to give you
a good explanation that is going to
convince you let's say those of you who
are sort of
skeptical of the vaccinations do you
think that i can say in one sentence
i'll be quoting this nurse roughly
quoting her
do you think i can convince you the
vaccinations are safe in one sentence
that you haven't heard before
because i'm going to try to do it
here's the nurse's explanation
of how you can know for sure that the
vaccinations are safe
in one sentence
they were given to their rich white
people first
and i'm done
and i'm done
and as the nurse says if we weren't sure
that they would work
we would have given them to the black
and brown population first or poor
people in general
now i'm not serious in case you thought
i was that's that's not a real argument
but it does raise a question doesn't it
you know how often i've said to you
follow the money
it's like well that shouldn't be so
predictive but why is it always
why is it always that people have the
same
same philosophical preference
that just happens to match what would
make them more money
yes our philosophy tends to match
exactly what makes us more money
that's who we are
and then we think we're making a
philosophical decision
so
i'll just put that out there if if the
people if the elites
if the elites had any question about the
vaccination
they wouldn't have given it to
themselves first
i say that facetiously all right because
sure they might have but
it is a funny comment
it's a funny comment because it makes
you think about the whole
the whole of how everything works
that's what i like about it it's kind of
brilliant that way
all right
um
how about this for good news
talk about news that gets buried
there's a malaria vaccine
a vaccination for malaria brand new
that could save you know somewhere up to
400 000 lives per year
a malaria vaccine
so here's here's the part that blew my
mind
so i read a story about a new
malaria vaccination
which has been tested in trials and did
well
um
how long has the vaccination been around
i don't know
it wasn't in the story
don't you think that would be
kind of important
you know given that all we're talking
about with the coronavirus vaccination
is how long it's been you know tested so
there's a major story about this malaria
vaccine and it does not include how long
they've been testing it
that seems like an omission
but i think it's more like a uh
it could be more
closer to the point that uh
you gotta gotta start someday and i
guess the trial made them comfortable
enough that they're gonna go ahead
all right
um
there is a
dangerous dangerous tweet on twitter
right now
dangerous i say
um i'm gonna tell you what it is but put
your cautions up okay
like put on your your skeptical helmet
right i need you to be maximum guarded
for skepticism before i tell you what
this tweet was
there's some entity and i don't think it
matters who but they're they're offering
a million dollars
for anyone who can prove that the excess
deaths in the various uh states and
countries
um are caused by the covid
and not the vaccination itself
somebody's offering a million dollars
if you can prove
that covet is what's killing the extra
people and not the vaccination itself
a million dollars if you can prove that
now given that that is the primary uh
medical consensus
that the vaccination is saving you know
millions of lives
wouldn't it be easy to get this million
dollars
seems like it'd be pretty easy
but that's what makes it interesting
because the individual shows a lot of a
lot of data and of course nobody you
shouldn't believe any data you see on on
the internet
but
uh plenty of data to suggest that maybe
you couldn't prove it
that you wouldn't know the difference
between who got killed by the
vaccination and who got killed by
coronavirus
now remember i told you put on your
skeptical hat
i don't believe any of this in other
words i don't believe any of his data is
right
uh not any but you know i don't think
that it's is right in total and that
uh i don't think there's anything to it
what is ballsy
it's ballsy so i ran this by you know i
alerted my
primary skeptical people andres
backhouse
and anatoly
lubrowski
and uh levarsky and uh
i got only andres's comment before i
came live here and his comment was about
this fellow's analysis who's offer the
group that's offering the million
dollars
he said that about the analysis in
general this is so misguided and
amateurish that taking the million would
feel like stealing to me now i asked him
for a specific
because this is the sort of thing where
you need to give an example of what you
mean by what's wrong with it you know
just one good example like what's that
what's the main thing wrong with it
so i haven't heard that yet but
i have enough confidence in andres that
he's seen plenty wrong with it
he's seeing plenty that's wrong with it
so
i would say you should put a real big
doubt on that
and i also think that if if there were
anything to this claim
it would just be so obvious that
everybody would know it
i i
i guess you know you can always have a
situation where all the experts are
fooled
but it's unusual
to have this many experts all over the
world fooled the same way
that would be pretty unusual
um
yeah i think the the real problem here
is
that we don't believe any statistics and
you can do anything with them all right
so just keep an eye on that
there's a don lemon rant on cnn
not a rant but an opinion i shouldn't
call it a rant that would be
that would be putting too much opinion
on it
saying that
the internet should do more to regulate
the misinformation
so he's calling for more censorship
on social media platforms
and that there should be consequences
for that information if it's not true
and his argument is
wait for it
here's his argument
he says that it's completely practical
to do
to
to regulate the information on the
internet why
why does don lemon know
that it is perfectly practical
to get rid of the false information on
the internet
he says it's because
the legacy media did it
and they're doing it now
so if cnn can do it
why can't the internet
that's right
don lemon said that the internet
should do you know the social media
platforms could do more work to get rid
of the misinformation because cnn does
so there might be a little bit of a lack
of self-awareness there cnn literally
the uh
synonymous with fake news
if i said uh fake news
name an entity
just that i said just walk up to a
stranger and say fake news
name an organization
they'd look at you and say well i don't
know why you're asking this but
i don't cnn
it's the first thing you'd say
he doesn't understand that his network
is the most famous fake news entity in
the world
not the only ones with fake news of
course you know everybody's in on it but
they're the most famous example
by far
it seems like you need to mention that
in this context
so uh john uh yakelek whose last name i
always have trouble with
uh did this tweet and i thought this
captured
this captured the zeitgeist pretty well
do you want to capture the zeitgeist
yeah let's capture it
we don't have to because john did it he
tweeted this he said it just struck me
we're witnessing in real time the
spectacular accelerating failure of the
quote governance by expert class
model
it's folly's daily laid bare even as its
proponents double down on touting its
benevolent inevitability
so that's you know
that hits you doesn't it that feels
exactly what's happening we're watching
the complete destruction of the expert
class
but here's how he uh here's how he
dresses up now justin here's how he
seasons his his tweet
so he's telling you about the death of
the expert class most of you are in
watching it too and then he says
and it also struck me
in this lies hope
what do you think of that do you think
that the death of the expert class
which unfortunately means the death of
using facts and logic and science for
making decisions
because we don't know what are the facts
and what's the science we can't trust
anything if we don't use that model
what's the upside
what's the upside
of not not trusting any of the expert
class
i
i'm going to go with yarn on this i'm
going to go with you on on optimism and
here's why
you have to understand the problem
before you can fix it
right pretty much a generic
basic universal truth if you don't
understand the problem the only way you
could solve it is randomly and you know
how how likely is that
so
in order to understand the problem well
in order to fix the problem you have to
understand it and i believe that we're
at that point
we've reached the point where we know we
can't trust our experts or scientists or
politicians
so what do you do
well i feel like we're on the border of
needing something like a new model a new
system something that can help us solve
this exact problem
what would that look like
well i think i'm modeling it right now
i believe i am modeling the solution to
that right now but you need a more
robust version of that and the model
would be this
a uh
let's say a jury if you will i'll use
the word jewry loosely
of
skeptics
a jury of skeptics
now i have my own
sort of informal group of skeptics who
follow me on twitter and are
very um very kind to respond to lots of
you know queries where i say look at
this look at that takes a lot of time
right i'm asking quite a bit of them
andre's back house in particular the
amount of time i've asked him to spend
looking at stuff for your benefit and my
benefit as well
is quite a bit
i mean he's putting in a lot of work for
your benefit and not getting you know
paid for it anyway so i think that
unpaid um highly qualified people who
have a you know track record and also
the right credentials in this case phd
in economics
if they have the right credentials
we need a jury of skeptics
now what would be better than a jury of
skeptics
because you're going to not trust them
right
the jury is going to talk
believe those guys
all those skeptics are on the right or
all those skeptics are on the left or
something well more than one
more than one you should have more than
one jury of skeptics
maybe i'd have one try to be as
independent as possible
maybe other people have one
maybe every
oh here's a model for you how about this
how about this model for the future
everybody who has and i'll just throw on
a
for example
for example everybody who has over
a hundred thousand
uh twitter followers
just
just for conversation's sake let's say
that anybody who has over a hundred
thousand should have
also
a jury of skeptics who sort of are part
of their universe so that when they
tweet something that a hundred thousand
people
possibly lots more are going to see
that it would get tweeted with the
context of their own
experts so at least you it would travel
with the criticism as well as the
as well as the uh point
um now that's i'm just throwing out a
first idea right we're just
brainstorming but do you think that
there's any potential
that
a system could arise
they would give you some confidence
about the news you're seeing you know
just somebody who's good at looking at
the news
a jury of people who are good at looking
at statistics in the news and just say i
don't know trust that one and don't
trust this one
what do you think
somebody says is peer review but i'm
talking about more of a
immediate peer review
at a high level the the real peer review
gets into the details
and that's good too
i'm talking about just look at it
you know surfacy and is there anything
obviously wrong with that because it's
usually something obviously wrong
when i say obvious i mean obvious to an
expert not necessarily obvious to us
a live zoom panel yeah sometimes live
um
all right just looking at
oh interesting comment i'm seeing uh
that's what guffield does isn't it well
in a sense the guff held show is a group
of people who know a lot about uh
politics
in a sense they can act as skeptics
you're right yeah in in some sense i see
that but you'd want the
you know you'd want
a few more phds in economics and
you can throw in your cat temps and your
tyrus because they're great on tv
but you also need some some people with
serious credentials i think
um
did you see the the story about i guess
biden has a
stage set that looks like he's in the is
it the oval office the stage so that
when he does his tv appearances he's
actually not
in the oval office room that it looks
like
so his background is a fake stage
just made to look like he's in the white
house now
put on your conspiracy hats
we're going to take a ride
are you ready
put on the conspiracy hats
why would your government this is just
for fun by the way i'm not i'm not
saying any this is true
why would your government
want to build a fake set
for where the president
actually is every day
and where they've been doing this from
routinely for years
why
well
allow me to suggest a few possibilities
number one
sometimes he's not in the white house
right
if you get used to seeing the fake set
behind him
it would be really easy to reproduce the
fake set
from another location
right so i'm not saying that if they
have any plans to do that i'm just
saying it opened up that option a little
bit easier than using the real
background because the window
you know the the scenery in the window
would change but suppose they train the
public
that the set always looks like the fake
scent
then he can go anywhere they just
reproduce the fake set somewhere else
now would that be ever be useful maybe
imagine for security purposes
imagine for security purposes if you
knew the president was giving let's say
a live address
wouldn't that mean that you know
terrorists would know where the
president is
you could imagine a situation where they
want to fool bad guys
about where the president's location is
now let's suppose there's a
an attack on the capital terrorist
attack and the president needs to go
into hiding
so let's say the president is an
underground bunker
but he wants to look presidential
now they can just reproduce the stage
set in the underground bunker
and it looks like he's above ground
he's like i'm not afraid
but he's actually an underground bunker
so it opens up some options right
here's the other one and i know you're
already thinking this
uh
it feels like if anybody was ever going
to move toward creating a real digital
deep fake of a president
you would do this first
you would do this first
you would have to change the background
first
and get people used to it
why
because it would be much harder
to put a
fake person on top of a real background
not only because the weather outside the
window might be changing
that might be a tip off
but also and maybe i need an expert to
tell me this would you be able to pick
it up more easily if you had a uh
a fake image on top of a real image
versus all fake
is there anybody who knows enough
uh
machiavelli's uh
if
if
if my twitter user machiavelli is on
here i think you've got some experience
with this
head-on monitor no visible teleprompter
okay
controlled lighting yeah controlled
lighting is a very good reason to do it
because you don't want the open windows
that's a very good reason to do it yeah
in fact the the main reason might be
just controlling the lighting and there
was some talk about getting the
teleprompter out of the way so it might
be nothing but a production thing easily
could be nothing but that
well so here's here's the thing
i think they need to have a consistent
background to make it easier to put a
deep fake president in front of it
should we ever need to do that
i don't think that we need to do that
and i don't think there's like any media
plan to do that
but you would have to do this first and
that's a little suspicious to me
because you wouldn't want to have to
reprogram the background every time you
every time you put in a new biden right
if you wanted to program biden making a
speech a fake one a digital biden
you wouldn't want to have to do the
extra work of changing what's in the
window
and also corresponding to when the cloud
went over
right so imagine biden is in front of a
real window
and a cloud goes over
maybe you can see it
and then maybe somebody says wait a
minute i looked at the timing of this i
checked the clouds this doesn't make
sense it was a clear day
so i think you'd have to make the
background fake
and the same all the time
before you created your first deep fake
and put it on that scene you'd have to
prime people in the public first
now i don't believe any of this in the
conspiracy uh sense
it's just interesting
that there are two good reasons for
doing this one just to get a better
a you know better video
makes perfect sense
and the other is
longer term now let me ask you this
do you think that our cia et cetera has
already made deep fakes
of terrorists giving instructions to
their people
i don't know
but if they haven't
they're incompetent
because we should have seen back in
bin laden days there should have already
been fake videos of bin laden saying hey
lay down your guns and surrender or
something like that you know not not not
something that much on the nose it'd
have to be more clever than that
but don't you think that if we could
cause terrorists to not be able to
communicate directly because we would
catch them in their communication
one of the ways they communicate would
be to put a little video on you know
little memory stick and then have
somebody physically transport it and
play it in the computer on the other end
well if we can create fakes
how is anybody going to know they're
getting real
the real video from the real leader they
wouldn't know
so they would never know to be able to
trust
instructions for their own bosses
that would be kind of good for us to do
that to create that doubt
anyway that's what's that's what's
coming
looks like we're uh just about to the
end of our time together
uh scott the emmy friends of the cubicle
you make chinese dilbert products
because child labor is more practical
for your products
that's in vegas so every day people are
trying to shame me for the fact that my
publisher who by the way
i don't control
does their printing in china and i also
buy chinese products chinese made
products including my iphone
i'm not going to apologize for that
because i say over and over again
we should
decouple the thing the stuff that is
easy to decouple and we should take a
longer time
to decouple the stuff this could be
harder because there aren't alternative
sources so the moment there's an
alternative source
for printing dilbert calendars i will do
that
i'll push my publisher for the
alternative source but if the
alternative source is too expensive
meaning that it can't be profitable i'm
not pushing for that
so does that mean i'm putting
profits
over
people
no i'm putting people
at the top because you need profits
the thing that keeps people alive
profits
do you know why uh you know you can you
can have nice things if if any of you
have nice things do you know why you can
profits
profits yeah you don't want to stop
profit
you want to manage it and evolve it in a
in a way that you know you can have the
profit and also
a better world so no i'm not going to be
a dumb ass
and say you know stop doing business
instantly in every situation no
exceptions that would be dumb
it wouldn't be good for people
and if you if you imagine that that
would be a good idea you probably just
lack a understanding of economics
all right
uh
please explain profits to aoc
um
what's not fake just looking at some of
your uh
your comments before i sign off
okay the boo update boo was doing very
badly yesterday but probably dehydration
so i rehydrated her
and she's looking a lot better today
but i've got some delicate balance of
meds and trying to get her appetite
social you know so
so basically i'm involved in a uh a
chess game
and the chess pieces are like a bunch of
different medications
with the side effects with the illness
itself
and they all have to be in the right
order and then the race strategy or the
cat dies
trust me you do not want to be in my
situation
because it's really really complicated
the the scheduling of everything and the
the ins and outs and how to play it
and
it's hard it's hard
but
i'm doing my best
and she's looking good as of this
morning but she's still not eating on
her own but we have a plan to make that
happen
all right so we will not give up on boo
um
yeah
john i'm not going to respond to that
um
and that's all for today and i'll talk
to you tomorrow
