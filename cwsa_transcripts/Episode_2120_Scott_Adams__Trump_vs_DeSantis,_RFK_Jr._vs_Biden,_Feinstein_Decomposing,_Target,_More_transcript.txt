to do
good morning everybody and welcome to
another highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I
don't think you've ever had a better
time than you're going to have in the
next hour or so and if you'd like this
experience to go to levels that nobody
ever dreamed were possible all you need
is a cup of Margaret glass a Tankard
Chelsea's dying the canteen jogger flask
a vessel of a kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine here the day the thing that
makes everything better it's a little
Oxycontin in there too
uh actually toast not Oxycontin yeah
Oxycontin you're on your own but this
will give you oxytocin oxytocin don't
get those confused
simultaneousep happening now
ah
delightful
well uh Finland has a new problem and
their new problem is they have so much
green and cheap electricity that the
price temporarily went negative
now in the real world it wasn't actually
negative
but the price of electricity
basically dropped a zero
do you know why
take a guess why finland's electricity
went to zero
is there any idea and and also uh it was
Green
right it's totally green
nuclear yeah they just opened a big
Nuclear Plant
now they also had lots of water this
year so they're Hydro
you know their their dams and stuff also
we're producing record electricity but
at the same time that the nuclear plant
went online and started just pumping it
down
so for a while
finland's energy costs for consumers
was almost zero
and how did they get there
they did the obvious things
nuclear and you know I draw if you have
it
so
are you still worried about climate
change
if you could drive your electricity cost
down to close to zero
at the at the same time that you're
getting rid of all the you know all
carbon emissions
no I I feel like we have a solution here
and it's just screaming at US nuclear
well I saw an article that said Bill
Gates
thinks that he doesn't know who's going
to own the AI Market it could be a big
company like Microsoft he hopes so
but it could be some startup if you
mentioned one in particular a company is
called inflection
and they already have a little app
called Pi bi
and here's what caught my attention uh
number one the Bill Gates called it down
specifically and he said he'd used it
and it looks like
it could be one of the winners one of
the ones that will really be the thing
now he described as as a personal agent
basically like a little AI personality
that can talk to you
so I said to myself whoa
that sounds good if Bill Gates says this
might be the one and obviously he's
tapped into everything that's going on
I'm going to download that thing and I'm
going to see what makes this better than
all the rest
and let me tell you
I was blown away
Blown Away
do you know what it can do
it can talk to you as stupidly as all
the other AIS
that's it
that's all it can do
it can talk to you it can't it can't
make any important opinions because it's
not allowed it doesn't have access to
the internet
just hold this in your mind Bill Gates
was blown away by it
doesn't even have access to the internet
and it doesn't say anything that chat
GPT doesn't say or being AI or all the
rest and none of them can do anything
useful because they're not allowed to do
anything provocative which is the only
thing we care about
and he was blown away by it
now here's here's a uh I gotta connect
some conspiracy theory uh dots you ready
I'm going to go full Conspiracy Theory
what I say after this point is not
backed by fact are you okay with that
what I say next is not backed by fact
pure speculation no more likely than the
moon landing was faked for example bad
example because a lot of you think it
was faked but
going pure conspiracy theory
one of the founders of this app that
Bill Gates seems to think is good is
Reed Hoffman
do you know who Reid Hoffman is
so he was the founder of LinkedIn now
sold to Microsoft so he's a
multi-billionaire
also a framed investor you know one of
the early Facebook people earlier on
Airbnb
so he's one of the most famous
investment Geniuses but he's more than
that he's also one of the people who
came up with some of the social media
algorithms that make Facebook work
such as recommending your friends and
turning it into a network effect so Reid
Hoffman is sort of the
you could sort of say he was the father
of the network effect where if you get
into an app it's hard to go anywhere
else that's what LinkedIn was if you're
on LinkedIn and somebody else started a
similar app you weren't going to go
there because all your friends were in
LinkedIn and Linkedin would keep
suggesting you you know to get other
people in there same as Facebook
so here's the other thing about Reed
Hoffman
do you recognize his name from before
any of these things
do you know where he first succeeded
now you're thinking of a different read
Netflix is a different that's a
different read
um
he's the
he's one of the PayPal guys
so the so-called PayPal Mafia which were
the includes Elon Musk and
uh it's people who went on to
to become billionaires
right so did you ever wonder how PayPal
succeeded
I was always curious about that imagine
being the first startup that makes an
app that can move money around
how in the world did that ever get past
regulators
how in the world did that get past the
banking in industry
do you ever wonder about that because
because the technology that PayPal had
was probably trivial you know in terms
of what was possible at the time it
probably wasn't hard to make the app and
what was hard is to get it in the market
get people to trust it give Banks to you
know not try to stop it or not succeed
and get the government to say yeah you
can do this almost impossible
ah
have you noticed that the PayPal people
all have really good powers of
persuasion
and that they went on to start companies
which you'd say to yourself
you know I don't even think that company
could have succeeded unless the
government was somehow
you know a little bit on their side
right didn't you think that about Tesla
correct me if I'm wrong but weren't
there a very large subsidies
they're government subsidies right so
Tesla basically can exist because of the
government how about uh SpaceX
would SpaceX be a viable company without
government contracts
I actually don't know the answer to that
question I'm thinking though
I'm thinking probably not
or at the very least there must be
incredible hurdles that you have to pass
to get into the space business
so we see a pattern here of people who
are involved in the PayPal Mafia
seem to be able to create new companies
they have that same weird quality that
PayPal had which is how did you get the
government to go along with us
you ever wondered about that
how in the world did they get past all
those regulations and stuff
well
I'll give you one hypothesis
their CIA back
and always have been
it now I'm not saying I have any I have
no data no information whatsoever
to back that hypothesis
but there is a pattern there's a pattern
of success that has that weird quality
to it that the government really had to
be on your side in some important way
I don't know how you do that over and
over again
unless
unless
the CIA wants you to now why would the
CIA do a thing like that
like why would they do that
well why would the CIA want to know
um that people were moving money around
in a digital way
of course they want to know that that
they want to know who's doing illegal
things
so if people are paying cash you can't
track them but if they start paying on a
digital app
you can catch all the bad guys
so of course the CIA would want to be a
backer to any kind of digital movement
of money obviously of course they would
that doesn't mean they did I'm not
saying they did I'm just saying they
would have an obvious incentive to do
that
and likewise the CIA would say you know
if we don't own space we're going to be
in trouble
so they might say well let's get one of
our guys
to build a serious space industry and
we'll make sure the government has
enough support that it can succeed
uh CIA might say we need to own electric
cars
because if China becomes the only place
you can get a good electric car we're
really screwed
so maybe the CIA says well let's help
cut a little uh red tape for you here
we'll make sure you get some subsidies
so that you could be a a proper industry
now nothing that I've mentioned so far
would be against your interests as a
citizen would you agree with that
everything I've described would be for
the benefit of the United States
it would be you know a little more for
the benefit of CIA doing their job
perhaps but it would all be compatible
with your interests so it's not like
something
it's nothing to be alarmed at
but this this story where Bill Gates was
somehow impressed by an app that has
nothing to impress you
there's nothing about that app that's
impressive it's it's just nothing
but why is Bill Gates pushing it
Bill Gates has sort of mysteriously
successful isn't he
ever wonder how Bill Gates did so well
Bill Gates friend of Epstein
Epstein clearly connected
do you think that maybe one of the
reasons that Bill Gates and Epstein met
more often than you think they should
have
what if it wasn't about sex
what if it was actually because they're
both just CIA
involved people
you know not employees obviously but
maybe it was just
some dark business
it could have been
could have been because I would give you
another another reason why Bill Gates
would do something that seems so
obviously dumb
right
what are the other things that Bill
Gates does that are obviously dumb
name one
it's just something he doesn't do he
just doesn't do dumb things but
continually meeting with Epstein after
he had been convicted is unambiguously
dumb and even he says so
so why do you do dumb things if you
don't have to
there's some reason
now one the reason he's accused of is
having some kind of sexual
interest in common that would be a
little sketchy
that's what we assume because that's the
obvious thing right that's the most
obvious thing or blackmail those are the
obvious things but the less obvious
thing is that they might both be
obviously connected to intelligence
agencies and they might have had some
common
work
and that would be something that he
could never mention
so he'd be sort of screwed you'd have to
you'd have to let the sexual impropriety
thing just sit there because he can't
explain the real one
I remind you
that a hundred percent of stories about
public figures are false
I know it's hard to believe
but trust me they're false at least in
terms of being incomplete where the
where the part that's missing would
change how you think about it completely
so when you look at something like Bill
Gates the thing I can guarantee is you
don't know the story
ever there's always something very
important about the story that you think
you know that you don't know
that is just always the case sir and the
more more public the figure is the more
true that is and the more complicated
their situation is the more true that is
yeah so you don't know anything about
Bill Gates
it would be impossible because the news
won't tell you he's not going to tell
you
how would you know there is no there's
no way to actually know what the hell is
going on with Bill Gates ever
if you think you ever knew you didn't
because there's no there's no accurate
news about public figures ever none
about me that's for sure
all right well I'll just put that out
there that it's weird that
this app is getting some attention from
people who are
interestingly similar in pattern to
people who might have an intelligence
connection
just by pattern
so just a say it again none of what I
said about any of these characters is
based on any facts that I'm aware of
it's just pattern recognition that's it
which is a weak form of predicting the
future but there it is I'll put it out
there
um
have you come to this conclusion yet
I know we've all been heading there so I
think maybe you were all there before me
but sometimes you just have to
put a thought in words
that we were all thinking and then we
can go oh yeah that's it you just put
that in words just right so I may have
done this with this Tweet someone
accidentally
because so many people liked it I didn't
think people would like it that much
[Music]
um
but
I tweeted that the Legacy Media
its only purpose is to prevent the
citizens from finding out what the
government is doing
didn't it used to be the case
uh didn't it used to be the case that
you thought the news was to tell you
what the government is doing didn't you
but it's very clear that that's no
longer the case the the Legacy Media
is in the business of preventing you
from knowing what the government is
doing
the Legacy Media now fortunately we have
social media and there's competition in
the field
so you know you can get some of the
story
but that's literally their purpose
because the news that isn't about
politics isn't that interesting either
have you noticed that yeah we need to
know when hurricanes coming
but that's not the fascinating news it's
the political stuff that interests us
and
that is entirely designed to mislead you
so the Legacy Media is the phrase I'm
going to use for what used to be called
the news
because I don't think news is even
and I'm not I'm not using hyperbole here
this is not intended to be an
exaggeration news is the wrong word
am I wrong
because because news implies that you
you think it's true
whereas the Legacy Media is clearly not
in the business of saying things they
think are true
I'm not wrong am I
they're no longer in the business of
saying things that even they believe to
be true it's one thing if they're wrong
you know we accept that people can be
wrong about the news that's not even a
big deal but but it's now obvious
they're not trying to be right
that feels different it's not it's not
news whatever they're producing she
couldn't possibly be called news if the
idea is to prevent you from knowing
what's happening and clearly that is to
prevent you
well here's the example of that
if you want some data to support that
point Rasmussen did a poll escanetta
Durham report and
when it first asks the questions about
you know what do people think about the
Durham report and the idea that the that
officials in the government were aware
from the beginning that the Clinton
campaign was going to make up the Russia
collusion hoax
that our government at the highest
levels were completely aware that it was
made up
now when Rasmussen asked people hey you
know what do you think should be the the
penalty
it kind of lined up by politics right we
ex we expect all the political questions
to be roughly Democrats say this
Republicans say that
but they found out that when they primed
the people with a one sentence summary
of what the Durham report said
it completely changed the answers to the
poll in other words the public was so
misinformed that they didn't know
because they watched Legacy Media if you
watched Legacy Media exclusively you
wouldn't even know that the biggest
thing ever had happened which is that
the Durham report showed that the the
people in charge were fully aware that
the Russia collusion was a hoax from the
start
they always knew it
and and so when Rasmussen asked the
question before private people you know
they have a certain set of answers that
line up by politics but as soon as you
tell them the Durham report proved
that the government and the FBI knew
that the Russian collusion was a hoax
suddenly you get uh
when told of the Durham conclusion this
is from Rasmussen when told of the
Durham conclusions 44 of the people who
thought Trump might have colluded with
Russia
keep in mind that people still think
that 44 of the people who still thought
Trump had actually colluded with Russia
after they were told what the Durham
conclusion was that it was the opposite
it was Hillary's team that made it all
up
uh 44 of those people changed their mind
immediately and wanted the FBI officials
criminally prosecuted
44 percent
of the people who just weren't aware of
the news as soon as they heard an
accurate summary of the news the Durham
report changed their answer immediately
because they had never heard the news
and this this was the news that if you
could call it news so this is the story
that made me think holy cow we no longer
live in a world where the news is even
trying to be news it's only trying to
prevent you from hearing stories that's
it it's it's news prevention
all right
um speaking of polls there's a Berkeley
IGS poll on Feinstein and as you know
Feinstein is decomposing in her chair
and doesn't remember that she was gone
for three months from the Senate
basically she's completely dysfunctional
and while we feel
you know human empathy for her situation
she does work for us
right she she works for us and she's not
doing the job
so those are just facts
but a uh there was a poll what uh well
well let me let me just do a little test
of my audience let's see if you can get
this within two basis points
obviously if you can guess the answer
within two
how many people pulled do you think
favor
Feinstein continuing to serve her job to
the end of her term
what percentage
wow you're very close and some of you
got it exactly it's 27 yeah about
roughly a quarter of the people asked
had no problem with a vegetable being a
senator
oh you'd like a
you'd like a potato to be a senator well
one quarter of us are totally on board
with that
how about a piece of broccoli would you
like a piece of broccoli to be your
senator represent your state
25 or so 27. about a quarter of the
people said uh yeah I'll be okay with
that I like a big piece of broccoli
representing me for a senator in the
Senate
all right so there's that
um
as you know
the opinion of billionaires in this
country
are more important than yours would you
all agree with that
the important the opinion of
billionaires way more important than
your opinion at least in terms of
influencing things right they're not not
more important than constitutional sense
they're just more influential
so that makes you wonder where is uh
where's Murdoch on all this stuff well
Murdoch as you know owns The Wall Street
Journal and the Wall Street Journal
editorial board
uh did a piece today on DeSantis
that I would say is pretty close to an
endorsement without actually saying
those words
so I would say it's unambiguously true
that Murdoch is backing DeSantis
now he hasn't said that
I'm just reading between the lines it
looks like that's the case yeah no no
surprise right because Burdock wasn't
pro-trump
anymore
uh speaking of DeSantis he said he would
pardon some January Sixers
you know obviously
you're all the smart audience you know
that he doesn't mean every one of them
he means the ones that it makes sense to
Pardon but he also said he'd pardon
Trump
what do you think of that
what do you think of that as a
persuasion play
that he would pardon Trump
yeah it's right it's right on right on
target exactly yeah so I'm going to say
this again
DeSantis does look like uh
a genius of persuasion
he hasn't made a misstep
I mean if he has it's been minor but he
is hitting you know Bullseye after
Bullseye in the messaging and
communication area
and that's hard to ignore right he's
picking up the Easy Money everywhere
so this is another example of that uh
it's it's Pitch Perfect
and he's reading the room perfectly
let's put it that way do you think that
the census reads the room
yeah like he reads the room better than
just about better than anybody
yeah Trump does too
so I'm not going to take that away from
Trump but he's he's just hitting it uh
he's just hitting every note
so Wall Street Journal likes him
and a lot of people like him
and he's saying that Trump ruined
people's lives with the lockdown this is
what the Santa says and that he you know
it was too close to fauci basically
so DeSantis is going to try to paint
Trump as a fouchy you know just like
fauci Plus
which is pretty good
politically fauci is so poisonous right
now with the Democrats I'm sorry with
the Republicans that that's a perfectly
smart play
because he can just let all the Badness
of fauci bleed onto Trump
and and you'll just feel different about
him Trump and you won't know why it's
just because the the fouchy ugliness
could get you know transferred a little
bit if DeSantis keeps on it so real good
technique
uh here's an update on the Target stores
and the what they did or did not do in
terms of offering
trans-friendly things to Children
allegedly
but not really
so here's what I've learned
Target sometime a day ago did away with
um
child sizes
for teenagers
now I'll need a fact check on this but
this is what I understand so in other
words a a 13 or 14 year old
would be buying a dull sized clothing
just because they found no reason to
have different sizes for people who are
largely the same size right a 16 year
old girl is not going to be that
different than a 30 year old adult
right so so some time ago some time ago
Target got rid of these you know
teenager sizes
so the question is did they make
uh
trans specific clothing
with we're only limiting this to the
tuck swimsuits
did they make a tuck swimsuit targeted
for teens and the answer is only
accidentally
because if they made one for adults it
would be the same sizes as the teens use
so accidentally yes they did
intentionally it doesn't look like it it
looks it looks like a really bad mistake
it looks like they didn't realize that
because their sizes were no longer you
know discriminating between teenager
sizes and adult that it would be seen as
you know a product for people under 18.
so I'm not going to defend Target
but it looks like more of a mistake than
uh some kind of a strategy to turn to
teens into something
so that so my current take is that if
you would like hold on hold on if you
would like to in your secret thoughts
believe that Target did this
intentionally I have nothing to argue
against that are you okay with that
if you think they did it intentionally
there's no obvious proof that it wasn't
intentional
however there is an alternate
explanation
which is perfectly reasonable
that it could be just because they don't
have a size distinction and they wanted
to do it for adults
and then there it was so at the very
least they didn't put up a guard rail
would you agree with that at the very
least they did nothing to make it look
like it was limited to adults and that
would be a corporate mistake that
they're paying for but there is not
evidence of their thoughts
would you give me that
there is no evidence of their thoughts
right if you believe you know their
thoughts you might be right
you know if you look at the larger
context of society
you could totally be right but there's
no evidence of it there's no evidence of
their thoughts
so ah
you know I I always do this innocent
until proven guilty thing because I
think it's important but I tell you that
when it comes to the government
that doesn't count
when it comes to the government they're
guilty until proven innocent it has to
be that way they have to prove they're
not screwing you all the time or else
you assume they are
but what about a company like Target
is Target Presumed Innocent at least in
their thoughts not in terms of their
actions but are they Presumed Innocent
or are they a big Corporation and that's
more like the government you say you
know you're actually gonna have to prove
you didn't do this
yeah somewhere in between
all right
well I'll just leave that where it is
um
here's what I oh there's a kind of
interesting news that Ford has agreed
with Tesla
to use Tesla charging stations for the
Ford electric vehicles
is that foreshadowing something
I always wondered you know I had a
question whether that was going to be a
thing now obviously this is a good move
for consumers
if you're a consumer this is just great
but the question is why did musk
make this available
what was musk's play what do you think
why would he I mean as a competitor why
would he make it so much easier for a
competitor to sell cars that compete
with him
well I'll give you one answer
one answer might be that a musk wants to
control charging stations and if he can
prevent Ford from building out their own
charging stations
he can sort of get the public use to
using his
and then he can charge other companies
you know a little fee for for being part
of their system
and that he makes money by monopolizing
the the charging portion because Ford
probably would have built out their own
anyway if they had to
so and Ford will pay to build more you
said
yeah so this is very compatible with
musk's philosophy that I don't think
we've ever seen before which is he's
trying to build you know profitable
companies of course but he's very
focused on making sure that the public
is served
and that's one of the secrets of his
success is he is very obsessed same with
uh Jeff Bezos Jeff Bezos gets this right
as well they're obsessed with giving the
public what the public actually wants
and I don't think there's much the
public wanted more
than to know if they got an electric car
they'd be able to charge it
because a lot of people want electric
cars and they're worried about charging
stations right so you just took that
worry away also for his competition
which is
a very enlightened way to do business
but also something you can do if you're
doing well right he has such a dominant
position that he can he can think of
what's good for everybody and not give
up anything
I like everything about that story it
says it suggests
something positive happening in business
speaking of business here is the uh the
index fund I would like to invest in now
I am aware
that somebody has created an index fund
of companies that are not ESG woke
so I know that exists that's not what I
want
do you know why I don't want that
because it's it's too much of a gimmick
yeah that's what's called the strive
fund it already exists right so it
already exists
but I do think that there might be too
much in common with the companies that
are awoke versus the ones that are not
the companies that tend to go woke
tend to be the high-end companies
am I wrong
the high-end companies is that that's
for fake funds okay the high-end
companies will tend to be woke as they
have to but within the universe of woke
companies would you agree that some went
too far
right so here's what I want an index
fund of all companies The Fortune 500 in
America
subtracting
the worst 10 percent of the woke but
only 10 percent
I'll tell you why
if you only take 10 out you're still
going to have a good chance of having a
good portfolio
because that's plenty of diversity
taking 10 percent out
you know it might take out your best
your best performer
but it's 10 so maybe not
if you took out if you failed to invest
in the worst ten percent of the woke
then the woke would no longer compete to
be the most woke
you want them to say oh
I guess I can do a little bit of woke
but keep us out of the top ten percent
I would invest in that
whereas I have not been triggered to
invest in the strive fund which is only
unwoke companies because I think one
thing that makes you unwoke is being
unprofitable
oh here's a better way to say it
profitability
and wokeness are probably very
correlated because if you're already
profitable the only thing you want to do
is stay out of trouble
so you say wokeness oh yeah yeah plenty
of it and if that wokeness makes you
let's say a little less profitable
you can afford it if you're already
wildly profitable
so apple apple as a company
can afford all kinds of weakness
because they have so much profit even if
they took a hit you wouldn't even notice
it
but if you are struggling the last thing
you want to worry about is wokeness so
the reason I don't want to fund that is
just all the unwoke companies is that
that would include the struggling ones
I I want to just a good basket of the
top 500 companies minus
the top 10 percent worst woke wokesters
and that would be enough over time that
would be enough to Tamp down the worst
excesses of wokeness to get it down to
something you get used to
because you know unlike many of the
people in my audience
I don't mind calling people what they
like to be called
I've never understood why that was a
problem actually
as long as they don't give me a hard
time for using the wrong word
I'll be happy to correct because to me
it's just I've said this before it's
just manners
when people introduce me in public
they usually ask me how do you want to
be introduced you want to be the
cartoonist an author you want to be the
Creator
you know what what word are you
comfortable with being described with
and then I tell them usually doesn't
matter I don't care but I tell them and
then we're all comfortable it's just a
polite a polite way to deal with other
people so if somebody is born of
biological male
they've decided to transition and they
they look and present themselves as
female
I have any problem using the pronoun
they prefer
I don't even know why anybody would
because if you look at somebody who's in
full female
you know presentations
it shouldn't be hard to remember what
pronoun they want to be using and why
does that affect you in any way now I
get that if you start accepting the the
base reality of their claim then maybe
that gets to rights you know what
restroom you can use what sports you can
play on but I separate those
I I just think you can call people what
you call them and that's separate from
the conversation of do you want a 200
pound uh
trans woman who used to be a was born a
man
to compete in a boxing match against
somebody born a woman
no that's just obviously something you
need to work on
but I don't mind a little bit of
wokeness you know I don't mind making
sure that we don't discriminate
that's all good
all right
um Biden's numbers have collapsed and
even CNN is saying oh my God
Jake Tapper was just blown away by how
bad Biden's numbers are
here's the specific poll
released Thursday
shows the whopping this is CNN's take on
it 66 percent of Americans two-thirds of
them view a Biden victory in the
upcoming presidential election as either
quote a disaster
or a quote setback for the United States
two-thirds of the country believe that a
Biden president your second term would
be a disaster or a setback two-thirds
two-thirds means you're getting a lot of
people who are not just Republicans you
know Independents and Democrats
now
CNN also pointed out that that's not
that different than uh Trump so Trump's
numbers aren't that different
but Biden I don't think has ever had
numbers this bad
so as Jake Tapper and others have
pointed out
it looks like we're actually heading for
an election
of the two candidates that the country
least wants to be president
am I wrong about that we've somehow
developed a system to give us the two
choices that we all understand are wrong
but we still favor our own choice
because you know we don't want to give
up our own choice and we think our
choice could beat the other choice and
winning is more important yeah we're
more about winning
but how in the world did we drift into a
situation
where we're almost guaranteed the two
candidates of the two we least want as a
country least want
you might like one better than the other
but
both sides want somebody else
because of age
now in my opinion it's just age alone
would would tell you the whole story yes
I want somebody younger than Trump
absolutely
absolutely and younger than Biden of
course
um I saw Mark Cuban tweet today
talking about as long as we use the
system of primaries that we have now
we're always going to recreate this
situation
and that we need some kind of a better
selection process for picking from the
primary we we just don't have a
functionality system if we had a
functioning system it would not have
given us two choices of
people who are clearly older than you
want them to be although to be fair
Trump does look perfectly you know
perfectly fine at the moment
all right
um and even CNN was sort of talking up
um RFK Jr you know noting that he had a
now a good solid bite on I think he's up
to 20 in the Democrat primary
and I think you're going to see that
increase
all right here's the story I heard today
I don't know if this is true
but in the 70s the CIA developed a heart
attack gun
they can shoot you with a dart gun that
would give you a heart attack
and then the dart itself would dissolve
and then the the poison that it gave you
would be denatured quickly so even an
autopsy would not pick up the poison or
the injection site because there'd just
be a little spot
and then the dart would somehow
disintegrate
do you believe that
do you believe that
developed in the 70s
I don't know
I'm going to say I'm going to put a big
maybe on that one now of course people
connected it to the Andrew Breitbart
situation where he died of a heart
attack at a relatively on a young age
and without warning I guess
and he was exactly the kind of person
that you would kill
if you were a CIA operative who was
helping the Democrats
so
that's interesting
there's new George Floyd hoax going
around today so in 2020 the coroner's
report
it's being resurfaced so it's being
treated as if it just came out but we've
we've seen the coroner's report on
George Floyd since 2020.
and one of the things I said on the
report was that there were no neck
injuries
which people are taking to mean that it
must have been an overdose
because if uh Chauvin the cop was on
uh George Floyd's backslash neck you
should have seen some kind of neck
injuries but the hoax part is that we've
known this since 2020 and it was not
terribly important to the coroner's
opinion
so the yeah the new is on the back
exactly so there was no reason you would
expect the neck to have an injury
but the the argument was that given the
position of everybody it was the police
officers actions that caused the death
and here there's a new new part that I'd
never heard before so the coroner rule
down drug overdose fentanyl overdose
or opioid overdose and the reason he
ruled it out
is because the typical way you die from
an overdose is you just sort of close
your eyes and go to sleep
whereas George Lloyd was not acting like
somebody on fentanyl he was sort of
struggling until he stopped struggling
so therefore it did not look like a
fentanyl death
because the fentanyl death is just
somebody sitting in the chair and they
close their eyes
to which I say
um I wonder how much experience the
coroner had with people who had just
just taken the Fentanyl and were being
forcefully held on the ground
is that something you've seen a lot
somebody who just took fentanyl
allegedly I don't know if that's true
but some say he took it when he got
pulled over so he wouldn't get caught
with it but has he seen people who just
took fentanyl like just took it and then
you know three or four people are
holding him down
what would that look like if it were
offensive overdose what would it look
like
well I'm going to give you my impression
of what I think it would look like oh oh
struggling struggling struggling
struggling struggling
not struggling
dead
that's what I would expect
I would expect him to be struggling
while he could
while the fentanyl was reaching his
system because allegedly he just taken
it as it reached the system he would
stop struggling he would get quiet
it would happen kind of suddenly
and you wouldn't know that that was the
problem
because you were sort of in a different
mode you were in struggle mode and then
you just stopped struggling you think oh
he finally stopped struggling
but it could just be the fentanyl
Kingdom now I'm no coroner
but to me it looks like the coroner gave
the safest opinion he could to protect
his own life
and you cannot predict you cannot put
any credibility in a corridor who if he
had ruled the other way would be killed
how in the world Chauvin doesn't get a
you know some kind of an appeal
because the coroner was in a position
where his life was at risk if he had
given an opinion in The Other One
Direction his life was at risk obviously
like anybody who says his life was not
at risk you don't know anything he
clearly was a great great personal risk
family too
so I would say that there was no
corridors testimony
if I'd been in the jury I would have
said okay well I'm not going to believe
that guy
because there's no reason to believe him
if somebody is under threat of death
you are not advised to believe what they
say
that would be a dumb thing to do and yet
the jury did do you know why the jury
did
believe him
because they were at risk great risk of
being killed
everybody involved was at the risk of
being killed
there was no there was no way it could
go any other way everybody just was
protecting their own life
and they didn't particularly care about
Chauvin because he didn't come across as
a sympathetic character right they
didn't really care about him but they
certainly cared about themselves
certainly cared about themselves
all right
I saw a tweet by uh Twitter user who
goes by the title unhoodwinked
in which he was uh noting my persuasion
successes according to him
all right so now this is his opinion not
mine
so in his opinion
I had influence on the following things
and he says Scott's Scoreboard on issues
that you change the world so that's not
my claim I'm not claiming I influence
these things
I'm just claiming there's a lot of
coincidences here so here's the list
China is now deemed unsafe for business
you will recall I was the first one who
started saying that now it's obvious
ESG is now a negative value uh I would
argue it depends who you're talking to
but definitely the the reputation of ESG
is way worse
than it was when I told you I was going
to try to destroy it
that's not all me of course
bombing Mexican cartels is now accepted
as the best strategy by all of the
Republican Front Runners
I would argue that somebody had to say
it out loud
and then see how people reacted
for anybody else to say it out loud
so I said it out loud first publicly
Trump picked it up once Trump picked it
up
nobody could be soft on that
so all the Republicans have to line up
could be a coincidence
Tick Tock is under pressure to be banned
or at least adjusted in some way
I I think I was the first among the
first to talk about Tick Tock but not
the only one of course
and Sentinel overdoses now considered a
top concern
that's similar to the bombing the
cartels one uh nuclear power is
considered green
you remember when I started persuading
on that it was not considered green but
now it is
now obviously the the bigger persuaders
where you're you know Sheldon burgers
and you know Mark Schneider and Bjorn
lombborg and so they're the ones with
the heavy lifting but I was on the right
side of that
um
and then I'm not sure about this one but
Underwood on Hoodwinked
puts this on my list safe to discuss
moving away from areas deemed to be
unsafe for certain groups
I know do you feel it is now safer to
discuss
racial topics because of me
yeah I'm not sure about this specific
example but I do think that's happening
yeah
so as somebody pointed out
a Critic
that all I really did was pick topics
that other people had seen as common
sense
and then Common Sense usually wins and
so all I did was spot some common sense
things early and talk about them
so it's not influenced it's just I saw a
parade forming stood in front of the
parade
and I just you know made it look like I
was in charge of the parade
the the only counter I would put to that
is that
all of those things I talked about were
Common Sense before I talked about them
they were common sense for a long time
it didn't make any difference
didn't make any difference
Common Sense doesn't move anybody
you need persuasion
so there is there is a coincidence
between when I applied public persuasion
and when those things started to change
you cannot rule out coincidence you
can't rule out coincidence and you can't
rule out well it wouldn't be coincidence
you can't rule out that I'm looking at
the wrong pattern
it could be that the pattern isn't just
good at spotting winners
how could you rule that out how could
you rule out that I'm just good at
spotting winners in advance
because I do believe I am but I think I
am pretty good as spotting winners
yeah so here's the only credit I will
take unambiguously
which is if you're good at spotting
winners
and then you can productively be part of
that persuasion
then you're you know you're part of a
very large team of people who are trying
to push things in the right direction so
that that's the credit I would take the
credit I would take
is that I've been early pushing useful
things that Americans are better off
with
that's the only thing I can say for sure
um let us know when you buy a new stock
yeah I would now say that my stock
buying skills are anything you should
emulate
the pattern supports the Christian end
of days prediction well the other thing
that that fits is that we always think
the world is going to hell
so if there had never been any Christian
predictions about the end of times we
would still be talking about everything
going to hell because that's just what
we do it just means you're humans
tell us what stock I'm selling I sold my
Apple stock
because I'm I don't think that apple
um
is going to easily navigate the AI era
because AI is almost a full replacement
for your smartphone
and I don't know what they do about that
because even if they make their own you
know best AI smartphone ever
it won't be that better than everybody
else's will it
you think you're going to buy back Apple
you know betting against me is is not
crazy
you know betting the opposite of me is
probably would probably make you money
in the long run
Vanguard I believe correct me if I'm
wrong but Vanguard is
low ESG
compliance right
they're they're not in ESG investing
company
yeah so I think Vanguard was in the top
two I believe maybe number two in being
unaffected by ESG and just putting their
investments in where it makes sense
yeah
um
and stay out of stocks
Vanguard is the main owner of BlackRock
now
that doesn't sound right you mean it the
other way around don't you
Vanguard probably does have ESG funds
because everybody would have one
but I think that they also have a
non-esg fund
that they own each other
all right
is there a big story that I missed of
the hospital Karen story there's well
the hospital Karen story was exactly
what I said
two people who legitimately thought that
they that the bike was theirs
and that was the whole story
and that's what I saw from the start
because you know unless you're a racist
I saw two people who believed that they
owned a bike I didn't say they color in
that story at all
did you see color in that story I didn't
see a Karen and I didn't see a black guy
in that story although that's the way it
was presented it's like a black guy in a
carrot I didn't see the black guy
meaning that he wasn't acting
like in some way that's like only black
people act he was just a guy who thought
it was his bike
and he was he was not taking no for an
answer and he wasn't well he wasn't
being physically scary was he
and I think he thought he was a victim
and she was defending her rights
I don't know I ended up liking both of
them
is that wrong I think we're supposed to
not like both of them
right like that that's what the media
narrative is how about you don't like
both of them or one of them why don't
you like one of them and dislike the
other one I refuse
I I absolutely refuse I like both of
them
a nurse who's you know probably an angel
pregnant nurse I'm totally on her side
guy guy who innocently believes
somebody's taking his bike that he paid
for totally on his side too I could be
on both of their sides there there's no
conflict with that I can support both of
them they were just in a bad situation
uh I I hope they go on to happy lives
the U-Haul truck the White House that
feels like a crazy guy thing that that
was too disjointed to even be any kind
of an Intel operation or you know
Russian op or anything that that just
had crazy guy written all over it
no we we know for sure
well at least the reporting is that both
of them had a reason to think that they
owned the bike like a good reason
and one of them was just wrong but they
they had some reason
um
if you saw an extremely pregnant woman
you would let her have the bike well not
if you thought you would just paid for
it
because I don't think anybody's saying
there were no other bikes am I right
it's not like she couldn't go somewhere
there was just a question of whether
he'd pay for her bike you know and he
was a young guy do you think this young
guy had extra money that he could just
buy somebody else a bike ride
you're wrong Scott about what
right
the Covington response is the story well
I agree the the Covington response was
that the the first reaction of the story
was misleading totally so yes it is a
Covington story you're right
um
whoa and there is your Patriot squirrel
says Scott I never get did get to thank
you and president Trump for saving my
life
I was strung out on heroin for 20 years
started my recovery in 2016 have been
clean for four years
happy as hell
good for you that that's the story that
I like better than any other story
anytime somebody tells me that they got
off drugs
or got off alcohol
or just built their talent stack and got
a better job
I could I could hear that all day long
because that's what we're here for
so one of the things
here's a little business advice
I heard this a long time ago that you
don't decide what your product is the
the customers decide
so if you think you're selling
um Pez dispensers but your audience
thinks you're an auction site although
that that's not a real story but I'll
use it anyway
um
then you become an auction site
so your customers tell you are and that
that certainly happened with Dilbert
with Dilbert the audience said hey we
like this office comic
and I would say it's not an office comic
he just goes to work sometimes but it's
not really about the office
and then people would say yeah we love
the office comic and I would say stop
saying that it's a general comment I can
do any kind of topic I want
and then the audience would say yeah but
you really should do the
the office ones they're the ones we like
so I changed it into an office comic
strip
yeah
um
and that's how you do it that's that's
why it was successful it wasn't
successful dilber wasn't until I gave
the audience what they told me I was
selling they told me I was selling that
before I sold it I just wasn't even
selling that product and they said
thanks for that product and I said what
and now I make that product and
everybody's happy
so likewise with the live streaming what
I thought I was presenting
was you know some entertainment that
people would watch for an hour or
whatever
but what I'm quickly learning is that
some kind of a
I don't know if Community is the right
word but but there's sort of some sort
of non-traditional
support group
that got accidentally formed through the
just normal interactions of of uh
whatever this is and one of the weirdest
outcomes is the number of people who
quit alcohol
or got off drugs
and there's a number of people who have
helped each other
so it's not just an audience it's an
audience that is literally involved in
the betterment of the other members of
the audience
which is unexpected so I certainly did
not create I did not start out to say oh
I'll create an audience where
everybody's trying to help each other it
becomes like a virtual
support group
wasn't my plan
but it happened
like that's that's basically a big part
of my audience is people who are here
for the other people in the audience
as well as you know I'm an organizing
principal but I didn't see that coming
there's no way you could have planned
that or I don't think you could have
made it happen I don't think you could
have pushed it to happen it just sort of
evolved that way
so when I see that comment somebody who
got off heroin changed their life you're
not the only one
and a lot of it has to do with the fact
that people feel some common support
and then when I say things that
are let's say useful
it gets reinforced by the other people
who say yes that's useful and then I
think it makes it more powerful so
effectively it creates like a peer
influence
that's positive
because your your peers and sense or you
know the other people who are in the
audience and if the other people in the
audience are happy with you
um
quitting drugs as you saw you couldn't
you couldn't see the reaction on YouTube
you couldn't see the reaction in the
locals platform but they were delighted
just delighted that there's somebody
here
had changed their life
and it was hard but it but it worked out
we all want to hear that so more of that
if anybody else has any winning stories
bring that up next time and we'll call
you out happy birthday to Frank gonna
say goodbye to YouTube
and talk to you tomorrow thanks for
joining
