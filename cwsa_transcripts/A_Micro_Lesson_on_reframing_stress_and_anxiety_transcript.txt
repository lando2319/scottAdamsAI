okay here's a micro lesson on how to
handle anxiety and stress through
reframing now reframing is simply
looking at things in a different way and
a reframe doesn't need to be true in any
kind of scientific way all you're trying
to do is put the focus in your mind on
one area as opposed to another for good
result you'll see how that works through
as i work through some examples
number one
number one reframe is don't think about
your problems at the moment
say to yourself how much are you going
to care about any of this on your
deathbed
and how many things from even say a year
ago that bothered you
still bother you today
just think about the long run imagine
yourself literally on your deathbed and
what are you thinking at the end of your
life
are you thinking about that little
slight you had at the office
probably not so why worry about it now
now you say to yourself but scott that's
easy to say
that's the point it's just the repeating
of it in your mind
as if it were true
that makes the circuitry in your brain
start to uh take form in a way that will
make you think that maybe it doesn't
matter in other words you can talk
yourself into almost anything through
repetition
it doesn't doesn't even have to be
something that your
rational brain thinks is true
you can still talk yourself into it if
it's useful
number two
forget about removing bad thoughts can't
be done
you can't subtract thoughts
as soon as you think you can you get in
this loop where you keep trying to
subtract them and you just keep thinking
about them
instead
add things to your mental shelf space
until your shelf is so full of other
stuff
that is just crowding out the other
thoughts you can't subtract a thought
don't even try
you can only add thoughts and they can
over time
be more interesting and more provocative
and more absorbing and and then minimize
the thing that had been bothering you
once you've minimized it it'll take care
of itself
think of
social media not so much as that hobby
that thing you like to do in your spare
time don't think of it as entertainment
think of it as a vampire that exists to
suck the energy and attention out of you
for
somebody else's financial benefit
now is that true again a reframe doesn't
have to be technically true it doesn't
have to be the only way to look at it it
just has to be true enough that your
brain is willing to
let's say deal with that thought
until it sort of becomes true and you
start thinking i don't want to have a
vampire sucking my energy
i think i'll do something else the less
time you spend on social media the less
anxiety the less stress you'll have
control the controllable
you've heard this before in different
forms there are some things you simply
can't control if you just worry about
well everything's going to go to heck
because because there are a whole bunch
of things i can't control you're going
to feel stressed and anxious all the
time instead you'll find that as a good
technique for controlling how you feel
control the hell out of everything you
can control
that would include things like your
fitness your diet your sleep and we'll
talk about that in a moment so anything
in your life that isn't hard coded
such as the dna you were born with
control the heck out of it and watch how
much better you feel
about your life because controlling the
controllable
always works you're going to get a
better result if you do it
number five one of my all-time favorites
do you ever come home from work or
you're just feeling anxious or stressed
if you do tell yourself hey that's not
stress
that's not
anxiety that's energy i got too much
energy my heart's beating out of my my
chest my my pulse is too hard too much
energy
use it
use your energy and match it with the
thing that's perfectly suited for a
person who has too much energy
exercise
whenever you feel stressed tell yourself
man i'm going to have a good workout
today
is it the only thing that's true no
doesn't matter reframes work anyway just
make it a little bit of a
loop or a mantra in your head every time
you feel that stress say wow i could
lift a lot today
i've been using this for years it works
incredibly well
one of the best ones
criticism a lot of us get stressed out
or anxious that other people are
criticizing us maybe in their heads
maybe they're thinking bad thoughts
about us somewhere
the way to think about that is that
criticism is not something that's
touching you
it's not on you it's not
it's not anywhere near you
is literally
a chemical reaction that's happening in
the stranger's skull
and that stranger isn't even in the room
usually
and so ask yourself how much should you
be bothered by a minuscule chemical
reaction on the other side of the planet
or the other side of town even
reverse it if that's not good enough
ask yourself
how much are other people bothered
by a thought you had in your head that
you did not share
not too bothered are they because they
don't even know it's there
they might imagine you have a bad
thought but that's different
so
whenever you feel that people are
thinking poorly of you it might be true
we'll get to that in a second but
probably it isn't probably they just
don't care and if they did care it would
just be a tiny chemical reaction in the
brain of a stranger or just somebody
who's not in the room
learn to like embarrassment number seven
and that's something you can learn with
practice the dale carnegie course goes
directly at this they put you in
embarrassing situations in front of your
classmates until
you realize that they just hear and say
well that was a good job dealing with
that embarrassing situation
and pretty soon you
think
via repetition even though there's no
logic to it you start thinking wow
embarrassing situations are kind of fun
everybody gives me attention i didn't
really get hurt
everybody talks about me they have a
story about me
cool
i can't tell you how many insanely
embarrassing situations i've been in
both as a public figure and privately do
any of them bother me at the moment
nope
none and it's not because i'm awesome
this stuff used to bother me a lot
i just learned through practice to put
myself in lots of embarrassing
situations such as the one i'm in right
now
what will people say about this video
i don't know
doesn't bother me won't stop me a bit uh
so learn to like embarrassment don't
just tolerate it you can actually
literally
get to liking it i'm already there it's
a real thing
a b test everything that you're you're
working on so whatever you're working on
for your stress your anxiety don't think
that if the first three things you tried
didn't give you a result that you're
done no no this is a lifetime process
you're never done you're never done and
we'll talk about that more too
number nine ego is the enemy
if you're thinking oh i don't want to do
that because i'll get embarrassed oh if
i do that i might get hurt you know you
don't want to do things that are too
dangerous but a lot of things you you
don't do because you're timid
that timidness is your ego trying to
protect itself
why are you trying to protect it
reframe it
it is more accurate to say that your ego
is your enemy
it's preventing you from talking to
people you'd like to talk to it's
preventing you from asking that person
on a date it's preventing you from
making the first move it's preventing
you from going for the next job your ego
is your worst enemy in the world kill
that
thing
some people do it with mushrooms i don't
recommend that or any other drug
because i'm not a doctor i'm just giving
you some background information
other people kill their ego by learning
to like embarrassment
other people kill it by being successful
enough in something
that even if they're terrible at a
different thing well you're still tiger
woods
right now maybe that's going a little
too far but if you're good at anything
it will protect you
against things you're not good at so
find something you can just do more than
other people because that's usually what
it takes to be the good one could be
anything play tennis play pool uh bird
watch whatever it is just do it more
than other people you'll be one of the
good ones and then when you're one of
the bad ones that's something else
you'll say to yourself well
somebody else put more time into it
because they cared about
that
more than i cared if i had put as much
time into it as bob i'd be just as good
as that at that thing as bob and how do
i know that for sure
because when i put time into the thing i
like i got pretty good at it
so you need some experience at getting
good at stuff and do that even if it's
only for mental purposes
now here is perhaps the one takeaway
that is the most important of all if
there's only one thing you're going to
remember remember this
stress reduction
and anxiety reduction
are your full-time job
you're never done
it's the most important thing you need
to do because this is the key that opens
up the rest of your life
if you don't take care of your your
anxiety and stress
all of the other goodness of life will
be
let's say less available to you and i
think you know it that's why you're
watching this
right so never quit never stop never
stop pushing this is a full-time job
forever
and the parts of it that you need a
system for and when i say you need a
system for it i'm not trying to sell my
book right now but it just happens to be
exactly the content that matches this i
had failed almost everything and still
win big uh has been a big influence on a
lot of other books and on business and
it's because it teaches you how to make
your own system not something i'm
telling you to do but how to create a
system that works for you individually
very easily for all the things that
matter to your anxiety and your stress
your sleep your diet your fitness and
also i'm going to add your
detection
if you can tell what is a real thing to
be afraid of and what is a phantom
something that you could have been
afraid of but you know it's
you learn to have a better
detection
uh system and that also is in my book
had it failed almost everything and
still went big
you have a system for acquiring skills i
call it a skill stack that's also in the
book and it means putting together
skills that work well together it
doesn't mean being number one in the
world and one thing it means combining
things to make yourself sort of a joe
rogan somebody who can do a bunch of
things really well
but what makes him special is that the
combination just works powerfully
learn how to network have a system for
it it's something you can learn if it
doesn't work the first time a b test try
something else you should find a system
for your social life
as well as your business life in the
social life what i mean by that is find
a way that you will always be around new
people or the people you like they
already know could be that you join a
sport
and you meet the people who do that
could be you get more involved in the
school and you meet the other parents of
whatever but have a system for it don't
don't just wonder why you don't have
friends
do something do a thing that puts you in
contact with a lot of people join a
church it'll be obvious what to do but
don't not have a system for it because
that goes directly to stress reduction
and anxiety you need social you need
people they help get in nature science
confirms this
all the time and
you can test this in five minutes take a
walk
when when you're stressed just get
outside around some trees
see how you feel in five minutes it's
immediate
this is a really big one and it hits you
right away this will take down your
stress
and a change of scenery in general now
people are different in how much
change of scenery they need i tend to
live in my head so i don't need as much
to change the scenery as other people
but even i
can feel the stress disappear when i'm
in a completely new place that's also
comfortable
those are your tips
for
reducing your anxiety and your stress
it's a full-time job
a b test it forever until you've got
something that's really working for you
i guarantee this will help
and that is your micro lesson for the
day
