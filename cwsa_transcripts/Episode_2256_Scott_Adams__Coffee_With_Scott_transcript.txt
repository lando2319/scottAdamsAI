good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
although to be fair human civilization
is not doing the greatest job for itself
lately I think you'd
agree if you're watching me on any of
the following platforms X or YouTube or
Rumble right now I'm testing out a new
separate camera how's my camera how's my
lighting
good well I hope so well today if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody could even imagine
and that includes the
swaddling I recommend that during these
trying times when the news is very
stressful they get out here ideally it
could be a blad blet but it doesn't have
to
and you swaddle yourself so that we're
all simultaneously
swaddling at the same time we do the
simultaneous sip oh it'll help you think
it won't help it'll help it'll help a
lot and all you need for the
simultaneous sip is a CPP muger glass a
tanker chel sign a canteen Jer flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure of
the dope me of the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
wow that actually was delicious better
than
usual well I would like to give you the
reframe of the day we'll of course talk
about Israel and the hard news but I
like to warm up with some
appetizers reframe of the day I saw this
now it comes from my new book reframe
your brain it's just one example all the
reframes are completely different and in
different topics so don't make a
generalization about it but uh Daniel
Rusty tweets this he says uh new book
refrain new new book reframe your brain
and then he tells this reframe that he
liked quote and this is from me uh doing
what you're told gets you a paycheck
doing what you're not told but is useful
gets you
promoted now the idea is that if you
just do a real good job at the things
you're supposed to do well then you look
like somebody deserves a promotion but
if you do what you're supposed to do
plus you notice some things that need to
be done that are even maybe above your
pay grade but they just need to be done
and they're unaddressed do those do
those too and you will find that you
were immediately the person they think
of when they're thinking of promotion
now I saw some push back somebody said
Scott Scott Scott I don't think you
understand the real world of work okay
right there I should have blocked them
but I read on you don't understand that
what would happen in the real world is
if you did something that was not your
job your boss would uh yell at you for
doing something that's not in your job
description and somebody else has a
budget and a paycheck to do it and
you're just doing their job and you're
just duplicating work Scott so how about
that to which I
say I always make the following
assumption with my reframes
that you're not a freaking idiot because
if you were an idiot then the extra
stuff you would do would be things that
are other people's jobs that they're
paid to
do that's not exactly the suggestion no
the suggestion is there's something that
nobody's doing and you could do it so
you do it and that ladies and gentlemen
is how you stand out at work if you're
only doing what you're asked to do
you're not going anywhere You' better
figure out what you can do this that's
extra right you think of your job as
marketing it's not even about the thing
that you do it's about the marketing of
yourself and that's your reframe your
reframe is doing what you're told gets
you paycheck doing more than you're told
might get you more than more than a
paycheck well we learned a little bit
more about the Tik Tock band that's
never going to be a ban that seemed like
it was going to happen for a while and
now it seems like there's no way it's
going to
happen um Laura Ingram she tweeted that
it's because of Chinese money flooding
Capitol
Hill I think that's obvious know you
what else could it be except Chinese
money flooding The
Zone well uh Politico has an article and
that's why uh Laura Ingram was
commenting on it and the political art
article this this is not an
allegation this is just an impression
right so I don't know it's true I only
know what impression I'm getting the
impression I'm getting is that China
wrote this article now they didn't
obviously but it's written
like Chinese propaganda basically and
here's politico's uh long
explanation for why the Tik Tock band
has not been implemented are you ready
for this it's rather
detailed but you know you need to hear
the other side and it goes like this so
the reason that the Tic Tac ban has not
been approved even though it even though
it had bipartisan support So this wasn't
one of those partisan ones this had
bipartisan support but it didn't happen
and there are good reasons for it let's
see the good reasons are
uh um things and uh processes there's no
law and a thing in a person and then
they talk to somebody who may have felt
something about the uh
I don't know the Constitutional legal
the standards the the also the uh the
president and the uh politics and okay
there's no
reason that let me
summarize Politico just did this big
complicated thing to make you think
there are reasons there are no
reasons except for what Laura said which
is it must be Chinese money what else
can it be you it it is such word salad
when you read well there's this you know
there's this law from 30 years ago that
says you shouldn't ban information from
foreign countries to which I Say
Never Never there there's nothing that
could have changed that would make that
a different situation as in a weaponized
app do you think when they made the
ruling about not Banning information
from other countries do you think that
they were thinking about a weaponized
brainwashing app no no what would it
take for the commander-in-chief to ban
something that was a military asset
nothing it's the
commander-in-chief they just say this is
dangerous to the country I ban it and
then fight it out in court but you ban
it first you don't you don't fight it
out first it's a military asset you ban
it first and then you see if you
followed the law so now the country is
not being run for the benefit of the
country whatever is happening here it's
for the benefit of China there is no
feasible conceivable argument that this
is good for the United States and by the
way that's a bipartisan
opinion right so you know it's about
people being bought off
essentially well Mike Lindell says he
will keep fighting in his lawsuit he's
being sued by the Dominion and smart
atic people apparently he has at least
the option I guess you always have the
option of trying to do a settlement that
would be super super devastating and
expensive or he could fight it out and
bankrupt his company which is you know
likely he decided he's going to fight it
out and bankrupt his company now I don't
know if that's a good idea or a bad idea
he's the only one who can judge that but
I wouldn't want to get in too much of a
fight with Mike Lindell because this guy
doesn't quit he just doesn't quit yeah I
I weirdly respect it even if it's the
wrong decision I kind of like his fight
right I don't know if he's right I have
no idea if he's right or wrong but I do
like his fight he clearly believes he's
right and he's going to bet it
all he's actually just going to bet it
all now I'm sure he saved up a few bucks
so he's not going to go to the poor
house but that's a pretty big sacrifice
to sacrifice your company and it looks
like he's willing to do it but here's a
question that I have I've never seen
anybody address
this how can dominion and
smartmatic Sue Mike Lindell for being
wrong about his claims about the
election
unless they make their code
public how how does this work how in the
world can they sue him with his claim
would presumably I would assume that his
claims would include some allegations
about what happens with the code you
know the actual programming
code isn't that part of it now maybe
that's not part of the claim maybe the
claim has something you know independent
so you don't have to look at it but I
would think that would be the most
logical way this goes right the most
logical way is that his lawyers get to
see the code and he would have experts
to be able to look look at it and see if
there's anything wrong now I don't think
there's any way that these companies can
reveal their code because forget about
even whether there's something you know
that they need to cover up I don't have
any reason to believe that
but it seems like it'd be proprietary at
the very least they wouldn't want to
release it for competitive reasons so I
don't know how he
loses can does anybody I'm not a
lawyer but I don't we see how you lose
if the main piece of evidence you're not
willing to share for political reason or
for competitive reasons so I don't think
he's going to be able to you know show
that any uh bad things happened but he
might be able to show that the case
can't go forward that's just the guess I
don't
know all right speaking of things I
don't know much about Jonathan Turley
says that there's new new stuff coming
up out with the Biden crime failing
situation and so Turley tweets that uh
newly released evidence reveals over 20
million dollar coming from 23 separate
countries on four continents to at least
nine Biden family
members and then he says not only are
the Biden transfers becoming clear so is
the Biden Family Tree in this lucrative
form of
corruption now if you were to read this
out of context
you would say to yourself some form of
this oh my
God they they totally have the goods on
the Biden crime family man they're in
trouble now
right right they're in big trouble
now except do we really live in a
world in which the evidence is going to
matter in this
case if we were if it were you or me I
think the EV evidence would matter a lot
but do we really think it's going to
matter in this
case my guess is no my guess is it won't
matter at all what do you
think I feel as if it do it'll make no
difference how how much direct evidence
there is because the other side will
simply say there was no direct
evidence and then you'll say but but
here it is like right here look look
direct evidence and they'll say well I
got to go and then tomorrow they'll come
back and say well there was no direct
evidence you know no no evidence to
correct connecting JY
Drive let check something for a minute
here all right just making sure my
camera is
working I think I gonna have to change
that camera orientation because I have
to look up to see
it all right well anyway uh all the
other news got wiped off the map because
of the situation in
Israel
and
um that's not the only news that got
wiped out did anybody wake up this
morning and say to themselves I don't
think I can spend another minute looking
at
atrocities because it seemed like all
the videos were about
atrocities and I woke up this
morning atrocity is
gone did you notice that
did anybody notice that all the videos
of the atrocities are
gone I'm not saying that's good or bad
it's an
observation yeah and I'm not too
surprised because um there weren't that
many different videos so I think the
social media networks could focus in on
getting the ones a number of them were
fake right so there was one video uh
that purported to show some high ranking
Israeli being captured by the
Palestinians and that was not even from
wasn't even the same country yeah it was
a fake video from another
country uh you can still see the videos
on telegram yeah um but it does tell you
that the the
media let's say the media monster
including social media have made a
decision about how much to inflame the
emotions of the viewers
and you could easily predict that there
would be a blackout of
news here's why because the next
phase is going to be terrible like the
first phase
was I mean almost terrible on a level
that's hard to
imagine you know unless you're thinking
World War II
levels
but for what uh for what Israel needs to
do next and has already said they would
do which is go into Gaza and take over
apparently Gaza is booby trapped and I
mean it would just be the hardest door
toor fighting you could ever have and
Israel certainly not wanted to do
it but you're not going to see any of
that on
video um presumably lots of video will
be taken because they have cameras and
whatnot but I think Israel's already
turned off the electricity and
water so Gaza already has no electricity
and water I don't know how they're
getting
food right and you could expect that the
Bloodshed will be extreme you know when
when Israel moves in they're already
bombing so there's already Bloodshed but
not as much as it's going to be it's
going to be a lot worse
and it seems to me and I'll tell you why
in a minute that Israel needed to U and
their allies needed to just turn off the
news because what happens next they're
not going to want on the
news so yeah one half of the population
of Gaza is children did you know that
50% of the entire population of Gaza are
children how do you think they're being
raised do you think they're being
radicalized well if they weren't being
radicalized I'm sure they were but if
they weren't they are now I mean if they
weren't before they certainly are now
what do you do
with a million children because there
about two million in Gaza so there are
something like a million children who
have been raised to be almost weapons to
hate
Israel and what do you do about
it and what do you do about that you
would have to control their school
systems and retrain them as best you
could you'd have to control the news and
control the schools and you would have
to shut down anything that was trading
people differently so the level of
change that Israel would have to
introduce is just going to look like a
prison
camp right they would have to remove
pretty much all freedom to even in order
for Israel to be safe they would have to
remove most freedom from Gaza because
the gazin have been
propagandized and and by the way I'm not
making an opinion of who's good or bad
or right or wrong
in case you're picking it up if you're
like oh I think he's Pro this or anti
that I'm trying not to be because my
opinion is that as bad as these current
things are it's a complicated place and
it's easy to tell the story and forget
to leave out you know this group did
something bad to the other group what
about that thing a 100 years ago and
you're forgetting the thing 2,000 years
ago but what about the
1940s but what about 1970s
right so when you talk about that area
unless you say everything that both
sides have done that's shitty to each
side nobody's going to take you
seriously so I'm just going to blanketly
say bad people have done bad things but
I'm looking at what what's happening at
the
moment all
right so here are some uh things we
know uh the news is telling us that Iran
their intelligence people uh or security
people helped uh Hamas plan the attack
and that they met with him in Beirut
with senior members of Hezbollah and
Hamas which would suggest that
Hezbollah is backing it but might back
it more militarily in the
future now that's the news now let me
ask you this what was the
source you all heard that news if you're
paying attention you've already heard
that what was the
source do you remember seeing any Source
how would we know that that meeting
happened we're in the middle of a war in
in a way we're all in the middle of it
we're in the middle of a war and an
anonymous source told you something
that's right on the
nose middle of a war that's a bit strong
signal for everything being a lie right
on the nose this is your second signal
for everything being a
lie
right so and then so War anonymous
source right on the
nose those are three signals for a
lie
but don't you think it's directionally
true don't you think aan has supported
himas in a military way here's my best
guess my best guess is that the story is
fake but that it's true enough meaning
that maybe there was no specific meaning
in
Beirut that included those
parties but it would be really good
military for to tell people that they
knew about a specific meeting in a
specific place with a spefic specific
set of
attendees because if you tell the story
that way then the public goes whoa I
thought it was just a rumor but
apparently you you actually know about
the people in the room okay so I believe
in
now more likely we we have a certainty
that Iran is behind
it and somebody made up a narrative that
fits the certainty that we all held my
guess is it's
 but not not the general idea
the general idea is true I guess my my
best understanding is that Iran is
behind at least the funding and you know
probably a lot of the
planning but was there that one specific
meeting that was key to it
all I'm going to say no I'm going to say
more likely no than yes but that it got
you to the right place it took your head
to the right place but probably with a a
path that wasn't quite
complete all right so here are some of
the things uh that I've learned uh I saw
one opinion piece that
says uh well let me just give you this
background first did you know that the
Hamas Charter so the charter of the
organization from 1988 hasn't changed
apparently calls for Islam to quote
obliterate
Israel did you know that it's actually
the written part of the charter
generally speaking if somebody has that
written in their Charter that they're
going to destroy you that's a free punch
you can do anything to that group you
can murder them
all torture them all nobody gives a
what once you've declared your intention
to do a holocaust on a demographic group
you know they're talk about Israel the
country but really it's pretty close to
just a
holocaust um once you've declared your
intention the people that you that are
the potential you know victims of that
they could do anything there there are
no restrictions on what they can do once
that is the stated opinion now I'm not
saying they should I'm not recommending
any particular kind of violence or
anything um I'm just saying that their
moral
and I guess just moral standing is 100%
they can do anything they want
uh whether it makes sense to do that is
another story now here are all the uh
interesting speculations about uh Israel
Hamas Russia and Ukraine because we all
think it might be related this big
military-industrial thing might be all
one one big
thing so here are some things that will
help you decide that first of all
Iran um is not exactly it's not obvious
who they back in the Ukraine Russia
situation because they provided drones
to Russia so you would say oh they're
they're Russian you know Russian allies
they gave them
drones but they probably sold them right
so they made money so maybe it was just
money because they don't care where
they're used but I also understand that
Iran's point of view is that Crimea
belongs to
Ukraine I I'll need a fact check on that
but I read that this morning is that
true that Iran backs Ukraine's ownership
of Crimea which is currently in Russian
hands because that would be as close as
you could be to the opposite of an ally
of Russia so it looks is it looks
like Iran is trying to play it both ways
in other words one foot in Ukraine one
foot in Russia so that they could you
know pivot in either action as their
interests require so that's the first
thing now I would look for a fact check
on the Crimea part but it's not it's not
like a clean out
Alliance all right um the other thing
is um there's rumors that weapons that
were meant for Ukraine are ending up
with
Hamas is that proven does anybody think
that the Ukraine weapons are ending up
with
Hamas I don't think so because I can't
unless you know unless they got diverted
before they got to Ukraine somehow I
don't know how that would happen so
there might be something criminal
happening but I could say for sure
zalinski would not be in favor of giving
weapons to Hamas because they need all
the weapons they can get so if in fact
it's happening there's nobody in
Ukrainian leadership who wants it to
happen I guarantee that
so but maybe you know weapons are pretty
fungible you know one rifle looks like
another rifle so anything could happen
in the arms trade and Anything Could
Happen
anywhere um I saw one rumor with no no
belief that is true that
uh um Israel may have given away 80% of
its artillery to
Ukraine I guess they would have had to
do that that quietly if they did it I
don't know I don't think I believe that
I don't believe that they secretly gave
away 80% of their
artillery so I'm gonna say I'm G to call
BS on that doesn't doesn't feel
true I mean it's possible but I'm going
to call BS on
that uh I also saw a tweet today that uh
there was a known Iranian spiry ring in
the OB Obama
administration know even naming names is
that a real
thing what do we know as as to today do
we know actually that there was an
Iranian spiry ring as part of the Obama
Administration are you sure that's not
just a right-wing
story has any left leading publication
confirmed
that yeah I see your comments but I
don't I think you're well
yeah all right I'm not going to name the
the names you're naming all
right I don't know if that's true see it
seems like it could be but I don't know
enough about it to have an
opinion all
right um here is my big opinion of the
day if you're ready for it are you ready
for the big opinion of the
day um the first thing you should know
is that I am no expert on the Middle
East can we all agree on that
I I like it I like to see your agreement
that whatever I say about the Middle
East you should put that in your you
know grain of salt idiot who doesn't
know anything opinions all right so if
we can agree that I have no credibility
in this domain and I'm on the same page
then you don't need to remind me of it
I'm just doing it to save you time
because I know the NPCs are already
spinning like as soon as I said I was
going to give you a big opinion the the
NPCs were like oh I can't wait to sound
in on this I'm going to say something
about you not knowing enough about the
region
oh so I know you're right on the edge of
orgasm sort of an NPC orgasm because you
see the the low hanging fruit coming
don't you like in your mind you're
imagining oh that fruit is going to be
lwh hanging the moment he weighs it on
this oh cartoonist let's listen to the
cartoonist I've got my sarcasm ready oh
I'm going to unload on him it's going to
be
delightful so that's that's how I
imagine it now now that we've completely
discredited me and I think that was
appropriate I'd like to discredit
everybody
else so who saw this attack
coming now I know you're all going to
say you did right you're all gonna say
you did oh I knew it was coming no you
didn't but I know the NPCs are going to
say they did saw coming from a mile away
all right so while we can all agree
including me that my opinion is
worthless and should not be taken
seriously I would like to propose that
my opinion is equal to the greatest
experts in the
field also completely worthless
will will you go that far with me that
my opinion is worthless but about equal
to all the other professional opinions
and I will go further equal to all of
the military opinions do you know how
much I know about the
military less than I know about the
Middle
East and I will I will assert that
nobody has any useful opinions over
there it's just all and
guessing and idiots as far as I can tell
that's that's the entire landscape all
right that said now we've got a good
base here I give you my
opinion and NPCs get ready for this lwh
hanging fruit it's going to be
delicious all right I'm just going to
read you my long tweet because I said it
so perfectly uh I said like the rest of
you I'm trying to understand the Hamas
strategy don't you wonder what the hell
they're up to like what when did you
have ever War when you don't know what
this side that started the war even once
I mean other than the destruction of
Israel but does it look like that's
going to happen or that they thought
that was going to happen no there's
something else going on so let me just
read it on the surface it looks insane
there's no real hope of conquering
Israel and no hope it will make anything
better for anyone would you agree so far
there's no hope that they're going to
conquer Israel in the next month right
and there's no hope that it's going to
make anything better for pal
Palestinians indeed it's guaranteed to
make it worse would you agree with those
statements so there's not any obvious
gain so is something else is something
less
obvious um
but Hamas seemed this is my own opinion
Hamas seemed too capable to be dismissed
as crazy people they did Mount a very
successful operation in their you know
evil
domain uh and they Ian handlers you know
whether or not there was a meeting in
Beirut or not you know the Iranians are
involved do the Iranians seem mentally
unfit do they seem incompetent they do
not one of the things we worry about is
the Iranian security people are actually
pretty
capable it's a problem right so if you
have people who are operating like
they're not crazy you know they put
together a successful major
campaign what's going on we can't see
their
objective and they're not just crazy
because crazy people might not have an
objective so if they're not crazy and we
can't see what they're up to what's
going on so I've ruled out making
anything better as an objective would
you agree their objective is not to
Simply get hostages back although they
might it's not just to make some
attention for their cause although
does right but there's nothing
immediately that will get better would
you agree that there's no way the the
people in Hamas were thinking oh by next
Tuesday we'll have a lot of stuff fixed
definitely not making anything better
all right so what else what is going
on um here's what I think if you
eliminate making anything better what's
left and here's what's
left um
you could predict that Israel's response
will necessarily because there's no way
around it create civilian hardships in
Gaza there is likely to shock the
Civilized
World they already turned off the
electricity and water in
Gaza Gaza depends entirely from for for
its food from outside sources in other
words Gaza is entirely supported by the
outside it's like 70% unemployment rate
it's just a basket
case so Israel will have to do something
to uh get control of fas which means
going into Gaza which means that the
Bloodshed and the suffering of the uh
citizens of Gaza who many of them just
wanted to mind their own business and
stay healthy and happy and we're not
doing too well on that but it's going to
look
bad and here's my main point if if that
were to
happen it would decrease Israel's
primary assets what is Israel's biggest
asset the
Holocaust the Holocaust is their biggest
asset now you might say no it's it's
their economy it's their military it's
the land of Israel itself it's the
people you might have lots of different
answers none of them are even close to
the value of the Holocaust
narrative the Holocaust narrative puts
them in the victim role and is so
horrific that all you know good people
say some version of you know never again
because whether you're Jewish or
non-jewish you're pretty committed to
making sure that doesn't happen again
unless you're just the worst person in
the
world so I would say that the mil that
the fact Israel has a country is is
because The Narrative of the Holocaust
the reason they have a good economy is
because they have a country and they
have a good military because they have a
good economy basically 100% of their
other assets depend on at least
historically but also today on the fact
that when you think of Israel you think
of that
narrative
but if Israel can be goated into doing
something so bad to the Gaza uh
residents that observers say to
themselves hey I'm not so sure they were
always the good
guys then then Hamas will have taken
from Israel their biggest
asset which is
psychological
psychological let me go
on um looks to me as if Hamas is playing
a long game step one weaken the
Holocaust narrative and gain more
militant supporters across the region
have they done
that s starting to look like maybe they
are doing
that don't know to what extent but it's
certainly directionally they're getting
something they wanted I
think um and the only price that they'll
have to
pay the Hamas will have to pay is the uh
continued uh pain and death and
suffering of their own
residents
however how were those residents doing
before if you said hey you Americans or
Canadians or Europeans we'd like you to
go from whatever your current lifestyle
is to something closer to
starvation and living without
electricity well we would say um
whatever it is you have to do to avoid
that that do that because I'm not going
back to you know being living in a cave
because there's a gigantic difference
between our current Lifestyles the
average lifestyles in those countries
and what what it could be so we would
try to avoid that at all costs however
if you had a 70% unemployment rate you
had been trained that you're being
oppressed by one group in particular and
on the ground you see evidence of it
like oh I can't travel freely do
anything kind of business I want that
sort of thing and then you're being
propagandized and then you don't have
your Basics like you're struggling for
food every day and you're living in you
know very suboptimal living
conditions under those conditions Hamas
is hoping that if they're taken from a
very bad situation to start with and
then it gets worse it can't get that
much worse there's not enough room like
things were bad in the beginning now
what's likely to happen is that there
will be massive food Aid will be
provided from the
outside so they probably won't
starve probably I can't guarantee that
but they probably won't because I would
imagine lots of countries are gearing up
to make sure they don't starve
already so from the point of view of
Hamas who believes that suffering to get
what they want is just part of their
package it doesn't look like such a big
expense and it looks like they have a
lot to gain if they can take Israel down
a notch in the public opinion and also
you know maybe get some other people
fired up on their side so it doesn't
look crazy from that perspective it just
looks like people doing things far more
extreme than you would because your
lives are
comfortable how extreme would you be if
your life was completely uncomfortable
all the time I mean some of you probably
is you would do a lot more right yeah
you know if I had to feed my family how
extreme would I be to feed my
family almost
anything almost anything so ex extremism
makes sense when people are struggling
it makes a lot less sense when they're
not all right and so
uh I want to tell you what a great
prediction I made uh after it already
happened if there's one advice I can
give you if you'd like to be well known
for um making good predictions predict
things that have already happened so I
made a prediction that I found out was
was happening at actually the same time
I was making the
prediction so here was the
prediction uh that makes Saudi Arabia
the most important player in this drama
when and if they take aside the new
narrative is
formed as I was writing this
tweet at the same time Saudi Arabia was
uh announcing that they were going to
end all negotiations on normalizations
with Israel and they've informed uh
Secretary of State Lincoln that it's
ending on negotiations on normalizing
relations according to the Jerusalem
Post so I G to give myself a little bit
of
credit you know even though I I I ended
up predicting thing that something that
happened half an hour before I predicted
it but it was obvious that is that Saudi
would be the big player now of course
this is related to the Abraham Accords
and the normalization of things so you
assume that Hamas wanted to make sure it
didn't get isolated in the region by
having everybody be chummy with Israel
and having lots of economic highes that
would make it harder for Hamas to
operate so it looks like they won it
looks like Hamas got what they wanted in
the shore run which is to tank the uh
the
deal so not only did Hamas get an
immediate victory of destroying the uh
the warming of relations between Saudi
and
Israel but they get they might get a
longer term win by making Israel look
like an aggressor
far more than people have seen it that
way in the
past yeah so there it is now do you
think the fact that we heard a story
with uh questionable truth that um Iran
had actually
met with Hamas and and
Hezbollah it all makes sense now right
you can see that all of this is gearing
up to attack back
Iran th this is the beginning of a war
with Iran it can't go any other
way because you know what Israel can't
allow to
happen the leadership of Iran to still
be alive a year from
now it's not an option
anymore that's what I
think um in my
opinion Israel will have to take out the
leadership of
Iran I think they'll first take care of
business with Hamas and once once they
get on top of it sometime between now
and the end of the year there's going to
be some explody things happening in Iran
and it's going to be over now it might
make things much much worse but they
don't have a choice at this point the
current system the current system
guarantees Israel's destruction in
time Israel is pretty good at long range
planning right Hamas is pretty good at
longrange planning it seems but Israel
is good too and there is no way they're
going to allow Iran to get nuclear
weapons so that they can continue
funding Israel's enemies forever with
impunity they have to take them down
before their nukes are operational we've
had this whole narrative about oh
they're going to break out any day any
day Iran's going to be nuclear at the
same time we have the narrative that
they just funded an active War an actual
invasion with you know hundreds if not
thousands of uh victims on the Israeli
side if you put those two stories
together Iran's getting close to a
nuclear breakout at the same time that
they're funding a war in in Israel
Israel doesn't have a
choice they have to take out the
leadership of
Iran am I the only person who said that
directly as it was coming out of my
mouth I was thinking I haven't heard
anybody say that directly
but I don't think there's any other
choice oh as uh Jack said
it so my my statement I want to I want
to be very clear about my statement I'm
not recommending
it I'm not I'm not joyous about it I'm
not celebrating
it we are simply looking at a set of
facts that guarantees
it and Israel will never have a better
opportunity because at the moment public
opin is on their side at least outside
of the Middle
East and if they wait it'll be too late
you know Iran will have
nukes
and may I further suggest that America
thinks it's the right time
too why because Iran was helping
Russia and so now you have a Ukrainian
reason you have a Ukrainian reason to
attack Iran you have a nuclear breakout
reason and now you have the supporting
Hamas
reason are we done war with Iran is
guaranteed and it's guaranteed this year
there isn't any way around
it but I hope I hope it's limited to the
leadership I don't know if anybody's
everever pulled that off when was the
last time somebody took out the
leadership of a
country and that settled things does
that ever happen because you have to
still because otherwise they just get
replaced with their supporters who are
even
worse do you mean
2024 yeah you know this would be the
best thing that Biden could do is lose
the
election except I don't think Israel is
going to wait that long I think Biden's
going to have to be part of the
solution so this will be a a good test
of whether Biden is his own
person because you could imagine that
Biden would not naturally be on board
with attacking Iran because that would
be very different from anything that's
come
before but if he does
anyway what would you assume about who
is controlling
Biden you might say to yourself he's not
his own person you might say to himself
that Ukraine wants um Iran to be taken
out so maybe Ukraine has control over
him you might say that the uh the Jewish
Lobby in the United States presumably
getting very active because that's what
they're
for uh might be persuasive it might
persuade Congress and the president to
do something that they would ordinarily
be you know unlikely to
do so
I looked into who is funding Gaza
because that's a big question here so
just to give you some numbers so you can
kind understand the landscape so there
are fewer than two million people living
in Gaza which around two million half of
them are children as I said so that's
that's your
demographics and then how much money are
they getting and from
whom um well from lots of places Germany
actually is one of the people funding um
the Palestinians
so Germany is funding people who in part
are destroying uh trying to destroy
Israel and kill Jews that's not a good
look for Germany they might rethink that
all right so here are some numbers these
are 2021 numbers but they're probably
not too far off the United States has
provided over half a billion in
assistant uh more than 400 million in
the humanitarian Aid uh 75 million in
support through some other us thing and
a bunch of coid stuff so from 2014 to
2020 un agencies spent 4.5 billion so it
looks to me like it's in the billion or
two per year between what all the
Europeans and the UN is doing which is
funded by the Europeans and us and what
US is doing directly then there's
cutter uh that's given money there but
basically we're in the low looks like
one or two one or two billion a year
here from a variety of
places um but do you think that they're
going to keep getting
that who's going to keep giving him
money after
today I don't
know
um here this this seems like it's
unrelated but everything's related so
Governor Nome with the worst timing I've
ever seen in politics tweets yesterday
we just passed a resolution called
calling for a constitutional amendment
on guns in
California
seriously the entire news
landscape shows armed men with guns
running through residential places
shooting civilians who have what what
are the civilians armed with B
all yeah they're armed with their
fingers right
apparently you can get a gun in Israel
but it's a hard hard process and you're
only going to get one and it's going to
be a
pistol that's it I mean they have really
good gun
control now maybe they need that gun
control because they also have you know
a lot of people in their population that
might be you know
tempted but at the moment it's looking
like the biggest mistake in the world
because people with guns are just wildly
killing people without guns now now what
would that look like in the United
States in
2023 pick any Town any city in the
United States and you see the bad guys
running through except maybe some of the
cities where they you know they have
really strict gun control but imagine it
in most places well actually imagine it
in a city imagine in a city because you
know what happened if it happened in an
American city everybody from the suburbs
would throw their guns in the back of a
pickup truck and start driving in that
direction in about
three hours the city would be well
armed they would just it would be the
people from the BBS just showing up with
pickup trucks literally with all their
guns in the back and all their ammo and
they're say help yourself go at it right
they might not want to fight themselves
in every case but they're going to bring
you their
guns right if the country is under
attack right not
otherwise so I don't think I don't think
the uh Hamas could have you know been on
foot and wiping out Americans door too
that would not last
long so governor nuum in the midst of
all this video showing that the worst
thing you could do to your population is
leave them
unarmed while you've got uh threats On
the Border at the same time we're
showing video of presumably terrorists
at least some of them just some of them
streaming over our
border do you think Hamas never thought
you know it wouldn't be a bad
idea if you know we've got a few extra
guys let a few of our guys get through
that border it'd be a good time to do it
because it might be useful to get them
you know set up inside the country in
case we need them you don't think that's
already happened of course has you don't
think the cartels are moving their
operators through so that in case
they're needed they're already in place
of course they are and idiot
Nome comes up with some idea to reduce
your access to guns while we're watching
the Israeli citizens being slaughtered
for being
unarmed I'll tell you there's one video
that you're not going to see much of I
don't know if it's real or current but
I'll just describe it and see how many
of you saw it how many of you saw a
video of a family escaping through a top
floor uh window onto the roof of
something so they could get away and
then the last person out the
window uh is the
father and there was gunfire the entire
time the father had he was one of the
few people had a pistol he held them off
until they finished him in the window
and then he fell out and his gun slumped
out of his hand that man saved his
entire family and there were a number of
them it looked like there were at least
a dozen people who came out he saved a
dozen people
because he had one
gun and balls of
steel he had one gun saved 12 people
that's what it looked like because the
report is that the family got
away now you see that guy you see him
get blown away you see him slump and
then in probably the most powerful thing
you'll ever say the last thing you see
before he dies and falls to the
ground is the gun falls out of his
hand and the whole story is told in the
moment that the gun falls out of his
hand I don't think you're going to see
that video because it's too
powerful there's no way you're going to
want to ban guns after you see
that so I think that the gun lobby
people are going to make real sure that
one doesn't show up and by the way I
don't know if it was real I I don't want
to say it was real it could have been
some other conflict for all I know it's
hard to tell but that one was powerful
and um I'm not
surprised yeah that a lot of video will
be unavailable
today so um now what do you think about
the um the question of whether
terrorists are coming through our
Southern border do you think they are or
are they are not would you say that they
are or are not coming through the
southern border actual terrorists could
be Hamas could be cartels
could be
anybody all right I would like to shock
You by saying uh I fooled you into the
wrong question I made you think past the
sale I did that intentionally I made you
think past the sale and you all
failed it doesn't matter if any
terrorists are coming across the border
it doesn't matter you would do
the same thing because the risk is off
it's off the chart you don't have to
know if they're really coming through
you treat it like it's the truth
and you act like it's a fact if you're
asking yourself huh I wonder if some
terrorists you wrong question don't
let anybody question you about whether
or not you have some evidence anybody's
coming across the border who who's a
terrorist do not call for that you treat
it like they're coming across by the
millions exact same actions no
difference if you don't you're a
idiot and you're not you're not on the
side of the United States so you can
find out who's on the side of the United
States this week if they don't close the
 border with the
military with the
military this week whoever is in charge
is not on the side of Americans
you can say that with
confidence America wants that border
closed tight as hell because we don't
want to turn into what Israel's
experiencing right now don't let anybody
tell you that's a question that we don't
know the answer to because it doesn't
matter you act exactly the same if
you're smart otherwise uh and by the way
if if Biden doesn't close the border
like right away like this week that has
to be grounds for uh
removal am I wrong because to me that
would be abandonment of the job now I
don't think abandonment of the job is
technically a reason for uh expulsion
but it should
be yeah I would I would uh you know you
could take him out on what you know of
course we don't want kamla you you have
to get rid of KLA at the same time I
think you'd have to impeach them both
I don't know that's probably not
possible but anyway um what we're seeing
is a preview of
America uh if I could say there was one
sort of Base problem that caused Israel
to have this war the base problem is the
software of the human beings in other
words their brains nobody's fighting for
an asset per se I mean you could argue
they fighting to control Israel but
doesn't look like that's going to happen
so it's more like yeah the wet wear the
the programming and their brains is
broken now are we doing anything like
that in the United States that would
give us a similar outcome and the answer
is yes and we're doing it aggressively
we are aggressively running in the same
direction as Israel uh but we're doing
it by training our own
population to uh be warl like against
the rest of the population so CRT and de
Dei and ESG all have the same quality
that it it says one group is oppressing
you does that sound familiar and there's
one group that is oppressed and the only
way to fix it is for the oppressed
people to either kill or take the stuff
from the
oppressors so in America we're creating
a Hamas Israel situation between uh
people of color mostly black and other
people basically everybody isn't
black where will that end
up you don't have to wonder you're
watching it on
television every time you see somebody
going down the street with a gun wiping
out somebody on the other side and
killing them why is it that they can do
it so
easily they can do it so easily because
the value of human life has been
diminished by their propaganda so when
the uh Hamas Fighters see this family of
Israelis they're not saying to
themselves oh Mom and Dad and you loving
children they're seeing you know some
some view that has been given to them
through brainwashing that they're less
than people they're less than people now
watch the videos on social media of
groups of people beating up
often just one person what do you notice
about
that tuer Carlson got in a lot of
trouble because he once said and this is
terrible it sounds like the most racist
thing he's he was talking about all the
videos of uh usually black people
beating up white people and he said that
white people don't fight like
that pretty racist right if you make a
statement that you know white people are
better than black people that's clearly
a racist sounding statement would you
agree
racist well here's the way I interpreted
it which was different than the way
other people interpret it I interpreted
it that he was saying that from a
cultural perspective which has nothing
to do with your
DNA white people are not
taught that hurting black people for
sport is
entertaining I don't know anybody who
thinks that I've never seen it in fact
if you put uh let's say five black
people or let's say five white people
were trying to beat up a black person
for
fun I think most white people would try
to stop it
immediately because it would look like
just the worst thing ever in our heads
so when Tucker says white people don't
fight like that he's not talking about
anybody's genes he's not even really
talking about culture he's talking about
a training that has been presented to
all of us black and white that the white
people are oppressors the black people
are oppressed and when you see
oppressors oppressing people you go H I
hate those oppressors but when you see
the people who are being
oppressed fighting back against their
oppressors even violently you say to
yourself I guess I had a common have you
seen the video of all the hamash
supporters
celebrating the violence you've seen
that right now from their perspective
they feel that they they are the victims
and when the victims get you know get
one up on the oppressors they celebrate
even though it's violence people
celebrate violence as long as it's
against oppressors we do it too I'm not
better than that if I if I heard that
there's some serial killer that got you
know just totally destroyed by police I
don't say oh the humanity of that killer
I say good I kind of actually got some
dopamine from that story that okay when
I see the bad guys is getting it I feel
a little charged of excitement so in the
United States we've created a series of
systems to guarantee that one group will
feel comfortable abusing another group
and that the people who watch the videos
of it will cheer it
or at least not be too offended by it so
we've created a situation that
guarantees America goes in the same
direction as Israel because but we're
doing it with groups within the country
as opposed to you know something a
somewhat separate group like
Gaza does does this wake up anybody does
it wake you up at all now you can see
why I thought this was worth getting
canceled do you see it now when when I
put my entire life on the line and I
knew I was doing it obviously I mean I
didn't think it would be as fast as it
happened but I knew it would
happen it's because of this that we're
actually creating a Gaza in the United
States and I can't stand for
it and what am I willing to do to make
sure that you know it's happening so
maybe you could do something
differently I gave away everything I
gave away everything so that's how
important I think it is and the way if
you think you can ignore
me good
luck and that ladies and gentlemen is my
show for today thanks for joining on the
three
platforms I will talk to you tomorrow
hope you like the camera it's a new
camera
