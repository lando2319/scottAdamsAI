good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization
minus one
today
i might be a little off my game
but it's only because the news is
serving up repeats
does it seem to you that the news is
sort of like yesterday's news or just
more of it
well we'll talk about that but will that
stop us
from boosting your
dopamine
no
or how about your oxytocin no that's
going to get a little boost too
and
all you need to take it to the next
level
is a copper bugger glass tanker gels or
stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your
favorite
beverage
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure it's the
dopamine the end of the day you can feel
it can you feel the tingle here it comes
here it comes it's the simultaneous sip
go
ah
yeah
yeah
well
i guess the big news
that we haven't talked about in this
format yet
is the uh
amber her johnny depp verdict you all
know that the verdict went johnny depp's
way mostly
so it turns out that people who were not
amber heard
said bad things about johnny depp so he
gets some money for that
while
somebody who was not johnny depp said
some bad stuff about the amber heard
so she'll get some money for that but
less
and then we've also determined
that
she's a narcissist and he might be a
different kind of narcissist and then we
got all confused about that and decided
well
maybe it's just about these two people
i personally don't think this is going
to have a gigantic impact
on the metoo movement
i could be wrong
but i think it's just gonna be it's
gonna look like a one-off case
however
it does give
language
to the amber turds of the world
so
knowing that as we do
that she's not alone she's not the only
one who has her
personality diagnosis
isn't it nice
that when you're trying to inform
somebody for the first time
that somebody has this
let's say a constellation of symptoms
you could say oh you know it's like
amber heard
she was diagnosed with with a set of
symptoms
and so if you remember what she was like
that's what this is
somebody who lies and you know makes it
all about herself and gaslights and all
that and then people will kind of
understand
because until you put a name to
something
people don't really store it
they don't really store concepts but
they'll store ever heard
and every time you refer to her now you
look okay
but here's where it got confusing
because i guess both the defense and the
prosecution if you can call it that
in a civil suit
they they both said that the other
was a narcissist
at one point
but there's two types
the johnny depp narcissist
probably just likes
attention well as a lot of people do
that's sort of the benign kind
and then the
the other kind
is the the dangerous kind the amber
amber herd kind
allegedly if her psychiatrist
if the one who
who testified is cracked
and she's in that personality
constellation
then
she's she's a type you need to run away
from
so
here are some things we learned uh
number one
i would expect that um
they're saying the amber doesn't have
the money to pay
the judgments but i think that only
depends until she does her next movie
and she's already slated for one
uh you know she was in uh aquaman right
the aquaman movie
but now she's uh i think she's gonna be
in another one it's called uh
what's uh
aquitard and the jury pool
i think it's called the aqua turd and
the jury pool
okay that's one we worked on on the
locals platform last night
youtube if you like it
it wasn't my original joke
all right
and johnny depp said he was humbled by
the decision
and uh
and amber heard said she was
disappointed with what this verdict
means for other women
and i was thinking to myself
what does this verdict mean for other
women
because that's sort of subjective isn't
it
i feel like what we learned from this is
you can't lie
and abuse a man and get away with it
every single time
at least sometimes
it might be rare but every now and then
somebody's going to throw away his whole
life just to make a point
and i i'm glad
i'm glad that uh johnny depp set that as
standard
yeah so maybe what uh what it
disappointed what this verdict means for
other women
so certainly there will be cases where
women
are not taken seriously
and then that would be
tragic
but you know there's going to be the
other kind too
where somebody should not have been
taken seriously but they were but maybe
now they won't be
because somebody will say hey are you
amber hurting me because i've seen this
before
so it's going to go both ways
so i the the thing that i love about
this is that the
so-called uh
defamation
was not even written by amber heard
that there's a report that the aclu
wrote the opinion piece
right
so assuming that's true
that the aclu wrote the opinion piece so
she got sued and dragged for something
that the aclu wrote that was false
now she probably she had to approve it
of course i imagine
i assume
so she's still guilty
but it's weird that they were the ones
who wrote it
and then
johnny depp's
problem was that his uh
his own lawyer called
herbs
called the herds accusations
about domestic abuse a hoax
so johnny depp actually lost two million
dollars because his
lawyer called what she had accused him
of as a hoax now i'm guessing
that means that some of the factual
stuff must have stood
because otherwise
the hoax thing would would be closer to
true
now here's the question
is hoax a word that you would have seen
before
2016.
i feel like that word has just permeated
everything isn't it
doesn't that seem like a coincidence
i i i don't know if hoax is a word that
you see in the
in this sort of a
illegal proceeding
well let's talk about elon musk because
everything's related to him so i guess
he told his tesla employees that they've
got to come into the office
40 hours a week
he said anyone who wishes to do remote
work
must be in the office for a minimum
and i mean minimum
of uh 40 hours per week or depart tesla
and he says it's less than we ask of the
factory workers blah blah
and so he's real specific like it's got
to be your actual office
with the people you work in it can't be
a satellite office
now somebody says why
here's the problem
if you were to ask
employees
you know what's your best situation what
makes you most productive
they would probably all say or most of
them would say working at home
or at least not being in the office
that's what they'd say
but you do lose all that casual contact
and other stuff
and
i kind of agree with musk i don't think
you can get anything great done
with remote work
i think remote work is good for steady
state stuff
you know maybe
maybe do the things that you know how to
do
i think it's it's way less good for
getting something changed or improved or
radical improvement or
cannibalizing what you have to
brainstorm up something new
yeah get a rating
all the iterating everything's just
slower
and you know less
risky i guess
and then you don't create any human
human bonds it doesn't bond to the
company as much yet the energy is
different
so i guess i'm going to agree with them
so
i hate it from the perspective of the
employees what makes them comfortable
is probably working at home
but what makes the company they work for
successful
so they can have good retirement
accounts or whatever it is they give
them
um probably going to work
so
i love watching uh
watching cnn try to explain biden's
record
they've kind of given up
have you noticed that
like even cnn has just they've
completely given up on
biden because it would be embarrassing
to try to support him but they do still
wave their hands at his accomplishments
so here are three things
named in the cnn opinion piece today
as is accomplishments it doesn't even
matter who said it because these are
like the standard things so one
accomplishment is
that employment levels are good
employment levels are good
what do you think is that a good biden
accomplishment
well
shouldn't you have to compare that to
what it would be if you were not
on the job and i asked you this
what exactly was it that biden did
that affected employment levels
can you
give me an example of what biden did
that affected employment levels
because i know he did
all the checks that people got during
the pandemic but that
hurt employment didn't it
because people were getting free money
so they didn't want jobs
so
i know what he did
that reduced the number of people
working he gave them free money and i'm
not saying he shouldn't have
i'm not anti that
we know he
yeah he shut down some energy stuff
so that should have worked the other
direction
um
inflation
[Music]
i don't know i'm gas prices i'm trying
to think of anything he did
that wasn't anti-worker
raise taxes i don't know tried to
so i guess but oh here's one the
bipartisan infrastructure bill so
presumably that would have been good for
employment but i don't know how much of
that is actually happening yet
anything
and
so the first one employment levels i
think would have been about the same no
matter who was president
am i right
do you think trump would have had pretty
good employment levels
i mean maybe a little better
but they'd be in the same range
so one of biden's successes was just
going to happen no matter who was
president
the other one is the bipartisan
infrastructure bill
you know there's nothing that the public
cares less about
than a bipartisan infrastructure bill do
you know what the public thinks about
that
that's a gigantic example of corruption
and incompetence
and that even yeah they think pork as
soon as you say it they think pork
so if one of your accomplishments is to
get something done this sounds to the
public like something that shouldn't
have been done
even though it should have been done but
it sounds like something that shouldn't
have been done
some big old pork spending thing
now let me ask you in the comments
how many of you have benefited so far
in a way that you can see some building
or some infrastructure
from the bipartisan infrastructure bill
so as of today
how many of you can see the impact of it
anybody
is there any like construction near you
that you can say well there's that
infrastructure bill
now i think probably there's a great
deal of spending and activity going on
but i don't know of any
so
if you can't think of any any way that
it affects you
i can't imagine you'd vote based on it
so he's got the employment levels that
were just going to be what they were
going to be
the infrastructure bill
that doesn't seem to affect anybody for
reasons that are hard to understand it's
a big deal
why don't
my guess is that it is actually
affecting lots of us
but since the nature of it is it's all
distributed into little projects
you just don't know you just see that
your roads are getting fixed
or you see that there's some something
getting you know built over there but
you don't really know
so and then
he's gives credit for leading the
western alliance against russia
to which i say
should he have done that
[Laughter]
can he take credit for
leading the western alliance against
russia
he lost that war
the i mean they're losing the war right
didn't russia get what it what it
primarily said they wanted
and it looks like they'll probably be
able to hold it
so
those are his three things that are
touted as his successes
and then the things that he says he's
the biden says he's somewhat helpless
about
her inflation baby formula stuff
you know gas prices
the stuff you really really notice
you know you notice baby formula
like i don't i'm not even trying to feed
a baby
so personally the baby formula thing
didn't hit me like you know in my
cupboard
but
even hearing about it is traumatic
did anybody have this experience like
i've i've not even you know been
involved around a baby baby
even as a stepdad i've not been around a
baby who was needing formula because i
came in later
so
i've never even been in that situation
and when i hear babies not getting food
like it sets off every alarm in my brain
like my brain is on fire like must fix
that problem right away you know because
we've evolved
to make that problem number one
feed a baby
like it's about the most basic thing
that we were designed to do by evolution
or whatever
and so when that's not getting done
that's not like not noticing the
bipartisan infrastructure bill
that's like
catches your body on fire
and gas prices are doing the same thing
and inflation is doing the same thing so
i decided to
look at inflation in other countries
to see
all right are other countries having a
big inflation problem and the answer is
yes
it looks like inflation is in fact a
global problem there's still a big
difference
in inflation there are some are way
worse than others
but
the united states doesn't seem to be
like an outlier
but here's the question
would all of those other countries be
having inflation
if the united states were
not aren't we sort of connected to
everything i get that we're all having
the supply chain problem
so that part is not the united states
uh
but
yeah it just feels like the united
states you know sneezes and everybody
gets a cold sort of thing i i feel like
maybe we're causing inflation
just because we're such a big drag on
the economy that whatever we're doing
makes everybody else
have a have a reaction
but here are the things we can conclude
uh number one
there's definitely inflation everywhere
and it doesn't
seem to be really clear what the pattern
is
except that
you know some obvious things are making
inflation so here
if you google why is u.s inflation so
high
this will make you crazy
i actually do this just google
why is u.s inflation so high
what do you think you'll say do you
think it'll say because the government
you know printed too much money
here's what it says
it says this is google's answer
experts say there are three main factors
currently fueling much of the price
growth
sharply raising labor costs
energy prices
and interest rates
and says each one pushes the cost of
everyday consumer goods higher blah blah
now wait a minute
that wasn't an answer
let me say it again
just listen for this it sounds like it's
an answer but it's not even an answer
yeah
why is there inflation because there's
sharply rising labor costs no sharply
raising labor costs are inflation
and energy costs and interest rates all
that so
basically they just re they just defined
what inflation is they didn't give you
any reason so the question was why is
there inflation and they completely
avoid the question of why
now they could have said experts
disagree on the reason
if that's true i don't know
but if you were trying to learn
why there's inflation in the united
states and you googled it
you would get google's official answer
there's absolutely just
misdirection
am i right
now i don't think that the answer is
always as political
as we make it's not always trump's fault
it's not always biden's fault right
you know we we leap to those models
but it's definitely not telling you
anything that
what is it that causes prices to be
higher well
it's the higher prices
so if you hadn't googled that
there it is the thing that causes prices
to be higher is the higher prices
and
also
if you're not following along closely
the higher prices will cause the
inflation
but also the inflation will cause the
higher prices i don't know how we'll
ever stop
that's some helpful stuff right there
well no one's to blame if it's just hey
prices went up what can you do
speaking of prices
so the eu and the uk
uh i guess they've passed some some kind
of laws or rules or something that's
going to block
insurance companies from insuring
russian oil shipments
remember i always tell you
if you want to predict where things are
going
just look at the insurance companies
because they're the ones who have to get
it right
they have to predict risk
so the insurance companies have decided
that shipping russian oil
well at least the government has decided
that the insurance companies will decide
this
is too risky
or
it's too sanctioned
so
i don't know if this means that you know
lloyd's of london will be out of the
game
but does that mean that
some sketchy
north korean insurance company won't
fill in
the blanks and would that insurance even
be accepted
i don't know
so
i would keep an eye on this space
because insurance could just be
you know the the most predictive thing
like it usually is
because things you can't insure just
don't happen
or they're not going to happen at the
same rate or pace or
you know it's not going to be a growing
thing anymore if you can't insure it
so
this could be like a major turning point
in russia's fortunes
and if it is
and i think that would still be a
stretch
but if it is a turning point
it will be yet another example where if
you were watching the insurance industry
it gave you
gave you a warning ahead of time
yes these are scotonopics
all right
uh
what is a woman is that this documentary
out
the documentary what is a woman
you know
the the thing about that kind of content
the old trans what is a woman and
everything
is that that stuff's yeah it's matt
welsh's thing i'm sure i'll watch that
because i think the entertainment factor
will be high
but we're not learning anything
from this kind of
discussion are we
i mean it's just
it's just something to get our
your blood flowing and get us clicking
so i don't think it changes anything but
i'm sure it'll be interesting
one of the things i like is when he puts
ordinary people on the spot
matt welsh and gets them to uh or walsh
and gets them to
explain their
opinions that's always good
all right
uh so now this assessment story is being
framed as a big nothing by the
the democrats
so because the attorney
who was working for clinton got off
so because he's not you know going to
have any legal consequence
they're ignoring the bigger part of the
story which is that in the process of
this trial
we learned that hillary clinton was in
fact
behind this this major russia collusion
hoax and somehow that part of the story
can be you know
just disappeared
because they could make you look at the
other part of the story and say well
there was no nothing criminal
no crimes happen
see you sucker but we don't even know if
no crimes happened
we just know that a jury in washington
dc decided not to convict that's all we
know
which is very different from knowing no
crimes happened
yeah so watching this thing get
disappeared
is
pretty shocking
all right now
am i wrong to say that the news is now
serving up anything new because it's a
slow week right
so
what does 2024 look like to you
everybody
who do you think is going to be running
in 2024 give me your match up so after
after the primaries are done
and they're down to the final two
a lot of people saying desantis over on
the locals platform
over on youtube we'll say you
give us your predictions
all right you think it'll be trump and
buddhaj
all right people are not so sure over
there a lot of people saying desantis
but that depends entirely on whether
trump runs
trump adams not likely
all right newsome
gavin newsom maybe especially if he
loses for governor
you know losing the the governorship of
california would be one thing that would
put him into running for president
um
yeah i could see
i can see it being
gavin newsom
and
trump
oh that would be interesting
oh
imagine that
because of the family connections
you've got don jr with
kimberly guilfoyle
had been married to newsome
that would be that would be an ugly
ugly situation now remember that what
elon musk said and i've said this too
that reality tends to bend toward the
most interesting uh
the most entertaining outcome from the
observer's perspective
not from the people who are in it
doesn't entertain them at all but from
the observers perspective it always goes
toward whatever is the most interesting
and the most
interesting
would be gavin newsom versus trump
that would be the most interesting
wouldn't it
because i feel
i feel that the hillary
redo would just be another trump victory
and it wouldn't
i don't know
it wouldn't feel fresh
2020 was not a case of the most
interesting all right let me ask you
this
imagine these two scenarios and your
trump and you get to pick one
and you have the benefit of hindsight
but only as much hindsight as we have
today and here are your two choices
you can win a second term outright if
you're trump
and you can just serve the second term
but
your second term is going to look a lot
like joe biden's second term even if you
did different policies
because things sort of suck
right so probably things would look
kind of not so awesome it wouldn't look
the way it looks now i mean ukraine
could look completely different
and energy and gas price could look
completely different but it's not going
to look like a great year
wouldn't you say
afghanistan yeah we don't know what
would have happened there so
we'll never know what would have looked
like
but i don't think that this year was
going to be like a great year
or this you know these four years
so now compare this
to joe biden coming in and wrecking
everything
and then trump biding his time and
coming back
and fixing everything that he fixed the
first time and then
and then expanding on that
yeah taiwan couldn't get interesting
fast
so
so the question is
for trump's legacy is he better off to
win two terms consecutively
or it's let biden really
really ruin one term
and then trump comes back and
triumphantly fixes it and shows that he
should not have been defeated in the
first place and you know maybe there was
some skullduggery
that had an impact
you have to wonder
you have to wonder because it's
completely unpredictable
you know you can say that oh trump would
have done all the right things if he'd
been in office so we wouldn't be in this
mess now maybe
maybe
but he might have done other things that
were worse you don't know
there's no way to know
yeah
uh trump's too controversial i think so
all right
people
um is there another topic that uh i have
not broached that needs to be
because i don't think there's much
happening right now
china
but what's new about china
um
taiwan
yeah i don't know if there's anything
new about taiwan either
do i want airspace well you know china
is going to be testing taiwan's airspace
like crazy all right
let me uh
let me give you one idea for a gun
control and see if you would be willing
to consider it
it goes like this
instead of negotiating just with you
know gun control yes or no
you throw in child safety and say all
right it's a child safety bill
and
the age of buying certain weapons will
just be part of the discussion
but it'd also be how to protect them
from social media
how to protect them from i don't know
bad schools so you can come up with
several things that are for protecting
children
the problem is
if you throw an abortion then the whole
thing
you know becomes useless
so you'd have to hold abortion out
but if you made if you made a set of
child-related
policies and said look the reason that
you you know this won't be a slippery
slope
is that it's related to children and
we're we're hitting you know a number of
things it's not about guns it's about
children
so yes there might be a slippery slope
toward protecting children
so that's the slippery slope everybody
wants right
you know unless you get too too nanny
state but if there are obvious things
that would protect children
just obvious things most people are
down for the obvious stuff
yeah so if you could
throw together more than one topic and
say
look you know if if you're going to take
something as
important from the right
as any kind of gun control
even if the only thing you're doing is
limiting the age of your first purchase
of you know an ar let's say if even if
that's all you're doing it's too far
but
if it's part of a bigger bill just for
the kids
it doesn't feel the same does it
it would be hard to vote against the
save the kids bill
so
i'm sympathetic to the argument that
says
you have to be an absolutist about gun
rights
because if they see weakness they'll
chip away that's not crazy
so if so if you're saying to yourself
scott
i prefer our current situation where
it's just you know
log jam
well keep in mind it might not stay that
way because i don't know how many more
you know school shootings it would take
before a few more republicans are going
to crack
so your things are probably going to
change
i don't know if you can stop things from
changing
so if you know things are going to
change your best play is to manage the
change
to the to the minimum change necessary
maybe if that's what you want
so
it's sort of a uh
if you believe it's going to happen
anyway
then you're not dealing with a slippery
slope problem
you're dealing with steering the
slippery slope
because maybe that's all you can do
because it's going to happen anyway
and
the things that we can be sure
well as much as you can be sure of
anything
there will be more mass shootings
though you feel that that's just easy
unfortunately to say there will be more
of them and there will be probably a
greater rate of them
and probably there will be a new one
that shocks us
in ways we didn't even know we could be
shocked
i mean i feel as if
you know there's a whole level
that hasn't been hit yet and somebody's
going to try to hit it
meaning your worst thing ever
and
sooner or later
some republicans are just going to have
to crack
so you either manage the change
or you let the change manage you i think
you think vegas did that
maybe
i think that 60 dead in vegas right and
i don't think it changed anything did it
um
vegas shooting didn't change anything
yeah but you know what's different about
the vegas shooting
is it was adults it's the school
shootings
that activate people
you're not going to activate uh a
republican can you know a republican
politician
by a bunch of adults getting killed
that probably won't activate them
they're going to need to hear
something else now
let me give you
my provocative thoughts
that
i got criticized for
saying something was a thought
experiment
when it didn't not fit some out of
scientific
scientific rigor
but i've said this before
and i don't mean it exactly as a joke
i heard that there's never been a mass
shooting
done by an nra member
is that true
now i'm sure there have been murderers
probably
but there's no mass shooting by an nra
member
now let's say that's true
now number two have there been any mass
shootings by women
yes or no
have there been any mass shootings by
women
somebody says yes
but it's rare
right it's rare
so
um
now here's the interesting one
how many of the mass shootings were uh
let's say left-leaning
would have registered democrat
versus right-leaning and if they had
registered it would have been republican
what would you say
what percentage do you think is left
versus right leaning
are your numbers are all over the place
and
display your bias
i don't know the answer but let's say
it's 50 50.
can we say 50 50 just just to talk about
it it might be 70 30 but the the point
will be the same
point will be the same
suppose republicans
suggested that
if you're a registered democrat
and you have to be registered before you
can buy a gun so i'm just brainstorming
something that would be more funny than
than practical
you have to be registered but if you
register as a democrat you're not
allowed to buy an ar
until you're 25.
but if you register republican
or or
you join the nra
how about that
how about that
you want to get the
nira on your side
pass a law
that says you can't buy an ar
under age 25
unless you're in the nra
and maybe maybe you have to be there for
a year or something
now here's what's interesting about it
do you think the nra would be able to
say that
you know do you think they would be able
to say hey yeah we'll get way more
members
this promotes our idea that people who
join the nra become responsible you know
gun users
you like your shooters incompetent okay
there's that
um
but let's go the other way forget about
the nra that's too polarizing
suppose
suppose republicans
just said we will help democrats ban
guns for democrats
here's the argument
it would not stop republican
problems
but
what if it stopped half of the problems
why would democrats
turned down
a half measure
that would solve half the problem
if it's the only thing they can get
now
this idea will grow on you a little bit
now you have to compare it to getting
nothing done
so here i'm going to make the assumption
that
nothing will get done of any consequence
but suppose republicans literally said
you can't buy a gun under the age of 25
unless you're a registered republican
and here's the deal we know that that
still allows
some mass shootings for registered
republicans
but
if half of them
half of all mass shootings are
democrats
you can at least cut them in half
so who would be against
something that everybody could agree on
because republicans would would laugh
and agree that
taking you know limiting democrats from
having guns until they knew how to use
them it's just a smart idea
it would be so funny
that i think republicans would vote for
it just because it's funny
right
now i'm sure it's unconstitutional or
you know illegal and impractical in some
way but as you think through it
it sort of helps you clarify what
actually is going on here
if the if the democrats wanted
to reduce the number of people were
getting hurt
they would take that deal
right
so that's what the thought experiment
does
the thought experiment tells you that
people were lying
because you can create a situation where
they're getting
50 percent of what they want
and the only and you're comparing it to
getting nothing
and people won't take
people won't take the 50
because they didn't really want a
solution even though it's half
a rational person will take half a
solution
over no solution am i right
so
so i think that it would expose
the thinking on the left that it's that
they're making political points and
they're not attempting to do anything
that's practical in the real world
because if republicans said
hey let's
let's solve half the problem
we're on board in solving your half of
the problem and as far as our half
that's more complicated and nobody has a
solution for that but let's let's solve
half of it
all right
now
let me ask let me ask you when i first
brought that idea up
and you thought okay it's stupid and but
it's funny
and the more i talked about it
the better it sounded didn't it
seriously right right
it sounded a little bit better than you
thought it would
but it better surprised you a little bit
there
okay not everybody
some of you not sold at all now here's
the difference between
you and me
i would have done this
like if i were a republican in congress
i actually
literally would have done this i would
have introduced a bill
and of course it wouldn't get passed
but i would have clarified people's
thinking in the process i would say look
we already showed you don't want to have
fewer dead people
if you ever want to have fewer dead
people join us we'll work something out
but you just proved you don't want that
so i would have done it
i would have done it
just to make the point i would i would
be the grandstanding senator
that's why you don't want me in congress
you don't want me in the senate
especially
because uh
i'd just be grandstanding all the time
i'd never stop
all he knows about his california lol
well i did grow up in upstate new york
so i do know a little bit about a little
bit
i it legitimizes gun control for one
side
then the other side also gets banned
maybe
but
but the thing is
um
if it worked
imagine if it worked
imagine if there was a ban just on
democrat gun sales
and it
and it immediately decreased the number
of mass shootings by 50
because it should right or something
like that
because that would be the number that
were
you know roughly
in that category
so
wouldn't it look like the problem had
been solved so that you didn't need to
have more gun control because it would
look like it was heading in the right
direction and everybody take a victory
lap
the slippery slope
so the tulsa shooting
there was another mass shooting
but was it the wrong ethnicity
somebody's saying so it disappeared
uh
yes we covered the dep verdict
all right
um
what's the history on him confiscation
so apparently i i saw a report today
that the
the red flag laws in florida are working
somewhat robustly
and
there were quite a number of examples
where when you hear the example you say
to yourself oh yeah that's somebody who
should have their gun taken away you
know usually somebody who's made an
actual threat against like real people
like
you know i'm gonna do something bad to
that class
and
i don't know what i don't know what the
law says in terms of when you get your
rights back
but every example that i heard
i said to myself okay that's
yeah i could live with that
i just don't know if they're permanent
permanent would be more of a problem
hey good picture
all right
uh
let me think of an offer you can't
refuse okay
rights are inalienable
no they're not
you your rights can be alienated
is that the right way to say it
what would be the way to say you don't
have inalienable rights
i will
uh
alienate your rights
i don't know that's weird talk that's
weird talk
but i i i always have to explain this to
people like
like i'm the only person in the world
who ever heard it or something
um you can do anything until the
government tells you you can't
and it doesn't matter if they're wrong
it just matters if they have guns
and then they can make you do anything
they want so
you could argue what your right ought to
be
that's not going to help you
rights are given by the creator
are they
are they
are they given are they just here
like
are people who don't believe in a
creator do they have no rights
or they just don't know where they came
from
now the the whole question of your
rights
it's a nonsense conversation there is
only power
there are no rights
if somebody with power decides you can't
do something
you can't do it
i mean without penalty
so
so where's your inalienable rights there
if somebody if somebody can put you in
jail
you don't have any
uh any rights
so it tends to be just a power struggle
and then we
we try to dress up the power struggle by
saying we're giving people their
inalienable rights but but governments
only give people the rights that they
think
are not going to hurt the government
or at least not hurt it too badly
so
um
now i i get that if you were going to
make an argument in court
or an argument to the public saying
stuff like your rights are god-given and
they're inalienable that's good rhetoric
but has no
application to the real world
in the real world
if nobody's going to punish you for
doing something well you can do it
and if somebody is going to punish you
for doing it
well
good luck
that's sort of the end of the the
beginning and the end of your rights
somebody says incorrect
tell me why
no
somebody somebody is characterizing me
so here's how you know
that you're not understanding
if you're rewording if you have to
reword what i say
you're probably rewarding it into
something weird so you can explain why
you disagree with it
if if you
if you simply use what i say it doesn't
look like what you said
right
so i did not say whether
your rights you know exist or something
in some
philosophical way
i'm saying that whether you have
the philosophical right to
uh rights
or a god-given
set of rights it's all irrelevant
what's relevant is you can do stuff that
doesn't get you punished
and the other stuff you better not do
or you better figure out how to get away
with it
but now this this whole inalienable
rights is great
it just has no application to your real
life
james here lives by the hobos code
and and i respect that
i don't know what the hobos code is
but if hobos have a code
i have to think that they developed it
over time and probably goes well with
the whole
train hopping lifestyle and
for example what would the hobos code
say about a
ham sandwich
if a hobo finds a ham sandwich
are they
is said hobo obligated to share it
or scarf it as soon as possible
so nobody else can get it i don't know
all right well i got nothing else going
on here because it's a slow news day but
tomorrow will be awesome i will leave
you only with this thought
you probably will find yourself feeling
a little bit better today than you
imagined
and that's not an accident
and tomorrow you're going to feel even
better
and that's not an accident
either so come back for coffee with
scott adams in the morning same place
same time
and i'll see you
later youtube
