hey everybody
good morning and welcome to the best
coffee with scott adams all day
and i guarantee that if you watch
another coffee with scott adams today
live
it won't be as good as this one because
it won't be me it'll be an imposter
if you'd like to enjoy this to its
maximum extent tonight
i know you do all you need is a copper
bug or a glass a tanker jealous dino
canteen jugger flex a vessel of any kind
fill with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine head of the day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous could
happen now go
well if you were on the local
subscription
service you would already be seeing a
micro lesson on varying your voice
as i'm doing right now for presentations
and it would be streaming without any
commercials
which you could also get on youtube by
the way if you're a subscriber on either
one
hey rasmussen did a poll in which they
found that
because of uh all the athletes who are
likely to make political protests there
you know they're going to try it 34
of the people polled by rasmussen said
they are less
likely to watch the olympics because of
the athlete protests
34 that's a lot 15
said they're more likely so the protests
would make them more likely to watch i
feel like i'm in that category
because i can't think of any reason to
watch the olympics
unless there's a political protest
in which case now you have my interest
i'd like to see somebody raise a fist
get down on a knee make everybody angry
but but the weird thing about the
olympics is the olympics is not like a
regular sporting event
you know the whole point is to represent
your country
so if you get that part wrong the
representing your country part
what the hell are you at the olympics
for or more to the point
why do we even have olympics olympics
are
a ridiculous concept it's a bunch of
ridiculous
competitions for a ridiculous concept or
a ridiculous
event but i guess people like it
so if people like it it's okay with me
it's a free it's a free country ish
hey what's going on in haiti
and cuba let me ask you this
when you heard that the president of
haiti had been assassinated by a
team of mercenaries and then you heard
that the alleged ring leader of the
mercenaries
was a doctor who spends a lot of time in
florida
did you say to yourself well that looks
like a legitimate story
and we know everything we need to know
about that story
there's a doctor he got some mercenaries
and they they
killed the president they were trying to
kidnap him i guess
and the doctor was going to try to take
power
in haiti because why not he's a doctor
who can hire some mercenaries so
i guess that's good enough to be the
president of haiti now keep in mind that
the president
of haiti apparently had turned into a
bit of a dictator
and also that it's the only country i
think with
zero vaccinations so there's
some issues with haiti right
but is there anybody who thinks the cia
is not behind it
now i get that this doctor allegedly
contacted some venezuelan
venezuelan mercenaries but how many
doctors
can organize a coup without a little bit
of help
could you do that if you wanted to
organize a coup
could you put in the phone calls and
do the meetings and plan it up and make
sure you had all the transportation and
the way to pay people
and you got the right people and all
that
i feel that a doctor probably couldn't
pull that off
here's a little back story i used to
i used to work
for a big bank and part of my job for a
little while
was approving business loans to doctors
specifically and what we learned
is that doctors were really bad at
business
they often were great at doctoring but
they weren't good at paying off their
loans and they weren't good at
opening a business and having a private
practice it just was a different skill
set
so there was they were people who should
have been good customers because they
make a lot of money
so that's who you want to give a loan to
but they were unusually bad at paying
back loans
that's why there was a special
department to handle them
now one of the odds that this doctor
was able to pull off a coup attempt got
pretty close
you know you'd have to say that got the
mercenaries there
got them all the way to the presidential
palace didn't work out the way he
planned
in terms of keeping the president alive
i guess
but don't you think he got a little help
a little bit of help
is there any chance that this wasn't at
least partly organized by
american assets do you think
now i have no no evidence no information
whatsoever
to suggest that american intelligence
agencies were involved in this in any
way whatsoever
there's no evidence of that
but we do have a history we do have a
history of overthrowing dictators in
our part of the world now
on social media it was asked why would
we do that
what would possibly be the incentive
to overthrow a dictator in our part of
the world
and i think the the simple answer is we
would do it anytime we could
you know historically whenever we could
get rid of a dictator
and put in somebody who's you know maybe
going to be more friendly to our
interests
we do it unfortunately unfortunately we
do it we're fortunately depending on
your point of view
the other possibility is that some other
country was getting a foothold
a full hold in the sense of could you
imagine that maybe
china was helping out the president of
haiti i don't know that that's
i have no evidence of that but you could
imagine some
you know adversary country was getting a
little bit
uh aggressive there maybe um
i'm seeing in the comments over on
locals people saying
that they have unexploited natural gas
and and oil or something like that it
could be
that that would certainly get the
interest of our cia
who would want to make sure the united
states has access to as many resources
as possible
could have something to do with
vaccinations being low
something like that some of you are
saying it has to do with the clintons
can't rule out anything can you but i
don't have any information
to think that but my point is this do we
live in a world in which you can't
assume this is
that america was behind this
now what about cuba um
i see video of the cubans chanting in
english what and carrying an american
flag in at least one case
they're chanting english slogans
while they're marching in cuba now
obviously it's for american consumption
how many people think that the cia
is not behind those the protests
don't you just assume that they are now
again
i have zero evidence of any kind of
involvement of the united states
in cuba's internal affairs
but we have a history if you know what i
mean it kind of seems to me that this
would be exactly the time
that we might want to give a little
boost to some local people who want to
cause some trouble so i'm not going to
cause
start any conspiracy theories because
these particular ones are already out
there
nor nor is there any evidence that i'm
aware of right no evidence whatsoever
but don't you assume
all right one of my favorite stories in
the news is the
ongoing battle between cnn and fox news
and the various personalities
and especially brian stelter versus
tucker carlson
so today on cnn's site brian stelter and
his uh what do you call him co-worker
oliver darcy who also is a cnn
personality they wrote a uh article
about
what they allege is tucker carlson is
furious with fox news executives
uh allow me to read to you what brian
stelter and
albert darcy say about this they say in
an article
tucker carlson is furious with fox news
executives
for not vigorously defending him amid
his evidence-free claims
what his evidence-free claims
that the national security agency spied
on him in a conspiracy to destroy his tv
show
according to people familiar with the
matter the whole point of it is he had
evidence
that cnn will just call anything
evidence-free
because they didn't report on it but
you could say maybe the whistleblower
was lying
you could say maybe the whistleblower
doesn't exist and he was just made up
you could say the whistleblower was
mistaken
all possible but can you just
brush away the entire story by saying
it's evidence-free
when there's a host of a major network
claiming that he has the evidence i
don't believe
anybody's you know been denied looking
at it
have they why do they call this
evidence-free all right
um one of the sources you know the
anonymous sources
those anonymous sources they've got some
really credible information those
anonymous people
but one of the sources described carlson
as quote
furious with network executives
especially the public relations team
quote for not backing him up tensions
are sky high the person said
another source pointed out that carlson
has always had tension with management
but said right now he's extra pissed
so that's what cnn is reporting with
their anonymous source
by the way do you know what i call an
anonymous source
no evidence whatsoever so here's cnn
shamelessly reporting a story with an
anonymous source
which is no evidence whatsoever
and complaining that tucker carlson's
anonymous source the whistleblower is
not
evidence while using exactly the same
standard to present a new story
okay okay um
here but the best part of the story is
and you have to read a little bit
further to get to it
is a response from tucker carlson
so in a text to cnn reporter sunday
night so this was not a direct
response to stelter but to another
reporter
i guess carlson called the allegation
that he is angry with fox executives
quote absurd and tucker went on to say
i'm not mad at anyone at fox he said if
i was
i'd say so i'm mad at you for lying
relentlessly
what a loathsome person you are please
print that
and then they did so they printed the
part
about the cnn uh reporter being a
loathsome person for suggesting this
ridiculous story
and what about uh tucker's denial
does it sound incredible is it credible
that if tucker carlson had a problem
with his executives
that like he says he would just say so
do you believe that do you believe that
tucker carlson
would say out loud on his tv show that
the people
paying his salary um were making a big
mistake
if he believed that were the case yeah
yeah i totally believe that it's
actually a really good
a really good response because one of
the things about tucker carlson
is that whether he's you know right or
wrong on any given story
and we know everybody in that business
is going to have some some you know
mishits that's just built into the model
right
but whether he's right or wrong on any
particular story
don't you trust that if the executives
at fox news
were screwing him he'd tell you
don't you think like i don't have any
doubt that he would tell us that
even at the risk of you know his his
paycheck i feel like he would
and i i feel like you couldn't say that
about just about everybody
right you know how many people could you
say that
you'd have some confidence that they
would throw their own
paycheck signing boss under the bus
if it were the right thing to do
i think he could and you know
he has also the luxury that i don't
think he would be out of work
right i mean he could always find
something even if it's not at fox
well here's another example of the dog
not barking
every once in a while there's a story
that confirms all your worst
suspicions about reality and especially
about the government
you know all those uh conspiracy
theories and those suspicions you have
about your government
well as matt tayeby tweets
imagine if the fewer imagine the furor
if donald
trump jr held an auction where he sold
paintings for between seventy five
thousand and half a million a piece
and the buyers were allowed to remain
anonymous
good point right now remember matt taube
is not a
right-leaning uh observer he is one of
those rare people who can
take a side wherever it makes sense so
he's
so you never know which side he's going
to take because he's just following
following what common sense and data
should be
leading you where it should be leading
you but this is the sort of story
that confirms everything you thought
about the public being manipulated
and that your news is nothing but
propaganda
because there is no chance as matt tybee
points out there's no chance this
wouldn't be the biggest
story in the world if don jr were doing
exactly what hunter biden were doing
does anybody doubt that
that statement is there the slightest
chance
that if don jr were doing this painting
situation
that it that it wouldn't be gigantic
and by the way if
if don jr decided to make some really
bad paintings
like like paintings that look like a
monkey did it you know a drunken monkey
and then put them up for sale for half a
million dollars a piece
and and also say that he won't tell the
public who bought them
wouldn't that be funny now i i assume
that don jr doesn't have any artistic
ambitions but that's what would make it
funny
that he would actually do some paintings
like literally you know take the brush
and the actual painting
and actually make a painting but it
would look like hell
because he's not an artist i'm just
guessing he's not an artist maybe he is
who knows
maybe he has that talent but let's say
he doesn't because it's funnier
and just do a just do a total mess of
a painting and just put it up for sale
for half a million dollars
and say that he won't reveal who the
buyer is
and just see what happens just for fun
right now of course it doesn't mean as
much because
you know his father's not in power at
the moment
but he might be right
his father has a lot of power even if
it's persuasion
so that would be fun all right
how many of you watched trump's speech
or saw
any eclipse at cpac
did you have the same impression i did
which the moment you turned on trump
you were interested again
that guy is so freaking good
at making you interested in what he's
saying
it's just crazy and you can get a little
bit used to it when he's empowered
you're seeing him all the time
you know you you become accustomed to
how good he is
at what i call the show you know the
part where you
make everybody pay attention to you he
is
crazy good and you forget
because he's that he was out of the
limelight for a little bit but as soon
as you see him again
wow and there's nobody in the public
realm who's even close
wouldn't you say in terms of being able
to hold the attention of an audience
being provocative being memorable being
quotable
you know people want to pass the clips
around who would be
named the second best person in the
world or let's say just
united states politics so limited to
united states politics
name the second best person
who's a politician yeah i'm seeing you
talking about media people candace owens
etc but name a politician who can even
come close to that
desantis now desantis is really
competent and a president desantis is
not a bad idea at all
but he's closer to biden in terms of his
holding your attention rand paul is
good but no he's not in trump's category
uh trey gowdy is great but he's
he's not really running for anything
senator kennedy
he is really fun to watch that's true
he's very he's very
quotable but not not going to run for
president matt gates
somebody's saying back gates is
um definitely has a lot of those talents
yeah he's not he's not trump level
but that's that's about as close as you
can get i guess
maxine waters yeah that's that's not a
bad
yeah maybe aoc i don't know
but we miss him he's in terms of the
excitement he brings
um there's an article in the new york
times by michael shearer talking about
how
boring biden is and he even admits he's
boring and
um even the new york times i think is
going to start to miss
the excitement a little bit i think they
already are
and i wanted to point out the one thing
that biden did well
or almost well because you know
when i talked about trump i like to talk
about his persuasion ability
separate from whether his policies were
ones you like
i'm going to do the same thing with
biden independent of his policies or his
competence
or whether you want him to be president
everybody made fun of when he went down
to the whisper
remember what he was giving the speech
and when it came to an important part
he whispered and everybody's attention
went to the whisper and then people said
oh that's kind of creepy and weird and
it became the clip everybody played
right but
from a persuasion point of view
it was really good the problem was i
don't think he picked a topic to whisper
about that was of much interest
if he had used that whisper on something
that actually did matter
you know and really could become the
clip that everybody listened to and
and he didn't whisper for too long
because i think he made that mistake too
but in terms of voice modulation
i've got a micro lesson i just put on
the locals
platform about how to vary your voice
much like biden did and to do it with
for good effect
uh persuasion-wise hey here's some
a cool thing about the future and the
golden age
which i think is here
mashable which is a good follow you
should follow mashable
on twitter uh they talk about there's a
water taxis there's a company going to
do a bunch of water taxis that'll
operate like uber but on the water
so if you live in a coastal town there
are about 50 cities they have targeted
you'll be able to use your app and call
this little electric
hydrofoil that looks like a little car
on the water
but it's a hydrofoil meaning it lifts up
when it's going so that the only thing
in the water is a
smaller foil so it has minimum
minimum drag and it's already
existed or it's already being tested and
it's being rolled out
and this is the the perfect place for
self-driving cars
because the water is going to be a lot
easier to
you know have rules and watch out for
traffic and stuff
i think maybe it's harder but it seems
like
it would be easier than getting
self-driving cars on the roads
so this is cool thing to watch for the
water taxis
a real thing meanwhile over in tibet
they just opened up a new bullet train
and i guess it's from the town or region
of uh
uh f-u-x-ing
foxing uh i think that's how you
pronounce it so it's called the
the foxing bullet train now
i saw some video of the foxing train and
i'll tell you that's
that's one beautiful foxing train um
oh you think it's pronounced fujing well
that's not funny
i know you think it's pronounced fushing
but how funny would that be
i guess this joke works better in
writing
well that's the foxing bullet train
part of my presentation did you all see
uh richard branson in space
i started to complain about him because
once he was up there it was pretty
inspiring actually and
it was a lot of fun and you know branson
always brings the show too
he's he's a ballsy entrepreneur he uh
he had a an aim of being the first one
up there of the billionaires
he got it done his technology worked
congratulations richard branson uh so
again branson is one of the just
greatest assets on the planet really
likewise bezos and elon musk and
and the rest of them but um
he did a little uh message from space
once he was up there
and his and they were all you know
running around
in the inside the aircraft waitlist
which looked
pretty fun but he started out by saying
that when he was a little kid
he had a dream to go to space and
then here he was he made it and i
thought to myself
i feel like that was a rare mistake
from branson now i i did enjoy
his his uh adventurous you know nature
i do enjoy that he loved it and i you
know i
i could feel his enjoyment and i could
feel his success and everything
but here's the thing space isn't about
the billionaires
right i mean they're fun to talk about
and they're the ones making it happen
so you got to give them tons of credit
but
it's space space is sort of for
everybody
right and this accomplishment although
is tremendous
i don't feel like the right
branding or persuasion is for branson to
tell us about
his personal dreams since he was a kid
it's a good story and i like knowing it
but i feel like i feel like it should
have been closer to
you know one small step for man one
giant leap for mankind
there's some acknowledgment that
branson's accomplishment which is
tremendous
and branson gets you know the credit
right
you can't take anything away from him
from what he did it's an amazing
accomplishment
but it was sort of for everybody and
at least that's the way i feel about it
because the billionaires only
exist because we let them
right now they made their money they you
know they
they forced the universe to cough up a
bunch of money for them so they get all
the credit for that
but they only get to do it because we
let them
honestly i mean it's not like we took a
vote but if society just said
we don't like billionaires anymore they
just can't exist well they wouldn't
and they wouldn't be able to do cool
stuff like this that should benefit
everybody
so i guess i would just say to the other
billionaires
and i think i think elon musk gets this
right
by the way when musk talks about you
know going to mars and stuff
he doesn't say i have a dream
although i'm sure he said that as well
but he tends to talk
more about how humanity has to go to
mars
and yeah he says we yeah i think elon
musk gets this right
that is not about him even though it is
about him right
he knows to make it about humanity and
uh i guess branson
i just i feel like branson just slightly
missed
his usual impeccable persuasion and
branding
which are among the best there's ever
been i would say
just a very small small quibble
on a a great accomplishment so
congratulations
um here's a little update just to make
you angry
because i know it does um you've heard
of nature the publication
so nature is one of if not the most
respected scientific journals on the
planet
does everybody agree with that statement
first of all that the publication
nature is sort of at the top tier
of respectable publications i'm seeing
in the comments a bunch of people saying
no
so let's do a fact check on that a lot
of people say no
now i'm um i think there are two ways to
answer this question
there's the historical truth which would
be yes
and then there's maybe there's a cynical
current
truth that you can't trust anything you
can't trust anything in a publication
it doesn't matter how respectable they
are you just can't trust them
so let's hold both of those views all
right just hold both of those views for
a moment
but i would say that whether you trust
them or not they do re
they do represent some of the finest
in science right publication wise
whether it's
good or not it's some of the finest and
they're finding on don't turn this off
yet
don't stop this live stream their
finding is that science and the
and the consensus is clearly that masks
work
i'm only putting this out there because
a lot of you who say masks
don't work will say it's because i've
looked at all the evidence
well here's nature in an article that
says
we looked at all the evidence and it
looks like scientists say it works
the mass work on top of that they talk
about a test they did with some animals
so unlike testing with humans you can
you know you could argue how ethical it
is but it's legal
to test with animals and they just put
animals
between a barrier that was the same
material as the masks
and they had some infected i don't know
if they were hamsters or whatever the
hell they were
and they were in one side and then on
the other side in close proximity
separated by mask material
they would just see if the other one
would get the the covet
because animals can get covered and what
they found was that when there was a
mask
barrier there the rate of infections
went way down
so those of you who said hey
this masked material and i think they
were using even standard masks not just
n95s so those of you say hey
the mater the virus is smaller than the
mask
so therefore the the virus will pass
through that material just like it isn't
even there
that is disproved i would say that's
disproved so if your argument was
the virus is small and if you put a
barrier
there it'll act like it's not even there
it'll just go right through it
the animal study pretty much proved
that's not the case
now that's not the whole argument some
of the argument is
that so much air is getting out from
around the edges
that you know you're not making much
difference but
i don't think anybody doubts that a lot
of the air
is going into the mask and presumably
the air that does go through the mask
has some kind of a filtering effect
because it worked with the animals
now again can we all be deeply skeptical
here
let's be deeply skeptical does it tell
you anything that there's an animal
study on masks
is that conclusive no
no it's not even close so none of this
is conclusive
the fact that it's in a most respected
publication
doesn't mean you should trust it or i
think we're all on the same page there
doesn't automatically mean you should
trust it
but if you'd like to know what science
thinks collectively as a consensus this
is pretty good place to find out
and i think it's telling you that mass
work now do you believe that
stay skeptical i'm just reporting what
the newest is
likewise ivormectin you know the story
on ivermectin
which uh oh i can't even say this on
youtube can i
uh i just realized i'm not talking only
to the locals
people where i could say anything i want
about this topic
so i have to modify my presentation to
not be booted off
oh i actually i'm in good shape because
what i'm going to say is that there's a
study that says ivermectin doesn't work
now if there's one study let's say
there's one new study because there are
lots of studies already
but if there's one new study that says
ivermectin doesn't work
how much credibility should you put in
that
none right basically zero
so i think everybody who's smart
realizes you're gonna have to look at
all the studies to
to figure out if there's anything there
so one study really doesn't tell you
really anything but remember that the
argument
in favor of ivermectin was based on the
fact
and correct me if i'm wrong and um
you know i think a lot of people will do
that
but the argument is that the iv
the people who think that it works are
saying that the signal
and the the evidence is so strong that
you can see it in almost
any kind of test
so you don't need a you don't need the
best kind of test in the world
so say the proponents because almost any
kind of test shows it works
you could do almost anything and it's
just such a strong effect
there it is well if you believe that was
the case
we know thanks to anatoly lubarski who
found this
and tweeted it we know that there is one
new study
the newest one that says it doesn't work
now did they use the right protocol
did they did they have the right amount
of ivormectin that
would be the right amount to test did
they test it in the right people
in the right timing of when they had
symptoms
i don't know probably there's some
problems with it like every other study
so how much should you take away from
the fact that there's one study that
says it doesn't work
nothing nothing unfortunately we live in
a world where it doesn't mean anything
it's still going to be persuasive to
some of us
because you can't not hear it you know
everything becomes
part of your thinking but rationally you
shouldn't
pay attention to it um all right
remember when i famously predicted and
was mocked by all of the media both
a year ago and more recently because the
year had passed
and i said that if biden got elected
that republicans would be hunted
well did the simulation
serve up a son of the president
whose name was hunter so first of all
that's weird
that the president's son is literally
named hunter
but that's coincidence however
what do we know about the january 6th
protesters
who are still in jail how much
transparency do we have on that
and could it be said that those
republicans were hunted
and jailed
i feel like that's exactly what happened
now of course
we know that some number of them did bad
things and
the legal system needs to do what the
legal system does
but we also know and without any doubt
whatsoever
that the vast majority of them did not
do anything
did not do anything violent they
certainly did something illegal
because they were trespassing but
does it seem to you that the republicans
who did not do the violent stuff
were haunted and jailed and that they're
still in jail
because that's what it looks like to me
to me it looks like
exactly my prediction the republicans
were hunted
now do you know what the critics say if
i bring this up
they say but scott you're not in jail
you weren't hunted well first of all i'm
not a republican
but second of all does that matter
did somebody think that i meant all of
them like every every single republican
would be jailed
all 80 million of them or however many
there are
no i think that a decent respect
to reading comprehension would tell you
that it just means that it would happen
too much
doesn't mean every single republican is
going to be you know
murdered or jailed or something and
i feel like i can claim victory on that
on that prediction how many republicans
have hidden
their uh affiliation for career reasons
right if people are hiding their
republican values
for career reasons yeah in the comments
people are saying me me me if you're
hiding your affiliation
isn't that because you're afraid of
being hunted
or at least being revealed
yeah i don't think i'm too far off on
on that prediction now there's
there's something that i notice in
social media and all
political commentary that i i'm going to
give a name i call it binary theater
here's what binary theater is so it's
just a name i'm putting on it
suppose you're talking to somebody about
the january 6th event
and they call it an insurrection and
they say it's an insurrection because
there were violent people there
and therefore all the people who are
jailed are violent
they're they're acting as though there's
only um two possibilities
that everybody there was a violent
insurrectionist
and then they're going to be talking to
somebody who's trying to make the
opposite case
that there really wasn't violence and
there was just a protest
now both people in this kind of a debate
would both know they're lying and they
would also know
that each other knows the other one is
lying
now if you're gonna lie and act like
it's all
it's all violent on january 6 or that
it's all non-violent
what is the point of that it's just
theater right
because you're not persuading anybody
you're not adding any new information
you're you're engaging in this weird
theater where you both know you're lying
about the description of what happened
and yet
you act like you're not that's not a
debate
what is that it's just theater isn't it
two people lying while the other one the
other one knows they're lying
that's like a stage production and you
see it you go
what happened to us what happened to
humans
that they act like things that are
clearly not binary
are binary just so they could have this
weird
theatrical disagreement
over something that nobody disagrees
over
yes it's a a pro wrestling model taken
to politics maybe trump has something to
do with that
because he did take the the wrestling
model to politics
um well i hope there's nobody in the
comments who's arguing it was
non-violent because it looked like
somebody was starting to do that
you know i get that you know somebody
died of a heart attack etc but it was a
violent
it was a violent situation i don't think
that's
some we should debate um
it was an incursion somebody says no
guns though
well that that is kind of remarkable
the the uh the number of guns there is
a number of guns that weren't there is
remarkable
now um is there any uh black lives
matter protest
being planned and if not
why not and are there have there been no
uh major police shootings of black
motorists people who have been stopped
by the police
have nobody has nobody died since
biden's been in charge
or is it just that we don't report it
now
um the woke have been up for four years
i don't know what that means
all right um
it was a protest and a riot blah blah
blah
the cia told black lives matter to stand
down well i don't
know that we can make that assumption
yeah it looks like black lives matter
just
did what got everything they wanted
do you think they got everything and
they're done
an assertive self-directed tour of the
government building
i like that and how about antifa
anti-far didn't even have demands that
yeah i mean other than
getting rid of the system itself did
antifa just decide there's nothing to
protest over
you realize right that we can say
with a fair degree of certainty at this
point
that neither antifa nor blm were
natural um natural protests
can we say that at this point with
certainty or would you
still say that's speculative because if
they were real
nothing changed to satisfy their demands
nothing changed so if they were ever
real
they should be you know as big as
possible right now i mean they should be
firing up
summer should be lit right literally lit
so could we say at this point that the
hunter biden
the way that that story is being handled
let's say his artwork with the anonymous
buyers that's proof that the
intelligence agencies and the government
and the media are colluding against the
people
isn't it can't you say that with
certainty
without any extra information that the
way the
hunter story is being treated proves
a nexus of the intelligence agencies the
government
and the media now
likewise can we say the same thing about
the lack of protests from blm
and antifa can we say
that the reason they're not happening is
that the intelligence agencies decided
that they wouldn't
and that the media probably wouldn't
have covered it the same way anyway
so it feels like we have confirmation of
everything bad we ever imagined
with the exception of you know any
election
irregularities i would say that there's
no proof of that
but could there be
is it possible i was looking at a letter
to the editor
that was saying they should take dilbert
anna the newspaper
and the argument was that i am spreading
the quote big lie
and therefore dilbert should be taken
out of newspapers
have you ever seen me spread the big lie
i'll reiterate my position which is that
we don't have evidence or at least i
don't i don't have any
evidence that i would consider
conclusive that the election was
rigged so i don't have that evidence but
i have said that you can guarantee that
because of the nature of the system
you know it has has vulnerabilities and
the intelligence
agencies of all the major countries have
a great incentive
to either manage their own countries
elections or even other countries
elections
that you could say with certainty that
the american
election process will be corrupted
we just don't know if it's already
happened so it's either in our future
guaranteed or it already happened those
are the only two possibilities
if you're saying to yourself no i don't
i don't think an intelligence agency is
going to get control of the elections i
would say
you know they have the tools to do that
right they have all the tools
they can do that they would simply have
to want to
and do you think that the intelligence
agencies are really somebody at the top
who makes a directive and writes it down
and sends out a memo
and then everybody does you know what
the memo says
no i don't think intelligence agencies
work that way
there are simply people who know what
would be good for the intelligence
agencies or their view of what would be
good for the world
and they have the tools to make it
happen and they can put pressure on
private citizens to do the actual work
so there's no fingerprint from an
intelligence agency
so you have to look at the intelligence
agencies two ways
one is that something comes from the top
but the other is just a lot of people
independently knowing what
in their opinion would make the world a
better place and maybe they don't want a
paper trail
maybe they just make it happen by
influencing
private citizens mostly
all right
