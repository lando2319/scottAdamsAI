good morning everybody
and are you lucky
yeah because you're here and everybody
else isn't
well you know
and if you're here you are already
participating on the upside
right
it's one of the best things that'll ever
happen in the history of
humanity it's going to happen right now
and you're part of it and if you'd like
to take it up to here to four unknown
levels all you need is a copper mug or a
glass attacker jealous inside the
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine hit of the day you can
feel your body start to respond even as
i prepare as soon as you take this hit
this hit
yeah a little bit of a dopamine spike it
might last you all day
go
so does everybody see the viral photo of
mark zuckerberg taking a selfie with his
staff
uh i guess the internet's having a lot
of fun with this
uh the the
the caption i thought was the funniest
was
zuckerberg take you selfie just like the
humans
have you've seen this just like the
humans
and
there's another
another tweet from news 18. it says mark
zuckerberg's soulless selfie with
colleagues fuels alien theory once again
the theory that zuckerberg is an alien
[Laughter]
i don't know it does look like a
soulless selfie
[Music]
if anybody was ever an alien from the
future
or actually a time traveler you know
somebody went back in time it would have
to be zuckerberg
right
scott is over tired you're right
you're right i am underslept and
overtired but i'm gonna try to take care
of that this week
well here's a new discovery that might
change everything
it turns out that there's a rare
material that you need for a fusion
and we didn't think we had much of it
because it exists mostly in space
and on the moon
and it's hard to get your raw materials
from the moon it's hard to get it from
china
much less the moon
but apparently this thing called
helium-3
is 10 times more likely or 10 times more
abundant on earth than we thought
so that's really good news for
future cheap energy
we're probably a number of years away
from that but as you know fusion is
working now
where it has never worked in the past
and by working i mean they can create
more energy than they use for the first
time
so now it's an engineering problem and
we will have fusion and the solution to
everything
which is almost true
if you had abundant cheap energy
it would be very close to the solution
of everything
everything everything would be cheaper
better
you'd have less climate problems you'd
have just everything um
all right
rasmussen uh did a poll and asked
american likely voters who do they think
is winning the war the russia ukraine
situation
and i was a little bit surprised at this
answer
fifteen percent one five
uh say that russia is winning the war
only 15 percent
of people polled
think russia is winning the war
now
is that because russia is not winning
the war
or is that because
that's what the news told us
because
i don't know how you could say they're
not winning it's really just a question
of how much
how much expense they're willing to
absorb and how much you know political
and other capital they're willing to put
in but i don't think you can necessarily
tell anybody's winning or losing at this
point can you because like i said it's
it's going to be a tipping point
situation
one of the two sides will reach some
kind of a tipping point but you never
really know which one is the closest to
the tipping point
not really it's too much fog or war
so
uh 25 of respondees
said that ukraine is winning
25
25
25
say ukraine which has been completely
destroyed
is winning the war
interesting
25
42 say it's a stalemate
um now i of course uh fall into the uh
maybe 25
this time
because
um i think i'm like the only person dumb
enough to say in public
what if they win
you know for me it's always been you
know are you so sure russia is going to
win this thing
and let me ask you do you know anybody
who's been talking about this publicly
you know anybody who does this for a
living so to speak
is that did anybody else say that russia
would have as hard a time as they're
having
because i said it from the start
in fact i was predicting that they
wouldn't
uh they wouldn't even attack
because it seemed so obvious that we
would be in the place where we are now
to me it looked obvious
but you know what do i know everything
looks smart if you get one right
right if you guess right
then you're pretty sure it's because
you're genius not because you guessed
right that's sort of what i'm feeling
right now
i think it was my great insight not my
luck
but i got i was completely wrong that
they wouldn't attack
but i was completely right
that ukraine would surprise with good
with high-tech weaponry
and that the attack would not be easy
and
here we are
so
but i'm kind of amazed at the
the effect of the news
the news has actually convinced people
that uh russia is losing the war and
maybe they are in some sense or maybe
they will
but
um
then rasmussen asked
likely u.s voters should the u.s be
involved if there's a wider war in
europe
46 said yes
and 31 said no so apparently the us has
been properly primed
not not completely you need to get that
over 50 percent
but the us has been primed for a major
world war
and that the population is largely on
board with world war iii
do you do you see the impact of
propaganda and fake news in this
it feels like these opinions are
completely assigned
right
how long have i been saying that people
don't come up with their own opinions
opinions are assigned
you know democrats have their opinions
signed to them republicans have their
opinions assigned to them but then we
think that we thought it out
you know after the fact we say i think i
thought this through and came to this
opinion no you didn't
it's not likely if you have the same
opinion as your team it was probably
assigned if not this time sometime in
the past
oh let me see this
all right
here's some obvious sounding fake news
i'm gonna say this is fake news
because it sounds exactly like other
fake news
so you know there's this book by mark
esper he had been trump's uh
what was he
defense secretary
and
he says that trump when the black lives
matter protesters were surrounding the
capitol i guess
trump asked can't you shoot protesters
in the lake or something
and then esper
interpreted that as the president
wanting the military to shoot people in
the legs
now what do we know about trump's
decision-making
process
does this sound like real news or fake
news
because i'm willing i'm willing to
accept the that trump said those words
but is he interpreting this right
actually i'm willing i'm willing to
accept he actually said those words you
know why
because it's the way he treats every
topic
everything we hear about him behind
behind closed doors
is he always tosses out a republican
idea just to see what happens
so he tosses out an extreme idea that
usually comes from some republican
you know uh person just to see what the
response is
so you don't think that there were some
republicans somewhere who say why don't
you shoot the protesters in the leg or
maybe he was talking about rubber
bullets right that context would be left
out but even the rubber bullets is
pretty extreme that's pretty extreme
and
so you heard him say that yeah but it
sounds like this the sort of thing that
he says on every topic
you know could we use a nuke
should we shoot him in the leg
you know can we can we lob a missile
into the cartels do you see the pattern
the pattern is he asked the question
about the most extreme
response
and then as espers described
that esper and i guess a few of the of
the aides
walked him back from the idea of using
the military at all
all the way to not using military
and then trump agreed
what is the problem if trump throws out
an extreme suggestion
and then his advisers say no the extreme
doesn't work
but we'll walk you back to what might
work
isn't that
exactly what you want
like not even a little bit wrong
imagine if he had never even floated an
idea that's the extreme version
you have to float the extreme version
don't you
that feels like good management to me
you put out the extreme and then you
make people argue for the middle ground
make them work for it
he made him work for it
did he not
i mean i don't think i don't see how
people are
like oblivious to the fact that he made
his advisors work
to sell their opinion and that he bought
it
and then he bought it if you make your
advisors work for it and then you accept
their recommendation because you saw the
work
okay
because apparently the way they the way
they talked him back
was through a pretty rational
you know cost benefit analysis
and then once he heard the cost benefit
analysis he said okay we'll do that
what the hell is the problem with that
the the problem is people telling other
people internal conversations
the problem is esper
this is a story about esper
being a bad person
meaning that he's talking about private
deliberations which included
brainstorming
if you're talking about a private
brainstorming conversation
in which the point of it is to throw out
you know throw all the ideas and just
see what the reaction is and that's
exactly what he was doing threw out an
idea and asked for a reaction
if that stuff is what you're leaking
you're a
really
that is just so
low
in my opinion because it's clearly an
attempt to make it look like it was more
of a serious idea than it was that's how
you sell a book
so he's basically throwing the president
of the united states under a bus
to sell a frickin book
is that a patriot
doesn't sound like it
it doesn't sound like a patriot and by
the way this has nothing to do with
trump or republican or democrat i always
say exactly the same thing if we were
talking about a democrat
exactly the same thing if somebody is
talking about the brainstorming
conversations
and trying to sell that out of context
that's just weasel behavior that's just
horrible behavior
such a jerk
anyway
apparently no we have fake news of
course everywhere but now there's
something called fake job acceptance
where the i guess the job market is so
hot and so hard to get good employees
these days
that uh
there's the wall street journal is uh is
reporting the incidence of so-called
ghosting of accepting offers and then
saying that you'll start and then not
showing up is at a record high so people
are accepting jobs
and just not going
because they get another job usually or
they change their mind or they don't
even bother calling
i might be back on monday
but then again i might not
um
so i don't know what to say about this
except everything is fake now
yeah it's a fake news
fake you throw in your own fakes
whatever but now even fake job
acceptance
that's a new high
i keep hearing about people with two
jobs how many people do you know
who are working remotely and have two
complete jobs and the employers don't
know that they're working two jobs
in the comments do you know anybody
personally
somebody says they know many people
a bunch of yeses going by
yes
yes
we
fired one doing it they found somebody
doing it and fired it
ben thinking about it giggling what a
great idea
yes yes apparently it's widespread
it's pretty widespread so it doesn't
matter how many knows we hear
the fact that there are lots of people
who say yes tells me it's pretty
widespread
so i don't even know if that's a bad
thing is it
because think about a typical full-time
employee
do you ever get more than 50
productivity out of an employee
not really
because it seems like after you do the
important stuff
everything else is a meeting
or something less important
i feel like you could do the important
stuff for two different jobs
fairly easily
if you skipped all the unimportant stuff
like commuting
i mean imagine the people who are
commuting 90 minutes a day
if you gave me an extra 90 minutes
and said look
you can bank the 90 minutes so you can
use that for your second job
but also we'll take let's say we'll
shave 20 off of this your main job
add that there
and you have almost enough to sell it to
the new employer almost enough time
somebody see more of that
meanwhile in international relations
finland is getting close to
requesting
joining nato
which would put a nato
uh
nato member
on russia's border with an 800-mile
border
and apparently finland has been using
u.s equipment for years so that's an
easy transition to nato
and they have actually an unusually
strong military
did you know that
apparently finland has a really good
military
i guess you have to if you're on the
border of russia
so what has putin decided uh will be his
attack on finland
well he's decided that the finns are
nazis
that's right
so putin basically has one strategy
well if you don't like me you're some
kind of a nazi and he could always make
an argument for it so in this case the
argument is that finland
i think fought with the nazis
so he's going to call finland a bunch of
nazis sweden is also considering joining
finland
some point and seems like they'd have a
good shot at it
now this raises the question if if the
whole reason we're having at war with
ukraine
is because ukraine was flirting with
nato
why would we do more of it
why would we do more of the thing that
caused the war
is it because we think putin is so you
know beaten down by this war
that we can just push him
because pushing putin has got what what
got us in the war right
it was didn't we sort of push him into
attacking ukraine
so are we going to push him into
attacking finland or is he so
so beat up from ukraine
that he wouldn't have the will to attack
anybody else
i don't know you know i like the idea
that was floated about i think macron
said it and
who was it uh somebody else said it uh
that there should be some other kind of
organization that's not called nato
so you could kind of weasel it
i think maybe trump has suggested this i
heard i haven't heard him say it
but the idea would be you'd have some
kind of
protection association
but you wouldn't call it nato
i don't know does that buy you anything
um
what do you say
i google the f
the finnish prime ministers i know
exactly what you're saying it turns out
that the finnish
prime minister is a woman who is
attractive that's why that's why you
told me to google it right
i saw the picture today and i thought
that really looks like she got a she got
kind of a political boost by her
appearance
but uh yes they have an attractive uh
prime minister apparently
um and that alone is reason enough to
put them in nato i say
uh what do you think about this let me
ask you
wisdom of the crowd time
do you think it's a good idea or a bad
idea for finland to join nato go
good idea or bad idea for finland to
join nato
all right i'll read your responses they
always go by faster on the locals
platform
i'm seeing a mix
more bad than good but definitely a mix
looks like
50 50
60 40.
all right a lot of disagreement on this
it's a good idea because of ukraine
maybe yeah we don't really know do we
so if you don't know if it's a good idea
or a bad idea what do you do
what do you do what do you do if you
don't know if you legitimately don't
know if it's a good idea or a bad idea
what do you do
do you do something or nothing
if you don't doubt if you don't know why
would you spend money on it
so here's a decision-making uh
suggestion
if you think it might make a big
difference but it's sort of a toss-up
one of them is very expensive and one of
them is not
you would do the one that's less
expensive if you really really didn't
know the difference
if you suspected there was a difference
and and your let's say your own security
mattered
then you might make a different decision
all right
well um
i don't know i i don't know if it's
going to happen i feel as if delaying it
would make a difference
uh because you don't want to give
you don't want to give putin too much of
a loss or else he can't negotiate his
way out of it right
you don't want it to be too embarrassing
for putin
while you also need to negotiate
so that might make sense to just put the
finland decision off
like just don't don't put it in the
current mix just delay it a little bit
something like that
all right so i provocatively tweeted the
following question is
if putin were president of america would
he be a democrat or republican
as you might not be surprised it got a
lot of attention on twitter
so here are the things we know about
putin and we're going to try to decide
if he sounds more like a democrat or
more like a republican if he were an
american right
so here are some things we know about
putin
he calls his opponents nazis
okay is that republican or democrat
he censors speech
democrat or republican
he favors universal health care
he creates lots of fake news
he favors abortion apparently because
russia has the highest one of the
highest rates of abortion of any country
now he is trying to get the abortion
rate down
but in terms of making it legal it's
it's about as legal as you can get
he puts protesters in jail
and he favors uh in russia they have
very strict background checks for gun
buyers you can you can buy a gun
just like the united states but they're
very strict on
your mental health background and
background checks
so you can't buy a gun in russia unless
there's a background full background
check
um so does that sound more democrat or
more republican
what do you think
all right obviously i left out some
things
i i'm just trying to get people riled up
because it's fun
um so here would be some arguments that
he's a republican
boone likes a strong military
but
he didn't fund one
did he
he wants a strong military but
looks like he underspent
who who says they want a strong military
but they don't spend money to get one
it sounds like a democrat doesn't it if
he wanted a strong military and we saw
evidence that he had funded a
well-maintained strong military
then i would say oh that sounds more
republican
but it is a high percentage of gdp so
that sounds sounds a little more
republican that way
all right how about uh
um
he
russia just a few years ago passed a
anti-gay marriage bill
so so marriage in russia is between a
quote man and a woman
got to put that in quotes these days
that sounds more
neither right
that's basically neither because these
days i was trying to think when is the
last time you heard a republican
complaining about gay marriage
let me ask you
i know you've heard it of course
but when was the last time
the last time i heard any republican
online
on twitter
personally
complaining about gay marriage
i haven't heard it in years
have you
it's just a total don't care
now the concern about gay marriage is
that it would have some impact on your
life
yours let's say hypothetically if you
were a heterosexual married couple
so somehow you thought it would affect
you right i mean that was the whole
reason anybody would be uh
opposed to it it was it would have some
effect on you but did it
did it
is there any republican who says ah
everything was good for me and my family
until the gays could get married
like you you could always understand why
anybody would be afraid of anything new
no matter what it is right we're just we
have a reflex to be afraid of something
new so that makes sense
but once you've done it
and there are over half a million um
gay couples who are married
does gay cover lesbian i don't know if
that's
is that true anymore or do you have to
throw in gay and lesbian but anyway
we have over half a million people in in
the united states who were married to
the same sex
did it bother anybody
is there anybody who did you worse did
your life get worse in some way
no
no so it's very republican and this is a
compliment
this is a compliment it's very
republican to be
concerned about change
that's just a normal human reflex
but once the change has happened and you
see it's no big deal
if it doesn't affect you
and you're a republican what do you
think of it
if it doesn't affect you and somebody's
just living their life
right
it's just not your problem
so even the
lgbtq thing doesn't really define
republicans in the way it might have
before
it's very moving yeah
um
and putin also riggs elections
i don't know who's that like
allegedly
i don't know
it's tough one i can't figure it out
all right um
that tweet that i just talked about in
which i asked if putin is a republican
or democrat
um
i saw some weird things happening with
it
so there was a tweet showing a little
video of what happens when you try to
look at the tweet
and apparently the tweet shows up and
then immediately disappears with a
message that
there's there's something limiting
limiting the comments
did you see that
i don't know what that's about
do you
because i saw the video
and you can see that the tweet will show
up and then disappear
it says because you block the user
but that doesn't explain why it shows up
before it disappears
so anyway it looked like it was uh
it's because you blocked those that qt
it
but blocking them shouldn't make should
not make them show up before they
disappear
they would just be gone now and by the
way i'm not talking about my experience
i'm talking about other people's
experience from their own account
does that make a difference to your
answer people are saying it's because i
block some users
but i'm talking about somebody who did
not block those users
looking at my account
and they can't see it
it's a bug
somebody says you get that when you when
i retweet cernovich that you get that
it flashed the tweet and then
disappeared
interesting
so
i don't know what that is i i tagged
elon musk
on the video that shows some weird
things happening just ask if it was
normal
anyway keep an eye on that
um
so you know how
we all started using the word karen
and you would call somebody a karen if
they if they asked to speak to the
manager
well there's no male version of that
right
but i'm going to suggest a male version
of that
and it's based on this tweet and i
noticed a bunch of people just when i
when i tweeted the thing about putin a
lot of people did the this guy tweet
do you know what i mean
instead of dealing with the content of
the tweet
a lot of people did the this guy
doesn't this guy showing you he doesn't
know anything about russia
or this guy
said some things and then they talk
about some fake news about what they
think they said about something in the
past
everybody who starts with this guy
or or a comment about the tweeter with
no comment about the content
i said in my tweet when you see people
attack the center of a tweet instead of
the content it tells you two things
about the attacker number one they have
no counter argument and number two they
are keith olbermann usually
usually
and so i would suggest and i've started
doing this already i did it once
that when somebody attacks the messenger
instead of the message you just say okay
keith
that should be your comment okay keith
keith olbermann
you know keith olbermann right
he's the one who always attacks the
messenger
he attacks me all the time well that's
the exaggeration so keith olbermann
likes to
troll my account and attack me
personally he almost never
i think never
has attacked anything i've said
in terms of content he only attacks me
so
he's a keith
so every time you see somebody attack
the tweeter and not the message that's a
keith okay keith
um there's i saw a ukrainian tweet so
this is obviously war propaganda
this comes from a ukraine source
and the ukraine source said oil and gas
are the only things moscow exports
apart from the war
when europe switches to another supplier
it will not return to it regardless of
whether the war ends
for the world is
yes for the world russia is an
unpredictable country with no
possibility to build long-term projects
what do you think of that
is ukraine right
that once people wean themselves off of
russia oil that russia will have nothing
to export
and therefore you know they do export
some other stuff steel etcetera but for
the most part it's a energy economy
what's going to happen then
well remember this is a ukraine source
so it's propaganda by definition
um and then andres backhouse
commented and he said that uh
china and india will not want dependence
on uh
on their oil so if russia can't sell the
europe
and although they could sell to
india and china china and india are not
going to want to be too dependent
so they they don't want to be big
uh buyers
and oh peter zan says there's no way
russia will be able to re produce the
same amount of oil in the future
because of western companies have left
i don't know
i mean maybe that
has
there may be a problem getting parts and
supplies
but i don't know if it's just because
the western oil companies left because i
feel like they could just take over
those fields
so i don't know about that
but
i feel as if oil is too fungible
meaning it all looks the same and you
can sell it anywhere
actually
i don't know if russian russian oil is
good stuff right is russian oil dirtier
or good
i can't remember is russian oil
as clean as other oil
it's good right mid-grade to good
saudi oil is the best somebody says
because there is a difference in the
quality of the oil
all right i don't know the answer to
that question
but here's my take i don't think this is
true i think anybody who produces a
commodity that the world needs can just
find a way to get it there
how hard would it be for
north korea to say no that's a wrong one
how hard it would be for some i don't
know african country that has no
sanctions against it to buy all the oil
and use some of it and sell the excess
i don't know it feels like they could
just find some middle man
carve out kind of thing
it doesn't nigeria or something it
doesn't seem like it would be hard for
russia to find new markets it would just
take a while to work it out
all right um
and that ladies and gentlemen
seems to be
the end of the content
have you noticed this is a slow news day
somebody said on locals earlier that
there's a strange energy in the world
anybody else feel that
do you feel a strange energy in the
world
the news is a little slow isn't it
it's a little bit slow
so doesn't it feel like something's
about to drop
isn't this what happens when there's
something big happening
now we had some big news i mean
ukraine's big news and
uh stock markets big news
let me talk about the stock market
if you're checking your stocks every day
during
a down turn like this
don't do that
right when when the market is up i check
my stocks every day because it makes me
feel good when the market is down i
never look at my stocks
so the first thing i do is look at the
market
and then if the market is down i don't
look at my stocks i do not open it i so
you know my net worth may have gone down
20 or something
i don't know
uh because i assume it'll come back
right
so if you buy stocks you don't want to
be thinking of it in same year terms you
want to be thinking of it in five year
five year kind of thing
so
uh
you grate your teeth and buy i do think
it's a good buying opportunity
that i mean i i don't give financial
advice so don't take that as financial
advice
but if you had to place a big bet
on whether this would be a good time to
buy stocks
it'd be a pretty safe bet
i think
relatively speaking right now the safety
is depending on how long you want to
wait if you want to wait 10 years it's a
very safe bet
if you want to wait two years
you know anything could happen in two
years
tesla is down 32 since january yeah i
think the entire market needed to come
down so one of the things that people
who don't study economics get wrong
is that the market was way more
dangerous before
do you understand that
the market was in a more dangerous
situation before it went down
does everybody get that
we went from a dangerous situation to a
less dangerous situation
but the news reports it's the opposite
yeah there's a correction it's called a
correction
why is it called a correction
it's called a correction because it was
in the wrong place
and it went from the wrong place to the
right place that's what a correction is
so when you see a correction
that's not bad news
that is not bad news unless you were
planning to sell your stock you know
that year then it's really bad news but
if you're if you're buying and holding
a correction means the market is is
staying strong and it's acting the way a
market should act
so the people who have you know
economics backgrounds see a correction
then they say oh buying opportunity
that's it that's why you keep cash
if your investor pays to keep some cash
for this reason
you know i did a bunch of buying during
the bottom of the pandemic
best investments i ever made
right whoever buys now is likely to be
happy
maybe not in a year
but in 10 years they're probably going
to be pretty happy they bought stocks
today all bad
all right
um
pfizer documents is there any media
coverage no because that was fake news
do you all know that the pfizer
documents with the the negative
information
you all know that was fake news right
the reason it's not being talked about
now here's a question
why have you not seen anything about two
thousand mules uh
uh dinesh d'souza's film about
alleged
improprieties of the 2020 election
why have you not seen it on i guess it's
been banned by news newsmax
so newsmax isn't going to cover it and
you haven't seen it on fox
news why not
why do you think
uh it's being suppressed
if that's if if in fact that's being
suppressed i don't want to lead the
witness why do you think you're not
seeing it
tucker interviewed them is tucker the
only one to talk to
because i don't think it really gets
covered
by most of the opinion people
yeah
well here um here would be my
best take on that
i i think it's just too dangerous
because um
if it turns out
that it doesn't hold up
i don't know if it will or not
but if it turns out that the you know
the premise doesn't hold up
uh i don't think any major news platform
wants to be on that side
and i think that unfortunately d'souza
has enough of a history
that
even people who would be
inclined to be on his side or
are saying well
he he's a little dangerous
even if you
like the topic so it might be a little
bit
a little bit a little bit too much about
the
maker of the film and a little less
about the content maybe
so i can't read minds so i do not know
but um what is the rule that i told you
about identifying fake news that applies
to this
what is the news that applies to this
so in my book loser think that you see
behind me i give you some uh techniques
for identifying fake news one of the
techniques is this
if both the news on the left and the
right
say it's
say the same thing
it's probably true
right so if fox news says something's
true and cnn says something's true it's
probably true not guaranteed
but probably and if they both say it's
not true it's probably not true
not guaranteed but probably
but in this case this is sort of a
hybrid
because fox news is just silent on it
so nobody's saying it's true or not true
it's just whether it's too too hot a
potato to even deal with so that that
rule doesn't work in this case because
the reason they're not talking about it
is not because they say it's not true
it seems like there's not an opinion on
it
uh vaccine deaths is fake news as far as
i know
uh the i think the the problem with the
vaccine deaths is not that they happen
or don't happen because every vaccine
kills people
the question is it's not being compared
to the deaths
or the myocarditis from people who get
coveted so
typically the reason that people get
concerned about the numbers of vaccine
deaths
is because they think it's compared to
zero
like you the choice is deaths or no
deaths
so you would choose no deaths but the
choice was deaths one way
versus death another way that was the
choice
so that's why you could be fooled by the
vaccination death scare it's out of
context
and then there's some demographic issues
there of course those are real
could fox and cnn be merging no
uh
we're waiting for 50 intelligence aid
officials to denounce two thousand mules
so you'll know it's true
all right
um
what if fox is controlled opposition
you know
i don't know i i think i've spent enough
time interacting with fox news people
that i would know
if they thought it was if they thought
they were working for a controlled
opposition maybe i'm not defining the
term right
but there's certainly no intention to be
that
if you're saying it's accidentally
happening that's a different argument
um
uh can you can somebody ask me a
question there's no requirement to get
the booster shots for normal citizens
right
am i right about that
if you're an average citizen you don't
need to get the
the the third and fourth booster
it's only the military and maybe some
medical people or something i don't know
all right so we're done with that right
except in canada
medical workers
and somebody pointed out that it seems
like all the people who say they've
they're getting covered are vaccinated
and boosted but i think that's uh
that would be a
um
that would be more about what you notice
because when people do a tweet oh i got
coveted but i'm i'm vaccinated and
boosted so thank goodness
i think you see those
but you don't see the person who got
coveted and had no symptoms and didn't
say anything about it
so
so i don't i wouldn't i wouldn't say
there's any correlation with the
vaccinations yeah it's all anecdotal
ah they're not on a ventilator yeah
age-related result more vast people are
also older that's correct
all right
um
yeah and apparently the experts are now
looking at people who never got covet to
see if they have something in common
besides not being exposed so there might
be some genetic propensity
that
but here's what i suspect i suspect the
genetic
propensity
is related to your vitamin d level
so if you check your vitamin d you
probably know everything you need
yeah i did i got
just so you know
i did the original two shots which were
essentially considered one shot in in
effect it was like one shot
and i did not get a third or fourth
booster
uh have i watched the 2000 mules movie
no i but i have i finally have a link to
it so i have a link i'll be watching
that so i will be um
doing a little traveling this coming
week
so i want to give you a little heads up
um there might be one day and it might
be tomorrow i haven't decided in which i
might be a half hour early
or i might end
and a little shorter
so i'm going to do a little traveling
but
i do expect i think i'll be able to do
it every day
maybe not on the way home i'm not sure
um
i'm traveling alone
so it's actually a business trip
uh business in the sense that i'm just
gonna go somewhere and uh write because
i've got a book
a book deal and i need to be serious
about it so i'm just gonna take a week
of uh
just being completely outside my
environment and it's just a writer's
it's a writer's retreat
yeah it's just someplace easy don't
worry about it
um i don't know if i'll tell you where
i'm going because it's that's not the
important part
so he says i love traveling alone yeah
most of my traveling has been alone
because most of it has been for business
so traveling alone is very comfortable
for me uh but i don't know if i can take
i don't know if i can last a week
without human contact
it's going to be kind of hard
but that's why i wanted to be you know
somewhere where there would be other
humans in the natural environment
because i just need i need to be around
people i just don't necessarily need to
talk to them
um
yeah
traveling with kids
is not really your vacation is it
did how do you think of it when when you
do a vacation with children
that's the children's vacation
the parents are just working right
because there's so much work to put on
the vacation and they don't get to enjoy
themselves in the usual way you know i
think there could be an exception if you
like if families travel together then
the kids can get busy with each other
and the adults can do their thing
but if it's just you and your family
traveling
that's basically the kids vacation it's
not your vacation
come to miami and i'll buy you a coke
is that with a capital c
i travel with other parents
[Laughter]
yeah
all right so that's all for now and i
will
we should have a human zoo okay
there's an idea
all right
uh that's all for today i'm going to
keep it short got a lot of lot to do
today you go out and have the greatest
day ever will you do that
i think you will
and
i'll talk to you tomorrow
