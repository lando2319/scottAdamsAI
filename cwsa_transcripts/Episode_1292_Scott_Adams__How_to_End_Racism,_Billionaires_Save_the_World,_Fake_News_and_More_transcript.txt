hey everybody
come on in come on in
good job getting here on time for those
of you who did
i'm proud of you that's a good side of
character
good planning good preparation good
execution
good for you and you know the rest of
you
you could get ready quickly all you need
is a copper micro glass attacker chelsea
steiner canteen checker flask
a vessel of any time any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better really everything it's
called the simultaneous
but it happens now go
well aoc collected three or four million
dollars for
texas but that's nothing compared to
what ted cruz did by returning to
texas and warming the state directly
so congratulations texas
happy to see that you're coming out of
it and
just as we all suspected
texas is one of our good states
i i don't want to tell you the bad ones
are really don't want to embarrass you
on rhode island but texas is one of our
more
capable states and they just took one of
the
biggest disasters you could imagine took
it on the chin
and almost all of them survived there
were some tragic deaths
but uh good for texas we would expect
nothing less of you texans
have you noticed that there's no leaders
in the country anymore
is that is that my imagination there
aren't any leaders anymore
i mean there are people in charge but it
seems as if
the moment you take trump off the stage
love him or hate him there's not much
left
is there you know who
is biden really the the standard bearer
for the democrats
is nancy pelosi you'd have to go all the
way down to
i say down to but you know in terms of
rank
down to aoc before you get anybody who's
got any
any charismatic firepower any
new ideas any energy at all and i think
she's still a little
little too young to take the position
that i think
ultimately she will have which is
probably the presidency
eventually but how about the republicans
who do the republicans have well i would
have said ted cruz
toward the top of the list but you can
see that the democrats are doing a
pretty good job of
carpet bombing anywhere that ted cruz
goes
so they may be able to uh to suppress
him
yeah you can name some names rand paul
matt gates
uh tom cotton you know you can name
a number of people but there's nobody
that the whole country
says oh there's a leader or even the
whole party
you can't even get half of them so
here's what i would like to
suggest there's a real danger here
because there's a vacuum and
i don't know that the united states does
well
when there's a vacuum of leadership
right because that's sort of what gets
you in trouble because
trump came along at a time when there
also wasn't much
to compete with in terms of a a brand
that was obviously
you know a leadership brand and that
that path is still wide open yeah you
can name you know
tulsi gabbard ron desantis these are all
good names all capable people
but none of them are dominant right now
yeah
and i worry that a charismatic
figure could take advantage of this so
watch out for your next
rasputin type of person to come along
it's wide open and i say this without
joking
if i had any interest in this job it
would be dangerous
because i think i could get it
like if i actually wanted to be
president
i feel like i could do it under today's
conditions
but seriously i do not want that job
that would be literally i can't even
imagine a worse job
can you imagine a worse job than being
president
i can't and i wouldn't do the commute
all right here's the good news
i'll give you i'll give you extra good
news two good news number one
you saw the the news about the 777 with
the
bad engine well i'm very tuned into all
kind of
aircraft problems because most of you
know by now
my wife christina is a pilot so she
recently got her pilot license as well
as her
high performance rating which means that
she's qualified
to fly an airplane upside down so
i always think that's funny is you know
there
a lot of people are proud that they're
pilots it's like
uh my wife is a pilot too and she can
fly her airplane upside down
i'm just saying i don't know i don't
know if you can do that
anyway you can only do that with certain
airplanes obviously not every airplane
by the way have you ever did you ever
take a a class
in uh let's say science class or maybe
you read it somewhere
to learn how a wing creates
lift you're all science
science uh people right
trust the science can you explain to me
how it is that an
airplane's wing creates lift
in the comments i'm seeing the answer
the bernoulli principle right
the bernoulli principle and the way that
works is if you haven't had that
explained to you
let's say let's say my my phone here is
the wing
because the wing is curved on the top
but flat on the bottom
the air the airflow takes longer to get
across the top
than it does over the bottom and
therefore it's lighter
there's less air pressure on the top oh
wait for the punch line wait for the
punch line
some of you are getting ahead of me no
i'm not dumb
i'm not dumb i there's actually going to
be a twist here
wait for it wait for it all right
so as you know and every we're all
taught that the bernoulli principle says
the air going over the top
will be less air pressure than the there
in the bottom
because it's the same amount of air but
it's traveling faster over the top
longer distance i mean so it's lighter
and that means that the air in the
bottom is heavier
so it lifts the wing right
you've all been taught that it's pretty
obvious okay
now my wife gets on the plane
and then she flies it upside down
what happened to your brain
same wing and it only works one way
right because it's got to have the curvy
side up that's how the bernoulli
principle works
but my wife gets in the plane takes off
turns it upside down and flies
how let me tell you how
fake news is how the bernoulli principle
 it's obvious
do you know why it's obviously not true
have i mentioned that my wife can get in
an
airplane and fly upside down it doesn't
matter which side the wing is on
and you don't have to wonder if it's
true
just look up and watch you can watch an
airplane fly upside down just go to an
airshow
are these are these like special magic
wings that have a different shape
no no and how about an airplane that
doesn't have the
uh the rounded top if it doesn't have
the rounded top and the flat bottom it's
not going to work right
except that they exist there are
airplanes with flat wigs
they don't need that bernoulli principle
so
you watched and you know a lot of you
didn't know the answer but
did you see how many people confidently
said
oh yeah it's the bernoulli principle we
all learned that in
in science everybody knows that in fact
you could probably google it and it
would still tell you that the bernoulli
principle is what's going on
it couldn't be let me tell you what's
going on
the same thing as a water ski do you
know if
if you're if you're in the water and
you're getting ready to water ski
the reason that you rise up onto your
water ski
is because the water has more
mass you know when you're moving against
it
than the ski does so this ski is
supported by the
the effective mass of the water as
you're moving fast
same with the air that's it as long as
the air has some mass
and you've got this big wing that's
moving against it
it'll lift that's the whole story and
how many of you are having this
experience right now
are you kidding me i thought i thought
that was
obvious settled science that we've known
for decades
i learned it in school not only
was it not true ever
it was obviously not true
obviously do you know why it was
obviously not true
because you can fly upside down that's
all you need to know
all right so all i was gonna say about
this
uh there are like four uh aircraft
crashing stories and of course it's
scary if your your wife is a pilot to
hear any of these stories
but one of the things i learned from
christina
is that if your problem happens when
you're pretty high in the air
that's actually safer than if it happens
during takeoff or landing you don't want
a problem that happens
during the takeoff or that happens
during the landing that's when you
notice the problem
that's bad but if you're way high in the
air
and you lose one engine it's not as
bad as almost anything else could be
right so uh kudos to the pilot who took
it down
expertly and kept everybody safe
um but probably as long as long as the
one
as long as both wings were working and
navigation
you know the controls were working and
one engine was working
and they were high enough in the air
they were probably gonna make it
right so the odds were actually well on
their side
and and it came through good all right
um
i would like to uh propose a way to end
racism
are you ready for this um
and i'm not even joking you know that's
the sort of thing you say when
it sounds like you're going to introduce
a joke or something right
i'm not even joking i'm going to give
you an actual
legitimate practical way
to end racism now the first thing of
course you have to fix
the uh schools you got to get rid of the
teachers unions or
or at least bypass them somehow
because if you don't have good schools
you're not really going to have a chance
of everybody having at least equal
opportunity and
closing gaps in the long run but beyond
that there's also the way you feel
right there there's the real structural
stuff
but i think that we can work on that
over time but on top of that there's the
psychology of it
so i'm going to be talking about the
psychology of it
okay i just saw
maybe well i'll just describe what it is
and then you can put your own take on it
there's a tick tock video uh made by a
black man
and you have to hear that part first all
right
we still live in the world where i have
to tell you that
something was done by a black man or
you know a white woman or something so
it still matters
unfortunately you still have to like
start your story that way or else the
story doesn't make sense
so it's a tick tock video made by a
black man in which he
uh puts the audio i assume he made it
himself
puts the audio of joe biden um somewhat
in artfully describing how
some people can't get online and he made
it sound as if
minorities have more trouble operating
computers now uh
i don't think that biden meant it that
way
which i'll talk about in a minute but it
came out that way
just you know the words on the surface
came out
sounding insensitive you know poorly
constructed
and a lot of people made fun of it
because it sounded like he was
you know secretly racist and and thought
that black people couldn't
work computers or something so whoever
the
the gentleman is who made this video is
very talented
all right now again in order for you not
to get mad at me
and for me not to get canceled hear this
first part
this is video made by a black man
all right if it had not been made by a
black man it would be very inappropriate
like really really unappropriate as in a
10 and a 10
for inappropriate if anybody else had
made it but it was made by
a black guy right so this matters to the
story
and what he did was he uh he did
sort of like a reenactment almost of the
what movie is it
uh 2001 space odyssey
where they a bunch of monkeys find
an obelisk and they you know they're
amazed by the technology and they just
start going monkey crazy and going
well this gentleman who again for the
purpose of the story you need to know
is black does this hilarious
and i mean you will cry when you see it
like you'll actually cry
it is so freaking funny so the first
thing you need to know is he's really
talented
whoever he is i'd love to know who he is
but he does an impression of an actual
monkey
with a laptop on the ground and i don't
want to ruin it for you
but you have to see just his physical
comedy
of trying to figure out a laptop
making fun of joe biden while the joe
biden audio is playing on the top
now compare
compare what this genius did
because if you watch it you know it's
funny to say somebody's a genius
you know acting like a monkey and
dancing around a laptop
but you have to see how well he did it
like until you see how well he executed
the
the joke if you will you can't
understand
how talented he was um
but watching this is just hilarious and
the first thing you say is well i like
that guy
right like he seems like somebody you'd
want to hang out with because he's so
freaking funny
and i don't think that there's a more
productive way to deal with racism
now when i say racism again there's a
separate issue with structural racism
and systemic racism
you have to keep working on those but on
top of that the part i'm talking about
is this psychology just how do you feel
about each other
like what do you feel when you have any
kind of you know racial interaction
and i've never seen a more productive
way to deal with it which is just to
treat it like
people are people are idiots and it's
funny
that's it we're all idiots
sometimes right sometimes i'm an idiot
it's not like you haven't seen that
right you know there's nobody here who
can't say
that i haven't acted like an idiot
sometimes you've all acted like idiots
you've all done things that when you
look back at it you just laugh at
yourself because you're just sort of
irrational
kind of an idiot and the way
the way this video treats this issue i
don't think it could be better
all right and i think we need to
find our way back to the point where you
can
mock yourself right
you should be able to catch yourself
being somewhat like accidentally racist
and just laugh at yourself for being a
dope
like you got to get to that point where
you're not done
right we're always going to have this
bad feeling like why
why can't somebody make just a joke
about how stupid we are because we're
all stupid sometimes
right now watching the the way this guy
handled this
imagine think about how like the root
handled it you know it's a publication
um
probably there were a whole bunch of
people who said that joe biden let's
look at his history
of things he said in the past that were
racist
let's let's climb on top of him hey even
the democrats are bad and
you know he's probably a secret white
supremacist there's there's a million
unproductive ways that joe biden's
in artful language could have been dealt
with
but there wasn't a better way the the
way this and i'd love to know his name
just
because he was so talented but this was
sort of genius
sort of genius we should mock
racism and of existence
but you have to do it by mocking
yourself if you're mocking
other people maybe you're not doing it
right but in a sense the
the guy who did this prank he was
mocking biden
but sort of also you know mocking people
i would say all right well let me
uh that's the first part of my solution
to racism again
not talking about the systemic part
which needs you know
real work but the psychological part
it goes like this every now and then
you've heard me say this before
you need to uh introduce new standards
of manners you know good manners
because the world changes so for example
100 years ago you needed no standard of
manners for cell phones because they
didn't exist
but now you know you have to make you
have to come up with a standard of can
you use your phone
in a in a crowded restaurant and you
know blah blah
so given that you know racism has also
evolved every now and then maybe you
should
review your standard of just how we
interact
what is good manners and what is not and
i would like to suggest
the following standard now
by uh by analogy
you many of you know i introduced
introduced the standard recently of the
48-hour rule
which is you just give anybody 48 hours
to clarify
or apologize for something they said in
public that maybe sounded a little
sketchy to you
and then if they do apologize just
accept it and move on
so that's just a good standard for life
because people say a lot of things on
social media
it would be better if we don't crucify
everybody who makes a mistake
and i also introduced the 20-year rule
which is
if there's something in your past 20
years ago and by the way i
i would shorten that the younger you are
right at my age i'll take the full 20
years
and say all right if it was 20 years ago
i was a different person
but if let's say you're in your 30s
maybe it's more of a 10-year thing
because you're changing faster
during that period but the concept is
you shouldn't necessarily have to take
responsibility
for what a different person did which is
you when you were younger
you're kind of different right
but here's my new set of rules and it
goes like this to end racism
only the the wokeness part not the
systemic part
um that the only thing that matters
when people are saying things that you
think sound racist
the only thing that matters is their
intention
if you intend to be a good person but
you've
accidentally used a phrase that sounded
offensive
that's not so offensive is it because it
was accidental
i'll give you an analogy if somebody
bumped into you
and accidentally touched you in your
let's say crotch area
you might be startled but you wouldn't
be offended because
they just bumped into you it's just an
accident but if they intentionally
touched you there
well now you've got a fight on your
hands right so there's a big difference
between the things that happen and
things you
intend and so it is with words if you
say something that sounds terrible
but you didn't intend it that way in any
sense
i think we need to take that into
consideration but there's a second part
here
how do you trust anybody's intentions
because you can't see them right you can
hear what they say but you can't see
their intentions
so here's the rule which i would promote
going forward that number one only their
intentions matter
and if their intentions don't match the
words you have to go with the intentions
right so if there's any disagreement
with what somebody
says is their intention and their words
you should always say oh it's the
intention that mattered
right that's rule number one rule number
two how do you trust
they're telling the truth because maybe
they're just trying to cover their ass
rule number two is doesn't matter
it doesn't matter if it's true now it's
going to take a moment to understand why
that's a good rule because do you want
to live in a world
where we're crucifying each other for
misstatements or even bad intentions
or do you want to live in a world where
it's okay to improve
it's okay to be corrected it's okay to
find out that your opinion is not
socially acceptable
i would rather that somebody makes a
mistake their words maybe do match their
intentions and it's not really a good
intention
but then they're corrected then they
apologize
and then they say to themselves well
that didn't work out for me
maybe i won't do that again so i don't
care if you have bad intentions that you
keep to yourself
this is important to the concept i'm not
trying to change anybody's intentions
because that would be like brainwashing
and manipulation you can keep your
private thoughts i only care about them
when they enter the real world
and if giving you a little bit of a
spanking for what you said
that did in fact match your intentions
if that causes you not to
express this in the real world the only
place it matters
i don't care if it's happening in your
head and you're willing to pretend
that you will now be that person who
who is more polite let's say that's
that's fine with me
if if you're willing to pretend to be a
good person
even if you've got bad thoughts in your
head you're 100
okay with me because the only thing i'm
asking you to do
is to act well i don't ask you to think
well
it's not even a reasonable thing to ask
anybody nor would i want you to ask me
to
think right because that would just be
your opinion of what to think right just
as my opinion
of how you should think should be
irrelevant to you
but the way you act that might affect me
now now i'm in on that decision
so here's the standard again if somebody
says something
such as joe biden did this sounded
sketchy
doesn't matter as long as you know their
intentions are okay
if you don't know their intentions are
okay the only way to
investigate it is to ask them
and then accept whatever they say even
if it's a lie
you're better off accepting the lie
under this specific situation
right because in the real world manners
are often lies aren't they sometimes
good
manners mean sort of a polite lie
such as oh i have to get home early
because of the babysitter
maybe you're just not having a good time
right
so so good manners do include
little harmless lies we accept that as
part of
society so intentions matter
the only person who can tell you their
intentions is the person who said it
accept it whether it's true or not
because it's the action that matters
and accept apologies when they have them
so i'm going to do for biden what i
would have done
for trump if trump had said the exact
same words that biden said
that context was talking about um
underserved communities that don't have
maybe wi-fi don't have laptops can't get
on zoom
if if trump had said it in a way that
sounded like it was a racial comment
what would i be doing the next day i
would be telling you
that's obviously not what he intended
because nobody would say that
no president gets up in front of his you
know his or her own country
and says uh i think uh this group of
people
aren't good at doing stuff
that didn't happen it wouldn't happen if
trump had said it he obviously wouldn't
have meant
it that way and biden did say it
and he obviously didn't mean it that way
now we had a lot of fun
acting like he said something racist but
it wasn't his intention
i don't think there's any chance it was
his thought
i think that it was just a sort of a
gotcha and i'm going to give biden the
same past that i would have given trump
whether you like it or not all right
um anatoly lubarski
who i mentioned you should follow
because he's great at the fact-checking
stuff
he we're talking about uh why india
appears to be doing so well
but uh this is just more info this may
not be the full explanation
but it's good to know that uh only 22
of deaths in india are medically
certified
meaning a lot of people die at home or
on the streets
and nobody ever does an official doctor
cause of death
so when you're looking at india's stats
know that
in some states within india fewer than
10
of the deaths are even recorded
medically so
if you think you know how many people
are dying
from covid in india
we probably don't it may be 5 to
as as anatoly says maybe five to ten
times more than is being reported you
can't rule that out
you don't know it's true but you can't
rule out that it could be five to ten
times more than what they report
so just put that in the mix with the
other things we don't understand about
coronavirus i told you yesterday i think
on live stream that cnn had a problem
with their uh fact checker they had
hired an official fact checker for trump
and daniel dale is his name and he would
be on tv all the time
fact checking the heck out of president
trump i mean he was so busy
checking facts they he just he was uh he
was around all the time
it seemed but now that uh trump's out of
office
and i told you they they can't really
fire him because that would be too
obvious
it would be too obvious that they were
going to ignore biden's
you know unfactual statements but to his
credit
daniel dale has at least written
about biden's factual and inaccuracies
especially in the town hall
but uh i just read a uh article on
mediatek
mediaite or whatever it is that
that daniel dale hasn't been on the air
much at all or maybe not at all but
maybe
barely since biden got into office
so they're just sort of keeping him off
the air
they don't want to fire him that'd be a
little too on the nose
but maybe we'll just not put him on the
air and of course
daniel dale is not the one who decides
whether he's on the air
i'm sure he wants to keep his job and
keep doing his fact jacking
but the management decides when he's on
the air and they've decided that maybe
maybe they'll be a little less mined in
fact checking than
you might like to see all right
biden didn't go to texas
how much should we care about that
don't you think biden maybe should have
taken a visit to a disaster zone
of that magnitude i believe
didn't trump visit visit california
forest fires
i believe he did now i'm not
entirely sure that presidential visits
of disaster sites
is a hundred percent necessary
um so if biden had other things to do
you know maybe that's okay we don't know
what else he was doing
but it does feel like it's an indication
of a lack of let's say
vitality just a lack of energy
it feels like and i guess he's putting
the lid on stuff and
taking the weekends off and kamala
harris
is calling world leaders and i tell you
it looks like the cat's on the roof big
time that we're going to see a president
kamala harris
pretty soon you know i've decided that
the best name
for our system of government is a fake
newsocracy
because we're not a democracy by design
we're actually a republic
but we're not really a republic in the
sense that
our politicians go and make decisions on
our behalf because they're smart and
well informed
compared to us that's not happening
the the news drives what
the politicians can and cannot do now
it's still
legal and possible for a politician to
vote against
let's say the majority of opinion of
their own party
but as a practical matter hardly ever
happens
the reality is that the news tells the
politicians what they can get away with
because the news brainwashes the public
and then the public demands their
politicians do
what they think needs to be done but
that all comes from the news and the
news is fake
at least the political news mostly fake
so we actually have evolved into a
system
in which fake news
is the basis of our political system we
make almost
all of our decisions based on fake news
find an example that that's different
you know most of our a lot of well i
don't know most
even a lot of our coronavirus decisions
were based on things that
maybe weren't right in the beginning but
we hope are getting more right over time
certainly
uh two impeachments as much about fake
news as anything
um almost everything
that gets decided by congress is based
on bad information and fake news
spin narrative so what a weird world
that we have an actual system driven by
fake news
and that's and that is our system until
we change it
we have a fake news accuracy and here's
the weird thing
it's working pretty well
it's still better it's still better than
other systems
the fake news is literally driving our
lives
and it's still better than other systems
like it's better than a dictator
right what are the other systems what
else
yeah every democracy probably will
becomes a fake newsocracy
if it hasn't already so i uh
maybe it's the best we can do there are
more re
more reports that keep making me like
mike pence
more and more uh because
he just is so good at not causing
problems that didn't need to be caused
now again i've disagreed with him on
lgbtq stuff so i'm not backing every all
of his opinions
i'm just saying that as a human being
he's a
he's a solid citizen he was he was a
solid vice president
didn't do what trump wanted in terms of
the election stuff but i think pence
made the right decisions there
uh but now he continues to be an example
to us all
because given the situation
and the the capital assault and the
allegations that
trump wasn't caring about him etc and
the things that trump said about him
directly
pence is still not complaining
he's still not complaining nobody's
heard mike pence
throw trump under the bus is there
anybody
who had more reason to throw trump under
the bus
then mike pence nobody
nobody had a better reason to lash out
at pence
at trump and he hasn't can you think of
any other politician that would have
this much restraint
and why does he have this restraint
i'm guessing he thinks this is good for
the country i mean you don't know
maybe it's good for him too but i feel
as if pence just keeps making decisions
that he at least thinks are good for the
country you might disagree
the lgbtq stuff is a obvious example
but um i just feel like he's a
he's a model citizen i can't say enough
about
how he just continues on being like a
good person
in his view of what that takes like with
the exceptions i noted
it's worth noting all right some of the
fake news how many of you think that the
problem
in texas was from frozen windmills
just in the comments tell me how many of
you think the power problem in texas
was from frozen windmills
primarily you know not entirely but
primarily
how many of you think that's true i'm
looking at the comments now
yes yes yes not me no no no probably not
uh no partly yes no
no now the one now are you puzzled by
the fact that
there are people who consume similar
news but you see in the comments
a lot of people say no but a lot of
people saying yes
aren't we all watching the same news
the news is the news right are you
watching news that says
windmills are the problem but other
people are watching news that says
windmills are not the problem
my current understanding is that the
windmills were a smaller part of the
problem than the gas
pipelines being not weatherized
so that it was mostly a natural gas
problem and i believe that the fake news
sort of tried to sell it to you as a
failure of green technology
now my take on green technology is if
you include
nuclear energy and green technology
i'm all for it if you leave that out it
sort of doesn't make sense
economically um
but those of you who said yes and
believed that windmills were
primarily the problem how do you feel
now
knowing that that was never true it was
never true but you certainly saw it in
the news didn't you
i'll bet you saw a lot of news that said
it's it's all about the windmills
now here's here's one of those cases
where
uh looking at the news on two different
silos can help you
because i'm pretty sure that news that
is right leaning was
heavily windmill and news that was left
leaning
might have been a little less
anti-windmill
and they would have turned out to be
right in this case
so sampling both sides can always help
you
bill gates has an investment he has lots
of investments obviously but in
a hydrogen-powered airplane
company so there's somebody who's
getting pretty close
to developing a hydrogen-powered uh
commercial aircraft
zero avia now
um meaning that they they have an
aircraft they can actually fly with this
power source right now a lot of work it
would take to make it
you know operational but i would like to
once again show some appreciation
for our productive billionaires
i don't think you can say enough about
what bill gates does
you know he's building you know toilets
for africa which turns out to be the
the least glamorous job you could ever
possibly have
you know fighting malaria unglamorous
trying to figure out how to get clean
water and a poop
literally uh very unglamorous
and bill gates is taking the hardest
least
glamorous problems and dedicating his
life to solving them
for the planet he doesn't need to solve
any of these problems for himself
he doesn't have any problems that's a
lie but
he doesn't have those problems because
he's rich he can insulate himself from
all of this stuff
but he doesn't and i
i don't know how much appreciation bill
gates gets because mostly he gets
criticized for people think he's putting
chips and vaccines and
everything else but i really appreciate
the things that he's doing for the
country now and i'm seeing the
the critics here and you all think it's
a soros problem etc
um now the other one of course is elon
musk
and especially the carbon capture idea
because the thing i think that that
maybe the aocs get wrong
is that it just doesn't matter what we
do in this country
if you don't if you don't solve it for
other countries
it doesn't matter what you do so
elon musk is taking the what i'd say the
engineers approach
which is you can't make other people act
differently in other countries you just
don't have any control over that
but you can suck carbon out of the air
and maybe if india and china
don't stop creating massive amounts of
carbon
maybe there's a way to suck it out of
the air but what you're not going to do
is talk them into using different
technology
i don't think you're going to talk them
into it so if you can't
you know manage the human part you have
to solve it as a technical problem and
that's what elon musk is smart enough to
know
you're just gonna have to do you're just
gonna have to
treat it as an engineering problem
because the human part you can't solve
you know you can't tell the chinese they
can't use oil
if if they needed to eat right it's just
not a thing
so imagining that that's a thing is just
fantasyland
but thank goodness we have real
engineers
elon musk for example and you know
bill gates not technically an engineer
but has that similar kind of mind
thank goodness we have people who know
that these are technical problems
in the sense that humans aren't going to
solve them so you have to make it a
technical problem
those of you who are worried that the
carbon will be sucked under the air at
too
great a rate and doom the country that
would be kind of dumb
because you could just unplug them right
all you have to do is unplug them
if they take too much carbon out of the
air just
unplug them it's not really a big risk
all right
um i keep hammering this point only
because it's a fun mystery
that the regular flu deaths couldn't
possibly be real
because the news is that wearing masks
basically eliminated the normal seasonal
flu this year
yet when we see the differences in masks
and
lockdowns and stuff with different
places it's not obvious that the masks
make that much of a difference now i do
think the masks almost certainly make a
difference
if i had to guess how much of a
difference
masks make my non-scientific
uninformed opinion would put it
somewhere in the 20
range for the coronavirus meaning
it's not it doesn't like shut it down
that's fair to say right masks and
social distancing
they don't just shut down the virus
unless you go full china
you know the china kind of social
distancing where you
you'll be arrested if you leave your
house for three weeks
that works but do you believe that these
two things can both be true
that masks and socially distancing
effectively eliminated
regular seasonal flu at the same time
you can't even see its impact in the
statistics for the coronavirus
now as was quickly pointed out
we do know or science believes it knows
that the coronavirus is
extra extra viral it's like super extra
viral
so is that the whole answer do you think
that
once you've said that one of them is way
more viral
that now our observations are explained
that that's why the regular flu stopped
in his tracks
but the more viral one even with masks
just keeps on going
does it feel like that's true
because it could be like i'm not going
to say that's impossible
but it just doesn't pass my sniff test
right if i had heard that the regular
flu had been cut down
80 percent i'd say to myself
okay that makes sense one's more viral
didn't make that much maybe one made a
20 difference the other one was an 80
difference i get that but what if one
goes to
basically zero
yeah yeah i'm not buying that anymore
i'm just not buying that anymore because
but again it's possible right that you
can't rule it out on any kind of
statistic or scientific basis
but it doesn't feel right it feels to me
that maybe what's going on and i'll just
put this hypothesis out there
is that the regular flu deaths were
never real
the regular flu deaths were alleged to
be in the same category as
overdose deaths every year does anybody
know anybody
either directly or somebody you know who
knows somebody
who ever died from an overdose yes you
do
you do um car accidents every year
car deaths are in that same general
range as allegedly the normal seasonal
flu deaths
how many of you know somebody or know
somebody who knows somebody so you're
somewhat directly related who has ever
died in an
auto accident you all do
you all do how many of you know somebody
personally
who died of aids almost all of you
right or you know somebody who knows
somebody
so all of these other things that have
causes of death that seem to be about in
the same
number you all know of people who died
of it
but you don't know people who died of
the regular flu
okay now i i know the next thing you're
going to say
but scott scott's got the regular flu
they code it as pneumonia so it doesn't
show up
maybe maybe
or maybe people who had pneumonia and
they're going to die from it
also had the flu at the same time but it
was the pneumonia that killed them
i don't know is that even a thing i
don't even know if that's possible
but i'm just telling you there's
something going on that we don't
don't understand and i don't think
it's as simple as masks work really
really well for seasonal flu
but they only work sort of 20 good for
coronavirus it
doesn't smell like that could be true
i think the the regular seasonal flu
is i think it's
but the other possibility is that the
only people dying from regular flu
or not the only people but most of them
are people who are
so close to death that the cause of
death almost doesn't matter to anybody
you're 95 you got a cold you died
so maybe you just don't notice because
it's people who are going to die anyway
i don't know
it's a mystery here's another mystery um
when we talk about seasonality of the
flu people talk about heat and humidity
and humidity in particular there have
been studies that show
that i believe if there's more humidity
the the water in the air with the
humidity
will bring the i think it will drop
the virus to the ground faster
kind of clearer from the air because it
gets stuck on the water
but if you're if your air is really dry
and the virus is floating around and
what little water there is
that'll spread further so the thinking
is that humidity can make a big
difference to how
a virus spreads and indeed we see that
at least in our climate when people are
indoors
and it's winter and there's not much
humidity
there's more transmission but here's my
question
if it's true that indoor humidity indoor
humidity
is a really big factor what about
outdoor humidity
because doesn't the indoor humidity
follow
almost perfectly the outdoor humidity
is there any case where your indoor
humidity is grossly different than your
outdoor humidity unless you're
actively you know managing your
community it seems to me that they
correlate right
in the summer your outdoor humidity
finds its way indoors
right so wouldn't we see
that if indoor humidity makes such a
difference
wouldn't we see that anywhere that is
permanently high humidity
hawaii for example that they just
wouldn't have nearly the same problem
and do we see that maybe we do maybe we
just haven't seen the pattern
if you look at africa are we not
surprised that africa
isn't doing worse we're a little bit
surprised right
but what about mexico and is it uh
brazil
isn't brazil pretty humid brazil is
pretty humid right
so do we see do we see a clear
correlation with outdoor humidity
being all the ones with less spread
because i don't know that we see that
yeah so i'm seeing in the comments a lot
of you ending up where i am which is
it seems to me that maybe humidity was a
fake out
because it's just correlated with
something else right
if your ac only runs in the summer
it's only running when there's humidity
what if the ac is the whole problem
right what it what if the um the kind
of ventilation is what matters and
you're ventilating differently in some
some seasons than others maybe it's the
ventilation so
my feeling is given
masking and all that that probably
ventilation is going to be more
important than humidity
but i'll put that out there as just a
fact-check
situation and the question comes down to
do countries that have high humidity all
the time
universally do better with the
coronavirus and i don't think that's
true
is it but check it out
uh somebody says is christina pregnant
no i don't know why you're asking that
um hvac recirculates the problem
but there are hvacs that have uh now
um uv type of light to kill viruses
so we'll probably see more of that
somebody says
sorry adam the two are largely
inseparable the two
to what are you talking about outdoor
air and indoor
humidity so i would need more on that
comment you may be right i just need
more on that comment um
because you want a little dilbert you
know i have to be honest i've never
thought that i should reproduce
that's it and i'll tell you why my
childhood
was uh not good and
uh mostly for health reasons not not
other reasons
and i wouldn't want to bring somebody
into the world who could possibly have
anything like yeah anything i had
so uh i don't have the
i think i have too much empathy i've
told you before that i would make a
terrible
leader because a leader has to make
people do things that are bad for
them some of them so that it's good for
everybody
right so you gotta a leader has to
target people
unfortunately for like okay you soldiers
will go die
and that's bad for you but that'll be
good for the rest of the country or
you have to have more taxes but it's
better for the rest of the country
i'm not good at taking any group and
targeting them
for victimhood like i don't have the
empathy for
you know i don't have the lack of
empathy that you need
to say all right you're going to suffer
but it'll be good for these other people
and it's the same with children
i don't think i could handle having a
biological
child that i brought into the world that
had
anything like the problems that i've had
i don't know if i could handle that
emotionally maybe i could it's probably
there's probably a biological thing
which when you're in that situation
you figure it out but that's been on my
mind
all right um
yeah i think a lot more people are
deciding not to have children these days
that could be a problem
all right just looking at your speaking
of that
you know it's occurred to me that as we
watch our uh
society and civilization evolve and it's
not always evolving in a way that we
plan things just sort of happen and then
we say hey
how's that happen there's a weird thing
that's happened i've mentioned before
but
you're seeing more and more of it on
social media
given that we've lost all faith in our
news
and our institutions everything from you
know our intelligence agencies to the
fbi
i mean we're a lot of credibility has
been lost
a lot of that has to do with just
figuring out what's true
and then what to do about it and it
feels to me that
our system is inexorably
being uh drawn toward an outcome
and it looks like the outcome is
something like
internet dads i'm going to use that word
you can throw in moms right but because
there are more uh more of them are male
than female
i'll use the the sexist definition says
internet dads
and i would say i'm one of them i would
say i'm an
internet dad now in the case dad of
stepkids but still a dad
meaning that there um
there is a dad vibe which is
somebody needs to take care of the the
ugly problems
and it's always dad like if there's a
like a a snake in the garden
it's going to be dad who gets rid of it
if there's an intruder
probably dad all right now it won't be
sexist of course there's no reason that
women can't get rid of snakes
but uh just socially traditionally
some things you imagine being more dead
yeah and
i feel like there is a a group of dads
that are sort of growing up with the
internet
and that people are being are
gravitating toward them
because what what they and i'll say we
because i'm in that group what we do
doesn't happen anywhere else
meaning that we're the ones telling you
who's lying to you
who to trust who's a scam did your did
your dad do that for you
i remember my dad thought everything was
a scam
my dad thought that the house would be
had been burglarized
you know every other day hey this lock
looks like it's been jimmied
who's been playing with this lock i
think somebody's been in here
so yeah if you had a dad
who was the one telling you everything
was a con and
and maybe there's a trick behind this
it's really useful stuff
and if you didn't have a dad who was
telling you to be a skeptic about
everything
all the time you'd be a little unarmed
going into the world
without that little recording playing in
your head of i think they're trying to
put one over on you here
so i always have that recording i think
they're up to no good
and that's my dad's voice
all right um
his house was broken into all the time
in houston
sorry about that
um all right so i feel as though
you are seeing the uh the somewhat
organic
growth of internet dads and
uh maybe that's useful
we'll see all right that's all i have
for now i'll talk to you tomorrow
all right youtubers hit that subscribe
button
if you care to get notified when i'm
on yeah very soon uh periscope will go
away so youtube will be
a primary vehicle i think the locals
platform will also
have a live streaming pretty soon and by
the way
if you would like to support people like
me i'm on the locals platform
and even if you don't want to watch that
content
it's a way to way to support voices that
are not part of the
corporate badness um
somebody says youtube notifies you five
minutes late
well you know if you follow me on
twitter i if i remember i don't always
remember
i do tweet the live stream just before i
get on so if you set an alert for my
tweets
that'll be a second way to do it
the only person you can trust is
yourself no you can also trust
people who don't have any motivation
to screw you there just aren't many of
them but
they exist and i think family members
can be trusted
more often than not
um set up youtube stream further ahead
of time
maybe i don't know if that's real
all right just reading your comments and
that's all for now i'll talk to you
tomorrow
