we've got about 90 seconds before the
show
starts because okay here's what I don't
understand how could you be
commenting if you say you don't see me
well there's mystery going on here I'm
just going to forge Ed like nothing
[Music]
happened all right looking good
well welcome to coffee with Scots the
best thing you've ever seen if you'd
like to take this up to levels that even
April fools can't imagine all you need
is a cuper muger a glass of tanker chel
s a canteen Jugger flask vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dope me of the
day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it's going to happen right now
go
well I don't think I've seen so many
holidays in my life all packed into two
days we've got the trans day of
visibility we got the Easter we got the
April fools all in 48 hours pretty
amazing but uh let me give you some
updates um
update uh you probably heard about those
South America burglary gangs the gangs
that are really
they're really well equipped and they
wait for high-end houses and they they
break in well LeBron James basketball
LeBron James um his home in La was
burgled by these high-end South American
burglar uh but the good news is the
burglary was thwarted because squatters
had already moved into the house and the
squatters uh called the police and
stopped the burglars so the squatter
stopped the
burglars and then when the police found
out that the squatters uh one of them
had once posted a meme that was positive
about Trump they were immediately
arrested the squatters were and taken
away to uh it's called um January 6 jail
something some place called January 6
jail and they're all so they're all
imprisoned and
uh so LeBron got to move back into his
house but here's the ironic part before
he could move back into his own
house it was completely destroyed by
climate
change it's all true every word of that
is
true well Tesla's self-driving um
software FSD
12.3.3 is being uh pumped out to people
for a 30-day free
trial now apparently people are just
being blown away has anybody tried it
yet the new self-driving
car
no um but I hear great things about
it in other news I'll give you some
quick news of positive things here um
axio says the Biden Administration wants
to
accelerate um nuclear power Creation in
this country and part of the reason for
needing needing more nuclear power is
not only that it's green but you're
going to need tons and tons and tons of
power for AI so you better get your
nuclear you know I can't think of any
other topic where the left and the right
are in complete
agreement isn't that weird do you
remember when nuclear power was sort of
a topic of disagreement and the
Democrats were like oh no it's going to
kill us all and the Republicans were
like free markets let's get me some
nukes well it turns out everybody's in
the same side so that's good more good
news there's another test on micro doing
LSD and apparently it's really good for
your brain now micro doing means a dose
that's below the level that you would
hallucinate so something below the level
where you don't know you know what's
going on actually just makes your brain
more active and uh en it enhances the
complexity of the brain which apparently
has a whole bunch of mental health
benefits so in
theory you could and then then there's a
uh another story about is it uh
Tennessee or Kentucky which state is it
that's going to ban putting drugs in
lettuce uh apparently there's a thought
you can put vaccination type drugs into
lettuce and other
vegetables well maybe they should put a
little micro do of LST in the lettuce
and that would cure all the batshit
crazy people who are ruining the
country but if that doesn't work here's
another Trend there are Mental Health
Urgent Care sites for children popping
up so the mental health of our children
is so bad that a whole industry has
popped up just to give children mental
health I would like to make a suggestion
before you give your
child um medication and therapy and all
that I feel like the first thing you
should test is moving them to a good
environment you know what what if you
took a kid who was having mental
problems say all right here's the deal
we're going to make you eat only healthy
food you you'll not have your
phone and we're going to put you with
other kids your age so you always have
some friends and you'll meet some people
and you'll have you'll do some
activities it'll be fun you're going to
spend a bunch of time Outdoors you're
going to get a little exercise every day
and then at the end of the month we're
going to see how much mental health
problems you
have because I'm pretty sure the mental
health problems are coming from the
environment so I don't imagine that
having these Mental Health Urgent Care
sites is going to treat the source of
the
problem so I got a real problem that
we're
adding medical stuff to other stuff and
maybe it doesn't make things better now
I some people are just going to need
emergency help so it probably will save
some
lives but I don't know that it gets to
the root
cause here's a statistic I saw that I
can't believe is
true there's a list of
95 uh food food plants in other words
plants that process food from the United
States
that have been destroyed since Biden
took office is that possibly true that
95 different food processing plants from
meat processing to other processing 95
of
them all all different things like fires
and various
problems how in the world is that an
accident if it's true so I guess my
first question is is that true and and
is it normal
may maybe we have so many food
processing plants because you know it's
a big country maybe 95 is just you know
2% of our
plants if it's only 2% it's probably
just a normal
year if
it's if it's you know half of all of our
food processing plants we have a real
big
problem Scott lives under a rock
you you
you all caps
guy now I've been uh I do follow the
news and I'm aware that many um meat
processing plants were destroyed during
the pandemic Etc so I knew that it was
happening what I don't know and you
still don't know you put
it in the comments why why don't you
show me how much you know what percent
of the of the food processing plants
does this does this represent because
otherwise you fallen for the idiot uh
trap the idiot trap is somebody tells
you the number without the percentage
right did you fall for the idiot trap
where you heard the number but not the
percentage looks like you did oh caps
 so come back to me with what
percentage of the food that is and then
we'll talk about whether it's a big
problem okay but all this Scott has been
hiding under Rock he's just finding out
Scott is just waking
up God you're
stupid all
right um Gavin new was going to roll out
to 500 surveillance cameras in Oakland
to help battle the crime
there now here's a prediction I made in
my book The dilber Future back in the
9s I said that crime would someday be
impossible because we would just detect
all the crimes so it would be no point
in committing them and I also said it
would be because cameras would be
everywhere you you could pretty much
anticipate that the cost of surveillance
would go down the practicality of it
would go up as crime went up we would
add more cameras but here's here's the
part of the prediction that hasn't
happened but I'm pretty sure it
will every interior space is going to
have a camera except maybe
bathrooms every interior space will have
a
camera but it'll be
encrypted so if somebody stole your C
stole your camera they couldn't see what
happened in the room including the
government even the government wouldn't
be able to crack the encryption so the
fact that the camera is recording
everything you'd still have all your
privacy the exception would
be if there's a chord order so let's say
somebody gets murdered in a room that
would be the one case that the police
can say all right you have to unencrypt
that camera between these hours and
these hours and then the
homeowner can unencrypt it because they
would have the
key now you might say to yourself Scott
I hate that I hate that with a passion
it will be abused yes it would be I'm
not saying it's a good idea it's a
prediction prediction is not that it's
good or bad it's just going to happen
because whenever whenever a technology
can be used it will be if it's possible
and it looks like somebody's going to
think it's a good idea there'll be
plenty of it yeah people might be quite
willingly putting putting them in their
own house to keep them
safer um I mean most of the sex crimes
happen in rooms right almost all sex
crimes happen inside indoors you'd
almost get rid of them all right uh
there's a report that people are moving
out of Florida because they weren't so
happy after they moved there during the
pandemic so a lot of pandemic people
moved down there and said oh I'll get go
to where there's freedom and now I guess
half a million of them is have decided
not so much the complaints they have are
that let's see homeowners insurance
rates have gone up
40% since last year wow $6,000 a year
just for home insurance that's of course
because of
the environmental
risks car insurance is more than 50%
higher than the national average why is
that why would car insurance cost
more in
Florida why does that make sense does
anybody know why that makes sense I
don't um and uh apparently it's one of
the more expensive states to buy home
now with prices up 60% since 2020 what
it went up 60% since
2020 holy cow now I think this Florida I
I think the Florida story is a fake
out I think it's just an anti- Red State
story because here's the
thing the people who moved because of
the
pandemic moved because of the pandemic
and then when the pandemic is over what
would you expect to happen wouldn't you
expect a lot of people would say I moved
here for the pandemic the pandemic's
over and I'll go where I like the
weather better you know makes perfect
sense to me I don't think it's
necessarily a comment about Florida and
of course it's super hot there people
found that out you know if you've never
been to
Florida let's say you grew up in some
place that didn't have much humidity and
somebody said hey if Florida's hot it's
like sometimes 100 degrees and you're
from California and you're like that's
not so bad yeah we we have some we have
some days that are 100 degrees too the
difference is in California when it's
100 you can still walk to your car and
survive at least you can get in your car
and drive somewhere and get out you can
live if you're in Florida you walk out
in that humidity you can barely make it
to the
car have you ever seen my impression of
somebody walking outdoors in Florida
during the
summer all right let let me give you my
impression of a Californian walking out
in the summer all right it's
100° that's
California here's a Floridian walking
outside oh
God right it's
I'm just saying it's
different so stop asking me if I'm
moving from
California they going to have to raise
my rates my tax rates a lot more than
that all right uh there's a documentary
called uh climate the movie and some say
it obliterates the climate scam and it's
being shadowbanned on YouTube and
filmmaker Martin Durkin has has really
brought the goods that's what people say
has anybody seen it I haven't seen
it yeah
well um I warn you of something called
the documentary
effect and the documentary effect is not
only things you don't like it's also
things that agree with your your
opinion just because something is super
super persuasive in a documentary
what did that tell you let's say you go
to a documentary and it tells you
something maybe that's different from
what you've heard and it's really got
the receipts I mean there's there's
Witnesses there's science there's
studies and they really bring it when
you're done what have you
learned what have you learned from the
docu any documentary doesn't matter what
it is what have you learned from the
documentary when it's
over there's only one thing you can
learn
documentaries are
persuasive that's it there there's no
other thing you can learn from a
documentary because a documentary is not
credible by its
nature you can only learn that it felt
persuasive that's it there is nothing
else you can find because all
documentaries are persuasive otherwise
you would never get to see it if it was
not if it were not persuasive it would
you know nobody would even mention it
you never would have heard of it so by
the time you've heard of it it means
it's persuasive it does not mean any of
it's true and the the I always use the
competing Michael Jackson documentaries
they're both really persuasive they say
opposite things so what are you left
with the only thing you're left with is
wow documentaries are persuasive you
don't learn anything
else in my opinion climate uh alarm is
overdone and I'm not believer of the
climate change narrative completely not
completely
um and it's entirely possible that
everything in the documentary is true
and it captures the situation perfectly
that's possible but you would have no
way of knowing so you as a viewer only
know that you're persuaded you don't
know anything else just be careful of
that
okay um I was having a little uh free
will conversation online today as I
often do and Leo 300 who's a user says
that Free Will is my Achilles heel it's
my achilles it's a thing I get wrong
that I don't understand free will he
says which is an odd way to say I'm
right but
um I just wanted to clarify
something I'm very much in favor of
people who pretending Free Will is
real because that's always worked
so we have you know 300,000 years of
pretending Free Will is the thing and it
allows us to create laws that we agree
with and punish people who do bad things
and you know it gives us
tools so as long as it works keep doing
it but it is nonsense all right
um the you're all familiar with the
double slit experiment
right then let me teach you another
thing about persuasion I'll tell I'll
I'll review what that is before I go
on here's a uh a a lesson on
persuasion you can't persuade people of
anything until they're
ready and what makes person what makes a
person ready is all the other things in
the
environment so you have to have an
environment that supports the new
understanding or else people will look
at all the other things in the
environment and say maybe not so so you
can only
persuade when the timing is
right and the
timing is
right for you to understand that we are
living in a
simulation now many of you saying my God
not again not this simulation thing well
it's because of the timing because of
everything else is
happening I can finally convince you
that you live in a simulation and that
is proven it's
proven what would you need to to know
where a simulation I'll give you an
example how many of would you agree with
this suppose we could prove that history
is
imaginary and only created when you need
it what if we could prove that would
that tell you you were in a
simulation because if we live in
something like what we imagine then
history is how we got here and it's all
real I mean it's not real at the moment
but it was real at one point if I could
convince you that history is created in
the present it's not something that
caused the present but if I could
convince you that the present creates
history wouldn't that tell you you were
in a video game because that's the way
we build video games in a video game you
know if a character suddenly appears
that had never been there the character
has a history like you imagine the
character was born or whatever in the
simulation not in the real world
so if I could prove to you that history
is in fact created on
demand you're ready and that's what the
double slit experiment does so you get
the the fast exp the fast version is you
have two slits you you put photons
through it if nobody's watching
it they uh they create one pattern but
if people are watching it it creates a
different pattern so apparently
observing it or measuring it in a way
that can be observed later changes what
happened in other words it changed the
past it changed the past so if you can
change the past and we've confirmed
it um that means we're in a
simulation and somebody said Can reality
exist without an observer well I went to
Google and I asked that it said
can reality exist within an observer
here's what Google
said according to quantum physics it's a
commonplace notion to think that the
Universe exists out there without us
where out us there to live in it and
observe it however in the realm of
quantum physics uh an observer
independent universe is simply
impossible so according to one of the
top answers on Google
the universe only exists because we
observe
it and the parts we haven't observed
don't
exist yeah we're a simulation there's
really no question about it we're
absolutely a
simulation now how do you explain the
fact that we seem to be living in
different
simulations because we're a simulation
so the simulation you're living in
doesn't even need to be the same as mine
so you can live in a simulation where
uh Trump is Hiller and I can live in one
where he's just
funny and there's no there's no conflict
unless we're talking to each other and
then we decide the other one needs to be
in jail or something but otherwise we go
we go on with our life with our
completely different versions of reality
and it almost never
matters until it's some political thing
and then we we notice that we're not
living in the same
reality how about the fmy Paradox you
know the fmy Paradox
um scientist named fery said if there's
so many aliens in the universe where are
they all where are all the aliens in
theory there should be plenty of aliens
because space is so big and we can see a
lot of it and the answers that they give
are like this um maybe life is so rare
that it only flashes into existence for
a million years and goes away so it's
just so rare there's a reason we don't
see it
maybe it's because um there aren't many
planets that can support life maybe it's
because it's hard for us to to see them
they're just too far away maybe they're
hiding so these are the answers that
people give to why we haven't seen any
aliens let me give the more obvious
simple clear
answer we're a
simulation we're a simulation of the
planet Earth there is nothing else
there doesn't need to be anything else
our simulation requires nobody else just
like a video game if you buy a video
game that's you know let's say a battle
on an island the video game did not
create the rest of the world it just
traps you on the island so you think
that's all there is have you noticed
that we can't go to the edge of the
universe you know speed light problems
and all
that all you have to do is prevent
people from seeing outside the realm of
things that are created and they'll
think they've seen everything because
they can't imagine what's on the other
side no the firmy Paradox the um quantum
physics the double slit experiment and
every other observation is pretty clear
at this point that we're a
simulation now why do I say that this is
the time the reason that this is the
time to tell you this is that you've
observed that you don't live in an
objective
reality we we now see through politics
and through the largely through Trump's
introduction into politics that
everything is fake we can see that all
of our history is imaginary it's just
somebody wrote a book and you believed
it and it became part of a course you
maybe some of the names and dates are
true but largely history is made up if
you don't think history is made
up how do you think they're going to
write the history of the last five years
we don't agree we don't agree on the
most basic
facts was there an Insurrection on
January 6 we don't agree did uh Osama
Bin Laden uh take down the Twin Towers
well that's the official
story if you go into the real world
you're going to find a lot of people who
don't agree with the official story I I
you I don't know what to believe
there so the fact that we've seen that
everything we thought we were sure about
is fake we've seen that all the
scientists are bought off and not
credible we've seen that 100% of our
institutions are fake we see that the
government is trying to tell us that
aliens are in a warehouse somewhere we
know that's not
true we're in a
simulation it's
obvious all
right and we ignore the past ones
inconvenient uh Brandon stru lies to
remind us he was one of the January 6
people who got in legal trouble uh he
reminds us in 2016 the uh the left had a
whole campaign to get members of
Congress to not certify Trump as
president there was a petition there
were TV shows or advertisements and they
all acted like it was perfectly
reasonable to not let Trump become
president even though the vote had very
clearly elected him and they thought
that was perfectly legitimate
it was just too much of a risk and
yet only a few short years later we
pretend that that history doesn't
exist it's only because we remember it
that it
exists your history books are going to
erase this
 the the history books that tell you
that on January 6 was an Insurrection
are not going to tell you that the
Democrats did the same damn thing the
last election because that ruins the
narrative so you can see in real time
that the history books are being faked
or or you can guarantee that they will
be or or what are you going to teach
kids two separate histories oh here's
the history these guys say here's the
history that no they'll get one history
and it will be the common
narrative so we'll ignore the history
when it's not true and I like to ask
this question every now and then because
again this didn't make as much sense a
year ago or two years but after what
we've been through and finding out
nothing is true and everybody's lying
all the time I'll say it
again um what are the odds that our
election system in this country are the
only institutions that are not
corrupt because we found out every part
of our government pretty much all
corporations are just you know woefully
corrupt the news completely
corrupt but why why do we believe that
the elections are the only exceptions
and and we actually we actually tell
each other oh yeah the elections are
good the only thing we know the
financial world is completely corrupt
everything else is corrupt you know look
at the war in Ukraine do you think you
get the right story about that no it's
all corrupt how about Joe Biden all
corrupt right so law fair against Trump
all corrupt so everything from the doj
to the FBI to the CDC to the FDA to
Congress all
corrupt but you can look me in the face
and tell me that the
elections are completely good because
the courts didn't find a
problem the courts didn't find a problem
with
OJ at least in a criminal
sense the criminal court said OJ was
innocent so I guess he's innocent of the
crime now let me ask you this we were
told recently that China has already
penetrated most of our infrastructure in
this country and all they have to do is
push a button and they can turn off our
water and power and and emergency
services do you think that's true your
government told you it's true is it true
China's already hacked into everything
they can just turn us off well why is
China so good at hacking into all that
basic highly secure infrastructure but
they can't get into our elections what's
up with
that is that because the elections are
unusually
secure I don't know the details but it
seems to me that every Precinct is
responsible for their own election
security am I right and that there's
probably some one or two people trained
to make sure that the
machines are
secure and that has current software and
that is not unlocked so you can't put a
thumb drive into it do you think all
those people working in all those
precincts every one of them they did a
good job on infrastructure
security do you think that 100% of the
people who work for the uh the people
who make the machines for voting do you
think every one of those persons we know
for sure is not a spy no
insiders how would you know how would
you know you'd have no way to
know so so uh yeah if you think the
election systems are the only things in
America that aren't
corrupt I don't think I can talk to
you if if your proof is that I don't
know of anything specifically that's
corrupt I can't talk to you that that's
nonsense how would I
know all right well the one thing I
learned from the Democrats is that
nothing can be considered true until
it's proven true in a kangaroo
court
I saw a
uh I saw a news bit that said there's
some poll showing I think just the news
had it some poll showing that people
will still support Trump even if he's
convicted of a crime is there anybody
here who didn't know that the the
Democrats keep saying that Trump will
lose support if he is railroaded by some
lawfare stupid crime who believed that
from the first moment I heard that I was
like really somebody believes that he'll
become less popular if he gets lawed
into jail
no that's not the way anything works if
you laware him into
jail he could be
dictator I mean it could give him so
much power he could just he could
actually become the dictator they fear
if you want him to become a dictator put
him in
jail if you want to have something like
you know some kind of real government
don't but don't be surprised if he gets
more popular if he gets
convicted um Harvard uh applications
have uh dropped so I saw the word
plummet used so far fewer applications
now I assume that's because of the
anti-Semitism but also probably because
of the wokeness in general and here's
the good news Harvard is on track to be
as diverse as the uh
hbc's the hbc's yeah the historically
black colleges but Harvard is on track
to equal their diversity so good job
Harvard um and so and so is the military
turns out that white people have stopped
joining the military because the
military doesn't like white people and
won't give them the same opportunity so
they stopped
joining but the good news is that the
military also lowered their um their
intelligence bar so they can get the
number of people it will just be less
less intelligent so we'll we'll have a
very diverse military and Harvard's
looking good too so good good going guys
good work on the
diversity um let's
see so there's a uh Mass brainwashing
operation that's going into effect uh
that involves some uh video games for
local schools so your friendly
government is giving away these video
games to help uh children find
disinformation so as Mike Ben accurately
calls them these are nudge based
psychology manipulating video games
nudge meaning it's not right on the nose
they're not saying
kids don't believe Donald
Trump but that's what they're
saying it's to nudge them into thinking
they made up their own mind about what
they can trust do you think that any
truth is being told to these children
that the do you think that the video
game tells the kids that the news is
completely fake and has been for decades
do you think that the video games tell
them that the Republic ended probably in
the 60s of course not
it is it's pure
brainwashing now I'm in favor of
brainwashing
children because the alternative is way
worse they become you know wild animals
or something so you got to do a little
brainwashing but I wouldn't brainwash
them this
way uh Mark Andre is saying that uh in a
post everything you read makes sense if
you simply translate experts as crazy
people have you seen that the frame of
crazy people or as I like to say batshit
crazy people is becoming far more
verbally noticed in other words people
are saying out loud wait a minute I'm
not sure this is a political
disagreement this looks like somebody's
got a huge mental problem and they're
acting like it's something about
politics so we do have to we have to
stop treating mental illness like a
difference of opinion it's not it's not
it's just mental illness and if we're
divided yeah look how divided we are as
a country seems like the most divided
we're also the most mentally
ill I don't think there's that much
division among the people who have not
sought therapy for mental illness in
other words if you put it in the same
room all the people who do not have any
form of mental illness
and you said all right what do you what
do you all believe can you get along it
wouldn't be much of a
problem basically the non-mentally ill
people are generally willing to consider
other information and you know maybe
change their views if they hear a better
argument that sort of thing but the
mentally ill are just going to go right
to the
wall yeah and and the eyes have it the
mentally ill
eyes so more on this the the more
important people the more that important
people say it's a crazy person problem
the better wa we
are Robert F Kennedy Jr is reminding us
that all our economic data is
fake
um that's the short version so
everything about jobs you know Biden
keeps saying oh economy is great
inflation's down jobs are good it's all
technically true but fake yeah there are
more jobs but they're mostly government
jobs and part-time work so not exactly a
sign of a healthy
economy so economic data mostly fake and
there are lots of examples I don't need
to give you the examples but if you
believe anything the government says
about inflation or
jobs you probably
shouldn't 60 Minutes had a big feature
on hey you know that secret Russian
weapon that was hurting all those
Embassy people and then studies were
done to conclusively find that there was
a mass hister and there's no weapon
whatsoever well soon after it's debunked
completely 60 Minutes has somebody on to
say totally true oh is it true it's so
true you can't even believe it we it's
true there's no picture of it
interestingly nobody's ever seen one
weird nobody's ever seen one it's sort
of like those UFOs nobody's ever seen
one so just when we need to get to
Ukraine funding there's a secret Russian
weapon and 60 Minutes uh which many
believe is in the pocket of big Intel is
a given the other that story now have I
mentioned the documentary effect Now 60
Minutes is sort of a long form news so
it's a documentary within within the
show so if you watch watch this Russian
secret weapon episode on 60 Minutes
would you come away thinking that it's
probably
true I think so I didn't watch it but
I'll bet you would because a lot of
people said to me today but Scott did
you see it did you see it it's all true
no if you watched 60 minutes and they
spent let's say 15 or 20 minutes telling
you there was definitely a Russian
secret weapon what can you conclude when
you're done
what's the only thing you can conclude
after seeing hardcore really strong
evidence that this Russian secret weapon
exists the only thing you can conclude
is that documentaries are
persuasive that's it nothing else
there's nothing else you can conclude
you you have departed all rational
thought if you say I listen to a
documentary or listen to a segment on 60
Minutes and it changed my mind that's
not good thinking because you shouldn't
be changing your minds based on one side
of a
topic so I'm going to say no I think
it's still obviously a fake news and I'm
not even going to look at the
details speaking of fake news you've
heard of the thing called the fog of War
do you remember that alifa hospital it
was supposed to be over a massive
command and control structure and so
that's why it made sense that the
Israelis went in there
hard well they didn't destroy Aliva but
you know did some damage but now it's
completely destroyed because they did go
and root out some other homas people
some people are reporting that all of
the hospitals are now destroyed uh and
the anti-israel people are saying well
that's proof that they always meant to
be destroying everything and of course
Israel would say no there totally was a
massive command and control center there
and they keep using them and as long as
they keep using them to defend
themselves we're going to keep knocking
them down so there you've got two
stories from a war zone what have you
learned two opposite stories what have
you
learned if what you took away from that
is well I trust one of those sides
you've learned
nothing fog War you can't trust any of
this you can't trust Israel when they
say everything was fine and you can't
trust the other side when they say it's
all torturing and raping they can't stop
torturing and
raping don't believe any of it in in in
the middle of a
war none of this is credible none of it
I will tell you I I'm pretty skeptical
about the
massive um Command Center under elifa
clearly there was something down there
it was obvious it was used for something
there there are other people who say the
hospital itself used them but then other
people point to all the weapons who
found there and then other people point
to the fact that really there weren't
many weapons found there for a massive
command and control center so I don't
know what to believe um I would say you
can't believe the Israeli government in
a time of War you can't believe Hamas in
a time of war and you can't believe the
United States government in a time of
war the only thing you can be sure of is
looks like there's some more a lot of
War so I'm not going to back either side
at this point they're on their
own uh I think we have an answer to the
Mark Cuban
mystery have any of you been wondering
what's wrong with Mark cubin because he
keeps very publicly defending
Dei and that is in conflict with that
conflicts with the fact that he's also
clearly
smart how how can you be
smart and have an opinion that's so
opposite of common
sense now many many different uh
theories have been offered but I think
we have an answer finally some people
say he's just pandering just pandering
to the other side you know just trying
to be a good guy in public some say he's
misinformed you just didn't know enough
about the topic some say he's uh it's
some kind of a performance or like an OP
or like there's some bigger purpose to
it because it couldn't make sense on its
own
um I've also suggested early on that
maybe he was just supporting his own
companies so it could be that he has a
diverse Workforce in his own companies
and he's just being a good just being a
good CEO and making sure that he
supports them as vocally as they
can but none of these sounded too
satisfying did they well here's the New
Evidence so Mark Cuban posted this he
said I was with a group of people who
were proponents of of Dei they asked me
what I would do to Res reduce the
resistance to Dei and Mark said I told
them to do a search and replace in all
of their materials for quote Equity of
outcomes and then change that to quote
equality of
opportunities don't let your head
explode yet hold on every single person
agreed that they never should have used
equality of outcomes and said they
should they should change the
term do you understand
now in other words Mark Cuban's
understanding of Dei was the opposite of
what Dei
is so he said if you change it to its
opposite then everybody would agree it's
good yes that's true if you change it to
its opposite it would start to make
sense now here's what I think happened
because he did all this
publicly um I mean he literally said if
you change it to its
opposite that then we all agree it's
good he didn't know that
before how is it possible he didn't know
that here's my hypothesis we can't read
his mind so we don't know and I think if
you asked them you still wouldn't
know because it's a sort of situation
where you're never sure what you're
hearing so I think asking is a waste of
time but here's what it looks like and I
would say this is something that's
happened to me on different
occasions were you ever sure you
understood a topic and then you got
halfway in and you realized uhoh did I
completely misunderstand this topic and
then you say to yourself it would be
kind of awkward for me to say I
completely misunderstood this topic like
I actually had it backwards that's
completely
misunderstanding and what do you do then
well then you look for a clever weasy
way that you could be completely wrong
but really right and it looks like he's
taken that path oh I was 100% wrong but
in a way that matters if you change
words I was completely
right but the good news is he found his
way
there so I think I think the the
explanation that he's stupid can be
ruled
out are you with me given that he found
the right
place can we rule out
stupid he found the right place and it
looks like he you know took into account
opinions and maybe found out more about
it and everything now here's where he
probably went
wrong and this could have to do with not
um not having much experience as an
employee so his experiences as a boss
it's very
different here's what every employee
knows if you were to say hey that's a
good idea we're going to change this
from um we're going to change this from
saying um equality of uh what of
outcomes we're going to change it to
equality of
opportunities so hey
managers um we just want to make sure
that you have a quality of opportunity
so then a year goes
by and you go into your uh your review
with your boss and your boss says hey
have have you how have you done on
diversity and you say really great
excellent um made huge strides um I've
given more opportunities to more people
than ever before so many opportunities
and then the boss says that's great so
what is your current you know diversity
situation
and you say well none of them took the
job because you know turns out they
weren't qualified as other people so the
diversity didn't change whatsoever but
man did I I nailed it I gave so many
opportunities I I did recruiting in
inner cities you know we we hired
somebody just to scan for making sure we
didn't miss anybody opportunities all
over the place you should give me a big
big raise for all the opportunities I
created and the boss
says I have to explain why our diversity
didn't
change how am I going to explain that to
my
boss so I'm not going to give you a
bonus for not increasing
diversity and then the employee says oh
hold on you told me very
specifically that it's not about the
outcomes you said it's about the
opportunities and I just told you I
killed it in Opportunities I made so
many
opportunities and then your boss doesn't
give you a bonus and what do you do the
next
time next year you just hire everybody
you can who looks different than the
people you have because that's how you
get a bonus and if the boss says I'm
concerned that you hired people of lower
capability you look at them and you
say well that's pretty
racist I I checked everybody myself
they're all equally good
so something wrong with you
racist right so I think he thinks you
know probably Mark thinks that in the
real world if you focus on opportunity
that that's what you get you get lots of
opportunity and that that naturally
creates more
diversity
no not in the real world in the real
world people will pursue what they're
measured on and if they're measured on
diversity they're going to pump up that
number hiring whoever they walks in the
door you know with within
reason so that's my theory I think he
just got caught not not with a little
blind spot and he's trying to crawl out
of it now that's what it looks
like well meanwhile one of my old
schools UC Berkeley is accused of uh
being a racist because there's some kind
of a
uh what is it they're they're banning
white people from the Community Farms I
guess brookley has some kind of
community Farm you can't go there if
you're
white okay um and then uh there's been a
promise to review all of the UC systems
to see if they have other systemic
racism against white people huh I I
wonder if there's any other systemic
racism against white people in
Berkeley huh if they check really hard I
don't know maybe they could find some
maybe no Berkeley is a cesspool of
racism and uh good luck get rid of
it Jonathan ha is making a lot of news
with his new book called The anxious
generation in which I'm summarizing it
you know too much but basically the idea
is that the uh kids today are all
anxious and have mental illness because
uh combination of their phones plus less
normal play so it's two things it's not
just the phone it's also that it's
substituting you know in some to some
degree play and that play is
important and his critics are saying but
but but all you're showing is
correlation not
causation now that's what I always say I
always say maybe it's just a coincidence
maybe something else is happening but uh
Jonathan hate in a very long post
pointed out the many many studies he and
his partner looked at um and that some
of them would have been just correlation
but there's a lot more that teas out
causation so the fact that he was very
very uh directly looking to find
causation and not be fooled by
correlation is a good sign so I think if
I had to bet on it I would bet that hate
is right and his critics are wrong
because he says his critics focused on
you know uh two studies or one study
where indeed he would agree uh causation
was not
demonstrated but he had lots of other
science that shows it was so I can't
speak to the science I can only say
there's a disagreement there but
remember my uh my BS
filter number one best BS
filter does the science match
observation yes
you don't have to be a scientist to look
at a kid with a
phone and know what's
happening I think it's the dumbest thing
in the world that there's any question
about it like I'm glad that there is
science but this is very squarely in the
category of you could have just asked
God because it's all really really
really obvious to every single
Observer who has a kid and doesn't know
that the phone is destroying their
brains
nobody every every parent knows that
it's
obvious well let's see what else is
happening um turkey had some elections
um local elections and weirdly their
leader uh erdogan his party just got
destroyed in a landslide so you think of
turkey as a sort of a strongman
dictatorship but they're weird they're a
weird
hybrid so they do apparently they like
leaders who are strong leaders but they
still get elected and apparently the
elections are somewhat real so uh the
the national election follows I guess in
their system and the smart people are
saying erdan is just going to get wiped
out and that he will not be the
leader I don't know so apparently there
it looks like there's a move back toward
secular government and away from more of
a religious
take on
it we'll keep an eye on that I'm I'm
going to trust Ian Bremer when he
characterizes elections in Turkey as
mattering so we'll see if uh see if he
does get replaced that could change a
lot you unless you're really plugged
into geopolitical stuff it wouldn't
necessarily be obvious to you that
turkey makes a difference that makes a
difference CIA influence I don't know
hard to imagine they weren't
there all right ladies and gentlemen um
I have a little announcement just for
the locals people so uh before we after
we sign
off uh let's see if you have any
questions first is there anything I
missed but I've got some uh just Insider
stuff for just the locals people we're
done so I'll be turning off YouTube and
Rumble and X so so only the locals
people will see the good
stuff all right nothing else all right I
think we're good so I'm going to say
goodbye now to YouTube and Rumble and
X couple of clicks
and okay I think they're gone all right
so you know I only tell you behind the
subscription window the good
stuff and so far
so far you haven't shared any of it
which is kind of amazing like the number
of things I've told you that never got
outside the
locals so here's a good one this will be
like the best one so far so I got a text
from um Dan scavino in the uh the uh
Trump um campaign it turns out they
actually are considering having a
rotating press secretary
and they're looking for people who would
be willing to come in and just do it
once or maybe on a regular basis and
they asked me if I'd be interested now
it's all
preliminary but they asked me if I'd be
interested in being one of the press
secretaries just a guest you know not a
regular one but like a guest so maybe
coming in like once a you know once a a
month or something they don't have all
the details but um so I told them uh yes
so if Trump win
um I'll actually be one of the press
secretaries all right so make sure that
uh make sure you don't tell anybody okay
just keep this within
locals and I don't want this I don't
want this one to get out okay all right
so let me close this now and um I will
talk to you all
later
