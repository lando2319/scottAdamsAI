hey everybody
are you ready for the peak experience of
your entire existence
well i hope you're ready because it's
coming at you right now it's called
coffee with scott adams and
it is renowned around the entire solar
system as the best thing that's ever
happened to anybody
and if you'd like to take it up to the
next level
and you're the kind of people who do
that
you know who you are
you do
and may i add
you look
extra sexy today
and uh
if you'd like to take that up a notch
too all you need is a couple of
margarita glasses tanker gel style
canteen joke of flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it can stop a russian invasion
if you don't think so watch this go
all right take the sip now look around
look around the room
do you see any russians invading you
no
no you don't and that's what i promised
you
i promised you that would be the case
never break a promise
well there's a
new tv series on on
amazon prime
that
i didn't think you could even make a
show like this
talk about provocative
you know you've seen some provocative
content lately but wow
uh let me describe this and you tell me
if you think this would
honestly i didn't think you could even
put something like this
on any kind of a streaming service
in 2022
because it's not like these are backward
times when we were less awake and aware
i mean this is 2022 damn it and there's
a streaming service who thought this
would be okay
to stream to the american public
now let's see if you're as disgusted by
this as i am
it's called reacher
and involves a man
who plays the role of a hero
it's 20 22 people
you do not have this kind of a show with
a man
as the main character
doing heroic things like beating people
up who deserve it
that my friends is a 90s kind of
attitude
this this character should be played
by a black woman who weighs no more than
95 pounds
and that 95 pound black woman
if she were
in the role that she was born to play
of reacher she would be beating up 10 12
people uh
simultaneously because that's what you
can do when you have skills
and you weigh 95 pounds
so i'm a little shocked
that there could be this
muscular white guy
starring in a series and that doesn't
seem right
anyway rasmussen has a poll
uh that says that 66
roughly two-thirds
of people polled in america
um say biden should take a cognitive
test
but more interesting uh is the
percentage that say biden is mentally
and physically up to the job of
president
anybody want to take a
i don't know take a guess
about the
approximate you don't have to get the
exact number
but approximately just off the top of
your head how many people do you think
would say as a percentage
that biden is mentally and physically up
to the job of present
wow you're guessing is excellent
may i compliment you on your guessing
it's 27
look how many of you were within two
percent
give yourselves a pat in the back when i
told you
that you were sexier than normal
what i left out was smarter than normal
and i think you can see it clearly in
these answers yes without the benefit of
any scientific polling
each of you knew that approximately a
quarter of the public would say that
biden is cognitively just fine
speaking of cognitive things
i absolutely loved a twitter thread you
can find it in my my feed
from a cognitive scientist scott barry
kaufman
who you should follow anyway he has some
great content
but scott barry kaufman tells the story
of
uh
he goes
he says he likes to do uh edibles so
here's his tweet that starts it off he
goes i love edibles meaning marijuana
edibles but the edibles i do are usually
only about five to ten milligrams of thc
content
i accidentally purchased a snickerdoodle
with abnormally high thc content
i didn't realize until a second after i
ate most of it that the single cookie
was at 100 milligrams
it was 10 to 20 times the power
of what he normally experienced
now here's the fun part i won't read you
the whole thread because it's worth
looking at so he had he decides
before he starts you know losing his uh
let's say powers of judgment
he realizes that in a few minutes he's
just going to be tripping balls i mean
he's just going to be he's just going to
be
in an interesting situation
so being a cognitive scientist uh which
is what makes this whole thing
interesting
is he decided to sort of play it out
and i guess at some point he decided to
document his experience
so he decides to take an uber to the
emergency room
so that whatever is about to happen to
him he can ride it out with you know
professionals around in case something
goes
and i guess they took his pulse and
they're like holy crap
now that's a pulse and uh
so as
as i expected with my complete lack of
medical training he wasn't in
it didn't look like he was actually
gonna die he was just gonna have a real
interesting mental experience now he
describes it as
hallucinating basically like a trip
now
you might be aware i don't know if any
of you are aware of this but i've had
experience
with this
with this drug
yes i have
and i've never had an experience of
anything that i would describe as
hallucinating
has anybody else ever had that no i
don't know if it's the way i do it or
you know maybe i'm just too acclimated
to it or something but i've never had
anything even close to that
but i will accept that if you took 10
times your normal amount
in the form of an edible in particular
that maybe you could have something like
that so anyway the the net of it is that
this cognitive scientist
got a real look behind the curtain
do you know what i mean
if you're a cognitive scientist and
you've never had a hallucino
hallucination experience like a
hallucinogen
if you've never had that experience
you're working on the other side of the
curtain you know the part where
everybody can see stuff
but as soon as you take that
that
that trip
you see behind the curtain all the stuff
you couldn't see on the other side
and that's what happened to i think
scott barry kaufman but
he's got an interesting experience in
front of him i believe
now i can't read his mind so this is
just me speculating
there's no way he could go through the
experience he did
and ended up with a good story to tell
and some insights
without wanting to do a mushroom trip
you you can't come out of that not
wanting to be a little curious
what if i took it up a level and here's
what i would say to scott barry kaufman
if he's thinking about that
whatever he experienced
with this
with this overdose of the cookie
well every experience with that is not
in any way
roughly
similar to what a mushroom experience
would be it's just not
and i didn't experience what he
experienced but i can still say that
with some confidence
anybody on here would agree with me i
think if you've if you've had that
experience
but the most important part of this
question was uh
he said he ate
most of that snickerdoodle
and
i sent him a message to see if i could
get the rest of it for myself but
i know that seems seemed like a pretty
awesome cookie
i also wonder
i also wonder how much of that cookie i
could have eaten without feeling
anything
you know
i'm pretty sure i could
i could have polished off half a box
before before i noticed anything was
amiss
um anyway here's a story that i didn't
talk about when it was newer
because i didn't believe it
yeah you see stuff on twitter and you
say i'm not sure that's true that looks
a little bit too on the nose
but i think this is true
that when elon musk was challenged by
i guess the world
food program that you know that just six
billion dollars of his wealth could
solve world hunger which they later
walked back a little bit and said well
six billion would help a lot with the
infrastructure to get people fed it
wouldn't feed everybody
but
elon musk apparently took the challenge
and quietly sold
or donated six billion dollars worth of
stock
to some kind of charities that
presumably have something to do with
feeding people so we don't know the
details of where it went
but as someone else said on twitter is
that the most baller thing you've ever
heard in your life
that somebody said if you give six
billion dollars we could cure world
hunger which was hyperbole yeah nobody
believed that literally
but then he challenged that assumption
you know that that math could even make
sense
and then he gave six billion dollars
how do you beat that
i mean seriously how do you beat that
for
just publicity
i don't know
when you can make your uh real moves in
the real world also funny
then you're operating at a different
level
you you want to know who the real
operators are in this world i'm going to
give you a hint
i don't know if this will help you or
not
but when you see people do real things
that make a real difference such as
donating six billion dollars to charity
but
it's also in the context of kind of
funny
you have somebody operating on a whole
different level a whole different level
and that's sort of like a tell
for somebody who's behind the curtain
so much so that uh
looking for the humor in people's moves
can can really tell you something
all right
um
one of the more interesting stories
which is interesting because it
shouldn't be interesting
which is interesting
which is that uh elon omar
representative omar
uh tweeted this and she was talking
about the
the canadian government
no i'll actually talk about the
journalists who felt the need to i'll
just read you her to vote her tweet
quote
her quote or a tweet her quote
she said i failed to see why any
journalist felt the need to report on a
shop owner making such an insignificant
donation rather to to get them harassed
it's unconscionable and journalists need
to do better
so while it seems like much of the
political right in the united states is
in favor of the truck drivers and the
trucking uh protest in canada
uh elon omar who you would expect to be
always on the opposite side of wherever
the right was
is coming down solidly on the
side of justice
and
justice in this case in my opinion and
hers apparently too
is that
you shouldn't be doxing people for small
donations to legal activities
that that's really too far
and
you know i saw uh i think over a
thousand people had quote tweeted her
and most of them were saying something
to the effect of
well when you've lost omaro you've you
know you've gone too far or
or how unusual it is that
how unusual it is that you would be on
the side and everything and i started to
do one of those too
because that just felt like the natural
way to handle this and i thought
well maybe i shouldn't
maybe i shouldn't quote tweet that
maybe that should just live by itself
because i feel like that's a more
respectful way to treat it although i
suppose talking about it
cancels out what i'm saying
but i think that that deserved just a
tweet or retweet
because if you just agree with it
maybe that's the end of the story
maybe when somebody who
sees an injustice and calls it out maybe
you don't need to say anything about
that
maybe that is maybe that's it
somebody saw an injustice
they called it out
so we could be on the same side about
that
so we're on the same side a little bit
and it seems that
the pandemic maybe brought us closer
together
in a weird way
somebody thinks i'm high
i hate to i hate to inform you that i'm
not
uh i know surprise
so what about florida
man
i don't know if desantis leaves a
charmed life
or he's just the luckiest governor or
he's just that good
it's one of those things or maybe it's
all three i don't know
but florida set records in 2021 for
tourism
what
during the pandemic
set records for tourism now of course
some of that was helped by the fact that
it was a free state
so people didn't really have many
choices
during the pandemic if anybody talked
about traveling domestically
where did they say they were going
if they said they were moving it was
either going to be you know
texas
or florida if they said they were going
for a vacation
it was usually florida
so florida actually found a way
to make a profit
in a way you know at least tourism-wise
on the pandemic
now that is a well-managed state
that is a well-managed state
um
so i'm i'm really fascinated by the
trump versus desantis
dance that's starting to happen
because it does seem like trump probably
has the weight that he could get the
nomination again if he wants to
but at the same time
i don't know that would get trump
everything he wants
you know in terms of politics
desantis might give trump more stuff
than trump could get for himself
there would be trump-like stuff
meaning that you know the same
philosophy of thought
so
that puts a little pressure on trump
doesn't it
because if you're trump if you genuinely
want the things that you say you want
what happens if you're not the best
deliverer of those things
and just because of the the provocation
that trump brings with everything i
think he's i think he's surfaced all the
issues
in a way that only trump can
in other words i wouldn't assume the
stage one
in which i think trump was actually
ideally suited
i think i think trump was ideally suited
for his first term
because he needed to
show us that the news was fake he did
he needed to show us what was important
china
he did
so i think that in terms of priorities
and you know even border security and
stuff like that
i think that trump showed us what works
and then weirdly
biden showed us what doesn't
right
but the only thing that biden did bring
and i'm gonna give him credit for this
is that even though he's he's made some
you know i think bad mistakes in terms
of demonizing the unvaccinated
i think he generally has
kept the provocation low
that was one of the things he promised
to keep the division low and i think the
division that's being sowed is mostly
you know baseline stuff it doesn't seem
like he's the one who's creating it
whereas trump was really the one causing
the trouble if you know what i mean but
but i think that trump caused productive
trouble
that this is where i depart from a lot
of people
i think the trouble that trump caused
was mostly productive because it was the
conversations we needed to have
but now now that everything's surfaced
and you know trump
trump did i think
and
i probably will always believe this
i think trump's first term
is one of the greatest presidencies and
will always be looked that way you once
i think once historians get some
objectivity over time
i think it'll look like one of the great
presidencies
and i when he first ran i said he should
be a first a one-term president
does anybody remember me saying that
that when he first ran i said you know
this might make a good first term
situation
one term president because
if you mix things up enough it's just
hard to get elected that second time
in order for trump to be as effective as
he was to bring us as much
really truth in a weird way ironically i
mean trump is the one who told us how
corrupt everything is
in a way that makes us believe it
because now we can see it with our own
eyes
so it seems to me that he was uniquely
perfect for the time
he needed to take out the bush dynasty
he needed to take out the clinton
dynasty i'm not sure if they're
completely taken out
but they they were things that only he
could do
could you imagine if you reverse the
order
and desantis had been president first
and then you know trump tried to be
president later that wouldn't work
nearly as well would it
you needed trump to go in there and just
shake the box like crazy
break everything let us see what's in
there
you know let us fight about it let us
scream about it let's cry about it a
little bit
but then when we're done
when we're done screaming at each other
and crying
then you've got to fix it right because
shaking the box is just
you know that's just the demolition
stage
so
maybe maybe desantis is an architect
and maybe trump was a wrecking ball and
maybe you needed them in exactly the
order you got them
that's what it looks like to me
i think i think that we might
be blessed
maybe
with the wrecking ball followed by a top
architect
can't get better than that
like if you're in a hole well let me not
mix my metaphors here but if you're in a
if you're in a bad place
what you want is wrecking ball first
master architect second
we might be in line to get that
which would be really interesting really
interesting
um go exempt and do not file you don't
need to block traffic to protest
oh
okay
i'm not sure i understand that comment
um
but in order for the wrecking ball slash
master architect model to work that
would require require
trump to back that concept
and i think that trump could not back
another person for president until
and if
the truth social network launches and
looks like it's going to work
i think if the truth network works
you know
trump's own social network if that looks
like it's going to work
i think that gives him the freedom
to be a
desantis enabler
and still claim credit for
anything good that happens during
a different administration
and
i think that would be a strongest play
i think that would be a strongest play
and by the way it's the one i'd want to
see
because if i can be honest i think i can
can i
i could be honest with you can i i act
like that would be a surprise
yes i can be honest with you i don't
want a president of that age
i love trump
like personally
you know i got to meet him personally i
love the guy
like he could not have been more
generous and kind in person so when you
have a good personal experience with
somebody
it's really hard to get get past that
into any other kind of consideration
so
i'm i'm 100 bias in favor of him
i think his first term was
historic
and i think that
um
you know more of trump would be better
than less
i i like what he brings even though he
brings trouble with it right but i like
what he brings
i think he could bring it better
outside of politics
at this point
before i think he was better inside of
politics i think he was exactly the
right person at the right time
but at this point i think the system
could benefit
from a george washington kind of an
approach
and by the way that's what it is
you know george washington in a way
as narratives go
essentially created this country
not by winning the
the revolution or the war
but some say he created the country by
stepping away from power
when he was so popular he could have
turned it into a dictatorship if he
wanted to
but he didn't he stepped away
trump is oddly in a similar situation
because the polls are going to show he
could win the nomination
and i think the polls are going to show
he could win the presidency
and he's going to have to look at his
own age
and he's going to have to look at his
own ego
the the challenge of his life if you
think about it
the the greatest challenge of trump's
life ever
would no
nothing i don't think anything would be
second place
the greatest challenge of his life
would be to be have a commanding lead in
a in a hypothetical match up
and then walk away
that would be one of the greatest things
a president ever did
because
washington did it
now the the purpose would be different
he wouldn't be walking away from a
dictatorship
but he would be walking away from a
certain amount of power
uh revenge uh payback
um winning
like all the things that his ego want
all the things that he would want as a
human you know entity those are all the
things you want
but
i don't know
this will be a great test
i
i don't know
if trump could rise to it
i don't know because it's asking a lot
really it's asking somebody
to
effectively override their most basic
operation system operating system that's
driven them their entire life
but could he do it
i think he could
i think it would be the hardest thing he
ever did
but i think he could do it we'll
see um
do you think putin's going to invade
it's looking more and more like this is
a
psychological operation isn't it
it looks more and more
yeah it looks more and more like uh this
is always just a scaram so the reasons
that we have to think that it was not a
serious invasion you've got the
ukrainians saying that they don't have
an invasion force it's not the kind of
force you need for an invasion
full-scale invasion
you've got the chinese embassy that
never even stopped its normal operations
in kiev
what does china know that we don't know
they didn't even stop their normal
operations you know when war was
supposed to happen that day
so they must know something
and then uh the funniest part was
apparently uh
russia
who was it their uh
what entity was it you know the story
probably
um was it there uh
uh you know there's some kind of foreign
entity
they they announced that they'd like the
united states to tell them uh when
they're when russia plans to attack
ukraine so they can plan their vacations
around it
and apparently an official russian
entity actually issued that
like actually said hey can you tell us
all the dates that we're going to
attack ukraine so we can plan our
diplomatic vacations around that
now do you think that russia now
obviously putin must have approved that
right uh or or they knew that he would
approve it so it was compatible with
putin we assume
do you think that putin would tease
about
uh invading if he planned to actually
invade
it doesn't really make sense does it
it's possible i mean it could be you
know the clever
cleverness squared where he just kids
like he's not and that's really to to
get your
guard down or something like that
but it really does sound to my
to my ear it sounds like a country that
doesn't plan to
it doesn't plan to invade
now
could i be wrong about that of course of
course
but
things are very much
you know suggesting that
they're not planning yet or he hasn't
decided to invade let's put it that way
here's what i think is happening i think
that russia is trying to make
ukraine and nato and everybody think
he's going to invade
would you agree so far
that he's not trying to trick you
like into thinking he's not invading
he's doing the opposite
it seems like he's he's giving you all
the indications he plans to invade
while telling you he's not going to
invade
he wants you to think he's going to
invade right why would you do that
and why would you why would you stay in
that situation so long
well one of it is negotiation right
apparently there's still still some
negotiating going on
but the other part that i think is
equally important is
the closer you are to actual kinetic war
the more you're going to see
what the other side's defenses look like
am i right
now
if anybody has military experience
please override my opinion because i
don't
but it seems to be the most obvious
logical thing you do
is if you know that they're going to see
the invasion coming anyway
it's not really going to be a secret
invasion
you want to keep them on edge as long as
possible
because you should be able to
figure out where all the defensive
strategies are
because they would be more active
so for example
if if they had a a type of missile
system defense
you should see them
getting a little more active around it
and that would tell you where it is
you might see assets being moved into
place
and it's easier to spot something when
it's on the move
so i would expect that part of this is
putin just finding out
how hard would it be
to invade this country because he
probably doesn't know
how many of you have military experience
would agree with the following statement
putin doesn't know what he's in for if
he invades he doesn't know because i
don't think it could be known
right you know
is it
the famous quote by mike tyson
that when it comes to a boxing match
everybody has a plan until they get
punched in the face
and then that's the end of your plan
so here i asked the question about what
kind of uh
what kind of defensive systems might
ukraine have now i would take as a given
that we that the public doesn't know
what weapons they have
is that fair to say
i feel like it should be fair to say but
maybe not do we publicize every time
somebody buys a weapon system
i don't know
because you do see publicity about
weapon systems all the time
as in
you know this country you bought this
defensive weapon system whatever but you
would think that the good stuff they
wouldn't talk about right
i assume now i asked this question is
there any kind of uh
well how long would a russian tank
last if it got on ukraine soil
and here's the the sort of the bigger
answer and then the smaller answer the
bigger answer is as i understand it
a squadron of tanks
would have in modern warfare they would
have all kinds of air support
and ground support
and if you tried to get near them with a
missile or a tank or an airplane
there would be a defensive umbrella
around the tank squadron
so far does that sound right
so in modern warfare have we ever seen
that deployed
i don't think so
i don't think we've ever seen a tank war
between modern powers
using the technology that would be
available today right
so nobody's ever seen it nobody knows
what would happen
my guess is that a big
identifiable metal object
such as a troop carrier or a a tank
would disappear in the first 10 minutes
of a modern battle
like 10 minutes
that that's that's my non-military mind
without the benefit of any experience
whatsoever because it's too easy to find
them
i would think that in modern warfare the
only thing that matters is you can find
them am i right
that identifying where something is is
all it takes
because you have the weapons to destroy
anything
they can't stop you from destroying
something you can identify
am i right
if you can see it you can kill it
with today's weapons
so i
one of the weapons that i
assumed existed
and i just got a confirmation this
morning from several people tweeting at
me have you ever heard of missiles
called atacms
and
variations therein so it would be one
missile that would be aimed at say a
squadron of tanks or a big military
industrial complex
and the missile would come down and
before it lands
it would start spinning
really fast
and while it's spinning then it would
start giving off smaller projectiles
and the smaller projectiles would just
be like rain you know they would just
fill the air
with basically deadly projectiles so
that by the time the the missile and the
projectiles hit the ground
it it basically just
rips through
metal you know walls concrete it's just
going to rip through everything because
the kinetic energy is so high
so
you could take out an entire squad of
tanks
with one missile
now
could the russians shoot down that one
missile
probably they have some kind of air
you know defense
but how many of them could they get
if we shot five of them
i mean do the ukrainians have five of
them
if they shot five of them could russia
get all five
before they landed because only one
needs to land before it takes out their
whole
their whole business there
um scott why do you accept the globalist
premise that putin initiated the ukraine
invasion hoax
um do i do that
i didn't know i was doing that
so
i guess if i'm if i thought i was doing
that i
i am under the understanding
that
the ukraine the history and russia is
all complicated and it's not as it's not
as simple as
you know putin putin wants to attack
i get that right so i'm not buying into
the
simplest the simplest explanation but
here's my take i think that uh i think
that putin can't take the risk
of invading ukraine and losing
am i right
the risk of invading ukraine and finding
out that the russian army can't get
10 miles into ukraine
would be catastrophic
so i feel like he can't take the risk
on paper it looks like oh yeah he can
make short work of ukraine because you
know he's just got all this good
military stuff
but i'll bet you that that never works
in the real world i bet you in the real
world there's some weapons that they
don't know are coming at them and they
would just bog them down and they would
look like the weakest army and and so
they would end up being
economically destroyed
without getting ukraine
and while also having their entire
military credibility destroyed and i'm
not even sure putin could
could survive that kind of enough people
he's pretty popular in russia
but i don't know if he can survive it
we'll see
wall street journal was talking about
how hard it is to spy on putin because
it's hard to get a like a human being
who's willing to do it because i imagine
i imagine getting caught spying on putin
is a bad day
so they can't get people to do it
uh wall street journal had a bunch of
interesting articles today
and one of them was how china suppressed
coven better
do you know what the
biggest trick
for suppressing covet in china was
rapid
testing they had
apparently they had so many tests that
they could do
an entire city
in five hours
they could test everyone in the city
let me say that again
they had enough tests that they could
test everybody in the city in five hours
everybody in the city
what
um
so and also when they were doing their
lockdowns apparently they would do it by
like neighborhood they wouldn't
necessarily close down the whole city
and so far it looks like it's working
although it did see some pictures from
hong kong that said they're they're
getting a surge
so we do think the surge is going to
happen i don't know that china could
keep it off forever but they were
actually effective and i think the
testing was the biggest part of it now
when you think about that
what would the united states have looked
like if we had had enough tests
and and why didn't we
corruption
i'm almost certain of it now i don't
have proof
but i
i am so sure that if you looked into why
we didn't have tests
and others did
i think you'd find corruption because i
don't know any anything else that would
explain it really even incompetence
couldn't get you there
rasmussen also had a poll in which they
asked about the
whether the clinton 2016 campaign
scandal is uh
bigger than watergate
is it worse than the watergate now how
much do you love the fact that rasmussen
actually asked this poll question
is the clinton you know allegedly
hiring lawyers who
allegedly spied on trump's um
communications traffic
so
how much do you love that they even
asked the question but two-thirds of the
american public agreed
that what we're seeing in the news today
that the clinton campaign did is
by two-thirds of the public
worse than
watergate worse than the watergate
two-thirds of the public
here's a good question did tru this is
to me did trump order you to amass an
audience of midwit defense-sitting
boomers and persuade them to the right
i appreciate your fifty dollars
thank you thank you for that comment if
you'd like to make more comments of that
nature
for fifty dollars a piece
i welcome the criticism
all right
and so i think the funniest thing about
this uh
clinton campaign being worse than
watergate
is that carl bernstein the official cnn
worse than watergate guy
the guy who they would bring on to say
that whatever trump was doing that week
was worse than watergate
i believe that carl bernstein bernstein
is now hidden so deeply in a cave that
even jesus himself couldn't find himself
out in three days
so
that's how hidden carl bernstein is
we we should do a gofundme to see if
anybody can find him
just just see if i can find him like at
you know just a starbucks or something
just to see if you can find him i'll bet
he is so missing right now
all right
over at cnn speaking of cnn
insider this is of course a fox news
report they like to fox news just loves
dumping on cnn
and vice versa
and according to an insider now chris
cuomo is a despised figure within cnn
can you imagine what the conversation is
like as cnn
what the hell would that be like like
the actual private conversations
among the producers and the on-air
talent
it's got to be kind of hilarious isn't
it like in a weird way
are you dismissing the high probability
that china is lying
i'm not dismissing the high possibility
that china is lying but the rest of the
world would know if they had a massive
you know covent problem
it would be too hard to lie about it
so
anyway cnn's a festering cesspool of
hatred they all hate each other but
here's the question that i have after
all this
okay now that we know for sure
that the clinton campaign was behind
all of the russia collusion hoax stuff
okay so now that's just a matter of fact
how many of the on-air people at cnn
knew it was all along
and reported it anyway
and how many of them thought it was true
because here's the thing if they thought
it was true
they're all stupid
am i right is that fair to say
if you thought that was all true from
the start
you're kind of not that smart
honestly
like it would be one thing to say well
wait and see
i mean that would be fair
but if you believed it
if you believed it from the start
you're not very smart and that's not a
good look
but it could be worse yeah
van jones said
uh in when he was asked that he thought
it was a nothing burger but i don't
think he ever varied from that did he
i think that van jones was always
consistent
uh i don't think he made a prediction
that it was not a nothing burger at any
point so i think he was always right
about that
so the question is
how many people that cnn knew they were
lying
or misleading
and how many of them were just stupid
because neither of those is a good look
but it was one of those
it was either stupid or lying there's no
second choice or third choice right
and why aren't we even asking that
question
wouldn't you like to see don lemon ask
the question
did you know you were lying
or wrong
and what would they say would they say
oh yeah you know
we did our best but we thought it was
true
is that what they say
or would they change the subject to
something else that
trump did that they're accusing him of
a trump supporter bought cnn i don't
know that that's true but it might be
i don't know if he's a trump supporter
um
so there's a terrific thread on how the
fake news
works that you should read but
first i wanted to call out this
odd thing
can you think of any industry besides
cnn and msnbc in the news think of any
industry
where you could deliver to customers the
opposite of what they think they're
paying for
or why they go there
and it works out
and they still make money
because cnn's job is to give you the
news
and instead they gave you fake news
that's the opposite of the news it's
literally the opposite of the product
you think you're getting
is there any other industry that can
give you literally the opposite of what
you thought you were buying and stay in
business
i was thinking what if you went to your
doctor
and a doctor diagnoses you and said all
right
take these pills
and so you say the doctor
will these pills cure me
and the doctor says
no no these pills will kill you
well that would be the opposite of why
you went to the doctor
would you still pay the doctor well i
guess you'd have to pay in advance
but it's really remarkable that the
industry can stay alive and vital the
news industry
by delivering exactly the opposite of
what they promise you
and you know it
that's the funny thing is you know it
if you didn't know they were giving you
the opposite of what you bought well
that makes sense why you would keep
consuming it
but they give you the opposite and you
consume it anyway
and there was a great
thread on that about why journalists end
up
printing and it's because the
system requires it basically
so the system requires that they work
faster
than they know it would take to get good
sources
so the system requires them to work too
fast to do a good job
and then the system rewards them for
having provocative content because those
are the ones that get clicks
so the system guarantees that anybody
who intends to be honest will eventually
be turned
think about that
the system as it exists the system of
gathering and making money from news
dissemination
it guarantees fake news
it guarantees it
and now it doesn't mean to every story
every time
but over time it guarantees that that
the news business will only be populated
with people who are comfortable lying
and lying makes more money
am i wrong
the the economic incentive
to be an honest person in the news
business is disappearing the economic
incentive to be a gigantic liar
and be in the news business is
increasing
it just pays really well and it's not
illegal apparently
maybe you should be
all right
that to me is really
interesting
because we have a system that guarantees
we get the wrong answers and it's a
system that we depend on
is one of our most vital systems
is the news
and we've designed the system that's
vital
it's actually designed in a way to
guarantee it gives us the opposite of
what we need
think about that
is guaranteed
is built into the system
the system can only do what the system
does right
capitalism doesn't make you lazy
it makes you have to work to get some
money
right
um that's not a golden age element yes
but i do believe
i'm being asked to apologize for my
trump comment
which one should i apologize for
or are you even talking to me what did i
say about trump
that's anything but a compliment
um
yes so as uh
the imitation chen
on uh
on
youtube is saying that the independent
uh voices are becoming
you know more credible and more
important i think that's true
but we still don't have any near you
know
even joe rogan is not really trying to
be political
he just ended up that way
bring duvall back on
i need a better technology for guests
um you're discounting news from
msm no i'm not discounting that news i'm
just talking about the platforms
all right
do you have any other questions because
that is about what i wanted to talk
about today
uh am i going to post on trump's new
platform
um well it's not open yet right
i don't think the platform's open yet
scott are you richer than joe rogan i
doubt it
um
but the answer is i'm sure i'll test it
out yes
uh any truth social predictions
well you know as you know there have
been a number of uh alternative
platforms
designed to
allow free speech but they run into the
same problem that if you're doing you
know dangerous free speech
that has to be banned everywhere
um and then you end up with just with
one voice on your platform which is no
fun
but trump the trump platform might
attract enough people on the left
just to dunk on him
that it could end up working
so
as soon as you throw trump into the mix
all the all the rules change because
he's
he authors the simulation he doesn't
respond to it
so who knows
but i would say that nothing's had a
better chance
nothing's had a better chance than
something with trump's name on it
all right
um
and any other uh
questions
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
