[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and wow
are you happy to be here it's going to
be amazing and if You' like your
experience today to go up to levels that
nobody can understand with their tiny SM
smooth human brains I can't
multitask all you need is coer marar a
glass a tanker cheler Stein a Ken Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure
dope mean head of the day the thing
makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now
go oh that's good that's some good stuff
right there I hope it was as good for
you all right we still got a little bit
of
a problem here with
my come on
chat I can make this work you know my
secret with technology is something
doesn't work you close it and reopen it
and you reboot then you reload the app
none of that ever works by the way but
it's what I do you should do it
too all right I'm definitely going to
make this
work there it
is we have
success well you're probably asking me
Scott what does the Dilbert comic look
like today is it relevant is it funny
well I'm going to show you
how would you like to see
it so here's the dilber comic for today
you normally you could only see this if
you are subscribing but I thought you'd
like a preview uh the pointy a boss says
our CEO is showing signs of dementia it
will be your job to cover it up he says
to Dilbert and Dilbert says why and the
boss says if we get a new CEO he might
hire one of his friends to take my job
and dilbur says how bad is his dementia
and the boss says it's like a mild
cold that's called
foreshadowing
foreshadowing and if
you if
you oh my oh
my all right so let's make that go
away hey look at me using all this
technology
successfully incredible well there's a
new study that says that one of the
things you you can do for Parkinson's
you know CU Biden is suspected of having
Parkinson's and they found that uh if
you do these three things at the same
time you can reduce your
Parkinson uh Risk by
55% you got to drink coffee smoke
tobacco and take
aspirin well you know what I'm not going
to recommend all of those things I'm not
sure you should start smoking to reduce
your risk of Parkinson's and it does
bring into question who funded that
study who do you think funded the study
that said smoking tobacco could get rid
of your Parkinson
risk could it be tobacco people I don't
know so I of course immediately uh
searched the internet to find out if
marijuana had been tested as a possible
treatment
for uh or preventive for Parkinson's and
the answer is the studies are ambiguous
but there is some evidence marijuana is
helpful for reducing at least the
symptoms of Parkinson's or if I could
summarize this in all one big
summary science doesn't know what
works maybe about anything I don't know
but uh no I would not start smoking
cigarettes and take an aspirin to reduce
your
Parkinson's well there's a big bust in
Oregon so Oregon uh had a big crime wave
and apparently 4,000 Lego St sets were
stolen and they were valued at over
$200,000 in Lego sets now it took the
police a three-month
investigation do you know why I took him
three months to solve the Lego
situation it's because it took him a
while to piece it all
together ah you're welcome you're
welcome
well there's a lawsuit against
Northwestern the school for anti-white
anti-male hiring so it's another Dei
story so do you need to know the details
no there's a
professor he's white he's male can't get
a job I didn't even read it but I can
tell you that's the story yep if these
lawsuits succeed do you think you'll see
more of them yes you will one of the
things about uh you know following the
money is it's like seeing the future
let's see if somebody succeeds in a
lawsuit will there be more of them yes
there will the likelihood of succeeding
in this lawsuit probably
100% because the thing with these Dei
cases is you never have to look for the
evidence the evidence is what they told
you and what they wrote down and the
Witnesses all over the place and 100% of
the people would agree and everybody in
the same situation had the same
outcome it's the easiest case you can
ever prove because nobody's hiding it
not not only are they not hiding it it's
often written down as a policy so how do
you lose
that yeah imagine if there were entities
that wrote wrote policy documents that
says uh we're going to steal money from
people when they're not looking and
we're just going to keep it
and you'd say to yourself I think I
could find the conviction
here all
right Tony
Robbins has uh reportedly according to
Wall Street Journal bet $200 million of
his own money on a new
technology uh that allegedly can turn
coal into hydrogen so it can burn clean
so some kind of sciency
process to make coal which would be sort
of a dirty fuel into hydrogen which
would be super
clean now how does Tony Robbins have
$200
million I I had to check on his net
worth and of course net worth numbers
are usually ridiculous made up but it
says his net worth was 600
million and he put 200 million into one
bet that's a hell of a
bet and uh this entrepreneur has some
your
credentials but some scientists are
skeptical well I'm going to join these
skeptical scientists but I do love how
Tony Robbins is putting his own money
into
it let's call this another example of
people who have given up on the
government why would Tony Robbins put
$200 million of his own money into this
is it because he's a good investor I
doubt it I mean I don't this would be
weird to put a a third of your net
wealth into one company that hasn't
proven its technology that would not
normally be the definition of a good
investor so why would he do
it well I've got a few opinions you know
one is I think when you're really
successful you end up with a God
complex speaking from experience you end
up with a God complex and you wonder
well what else can I do
if I did all this what else can I do
like I don't know what my limit is and I
ran into that problem when when Dilbert
became
successful there was this period of my
life maybe five years where everything I
touched was successful I make a book
it's a bestseller I make a comic it's a
big hit yeah it was just everything I uh
go into speaking circuit I'm one of the
highest paid speakers so for a while I
thought to myself I wonder what my limit
is like should I be shooting higher
should I be building a rocket to Mars
and you could see that Elon Musk
probably has the same thing he builds a
car company that nobody could build and
then he probably has to wonder well
maybe I could have done more than that
like what's bigger than that how about
putting human life on
Mars kind of a God complex doing things
that don't seem like they're possible so
some of it is actually just a um I think
people testing their own
limits but some of it the bigger
story is I think we've given up on the
government there was a time when I
thought well the big problems have to be
solved by the government you know a war
has to be solved by the government a
pandemic government you know fixing
climate change well that's probably
going to be a government thing it's so
big but nobody really trusts the
government to fix
anything so if you really think that you
know climate change is a problem and
you're Tony Robbins and you know that
you've done things that didn't even look
possible you probably say to yourself
you know what maybe it's up to me with
great power comes great responsibility
and I think that's what's behind that
actually so good luck with that Thomas
Massie Finally checked in you know as
his wife tragically died a few weeks ago
and
he uh you know he's he's struggling of
course uh the family is struggling they
would be but apparently an autopsy has
been conducted you know she had full
security she died at home and they don't
know what the cause of death is so they
don't have the results of the autopsy
yet God that would be
maddening imagine it's been two weeks
and you don't know the cause of death it
was natural well I mean there there were
no signs it was anything but a natural
death but they don't know the cause and
know she was not
vaccinated I know you can
ask well Trump continues to be the best
writer in the business uh I'm going to
read one of his lengthy truth social
Post in which he talks about Nancy
Pelosi only for entertainment all right
this has no news value whatsoever it's
not news you can use I just want to show
you his writing skill now if you think
he doesn't have writing skill just feel
how much you feel his writing oh my God
you can feel it all right I'll just read
it quote crazy Nancy Pelosi is more of a
cognitive mess than sleepy crooked Joe I
mean come on that's just so
good there's just so much color in that
first sentence I mean you just feel
every part every word you're going to
feel he goes on
she also suffers from a terminal case of
TDS Trump derangement syndrome uh she is
a total nut job who impeached me twice
and lost lost meaning he stayed in the
job now I see her going around barely
now I see her going around barely
meaning that she can barely go around
and saying that I am a threat to
democracy no this is just radical left
Democrat disinformation which is all
they're good at uh Trump continued uh
trying to convince anyone that will
listen that crooked Joe is a mental
Giant and in great form which everyone
knows he is
not she she's just continuing the lie to
the American
people
uh uh and that uh she is the true threat
to democracy and a very sick one and
remember she took full responsibility
for not doing her job on January 6th it
was her fault and I'd like to thank her
daughter for supplying the tape of ny's
confession but what took so long hiding
evidence is a
crime I just see him standing you know
on a platform above the ocean that
that's filled with sharks and he's just
he's just got this big barrel of meat
and he's like I have a little more red
meat and he throws it in the Sharks go
crazy and he goes how about over
here and he's just throwing red meat
into the Sharks and the Sharks the shark
sharks think they have free will and
they're just
like and he's just orchestrating all
their craziness so he he he does this
thing where he throws in so many
accusations you don't even know what to
do about
it anyway so
funny well I was asked today for some
constructive
optimism and I'm going to give you some
optimism because some of the stories
coming up are you know less optimistic
but uh this is from General Mike
Flynn and somebody posted about you know
how bad things are and uh he wanted to
give us some optimism he said the
country is absolutely fixable we cannot
take nor accept a Deus attitude I
understand fully how corrupt our
bureaucracy and elements within our
government have begun the one person who
can fix it is the president but it must
be the right president how do you think
Lincoln felt halfway through his
administration with the unity of the
nation in grave Peril or other great
leaders throughout history who saw Peril
and did not flinch and a fear or
indecision hang tough Wyatt that's who
he was talking to in his comments uh I
know you will million as will millions
of others you only lose when you quit
that is
correct that is correct now one I've
told told you this before one of the
great advantages of being my age is that
I get to see how many times we've been
doomed we've been doomed a lot we've
been doomed since I was 5 years old we
were doomed from a definite you know
nuclear war with Russia the ozone was
emptying the we're running out of oil
and the hippies were going to take over
and ruin our work culture and it looked
like the Communists were going to you
know Domino up with the world and we're
polluted and we wouldn't be able to
breathe going to run out of
food that's just when I was 10 that
that's all the problems we had when I
was 10 years
old and 70s actually turned out to be
pretty good ERA you after the after the
war um so I would say that uh
America is really really good at solving
problems but the phase before we solve a
problem always looks like this it looks
like us complaining and not knowing how
to solve the problem and when
everybody's complaining enough and
everybody feels doomed enough and the
problems look big enough then we solve
them because the weird thing about our
problems is they're not
unsolvable if we you know work together
to solve them
but if you don't work together you're
pretty much
dead I think I could say that with
certainty if if we work together to
solve our problems very solvable very
solvable if we decide to fight each
other and not work together toward our
problems we're dead but here's the good
news America does pull together when
they don't have any choice the the
internal division is a luxury that you
get when things are working well you
don't you don't turn on each other until
things are kind of working okay and then
you have that luxury so as things get
worse our ability to solve them gets
better because that's when people say
okay as they are
now okay Biden does have a problem now
we're all on the same page because they
got worse if Biden had not gotten worse
we would still be disagreeing whether
he's bad enough to be president but you
know what we do about it um May Vary but
certainly we've agreed that now we have
the same problem we're working toward
right so I think that as the problems
get
worse our ability to solve them gets
better but that's kind of invisible
because you don't see it and and also
there's always stuff working beond the
scenes there's technology there's
inventions there people trying things
all the time we generally configure this
stuff stuff out I would rate our current
problems as
average average if you looked at every
problem in America and compared to to
all the problems we've ever had
somewhere in the middle it's not it's
not an extra scary time might be the
opposite it's probably closer to extra
safe than it is to extra scary on
average so no don't worry about
everything falling apart it might get
worse but as it does it gets closer to
the time we have the resolve to solve
it all right there's going to be what
they call a big boy press conference
today Biden's going to try to take
questions from the White House Press
Corp at 5:30
Eastern um so that would be uh right in
the middle of uh Fox News is the
five um so it's going to ruin their
show and um I might want to live stream
when that's happening I haven't decided
yet but I'll see what I'm doing here's
what I think is the
plan uh since it's clear that Biden
himself does not want to leave it seems
clear that Jill is on that same
page and they don't have the physical
power to force him out but they really
really they meaning Democrats the
leadership really really need him to
leave what are you going to do well now
we know let me tell you what they're
going to do
and it's embarrassing and
it's it's just
icky they can't talk him into leaving
and they can't leave him there what are
they going to
do they can't leave him can't leaveing
it the way it is and they can't talk him
into leaving what does that leave him
murder now I'm not predicting that
because it'd be too obvious so I think
murder is off the
table so you can't kill
him can't get him to leave on his
own can't force him out what's
left you can figure this one out
yourself I'm going to give you one more
clue okay that Kirby said in front of
the public that this pressor would be
quote a big boy press conference a big
boy press do you see it
yet and then uh George Clooney says um
yeah he's he's gone and now we hear that
Obama agreed with Clooney that you know
he had no objection Clooney s the do you
see it
yet he's going to embarrass him out of
office do you think that they would have
this press conference if they were
trying to protect him nope because we
know that he doesn't have to give a
press conference he went a years barely
doing any of it if they wanted to
protect them they wouldn't do it the
Democrats have decided very clearly I
would say it's obvious at this point
that they're they're trying to embarrass
him out of office by making him perform
and making him fail in front of you so
you're watching the Democrats slowly
torture their own beloved
candidate because they need to win more
than they need
anything and there's nothing they won't
do to get it if they could kill them I
think they would I think the only thing
that stops them is they would get caught
I don't think anything else would stop
him from killing him honestly so if you
want to know how loyal the Democrats are
to their own people and to their
constituency look at
this seems seems pretty definitive to
me um I would argue also as somebody
else pointed out that maybe the reason
that Biden is hanging tough is that they
won't have an
income imagine trying to take care of
Biden on no
income that's sort of where they're
heading no source of in come and having
to take care of a dementia patient with
security needs and you know all kinds of
special needs they need the money so
here's what I think uh Hunter is doing I
think Hunter is brought in for the one
thing that
Jill probably isn't good at
negotiating I think Hunter is a
negotiator I think Hunter is trying to
work on a deal where the family will
make a
fortune and then he'll talk his father
into
leaving I will guarantee you somehow
Hunter is going to come out ahead of
this because he's got all the leverage
Hunter is the most powerful person in
the country right now because if he says
that offer is good enough I will talk to
my father it's going to happen if Hunter
goes to his father and says look you're
probably going to end up dropping out
anyway your your health is failing but
if you were to leave now you could
retain some dignity and I can get $200
million out of them because they're
going to give me a piece of some action
it's not written down but I've got a
commitment you know they're going to
make something happen for us that
wouldn't have happened otherwise so for
the legacy of the family the good of the
family and your own you know Health Care
um I'm going to take the $200 million
all you have to do is bow out gracefully
that's what they're waiting for I
guarantee it will it happen probably not
probably not I I think that I'm still
going to bet that Biden stays into
election day and that the Democrats
start saying well but you know you're
really voting for kamla we we didn't
have time to do all the paperwork and
get on the ballots with a different name
and you know we were just pressed for
time and you know so you're just really
voting for
kamla that's my prediction
all right um if there's anybody new here
who's never been in my live stream you
probably couldn't you probably couldn't
conceive of how smart the audience is
normally you probably have no idea how
smart this audience is I'm going to give
you a demonstration of how smart the
audience is give me the answer before I
ask the
question go give me the answer before
you know what the topic is go correct
answer
yep there's a whole stream of correct
answers that's how smart they are the
correct answer is
25% I haven't even asked the
question here's the question according
to a rasmuson poll what percent of
Voters are very confident that Biden is
physically and mentally up to the job of
being president of the United
States it's actually 26% but I feel like
raspon got it wrong by one I feel like I
trust you more
so I'm going to say We'll round it to
25% you know because rasmon is very
accurate but let's be honest they're not
nearly as accurate as you are guessing
the answer before I ask the question
because you get that every time
so this is called
science well PJ media is writing about
this whole uh KL Harris conundrum and uh
referred to a made a Dilbert reference
in
this
um let's see what do they call it uh
sort of a Dilbert like
uh track and the oh here let me read the
exact
quote history will likely show that the
smartest decision Joe Biden ever made
was selecting Comm Harris's VP it's not
a PR trick but a dilber era middle
management trick if you don't want to be
replaced make sure you're subar
subordinates suck more than you do now
that's literally been a Dilbert comic
joke it's a recurring one in fact I've
got one coming up that has that that
theme as well so yes uh I've often told
you that what I call the Dilbert filter
which is how do big organizations work
in the real world that's the Dilbert
filter in the real world they pursue
Dei in the real world leaders do in fact
make sure that their subordinates are
not as good as them that's a real thing
I mean literally a real thing and when
they do those two
things and then they find out that the
leader has to leave they are trapped by
their own Dei situation so it's it's
exactly a dilbur situation and it's one
that's been in the comic and will be
again so now they're boxed in there's
nothing they can do that's why I think
it's Kamala or bust and there's no real
reason to elevator to the top of the
ticket makes more sense just to leave it
the way it is and let people vote the
way it is all
right I saw Senator
Kennedy um do the most useful thing I've
seen a senator do in a long time uh
probably because Thomas massie's you
know and a congress Congress is not
terribly
functional um but at least Senator
Kennedy is here's what he did he brought
in some budget expert for the government
and asked uh how much would we need to
cut the budget to balance it now that's
not paying down the deficit that's not
paying down the 35 trillion it's just
what would it take to not make it more
how much would you have to cut how many
of you know the answer to that how much
would you have to cut the current budget
to get it in Balance because if you said
well one or two% then I'd say oh we
don't have that big a problem
right um so the expert said
78% do you think there's any human way
that our current government could cut
our budget by 7 or
8% no no because you'd have to cut
everything and if you didn't cut
everything it gets worse because if you
said oh we we're not going to cut this
one section we're not going to cut this
one
well then you're talking about maybe 15%
cuts to other places do you think we
could cut any part of the whole budget
15% with the current government in the
current situation no not not a chance
because cutting gets you
unelected pushing the can down the the
field gets you elected because they know
they always get
elected so I asked chat GPT to give me a
little uh sanity check on it and here's
just some numbers just to hold in your
head when you're talking about the
budget just a few numbers to keep in
your head so you feel like you're smart
first of all our budget every year is
around $6
trillion so that's the US budget but we
don't take in that much in taxes so um
about 1.2 trillion of it is
borrowing so that what would if you just
round off what is 1 trillion of 6
trillion about
17% right so no cutting seven or 8%
isn't going to get you
close you have to cut more than
177% of
everything do you think there's any
chance we would cut 177% off the budget
of
everything and again if we don't that
means that some budget is going to get
it twice as
hard or the other budgets would be twice
as hard and not twice you know I'm
exaggerating
but that's what it would look
like and then I asked myself how is that
even possible so then I asked chat GPT
to come up with its own budget to tell
me what to cut in each of the current
budget categories to get to uh to get to
a balanced
budget and I'll tell you what Chad gbt
says just to give you an idea how oh
maybe I
won't have to look it
up um but the answer is way more
horrifying you would have to make Cuts
in various things about
25% so probably somewhere in the
neighborhood of 17 to 25% you'd have to
take off of every budget do you think
they're going to cut the military by 17
to
25% do you think Social Security is
going to get cut by no no there isn't
any
way so if there's no way to do
it are we
doomed and it was really hard to get um
even chat GPT to give me a suggested
budget which we could
survive survival I'm not I'm not even
talking about op optimizing I'm not
talking about the best of several plans
I tried to get Chad gbt to give me any
estimate where we could
survive and it fought
me just like humans do that that's why
Kennedy did a service he actually nailed
somebody down and forced him to give
them a number because nobody wants to do
it the reason nobody wants to do it is
the number is
unsurvivable nobody wants to say
honestly it's unsurvivable
there's no way to cut it and there's no
way to survive
it that's the truth it's
unsurvivable now does that mean we're
doomed no let's go back to General
um um I'm sorry just general uh you know
you know the
thing Flynn General
FP so we go back to his optimism is this
a worse problem than the Civil War no is
a worse problem than World War 1 or two
no is it a worse problem than the
pandemic maybe but it's within the realm
of things we
solve how I have no idea but let me give
you some just brainstorming to give you
a sense it might be possible all right
because we need you need to feel it
might be
possible number one
um Elon Musk says that Tesla might be
you know way more valuable because of
all the robots we're going to go through
a one sever
robot um cycle where we will sell
probably I don't know make and sell a
hundred million robots pretty
soon what if we tax the
robots and just stop taxing
people so if you were to get a robot you
got
pay something per
robot because nobody already has a robot
like a personal robot so if you just
said all right here's the cost of a
robot it's going to be 25,000 and there
will always be a 10% robot
tax well if you never had to pay a robot
tax because you never bought a robot it
doesn't look so bad does it it just
looks like it's the cost of the
robot and you'd say well I have a
maintenance program that's on I have
insurance for my robot that's
ongoing what if I have a little tax
that's ongoing too just part of the cost
of owning now who's going to be buying
these robots not poor people so it
wouldn't be a tax on poor people it
would be very much on rich people and
most of the most of the robots will
probably be by big companies who buy all
of the robots and then they rent them to
you so it'll be robot as a service so
you're not going to have necessarily a
robot in your house but you might have a
robot that drives up to your house and
it's self-driving Tesla cleans your
house and then goes back to its business
while you're at work that might happen
probably will happen so everybody's
going to be renting a robot even if they
don't own one so could you get to a
point where the robot tax is paying all
of your uh your costs how about AI
AI is going to be wildly profitable for
some companies and wildly
gigantic suppose you say uh I put a
special tax on I don't know um uh data
centers because we know we're going to
build build like trillions of dollars of
data centers so suppose you say 10% tax
or something and suddenly you're talking
about things that are so big and so knew
that there's some
chance that growth gets rid of some of
your deficit some chance but you would
also have to almost stop
spending you you'd have to just like
flatten spending for a long time the
other thing you could do is use AI to
recommend where the cuts are the reason
you could use AI is that Congress will
only vote for things for which they
won't be blamed
later right right if you say who's in
favor of cutting these budgets
20% no Congress person signs up for that
because that's the end of your job
because you would be blamed for cutting
10% or 20% of their social security
they're going to take it personally so
how could you make it so that Congress
could vote in the way that's the best
for the country and not lose their jobs
I have a suggestion you delegate the
suggestion for the cuts to
AI now will AI make the best decisions
nobody will ever agree on that no we'd
fight it we'd say no don't listen to
that AI but what AI would do it would
give the Congress people an
out if they could sell the AI version of
the cuts to the
public then they can say look if it were
up to me if it were up to me I wouldn't
have done that but we had decided on a
process in which AI would make the
decisions because we all agree that if
the humans try to make the decisions
we'll just delay
it so can we all agree this is what you
can imagine Congress saying can we all
agree that if you leave it to us we
won't do it we'll just Kick the Can
forever you agree it has to be
done let's agree that we'll use this
objective standard that doesn't care
about us one way or the other AI let AI
make the decision a word to cut and AI
might be more
rational for example if you and I were
going to cut we might say oh I think
they can handle 2% but I can't go
further but the AI might say oh you
realize if you just redo this whole
department you can lower the expenses
90% because that's something humans
wouldn't necessarily see but maybe the
AI would say oh we could just automate
this whole thing I can I can get rid of
the entire I don't know Department of
whatever just make it AI it'll take you
two
years 90% reduction in cost so the AI
could do things that the humans can't do
only because the AI won't be blamed for
being biased I mean it will be biased
but it won't won't be as Blain so is
there any path yes I don't know what it
will be but I think we have a chance now
here's an update I was talking about the
idea of using a magic crypto to pay off
our debt
and I kept asking for people to validate
whether that was the dumbest idea in the
world because it sounds like it or the
smartest idea in the world because
sometimes the smartest idea and the dumb
dumbest idea sound the same it's really
hard to tell sometimes so I did get uh
some expert smart people who contacted
me separately and explained to me nope
you can't do it so here's some here's
the the simple explanation is if you add
money to the system in any way whether
it's regular money or crypto it's too
much money in the system it's inflation
everything
crashes now that I
knew um of
course
um but I was thinking what if you just
replaced US dollars with crypto does
that create money out of nothing and
here's the other problem apparently even
if a space alien came down and gave you
somehow Ally gave you money to pay off
all $35 trillion national debt it would
destroy the
country didn't see that coming did you
if if some outside third party who
magically had $35
trillion appear tomorrow and says I'll
tell you what I could write a
check we'll just get rid of all this
debt it would be so disruptive that the
economy wouldn't
recover so you need some kind of debt
because the debt is doing work too right
debt isn't zero money debt
is somebody gave the government money
and then the government can allow Banks
to lend more money and then the economy
works that's the quick expression but
here's my updated
suggestion
suppose you created a
crypto but it could never compete with
money how is that possible you say well
like this suppose the government said
we're going to make a program for people
who don't have a lot of
money that they can uh buy all these
goods and services that are you know
super designed so that they're cheap and
effective and healthy uh but you can
only spend crypto on
it now that doesn't work because the
crypto would still have to get into the
system if you were only spending the
crypto for the
government well here's the idea it's a
bad idea
but could you bifurcate the
economy so that it introduces new money
but that new money can't can't get to
the rest of the economy to cause
inflation in other words could you
create fake money just for poor people
so the poor people could have goods and
services but it wouldn't add money to
the system because they'd be set off
they couldn't buy a car with it they
could only buy food and shelter and
stuff I don't know I think that doesn't
work either
pretty much all the ideas don't work but
here's the thing I want to tell
you paying them the debt doesn't seem
that
important um but getting rid of the
deficit is critical to
survival does that make sense you you
got to make sure that your budget every
year is good because if you drive the 35
trillion up to 100 trillion we are
definitely all
dead so there's something is too big for
sure but it's not too big yet it's
getting there but if the only thing you
did is keep it the
same you could limp along and inflate it
away over over the years so
the you either have to massively
increase taxes by massively increasing
productivity uh or else you cut things
massively but your your choices are some
kind of massive growth and some kind of
massive Cuts now if you cut the
difference it would be something like
you'd have to take the GDP from what is
around three or
four you'd probably have to get it up to
six or seven which probably can only
happen during the robot AI turnover it
could work the other way and reduce it
but I think in the short term it would
be more um and then maybe cut things
10% and you have to have ai make the
cutting decisions because the Congress
can't so that's what you're looking
at hey have you heard the uh the
Democrats say that Trump is only in it
for himself he's only in it for
himself this is called the projection
alert projection alert where they accuse
somebody of what they're doing what do
you think uh they think of Biden right
now so Biden is staying in the race
for Biden right there's nobody there's
nobody who's a democrat or a republican
nobody who believes that he's staying in
the race because it's good for the
country not a single person believes
that what have they been saying about
Trump he's in it for
himself how's that work because it's so
good for the Trump
brand that's not
true how how is he in it for himself
exactly unless you think he's going to
steal your D democr Dem
democracy I don't I can't even call it
democracy it's like a dumb crazy have
you noticed how much democracy and dumb
crazy sound the same it's our democracy
crazy
democracy anyway so I think even the
Democrats are starting to write wait a
minute something's going on here it
would seem to me that Biden's only in it
for himself it would seem to me that
Trump is like Jesus and he is
sacrificing his brand his maybe his life
and uh his reputation and his business
to help the country
survive now maybe he's doing it for his
ego but don't they all do it for their
ego I mean that's always part of it
right you think you think Biden doesn't
have an ego
everybody's in there for the
ego but uh there was an
MSNBC guest who repeated what I call the
Gutfeld observation they didn't credit
him of course because it's MSNBC but
they basically were saying out
loud uh why do
we why do we keep pretending that Trump
is an existential threat at the same
time we're running the only person who
will surely lose to him in El
how do we explain to
ourselves our own messaging that Trump
is a threat to the existence of the
world and we're not trying very hard to
replace them in fact we're doing the
worst thing we could possibly do if
that's what we cared about how do we
explain
that well apparently there's some
evidence from people who are Democrats
who are finally
admitting that they are not worried
about a trump presidency at all
that's right you wonder are the
Democrats lying crazy or
evil turns out that more and more of
them are admitting they were just lying
they do not in fact fear an existential
threat from a trump
presidency do you know how I knew
that here let me let me show you how I
knew that I'll prove it to you right now
I hope otherwise this will be very
embarrassing um
you prove it by looking at the stock
market and uh let's see what's the stock
market look like uh we'll just take you
since let's take the stock market since
uh we learned for sure that it was going
to be Biden versus Trump and then we
learned for sure that Biden had a very
low chance of winning and it was going
to be Trump so scary Trump was going to
end the world what does that do to the
S&P
500 right up so the stock market which
is a collection of all the smart
people no worry whatsoever because that
that's pricing Trump into the market
because the market is a forward-looking
uh measurement so when the market is
confident and solid it means that they
are not worrying about Trump ruining
things it means they were
lying now here's the fun
part since we know that Biden was
obviously demented and has been for a
long time and we know that most of the
media on the left was saying H we don't
see anything no problem yep don't see a
problem
here it's one of those rare times when
both Democrats and Republicans can tell
that they were saying things that
weren't true that the people in charge
of the truth the news and and the
politicians now we both know it right
everybody knows it
so that's where it gets
fun because if everybody knows they were
telling us what wasn't
true what are
the what are the the Press who was
saying it and covering up for it how did
they explain themselves well the only
two
possibilities are that they were Li
or they were
stupid if you're a member of the press
and your only choices are to explain
your behavior by saying I was either
stupid and didn't notice the Dementia or
I was
lying and I wasn't dumb I was just lying
I was a weasel which one will they
pick it's an easy question if you're in
the press and you admit that you
lied there's no penalty
when it was the last time you saw
somebody lying about the news and losing
their job there's no penalty for that
but suppose you said I didn't
notice then you just look like the
dumbest person in all of
politics really you're the only person
who didn't notice that how do you not
notice that so you have this situation
where uh you can see it already it's
starting the Press is
scrambling to confess
that they
lied because the alternative is that
they were really really stupid and
that's less survivable than lying
because they work in an industry where
lying is so ordinary it's not a risk
think about that being stupid in public
is always a
risk but lying in public as long as it's
clear that they all did it totally
survivable so the weird thing is you're
going to see people rushing to confess
that they were lying because the
alternative would be
worse I love this summer I love this
summer yeah there might be some
cognitive distance but I think they
actually know exactly what happened and
why all right
um let's see who's stealing who
democracy this would be another uh
projection alert projection alert
well uh Jen weager says in a post it's
not helping the Democrats case for
democracy when Joe Biden's campaign is
premised on the idea that it doesn't
matter if he is seile in office then who
are we voting for and how is that
[Laughter]
democracy so here's another prominent
Democrat voice saying wait a minute the
things we're saying and the things we're
doing they don't line up at all they
don't line
up all right so let's go down the list
of Democrats stealing democracy and then
we'll do Trump we'll do Trump stealing
democracy uh this is going to be a
little bit of a
spoiler but you probably didn't see this
coming but the list of things that would
be Democrats stealing democracy are all
real and
observable the list of trump stealing
democracy
is
imaginary are you surprised that that's
their play every everything
that everything that they do in front of
us is objectively true and observable
everything they they say about Trump is
like really like in the future he'll
turn into a dragon and use his fiery
breath to destroy your village I'm not
so sure that's going to happen feels
imaginary so here's the list uh the
Democrats rigged their own
primaries and still
are uh they created a massive assault on
Free Speech if you don't know how that
worked follow Mike Ben by creating you
know infinite um external entities that
could put pressure on us sources of
information so that would be the Twitter
files and everything else so massive
Free Speech assault trying to limit the
Second Amendment of course uh
weaponizing the Department of Justice
against Trump all the
lawfare nobody believes that that's
legitimate you know if if you're still
in the world where well but Democrats
think they're just pursuing the law no
they're not no they're not that they're
not not anything like that it's
transparent obvious weaponization of the
Department of Justice it's obviously
coordinated it's exactly what you see
um they have controlled the
media so that uh everybody started
saying that that Biden was sharp as
attack at the same time and their media
was like well okay whatever so we can
see that they control the media although
the media finally gave up on them on the
Biden brain thing only because they had
to only because they had to where if the
debate hadn't happened the media would
still be covering up for Biden
just think about that they'd still be
covering except for the debate if if the
public had not found out on their own
basically doing their own research by
watching the debate the news never would
have told
you is that that's just mind-blowing
that we had to see it ourselves they
never would have told
us now we got Democrats to discuss
packing the Supreme Court because they
don't like it impeaching AOC wants to
impeach two of the justices because they
don't like it so they're not so big on
the whole separation of powers thing um
there's the whole starting a war under
false pretense in Ukraine what part of
that was
democracy did we vote for a war I don't
recall voting for a war no I don't
remember that at all but we're in one um
the Democrats have universally and
completely and in every case voted
against laws that would improve election
Integrity they have voted against every
measure that would make it more clear
who got elected that's not a coincidence
it's because they're stealing your
democracy there's only one explanation
for that uh now you got the party Elites
trying to replace Biden which is
basically the Iranian system where the
elites or the mullus decide who can run
because it doesn't matter which one gets
elected because they've all been
pre-approved the Iranian system and
they're doing it right in front of us
again it's observable right you can see
them trying to organize a fake primary
after they had
one
um and uh now we are connecting the dots
that uh Hunter once took a $5 million
loan from a Chinese um citizen who was
connected to Chinese intelligence and
there's no indication he ever paid back
the 5 million loan which would mean that
somebody in China kind of owns them a
little bit and uh now Hunters maybe
controlling policy in the White House
just because he's
capable so that's the how's that does
that sound like
democracy the guy who is the gatekeeper
for the president owes a Chinese guy
connected to security or Intel 5
million I don't think that could be
worse all right so those seem I think
you'd agree that those are
observable not really any question that
all that's happening not really now
here's uh here's Trump's list stealing
your
democracy there's the things on the
project 2025 list that he does not agree
with so the first imaginary category are
things he says he doesn't agree with and
wouldn't
do so that's one of the r that he's
going to steal your democracy the things
he says he won't do because they are
trying to paint him as supporter of
things he's not
supporting uh then there's uh all the
gaslighting that Democrats did about
January
6 so because January 6 was a whole op a
gaslighting op in which they pretended
it was an Insurrection and that Trump
wasn't in charge of it an entire
imaginary hoax that's one of the the
main reasons that they have to say well
if he did it once he'll do it again but
he didn't do it once he left office on
the day he was supposed to leave
office and there was never any
possibility he could have taken over a
country because some of his supporters
trespassed or because uh he picked some
alternate electors just to hold his
rights but that didn't work
out all right um and then
uh there's the stuff that Democrats are
hallucinating Trump might do if he
becomes
president literally they're afraid of
the things you'll do that they don't
really have a specific name for but
think you won't leave office and just
crazy that is not observable and it
seems to come out of pure mental illness
we just lying and uh then of course
there's the abortion question that he'll
take away your bodily autonomy will he
do that by taking himself out of the
decision-making process because that's
what he said he'd do he said he would
not be part of any national ban on
abortion in other words he's not going
to be a decision
maker either way he said he wants he
moved all the power to the states which
they've been wanting to do so that it's
not his
role how how does how does giving your
power away to the states suddenly
qualify as stealing your
democracy I mean basically all he did is
correct it it's something that was you
know seemed out a whack at one point so
he corrected it put the power back in
the States where it probably should have
always been now have I made my
case that the Trump stealing your
democracy is purely imaginary it's based
on their own hoaxes and gaslighting and
uh all of theirs are obvious it's a long
longer list and you can observe it it's
observable right now you don't have to
wonder what will happen in the future
it's right
now all right and then you have of
course Biden defying the majority
because ABC news says two-thirds of the
public wants him to step down is he
acting all
Democratic by staying in
office when we don't know who's in
charge and two-thirds of the country
wants him to step down including
majority of his own party so that that's
his view of
preserving democracy I guess not doing
what people want now I know we're not a
democracy
we're uh let let me just do an update
for the
NPCs swimming is the best form of
exercise the United States is a form of
Republic not a
democracy and if somebody invents a new
source of
food it's probably soil and
green so if you're trying to remain uh
an NPC in good standing make sure that
whenever any of those topics come up you
you add your value like I just
did all right uh representative Anna
Pina
Luna uh from Florida she wants uh she's
leading up an effort to try to find uh
attorney general Garland 10,000 per day
until he turns over the her audio now
the her audio is the one where we think
President Biden was in coherent uh but
the transcript may have erased all the
incoherence so since they already have
the transcript what would be the big
deal of hearing the actual audio well I
think we all suspect that the only
reason you don't hear it is that is
really
bad and I think her was maybe being kind
by saying he's too out of it to ever
stand
trial I think he was right on that and
so far he's been Vindicated
but I would ask you this representative
Luna how's this good for
us how how's it
good because worst case scenario is that
audio comes out tomorrow Democrats say
oh okay we're all out and it goes to 90%
Democrats want him
out and then basically has no choice
he's going to get pushed down so how's
that good for
Trump I think Trump Trump is playing
this right Trump's playing it right
because the question of whether Biden is
mentally capable has been asked and
answered if you're still trying to ask
and answer it you're only introducing a
variable that we don't need and could go
wrong because the way it could go wrong
is it might give the Democrats the
ability to rapidly replace them and then
you don't know what you're getting then
you don't know what you're getting could
be
better although they still the problem
of how do you skip over kamla so I
suppose the way they would do it is they
would Elevate kamla Harris to the top
they would pick a really strong vice
president and then it would sell him as
a team they'd say well you know if you
don't like kamla it's a team look at
this vice president pick it's so
strong that's probably their best play
but I don't think we need to hear the
her tape it's not going to add anything
but it could subtract something it could
reduce the chances you get the president
you want
uh joyy bear says that when Trump calls
kamla laughing laughing kamla that is
sexist that's not something you would
never make fun of a man's laugh would
you like yeah of course this is purely
sexist because making fun of how
somebody
laughs
honestly that only happens to women and
conservatives only make fun of women who
laugh wrong
have I ever given you my Tucker Carlson
laughing
impression I can't do the high pitch
everybody makes fun of Tucker's
laugh Tucker's laugh is one of the most
famous
memes in all of right leaning
world we love
Tucker no joy bayar has she could find
more ways to be wrong about more things
than anybody I've ever seen in my life
it's literally one of the most famous
things that people make fun of is that
Tucker has one of the most distinctive
laughs and all of
LOM so no it's not it's not uh
sexist anyway so the press conference
will be 5:30 today eastern
time um and basically all the major
Outlets news outlets that normally
support the president or against him in
other news Alex Soros the heir to the
Soros Fortune now in control of its
money has married Huma
abedine I'm just going to say it that do
you want me to beat around the bush or
do you want me to just say
it this is why it's good to be cancelled
I would never say what I'm going to say
next unless I'd been
cancelled if you spend one minute go
Googling Alex
Soros and
images he's very
gay all right let's just say you've
never seen a gayer guy hanging out in
Intimate poses with his
boyfriends he's not even slightly
straight he's the gayest gay guy you've
ever seen in your life now if you don't
believe me just Google his images
there are plenty of them it's it's
really observable and obvious now you
will not tell me here's what won't
happen I guarantee this won't happen
you're not going to go look at the
pictures yourself and then say well I
think you're misinterpreting this
Scott no you're not going to do
that there's no doubt from his personal
life that he's a gay man now I love I
love the lgbtq community I'm very PR gay
so I'm not saying anything bad about him
you know just just to clarify you know
it's 2024 you have to clarify in 2024 I
shouldn't have to
clarify that if I mention somebody's gay
it's not an insult can we just are we
past that yet can we be past that can it
just be a fact without without it being
some kind of you know assumed insult we
should be way past that uh cu the LGBT
community is probably one of the most
successful American communities uh one
of one of the ones I have the most
respect for honestly because you know
why nobody ever said
this we don't want to go to that gay
neighborhood because of all the crime
and
filth it's like one of the most
successful groups in America so I have
complete respect for that group now he's
obviously a member of the
group and he's marrying a woman
who's what 10 years older than
him which is what billionaires do all
the time don't they they marry people
who are 10 years older than
them I don't think I've ever seen it
frankly it's like that's like how
something happens zero times so your
pattern Rec recognition should be
kicking in at this point and your
pattern recognition should say something
like huh that looks a lot like somebody
who's getting married for political
reasons doesn't it what could that
political reason be well we believe that
George Soros whether you think he's evil
or not is a brilliant brilliant
tactician would you agree nobody's ever
called George Soros dumb I mean he just
keeps doing smart looking things that
you might not
like but he's certainly
effective would you say the same thing
about
Alex well I don't know I I've not seen
any evidence that he's a highly
qualified player it seems that they're
hiding him from
interviews because given his aized
influence on the world I mean really
really big he should be on interviews
every
day but they seem to be hiding him if
you can find an interview of him talking
in public you'll very quickly learn why
they're hiding him I don't think he's
good at it I don't think he's good at it
and I think think that when you see
Hillary Clinton's best friend and
Confidant marry him in a marriage that
looks suspicious at best you have to say
to yourself is there something else
going on
here now I don't
know but let me just
speculate it looks like Hillary is
making a play to control the Soros
Fortune after George Soros passes which
will happen pretty
soon because all that money or at least
control of it will go to Alex Alex will
be controlled by
Huma which gives Hillary functional
control of the Soros of
Fortune that's the play in my opinion
that's the play now let's take it to the
next level of conspiracy theory
what happens if Alex Soros dies in a
boating accident
tragically what if he falls off a
yacht and the Shark E him because that
could happen he's on a lot of Yachts
accidents happen people accidents happen
just the fact that he happens to be in
Killer's uh I mean Hillary's he's in
Hillary's orbit that doesn't mean
something bad's going to happen to him I
mean I know you think that but just
because killary I mean Hillary just
because Hillary would get functional
control of I don't know $30 billion
dollar that she could use to control the
world that doesn't mean she's going to
kill Alex and let haa take over the
money and presumably Clinton has some
influence over
Uma
so I think it's exactly what it looks
like I think Huma is going to um maybe
make George Soros happy before he dies
as in maybe Jor Soros doesn't know his
son is
gay and he might think you know what I
really need is heirs I want to make sure
I have an
heir so it could
be that Alex is making his father seem
to be getting an air but he'll die
before he has to see if there's an air
or
not so every bit of this looks
suspicious they they don't look like a
couple even a little bit honestly if you
see the
pictures I think it's exactly what it
looks like it looks like a Hillary
Clinton play to get control of soros's
Fortune because they don't think Alex
Soros is Dependable or smart
and they need to control it because it's
essential to their power base they can't
lose control of
that that's what I
think
um and uh let's see
uh um I'm quoted in the Gateway
pundit so uh here's what I said that
they quoted I said this on X when Biden
refuses to sign a bill preventing
non-citizens from voting which I think
is going to happen so the house passed a
bill that says non-citizens can't vote
um the Senate might pass it we don't
know but if they did it would get to
Biden and he said he would reject it so
here that's the premise so if Biden
refuses to sign a bill preventing nine
citizens from
voting uh that should become the only
issue in the
campaign because it also reveals
everything else it's like the key that
opens up everything uh it gives away the
whole
game and what I mean by that is it's an
unambiguous statement that Democrats
prefer their power over your happiness
there's no other way to explain it that
they they need a crooked election
because they need the power and they
don't care if it makes you unhappy and
your round comes worse they're just
putting themselves over you and what I
said is she you should ask Democrats to
defend it and you should ask Biden to
defend it like why would you say that
non-citizens could vote now I think
their reason is going to be
um somebody's telling me that Uma is 47
so she's not going to be making any
errors I
disagree she that they could make a they
could probably use a surrogate and make
a
baby so don't be surprised if you hear
that there's a surrogate baby on the
way
um
anyway so I would ask uh Biden to defend
it and I would ask the Democrats to
defend why they don't want to limit
voting to
Citizens and uh I don't think they can
defend it I think that what they're
going to say is well it's already
illegal so don't worry about it but
that's kind of missing the point well
The Daily Show had a little panel of six
black voters that they were asking about
uh the
presidency and uh so they got
they're New Yorkers too so they're black
New York voters a mix of men and women
and uh half of the group three and a six
said they would vote for
Trump the uh the moderator who worked
for the The Daily Show was also a black
gentleman and after three of the six of
them said they' vote for Trump uh he
said and I quote we're an even split I
didn't see that
coming I didn't see that coming
I did I would I would have guessed three
out of
six if you said how many randomly picked
are going to say Trump I would have said
about three ns6 that's you know two
ns6 maybe more often but three NS six I
think you could get
there and as Mike Ben warns and many of
you are seeing and I think Glenn
Greenwald is warning on this too uh the
Democrats can't release on this Russia
is to blame for everything thing do you
all understand why it's always
Russia yeah you have to know the history
of the
CIA so the CIA is the CIA because of the
Soviet Union when the Soviet Union fell
they needed a new enemy to justify their
actions and their budget so like well
Russia even though the entire point of
disintegrating the Soviet Union was that
Russia would basically becomes friends
with the United
States do you know why we're not friends
with Russia when everything they were
doing was for the intention of being our
friends and never being at war with
us it's because it wouldn't be good for
the cia's budget that's probably the
only reason yeah that's probably the
only reason now there was also the O the
energy stuff you know later blah blah
blah and Putin you know maybe
interfering in other countries where we
wanted to interfere before he interfered
so there's you certainly there's lots of
little
stuff but if we had already made friends
with them Putin probably would already
be working productively with us in these
other countries and if he wanted
something like a warm a warm
port and they were our
allies we would have said something like
why would we object to you having a warm
Port you're our
Ally we we don't object to France
putting a port anywhere do we they're
Ally so it seems to me that the reason
Russia Russia Russia is because the
Intel people work with the
Democrats and the Intel people need the
Democrats to tell you that Russia Russ
Russia so they can keep their budget so
I don't think that the the Russia is an
enemy is real I don't think it's based
on reality uh I think some reality comes
out of it because when you tell each
other you're enemies you don't work
together in other countries well so we
see that but it feels like a
manufactured problem
totally manufactured and it looks like
it's manufactured to support the budget
of her intelligence people and nothing
else it may be military
too that's what it looks
like
um Eric Adams says Sanctuary cities are
a big mistake wants them to go away of
course all right I've got a challenge
for you oh wait we'll do this first so
Joe Rogan was talking about uh Elon Musk
believing we live in a
simulation and he said something that
I've said a few few times he said if
you're Elon Musk of course you believe
it's a simulation people are letting you
drill tunnels under LA and shoot rockets
off into space and you make electric
cars solar roof panels I mean he's
literally living like some character in
a
movie now I've told you that right the
exact same thing if you were Elon Musk
and you saw what you could personally
accomplish you would have to believe
none of this is real because he lives
life like a like a video game he plays
video games so that model is in his head
you know closer to the front of his
head but I say the same thing now you
don't know everything about my life but
if if you just looked at the things you
know about how's that possibly real that
when I was six years old I said you know
I think I want to be a famous
cartoonist well the number of famous
cartoonists who happened since I was six
years old is like
three three or four and of s billion
people and I I'm one of the three or
four how's that
possible and then you know next thing I
know I'm predicting Trump and I'm
invited to the White House and here I am
how is any of this possible right and
that's just my professional life my
personal life is even weirder how is any
of it
possible so yes I believe we're in a
simulation and I think we're going to
find out in a year so that's my
prediction I think we're one one year
away from confirming that we live in a
simulation now when I say confirming I
don't mean that everybody will
agree I mean that the evidence will be
overwhelming and here's what it will
look like in one year we will create our
own simulation in which the characters
believe they have Consciousness Free
Will and they living their own lives
once we do that and we already have the
tech for that once we do it maybe in a
year the argument for us not being one
will just disappear because once we can
do it the argument was always that once
it can be done there'll be more than one
so after after somebody makes one of
them in a year in the real world in one
year there will be that simulation
somebody else is going to say hey that's
a good idea I'll make one too and at
that moment the number of simulated
realities will be confirmed to be twice
as me many as base reality if there is
if even one
exists now the argument that I've heard
against the simulation is stupid and it
goes like this P Scott you're just
pushing God back one more level I mean
you know something can't come from
nothing so therefore a God and then I
say is God something well yeah
where did he come
from
um something came from nothing or
something was always
there here's the answer to where
everything came
from everything was always
here that's it now the fact that your
brain Can't Wrap its head around that
doesn't make it wrong because you can't
wrap your head around any of physics but
you're not you don't need to solve the
problem of how anything came from
nothing because that's an absurd
assumption the correct assumption is
there was always something do you know
why because you can't make something out
of nothing it's obvious there was always
something you know even if you say the
the big bang was the
beginning no whatever it was that caused
the Big Bang had to exist so there was
always something even if it was packed
into you know one little singularity but
there was something so no you don't have
to solve the god or simulation problem
there was always something that's it
that's the whole solution there was
always
something all
right here is my last challenge to you I
want to see if you can prove me wrong um
I was curious how many of the
predictions made during the U um alore
era of the Inconvenient Truth when he
first started saying you were all doomed
from climate change how many predictions
were made either by him or other experts
at that time that have panned
out now that seems like the easiest
thing you could look up in the world
doesn't it the most important thing is
climate change so there's you know a
gazillion documents and science about
climate change the most important thing
we need to know about climate change is
are the predictions
correct right would you agree it's the
biggest problem if it's
true and the biggest issue within it is
can we predict it so that we know that
we're we're in
trouble so the most obvious thing that
should be easy to Google would be what
are the predictions and what's the
reality you can't find
it you cannot find
it good luck you can even take one thing
take just one thing thing are the storms
more severe or
less good luck you'll you'll find yes
you'll find no sometimes you'll find
confusing answers but you cannot answer
the question have the have the
predictions so far turned out to be true
now here's what you're going to say but
Scott I know the answer the the sea
level has not
risen that's not what the internet says
the internet says that the sea level has
has risen but not
everywhere for example in the Gulf of
Mexico they say the sea level has risen
as
predicted but maybe not on the other
side of
Florida so if you go to the internet I
swear to God this is true they'll tell
you that the sea level rose on the west
side of Florida but not the east
side which maybe is possible because the
one side is warmer than the other
but don't you think it rais a little bit
on the other
side yeah so here's my challenge to you
my challenge is this you cannot with any
credibility determine if the predictions
were right or wrong now do you think
that's an accident that the Internet
won't tell you that do you think that
nobody studied that no I'll bet it just
is gets erased as it's
published I guarantee you that somebody
did a good job of looking at the
predictions and a really good job of
comparing them to reality and you can't
 find
it
try see try yourself I I I welcome the
challenge see if you can find the answer
to that question now the fact that you
can't find it what does that tell you
that's all you need to
know that is the dog that is so not
barking because if the predictions had
been largely
true not completely but even just
largely
true uh you would hear that every day
right if alore had been right about most
things but not everything it's all you
would hear it'd be in the news every day
look how right we were
I don't see it I see stuff like uh looks
like this one Island had a little
problem but the island next to it was
fine
or it we did get storms like a little
earlier this year but we don't really
see a signal that there's more or Worse
storms but some people would say there
are that that's the state of our
data don't know so we don't know if sea
levels going up or down we don't know if
storms are getting worse and then what
about the
ice there there there were there was a
prediction that the uh the ice would
melt and that the you know the North
Pole you'd be able to pass so is that a
a prediction from climate
change well the trouble is that was
predicted without climate change because
the the world is always warming or
cooling long term
so we already
knew that the ice was going to melt CU
we're in a warming
period which is better than being in a
CO cooling period so how much of the ice
melt is because it was going to happen
anyway
versus climate change well the the
argument would be but Scott there's an
acceleration so it it's it's much more
now it's accelerated yeah yeah there
might be some Baseline because we're at
a long-term warming period but you know
accelerated did it did it you think they
can measure that because I've seen
evidence that they measured it wrong do
I believe the evidence that they
measured it wrong no do I do I believe
the evidence that they measured it right
no because part of the argument is
you're measuring the wrong ice like
there are places where there's less of
it but in other places there's a lot
more and if you only looked at one place
you'd say well there's less less ice
there but if you looked at all the
places you'd find that some were more
and some were
less did you know that I'm not even sure
if it's true it's just something I
read so we can't even we can't even be
sure that
conclusively that we have more or less
ice I mean just think about that and
then what about the polar
bears the polar bears of course would be
um at risk if the ice melted but you
know what happened we came up with some
polar bear
conservation laws and polar bearers are
starting to come back what about the
uh what about the uh Great Barrier
Reef that there was going to be
bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef and
then when the uh you know the the coral
all dies that would cause some ripple
effect and you know the oceans would be
in bad shape
did that happen yeah it happened for
years the the Great Barrier Reef was
getting worse and worse and worse and
worse until about three years ago and
then It
reversed why why did it
reverse how could
it and the answer is well maybe we don't
know much about Great Barrier
reefs so we don't have conclusive
evidence that anything has ever happened
in climate
for 30 years probably no real evidence
there are claims but nothing
credible and that so it comes down to
temperature so they bring it down to but
we did tell you that as CO2 went up
which it did that temperature would go
up and sure enough temperature's up CO2
is up B Bing proved it to which I
say did it because the recent studies
show that you can't tell if the
temperature went up because the heat
Islands got closer to the thermometers
and you don't know how much that would
have affected it but you know it
affected
it right and do you think they could
have ever measured it anyway that's not
a thing humans can do we can't measure
the temperature of the earth that that
sort of the dilbur filter if you've
never worked in a big entity where you
tried to gather
data you wouldn't know that it never
works this is something I can't even
communicate you have to live it
sometimes you say to yourself well Scott
lots of times the data is good no it
isn't no it isn't no the data is never
good in the real
world the data is never good that's just
the quality of the world it doesn't not
apply to climate science climate science
isn't the first place that data became
good no it's just like everything else
it's a bunch of human beings and if they
can't measure it they lie that's what I
did used to be my job if I couldn't
measure something it was my job
explicitly I'm not making this up to lie
about it because we couldn't do things
without data and we had to show our
analysis because you needed to get
approved for things and the only way you
could do it is lying so I just changed
the assumptions and tweak things until
my boss was happy and then that was the
truth no there is no possibility that a
bunch of humans could measure the
temperature of the Earth with precision
and take it back 100 years that's
crazy yeah that's really
crazy so that concludes my prepared
comments for today thanks for joining I
know I went long again don't mean to go
long but it's just so much fun I just
want to keep doing it uh i g to say bye
to everybody um on YouTube and Rumble
and x and I'm going to talk to my
beloved people in locals only if this
works let's see if it works
today
