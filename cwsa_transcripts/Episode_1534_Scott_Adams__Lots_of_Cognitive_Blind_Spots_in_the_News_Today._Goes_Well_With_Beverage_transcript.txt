whoa
look at that youtube didn't have a good
picture but now that's fixed
it's showtime
now some people are saying i'm upside
down but i think that's on the locals
platform
but i think you move your machine around
and you can fix that
yeah other people are saying it's right
side up so i don't know what the deal is
maybe uh maybe get out and refresh or
something
try doing that
hey
ev33 what's that mean
somebody's telling me something about
ev33
i don't know
well anyway
welcome to the best thing that's ever
happened in the history of things that
happened it's called
coffee with scott adams and you don't
even have to have coffee
to enjoy it in a way that
i know a few things have ever been
enjoyed
i feel as if your pleasure capacity is
being stretched a bit that's right
you started with a
whatever your existing
capacity for pleasure was
and i stretched the heck out of that
thing and now you can have a lot more
pleasure you'll notice it a little bit
later
but if you'd like to take it up a notch
all you need is a copper mug or glass up
tanker gels a steiner canteen jugger
flask vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
being hit of the day the thing that
makes
watch this
everything better just everything it's
called the simultaneous sip and you're
going to enjoy it right now
well i'm seeing some indications in the
comments that there might be a story i
missed
something about uh ballot
auditing
is there a headline that just popped up
about
bella auditing or something
oh wait what is that feeling oh oh my
god
yeah antibodies
surging
surging antibodies
all right we will not be talking about
the quality of the audio no matter how
i'll be too
um
let's start with the fake news i always
like to tell you the fake news remember
that bow and arrow attack in norway
in which
five people
were allegedly
slain by a bow and arrow
attacker
and what did i say
what did i say about that story when i
first heard it
hmm
that's some really fine arrow shooting
right there
i feel like it's hard to kill somebody
with an arrow
am i wrong
because i feel like you could put an
arrow right through somebody
and with our modern medical
stuff
most of them would probably live
but when i heard that he had slain you
know cleanly slain five people with
arrows
did that sound like it was real
from the start from the very start did
you say to yourself there's something
wrong with this story
do you know what was wrong with the
story
he used a knife
not bow and arrow
small difference
small difference so apparently you just
knifed people to death which you know
once you start
i guess it's easier to finish the job
but it never made sense the arrows could
kill five people before people could you
know figure out what was going on
that never really made sense to me
so it turns out the news has said no he
did have a bow and arrow and he did fire
a few but those were not the things that
killed people he took down his knife
because
surprise it's really hard to kill people
with a bow and arrow
turns out that the attacker
um
it turns out that the attacker
found out exactly the first thing i
thought which is
gosh it seems like it'd be really hard
to kill multiple people with a bow and
arrow
sure enough
sure enough it was hard so he didn't do
it
weirdest story of the day but also
predictable if you're a hypnotist
apparently a number of teens and i think
more girls and boys
are getting tick-like behavior
meaning that they'll shout down a word
or they'll have you know something like
uh
um
like a tick
you know tic
and where are they getting these ticks
well let me ask you
since you know we're living in a
simulation with lots of code reuse
the answer to the question is going to
be something in code reuse
where do teens get ticks
where do they get ticks
tick tock
i'm not making that up
that's the actual story today
that professionals
are saying that
people are being influenced by um
people who watch who have tourette's
tourette's syndrome on tick tock and
they watch the various clips of
people who have actual tourettes
and have ticks
and by the way does everybody know what
a tick is
everybody knows what a tick is right
it's one of those words that if you
haven't dealt with it it's like you have
an emotion let's say a motion you can't
stop like
you know your your body is moving
involuntarily or it could be something
you shout out
i think they all count as ticks
so you got these teens who are watching
these tick tocks and getting ticks so
they got a tick tock tick
i mean what are the odds really
seriously what are the odds that tick
tock would give people texts
none of this can be real right
is there any chance this thing we call
reality is not scripted
i mean
maybe i can't rule it out but it sure
looks like it's written
doesn't it
i mean it looks exactly like it's
scripted
it's the weirdest thing now i'm sure
that's just a psychological
phenomenon that it looks like it's
scripted
but it sure looks like it
um
and
now what do you think do you believe
that kids can actually give themselves a
medical condition
tourette's
do you think you can give somebody a
medical condition just by watching it
yup
if you didn't think this was possible
then there's a level of
understanding about people that you need
to get to
yeah this is really easy
in fact you could do videos on any
medical condition
and it would induce it in some
percentage of the people watching it
now it might not induce the real one you
know they don't have actual tourettes
but you could induce people to believe
they had it
pretty easily now
you the reason that you don't believe
this is possible is that you think well
it wouldn't happen to me
i mean it's not gonna happen to me you
might be right
because you're talking about millions of
people looking at something
if hundreds out of the millions have an
effect
you know most people don't have the
effect so probably it wouldn't affect
you
odds are that any one of you
would have no effect by watching this
material
but there are a lot of people who would
i got a uh
a comment on my tweet about this
from a
doctor
thomas talbot md he said yup
i'd get a quote multiple personality
girl whose parents are requesting an mri
in the er
every time cable shows the film sybil
so there's an old movie about
a woman who allegedly had multiple
personalities whenever that show is on
cable
people come in and say hey
my teenage daughter got multiple
personalities check this out
apparently this happens so often that
it's just well known by medical
professionals
now
how many of you are surprised by that
because i wasn't
was not surprised at all
yeah you shouldn't be surprised so i
think many of you are well well trained
on that by now
now let me ask you this
if you know that tick tock can induce a
medical condition in some number of
people
and you know that china
owns and controls tick tock yeah the
chinese government has enough control
that they can make them do whatever they
want it's a chinese company
and
doesn't this suggest that china can
control our politics
how could you listen to this story
and know that tick tock
by its algorithm can induce
tourettes
or tourette symptoms not actual threats
but it can induce tourette's symptoms
in enough people that it's a news story
you don't think they can
influence our politics from from china
through tick tock
they can
maybe not this generation i mean the
voting generation but they're definitely
getting the next one
the the next generation is going to be
the tick tock of voters
and whatever influence they've had on
tick tock is going to
go with them into the voting booth so
yeah
the chinese government can program you
they now have the technology not every
one of you
but enough to change an election
ted cruz continues to be magnificent
now i'm not
the biggest ted cruz fan in the world
and i did not support him for president
and you know last election
but he has many awesome qualities which
i like to call out
[Laughter]
and
and he's also really good
at figuring out what he needs to correct
and then correcting it how many times
have i told you what problems kamala
harris has
you know that the giggling too much and
acting like she's having an orgasm when
she talks
have you ever seen that kamala harris
she acts like she's having an orgasm
when she starts to answer a question she
levels off after she starts talking but
the first
the first sentence or two
from kabul harris on any question will
look like the beginning of an orgasm you
watch it
you watch it
yeah i will do a demonstration
thank you for begging for it
yes i am going to do my impression of
kamala harris answering any question
whatsoever
how happy are you now
yeah here it comes
i now give you my impression of kamal
harris answering a question
what's the weather look like today
goblin
sunny with a chance of clouds
tell me i'm wrong
you watch her the next time she gives an
interview but watch the first answer
all right
it's the way she starts the answer it's
not the way she ends it she ends it
normal
but she starts it like
[Music]
uh it's gonna be uh cloudy today
all right so ted cruz i believe i was
talking about ted cruz not kamala harris
and her
involuntary orgasms while answering
questions but rather
ted cruz being awesome so he's
introduced a stop the surge act
that would open up 13 new immigration
processing centers
in different communities across the
country that's that's very enlightened
of him you really wouldn't expect that
if tom of ted cruz would you
you know you think of ted cruz as sort
of an anti-anti-immigration
i mean illegal immigration not
anti-immigration nobody's
anti-immigration
people can be anti-illegal immigrant
immigration for sure
but that's very enlightened and uh
you don't really expect that from a
republican do you
did i leave anything out
is there any context missing from the
story oh yes there's a little context
missing for the story
these 13 new immigration processing
centers will not be in places near the
border
who are getting completely screwed by
their government
no no these new centers will be in
places like martha's vineyard
martha's vineyard an excellent place to
process
hundreds of thousands of illegal
immigrants
also governors island in new york
palo alto new york and i think bernie
sanders town in vermont
so he picked 13 places where the elites
don't ever have to worry about too much
immigration and he wants to open up
immigration centers in their towns
now what are the odds that this act will
be passed well zero right i mean there's
no way it's going to be passed but that
was not really the point of it it wasn't
the point of it was to make a point
how well did ted cruz make this point
national news at least fox news is
covering it i don't think it's on cnn
so it's national news
and it absolutely makes the case
i'll tell you
i still don't know
yeah i don't know if ted cruz would be a
good or bad president someday i i expect
you might see a president ted cruz
i feel like that's in the future i don't
know when
but i feel like he's sort of an obvious
one
you might get a turn you know there are
half a dozen people you think
well they probably all get a turn
i think he's in the half dozen who might
get a turn someday
this is just awesome i love watching ted
cruz
interrogate
witnesses in congress
no matter what you think of him as a you
know politician
watching him do his lawyer kind of
talent stack is just really fun
because because he's so good at it
and this is just great this is just
great persuasion great communication
great politicking
great republicaning
everything about this is good
there's nothing bad about this this is a
100 win
for ted cruz and obviously he doesn't
expect it to be passed
but here's the interesting thing
the midterm the midterms are coming up
the midterms is coming up
and the prediction is i think
the republicans only need to flip five
seats right to get control of congress
and typically it flips 25 in an off year
when when you've got a president from
the other party is in power blah blah so
typically we'd expect 25
and the number of people have already
announced a number of democrats have
already announced retirements
so we already have enough people
retiring that if things just sort of
went normally
republicans would take control
do you think ted cruz will circle back
on this
maybe take another run at it
because
i kind of like to see this law get
passed like in a real sense
i realize he's doing it just for
persuasion and communication
but let's really do it
because this really would change things
he's not wrong
he's not wrong that the problem here is
that the people who don't have to suffer
the problem are the ones making the
decisions
so
he's saying maybe get you a little
closer to the problem and you would make
different decisions he's not wrong
if you get the decision makers closer to
the problem they will make different
decisions
we know that just watching them try to
wash wear masks
right as long as the decision makers
don't have to wear masks themselves
they're fine making you do it
but what happens you know when they have
to wear masks
don't always put them on do they
so he's right in every way on this
um more police are dying from
coronavirus than from bullets like a lot
and 20 i see since uh
let's see
the leading cause since the start of the
pandemic
476 police officers have died of colon
that's a lot isn't it
because it's not like the police have a
ton of comorbidities compared to the
regular public do they
i feel like police would be younger
and on average more fit you know not all
of them
somebody says they're overweight
but i don't think compared to the public
i don't know
so
um but only 94 which of course is still
tragically high number
died from gunfire in the same period so
476 died of covid 94 from gunfire
now is it fair to give us that context
do you feel that you learn something by
that context
well i did for the it's it's the first
time i've
sort of had a sense of how many
police officers are getting shot
and killed and how many people are dying
from covet so i feel like it filled in
you know some gaps i'm not sure i needed
it necessarily it didn't change any
opinions but here's my real question
why are they only treating the police
this way
why not
do the same kind of context for let's
say the black
american public
i'm kind of interested
to see the same kind of treatment for
black americans
are are more black americans dying from
covet
or from violence
do you know
how many of you could answer that
question right now
now if you if you look in chicago it's
probably more violence than cohen but
let's say you took the whole country
how many of you know the answer that are
there more
black citizens dying from covid
or from
let's say gun violence
um
yeah that's right we
now i remind you that i identify as
black
so we're talking about
uh my the group i identify with
um
i'm seeing in the comments nobody knows
the answer to that question why not
why why only the police we put in this
context but we don't put black america
which we know is getting hit harder by
the virus
now i'm not saying
i'm not saying it would change any
decisions or anything but i feel like
john cook says you're not black
people on locals
the the people on um
who are watching right now on youtube
they're saying i'm not black
where have you been
do you get to decide what i identify as
when did that happen
my understanding is i'm the one who gets
to tell you what i am and you don't get
to say anything about that
those are the rules i didn't make them
up i'm only using the rules i'm using
the rules as they exist and you know
what
i'm serious
i'm serious
i identify as black
because i've been discriminated against
for my race continuously
for decades
and so i just feel some connection to
people who
who have their life defined by
discrimination
that's completely fair
now is it true that i'm discriminated
exactly the same way and have the same
life experience of course not
but it's not up to you to decide how i
identify is it
it's not up to you
that's the only rule
it's not up to you
so
i appreciate that you have a different
opinion
about what i am or what i should
identify as but it's just not up to you
that's it
all right um
a tragic story happened but it only
affects me
tragedy uh on celebrity wheel of fortune
uh
actress melissa joan hart who is famous
for
the sabrina the teenage witch
series that ran years ago
so she competed on a celebrity version
of wheel of fortune and became the first
contestant to win a million dollar prize
i think first celebrity but also first
contestant to win a million dollar prize
in celebrity wheel of fortune why is
this a tragedy to me
anybody
anybody
why is this a personal tragedy to me
why does this story affect me
does anybody know
all right i'll tell you the story
i too
have appeared on celebrity wheel of
fortune
but it was a a
local affiliate version so in the bay
area and it didn't it was not
broadcast outside the bay area
years ago
i don't know 20 years ago 15 years ago
i appeared as a contestant on celebrity
wheel of fortune and my partner because
we were playing partners i guess they
played partners so they could get more
celebrities on there
so my partner was
melissa joan hart
so i was partnered with melissa jonehart
on celebrity wheel of fortune
we lost like dogs that's right we lost
badly
now i think i did okay
but melissa was not let's say a strong
player
if i can be kind she was not what you'd
call a strong player and we lost like
dogs
but
then she went on
to win the most money anybody's ever won
on this same thing
to which i must ask myself
was the problem
her
[Laughter]
did we lose because of her
and now she's gone on to win the largest
prize ever in the same contest
maybe it was me
now in my defense
she was very young when she was
partnered with me and if you put you
know basically it's a trivia contest in
a sense it was like a trivia contest
um because you had to answer to the
clues as well as
what letters were up there
so
uh i don't think it's unfair to say that
a young person is going to do worse in a
trivia contest
do we all agree on that
a young person
generally will do worse on a trivia
contest just because they haven't been
around as long
so when i was paired with her i was
paired with a young person and uh who
won the trivia contest slash wheel of
fortune contest the oldest competitors
no surprise right the people been around
the longest one of them was a nba player
who retired so he'd been around a while
and i think his team won
so the team had just been around the
longest
one but anyway made me feel bad not
really it was just a fun connection
well the adam's law of slow moving
disasters you've heard of this before it
says that whenever there's some uh
you know planetary disaster coming
toward us but we have plenty of time to
prepare for it
we do okay and we invent our way out of
it
did we have population out of control no
we figured out how to do
you know
population control did we run in a food
no we invented tractors and fertilizers
and better ways to farm did we run out
of
fuel
no
because we had time and so we just
learned how to frack and make
you know solar panels and stuff like
that
so whenever we've got time we do fix it
we're very good at that and of course
i've always predicted that
climate change
would be a perfect example of this
that somebody would invent something
maybe more than one person would invent
things that would get us out of any
climate change catastrophes
and it would be plenty of time well
today we learned that x
spacex engineers so spacex tesla's
company i'm sorry elon musk's company
some of them
when they i guess they were working on
designing small nuclear reactors for
mars
you know because you would need power on
mars if you want to
settle it
and they learned how to make cheap
portable nuclear ones or enough that
they thought they could make a startup
and finish the job
and they have designed these portable
nuclear reactors now so far it's only
designed i think on paper but they're
pretty confident they can make them with
fuel that doesn't melt down
and it will power a thousand homes the
electricity for a thousand homes and it
looks like it's portable enough you can
put it on a truck
i mean that's how i interpret it i think
that's what they mean by portable
would be a big truck of course
so what do you think of that
if this if this is true and it works
and there's a startup that can really
make small
completely safe portable nuclear
reactors i guess they have to be
refueled every four to eight years or
something
everything's different
it's all different
right it changes everything
nothing would be the same if this works
i don't i'm not sure if you all
understand how big a deal this is
not only is it like one of the biggest
deals in the history of humanity
but apparently it's easy to build
now when i say easy i mean the people
who are doing it seem to think they can
make it
they're not saying we have to solve some
problem
they're saying yeah we got some patents
give us a couple years
we'll slap these together and start
selling them
everything's different
because of this now it might not be this
startup that makes it work do you think
it's the only startup working on small
nuclear reactors
nope there's a bunch of them
and maybe yeah in the comments i'm
saying maybe fusion someday but that
would be a little bit further behind
so that's your good news
that's coming up
um
i keep being asked on
on twitter was said i'm on
talking specifically about vaccinations
and pandemic
people asking what side i'm on
was said i'm on
what
as far as i can tell
it looks like the virus against human
beings am i wrong
that that the war that's going on is
virus versus human beings
what do you think i'm on the side of the
 virus
no i'm on the side of human beings
like humans
i know this confuses you
but i can't be on the side of people
against a virus
don't be confused about this i'm on your
side
unless unless there's a virus watching
right now
get off of your virus all right just
people
only people are invited to watch this no
viruses
now i know what you mean you're saying
oh is he pro this or anti that because
you're pro this or anti that i'm not pro
or anti anything
i'm just following the data wherever it
goes
and it's changing
if you're not changing your opinion as
the data is changing
you have some explaining to do
if the data is changing and your opinion
is staying the same
you need to explain that
it's not up to me to explain it you need
to explain why your opinion isn't
changing as the data changes
now
a lot of people are saying that the
government was lying to them and baiting
and switching about these vaccinations
that are not real vaccinations let's
call them covered shots
because they're barely vaccinations at
all according to your strict definition
of the word
so i asked the question how many people
this is just a twitter poll so it's
highly unscientific how many people
think the government knew all along
that these quote vaccinations were more
like a therapeutic
how many people think the government
knew all along that they would not be
full vaccinations like some vaccinations
are
68
of the people who follow me and saw that
and decided to use it the poll
said that the government was lying all
along and knew that the vaccinations
would not be like regular vaccinations
26 think that the government was honest
but they just were wrong and they're
just sort of doing the best they can
and seven percent no opinion
here's my take on this if the government
was lying all along
where are all the whistleblowers
because this alleged lying
as opposed to just being wrong
this alleged lying
would involve a lot of people
a lot of people would be involved with
the trials the testing looking at the
data you'd have the fda the cdc the
government you know scientists all over
the place
i would think thousands of people are
looking at this stuff
so
no no whistleblower coming out and
saying you know behind closed doors
we always knew
we always knew behind closed doors that
this wasn't going to work
but we decided to say it would because
you know
we just wanted you to take the
vaccinations
no whistleblowers
all right so my my view is that the
government was simply
too optimistic
they were wrong
and they're doing the best they can to
adjust
so we hoped it would be 100 effective
it's not but it does keep you from dying
most of the time
that's pretty good
that's pretty good
now people are accusing me of
some kind of
moving the goal posts or being wrong
and the common comment i see about
myself
is that
uh
i'm embarrassed at how wrong i was
in some prediction about vaccinations
and therefore i'm you know trying to
back battle and make myself look right
in some way
i would remind you
that i believe only one one
public pundit
as opposed to a scientist i believe only
one public pundit at the beginning of
the pandemic said to you
even after warp speed had begun
i believe that only one person said to
you
i don't think the vaccines will work but
we're going to surprise ourselves at how
good the therapeutics are
who else said that i think i'm the only
one
i heard nobody else say that
now why did i say that the vaccinations
would not work
i said it for the following reason
that i was aware because i followed the
news and the scientists told us
that they'd been working on a
coronavirus
vaccination for i don't know decades
and they weren't even close
you all knew that right
did you all know from the very beginning
that science had been trying to make a
coronavirus vaccination for decades i
think it's decades
and we're not even close
so why would you believe they could do
it in one year
why would you believe that
that is not credible on on its surface
unless they had said
unless they had said we we did invent
this new thing just the other day
and so now everything's different
because this new thing we invented just
the other day
i didn't hear that did you
did anybody say uh but here's the game
changer we we got this this idea and now
this idea might be the thing that
changes everything
no
no well the mrna stuff is new
but i didn't hear anybody say we've we
have therefore figured out how to solve
coronavirus
nobody connected those two thoughts yes
it's new
but i did not hear anybody who was an
expert say
we have this new technology and while we
have not been able to solve a
vaccination for decades this new
technology will be able to do it i
didn't hear anybody say that did you
i'm not saying nobody said it but i
didn't hear it
somebody says i did
all right so my point is that
in theory i should not have cognitive
dissonance in this situation and i might
be alone
i might be the only one except for the
scientists who knew
apparently a lot of scientists knew that
this vaccination would not be a complete
solution
but so when it turns out that uh our
optimism about the vaccinations uh
didn't come in
and rather they're they're just pretty
good they're pretty good in a
therapeutic sense or in a
pre-therapeutic sense i guess
prophylactic sense
but
i'm not surprised because this is what i
thought would happen
this is exactly what i predicted so
since i don't have any trigger for
cognitive dissonance
you should assume that my view is the
least biased
in a very narrow sense on this just
narrow question because i don't have a
trigger
everybody who thought it was going to go
one way and then was surprised
you've got a trigger
so you might have cognitive dissonance
because there's a reason to trigger it i
don't have a trigger
now now i would also say that a person
who has a trigger probably thinks they
don't have one either so you would be a
better judge whether i have a trigger
here or not the whole point of cognitive
dissonance is the person who has it
doesn't know it
so if i really do right so so sandra
says you're deluded
that's a fair assessment
if you can find my
trigger so
i don't deny that i'm deluded because it
would feel exactly the same to me
as if i were not
right
i wouldn't know i'm not the worst the
only person who can't tell
is the person who has the delusion
everybody else can see it maybe
so look for my trigger if you can find
one then maybe you have a point but if
you can't find one the smarter the
smarter way to look at this would be
that
um
holy
um
so 100 comment says
i say quote i'm on the side of science
right now the fda is recommending people
not get their antibodies checked after
the fisa whistleblower confirmed the vex
wasn't 100 effective telling people not
to get their antibodies checked isn't
following the science
yeah
i'll give you that
i will give you that
i think the reason
this is just my speculation i think the
reason the government isn't using tests
as a proxy or a replacement for or a
substitute for vaccinations is that it's
not practical
for everybody to do it i guess
i'm just guessing there
uh don
don in the comments over here on youtube
is questioning why somebody spent a
hundred dollars to i guess tip me or
whatever it is to get me to read that
comment
don let me explain something to you
although a hundred dollars does not
change my lifestyle
etc i am completely influenced by it
you just watched it
do you don't think he got a hundred
dollars worth i just stopped the show in
the middle to read the hundred dollar
comment
that was worth a hundred dollars to
whoever spent it obviously they had a
hundred dollars they didn't need right
and uh
used to be liberals were anti-vaxx
yeah and that all just just changed for
reasons that aren't clear maybe it was
trump all right um
let's see
uh
katie couric is uh
working hard to destroy whatever is left
of her reputation so she's got a new
book out
and one of the
outrages in the book is that when she
interviewed ruth bader ginsburg
she took out a comment where
ginsberg had said that people who take
the knee at sporting events like
kaepernick et cetera are a quote showing
contempt for a government that has made
it possible for their parents and
grandparents to live a decent life
and kirk said that she took that out she
edited it out
because
she thought that the justice ginsburg
who was 83 at the time
was quote elderly and probably didn't
fully understand the question
um
um
katie
katie can i speak to you for a moment
personally can we talk
katie
correct me if i'm wrong but you are in
the news business
you know ish
wouldn't that be the biggest story in
the world
if one of the supreme court justices
was mentally incompetent to the point of
not understanding a simple question
katie if you
believed that she was mentally
incompetent at that level couldn't
understand the question
that was the story
that's the story
not the part about
colin kaepernick and kneeling i think
you buried the lead
the lead story is that katie couric
believed one of the supreme court
justices was mentally incompetent
and somehow that isn't the story today
like literally have you heard anybody
even mention that i'm probably the first
person who said wait a minute
there's a story here about you know a
national figure
katie couric
who believed enough that that ginsburg
was mentally incompetent that she hid it
from her public
you've got two gigantic stories here
one is that she buried the incompetence
when she witnessed herself
in her opinion
of boehner's competence
and the second part of the story that
she buried it
she hid it from the public
what
now she says this is common
it's common for the news to you know
edit out
i don't know what
inconvenient things things that make the
person
look bad
wow
that's quite a story
well have you heard that the
infrastructure bill is still stalled
another prediction that i feel quite
proud about
is that i think i'm the only person who
who told you again the only person as
far as i know the only person who told
you the infrastructure bill just would
never get signed
and it looks like that's going to happen
because i think we're going to blaze
into 2022
with no infrastructure bill
at which point the republicans are back
in charge
theoretically
and at which point it's dead
so i don't know if anybody else said it
will never get signed i think i'm the
only one
check me on that
but
a new cbs poll found that only 10
percent of respondents said they knew
quote a lot about the specifics a voice
in the the 3.5 trillion dollar spending
package
pelosi
agreed that they could do a better job
of selling it because only 10 understand
it
and she she said the media has done has
not done justice to the list of items in
the bill
and it's hard to break through when you
have such a comprehensive package
well
what is it i always say about
republicans and trump in particular that
i say as a criticism
about the democrats it's always the same
thing
democrats
consistently
don't understand how human beings work
they don't understand human nature
do you think that trump
ever would have tried to sell a super
complicated 3.5 billion dollar package
of anything
of anything
hell no
do you know why
because trump understands human nature
and he knows you can't you can't
understand this
now he might try to sell it you know if
he was trying to you know just maybe get
a defense package through and figures
nobody's going to look at the details
too much i'm sure he did that
but
if it came to something where the public
was actually interested enough to know
the details
he would have known you can't sell this
the democrats put together a package
which cannot be sold
to human beings
let me say it again
the democrats
slowly and methodically and with lots of
time to do it
put together a thing they tried to sell
which by its nature cannot be sold to
human beings
because we don't know what it is
it's too complicated you can't say yes
can't say no
you know basically you would just
retreat to your side and say well my
side seems to like this or my side seems
to hate it
but it's so consistent that democrats
don't understand human nature it's
almost a defining characteristic of the
party
yeah you could have done a better job of
selling that by not making it that
um
brian stelter continues to be humorously
uh
let's say humorously
um what would be the word brian stelter
continues to be humorously
i don't want to say incompetent because
he isn't incompetent
uh
humorously clownish or something i don't
know
but
apparently uh his show that's about the
media
you know is called uh
what's the name of his show reliable
sources
which is funny um
so apparently they don't cover stories
that are he doesn't cover any stories
that are embarrassing to the uh to the
liberals
and it's getting kind of noticeable
he just sort of leaves it out doesn't
cover it and if you're if your whole job
is covering what the media does right or
wrong and it's about reliable sources
and you just ignore stories that are
sort of embarrassing to your network
not too cool
now on the fox network uh howard kurtz
has a show that you could say is a rough
equivalent
you know it's also about the media
and the media's activities during the
week
and i think
correct me if i'm wrong but doesn't
howard kurtz criticize everybody and
cover every story
i think he does right
is there anybody who would push back on
that
that
howard kurtz just covers the actual news
whereas uh brian stelter is only
covering the stuff that isn't
embarrassing
i'm right about that right i mean i'm
not sure i've watched every show
but
um it feels like that
all right
um speaking about trump was right
uh i guess the statue of thomas
jefferson's being removed
from city council chambers in new york
because jefferson was a big old slave
owner here's something i didn't know
that this story told me that not only
was he a slave owner but he had he owned
more slaves
than any of the other presidents who we
know to have owned slaves
he owned over 600 of them
plus he fathered about six and a whole
bunch of them were like related which
was kind of weird
and to which i say
to which i say
i don't have a problem with this
i don't have a problem with this
updating our heroes
and i know this is going to make you
have a heart attack some of you
but i'm not really afraid of change and
i'm not afraid of
um
i'm not afraid of changing who we decide
as a hero
i'm not afraid of changing that and i
also think that maybe we should put a
little more attention on what was done
versus the personalities
if you look at what jefferson did
in terms of you know his accomplishments
those accomplishments are amazing
um
oh here's a comment from dracus
understanding human nature is empathy
republicans have empathy but lack
sympathy
democrats have sympathy but lack empathy
hmm i'm not sure i can sign off on that
but i like where you're going on that
i'm not sure i see what you're saying
but i do like
the quality of that the quality of that
thought
um
so here's here's my thing if the point
of heroes
is to make you
you know appreciate
their character
that's the point of heroes right
the point of heroes is that we
appreciate their character not just
their accomplishments
and to me it seems perfectly fair that
the person who owned the most slaves
you don't necessarily want to show as
your character hero
now could we still treat um
jefferson as a
let's say a hero in terms of some of the
things he got done
yes
yes
i mean the best writer maybe ever
i mean the the writing and the
declaration of independence it's hard to
know who who wrote exactly what in that
but
some of the best writing i've ever seen
and i'm a fan of good writing
so he was amazing in a lot of ways but
the other thing about jefferson did you
know he he died in debt
apparently jefferson was always poor
but somehow jefferson found a way to
live like a rich person
while just being in debt he left a
massive debt when he died i believe
that's true fact check me on that so he
so jefferson obviously had some
what we would consider massive character
flaws
judged by 2021 standards now i hear
people saying
scott scott stop judging people
by 2021 standards
because they were products of their time
to which i say well that's a true
statement
but why should i
why should i be limited by that
why should that affect me
because i live in 2021.
in 2021 i would rather have a role model
whose character is suggestive of the
character you would want in 2021
why would i want a role model who
doesn't quite apply
because he's from the wrong
period now i understand the point the
point is well taken
that it's hard to judge people in a
different time period that's fair
but if you're deciding who's your role
model
it could be whoever you are you can
change your mind whenever you want
why can't you change your mind
there's no limit on that
now i hear what you're saying about and
i know you're thinking this
that if you start tearing down the
traditions you end up tearing down the
whole country
i hear that and that's a risk
i feel like there's something to that
but i don't think
i just don't think we're a healthier
country holding a slave
a massive slave owner
as our character
hero
accomplishment hero yes he can still be
an accomplishment hero
but character hero
i think we're i think we've outgrown
that haven't we
now i realize it's painful to watch your
heroes get uprooted
but keep in mind
i'm also
anti-putting up a statue of george floyd
all right
taking down
if you take down the statue of jefferson
and you put up a statue of floyd
you did not improve the situation
we have to be a little bit consistent
here well we don't have to be but
wouldn't it be nice
to be consistent
if somebody has a sketchy character
it doesn't matter what else happened to
them
you know if you're choosing heroes
here a hero a character hero has to have
a good character
otherwise why are you putting him on a
statue
jefferson did many good things at his
economic expense i don't know that
i don't know that
all right but i would like to point out
that there are two presidents that did
not own slaves back in those days does
anybody know the two presidents who did
not own slaves
back in the days when a lot of them did
who were they
john adams correct
who's the other one his son john quincy
adams
only the adams family
was on the correct side of history
in fact john adams famously
as a lawyer defended
a slave from some famous case
so
so not only was john adams anti-slavery
he was actively you know giving a fair
defense to at least at least one notable
case that i know of
now
uh
you're probably wondering if i'm related
to the adam's presidents
uh we did look into that the family
looked into that at one point because we
didn't know we thought well maybe
we're not descended from
so that part we're pretty confident
about we did not descend from directly
from that line
but we do uh connect back in england so
if
if you go back far enough
you know my line goes back to england as
well as other places other european
places as well
but we're probably
probably connected somewhere
probably connected somewhere
all right
the rest were virginians somebody says
oh that's a good point
the rest were virginians so they were
more likely to be slave owners
a fair comment fair comment
all right that
is my program for today um
well we're still talking about colin
powell
yeah i saw tucker carlson gave a very
very uh
fair and i thought respectful account
of uh colin powell's accomplishments
um
scott do you think the old the old
statues in the south it should come down
well number one it's not my call
all right so the the local people should
decide what statues they have so it's
not up to me that's number one number
two if i were a local person i would be
open to the argument that they're
offensive to enough people
that they really should be seen as a
decoration and not a historical thing
if you want to preserve the history
put it in the historical context
you know don't put it in the park and
say hey everybody this is awesome
we'll put it in the park
so i do agree with the people who say
putting up offensive statues to people
who are pro-slavery
is not cool it makes us feel
uncomfortable and let's get rid of these
i'm okay with that
i'm not afraid to change
unless the change is to replace it with
a statue of george floyd in which case
the whole thing is just ridiculous
you're either you either care about the
whole character of the person you're
putting in the statue or you don't
right if you care you don't do either
one and if you don't well then you can
do both
you are not local to new york and take
that's right
so it is not up to me
and my opinion should carry no weight
in the case of the new york so i don't
think i'm disagreeing with you i think
i'm agreeing with you that i can have
internal thoughts and i can share them
with you but not my decision you're
right
same thing i say about abortion by the
way
the same thing i say about abortion i
can have an internal opinion
but i'm going to keep it there
because i'd rather that women
collectively have you know more of the
influence on that decision that's the
world i want to live in i want to live
in a world where women
far more than the men
are making the decisions on what's legal
what's appropriate with abortion
now remember we're not going to get the
right answer
because half of the world is going to be
mad no matter which way those laws go
but at least they're a little bit more
credible
when women are behind the law
so that's my simp
miles
let me talk to you here for a moment
so over on the locals platform
somebody's calling me a simp
i assume for just supporting women on
that question instead of having my own
opinion
that is my opinion
i'm not giving women what they want just
because they want it
that's my opinion
my opinion is i don't want to be part of
the decision
i'm making my own opinion
i don't care what what your opinion is
and i don't care if it makes women
happier or less happy
you get that right
the point is not to make women happy
that's the i i assume that the
the point of a simp
is somebody who's making you know a
woman happy at their own expense right
that's sort of the definition
i i have no no interest in this topic
to just make women happy
i'm just saying that the way you make
decisions
is you put the people who have the most
skin in the game
give them a little more more control
over the decision it's just better
system it's about the system it's not
about
any of that stuff
um put up a statue of colin powell
he's got some things to explain about
weapons of mass destruction and i don't
think we can overlook that
yeah all women don't agree
exactly but i shouldn't be
biasing their decision
the decision to procreate was made
together i agree
yeah i mean
it's not a clean argument
that this is not the kind of debate
where all of the
you know all of the good points are on
one side
if all of the good points were on one
side i'd give you an opinion
and i feel like oh this is easy
all of the good points are on the same
side
but it's so subjective
that that doesn't make sense
um yeah and i and and by the way i
appreciate and respect all of your
opinions on that topic
and that is all
um
we have a call from charlie here he
wants more naked statues
i think i'm down for that i think our
statue should be more naked
no reason
but
i like naked statues just as much as the
next person
he at least apologized for that mistake
who is
s-lags that everybody is thanking
so there's some user over there that's
being is it a user
whoever s-lacks is is being very popular
all right i gotta run
and i think you'll agree
that this live stream
highlight of your day
yeah
wait till tomorrow
it's gonna be so good tomorrow
all right
