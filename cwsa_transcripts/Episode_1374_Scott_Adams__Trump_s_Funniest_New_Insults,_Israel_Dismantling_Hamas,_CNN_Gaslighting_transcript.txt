hey everybody come on in
it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams
and if you missed that you have missed
the best part of your day and you don't

strong and all you need is a copper bug
or glass a tanker challenge time to
canteen juggle glass vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine the

you know the rest you know the thing
join me now for the simultaneous sip
go
that's good
well in my ongoing segment called
democrats eat their own
ellen degeneres has announced that she's
quitting her show because the
she was accused a while ago of a toxic
workplace
and ratings tanked because people didn't
want to watch a show with somebody who
was
pretending to be all nice
but running a toxic
toxic
workplace
and uh ellen has responded and she says
that
the toxic work
claims were a coordinated misogynistic
attack on her
because she's a woman
and she couldn't have known the staff
were unhappy
huh
what would a way
be a way to know
that your staff is unhappy
it's too bad there's no way to know
so i guess ellen's off the hook
because if you manage a staff and you
work with them closely
all day long
five days a week for 19 years
i don't know how you could possibly
detect
any unhappiness
i mean what would you do
talk to people
maybe look at their reactions
get a little feedback
really there was nowhere to no way to go
there so ellen
really had no choice
she couldn't have known her staff was
unhappy
but apparently the women who are saying
bad things about her including a
woman producer
are part of the coordinated misogynistic
attack
so not only is it a coordinated
misogynistic attack
but it's being done by women
it's the worst kind of misogynistic
attack woman on woman crime i'm sure
there's some men in there too
i saw a video by um it's on the fox news
site
virginia lieutenant governor nominee
winsome sears
now i recommend you watch the video
because uh you've never seen somebody
with so much charisma
and someone who the camera loves
i mean the camera loves her meaning that
her charisma on camera
just like oh it's like it's like this
bright beam
and
uh interestingly she's republican and
she came in against critical race theory
and branded it nonsense
now if that's not good enough
she's an ex-marine
how would you like to be
a black
republican woman
who's you know prominent in at least
state politics
be an ex-marine
and be great on camera
i would watch out for this one
keep an eye on her because i don't think
this is her last job in politics if she
gets the first one we'll see if she wins
but boy does she have the whole package
it takes you approximately
four seconds
to say what am i watching here oh crap
this is the real deal now i could be
wrong because literally i'm judging her
on you know just a little appearance on
tv
but
good luck doing that well on tv
if you're anybody else i mean it's not
easy
to come across that well on tv
especially if you're new to it and she
nailed it
um
so the
situation with israel and hamas is
heating up
allegedly the palestinian militants have
stockpiled
enough missiles to continue bombing
israel for the next two months
how do we know that
how do we know how many missiles
hamas has
if we know how many they have
don't we know where they are
because how can you know how many there
they have unless you also know where
they are
i mean i i don't know exactly how we
would have that intel but let's say we
do
um
so a number of things are happening on
this story aoc criticized biden for only
saying that israel has a right to defend
itself and as she described
without having any words at all
about what the other side is complaining
about or what it is they want or
or how they've been treated aoc says
that it's uh terribly unfair
but you have to look at you know the
causes of this
you know the unrest
to which i say
no you don't
i can't think of a bigger waste of time
than to look for the nuance
because
everywhere else in the world
it seems i mean just perceptually it
seems that if you know who's right
and you know who's wrong
that would allow you to do something
differently
such as put somebody in jail or
free somebody from some allegations or
something like that but none of that
applies in the middle east it's just
power yeah any argument you make about
why someone should have done something
or who was really the cause but
if they were the cause what about the
cause before that
but who caused that
how far do you go none of this is useful
i'm all for understanding situations
but once you understand it
richard thomas let's talk to richard
thomas here
so dick
um i know you're being a dick
scott's a right wing shell first of all
i'm left to bernie
so get informed
so when you make public public comments
like this you don't look like a
idiot
now i'm not saying that you shouldn't
criticize me
i'm fine with criticism
but your criticism should at least be
in the same general category as the
topic
for example if you were to criticize the
pope
for let's say
sagging his pants
would that be fair
ah the pope should not wear sagged pants
but you know he doesn't
so if he were to criticize the pope in
public
for wearing his pants sagged
you would be a idiot
because
you're not even on the right topic
all right
i think we were talking about israel and
hamas
but i just had to respond to a deck
so if they've got this many weapons and
israel's got to do something it looks
like netanyahu has taken out and
israel's military
has taken out nine
hamas leaders
how many do they have
how many leaders are there in hamas and
if you are a hamas leader let's say
you're in the top 10
and your team starts firing some
missiles
don't you know you're dead that night
israel is pretty consistent about this
well let's say
are you firing missiles into israel
tonight
yes or no
yes
will you be alive by morning if you're
one of the top commanders in hamas
no
okay
do i care that they got killed nope
don't care about them whatsoever
do i think that we should have a
balanced approach
over there
we could but what's the point
what would be the point
nothing's going to change
because we think it's somebody's fault
or somebody else's fault none of this
has anything to do with anything it's
just going to be what it is it's just
power
if israel has the power they'll squash
this problem and if they don't they
won't but there's nothing else to be
said about it
israel will of course look to find any
advantage in it as they're they're
they're good at doing
uh historically
and they'll probably come out ahead so
at the moment netanyahu is uh
here's the funniest part
like i i don't even know how to
how to understand this next part
apparently hamas has asked for a
ceasefire
what
what
hamas asked for a ceasefire
are you freaking kidding me
this is not ceasefire situation this is
like somebody rapes and kills your wife
right in front of you and then you start
to kill them in revenge and they go whoa
whoa
let's have a little cease-fire here but
let's not get out of control just
because i raped and killed your wife
let's not let's not make this
disproportional
i said ceasefire
so let's cease fire
unless you're like a bloodthirsty crazy
people
take the ceasefire
no this is not ceasefire's situation
maybe if you had a war
you know they've been going on for a
while
you'd reach some kind of a conclusion
somebody won somebody lost
i can see you might want a ceasefire
but not for a terrorist act
i don't think there's any doubt that
israel is going to send in ground forces
does anybody have any doubt about that
i don't see any possibility there won't
be ground forces
so that's my prediction
because israel has a big opening now the
the attack was so much
the israel can go do terrible things
that it couldn't have done before
and sometimes you have to do terrible
things to get something done for
national security
so i think that hamas just gave
israel a free pass to do whatever the
hell they want
and whatever the hell they want is going
to be pretty pretty bad
for hamas
so
i don't even know if israel is coming
out behind i think israel is going to
come out ahead actually
by
knocking down hamas a little bit
so apparently hamas is using a
gps guided
suicide drones so cheap drones
that instead of controlling them the
whole way they just give it a gps
coordinate apparently and just have it
go off and
and do something now i think that they
do it by gps the reporting's a little
bit
um sketch on that so maybe it's being
guided all the way to its target but it
did talk about you know miles and miles
of travel so i don't know if the signal
would reach the these cheap drones
too well because they're it's not like
they're using satellites or anything
so
i predicted the drone
the
the direction guided sort of self
self uh
self-guiding uh drones back in 2004 in
my book the religion war which was a
sequel to
god's debris
the origin the religion war had the
following primary plot it was set
approximately 20 years in the future
it was set now all right so in 2004 the
the time period for that book
was basically now
and the
the idea was that terrorists in the
middle east
would
start using drones
and that they would eventually come to
the homeland in this case america
and that um
the bad people in order to keep their
own power and to keep their population
happy
would have to keep attacking the west
to have some credibility
so they don't want to win because they
can't really like just defeat all the
western powers or whatever they can't
really defeat israel but they can pester
forever
and if they pester enough
it just keeps them in power but if they
pester too much
then there's going to be a giant war and
so the book is about that
solving that problem
which is that the terrorists have a
reason to continue being terrorists and
they start using drones and they put
chemicals on them now it seems to me
that because these cheap drones don't
weigh much and they can't carry much in
terms of bombs
that the obvious way this is going to go
is to is chemical wear warfare
wouldn't you agree
and i don't feel like i'm giving them
the idea or anything because it's just
too obvious the lowest
weight you could carry would be a
chemical
so as soon as the people who have the
drones have access to bad chemicals
whatever they might be i think you're
going to see that now when that happens
that should provoke a response that
would be bigger than just about any
response you've ever seen
so it would be a response similar to you
know hiroshima and nagasaki kind of
thing
so i think that's where things are going
um
maybe in the next five years
all right
here's a plan for how to control the
country you ready let's say you had a
country that was a democracy
ish and you wanted to
take control
here's a way to do it number one
persuade this public to follow the
science
that would be step one in creating a
dictatorship convince the public
that they're all they're all idiots
unless they follow the science
and and other people can mock you
your fellow citizens can mock you if you
don't follow the science you've got to
follow the science that's step one
and you say to yourself what's wrong
with that scott
of course we want to follow the science
yeah you do you do want to follow the
science
but who interprets the science who tells
you what the science was
well it's not you
because you didn't see any science
personally you're waiting for somebody
to tell you what the science is
so step two
is to control the narrative
around what science says
so does science say
that electric cars are the future
does science say that climate change
will kill us all
what does science say
well
unfortunately science doesn't have a
voice per se it has to be interpreted
by the news business by your government
in some cases
so the second point is to control the
narrative
so let's say that the party in power
had a good working relationship with the
dominant news organizations
the news organizations could tell the
public that they have to follow the
science and then they could tell them
what the science says
now we're into the dangerous part
because if they tell you the science is
x you act one way if they tell you it's
why you act the other way but are you
following the science
or are you just doing what the people
who interpreted the science and put a
narrative on it told you as a science
so you could very easily think you're
following science and the next thing you
know you're in effectively a
dictatorship
because you don't know what the science
is you don't have access to it you only
know what the government told you the
science was and if you don't follow it
well you're going to be ostracized and
you know your reputation will be
destroyed and you're just a science
denier and who's going to hire a person
like that
so that's the thing to worry worry about
is who controls the narrative around
what the science officially says
have you noticed that on twitter there's
a pinned um
it's in that trending area on the
browser at least
and it's about the arizona audit
and it notes that
a lot of experts or republicans are
having doubts i think they're saying a
lot of people are having doubts about
the
audit now why is that
on the trending side just pinned there
every day i wake up lately
and there it is
that the arizona audit is sketchy
basically
now
is that
the top news every day
because it feels to me like it's
actually a smallish part of the news
unless they find something right it's
the smallest part of the news
but it's prominent on twitter
because it's propaganda right putting
that there and leaving it there to say
that people are worried about how
sketchy it is whatever language they use
that that's just propaganda
it's very transparent
right
so that's you know somebody controlling
the narrative there
but uh there is a story coming out of it
and the story goes like this and before
i tell you the story about the audit
i'm going to give you some general
advice
anything you hear about the arizona
audit
is probably false
probably
now that doesn't mean it's all false
but anything you hear early
the earliest you hear it
the more likely it's all right
now eventually we might have something
approaching knowledge because let's say
they find some things if they find
something obviously that would open it
up to other people reviewing it more
experts you know democrats looking at it
giving their opinion et cetera if we go
through all of those experts
and there's still some substance there
then i'm going to say whoa pay attention
to that looks like looks like the
experts couldn't even debunk it
but in the beginning
the odds of any of these stories being
real
is just really low i mean pretty close
to zero
so today's pretty close to zero's story
is that the maricopa county uh
deleted a directory full of election
databases
from the very election that they're
auditing
days before they have to give the
equipment to the audit
now if that's true
it's pretty bad
right that they deleted the the database
before handing it over to audit
so what's that sound like to you
put on your bs detector
all
of you
and
tell me in the comments
what
what flags you see in this do you say
you see any flags on this story
all right let's see if you can get this
here's the here's the red flag
it's a little bit too on the nose
what if i told you about that
if you see a story that's too neat
um
yeah
it's if you see a story that's just too
exactly what you would want the story to
be
wouldn't you let's say you're a
republican or a trump supporter
wouldn't you just love
to hear that somebody got caught
red-handed deleting a database
and then you look at it
and there's a reason it was deleted
because that's where all the the bad
stuff was hidden
okay the odds of that
perfect story
being true
i'm going to say pretty low
pretty low but it could be
right and
i saw online you know the question was
asked
if uh if it's true how could you explain
it with anything else
how could you explain it other than bad
intentions
to which i say that's never the first
assumption
the first assumption if data is erased
is incompetence
and i'm imagining a typical bureaucracy
and it goes like this
hey we're the audit people and we have
court approval to have access to your
your machines
so deliver us our machines by next week
and they talk to somebody who's in
management who controls the machines
the person in control of the machines
says to an underling hey we have to turn
over these machines by tuesday
the underling assigns it to yet another
underling
who now is three layers away from what
was requested and says we've been
requested to deliver these machines
to this entity by tuesday
the final person who gets the final
instructions
might not even know why
might only know that they have to
deliver some machines
and so you could imagine and i'm not
saying this happened i'm just saying
imagine a bureaucracy at work
you can imagine the person doing the
actual work
saying to themselves well what's our
process
oh our internal process is that you
never take a machine out of storage
and move it anywhere until you've
deleted its data
and so the guy doing the work says
what's my process oh i've been asked to
deliver this machine to another place
and our process is always delete the
data before you move the machine
now i'm not saying that's the process
i'm not saying anything like that
happened i'm just saying if your first
assumption
is bad intentions
i think your first assumption has to be
bureaucracy and stupidity and
incompetence
or even that the story isn't true that
nothing was deleted
your that's your first assumption
now if you've worked through all the
possibilities that stupidity was or was
not there
maybe you're left with bad intentions
but you got to start with just
stupidity
now the the other question is whether
anything that was erased from these
machines is erased in a
bleach bit way where you can never
recover it or is it simply deleted in a
way that forensic people can just
recover it
because they still have the hard drives
i understand so we don't know anything
about this story yet i wouldn't assume
any of it's true
i would assume it's not true actually at
this stage
um
all right
so um liz cheney of course lost her uh
committee assignments or whatever
and she's gonna make it her life's
mission to take down trump
but let me tell you the last thing you
want to do if you want to take down
trump
what would be the worst way to do that
if you were thinking to yourself let's
see
we're going to take down trump so he
can't run for president again what will
we do what will we do what will be our
strongest play
why don't we take somebody who's wildly
unpopular
and have her become the face of the
resistance against trump yes that's a
good plan
let me give you some
advice about trying to take out trump
never give him an attractive target
because that's what happened
suddenly
liz janey just became the jim acosta of
congress
you know she became the fake news of
congress
there's nothing trump likes more
than an unpleasant enemy
i mean i don't know if he could like
that anymore
so if you want to power trump up
give him an unattractive enemy
and here i'm not talking about
physically unattractive but
as a candidate or as a politician
i'm going to read to you later some of
uh
i'll do it now let's get ahead
so trump now has you know just a website
and he puts out these press releases and
they turn out to be basically just super
tweets
so i'm going to read you uh trump's
funniest insults from his new
new process of putting out his
statements all the time
uh so i'm just gonna pick a few so
here's the liz cheney one
liz cheney is a bitter horrible human
being i watched her yesterday and
realized how bad she is for the
republican party she has no personality
or anything good having to do with
politics or our country she is a talking
point for democrats whether that means
the border the gas lines inflation are
destroying our economy she is a war
monger whose family stupidly pushed us
into the never-ending middle east
disaster
draining our wealth and depleting our
great military the worst decision in our
country's history i look forward to soon
watching her as a paid contributor on
cnn or as he calls it msn and msdnc
now
here's the first thing i have to say
about this
trump is really underrated as a writer
just as a writer
this first sentence liz janey is a
bitter horrible human being
that's like a perfect first sentence
short to the point you know exactly
where he's going and then he fills it
out
you could work
as a writer for a hundred years and
never write a sentence
as good as this first sentence liz
cheney is a bitter horrible human being
could you imagine yourself not reading
the second sentence
seriously
who in the world could read that first
sentence and then say oh i get it and
then walk away
you can't
you can't read that sentence and not
continue reading that's what a first
sentence is supposed to be
let's do another one
i see that everybody is comparing joe
biden to jimmy carter
okay aren't you in
that's his first sentence
could you walk away from that
you can't you can't walk away from that
first sentence
i see that everybody is comparing joe
biden to jimmy carter you know this is
going to be good
whatever comes after that sentence
if it's coming from trump
you know you're going to be entertained
don't you
well here's the entertainment
[Laughter]
he says it would seem to me it would
seem to me that is very unfair to jimmy
carter
okay it begins
jimmy mishandled crisis after crisis but
biden has created crisis after crisis oh
money shot money shot
first there was the the biden border
crisis that he refuses to call a crisis
then the biden economic crisis then the
binding israel crisis and now the biden
gas crisis
joe biden has had the worst start of any
president in the united states history
and again he he makes a statement like
that so you have to fact check it it's
like okay was he the worst
or was he the second worst
well we better look into whether he was
the worst or was he just the top three
worst
classic trump
and someday
they will compare future disasters to
the biden administration but no jimmy
was better
now
don't you miss him
i mean seriously
he's the only person who knows how to
really bring
like humor and interest to politics
uh then here's another one he goes
a guy named miles taylor
who i have no idea who he is don't
remember ever meeting him or having a
conversation with
gets more publicity
pretending he had
i'm sorry i can't talk for a minute hold
on
um
uh he gets more publicity pretending he
was in the inner circle of our
administration when he was definitely
not
some people refer to him as quote
absolutely nothing
and he goes on so he refers to this guy
as quote
absolutely nothing oh god okay
allergies problems this morning sorry
all right
um i heard that nigel
farage
confirmed on his podcast that trump lost
weight
um
i feel like this is actually
an important story
that trump lost weight
because he looks great
and especially you know if he's thinking
about running again
you know how how vital and healthy he
looks
i think it matters
it matters a lot
and so it looks like he's controlling
something he can control
all right let's talk about this
cdc guidance on masks so the cdc is
getting some pushback because their mask
guidance is too complicated and even you
know trevor noah is mocking them so even
the left and the right are mocking so
basically
they're saying
go ahead and do outdoor things if you're
if you're vaccinated so let me see if i
can help them
let me see if i can simplify their own
advice
if you're outdoors you don't need a mask
if you're vaccinated
so far simple right
the exception would be if you're going
to be close to somebody for a while
that's it
that that's the whole outdoor part
so do you think they should hire me to
do their messaging
because they've got this like you know
if this if that under these conditions
when to wear a mask when it's dangerous
i just told you the whole thing
don't wear a mask outdoors if you're
vaccinated
unless you're going to spend some time
really close to somebody
that's it that's outdoors now let's do
indoors
now their guidance is you should still
wear a mask indoors
um
if you're around you know anybody you're
not hanging around with all the time
such as your family
and that's also kind of simple right
wear a mask indoors if you're not with
your familiar people
but
i'm going to suggest
that the public as i said this before i
think the public just needs to make
their own guidelines
and then tell the government what they
are
because if enough if enough of us do it
it just becomes you know the de facto
standard
and i would say that by july 4th you
know and of course i would update this
as data suggests you know if anything
changes but i think by july 4th
uh vaccinated people should just go
massless
and the only exception would be if
they're going to be in close contact or
in a room for a long time
with somebody who's
got an obvious comorbidity you know
they're in a certain age or they're not
too healthy or something
and
i feel like we should just do that july
4th
independence day yeah and no masks for
kids as you say
now if you're if your kid
has a weight problem or something or
some other health problem maybe that's
different
all right um
and they're also the cdc is also trying
to figure out
uh how dangerous it is if you're fully
vaccinated if you can still transmit the
virus asymptomatically
now on one hand i fully approve
that they're looking for that data
because i'd like to know that data
on the other hand
don't we already know
i mean we don't we don't know
no in 100 uncertainty way
we don't know that vaccinated fully
vaccinated people
are a very low risk for transmitting
but we know it
and if you look at our overall death
rate
it's plunging and it doesn't look like
it's going to stop plunging
as long as the overall death rate gets
down to about our baseline death rate
it doesn't matter what if they find out
that you can
it wouldn't change anything
because if the overall death rate has
gotten so low that's sort of comparable
to just the baseline death rate
what's the difference
i mean
it would be far more valuable to just
get back to life
as long as our death rate is back down
to normal
than it would to worry about this little
special unique little risk so i would
say the cdc is
studying something we definitely want to
know
but i don't think the decision should be
based on that it's just a little extra
so i think that's a mistake and probably
politically motivated meaning that
politicians don't like to
guess something wrong so they err on the
side of caution
rasmussen has done a poll that says that
apparently if you watch msnbc or cnn you
get gaslighted pretty hard on climate
so
54 percent of likely us voters who watch
msnbc
who say it's their favorite cable
channel
believe that
uh that basically we're doomed within
100 years from climate change
just like doomed
not
not as in it will be a challenge to
overcome it
not as in our gdp won't be as good as we
hoped
not as in
you know uh some places will be less
habitable but while other places might
be more habitable because of the change
no nothing like that um over half of
msnbc viewers think the uh
humanity is doomed in 100 years
now
could you have children
if you thought the world was doomed in a
hundred years
let's say you're a young person
would you bring a child into that world
because long before it's doomed
it's doomed ish
you know any kid you bring into the
world today will be
in that doom
area
so let's compare that
and also 53 percent of cnn viewers say
the same all right so more than half of
cnn and msnbc viewers
say that we're doomed what about fox
news viewers what do you think only 25
percent
so 25 of fox news viewers also think
that we're kind of doomed in 100 years
uh what did i tell you about 25 percent
yeah it's sort of my go-to thing every
time i talk about a poll
25 percent of people
will say any damn thing
on any poll
it doesn't matter what the question is
25 of the people will just always be on
the other side it could be the most
obvious question in the world
do you like to eat good food
25 percent of the people say no i don't
like to eat good food
not me
it's just weird you you just can't
it's really hard to penetrate 75
but now we know that uh the poor people
who watch msnbc and cnn
poor meaning unfortunate
um they are being gaslighted and they
fear for their lives and the lives of
their children and grandchildren
yeah sony says oh wow 25
yeah hannah i agree
how in the world did 25 of republicans
i assume
uh come to that conclusion but 25 will
say anything
so let's talk about that uh hacker group
dark side
so biden says
quote so far there's no evidence based
on our intelligence people that russia
is involved
although there is evidence that the the
hackers are in russia
now further evidence is this now this is
part of the reason that they think
there's that they're russian
is that they'll actually uh
they'll look at machines they're
infecting and if those machines have any
russian language settings or something
similar to that they won't attack
so in other words we do know that they
avoid attacking russian assets
but we don't have confirmation that put
that russia is involved
is that a difference that you respect
let's say for example we found out
that putin had not ordered them to do it
and they're actually a criminal
organization just doing what they do
why would they not target russia
i can think of two reasons see if you
can think of any other reasons
number one they're working for russia
but again the intelligence agencies have
not determined that to be the case but
it's possible
number two
they're not working for russia
but they are afraid of putin
do you see where i'm going
either putin is paying him in which case
he knows where they are
or
they're afraid of putin
in which case he knows where they are or
they're worried that he can find them
even if we can't
so let me pull this together
and this is how you should run your
personal life as well as politics
if putin knows where they are
and we don't know that but we know that
they're afraid
they're obviously afraid
he knows where they are
that's the same
as if putin is
is sanctioning them i mean is it's the
same as if putin is ordering to do what
they're doing if he knows where they are
if they're afraid of him
he can stop them
same level of responsibility if you're
trying to say well that's different he
didn't order it
no that's not different
we should treat it exactly the same as
if he ordered it
because if they're afraid of him
and they're in his
in his country
it's because he can find them
and if he can find them
and he's not
it's the same as if he ordered it in
terms of how we should treat them
so i think the uh i don't know if biden
has the guts to do it but i think the
pressure on russia no and of course you
have to go through the whole intel
thing you don't want to act harshly but
i have a feeling that within our
government we're talking about
something
pretty heavy
in terms of a response to russia at
least talking about it i don't know if
it'll happen
but i think this is just pure
to say that this is happening in russia
they're not attacking russian resources
and to say that that putin can't get at
them
i get that we can't get at them
maybe i mean i think we probably can but
maybe we can't
but they're they're afraid of putin and
that means something
all right
um
so one of the tricks i've told you for
persuasion and sometimes it's just for
fun is to embrace your opponent's
arguments
because when you embrace your opponent's
arguments
and they have a reflex to argue with you
no matter what
you can actually trick them into
debating against their own point
and i'll show you a couple of examples
of that
so these are some tweets i made just to
practice this technique
i said the pipeline companies should
hire the election software makers to
make some unhackable software for them
i hear they are the only ones who can do
it
so
i've embraced the argument that election
software is the only software that can't
be hacked
which is
 stupid
right
but i put it out there like i mean it
now nobody who read this probably
thought i was completely serious but
wouldn't you expect
uh a lot of critics to push back on this
i i haven't looked at the comments in
the last hour or so but
i think the critics just got really
quiet
that's how you know you uh
you penetrated
the you know how much the critics love
to pile on anything i say right yeah
anybody with a blue check if they say
anything about politics the critics just
flow in and eat them alive
well the critics got really really quiet
because in order for them to criticize
me they would have to argue that
election software cannot be made
unhackable
which would open up the possibility
that maybe we should audit them to see
if they had been
so it's an unapproachable argument
here's another one
breaking i said in a tweet
no court has found any evidence that the
colonial pipeline was hacked
therefore it wasn't
see what i'm doing here
so did the critics come in and say hey
you can't say that just because the
court which is really the wrong
entity anyway just because they didn't
find any evidence of it
that just means they're the wrong people
and they didn't even look for it that
doesn't mean there's no evidence
well that of course is
the whole argument about saying that the
few courts who looked into some few
specific things
didn't find anything but they're also
not the ones looking for it
so if people who are not looking for
something don't find it
so how much pushback did i get on that
surprisingly not little
or surprisingly little which actually is
not a surprise so there's your technique
embrace
your
the most idiotic arguments on the other
side and then challenge the critics to
debate their own to debate their own
point
and then just watch
uh elon musk interestingly suspended uh
the acceptance of bitcoin for teslas
because creating bitcoin
uses so much electricity
that it's apparently it's a
a climate disaster
just what bitcoin itself is creating an
electrical
needs so
i saw the cryptos were down this morning
i don't know if they'll stay down
um i'm not going to suggest that this is
a buying opportunity for a bitcoin
but i would certainly be worried if the
people who care about the climate decide
that they don't like it so that's
that's going to be interesting to watch
who saw that coming yeah a lot of people
saw that coming
uh yeah elon musk has the power to crash
a crypto and it looks like he's done it
at least twice
scott please wear your blue t-shirt it
looks best you mean this one
um
every once in a while i i feel i need to
tell my audience that when i buy
t-shirts
if i find one i like i get a bunch of
them the same kind so if you see me
wearing this shirt a whole bunch of
times
it's actually multiple shirts i just
just thought you should know that
uh so 75 of bitcoin uses renewable
energy well that doesn't matter because
that renewable energy could be used
somewhere else
um yeah the dark shirts look better on
tv that's true on my face anyway
uh can you do a show in drag
would you believe that's the first time
i've ever been asked
i'm going to tell you something that
i don't know if i've said this publicly
i might have so
tell me if you've ever seen this
but some 20 years ago or so when i was
already beginning to contemplate
how i would retire someday in the far
future
i had a plan for retirement
which
would uh
change dilbert forever
and the in the the plan was that
the way you'll know i'm going to retire
because i might not announce it before
it happens
the way you would know is if dilbert
becomes transgender
so 20 years ago that was my plan
is i was just going to make dilbert uh
transgender and then just stop and just
leave it there
because in the cartoon world when you
make any kind of a change people expect
it to you know go back to where it was
because everything always has to go back
to where it was and i thought
the most provocative thing i could do is
just make him transgender like
legitimately
and then just walk away
so but um in in the 20 years that has
passed
the the politics of
transgender everything has changed to
the point where i believe it would be
considered um just disrespectful or
something so i'm
uh i'm probably not going to go that way
because it doesn't have the same
uh it's lost all of its uniqueness which
is what would have made it fun
and now transgender is just sort of our
daily topic so it doesn't it just
doesn't have that
that uniqueness to it that i was looking
for
uh
it might be considered very brave well i
don't know i don't know how brave it
would be
how do we know he isn't good point
nobody would sell bitcoin to buy a tesla
[Music]
uh don't wear a white shirt yeah you're
right
somebody says colonial paid the 5
million ransom did they
i don't know if that's confirmed and i
don't know if it would make any
difference i don't know if it would work
but as i've said before
the u.s government should have been
telling the the public that they have
intel and they're closing in on this
on the hackers
the hackers should have been feeling
that they were going to die within 24
hours
and if they didn't feel that
even if it wasn't true you know they
should have been convinced that
that some military agency is is going to
put a drone on them any minute because
that's how you negotiate you don't
negotiate saying we don't know where you
are
uh there's no way we could ever find you
so i guess we'll just pay this amount
that's not very good negotiating
they should have been under the
immediate threat of of death within
minutes
you want them thinking about their death
within minutes
then you negotiate
all right
that is just about all i have to talk
about today and i will talk to you
tomorrow
