congratulations and welcome to another
amazing amazing day
did you know that if i tell you you're
going to have a good day it actually
makes it better no it's true
if i simply tell you today will be a
good day it will bias you
and your confirmation bias will kick in
and so
as the official hypnotist
of live streaming
i'm going to snap my fingers and tell
you to have a good day today
have a good day
watch how many people
are going to have a better day today
it's amazing now suppose
you'd like to take it up a level and
you'd like to really enjoy the day
really dig in really get some traction
all you need is a copper mug or glass
attacker chelsea's time to canteen
georgia flash a vessel of any gun
fill with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's the dopamine the end of
the day everybody's talking about it
it's a simultaneous sip and it's going
to make all of you sexier smarter and
more capable go
hold on hold on everybody hold on
uh ben isn't ready
everybody
we're all in this together
i just got an emergency message on
youtube from ben
i wasn't quite prepared
everybody hold on ben
ben are you ready
i think he's ready
go
all right now if you didn't make it that
time ben
it it just wasn't it just wasn't there
for you
well
did anybody uh join me last night in the
man cave
i did an unscheduled live stream in the
man cave in which
i decided that my thing is going to be
telling you stories
because it turns out
i've accumulated a vast amount of
weird interesting stories
and so i was trying them out last night
on my locals
the local subscription platform
and um i think i think those might have
been
available to other people i can't
remember what setting i had
but that's going to be my thing i'll do
some more man cave
live streams well in
the weird uh simulation like tragedy
as you know
i've been learning to play the drums in
recent years so sort of my my main hobby
is learning to play the drums and so
part of that process and that journey
you end up following
great drummers because you want to see
how the great ones do it
and so i feel like
every time i find a great drummer
something bad happens to him
so
i started out you know looking at ginger
baker from the old group the cream
but but he's dead so i was like oh
wouldn't it be cool to
follow somebody who's alive and so i was
looking at neil pert
and uh he died
and then i started getting interested in
the drummer for the foo fighters taylor
hawkins
he died last night at age 50.
i don't think any of this is my fault
john bonham
deceased yeah so basically ringo starr
is all we have left at this point
charlie watts exactly charlie charlie
watts was literally
who i was copying when he died
i was actually playing his videos like
oh he's got
he had a simpler
style that was designed for being
danceable so that was charlie watt it
just has to be danceable everything else
doesn't matter
so
how weird is this
every time i love a drummer they die now
the story is
that he was about to is a few hours of
going on stage in columbia i believe
and he was age 50.
he looked perfectly healthy i mean if
you looked at him he looked
i didn't look 50
first of all
did you know he was 50 he looked 40. so
he didn't look like he was going to die
at all
but he died at age 50 and no cause of
death was given
no cause of death
he's in
colombia he's 50.
it's before a rock concert
he'd be
maybe preparing for the rock concert
you know i really feel like
when they don't tell you the cause of
death you kind of know the cause of
death don't you i mean i don't want to i
don't want to throw this guy into the
bus because i actually respected him
quite a bit
as a performer so i like them a lot so i
don't want to make up some crappy rumors
about the guy that not sure we'll we'll
wait to see what happens
so i don't want to
predict
oh yes i do
yes i do
it's probably drugs and probably
fentanyl
now
what's it going to take
what's it going to take now i'm not
going to assume that i'm right there so
so if it turns out there's not fentanyl
i i have an apology to give
and i will definitely be giving it
all right so if tomorrow you find out
he had a heart problem or something i
will be apologizing profusely
but i am concerned
that this looks obviously oh stuart
copeland is still alive you're right
this looks exactly like what it looks
like
and i hope it isn't i really hope it
isn't
but if it is
we might be closer to taking it
seriously
well is there any story that starts with
the three words a florida man that is
not entertaining
uh i should do a survey on that have you
ever seen a story
that started with the three words a
florida man
and then you found yourself saying well
that's not going to be interesting
well here's the story today i think it
was in cnn
a florida man
has died after crashing his car into an
11-foot alligator
um
and then they reported that both the the
driver and the alligator were deceased
i kind of wonder why there are not more
alligator fatalities
you know the only times i've been in
florida
i feel like i always see an alligator by
the road
am i wrong
if you're driving around in florida
don't you
you always see alligators by the road
how in the world are there not
continuous
vehicle deaths
based on
alligators i know i the thing that
surprised me is that we don't hear it
every day
well here's a story about bill maher's
bubble
here's something that he said bill maher
said on the show friday i guess
he said i think that today's republicans
uh would not do that i think that they
would be thrilled to have no black seats
on the court talking about the supreme
court
and then he clarified you know okay
maybe maybe a few
uh well you know he said uh okay a lot
of them so he wasn't saying every single
republican
um
but i would like to add the following
to his bubble
here's something that bill maher really
really doesn't understand
and i want to i want to see if you all
understand it
or disagree with me you know you're free
to disagree
i'm going to tell you a story of two
people talking
and how it goes
and you tell me this is i'm just making
this up but you tell me this isn't how
it goes
there's a white conservative guy
gets into conversation with a black man
and he doesn't know if the black guy is
conservative or what
and maybe they get into a little
disagreement about something and then
the black guy says well i just want to
clarify
i'm a conservative
and the white guy says what oh odds were
against that
and then the guy said yeah i'm totally
conservative churchgoing love my
constitution
i think everybody should earn their own
way and race should not be part of any
decisions in this country
and then what does the white guy say
he's a white conservative
does he say to in his mind does he say
you know but yeah you do agree with me
on all the things that i find most dear
but you know you're still black
so is that what happens
is that what happens
does the white guy the white
conservative the republicans say oh you
know you do agree with me and all the
important stuff
but you know you're still black so
so
no
i i don't think in the history of the
world that's ever happened let me tell
you how that goes
oh you probably don't know but i'm
actually a conservative
and then the white conservative says
what
yeah right down the line constitution
bible family
whole deal
and then the white conservative says
ah
are you free for lunch
let's do lunch
you know that's the way it goes
right why does bill maher not know that
am i right
i'm literally right
if
if the conservative finds somebody who
agrees with the philosophy
they're 100
okay
not 99
not 99
they're a hundred percent
okay
no exception
that's my opinion and i've never seen an
exception to it
now i tell you often that i'm not
conservative because i'm not
but i definitely appreciate
that about conservatives
there is a consistency there that's
impressive
right
that it's that consistency
that draws me to conservatives and
republicans
you know they
i'm not going to be the guy who tells
you that the republicans don't have a
lot of conspiracy theories running
around in their brains because they do
they do so does so does everybody just
different ones
so it's not about that it's not about
the conservatives are always right and
you know
the democrats are always wrong i don't
really see that
what i see is a group that has a
consistent workable system
that they respect
and they're they're quite consistent
about it
i love that
i love that
even when it gives me a result that's
not exactly my preference but i love
this system and i love i love the people
who buy into that system it's not like i
dislike the other people but
there's much to respect
about people who take seriously their
own philosophy
and i do think conservatives take
seriously their own philosophy
all right um i've been telling you for a
while that i think movies are a dead art
form for a variety of reasons the
biggest one is that our attention spans
have declined
watching a two or three hour movie just
sounds like torture to me
i can't imagine how anybody does it
anymore
but beyond that the movies themselves
are complete crap
there must have been a time
in our world where we were not exposed
to so much ugliness
that we could watch it for entertainment
and i don't know if this is what
happened to me it feels like it
maybe happened to you too
i suppose in my childhood
i just was not exposed to as many
negative things maybe because no
internet or whatever
tv was all you know sanitized
so if i went to a movie and the movie
showed some like horrible thing
happening to somebody
it would be so
out of the usual and of the normal for
my experience i'd be interested in it
even if it's horrible
because unfortunately that's the way
brains work
but now we live in a world in which we
are inundated with real-world
disaster scenarios
we're all going to die from the bio labs
and the inflation and the food shortages
and russia's going to attack and it's a
nuclear war and everything
and my capacity to handle ugliness
is always
completely full
so that any extra bit of ugliness that's
added it just makes me flip out
right
yeah
everybody's the same there there's a
limit you can take and then there's over
the limit
and to me
paying money
to go across town let's say you're
watching it in person
and sit in an uncomfortable seat and
watch three hours of something that is
designed to make you feel uncomfortable
it's made that way
that's not an accident that's the
feature
the feature of a movie is to make you
feel really bad
so that when the end of the movie comes
they can relieve that it's like an itch
and a scratch
so first they make you itch really badly
and then if you can sit through all
three hours they'll give you a little
scratch and that's your payoff
who does that
why
why would you go to a movie
it makes no sense
that because you have uh infinite
alternative
entertainment on the internet
you can go into youtube and have
you know 50 cool short experiences that
are just what you wanted with nobody
tied to a chair to be tortured for
information
by the way there's a standard that i use
that i would i would recommend to all of
you it might make movies better it goes
like this
as soon as the movie involves somebody
tied to a chair
turn it off
turn it off
that's it that because as soon as you
see somebody tied to a chair you know
this isn't a good movie
this is a movie designed to make you
feel bad
and then you got suckered into going to
it yeah
right as soon as you see the chair
even before they're tied to it you know
they're going to get tied to the chair
turn it off there's nothing good there
here's another little tip for watching
uh
comedies
if you want to know whether a comedy
let's say a sitcom on tv is worth
watching to the end
see how long it takes them to make a
food joke
now this is real insider humorist stuff
here
bad writers make food jokes do you know
why
because when they're writing
they're eating
and a bad writer does this
blank page
what am i right about
eating my donut
got to come up with an idea
hey
what about something about food
now
it is impossible to make a funny food
joke
i actually write about this very thing
you can do jokes about people
and about how people feel and maybe you
could do a joke about how somebody feels
about food but you can't really make a
joke about the food
and if you see somebody making a food
joke
like
love those doughnuts
and jim gaffigan
jim kafkin's jokes are really about
himself
so that's a little bit of a trick
yeah jim gaffigan can do hot pocket
jokes
because it's not really about the food
you know it's it's about his reaction to
food that's the only thing that makes it
funny
uh so if you see jokes that are about
the food and not the person's response
to the food that's a bad writer turn it
off
all right i tweeted this and then i
caused a accidental controversy uh
here's my
tweet no no system can survive the
addition of one person to the situation
no personal system for success
can survive adding one person to the
process
and a lot of people said oh you're
you're publicly complaining about your
divorce no it's not about that it's
actually literally just about systems
so it's not about me personally
it's something i've been noticing i'll
give you here's a specific example
now if you think this example is unique
and
maybe an example of the exception
the whole point is that this happens
over and over and over again
so what sounds like an exception trust
me you can generalize this
a lot
so i have a system
of rewarding myself for work
so i don't mind the work as much just
like a dog if i do my work i get a treat
now the treat that i give myself is a
a raisin bagel
with coffee in the morning
it's just about my favorite thing to do
to have a nice bagel you know you have
to wait for it in the toaster it's
piping hot
and there's something about the process
of making it this kind of pleasant and
all this i treat as a reward
so it's been it's working for uh years
and years and years
my my reward
now
um i improved my system
by in the morning i would order fresh
bagels every three days or so because
you can you know eat them for a few days
before they get stale
so about every three days i'll order
fresh bagels in the morning and they get
delivered to the door
and
a member of my household i'm going to
speak very generically now just for
privacy purposes but i have several
members of my household
and one member of the household said
hey bagels
can you get me some
blueberry bagels because i really like
blueberry bagels
not really like any other kind but
really like the blueberry bagels
and so
i took my system
of ordering
raisin bagels
on a regular basis which are awesome
and i added to that the blueberry bagels
so they come in the same order
now here's what i didn't count on
a blueberry bagel and a raisin bagel
look exactly the same
to idiots
in this case i would be the idiot
now i know what you're saying uh scott i
could pretty much easily tell the
difference between a blueberry bagel and
a raisin bagel you just have to sniff
them
to which i say i do not have
a sense of smell
i have to rely on visual
visually they look about the same until
you cut them open and then you realize
you got the wrong one now they come in a
big box they're all mixed up
so every morning
my system which used to be treated as a
reward
where i just oh i love that raisin bagel
has now been transformed by the addition
of one extra person into the situation
now
every morning i go and i look at the bag
of bagels and i say to myself
god damn it i'm not gonna be
able to know which one is the right
bagel i'm gonna waste my time
toasting this bagel i'm gonna be done
with it i'm gonna put it in my mouth and
i'm gonna say once again
i picked the wrong bagel
and so
my beautiful system of rewarding myself
has turned into a bagel hellscape
in which i have not yet figured out a
way to emerge
i was thinking i could do two orders of
bagels
one of just raisin and one of just
blueberry
but it literally doubles my work
i don't want to double my work
that's not a good system yeah two orders
nope uh
now i could ask them of course it's
doordash i could ask them to put them in
separate bags but they won't
if you've ever tried to make a special
request to doordash they don't really
read those
as far as i can tell they don't read
them
so i don't really know what to do
now
is this the biggest problem in the world
no this is the ultimate you know rich
person's problem
however
watch how well that generalizes let me
give you another example
i created a system where i downstairs i
had a
one drawer
in the kitchen there was just for things
that i always had to go upstairs to get
so i kept putting anything important in
that drawer one of the things i put in
there was my wallet
because i was always running upstairs to
get it if i needed to leave the house or
my keys you know that sort of stuff
so
my ex-wife at the time
said
don't keep a wallet down there
somebody might get at it now of course i
had made that conscious decision
that there was a little extra risk but
the convenience was worth it but when
somebody else tells you not to do it
you're like ah
yeah i'm gonna have to get to this
conversation again so
i was like okay that's i'll move the
wallet
but it'll still be my drawer of
everything else
well
about that point my ex-wife decided that
that was the good junk drawer
and so my
well-positioned drawer of only the
things that were clearly visible
became a pile of garbage that i had to
pile through every time i wanted
anything
and it was the stuff i wanted most often
so
take those two examples and if you're
tempted to say scott that's just about
the those two people
i mean
that's not everybody you can't you can't
add just everybody to a system and it
breaks
no i'm saying everybody i'm saying it
has nothing to do with the personalities
of people involved it is a general rule
that as soon as you add one person
to your system it'll break
so look for ways to avoid adding anybody
to your system and just be aware the
moment you let that other person in with
their little preferences
and they start getting in your head your
whole system is gone
so just remember that when you're
building your systems
uh rasmussen says 66 percent of the
public thinks the hunter laptop story is
important uh scott did a poll in his
head and found out that zero percent
people will base their vote
on hunter's laptop
i don't think anybody's gonna vote on
that do you
they should
i mean it feels like it's pretty darn
important
but
i don't think anybody will
because the republicans were all going
to you know vote republican and the
democrats were going to vote democrats
so i'm not sure that's telling to say
that
um we have a further confirmation today
in a more
meaningful publication so it's
the uk is daily bail you can
you can insert your own comments about
the credibility of the media and that
one in particular
but uh it is reporting a lot of details
about a ukrainian bio lab that was
funded in part by
hunter biden's
hunter biden's efforts so he was part of
an investment group
and he did get some investments for at
least one bio lab
that was involved in stuff that at least
could have been weaponized
don't know exactly what they were doing
now i saw the funniest tweet
from a twitter user called nothing
that's his handle nothing
he goes uh i'm genuinely a little bit
upset he's talking to me he says i'm
genuinely a little bit upset that you
guessed the hunter biden bio lab thing
he's he's genuinely upset that i made
that prediction that it was it was
correct in 48 hours
now is anybody else
is anybody else impressed that i made
that prediction
that hunter biden would be tied to the
bio labs
thank you
you should be impressed by that
you know there aren't that many things i
do
that even i think you should be
impressed by but that one you should be
impressed by
i mean that was
that that was a
frozen rope a home run over the center
field fence i mean there's no way around
that one
now
as i replied to my critics who were
wondering how the hell i guessed that
was it a gas or did i have inside
information i will tell you i didn't
have any inside information
so on this particular topic sometimes i
do
some
i have to admit sometimes my predictions
are based on a little bit of inside
information not always sometimes
this one had no inside information the
technique i used i explained to you
ahead of time
somebody says scott pretends to make
predictions based on insider information
did you write that before i just said
that or after
but let me clarify
i rarely make predictions based on
insider
information is that different than what
you is that different than what you
think
i think i rarely do it now i don't
always tell you because the source of
the inside information might be you know
private
but
uh rarely rarely but sometimes i don't
always have inside information
all right
uh now the part that would make this uh
amazing and really a movie is if we
found out the coronavirus came out of
the hunter biden funded biolab now i
don't think that's going to happen
but it would be the perfect movie ending
wouldn't it
so the the technique i used to predict
this is that reality will follow a movie
script path
we're uh
there's a christino video
don't know about that
um
so there's a uh
by the way
let me ask you something
if you see anything about me
that you think you need to send to my ex
don't do it
if you see anything about her in the
media or anything else and you think
well he's got to know about that just
don't do it just do me a favor just
don't do it just just stay out of it
everything's fine just stay out of it
all right
uh
mushrooms are coming
um
there's a weird thing happening so a
number of republicans and democrats
around the country
in about a dozen states
are pushing legislation to
legalize some form of
psychedelic mushrooms now the context
usually is medical
or always i think and it has to do with
experimentation and maybe some treatment
and so what they're doing is different
but here's the amazing thing
it's bipartisan
there doesn't seem to be
like an obvious difference about whether
this is a republican or
democrat thing
and
you know the thinking is that it might
be going the same path as marijuana
legalization
but
i don't think that's the interesting
part of the story i do believe
that
psychedelic mushrooms are guaranteed
to become legal and
are routinely used in a medical context
that's that's my belief actually i'll
make that a prediction it's it's barely
a prediction because it's just so
obvious
i don't think anybody disagrees do they
does anybody would disagree
i don't think so i think that's just
obvious at this point so maybe some
others yeah maybe some other
psychedelics as well but mushrooms for
sure i will tell you that in the last
few weeks
number of people who i would call uh
normies
you know people that you would not
associate with like
advanced drug use
i think at least three normies
have said something about wanting to do
mushrooms
and apparently there's some chocolate
bars
and i don't know if they're legal or
illegal but there's there's like a
now there's a well-made product
that puts the mushrooms into chocolate
squares and i hate to tell you this but
it was the the main thing that was
keeping mushrooms from growing in terms
of the public
is dosage
if you get a bag of actual mushrooms
you don't know how much to take
and that for me that's a that's a full
stop
right if you if you don't know what
quantity to take
full stop
and there's no way i'm going to play
with something i don't know the quantity
especially if a small quantity could
have now i don't think i've never even
heard of anybody having a bad mushroom
experience it must happen like one
assumes it does happen never heard of it
so i don't i don't know how dangerous it
is if i've never heard of one example
but
so mushrooms are coming and there's
nothing to stop it however
that's not the big story
um
i just got an anonymous text from
somebody who's saying the chocolate
squares are amazing so
mushrooms have moved into the mainstream
you know that right so ordinary people
you just don't associate with this or
just say yeah these i'm going to get
some mushrooms and mushrooms are great
now the medicinal the medicinal value
is almost incalculable
mushrooms have been reported
to be curing everything from
uh
everything from addiction to different
mental health illnesses anxiety all
kinds of stuff and it's because they all
have the same root
do you believe that
the the reason that uh mushrooms
and psychedelics
are reported to you know i'm not the
doctor so i'm not going to tell you
what's true or not but reportedly have
these you know miracle cures
against all kinds of different seemingly
different conditions like is addiction
really the same thing as
anxiety or
some other mental illness not really
but it seems to fix all of them do you
know why
tell me why
why why do mushrooms seem to work
against a bunch of different things
somebody says trauma equals and
that's interesting
trauma equals inflammation
i wouldn't bet against that
that
i haven't heard that hypothesis but i
like it
all right let me uh there we go
yeah
yeah mushrooms dissolve your ego
it's like rebooting your whole mentality
it allows you to reframe your your
existence so you basically do demo on
your entire thought process
and then uh by eliminating your ego
because you in a way your ego is what
keeps all of your existing thoughts
intact even when they're stupid
your ego is the part to say well
you think i'm wrong but i'm not wrong
because the ego is protecting yourself
is the thing that makes you not able to
change your opinion even when the
evidence says you should
so if you get rid of your ego
what happens to your confirmation bias
it goes away
because it's your ego protecting your
you know your reputation your feelings
and stuff that's the only reason the
confirmation bias works
because you're trying to protect
yourself
if you take away the protecting yourself
no confirmation by us
imagine seeing the world for the first
time
without bias
now it's impossible to describe
what people experience under any kind of
hallucinogenic state
there aren't any words in the
non-hallucinogenic state that capture
that and the way you can transmit it
all i'm going to say is that um it
doesn't surprise me that if you can
eliminate your ego long enough to
reprogram your your frames
that when you come back online after the
after the mushrooms
and again let me say this
to avoid demonetization i i'm very much
against anybody using any kind of drug
that's not doctor recommended and doctor
supervised
so you know don't go wild and just shove
magic mushrooms in your mouth
be a little smart okay
all right
the supreme court ruled that biden is
the commander-in-chief
you know i thought that was like a joke
uh headline
was it politico had that headline
and then i read the article oh yeah
actually that headline does capture it
so the supreme court was
ruling on whether biden can order the
troops to get vaccinated
or because it's maybe unconstitutional
the commander-in-chief could not
tell people to get mandatory vaccines
but the court ruled that the
commander-in-chief can pretty much tell
the troops to do anything because
he or she is the commander-in-chief
that's why
and
i feel i agree with that
you know you you could say that there's
some kind of evil going on with forcing
anybody to get a uh
shot
but i don't think we treat the military
like any other part of society
am i wrong that the military
can uh expressly
discriminate
they can can't they
can can't the military discriminate
they can
that's the only it's the only part of
society well that's not true but it's
one part of society that is explicitly
allowed to to
discriminate
now they can't discriminate against race
do you know why
because race apparently doesn't affect
your fighting capability
makes sense
right there just wouldn't be any reason
now if there was a reason
that would be dicey
if it turned out there was some reason
that race made a difference in your
fighting they would discriminate
they would
because that's their job
but as it turns out
it's probably not a factor
so
they can discriminate against your
height
am i right you could be too small you
could be too old
too disabled so the the military is all
about discriminating and when it comes
to the trans question
i think they only care about cost and
readiness
and otherwise that's your problem
so we do allow the
military to discriminate and the supreme
court has backed them in that ability
this discrimination is a weird kind
because it's about the vaccinations
all right
um
fact checkers on twitter were going wild
today and they were fact checking as
false
a claim that vaccines were hurting
people more than they were helping them
so they say the fact checkers say this
is not me this is the fact checkers and
uh can we pause for a moment
give you a little context
if you look at something like
factcheck.org
one of the ways you can know that
they're right about everything
is that fact is right in their name
fact check
so therefore logically it follows that
100 of the things they say are facts
and so when i read this fact check you
should definitely believe the fact jack
do not believe the alleged fake fact
don't believe that
oh wait a minute
okay all right um i did some mushrooms
and now i'm thinking more clearly
it does turn out that the fact checks
are exactly as non-credible as any
conspiracy theory
now i'm not going to back the conspiracy
theory in the specific case
but
it is sadly true
that the fact checkers do not have more
credibility than the conspiracy theory
they can be right i'm not saying they're
wrong
they don't have credibility certainly
not on this and let me tell you why they
don't have credibility
so first here's the story so there's a
bogus claim by some doctors group that's
organized doctors group to
basically say contrarian things about
the pandemic
you've probably seen them
and
they say that the there's a misleading
graphic to show
that the deaths rose even though the
vaccinations were rolled out
so the the graph purported to show that
there was no difference in the deaths
and they kept going up after
vaccinations roll down
uh the fact check says they made this
mistake
they confuse cumulative with daily
what
who does that
apparently the entire
graph
only it only tells the story that these
doctors wanted to tell because they
confused cumulative deaths which by the
way
you do know that cumulative cumulative
deaths
always go up right
they never really turned down
you can't add anything to anything and
get less of it
doesn't work
and so the doctors who are have i ever
mentioned this
have i ever mentioned that doctors
while they might be excellent at
doctoring
do not necessarily have skills at data
analysis
exhibit a
if you can't tell the difference between
cumulative and daily
well maybe you shouldn't talk in public
about data
but
and then the fact checkers pointed to
two studies more recent studies
that showed that the vaccines totally
worked and that
saved america
um and so you can believe the fact check
because they pointed to two studies
and if it's in the study
am i right
it's in the study
well it's got to be true
it's got to be true if it's in a study
no
no
what about two studies
there are two studies that say that it
works
so you believe that
two studies
no
no
no i happen to think it's probably true
that the vaccines worked
and i would place a fairly large bet on
that actually
but we can't tell there is no
way that you and i know if the vaccines
worked or not because we only get
the only data is on reliable data that's
all we have we have only unreliable data
so i have my bias my bias is that the
vaccine probably worked do you think
that i'm biased by the fact that i got
vaccinated
do you think my belief
that vaccines maybe were safer than some
people thought do you think that is any
way influenced by the fact that i got
vaccinated
yes
yes
if i've taught you nothing you should
know that
a course i'm biased now
does it help
that i'm completely aware of the source
of the bias
a little bit
but not much right
if people could see past their bias
because they understood where it was
coming from
well we'd be in pretty good shape
but apparently people can't do that and
why would i think i can
if i observe that it just doesn't seem
to be something that human beings can do
why would i think i can do it
now it feels like i can do it
but it feels like you can do it too
doesn't it and i'm not so sure you can
do it so the fact that it feels like you
know i can come up with good unbiased
opinions means nothing
i definitely feel like i can if you ask
me scott like really deep down in your
bones do you think you could overcome
these bias i'd say with a completely
straight face
i'd say
you know
i really think i can
unlike everybody else in the world
i really think i can and i step back and
i hear myself
and i think okay listen to yourself
listen to yourself now listen to
everybody else on earth
who you know can't do that yeah they all
think they can
so
that that's that's the only way you can
get to anything like humility
is to understand that you're claiming a
superpower that everybody on earth
claims and nobody has
nobody has it
the ability to be unbiased
so factor that in when you look at my
claims now here's the payoff
there's nothing interesting in knowing
that the fact checkers say something you
don't think is true
but
here's
the trick
are you ready
was this the only data and the only
graph and the only group
staying saying that vaccinations might
have been more dangerous than we've been
told
only one
no but nobody else out there
did anybody else have different
arguments
but they came to a similar conclusion
why is it that the fact check orgs just
had multiple orgasms on this one
specific
claim
why is that
because i'm seeing stuff by other people
online i won't name names
that seem far more
compelling
than this one would have
but i don't hear anybody fact check him
do you
have you now seem completely different
claims
the vaccines might have a problem i
don't know if they're true
and i'm not saying that they are
in fact i bet against them i don't i
don't think they're true but i don't
know i don't know and you don't know
either
so why is it that they picked this one
to debunk
you if you don't know this
i will be disappointed
because you've been watching me for a
while why'd they pick this one to debunk
it's a diversion
they pick the weakest one to debunk
because they can't debunk the strong one
if they debunk the weakest one they can
say we've debunked the idea that
vaccinations are dangerous
just look at it there's my fact check we
just debunked it totally debunked
but why did they debunk
the weakest most obviously wrong one
that had no value at all
when there are stronger claims that also
might be false but they appear to be
more substantive
this is propaganda this is this is
brainwashing
and again i'm not saying that
vaccinations are dangerous because i
think
if i had to bat i'd bet that
that the
that the risk balance was appropriate
don't know
could be totally wrong because i'm
biased
you don't need to tell me i'm biased i
know that
all right
um but if you see a fact checker going
after the weakest argument you should
say you a fact checker you are
trying to manipulate me by going after
the weakest argument go after the strong
one
do you know how i tell you that if
you're trying to debunk the list
persuasion somebody comes at you with a
list of 10 reasons why something's true
if they've got 10 reasons why
something's true the only way you should
attack that is say give me your one best
reason
would you agree if i can debunk your one
best reason you'll go rethink the others
that's all you could do that's the best
you can do
well uh here's a question do you think
russia will run out of generals
before ukraine runs out of bullets
because it seems like every day or so
we're hearing about another russian
general
got killed by the ukrainians
how many of you believe that is true
well i'm gonna agree with uh
twitter user
uh hope i wrote down
his name
maybe i'll find it later
but uh i think that after the war is
over we're going to find out that maybe
some of those generals are alive what do
you think
i think maybe some of those generals
might be alive maybe more than we think
all right there was speaking of russian
generals there was a russian general who
was talking about uh what they were
trying to accomplish what russia is
trying to accomplish
and it feels like he was moving the goal
post a little bit
so here's what the russian general says
they're trying to accomplish in his own
words
the combat potential of the armed forces
of ukraine has been significantly
reduced allowing us i emphasize again
to focus the main efforts on achieving
the main goal the liberation of don bass
and and the other region there i forget
his name
so
it seems that a russian general speaking
in public presumably
not off page
is saying that the reason they're there
is to
uh basically degrade the ukrainian
military and to liberate don bess
now
backwards mission creep right you see
what's forming here right this is the
exodus strategy
so putin is putting in play an option if
he
if it turns out he can't conquer the
whole country which one assumes would be
the preferred
thing but he's creating an option
to say these were our goals even if they
weren't
and here's how we accomplished them even
if we didn't and now we can get out
right so you can see the end game now
the end game is really clear
the end game is that putin will create a
situation in which he can definitely
claim victory
uh here's my opinion as of today
russia won
in my opinion the war is basically over
i mean this still needs to run out but
here's what i think
i don't think we were trying to win this
war
because that's not what winning a war
looks like am i right
when i say we i mean the western people
backing the ukrainians we weren't trying
to win this war
we weren't
because i don't think we wanted to
because when we want to do some
something and we have the ability to do
it well don't we do it
am i right if we have the ability to do
something and we want to do it
we do it
so here we have the ability to do far
more damage
and we didn't do it that looks like a
choice
it looks like a choice to simply
destroy ukraine and destroy russia
for maybe
decades
to get an advantage over them so that
they couldn't fund their military and
wouldn't sell their energy
against us and
so i think both sides are going to get
what they want weirdly
in a way
here's what putin's going to get
complete victory
it looks at this point if he survives
and it looks like he will that putin
just won i think he just won
straight up because he can tell his
people he won
he did get things he didn't have before
now what he loses
is
maybe international reputation
and then sanctions
but let me tell you if the sanctions
last 10 years
but their productive control of ukraine
lasts a hundred
putin is going to look like one of the
best leaders russia ever had
am i wrong about that
all he has to do is serve on his time
you know and keep the
history books saying what he wants them
to say
and he's going to say we got rid of the
russians or i'm sorry we got rid of the
nazis
we
repatriated the russian-speaking lands
we built a land bridge and we
neutralized the ukrainian threat
and we kept nato out
i think he ran the table
am i right
he ran the table he got everything
because i don't know that he really
cared about cave i mean kiev is
irrelevant
if you own the parts you want you've got
everything you need and you can come
back if you need to and blah blah
so putin himself won't starve his
country might go through some tough
times i think they will but so will
everybody else
i mean we're heading toward a
potential global food shortage
and i think we're going to work our way
around that i think we'll be okay on the
food but
um
i think russia is going to go through a
tough 10 or 20 years
and then in a hundred years putin will
look like a hero one of the great
builders of the nation
and he will win and it will never have
that much effect on his personal life
because he'll go to his dacha and have
us
have his harem and whatever else he's
doing
um
so
looks like he looks like you won
um
what else has happened
oh it's uh gregory mackel's on
twitter
uh
this is his tweet i'm agreeing with this
he said my money is that most of those
generals will pop up alive after the war
and after many people who follow edgy
russian sources oh and only the people
who follow edgy russian sources will
know about it
i wouldn't bet against that
now i you know if one general died well
i'd believe that or maybe two or three
i'd believe that i mean anything could
happen but seven rate generals
no
here's another fake news there's a story
that a
russian commander has died after being
run over by a tank by his own mutinous
troops
so that was in the news today
do you believe that
it comes from a ukrainian journalist
one source
a ukrainian journalist
believes that he witnessed it or
or he was close to the scene so he found
out about it
that uh the mutinous troops ran over
their own commander
with a tank
now
how fast does a tank go
and how fast can a russian general get
out of the way
are you buying russian tank red over
general
yeah now somebody says it could be an
accident
how many people in a war zone during a
hot war
how many people die
by
mutinous murder
versus accidents and
acts of war
if you had to put a bet on this one
somebody says 30 or 40 miles an hour but
very loud
i'm guessing you can see it coming
yeah i wouldn't stand in front of it
that's for sure
uh a tank goes faster than a person can
run
but does a tank
turn faster than a then a person could
just walk out of the way
if you saw a tank coming at you at 30 or
400 miles an hour
and remember it's not going to be at top
speed because it's
you
could you get out of the way
can tanks
can tanks go sideways too easily
somebody says they're surprisingly agile
but at that speed
uh have you looked up operation gladio
yet no should i
uh all right i'm gonna call this fake
news because it's a little bit too on
the nose you know when you predict hey i
think ukraine is going to do some
propaganda like this and then some
propaganda like this comes out right
right when you expect it because this is
right when you expect
the mutinous russian soldier stories now
i did get credit
um i think andre's back house gave me
credit for uh and he said if big
question is if it's true
then i predicted it but i don't think
it's true so i'm not going to take
credit for that because i don't think
it's true
and that ladies and gentlemen brings us
to the end of possibly the best
livestream that has ever
happened in the history of civilization
civilization and
uh
try ordering your bagels in separate
boxes that would double my work
i know how to fix it if i double my work
trust me
i easily know how to fix it by doubling
my work i'm trying to avoid that
um
oh my god zielinski being recognized by
the oscars is a strike against validity
yup
it is
uh
get a girl to sniff my bagels oh yeah
maybe i can get a bagel sniffing uh
service animal
not a woman
but maybe like a
like a i don't know squirrel or
something you don't really need a whole
dog for that job
i guess some kind of a
ferret or something like that ferrets
there we go
putin won by ignoring biden
maybe
now who do you think owns uh mario poll
so the ukrainian sis the ukrainian city
has been demolished by russia who do you
think owns mariapol
the news tells you that ukraine still
owns it
i'm not so sure about that
who owns rubble
if you surrounded the rubble do you own
it or if you live in the rubble do you
own it who owns the rubble
the people living in it and starving or
the people who have surrounded it with a
massive military
oh that's a bad pun
marry a rubble
it's clever
too soon too soon
um
yeah
i know so i don't think any of the news
coming out of ukraine it should be
believed i think you've got that story
by now
and
how do we do today
was it
amazing
it was yeah best ever i think
probably
the highlight of your day
and now
uh i'll be turning off
youtube
i'm glad you enjoyed the perfect audio
experience
and now
go enjoy the rest of your day
