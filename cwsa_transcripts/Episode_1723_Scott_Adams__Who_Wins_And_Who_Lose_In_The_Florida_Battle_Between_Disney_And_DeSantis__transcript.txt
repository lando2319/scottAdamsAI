don't you look good today
i like that color on you
you know i've noticed
that you look good in almost anything
you wear it's it's weird i don't know
how you do it
and you're funny you're smart
i could not love you more all right
that's probably the best thing you're
going to hear from anybody today
this is something i learned from the
dale carnegie class
that
complements work
even if you believe they're insincere
they still work because your brain is
just
like a machine you put in the input
gives you a certain output and you don't
really have to believe the input
weirdly that's why movies work
you can watch you can watch a movie
and feel emotions even though it's not
real
compliments work just like that hey that
compliment isn't real
feels good feels good why does it feel
just like a real one
because it doesn't matter if it's real
your brain processes it just like it's
real
within you know within limits you have
to be able to convince yourself that
it's real ish
but would you like to take this
experience up a level
hard to believe i know
but you can all you need is a cup or a
mug or a glass of tanker jealous is that
a canteen jug or flask a vessel of what
kind
that's right any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now
for the
unparalleled
pleasure
it's called the simultaneous sip
best thing that's ever happened to you
today go
oh i've just been welcomed to someone
else's simulation
what if our dreams are the real world
and this is the simulation whoa
whoa okay that wasn't very deep
but we're going deep
so
uh this this disney and desantis thing
is way more interesting
than it should be
meaning that i started out thinking it
was sort of a thin story that there
wasn't much to it
but there's really a lot of interesting
elements to it
and i don't know they're fully
appreciated so let's talk about that
so uh just an update if you don't know
disney years ago in the 60s
negotiated a deal with the state of
florida where they would have some
autonomy
in a certain uh part of the the state
that they owned so it was their own
property and they could put in uh
their own
city services you know water sewage
roads
stuff like that
as well as other powers but that's
mainly what they wanted to do was take
care of the infrastructure and
i guess they got tax breaks or no taxes
or something like that and in return
they they built
the disney properties
and the state would benefit from the
people coming in and having a big
business where there had been nothing
but
you know unused land before
and then disney would benefit from the
you know the efficiency in the tax
breaks
and that was a good idea until disney
opened his mouth about the uh
poorly labeled don't say gay law that
really wasn't about that was more about
not having
having teachers
teach little kids
things about sexuality
and um or even even things about gender
identity stuff like that so that was the
basic idea
so then
governor desantis um retaliated and
we'll talk about whether that word
really fits i don't think it does
he retaliated so to speak
by revoking um
disney's
special deal
and
and what and it was just because disney
spoke up about the law
now
all right that's the setup just so
everybody's up to speed
here are the things that people have
been saying about it
one is that
it's disney had an unfair deal
because they weren't paying taxes
unlike other corporations they weren't
paying taxes
and so why is that good for florida
if florida is giving up some you know
autonomy
and they're not getting taxes
it's a bad deal for florida right
no
no there's a reason that florida made
the deal
no i don't i don't own disney stock
except that it's a component of an index
fund good question
by the way you should always ask that
question if you see me mention any
product
or even a ceo
ask it just remind me because i don't i
just don't remember to do it because
there are some of these companies that
that i have some stock in and i do think
it influences me even when i don't feel
it of course it does money always does
but i don't have any specific
stake in disney
so
um
[Music]
here's the thing
disney employs 60 000 people in florida
so that's 60 000 employees who get a
paycheck
and then what happens with their
paycheck
money comes out of it that's called
taxes and it goes to florida
now that's 60 000 people who
either wouldn't be there to work or
would have had
we're competing with other jobs would
have been higher unemployment
it would have been something different
but 60 000 employees is quite a few
people
how about the tourists
all those tourists who come into florida
they're paying hotel taxes
right so a hotel tax is almost like an
income tax on somebody who doesn't live
there
it's just sort of an indirect
income tax so florida actually has a way
to to
in a conceptual way
to levy because it's a it's a
destination state
everybody wants to go there
for vacation anyway
they can essentially put an income tax
on other states
because if you make some money in
another state and you want to spend it
in florida on a vacation
some of that money is going to go into
the hotel tax and go into florida's
pocket
so how how how many millions of people
go to disney every year
and they're filling florida's coffers
through the hotel tax
and then all these people are eating and
drinking and buying goods and
uh there's this ripple effect
the the size of
the footprint of disney's you know
economic benefit to florida
is kind of enormous isn't it am i wrong
if you're talking to actual commercial
successful economist
would they say if you said to an
economist disney doesn't pay taxes in
florida
would they just laugh at you
i'm pretty sure that disney
creates more taxable situations
which is different
they create more taxable situations than
anybody
in florida i don't know who's the
biggest employer in florida
besides the government outside the
government who's the biggest
and maybe schools outside of government
and schools
is it disney
no military could be military but that
doesn't count
well disney's one of them
somebody says nasa
i would think disney's the bigger one in
terms of tax impact
so
now that's not counting the fact that
disney built their own infrastructure
so instead of the
[Music]
town paying for roads disney paid for
them isn't that like a tax
is it's in place of a tax which was the
whole idea
we won't you know you won't have lot a
lot of taxes
but
those taxes would have paid for the
roads but you're going to pay for the
roads
so just like attacks
you just have more flexibility to put
the roads where you want them
and who knew better where to put them
i mean disney knew where to put the
roads and what kind and when they needed
them and it was their priority so
wouldn't you prefer disney build the
roads
to make it exactly what they wanted and
built for the customers impact
all right
um
so he says you're really trying hard
scott you know when somebody says that
like i know i know i've
sort of made some inroads
look for how many generic
criticisms i get on this topic
watch how generic there
and that'll be that'll be a topic coming
up
all right so
the first thing i would say is that the
reason that florida made the deal with
disney is not because disney was so
clever
that they put one over on
florida
that didn't happen
i mean there's no evidence that that
happened
the evidence is that
two sophisticated entities
disney
and the government of florida
got together and they said all right
what's good for you what's good for us
how do we make a deal that's good for
all of us
and by the way when you decide how long
a deal lasts
you know if you if you decide it's sort
of a forever deal
that's part of your initial calculation
right if it's a bad deal
what happens well in in my view a deal
is deal so that's a bigger factor for me
than it is for some of you and i'll talk
about that in a minute
um so let me start with that it's easier
i'm going to go to the whiteboard so
would you would you agree that some of
you have different opinions than i do
about the disney desantis thing right
starting with the fact that we have
different opinions of it
but why
is it because of the logic
or some knowledge
probably not
i think i think how you command on this
has to do with
your priorities
in other words
there are a lot of things in play
so some people have sort of an
anti-corporate power
bias
you know it's just sort of it's a filter
they see the world in and so they say
hey why should disney have a special
deal
maybe that's a high priority for you
it wouldn't be for me
but i could see why that would be for
somebody else
parental rights now of course this is
the central
the central issue right the parental
rights
so i would say that for many of you
this is the number one thing
and whatever it is whatever it is that
gets to support that
even if it's a little extreme even if
it's breaking a deal
it's just the most important thing
so you might say to yourself you know
i could be kind of flexible about
everything everything
if i if i can get this one thing
i just want to have parental rights
about how to raise my kid
reasonable
but and i don't have any pushback on
that any anybody who has that opinion
i'd say
it's a good opinion
um some people say that it's about
winning you know it's more important to
win other people say it's deterrence by
the way
uh i was debating
the word retaliation
and i said that if retaliation is what
you're doing
like
just retaliation
you should be impeached
because we don't you don't hire people
to retaliate
that's not really the job
but here's what i realized
here's what i realized
um
the comments are going crazy because you
want me to use the word grooming
to make you that'll make you happy yes
if if you believe that the issue is
grooming i'm putting that under parental
rights
right
so i i acknowledge
that the issue is that
people thought that their kids were
getting groomed
but that's all that all comes into the
category of you want control of what
your kids hear right i mean
wouldn't you do you agree that's the
catch-all for that
somebody says i'm wrong where am i wrong
uh issue is disney lying
okay
so there are other issues people say
disneyland i would say that if you use
the word deterrence
instead of retaliation then i'll agree
with you
watch this
watch us all agree
you probably didn't think i would that
we we could find a way to agree but
watch this
if i asked you to replace the word
retaliation
with the word deterrence
the desantis
pushed back in what you could call an
unrelated area
to create a deterrence
for not only disney but anybody else who
would get into this realm
and maybe interfere with parental rights
or be
you know promoting grooming or whatever
it is you think is happening
did that work right
as soon as i said deterrence you all
said okay that's what i was thinking
right
but it was it was just retaliation that
wasn't working for me as a word
and so i think we were not i think we
were not disagreeing
on the concept
i think we only disagreed on the word
and so i would i would blame the
journalists
uh well no i blame myself
allow me to take responsibility for my
own opinions i blame myself
for being let's say a little bit duped
by the journalists calling it
retaliation now keep in mind that the
word retaliation was used on both sides
right cnn and fox news
have both used that term
so it wasn't like i was biased by one
side
i was biased by both sides
and the way the journalists chose to
treat it
but it's but as long as you say the the
purpose of it was to
set up a precedent
and say look if you mess with parents
or you mess with politics in a way that
the people on the right don't like
there will be consequences
you won't like them and they'll be
fairly immediate
and that that would that would form a
counterbalance
to the fact that the left is really good
at
getting pressure on corporations
so corporations already have pressure
from the left
they have had far less pressure from the
right
desantis is creating the first
uh let's say memorable counter balance
because keep in mind from a persuasion
perspective it doesn't mind that he's it
doesn't matter so much that he's doing
it
it matters that you remember it
it's the remembering it that's the
important part
that's right you can do stuff all day
long but if people don't remember you
did it it will have no future effect
so if you're looking for a deterrence
you're looking for a future effect
you got to remember it
and as
desantis pulled that off
would you say that census has succeeded
at least for the people who pay
attention to politics i'm not sure
everybody's paying attention to this
this is probably like a 10 at tops
but wouldn't you say that he succeeded
totally right the people who have any
kind of political memory
will always go back to this example
and the very next time a corporation
speaks out everybody's going to say whoa
you better pull that back
because you saw what happened to disney
you saw what desantis did to them
so
i would agree this works as a deterrence
and i would also agree with the people
who are saying that
the right had not yet established a you
know mutually assured destruction that
would keep the
keep the corporations on the sideline
and if you think that that's a good
thing
and many of you do and that's a
reasonable opinion right
if you if your politics aligns with the
right
and you think the right has been bullied
and pushed around
and you see desantis as
essentially
you know landing a blow for your side
but also creating a deterrence
then i accept that as
as a trade-off that makes sense
but let me tell you where you and i are
probably different
and it's not in the logic of it and it
has nothing to do with
you know i don't have a different
opinion about parental rights
i'm pretty sure we i think probably all
of you watching for the most part
have a very similar opinion you know the
parents have to be in charge
you know as much as is practical they
need to be in charge
but here's where you and i differ
i haven't
perhaps irrational
if i if i were to look at my own
thinking
perhaps irrational
um but it's there
i keeping a deal is a big deal to me
it's a big deal and here's why
i'll give you the rationality but maybe
there's some irrational thing that's
driving me for this
it's the only thing that holds society
together
the reason the united states works
relative to say some country that the
government never works
is that in the united states you have a
reasonable expectation
of people keeping their deal
and if not
and if not
then yeah there's some consequences
yeah i was always impressed that china
as much as i criticized them i always
was impressed that they just waited for
the 99-year lease in in hong kong to run
out
because clearly they could have forced
the issue earlier right clearly but
they just
they kept to the deal
and what about the uk
right they owned this thing for a
hundred years
had you know this great value
and they said
um deals a deal
so
i always appreciated that because that
every time you have a big example of
somebody keeping a deal even when it's
really not cool for them it's just
really hard for them but they kept the
deal
that's what keeps everything together
like it's the most
basic glue of society
is that you keep your deal
so
does that apply to this special case
i think a reasonable person could say
scott i get what you're saying that
that's important to keep your deals and
that that's the glue that holds america
together and really makes us special
i would say because our court system
will chase you if you don't keep a deal
we do have that working
more or less better than other countries
but if you said this is a special case
i would say oh you got me
because i'm always willing to treat
anything like a special case i'm never
the person who says there's no special
cases
there's always a special case and would
this be one
if you're going to pick a special case
of all the reasons you could pick a
special case
this special case would be if you think
you're protecting your children
right isn't that the ultimate special
case
well a deal's a deal
normally normally i would not be in
favor of somebody grooming my child
but a deal's a deal and i don't want to
go back on a deal
because it's a very important principle
it holds society together
no
you're going to break any deal
if you think your child's well-being is
at stake right
you'd break it immediately
so
i think i have some irrational
irrational connection to this
for this topic
so if you and i disagree and you want to
say scott you're being irrational
uh here's where i'm being irrational in
the deal's a deal that really bothered
me
i have to say
strangely enough it really bothered me
that that anybody would
now let me say it another way
it bothered me that the government would
break a deal
that bothered me the most
now
if you say hey the deal was made when it
made sense but now time has gone by
and disney is doing so well that you
know they don't need that special deal
okay
but i don't know if anybody did the
analysis
did did desantis do the analysis and
know that they really make money on this
deal
does the state of florida really cabana
head
because they're going to be paying for
the infrastructure now instead of disney
do they i don't know did anybody do that
math
all right well here are some of the
answers that i got when i ask people be
specific
what do you think desantis got in terms
of the benefit
and here are the things that people
answered and i want to show you how
sort of muddy people's thinking is
everybody who said he created a
deterrence
i think is a clean thinker
that's a clean answer you could disagree
with it you could say i don't think it
was enough of a deterrence or something
like that but it's a clean
specific answer
that that's a benefit
everybody would understand what that
means
and it can be explained in one word
deterrence so that's like a good good
answer
here are the other answers
so these are people who maybe
are feeling something about the issue
but the thinking process hasn't
gelled yet
people said that the benefit that
desantis got was it's a principle you
know he's upholding a principle he said
obedience
keeps disney out of politics
but does it
i don't i don't know will it keep
anybody out of politics because remember
the left is pushing people to be in
politics
so
corporations are going to be damned as
they do and damned if they don't
i don't know it won't keep anybody out
of politics but it might actually be a
little deterrence
disney loses its monopoly power i don't
even know what that means something
about losing their special control some
people were
um
pointed out that disney should lose that
deal anyway
so it you know it doesn't matter that
it's being used as a deterrence
should lose it anyway
um there's things like fairness and
attention and blah blah blah so
um i think the bottom line is that we we
probably are closer to agreeing on this
than that
fox news asked some people about biden's
accomplishments
before we do this
let me tell you something i wasn't sure
if i was going to talk about today at
least in this forum
so last night
i decided that i would see if i could
recreate an experience
that i had in my twenties
and it was an experience with mushrooms
and
i've talked about it often and i said it
was one of the most well first of all is
one of the most enjoyable days of my
whole life not i mean just off the
charts
but secondly i said that i felt it
changed me permanently
in a positive way
and i wasn't sure if i were to do it
again many years later
if i would feel the same
because i thought to myself what if what
if the benefits of this the first
experience
sort of settled in and just became who i
am
would i then be immune
in other words
would the experience just try to make me
what i already was and i would just sit
there saying i don't think anything's
happening
or
would i just have another profound
experience i had no idea
so
first of all kids
don't do drugs
so you're going to get a cautionary tale
here
if you think this is going to end
with a delightful delightful story of
how much fun i had
well it didn't go that way
did not go that way
here's what i think happened
but i'm not positive
um
the specific forum was in chocolate
right it was an edible
and it was sort of packaged and you know
professional looking thing and i thought
well that's going to be safe
because i knew people who had
experienced exactly the same product
from the same box literally
and
you have nobody had a especially bad
experience i think one mildly bad ones
but but basically so i knew this was a
relatively safe kind of thing relative
to things that are not safe it's not a
safe
let me be clear it's not safe
it's just
a little bit safer than it could have
been you know if you just found a
mushroom in the forest and started
chomping on it i guess that would be the
least safe
and so
you're contradicting yourself all the
time now what would be an example of
that
all right um
so here was my experience
i had no cognitive
um let's say
psychedelic experience
i
i took
the low end of the highest dose
and i felt physically uncomfortable
like i couldn't sit down
and i didn't want to be touched
you know it just i just needed to be
standing and walking
and
a stomach ache
like a digestive problem that was
actually pretty bad
um
so he says the dose was too low
uh
well if the dose had been higher
wouldn't have
no i didn't have an empty stomach
so i intentionally ate eight beforehand
like right beforehand
so here's the thing
if you think that i had a mushroom
experience i disagree
because having experienced it once
i can tell you that
this wasn't it
so i don't believe this was actually
actually mushrooms
i think that and i did a little googling
to find out sure enough
there are counterfeit
there are counterfeit mushroom chocolate
products now i don't know if i had one
but i do know that i know what it should
have felt like
and it wasn't
it wasn't like a small version of that
there was nothing
so there wasn't any psychological effect
except that i was uncomfortable i was
uncomfortable with my physical feeling
which i guess had a mental effect but
there wasn't any cognitive change it
just made me
unbalanced
and it felt like a stimulant actually
if i had to guess
i would say a stimulant
uh and i don't think mushrooms ever act
like that are they
uh no i wouldn't do that alone
so you know i was i was in a safe
environment blah blah blah
yeah so
uh did they have any memories from the
old types yeah i have a very specific
memory of the first time and i could
tell you that was dramatic
the the the experience
is not um subtle
so here's my only warning
the the toughest thing with
anything in this category is you don't
know what you're getting
that's the problem
yeah if somebody said fentanyl and i
actually that's one of my suspicions
i i have a suspicion
that it was
something that would make you feel like
you wanted to do it again yeah i'm
actually wondering
if the only people who would do it twice
are people would never experience the
real thing
because if you experience the real thing
i don't think you would do this again
but if you hadn't you might say to
yourself oh i got
some basically intoxication was out i
would i would describe it as
intoxication
and stimulation at the same time it was
a bad combo
somebody says the dose was too low
well
that that's the problem is you don't
know what the dose should be i mean if
you follow the directions
it was on the high end
but i i did expect i didn't expect it to
be like some
some effect there really wasn't any um
anyway
um fox news asked about biden's
accomplishments
and so if i act a little uh loopy today
i've got like two hours of sleep
so i'm probably gonna go to sleep as
soon as this is done
um people ask about biden's
accomplishments and it's funny because
if you see the professional
democrats answer the question what is
biden done
usually they go to infrastructure oh he
got the infrastructure bill passed
but the
the public at large doesn't even know
what that is
so biden's biggest accomplishment is
something that literally
95 of his base
doesn't know about it's just he passed
the budget it just sounds like he passed
a budget
like it literally sounds like the most
nothing that anything could sound like
hey
he passed a budget for infrastructure
okay
don't they all do that
doesn't every government
pass a budget for infrastructure
no this is like extra
that's it it's a little extra big on the
budget for the infrastructure which is
basically your normal job that's it
and even people don't know that
so
people say stuff like uh well
you know easily we brought back the uh
calm sober leadership
and
what'd that get you
how's that calm sober leadership
working out
um and but the funniest thing is there's
i saw fox news mocking a washington post
uh editorial in which the writer was
saying they couldn't understand
why biden uh
isn't being more popular and successful
and i'm thinking
i have a few ideas i can throw into the
mix
i don't feel like it's that complicated
at all
honestly all right
this old johnny depp story with uh
so he's suing a 50 million lawsuit
against amber heard his ex
because she wrote some article that
claimed he was an
abuser and now he's suing and has seems
to have proven with audio tapes anyway
that she was the abuser
so not only was she the abuser
but um
but she accused him of being the abuser
and ruined his life basically in his
career
and here's the thing that i love about
this
there are a lot of people learning
that amber heard exists
and that she has a certain set of
personality traits
and i believe that there are people well
let me ask you
how many people are familiar with the
the johnny depp amber heard story and
you said to yourself
oh my god i know amber heard might be a
male amber herd or a female amber heard
you know so gender doesn't matter but
is there anybody who
look at the comments
so many of you
have met her
or one like her
and here's the thing that you probably
thought
it can't be two of those
right
how many of you had that experience and
just said to yourself there's no way
there are two of these
like i don't know what i experienced
here
but i can tell you one thing
there can't be two of these
there are a lot of them if you look at
the comments it's just filled with
people saying yes my ex my blah blah
blah now it's men and women right so
it's not a gender thing
it's
it's a personality thing
this is if you look at the specific
things that amber heard is accused of
and since i'm not a doctor
i cannot give you a diagnosis
i will simply make an observation
if you were to make a list of all the
things that describe a
vulnerable narcissist and i think there
are some other things like
some personality disorders that also
overlap but if you just made a list of
all the things they do
amber heard checks off all the lists
and one of the weirdest ones is that
projection thing
where they blame you even in public in
this case of doing the crime that only
they were doing
that's the weirdest part
believing you of a crime that
only they are doing
like that one you don't think could
happen with more than one person
but it does
so
here's the thing you need to know
amber heard
is genetically a human being
you know if you checked your dna it
would be human
but if you treat her like a human
and assume that she will act like a
human
she will destroy you
one of the things that johnny depp said
that just really blew my mind was um
he said that something like he thought
that she'd been put there to
take take everything from him
like like she was just an evil force
who wasn't being like selfishly evil
but rather just evil
it didn't it was like she didn't have
anything to gain
it was just evil and so i think that's
what he was responding to is like i
don't even see what was in it for like
it just looked evil
and
if you've had experience with one person
like this in your life and so many if
you have i can see in the comments
just know that you're that wasn't one
now do you know what the solution is
that the experts say if you run into one
of these
one of these people
i'm just going to say one of these
people and again i'm not going to label
it
as vulnerable narcissism as if i could
diagnose it because you need a doctor to
diagnose
i'm just going to say that is there's a
very clear checklist of behaviors and
that she hits them all
right down the list boop
and that's all i can say if you if you
meet somebody who fits the checklist
and what would the checklist be it would
be like the emotional outburst the
here's here's the most incredible part
is that they'll minimize their awfulness
like it's no big deal
when you hear her on the audio tapes
like she was throwing things and
basically physically abusing him he was
literally hiding
and she treated it like he was a huge
 and it was no big deal and he
should man up
that's like you almost can't even
believe it it's like unbelievable but
that's on the checklist
right that
you know that you'd expect that one the
uh you know the having affairs the
um the projection
it's just all there
so some this seemed like a small story
but i think it's a big story here's the
thing you need to learn
the experts give you one recommendation
if you accidentally get into a
relationship with such a person
do you know through do you know what
that one piece of advice is and it's all
the same
no expert there's nobody who disagrees
wrong right because they
if you imagine that they're like people
they are humans
but if you if you imagine they act like
a person
then you'll just be destroyed
because they're not there to act like a
person they're there to destroy you
and it once you get destroyed
they'll move to the next person and
destroy them
they don't stop destroying
they just keep destroying
so
just run
and so
uh i think johnny depp
has done a national service of
extraordinary value if
if we come to see it this way
if we can see what he's telling us
he's teaching us to run
he's telling us what to look for
and he's saying run
if you see it i mean that's how i
interpret the story now of course he's
probably has you know a gigantic
personal stake in this he's trying to
you know
suing for 50 million dollars doesn't
make any sense because i don't think she
has 50 million dollars
um
but
i feel like he's he's
it feels more like he's doing it for us
doesn't it
i'm not even sure
i'm not even sure that johnny depp
thinks he'll get anything personally out
of this
except
the satisfaction of you know the truth i
guess
all right
um
speaking of the truth
uh so truth social now is on the rumble
cloud i guess and people are being
brought on on greater numbers so some of
the technical problems seem to be
perhaps resolved
but i saw
i'm seeing some activism now
to ask the apple store the app store to
drop the app
which basically puts you in a business
you know i mean you could still have the
platform but if you don't have the apple
app
you're you're not going to thrive
so
how do you succeed when apple can just
say
okay
you're gone
and what would it take it wouldn't take
anything all they'd have to do is say um
looks like you got a bunch of right-wing
extremists on there uh you're done
right
and won't there be a lot of right-wing
extremists on there
i i would think
you know
probably some
so it seems to me that
apple has every ability to just delete
them
whenever they want so
how exactly do you succeed that way i
mean i guess you don't know until you
have the fight and so that's that's the
risk of an entrepreneur is you got to
take that fight
but that's a pretty big risk
now here's my um
here's my take on trump running for
2024.
number one i think he could win
and probably would be the um
yeah i think he could win
so
and i think that if he gets in he'd
probably win
but here's the problem
given that january 6 was such a black
eye to the republicans
and a trump administration would be
looking to staff up with republicans
how can he possibly staff up
like how could a trump 2024 victory
how can he attract a talent pool
when he's suffering under that january 6
brainwashing thing that was really
effective
you know half of the country
thinks that he's a traitor
and even if he wins because you know he
gets enough votes from his own people
the
um
i i feel like
people would be afraid to associate
because it would feel like oh another
one joins the traitors party or
something
i mean it was bad enough when he was
only being called a racist
which by the way stopped happening have
you noticed that
as soon as they had this new thing
trump stopped being a racist it just
hasn't come up
it doesn't matter anymore i guess
you know as if it were ever true in any
in any meaningful way
um
he needs to make a point of destroying
the fbi well i i think that this is the
the kill shot
uh
you have to ask yourself how he would
staff up and to me i don't know the
answer to it do you
can can you think of how he could
accomplish that
or do you think people would just say oh
it's a good job i'll take it because
that didn't happen the first term
the first term there were a lot of
people who didn't want
you know a job in that administration
it feels like it would be twice as hard
in the second term because even if even
if there were a lot of people who agreed
with trump so they were willing to work
with him
even though same people don't agree with
him about january 6 in most cases
well you're always going to get somebody
to apply i'm not i'm not saying that
there wouldn't be any applicants i'm
saying that you're not going to get the
the top cream of the crop that's a
problem isn't it
now what about desantis
descent is good
right because desantis is actually
developing a
um
almost bulletproof
really it is bulletproof i think
desantis is
as the best bulletproof
set of you know conservative policies
and actions that i've seen
and it looks pretty solid
so
um
as
much as i like a lot of what trump has
done and could do
you'd have to ask yourself
if desantis would be more of a trump
than trump
it's a fair question
so um
by the way does anybody uh disagree with
me
about the staffing thing no i get that
he'll staff up so he could staff up
somehow
i've got a little disagreement there a
lot of disagreement
yeah i mean we don't really know it's
just one of those factors
disagree no okay
all right ladies and gentlemen
uh
normally when it's a faster news day
or there's more news
i would stay on here longer
but oh we've got 45 minutes that's
pretty good
and um
you prefer schellenberger
you know maybe schellenberger will be
president someday he's got to make it uh
as governor first of california
and by the way i haven't heard anybody
who's looked at his um
his platform this is michael
shellenberger running as an independent
for governor of california
uh and what's different is he's bringing
very specific
specific plans he's written books about
it researched it so he's the most
qualified in terms of knowing how to fix
these specific problems
and i'd love to see if that model ever
catches on
like if he wins
i think think of the precedent
imagine the
president if michael schellenberger wins
first president precedent is that
you know an independent can win i mean
jesse ventura did but that was i think
that was a special case
so it's unusual i mean they can
they could do it but it's unusual
uh so it'd make that more likely that
might be good
but it would also
make the idea of uh
capable leadership based on knowing how
to get things done and you know really
researching and stuff it might make that
a thing
what if that becomes a thing wouldn't
that be good
yeah
i i want to just i saw a comment on
locals
i'm pretty sure that i did not have a
bad mushroom trip
what i had was something that probably
wasn't mushrooms
that's what i think happened so if
you're thinking that i had a bad trip i
don't think i did
i just had a bad experience with
something that probably wasn't what i
thought it was
all right
um
a rasmussen poll about uh really
or you're out you you think there should
be one
it was a deliriant
i don't know what that means exactly
all right that's all for now and i'll
head decaf
they're decaf mushrooms all right
uh we talked about elon's tweet about
bill gates yesterday
all right that's it for now i'll talk to
you tomorrow
