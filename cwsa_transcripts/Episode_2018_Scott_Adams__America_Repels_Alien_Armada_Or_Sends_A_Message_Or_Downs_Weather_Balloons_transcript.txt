Papa
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization as long
as it lasts
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
there's never been a finer moment in
your entire life
and if you'd like to take it up to I
don't know 20 000 feet
40 000 feet can I get you sixty five
thousand feet higher than a Chinese spy
balloon all you need is a cup or a bug
or a glass of tank or Chelsea style and
the canteen Joker flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing makes everything
better it's called this simultaneous
sip
happens now go
ah well there was something called the
Super Bowl yesterday how many of you
watched it
it was uh it was quite uh impressive
now I always like the Super Bowl
and I think the reason I like it is that
I know you know I know much of the
country is sort of doing the same thing
at the same time
I just love that I just love that the
country is doing the same thing at the
same time or a lot of them not everybody
so I didn't really you know care for the
game so much but it was a spectacle had
it on
eat some snacks had a good time
um
but my prediction
mechanism for determining who will win
worked once again
there was some doubt I I was doubted in
my prediction but my prediction works
like this I I look at the name of the
team and I decide
who would win
if for example a Native American
Chieftain
were to fight an eagle
because it was Kansas City Chiefs versus
Eagles who would win
a Native American Chieftain or a bird
well I think the chieftain would win now
the Eagle's pretty big they could be
pretty mean but I'm going to allow that
the chieftain has maybe a a weapon like
a club or a spear and sure enough the
chief beat the eagle exactly as I
predicted
um and
the uh spectacular thing about this the
really
I don't know inspirational thing
because the Super Bowl can be very
inspirational these are athletes who
have worked
since they were young kids their parents
you know took them to practices they
worked hard they they Rose above all the
rest to become NFL players and then
Rose above all of the NFL players to
become the two teams in the Super Bowl
who after all that work all that
concentration that sacrifice that Focus
that discipline it was decided by a bad
call by the refs
so it was a little bit anticlimatic
there
um but if you like that sort of thing it
was awesome
I don't know why you would but if you
like that it'd be awesome
the halftime entertainment was Rihanna
who looked pregnant and had admitted
that she was pregnant
apparently that's the announcement
so
here are three things I love
three things I I really I like more than
I should probably I was almost guilty
that I like them so much I love Rihanna
as an artist
she's awesome great artist I love
motherhood
motherhood
it's like apple pie who doesn't love
that I love motherhood another thing I
like is to watch women dance
suggestively I know it's kind of shallow
I'm not proud of it I'm not proud of it
I just like watching women dance sexy I
don't know I'm just born that way I
can't explain it but what I don't like
is when you combine Rihanna
pregnancy and sexy dancing
when you put those three together
I would rather have a stake driven
through my forehead
than to be subjected to watching it
but that's just me that's just me I love
Rihanna Love motherhood I love sexy
dancing women
not at the same time no not at the same
time well I have a question about Kamala
Harris
um I saw a dollar Brazil
say that
she was a big supporter Donald so down
in Brazil if you don't know is about the
most inside Insider of all Insiders
so if you want to know what Democrats
who are actually in charge
are thinking
Donna Brazil has the answer
so there's only one person you need to
look to
to know what the you know the secret
opinion within the Democrat upper
echelons is just asked out of Brazil
because she definitely knows the answer
and she says that uh
she wanted to support Chicago Harris
with her words and so the words that
Donna Brazil chose was that she is
standing in her own power
she she said it twice
she is standing in her own power
which means
nothing
nothing
what was the best thing that done in
Brazil
with all of her exceptional
communication skills which actually are
exceptional
her exceptional communication skills and
the best she could come up with for the
vice president is she is standing in her
own power twice
ah and daughter Brazil says the Harris
will either be the VP choice for Biden
or she will run us the for the
presidency
so she'll either be vice president or
president and you know that because
she's standing in her own power
instead they get her own power well good
how embarrassing
now I'm going to put out a theory which
you could call a conspiracy theory
and it is that the vice president is uh
has a substance problem
now I don't know that so I'm not going
to say oh she has a substance problem
that would be creating a rumor that um
is unsubstantiated but I'm going to play
you from her recent
recent speech about electric buses
and I just wanted you to listen to it
and you tell me that she doesn't sound
drunk now I don't know if it would be
alcohol or or anything you know maybe
it's natural but it doesn't sound
natural to me
it doesn't sound natural it sounds
inebriated
and it sounds so inebriated that I think
she should be drug tested
not a joke I'll use Joe Biden's
statement not a joke
I believe she needs to be drug tested
Now you listen to this and you tell me
that you don't think she's inebriated
the bus has Wi-Fi and even USB Outlets
next to every scene
I mean come on imagine you can charge
your phone on your way home from work
that's good stuff that's good stuff
all right she's a little bit too happy
a little bit too happy about
USB
ports on a bus
now there are lots of things to be happy
about in this world
USB ports on a bus which is not exactly
bleeding against technology
she was so happy about it it looked like
she might cry
USB connections on a bus
why am I getting a text message
FedEx package
so but let me ask you
let me ask you did she look in the seem
inebriated to you
tell me your honest opinion
saw some no's so you think that's
natural
okay
all right well I'm gonna I'm gonna call
I'm gonna call rank on you
I've probably seen more seen more
inebriated people than you have
oh let me ask you this uh all right
most of you uh stopped commenting for
just a moment all right let's just pause
commenting before I ask my next question
so my next question is only
for people who have experienced drug
addiction
somebody's experienced it themselves
does she look inebriated to you
if you've experienced your own addiction
does she seem inebriated
a lot more yeses
a lot more yeses now
now remember when I you know I would
I've said things about Hillary Clinton
being unhealthy and seemingly inebriated
and people on you know the pro-trump
side where we're demonized for even
bringing up such a suggestion
I think you can bring it up if somebody
acts High
don't you
if somebody acts inebriated in public
and they're they're an elected official
I feel like we can ask the question
and if you don't think that looks High
to you just look at all the people who
said yes
right it's not a science you can't just
look at somebody and know what's in them
but I've looked at a lot of high people
and that looked Stone to me or drunk or
something I don't know
but she does have an interesting
laughing kind of a personality and she
does love buses so it's not impossible
that that's natural
but if that's natural
I don't want any of that
I don't want that in my government if
that's natural or drunk
all right
Rasmussen did a poll on Biden's uh job
performance on Fentanyl
now
um I don't know how many times I have to
show you how smart my audience is but
without even knowing the answer because
this hasn't even been released I got I
got an early preview of it nobody knows
the answer to this but watch this
watch this what percentage of Voters say
Biden is doing a good or excellent job
on the Fentanyl
I'm seeing 25 27.
25
it's 26 percent
how do you do that
how do you do that
it's like it's like every time I ask you
a poll question you know the answer
before the like we don't even need
polling anymore you guys are so smart
very good yes 26 percent
so
all right here's a question I asked on
Twitter what would be the budget
hypothetically
for the special forces in the U.S Air
Force to take out the cartel basis of
operation what do you think that would
cost
yeah we're going to put 100 billion into
Ukraine but what do you think taking out
the cartels would cost
I'm going to put it under 20 billion
I think it's somewhere between you know
one in 20 billion but everything costs
way more than you think so like my
intuition says 5 billion
so I just you know up into 20.
because my experience says when you
think it's five it's going to be 20.
so
I think 20 billion
20 billion
do you think it'd be worth it
if we can take out the cartels or let's
say degrade them seriously for 20
billion would it be worth it I think so
I think that would be money well spent
and I I think we'd actually make money
on that because we would you know lose
fewer people and you know all the other
problems
probably
now do you know why I asked about the
budget
how many of you know what I'm doing
what's that called
what's it called when I make you think
about the budget for attacking them come
on
no not thinking yes I'm making you think
past the sale thank you think past the
sale the sale is would we do anything
military with the cartels
so that's the question we're dealing
with
I'm asking you to think past the
question to how much it would cost
the reason I'm doing that is that when
you're thinking about what it costs you
sort of unconsciously accept that this
is a serious thing that could happen
so we're going through the slow process
of getting Congress to understand
what's at stake and what it would cost
and what it would take to fix it so
um
if you hear anybody in congress or the
news
pick up the question of what it would
cost
then you're probably on your way to a
Avenue
if nobody ever talks about the budget
nothing's happening
you get that right the only thing that
matters in this world is is there a
budget
for any you know big any big operations
all that matters is is there a budget if
there's a budget it's going to happen if
there's no budget it won't
and if you're not even talking about the
budget it's not going to happen
so we have we have to move we have to
move the conversation at least to the
budget question I don't care what the
answer is
5 20. we have to be talking about the
budget
to make to to have any chance that
something real will happen if you let
them just talk about yes or no
that's nothing
that's nothing you have to have a
conversation about what it costs because
you know what would happen then
the moment that budget is introduced as
a conversation piece then everybody in
the
military-industrial complex
says
I'll bet I can get some of that
and then it passes
because that's who you know we presume
controls the government so you've got to
get the money talk out there so that the
people who could make money from it can
start moving the government in the
direction of what will make them money
now I don't mind if our I don't mind at
all
I don't mind at all
if the military industry makes some
money at the same time we solve the
fentanyl problem that'd be fine
yes we'll talk about balloons
so uh Ohio exploded
see you next next topic balloons
balloons how about those balloons
did we need Ohio
Ohio is a state right
it's a state
apparently it's been destroyed in a
toxic
vinyl chloride cloud of deadly gas
the whole State's gone no no no no it's
not it's not it's not
most of the state is still intact there
is part of it that you wouldn't want to
live in for a long time
but most of it's intact I'm just kidding
Ohio is still here
but uh here's everything we know about
it
big explosion
something deadly
so I don't know
everything about that story is
suspicious but that's all we know about
it all right let's talk about uh giant
balloons and stuff
so here's what we know oh no before we
talk about that I got to talk about tick
tock
um I predicted that the Chinese spy
balloon drama
would make it more likely that Congress
would ban tick tock
more likely
I was totally wrong
yeah I thought I saw something
encouraging in the news but I'm totally
wrong
so what was encouraging was that uh
Fox News was putting pressure on
Governor uh Whitney Whitmer I mean
because she was still using Tick Tock
but she claims that she only uses it on
a device that has nothing on it but Tick
Tock I mean nothing important but tick
tock
does that suggest that she should be in
government
that sort of suggests
that you're not qualified to be the
governor if you believe Tick Tock is so
dangerous that you won't even use it
unless it's a dedicated device
and yet you're not in favor of banning
it everywhere
you can't be in government that's just
stupid
that's just stupid and if you're going
to be stupid right in front of us you
can't be our leaders come on don't be
that stupid you can be biased you can be
uninformed but don't be stupid right in
front of us there's no extra data that
has to be collected for you to have a
full opinion about this situation if
it's too dangerous for the government
that's all you need
there's no other analysis needed
it's just too dangerous oh my God so I
hope she gets embarrassed by that
but apparently Senator Schumer has said
that it's worth looking into Banning it
Banning tick tock he says worth looking
into and I guess the Commerce
Department's looking into it
and of course you know he being a major
Democrat but also Sarah
Huckabee Sanders is that her last name
uh she's also in favor of the Banning
Tick Tock as well because she's
basically
uh
is it Sarah Huckabee is there last does
she have a married name on the end of
that
Sanders right which is a weird
coincidence
yeah so Sarah Huckabee Sanders continues
to say basically every right thing
isn't it funny that if you take somebody
who's a a very capable
spokesperson for a president
and then you put him in the job where
they have to say the right things and
not the wrong things
she says all the right things
have you noticed
like she is so capable
and youngest youngest Governor or
youngest female governor I can't
remember but at that age
at that age she's operating
really at a pretty high level not just a
governor level but she's operating above
Governor level she's operating at a
Federal level of Effectiveness but she's
a governor at the moment
yeah she's doing great
now which is you know different from
saying I would necessarily agree with
every policy but as a republican who's
trying to make a
make a dent in the system she's
certainly doing it
all right but
um neither Sarah Huckabee Sanders Norris
Schumer seemed to understand the tick
tock threat
so while I thought this Chinese biplane
would get us closer especially since
both sides seem to be at least open to
the question
neither of them can voice the actual
risk the risk is not data security
they keep saying it's data security now
it's also data security
that's not a nothing it's important we
should definitely be considering it but
the real risk is they have a button
literally labeled heat in whatever
language
uh and they can make anything Trend by
pushing that button they literally
literally
this is a proper use of literally
have a user interface for American
brains
literally that's not an analogy it's
actually a user interface to control a
human brain in the United States
and nobody seems to think that's a big
deal
they're worried about the data security
the data security is way down the list
of risks way down it's still a big risk
but it's way down the list it's not even
close to that stupid little heat button
where they can make anything important
to Americans or anything unimportant by
not touching the button
all right let's go private on locals
all right local is your private
um
so then uh I thought it was useful that
Schumer said oh yes it's worth looking
into Banning it I thought okay well
that's something it's worth looking into
and then he says that the Commerce
department is looking into it
oh
they're not doing anything
[Laughter]
how long does it take how long does it
take the Commerce Department to say
do they have a heat button
yes
that's the end of the meeting
would you like to be to model that again
here's the Commerce Department trying to
decide whether Tick Tock should be
banned do they have a button one button
that they can push to make something
Trend and therefore are they the human
interface are they the interface for the
American Minds yes
unambiguously
this is not a question of maybe you're
maybe not
Tick Tock says this directly we have a
button and when we push it it makes
things go viral that's not
there's no gray area here
it's designed to do exactly what we
don't want it to do control human Minds
in America
if the Commerce Department can't figure
that out who's in charge of the Commerce
Department give me a name
get me a name of who's in charge of the
Commerce Department
okay let's find out who that is because
whoever is in charge of the Commerce
department is either dragging or as a
communist agent there's a Chinese agent
I mean it's one or the other there's
either massive incompetence or somebody
who's gotten to him because there's no
way there is no way in the world that
the head of the Commerce Department
understands take the hook
and it takes them more than 10 minutes
to make a decision
I it can't be possible that that person
even understands the issue because
here's what all that is happening
I will bet any amount of money that all
of the delay
is in conversations about how to keep
the data in the United States and not
let the ccpc it
that probably that's probably
complicated and it depends you have to
negotiate with who's doing what and who
would hold it and there might be some
lawyers involved I can see why that
would take a long time
but that also suggests they don't
understand the threat you don't need to
know about any of that
all of that data security stuff you
should ignore
because you're going to ban the whole
thing you don't need to ban just the
data and spend all your time trying to
keep the data safe when the entire
platform should be banned for obvious
reasons it's got a heat button it's the
user interface for brains and is pointed
at America brains American brains by an
adversary
is there anything else to say
I mean I'm preaching to the choir at
this point so Gina raymondi is the one
who's either incompetent or bought off
already right so we don't know which it
is she's either completely incompetent
so let's let's get her in the news
I'll have to confirm that but let's
let's get her in the news I want to find
out if she even knows what the risk is I
will bet you I'll bet you she doesn't
even know the risk
you want to take that back
I'll bet you also that there's nobody at
Fox News who's going to get her on the
TV and ask her the question
you want to take that bet the the most
obvious thing that Fox News should do or
anybody who's right leading news
they should get the head of the Commerce
department on and say do you understand
the risk and then when they say data
data data the Fox News host says you
know they have a heat button and they
can program our minds directly and you
didn't even mention that how are you the
one who's looking into it you don't even
know what the risk is how many
months did it take you to figure out
what the risk is and you couldn't get it
that one
was justified
that was justified
every app can do that that's right and
every app is not controlled
by the CCP
that's not a point
it doesn't matter if other apps can do
it I'm not really
you know nearly as concerned if
Instagram does it I mean well that's
that's a separate battle but it's
different
no cursing goodbye
put user in timeout
all right
uh I guess we're talking about these uh
balloons
yeah let's talk about the balloons so
there were three more suspicious
balloons
um did you know that the U.S has been
launching its own surveillance balloons
for the United States
our own balloons to look for criminals
and stuff since 2019.
all right so here's the first fact you
need to know the U.S has been creating
surveillance balloons
for the U.S
for years
okay
here's what else you need to know
the Pentagon does not know what what is
keeping these objects Aloft
[Laughter]
they've seen them and they don't what's
keeping them Aloft so they don't want to
they don't want to rush to say balloon
because they can't see a propulsion
system or they don't what's capital of
now I'm going to call on this
I'm going to call total they're
either space garbage or space balloons
yeah there's space balloons or space
garbage and the military is just lying
to you when they say they don't know
what's keeping you Aloft apparently
they've not ruled out UFOs or something
okay this is ridiculous
this is clearly space garbage they also
told us that they changed the
sensitivity of their radar I guess and
once they change the sensitivity
which they had intentionally
kept less sensitive because all of this
little garbage stuff that they would
detect they would have to spend all
their time finding that finding out if
it's important but little things that
don't move very fast
tend not to be that important
they tend to be weather balloons
so apparently we have a a system in
which we just didn't look at anything
that was too small
but they've changed the sensitivity
now they're seeing these smaller things
and they can't identify exactly what
they are
so they're blowing them up
because we probably want to look tough
and decisive
now here's my best hypothesis of what's
Happening
I think we're blowing up defective uh
weather balloons
or surveillance balloons
our own surveillance Bloons I think
we're blowing up our own assets maybe
some foreign assets that you know were
irrelevant maybe they were weather
balloons but I think we're just blowing
up stuff to show that we can blow up
stuff
remember at one point people said oh
that Chinese balloon is proving that we
can't defend our airspace right what
would be the best thing you could do to
prove that you really could defend your
airspace
well you would pretend to be blowing up
tiny little things that you saw far away
because if we can spot these tiny little
things from far away and so far are you
impressed that we're uh four for four
are you impressed every one of our every
one of our missiles hit its Target
exactly the message you want to send to
China huh interesting
now do you think you would know it if
the first five missiles missed
you think the military would say you
know it took us six missiles to hit a
practically stationary object
nope nope
this looks to be entirely a military
propaganda operation
meaning that I think we're just showing
that we can blow up and detect small
things so don't try it
that's what it looks like
so it looks like it's all theater I
don't think they're threats I don't
think they're UFOs I don't think they're
even necessarily from China although
they could be
now it's on I was on a spaces
um conversation Twitter spaces where you
have audio conversations
and I was listening to Tom Fenton being
quite convinced
that these were Chinese assets the
additional ones that were shot down
based on the fact that we took them so
seriously we shot them down
at least one of them didn't look like he
had a payload but that doesn't mean the
other ones didn't so and it doesn't mean
that the one also doesn't you should not
trust any information
so Tom Finn's take and some other expert
Types on that call
we're saying that the most likely thing
is that they're Chinese balloons
and that they're preparing for an attack
and it's targeting information
now that doesn't mean imminent attack
but it would mean figuring out where all
their targets are because there's no
points and no point having nuclear
weapons unless you know where to shoot
them
but
do you think China didn't know where to
put their nuclear weapons
really
they they know they can't take out all
of our missile silos because we've got
submarines and
and airplanes
so
I don't buy the story that China is
doing targeting runs
they might be I mean the the big spy
plane might have been but I don't
believe that whatever the smaller ones
are are doing the same thing
now China says that the U.S has sent 10
10 spy balloons over them
since since last year do you believe
that
do you believe that the U.S has sent
tens my balloons over China because our
our other assets can't see what we want
to see
it's plausible
but
I don't know who knows
uh I would say a hundred percent of what
we find out about this story is likely
to be untrue one of the structures that
was blown up was reportedly octagonal
it was shaped like an octagon
now they said it was uncrewed but I
suspect Conor McGregor was in there
but that's what I just think he was in
there
just speculating
Maybe
um he likes to be inside octagons is
what I'm saying
all right so we got one shot down by an
F-16 over Lake Huron of F-22 took one
around at 40 000 feet over Canada uh an
F-22 got another one around where was it
somewhere else
how many weather balloons do you think
are launched per year
what do you think
how many weather balloons are launched
per year
a lot
thousands yeah
it's like a multiple per day it's like
every day weather balloons would go down
so some of it now some of the weather
balloons will reach certain height and
then they pop because of the so but I
don't know if they all have been there
we go uh
remember those things that seem to defy
do you remember the UFOs that defied
physics they'd be going in One Direction
and then they'd like immediately go the
other direction
doesn't that seem like a balloon in the
Wind
if you saw a balloon in the Wind
and it was where it could run into let's
say big gusts and just like change
directions
if you believed it was a solid metal
ship and you saw go
sh suddenly the other direction what do
you think it defied physics
but if it were a plastic bag or a
balloon and it just hit a real you know
violent uh
wind pattern
wouldn't it look like it defied physics
because it just went in the opposite
direction really quickly
it would right
defies physics yeah it doesn't Define
the physics of a balloon
foreign
so I will not rule out Tom fitton Tom
fitton's argument that China is sending
stuff over here to Target us for a
potential attack
could be
I wouldn't rule it out would you
I just think that the far more likely
explanation
is that we're all worked up over space
garbage
that's what I think
I think it's just space garbage
probably and I think the pilots are
probably having a great time
wouldn't you love to be a pilot and you
get to shoot down a plastic bag
it'd just be fun
wouldn't it I mean I don't know what
it's like to be a fighter pilot but I
feel like going on a going on a little
flight to shoot down something that
isn't shooting at me just to see if I
could get it
'd be kind of fun target practice Yeah
so my bottom line is I think that they
are nothings they're not UFOs or they're
not aliens they're not necessarily
Chinese but they could be
uh and that we're just shooting them
down to show that we can shoot things
down and we even used two different
types of jets
we can shoot it down with this jet we
can shoot it down with that jet oh we
got Jets all over the place all we have
to do is tune our radar and you'll never
get through our net
yeah
all right well I was watching CNN to see
if they're still unbiased
um
and here was Abby Phillips take who
apparently never got the memo from CNN's
New Management
that you're not supposed to act like
this
so there's still some still some
leftovers in the uh CNN who didn't get
the memo that they should be
uh objective and she was saying that uh
the the moment that the GOP hearing
on the weaponization of the FBI and
social media and stuff she's saying that
the GOP hearing on that backfired and
totally fell apart
based on the news that Trump had once
asked or somebody for Trump had once
once asked for an insulting Christy
Teigen tweet to be taken down
and they said no
and that was what she used
as there evidence that the entire
hearing about the weaponization of the
FBI
had fallen apart because that one time
Trump asked for one and keep in mind
the thing that Trump asked to be taken
down had no informational value it was
just an insult
was everybody worried about the FBI
talking to Twitter to remove personal
insults
I don't remember that story do you
I remember a story about them trying to
influence elections
I remember that story but I don't
remember the one about them fighting
social media to take the insults down
you know the one the one insult the one
tweet the one time
that's it and according to Abby Phillips
that makes the entire investigation null
because Trump did it too
even though what he did was completely
unrelated to the issue
he just didn't like that insult there
now I don't think he should have asked
for it to be taken down and neither did
Twitter so they didn't and that was the
end of the story there was no follow-up
now
am I wrong that that's that's CNN being
bad CNN right
am I wrong
yeah that there that's just them being
bad this is this is not even close to
being a balanced approach
uh when we go private
I'm going to tell you remind me on
locals after I'm done with YouTube I'm
going to tell you a private story that
relates to this that's non-public
you get the good stuff you get the good
stuff
all right um
here's a prediction I think rich people
are all going to go to private school
and school choice and that public school
will be all this left for poor people
and it will just get worse and worse
because it's just school for poor people
is there any way to avoid that I don't
think so
I don't think that could be avoided
and basically it's going to become
public school be school for black kids
basically
that's what's going to happen
because at some point
it was just going to happen
so we don't have a a mechanism to avoid
that future but maybe we should maybe we
should here's a provocative question I
asked let's see if you know the answer
would it be legal
in the United States would it be legal
to start a college that was a men only
College go would that be legal
now if you say yes
you're probably saying yes because there
are four of them that already exist
right
but do you think that's the same
do you think that if you were to start a
new one in 2023 it would just fly right
through hey we got four of them already
they seem to be fine
let's have another one
I don't think so
I have a feeling that it would not be
fine I I have a feeling that it would
only be fine
uh
well the the ones that already exist
maybe they're letting them remain
now there's so there are now women-only
colleges and men only colleges but just
a few
and the only reason I asked is I would
hate to go to a male lonely College I
can't think of anything worse than that
a male only college but God but it does
occur to me that all of the uh
uh let's say the woke stuff is coming
from women
I feel like if you had an all-male
College all that stuff will go away
because it's all women driven
that's not to say that plenty of men
don't say it but men only say it because
there are women watching
that's an exaggeration of course that's
a little hyperbole for you men only
agree with the wokeness thing when women
are watching they're just looking for
their approval that's all that's all if
you leave if you leave men to themselves
they just fight until somebody wins
were very simple we will just fight for
dominance until somebody wins and then
somebody's in charge until somebody else
beats them
but when you put women around us we'll
we'll try to signal to the women in
whatever way they think they want to see
the signal
so it does seem to me that women have
ruined higher education through the
wokeness stuff I don't think male only
College fixes that just an observation
all right um
so here's a little update on the Russia
Ukraine war
either Russia has made some gains lately
or they have not made gains lately or
they've stayed exactly the same are you
happy
is everybody happy that I understand
that all of the information out of the
area is unreliable
because I can't even talk about the
topic without the NPCs why do you trust
that story why do you trust that story
no I don't trust anything coming out of
Ukraine but I'll report it and comment
on
so why the Wagner group seems to be
making all the uh whatever gains there
are and they seem to be doing it by
using sledgehammers to kill anybody they
think is not fighting hard enough on
their own team
so basically
they're using the you know the prisoners
and conscripts as you know human fodder
and they're just throwing them into the
machine guns of the ukrainians does that
sound real
do you believe that do you believe do
you believe that waves of Russians are
running into the machine gun fire of
ukrainians everywhere they go
hasn't just happened a few times but
everywhere they go ukrainians are mowing
them down by by the thousands probably
not
probably not has it ever happened
probably yes
probably yes so the Russians do have a
history of you know wave after wave of
human sacrifice to to take an inch of
soil but we don't know what's happening
is just reported
by all sources which are
undependable out of that area
but here's my interesting takes
um
I do imagine that you could perpetually
send people to die
if their alternative was dying right
away
so I do believe you could perpetually
have enough humans who are Russian
soldiers as long as it takes would you
all agree with that Russia will not run
out of
humans
before the war is over what do you say
is there now Ukraine's Got A maybe a
different problem with human power
but I don't think Russia is going to run
out of people because they don't care
all right but I heard an interesting
hypothesis today
that um
the artillery that the Russians are
using which is a big part of their
military that the utility that you the
artillery
um the gun barrels go bad
after you've used them for a certain
amount of time were you aware of that
did you know that the gun barrel itself
wears out
so so basically they're huge artillery
junk piles already
so apparently we can spot from the air
you know just huge junk piles and I
think the ratio is that three of them
will break for every one that you
destroy with a missile
does that sound right the three of them
will break or melt or whatever they do
three of them will go down for their own
reasons for every one that you could
take out militarily
now balanced against that is that Russia
is a huge arms manufacturing company
wouldn't you love to know how much
artillery they can make per day with
their factories
it seems like that would be interesting
to know because we have some reporting
about how many pieces of artillery are
being taken out and it seems to be
significant
um
by how many are the addicts
so there's one possibility that they run
out of artillery
before they run into people
and I think that's a worthy hypothesis I
don't know how to rank that
but that feels like that's possible it
feels like
just replace the barrel
yeah but that's probably not easy in the
field during war
all right
um and then the next thing that is
interesting is that the head of the
Wagner group
he may be creating a military
that's stronger than whatever is
protecting Putin
do you think the edge of the Wagner
group would like to run Russia
feel like yes
I feel like yes you might like that so
very soon
no matter what happens to Ukraine
Putin and the head of the Wagner group
are gonna there's gonna be one remaining
in five years
there's very little chance that the head
of the Wagner group Ann Putin will still
be alive at the same time would you
agree I feel like as soon as the head of
the Wagner group is not necessary he's
necessary at the moment as soon as he's
not necessary Putin's going to kill him
but why wouldn't he
has to because the head of the Wagner
group would definitely kill Putin
and he might have the he might have the
means to do it and I don't think we want
that guy replacing Putin so we might be
in the weird situation of trying to
protect Putin from his own military
because Putin is still better than the
head of the Wagner group maybe oh
they're both pretty bad
anyway I think the head of the Wagner
group's going to be killed by Putin
before long
um
is there any topic I missed
do you think that the uh all the UFO
balloon stuff is just a diversion
just a diversion
here's why I don't think that
necessarily
because I guess you could say that every
day
because every day there's a story that's
negative about somebody usually the
government and every day there's some
other story
and we don't always just spend all our
time looking at that negative government
story so it seems to me that chance
alone would fill us with alternative
stories every day
so to imagine that some of those
alternative stories that happen to be
interesting are intentionally diversions
we don't even need diversions because
the news itself
comes up with interesting alternatives
to your government is evil
because you can't listen to that all day
you gotta have something else
um political disarray in the zielinski
cabinet yeah I I could see the Ukrainian
government falling apart that wouldn't
be a stretch
and I don't know what happens if
zelenski dies
that would be that would be
unpredictable
uh are they being vague I don't know
yeah I covered Ohio Ohio blew up and
nobody cared
but there's something sketchy going on
in Hawaii we just don't know what it is
yet
oh the one thing I heard about the Ohio
derailment can somebody give me a fact
check on this I retweeted it because I
think it's true
was there just recently a new movie
featuring that exact town with that
exact problem a train derailment
followed by a chemical spill
that's that's a real thing that happened
right yeah on Netflix oh it was in
Pennsylvania not Ohio
okay so it wasn't there it was just a
similar scenario where a train
derailed and there was a suspicious gas
leak
yeah
Pennsylvania and Ohio are the same state
somebody says
all right uh the movie is called the
white noise and made in 2022.
all right
uh country of the balance of Love Boat
who remembers actor Robert Wagner
do you remember actor Robert Wagner
somebody mentioned Robert Wagner the
actor because of the Wagner group
um all right here's my story about
Robert Wagner
once his head
was right by my feet for an
uncomfortable long time
true story Robert Wagner the actor his
head
was near my feet like you know just this
far away
for an uncomfortably long time
can you can you figure out what that was
anybody want to guess it wasn't an
airplane it was not any form of
transportation
no Transportation was not yoga was not
baseball game
all right I'll tell you the answer
I got invited to a
a filming of
which show was it because there were two
different filmings it was either
Two and a Half Men
I think it was Two and a Half Men
uh he was an extra on Two and a Half Men
right
can you confirmed that wasn't he like
the
somebody's father or somebody
anyway he had a friend who was attending
the taping I got invited because they
they mentioned Dilbert in that episode
so the writers invited me
and because I was like a special guest I
got to sit up front now if you're in the
audience
um if you're in the audience the
audience is raised above the stage floor
so that when you're looking down you can
see everything better
so the the stage is is maybe chest High
right so the the first row is maybe four
feet above the stage
I happen by coincidence to be sitting
next to a personal guest of actor Robert
Wagner and between takes uh and breaks
he would come over and talk to his
friend
so he'd walk over to the stage and he'd
walk up to it and he'd be like right by
my left foot and his big old Robert
Wagner head would be there talking to
the person next to me
and it's so awkward
because if a famous person is right by
your foot
you just want to look at them
don't you
just sort of you're right there
just won't look at him but I couldn't
look at him because he was just by my
feet
there's no Robert Wagner giant head
right next to my feet I'm just looking
around look at those lights up there no
Robert Wagner had that was just awkward
true story
all right
um I'm going to go tell a private story
to the locals people and uh thanks for
joining on YouTube we'll see you
tomorrow best live stream you've ever
seen
