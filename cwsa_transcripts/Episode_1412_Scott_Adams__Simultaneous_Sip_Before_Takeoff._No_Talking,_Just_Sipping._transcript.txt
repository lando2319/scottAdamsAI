we're not going to be very noisy today
because we're on a plane but i didn't
want to miss the simultaneous scent
so if you've got a copper mug or a glass
tanker chalices dive canteen jug or
flask of vessel of any kind
this would be the time to get it out i'm
going to give you a little tour
of the first class accommodations here
on emirates
in a moment are you ready
go
oh that's good that's good
now i should tell you that
um i'm on emirates and they had some
ridiculously good deal
and let me show you what the
accommodations look like
this is my seat
in emirates
see what kind of headphones i got
holy cow these look pretty good
i should tell you i wouldn't normally
have this kind of accommodations
that's right it's got a door
this thing closes
and i've got the most attractive seat
mate of all time
right across the hall
yeah i didn't want to miss so
we're going from santorini to newark
it's going to be kind of a shock
santorini to do work
all right well i can read your comments
but i'm not going to do a lot of talking
because i don't want to bother people
here
andrew says andrew says hello
andrew andrews on here
christina says hi andrew
yeah it's non-stop from athens to newark
and the i think that the trip was like a
20 of what it would normally cost for
these seats i wouldn't
typically i would not buy any anything
like this
but they're deeply discounted today for
some reason
all right well i'm not going to do any
politics today because we're going to
take off in a moment
but i didn't want to miss the
simultaneous set
and if there's anybody joining us late i
got my coffee
just in case would you like the closing
simultaneous set yeah yeah there's going
to be another one
that's right it's coming up right now go
oh so good so
good even the coffee is better here
i don't even know if you could hear me
can you even hear me talking
yes um i have snacks
and so a lot of people have to
keep their masks on but if you're eating
you don't so i'll be eating for the next
11 hours
a little bit a little bit because
there's no rule
there's no rule that says how much you
have to eat or how quickly
so i'm just gonna like every hour i'm
doing that
or just a little like that
following the rules
uh it seems like you don't need a mask
in your pod
well let me tell you uh we just were in
the
the lounge area for a number of the
airlines they have a combined lounge
and once people got in the lounge they
they walked over to the food
put some food in front of them and took
off their masks for the entire time
they're there
so in the lounge areas people are
completely maskless because there's food
so they just sit around food and take
their mess off
all right i don't have much else to say
it's just me sitting on a plane
so i'm going to let you guys go back to
whatever you're doing
i'm not sure if i'll be able to talk to
you tomorrow i think i might be in the
air
but we will uh we'll talk again soon
bye for now
