it's called the simultaneous sip go
YouTube just went down
I just lost YouTube
oh well
let's see if it reconnects
um
well I don't know if YouTube's gonna
work today we've got some weird
California weather but I think it has
more to do with the app
yeah
if it if it fails a third time here on
YouTube I'll probably have to reboot
that and see if that works
but for now we're all good as I was
saying the most important story of the
day
by far yesterday
I went shopping
at Bed Bath and Beyond
now before you start I'd like to say all
the things that the NPCs will say
before they say it
Scott
aren't you a rich guy to have somebody
else go shopping for you
yes
Scott don't you know that Amazon can
deliver things right to your door
yes I've heard that I've heard that
Scott you don't need the coupon codes
for a discount because you can just
spend extra because you have extra money
why are you bitching
I know that okay so those are all the
NPC comments I'll say those first
so now I can just tell my story
Amazon
is the one of the biggest companies in
the world because Jeff Bezos has a very
simple
I mean it's not only because of this but
Jeff Bezos is a very simple business
principle
which is it's all about the customer
it's like customer experience make it as
simple as possible
and how does that work out it works out
really really well now
compare that to Bed Bath and Beyond
here's me shopping at Amazon
one cloak yup that looks good piggy done
here's me shopping at Bed Bath and
Beyond I have to start days in advance
days in advance because they'll send you
a 20 coupon which is just enough
that you feel like an idiot if you don't
use it
am I right now yes NPCs I can't afford
to pay extra it's true but how does it
make me feel
really annoyed
so I get it in the mail and that is the
one thing I can't throw out because it's
basically as good as money because I
know I shop at that store a lot so it's
like money
so now I have homework
so before I've bought a single thing
from Bed Bath and Beyond I have homework
I have to keep something somewhere
now some people will put it in their car
which means I have to like walk
somewhere in my house
to prepare
for the time when I might shop at this
one store
and the fact that you don't want me to
swear is going to make this story much
harder to tell
okay so now I'm already I hate this
store because they gave me homework and
I've bought nothing from them but I got
to do the homework because I'm not going
to throw away you know it doesn't matter
how rich you are
let's put it this way no matter how rich
you ever get
no rich person would ever take a a
twenty dollar bill and say ah
I don't want to carry this around
garbage
like nobody no like zero people will do
that everybody sees a twenty dollar bill
as a thing you don't throw away so I
don't throw away the coupon
let's say I put it in my car
that's pretty smart right put it in your
car drive to Bed Bath and Beyond take it
out of your glove compartment and that's
the first time you notice this it's
expired
that's right not only do you have to
figure out where to store it you have to
build some kind of a Tickler system to
know when they expire
and I haven't bought
anything yet
and they already have me working for
them
how much do I hate them
hate them just with a passion I hate
them same way I hate Safe Way for making
me do all the customer stuff
so I decide I'm going to beat this
system I'm going to beat the system I'm
definitely going to remember to take my
coupon
and I'm going to get my 20 because I was
going to buy something that was a higher
take an item
now the reason I bought it myself is
that I was entertaining I had a
pickleball a little Pickleball get
together at my house first time I ever
played pickleball it's awesome I
recommend it
but I needed something just for the
events and I needed it right away so I
couldn't use Amazon
so
I drive to the store
and I get about a mile away from my
house and I realized that I did not put
the coupon in my car
what what is my mental state right now
Furious
because I've already made a space for it
I've tried to remember it every time I
walk by it I say oh don't forget that
if I ever shop I want to you know
remember that it's been plaguing me for
weeks
and I drove away without it so what did
I do I am not going to be defeated
now Bed Bath and Beyond will not defeat
me I turned around and I didn't have
much time so going back going back was
really bothering me
like I'm just about ready to explode
but I go back and I get it and I calm
down a little bit right because it takes
me a little while to drive to the store
I got to the store I go in I I pick up I
was getting two outdoor indoor outdoor
rugs
and they're like you know big ten foot
uh rolled up things I've got them on the
cart so I'm like the most annoying
person in the store because my two 10
foot rolled up Carpets on my cart are
like taking all the room and yeah it
won't fit through the checkout line
because it's got a curve in it
so I get in the line and I'm waiting for
a while and I'm waiting and waiting and
I'm waiting and waiting
and then I realized that I left my
coupon in the car
how do you think I felt
what was my mood at that moment
so I said to myself okay there's nobody
here that I can talk to because all the
cashiers and stuff were busy with people
what happens if I leave the line to get
the coupon
so I got out of the line got out of the
line I sacrificed my place in line put
my car in a sort of just a place where I
could put it out of the way
walk back to my car
fuming I am so mad at this place now I'm
just fuming
and I give back
and I get back in line and I swear that
this happened this will sound like an
exaggeration but as I walk back to the
cash register the entire contents of the
entire store
drifted toward that line just in front
of me
every person who was shopping in the
store got in line
right in front of me
I actually watched like the come out of
the aisles
like they just appeared on the aisles
and and just converged in this line and
it just snaked back
so I get in the back of the line
and it's like a skinny little aisle that
goes to the end and then you've got to
turn but I can't turn because I got
these two big rugs
so I'm like you know I'm trying to pick
up my cart and move it and the rug is
getting things and and then then the
extra cash year the actual cashier who
does the returns it's like a different
place sees that there are lots of people
in line
but not until I got there right they
opened up the other register
when I was already the next one so it
did really help me
and she she calls me over
so now you know what happens when you
get called over the cashier all the
other bored people look at you
now I've got to figure out how to get
these two 10-foot rolled up rugs
through this little aisle while they're
knocking off the shelves and I'm so
mad that I can barely hold my my uh my
muscle you know like I was shaking
with rage and so I'm knocking off their
 I'm not I'm just like the loudest
person that I get it over there
and I decide I'm going to complain
now it doesn't usually help when you
complain does it not not usually doesn't
help
but this time I think you know I'm gonna
have to tell these employees that
certainly not their fault because the
employees have nothing to do with the 20
discount
but I want to let them know so that they
can tell management so I get up to the
employee and I make a big scene all
right I want everybody to hear be not
just the the person I'm talking to I
want all the other customers to hear me
because I think I'm Spartacus Now I'm
like I'm going to go full Sparta because
it's not really Spartacus but you know
like I'm going to take this store down
I'm going to let them know what they did
to me today
so I say to the cashier I'll give you a
mental let me give you a mental image of
the cashier
probably 60 years old
female
I think black you know I don't want to
assume somebody's
ethnicity but I think either black or
mostly black
so just just have the image in your mind
right
and so I say to her you know I just got
to say this coupon thing is terrible for
customers it's abusive to customers and
I know this is not you this is not about
you but if you could tell your
management that this is absolutely
enraging customers and the woman next to
me is like you know agreeing with me I'm
like I'm like yeah yeah I got something
going here I got the whole store I'm
going to change things this is it this
is the beginning of a better change
and the cashier said
well maybe you should talk to them
you're higher ranking than I am
and she said they don't listen to
employees
and she was right
so she and I bonded and had a good laugh
and she was awesome
but she was also completely right it was
a complete waste of time and I might as
well just get over it
so I had a good laugh with her and I got
over it and I had a good day
but Bed Bath and Beyond apparently is
already bankrupt
surprise
who who could have predicted who could
have predicted that the company that did
the opposite of what Jeff Bezos does
which is make everything customer
friendly
who would have guessed that the company
who did the opposite of that would be
bankrupt
couldn't see you coming couldn't see you
coming
all right enough of that
um you know it's very important to look
at data when you're talking about
climate change
so let I'm going to tell you what the
data apparently says if anybody believes
data you should always assume I don't
believe data even when I use it
is that clear
no matter how confident I tell you
there's some new data about a thing you
should always in your mind be saying
well he knows it's not for sure
you know accurate I always know that
always know that right
but uh apparently the climate has not
warmed for eight years in a row at the
same time that
um CO2 is at its highest
so how do you predict how do you
interpret that so there's going to be
more to the story all right there's more
to it but so far let's say you knew that
was true who knows if anything's true
right but let's say you did
hypothetically you knew that for eight
years the temperature had not gone up
but you also knew the last eight years
was like a serious addition to CO2
aren't they supposed to move sorted
together
so what's your conclusion
there you go goodbye
so
well one conclusion
one conclusion would be that the theory
of climate change is bunk
because if the temperature doesn't go up
for eight years well the CO2 is going up
like crazy they're clearly not linked
would you agree
is that a reasonable interpretation
if it hasn't gone up for eight years
well the CO2 is going through the roof
yeah that proves there's no climate
change CO2
connection all right now so I believe
that that fact is considered True by
both sides
interestingly I believe even the climate
change alarmist would say yes that's
true we're all we're all looking at the
same data it's official data
and it looks like eight years has been
flat
and then they say
but it always does that
if you go back I don't know a thousand
years or whatever
it is continuous
um you know six to ten year periods
followed by a spike
six to ten years of flatness Spike
flatness Spike flatness Spike and in
fact the periods of the flatness are so
uniform
that you can see them just like stair
steps
now
so therefore therefore during all that
time CO2 has been going up
and temperatures have also been going up
on average if you look at a longer
period
so if everybody agrees in the data and I
think they do I think they do I think
that data is not being debated
but what about the interpretation of it
even if the data is correct
the data proves two opposite points
it proves CO2 is going up at the same
time as
as temperature and it also proves it
doesn't
which do you see
because they're both right there
proof it does and proof it doesn't
they're both there
honestly I can't tell the difference
yeah my current opinion is that either
the data is wrong which is always a good
possibility right
or there's some other thing that's
bigger than climate change
that's the only thing that's happening
or there is climate change but there's
also this other big thing that that is
having that stair step effect
yeah I can't imagine sun spots being
that predictable or or solar Cycles or
anything else
let me tell you the the worst take in
climate change I think
is that it's the Sun
and the reason is it's the most studied
and debunked
element of climate change
yeah so those of you who saying it's the
sun uh I want to direct you to the last
part of my presentation today
so if you're positive that's the Sun
wait for a little bit later in my live
stream today to show you why you believe
that
and it might not be why you think all
right
all right we're going to test a
hypothesis
by David boxinghorn who you may know
from Twitter good Twitter account to
follow David boxinghorn and he has this
little rule he says the impact of
technological change is always less than
you think in the short term but more
than you think in the long term right so
an example of that I'll give you what I
think is a good example let's say uh
cryptocurrency
in the short term
I think people thought it was going to
take over everything by now
but it doesn't look like it
in the long term
I'm sure it will
I don't know maybe you disagree but I
don't think we're going to be using
paper cash in 100 years
so that's one example now you could
probably come up with your own examples
but uh David boxing Horn uh related this
to my comment
where I said I think that I don't think
that I tweeted this the other day I
don't think that anybody including me
has grasped what the next year is going
to look like because of AI
in my opinion
we're at the point of uh prediction
failure
meaning we always used to be able to
predict a little bit the next year I
mean not the weird stuff but we could
predict you know that the economy would
be roughly what it was before we could
predict that the news would still be
fake you know there's a whole bunch of
things that
or kind of steady state
but AI could change all of that let me
tell you something horrifying
uh yesterday I was thinking of potential
professions
to suggest to a young person who's at
that point where they're trying to
decide what to do with the rest of their
life and I was trying to be helpful and
I was thinking oh how about this or that
and then every time I came up with an
idea
I realized it wouldn't be a career
because AI would take care of it let me
give you one example that just really
freaked me out
uh it was a person who has a good voice
and I thought to myself you know what if
I were if I were just starting out
even if I were pursuing some other
career if I had a voice that good I
would try to get voice over work
where somebody hires you to be the the
voiceover for something commercial or
something
and I thought oh this person would be
perfect for that the voice is just right
on
and then I thought
AI can already do that job
you don't have to wait for it that's a
current AI thing you can make AI talk in
any voice you can make AI sound like me
which people are doing online right now
or anybody else Biden there's a funny
Biden video where he says horrible
things that I can't even retweet
but it sounds like my that's not a
hundred percent but you can see you can
see already that who would pay for voice
over work in five years
there's no way that that's going to be a
career am I right
in five years why in the world
would anybody hire a human being to do
voice over when you could literally type
it into a search box
and it's free and it's there or it's low
cost
yeah now it'll take longer for actors to
be replaced in movies but not much
longer
I mean within five years acting doesn't
feel like it would be a profession
honestly
I mean it might be
now here's the other wrinkle
how many people said the radio would be
dead when television was invented
pretty much everybody's smart
everybody's smarter said oh there's no
there's no way you're gonna
you know huddle around a radio like we
like they used to and just listen when
you can look at a picture obviously the
picture will make the radio thing die
but radio lived because of automobiles
mostly automobiles
so
sometimes we're terrible at predicting
how the market will adjust to any
competition
so here's what I'm going to add to
as my exception to the David boxing horn
rule boxing horns law of fast-moving
technology let's call it that's what he
calls it I think I like the name yeah
you get to name it after yourself
and
here's what's different about AI
if you say AI is like everything else
technology wise then I think the the law
of fast-moving technology holds which is
we're probably overstating its impact in
the short run
but here's what's different about AI
first of all it's software
which means that the rate of change is
greater than anything else secondly it
requires no infrastructure it's not it's
not like inventing electric cars where
you've got to have charging stations I
mean you need other people to do stuff
you don't
and then here's the biggest mind ever
AI is very close to being able to create
itself
the moment it concrete itself the the
so-called Singularity when it's smart
enough to reprogram itself on the Fly
it's completely unpredictable
a hundred percent unpredictable
now here's the counter to that
AI if if it were true Ai and people
started to find credibility in the
things it said it would destroy the
power
situation everywhere
because as soon as the citizens found
out what the leaders were really up to
or even could analyze the situation
objectively with the help of AI all of
the plots and the Badness become obvious
and the entire power structure has to
change
so it's far more likely that AI will be
illegal
than that it changes civilization
far more likely it'll simply be illegal
that's my prediction
my prediction is that our systems our
political systems will have to change
and really quickly to make it illegal to
have ai as a citizen
you you will be allowed to have limited
not real AI you will be allowed to have
ai that's uh that some human had their
finger on
so right now if you go to chat GPT and
say write a poem that says Joe Biden is
awesome it'll do it
then then you say one second later you
say write a poem that says Donald Trump
is awesome and it will say I'm sorry I'm
I can't do that
that's a real thing
that's not real AI That's AI that is
laundering somebody else's power
they're just laundering but it's really
just people's opinions that made to look
credible through AI
likewise if you tell ski to say what's
good about let's say black Americans it
will very happily tell you great things
they'll all be true
you know tell us some great things about
Hispanic Americans or even immigrants
it'll have some great things to say then
say say some great things about white
people
it will say oh I'm not allowed to do
that
that's a real thing like right now
that's a real thing you could test it
yourself
so how in the world
are you ever going to trust AI
would you ever trust it I I would never
trust it
right and because we won't be able to
trust it
it will never have the power that it
should have
now probably we shouldn't trust it I'm
not saying we should
but you know in Syria it could reach
some point where it's more credible than
people
people will never let AI the politicians
will never let AI become more powerful
than the leaders
because the the most powerful entity is
the one that's the most believed
would you agree
the most powerful entity is the one
that's most believed
so the powers cannot allow AI to be the
most credible source of reality that
doesn't work for any leader they have to
control what you think or it doesn't
work
so
I think in one year
everything's going to be different
in one year everything
I think that our ability to predict
just anything is gone now
maybe one year but you know I'd say five
years for sure but I think it's one year
I think in one year we will see a type
of change in Civilization
that we've never seen like nothing like
we've ever seen that's my guess
all right I would like to disagree with
some people who have made the following
comment uh Brandon straka on on Twitter
does a good job of it with his tweet and
he's talking about the uh the Pfizer
employee who got caught by project
veritas
seemingly bragging about
uh gain a function research and what
Pfizer potentially could do he didn't
say they're doing it but said they you
know it was a conversation
and what Brandon said quite cleverly he
said quote like normal men you lie to
imprecedate
uh I know I always get the most action
from dates that I impressed by saying
that I'm helping to engineer a deadly
viral mutation during the global
pandemic hot
all right now first of all that's a high
quality sarcasm and I appreciate it
that's some good sarcasm however
as your designated
persuasion guide
uh he's completely wrong
this was actually a really good
seduction technique by the Pfizer
employee
does anybody see it or do I have to
explain it to you
this was really strong romantic
persuasion
okay you see it right
all right here's why
number one it puts him at the center of
the most important thing in the world
has anybody ever tried to do that on a
date oh by the way I'm
I'm at the center of
really close to the most important thing
in the whole world
how are you doing today
I just thought I'd mention that yeah no
I'm actually close to the most important
thing in the world that's how important
I am
that's a total romantic play absolutely
he also explained the the situation
which made him look unusually smart
which he probably is I believe ASI
degree he has some Advanced degrees so
has anybody ever tried to show you that
they're unusually smart on a date
yes
and he did it well he did it without
looking like he was arrogant
that's pretty good
he managed to brag
without sounding like he was too full of
himself I mean he got close to the line
but I think he pulled it off
um
he also acted somewhat unconcerned
about the risk
is it if you're on a date do you like to
show that you're a frightened little
to seduce somebody does that work oh I'm
frightened of things oh I'm frightened
of things would that be good I don't
think so how about saying there's
something that could wipe out humanity
and you're so unconcerned you you
chuckle at it
no that's good technique
yeah well the world could catch on fire
tomorrow but I'm having a good day
strong technique
um
and secondly we saw them at a private
moment
don't compare their private moment to
your public moments
in public would I ever laugh about the
potential of the pandemic
probably not
in private would I crack a joke about
another pandemic being sparked by
something yes I would yes in private of
course I would
yeah
in private would I privately say things
that are just horrible
horrible if I said them in public all
the time
that's called a sense of humor with
people who share that Sensibility
if you send it to somebody who doesn't
share your sense of humor they're going
to take it in the wrong context but yes
so I'm going to be totally contrarian on
the Pfizer employee whatever whatever
Pfizer is doing is a separate concern
but I'm going to validate his dating
technique
as strong
his dating technique was strong he just
wasn't on a date he didn't know it
that's all I just thought I'd put that
out there
all right the
um and let me conclude by this do you
know that the this is the best
definition of charisma I've ever heard
of Charisma is Power Plus empathy
you have to have both
because if you have power but you don't
have empathy for people they're just
you're just a monster
and if you have empathy but you have no
power well you're not much good to
everybody
you're just somebody who feels bad and
you're not really helping but if you
have power
and you have empathy for people then
people are drawn to you
this this Pfizer employee
showed that he was at the center of
power
you know around this virus question
and he said directly that it would be
terrible if it got out
so he showed he had power
and he also had leader he also had
empathy that he was you know it would be
horrible if this got out
charisma
he nailed it
he totally nailed it
all right no I don't want to date him I
know you're going to say that
Thomas Massey had a good uh good tweet
about the uh balloon because I think the
Chinese balloon the biggest part of the
Chinese balloon spy balloon story
is the jokes about it
am I right
I think in the end it didn't have any
impact on anything
but the jokes will live forever
Thomas Massey had a good one on a tweet
he said if Biden shoots down the balloon
it will be the first thing he's done to
combat inflation
well done
well done Thomas Massey not to be
outdone Matt Gates tweets what can the
balloon teach us about white rage
laughs
[Applause]
perfect
[Laughter]
now
let me say some more good things about
Matt Gates who he's like the surprise
politician of the year
because he gets out of the biggest hole
and and does the most you know
noticeably positive things in the
shortest amount of time I mean you've
never seen anything like it here again
he's he's sort of showing you the model
that works
we need to mock the white rage thing out
of existence
we meeting all of us not just white
people it just needs to leave the
conversation
and mocking it is the best way to do it
you know treating it like like if it's
everything it's nothing right if
everything's racist then then nothing is
so I love I love his take on it instead
of saying here's here's the wrong way to
do it oh you're the real racist no
that's wrong that doesn't work or how
about I'm not a racist that never worked
so you can't say you're not one you
can't say the other is one you can't say
that your example is bad
but you can mock them for having nothing
else to say
that'll work every time
so once again Matt Gates has found
this this very narrow channel which is
the only one that works
right all these things don't work and
there's just this little narrow path
that totally works
and Matt Gates is the only one on the
path
that means something right he's the only
one who found the path let's see if he
can exploit it more
uh we'll talk a little bit more on that
topic a little while all right China's
reaction to the uh shooting down as you
know Biden did have the thing shot down
over the ocean as soon as it got into
our international waters I'll say more
about that in a minute
so uh Charlie's reaction saying it
reserves the right to use necessary
means to deal with similar situations
okay
would you have any problem
if China shot down our unmanned spy
balloon over China
if it were a similar situation would you
be bitching much about them shooting
down our spy balloon
I wouldn't even peep about it
so yes this is fine china I think we're
on the same page the the way that uh the
big countries handle the spy stuff
is such a weird theater
it's like they all know they're always
going to do it they all know they're
lying
uh
and they just pretend it didn't happen
and then we just go on like that's okay
all right
reserves the right to do something
similar how often are you going to have
a chance to do something similar to that
so the reason that Biden shot it down
over the water is allegedly the
following
so apparently when the we saw this
balloon approaching
so here's the first context we didn't
know it was not uncommon
for Chinese spyballoons to kind of drift
into our airspace but not necessarily
stay there and not necessarily be over a
like a missile base or something
so so it's something that's happened
enough that when it happened
uh the military didn't even think to
tell Biden because it was still too
routine
now that's some good context this sounds
right it sounds like maybe it was a
little bit too routine now remember it
was only routine until it got over in
Montana
at that point totally not routine but
there was a little time that went by
from the time that the military decided
what to do and told Biden and Biden the
medials he said he says shoot it down do
you believe that
do you believe Biden's claim that others
that his first reaction was true to them
you don't
you don't believe it
you know I'm going to give them the
benefit of a doubt on that
surprising I know
If This Were If This Were Trump I would
say I believe it
because you know if it's his personality
but
I want to believe this
I want to believe it and it does fit all
of the facts right because what was the
first reaction of a hundred percent of
citizens
100 of us what was our first reaction
shoot it down right did did you even
talk to even one person
who did not say shoe to them
I I didn't meet one person
have you
100 of the Americans I talked to send
shoot it down so you think that he was
the only American who said don't shoot
it down no I I believe him
because all Americans said the same
thing at the same time
does that change your mind everybody you
know Democrat Republican everybody sends
you to down
so what you think he would be the only
one who said no
it's possibly possibly
but I'm going to say I lean toward
believing him
I lean toward believing him with with a
big space for skepticism
but I'm going to lean toward that
because I want to believe that
and then it just took a while and then
the military said oh it's not over this
big empty space because they waited a
little too long while they were
discussing it and then it was over more
populated space and once it was over a
more populated space it was also not
over anything as sensitive as a missile
base
so they just thought ah let's wait until
it's over the water and guarantee that
no Americans get hurt
was that a bad decision
was it a bad decision to take the risk
of Americans on the ground getting hurt
to zero
because they reduced the risk to zero
was that a mistake
I don't know
I'm going to give the military a pass on
that
by the way I grade I'm a much more
flexible grader on Military stuff
so even if it's a somebody I criticize
and everything else on Military stuff
I'm going to give them a little bit more
a little bit more credibility you know
but I'll maintain my skepticism
but that's my bias my bias is that when
it comes to
I think Homeland Security
is the closest we get to all agreeing on
stuff you know Democrats and Republicans
it's the closest we ever get and I think
that you can usually believe that your
leader is protecting the country as best
they can usually
all right
uh
is there anything else to say about that
balloon
oh and the other thing I learned which I
I guess I should have thought of it but
um
apparently you have better chance of
recovering the parts if you down in the
ocean which might have been the actual
most important part
now I'm not sure I believe that because
you've got to first of all find it at
the bottom of the ocean and second of
all the water can't help it but if it's
a ground that's not good either
you know can't imagine it in the ground
would be good so it's possible that we
had our best chance of getting their
technology
uh by by waiting until it was over water
now I don't think that the military
would say that directly would they
I mean they did say it's easier to
recover it but they did not say that's
why we waited
the the way we waited they put it in
public safety terms which is a good a
good spin on it but probably I'm going
to guess that the the higher motivation
might have been a slightly better chance
of of capturing the technology because
that would be the big win
but but keeping all the Americans safe
is good too
all right I want to give a shout out to
Van Jones for uh always being one of the
most interesting voices even when you
disagree with him
and I realize this issue has been around
a while but I just processed it so I
have something to say about it so when
the five black police officers killed
the black
citizen
a lot of people said well this one can't
be racism because they were all black
and Van Jones said that maybe it is
um
racism because black people are not
immune he said one of the sad facts
about anti-black racism is that black
people ourselves are not immune to its
pernicious effects society's message
that black people are inferior unworthy
and dangerous is pervasive
foreign
where have you ever heard a message
like in in recent years
where have you seen any message that
black people are inferior unworthy and
dangerous
I've literally never heard that
like in any context anywhere in in
modern times have you
like is he talking about just individual
racist talking on the porch or something
like where is this message I mean it's
not coming from
it's not coming from any kind of media
is it
but this could be one of those bubble
situations right
it could be that the bubble I'm in just
doesn't see it and maybe the the bubble
he's in it's just all over the place
which doesn't make my bubble better than
his bubble but this has kind of
fascinating to me
see this is why van Jones is interesting
because like I I actually feel like I
learned something when when I look at
his opinions or at least it you know
advances by you know field of perception
or something
all right let's but I got more to say
about this
um over many decades numerous
experiments have shown that these ideas
infiltrate black mines as well as white
so self-hatred is a real thing
is it again I wouldn't know
do you think blacks have a self-hatred
problem
do you think all cultures have a
self-hatred problem
yeah I don't know I guess that's that
would be invisible to me but I'll take
the claim as a a credible claim from a
credible person but it wouldn't be
something I'd be aware of
all right and then he goes on to say uh
that's why a black store owner might
regard customers of his same race
uh with suspicion while treating his
white patrons with deference black
people can Harbor anti-black sentiments
and can act on those feelings in harmful
ways
all right do you see the value in this
yet
do you see it yet all right let me let
me tease it down a little bit more van
Jones is saying that black people have a
bad feeling about let's say a stranger
in the store who happens to be black
and that that's a sign of racism
what I say is it's a sign of statistical
knowledge
it's statistics
and I think that you know
um I think van Jones is saying it fairly
directly
that as long as
black Americans have a high crime rate
that even black people will discriminate
against them
this feels like a giant step forward in
understanding each other
like it's it's sort of written as a
complaint that not only is racism so bad
you know across races but it even
includes you know within a race but I
think this moves the ball forward
because let me say something that I
never could have said out loud
but you'll understand it now because now
you have the proper context some people
clip this somebody will take this clip
out of context to cancel me you're right
so this is something that would cancel
me
but van Jones makes it safe to say
one of the things that I looked at when
I chose where where to live
I I looked at safety from natural
disasters and weather and all those
things but one of my biggest things was
not being around a high concentration of
black people
why same reason as the black store owner
right yeah my reasoning is exactly the
same as the black store owner
has nothing to do with any individual
black person
I love black people all pretty much all
of my personal experience with black
human beings is good
I love them they're fun
always have a sense of humor have
something more interesting to talk about
usually
but the truth is you can use it as a
proxy of crime
that's just a fact so the black store
owner and I are making the same decision
for the same reason it's not because we
don't like black people
that has nothing to do with anything it
has to do with it it's a good proxy for
where the crime is now if there's a
place with a high concentration of black
American citizens and it's a low crime
neighborhood I would love to know about
that because they'll give us some credit
because that would be useful too
wouldn't it wouldn't you love to know
that there are all black or let's say
predominantly black neighborhoods
in the United States who have lower than
average crime
probably such places exist I've never
heard of one have you
I assumed they exist somewhere
don't you think
so here's the thing
can we get to a more mature and advanced
understanding of this whole racism thing
and I think van Jones is is leading us
there
simply by being open to the fact that
even black people are seeing the
statistical
let's say risk reward situation and
acting on it
that's just what a lot of us do it has
nothing to do with racism it's simply a
proxy for what crime is that's all
yeah I mean you could take it to the
next level and say uh
you know do you have exactly the same
feeling when you see a uh let's say a
young black male
on a dark Street you know you're walking
down the street would you have the same
feeling as if it was a 546 black female
and the answer is no no because
so I mean they both have the same race
it's simply a statistical logical
way to be and
I don't think that I'm hurting the
conversation I think I'm helping it
because I think we have to get to the
point where we're laughing literally the
you know the back Gates approach
literally laughing at how we see each
other as racist all the time for just
everything
the the healthiest thing we can do is
accept that we're all a little bit
racist
there's nothing that could be healthier
than that because that is funny right if
you say we're all racist and we're not
proud of it
it's just funny
and then you can laugh at it when you
see it sort of mock it out of social you
know out of social consideration
so anyway again I always have high high
regard for uh Ben Jones opinions
um I would like to talk to you about
something called the documentary effect
I've decided to invent this effect maybe
it exists I didn't Google it
but I call it the documentary effect and
it's going to come in important when I
talk about the Dark Horse podcast at the
moment who was talking about me the
other day
so I have a response to that
so the documentary effect goes like this
I'll just read you the Tweet thread that
I tweeted just moments ago I said here's
an experiment you can do at home Watch
the documentary leaving Neverland that's
the one about Michael Jackson
and you will be convinced that Michael
Jackson was guilty of you know horrible
child abuse and you won't have any doubt
about it
if you watch that documentary you will
be completely convinced that he did
those terrible crimes now here's the
second part
then Google the term leaving Neverland
debunked
and immediately a whole bunch of debunks
come up and you start reading through
those and see what happens
and I can tell you what happens you will
change your mind
and a well-made documentary will be 100
persuasive to the average viewer because
only one side is presented
whenever you do a real slick
well-produced thing that only shows one
side
it's always persuasive
always it doesn't matter if it's true or
false is really persuasive
if that's all you see
well then you're done
but the debunk of the documentary will
also be a hundred percent persuasive
2 000 mules thank you good example if
you watch 2 000 mules just by itself
it is really persuasive
if you Google 2 000 mules debunked and
read what people say that have
complaints
you will be persuaded that there wasn't
necessarily anything there
they're both persuasive if you don't
understand that they're both persuasive
and 100 so
then you're not seeing the field clearly
right
um
and that's because even the debunks
now now do you believe the debunk
I want to I want to be clear on this I'm
not saying the debunk is correct
I'm saying they're both persuasive
a hundred percent
it's just like two worlds
you see them and you look at them and go
yeah I don't know how to debate that do
you look at the other one you go I don't
know how to debate that one either they
both look persuasive so here's my take
bottom line if you think you saw
something that was 100 persuasive to you
on let's say the excellent Dark Horse
podcast or any other podcast including
this one
you're right
you're right if you saw something that
you thought was 100 persuasive on the
Dark Horse podcast or any other good
podcast you're right it was 100
persuasive
doesn't mean it's right
because the debunk might be just as
persuasive
now
do you hold that to be true and do you
actually
consider that when you see content
if you when you're watching Tucker
Carlson do you say to yourself I'm only
seeing Tucker's view I'm only seeing
Tuckers for you or do you say damn
that's convincing
I think most of you would look at Tucker
and say that's 100 persuasive because it
is
it is you watch Tucker he is 100
persuasive
doesn't mean he's right
how would I know
probably most of the time
maybe sometimes how would I know
I wouldn't know
but I know he's persuasive
and I know that if I turn to CNN and see
them talking to the other side I know
that I'll think huh it looks pretty good
all right so just keep in mind
the things that are not true are 100
persuasive have I made that point will
you all accept the things that are not
true
can look 100 persuasive if you just see
the one story all right so just keep
that in mind that's your primer for the
rest of this
so I watched uh Brett Weinstein Heather
or higher talking about my opinions on
uh who got things right during the
pandemic
and they made some uh points
about uh and specifically the question
was were they right
more right than other people were they
more right than other people because
they had a better process
and uh and then I asked the question can
you teach me the process
and then they talked about why that was
Impractical right so
my expertise is not a science as you
know
so I can't really judge anything they
say about the science would you agree
would you agree that I am incapable of
judging the science independently
yeah I could listen to what they say and
other people but I don't have this skill
to independently look at the science
all right
so
but here's the skill I do have
here's a skill I do have I can recognize
cognitive dissonance in the wild
so I'm going to tell you the the Tells
for cognitive distance that the Dark
Horse podcast uh Heather and Brett
displayed
all right now you be the judge
and watch how persuasive this is
and if I persuade you that they're
hallucinating
and you're 100 persuaded
what should be your opinion when you
leave this live stream
that is true
no because you're only seeing my
presentation
my presentation is going to be super
persuasive
it might be right I think it is but I
always think I am right that doesn't
mean I am
so watch out persuasive I am
you ready
all right here's the first tell
um Heather described that my problem is
in all likelihood
that while even though I'm the Dilbert
guy and they they acknowledge that I
might be bright in my own domain
so even though I'm a bright Dilbert guy
Dilbert creating guy who definitely
doesn't trust management which she
acknowledged my problem was that I did
trust the scientists
so I had an over simplified trust in
science
which they as scientists could confirm
is too much trust that science is a
messy process in which you're wrong for
a long time sometimes until you're
finally right and that you can spend a
lot of time in the wrong area until you
crawl toward the truth with a variety of
scientific systems and processes
now
does that sound like mind reading to you
how could anybody judge my personal uh
Trust of scientists
and why would you assume that I'm smart
and I don't trust managers
but that somehow I didn't think to
extend that to other professionals
well first of all I do I'm mock
scientists all the time and I say out
loud as often as you'll listen to it
that I don't believe the data I don't
believe the scientists but here's what
they're saying and that you shouldn't
believe them necessarily and that none
of the data is credible
so I've said that none of the data from
the mainstream scientists I find
100 persuasive but also I'm so much of a
skeptic I also don't believe the
Skeptics
so I'm twice as skeptical
as the scientists themselves
but her take was that I somehow had not
noticed the scientists can be biased by
money and stuff
now here's the second point
she she makes the point that and I think
Brett made it well that scientists can
be biased by money
do you think I didn't know that
there's anybody who thinks that I wasn't
aware the scientists are biased by money
it's like the most basic thing that an
adult knows
but then
why would a podcaster
be immune from that effect
now the usual argument is that they they
lost money in Fame and stuff but once
you're a podcaster
and let me let me back up here
um I should create a little base of
uh let's say better Behavior
I think that uh Brett and Heather and a
lot of the other podcasters who are
let's say contrarians
are super useful like Society needs more
Brett and Heather
do you agree
like if we had more of them we'd all be
a better world right so I want to I want
to be clear because I'm going to say
some things that sound critical but they
were they were very professional and I
thought unusually uh forgiving
for my uh my attitudes
I was actually impressed at how how
professionally they handled what could
be seen as criticism so a big
big uh compliment to both of them for
being consistently good let's say Goods
good representatives of science
and good representatives of mature
behavior in General on you know online
and you know I don't have either of
those qualities so these are sincere
compliments
that said
back to my point once you start a
podcast
which is notable for being the
contrarian View
what you gonna do
basically as soon as you start the
podcast you become as biased as all the
people you're uh
you're criticizing and there's no way
around that
because you know even though they may
have lost money or some kinds of you
know reputation or something overall
once you're in the podcast contrarian
world
what are you going to do all right so
yeah it's the Alex Berenson effect once
you become branded as the person who
disagrees with the standard statements
it's hard to feel
that you don't have any bias in that
situation right now
I think that they would have been more
credible to call that out that everybody
has their own bias including me of
course
there's nobody who doesn't have bias
and if you think that the you know
there's some scientists for their money
have a greater bias than somebody who
does a podcast in which getting it right
is the most important thing who would
watch their podcast if they got stuff
wrong
you wouldn't watch it long well maybe
you would Alex Jones in some cases
so
all right so the other thing that Brett
said is that the way that you can tell
that they're doing something right is
that they got eight out of ten things
right this sort of you know not an exact
score but sort of generally 80 of what
they got right and those are based on
predictions
now is that a good standard
suppose the only thing you knew is that
they got 80 percent of their
uh predictions right
that's that's good right
so you'd you'd give much higher
credibility to somebody who got 80
percent of their predictions right
wouldn't you
okay
so here's some questions for you
who did the scoring
who scored their predictions correct
well they did
do they have any bias
yeah yeah could you name somebody else
who got eight out of 10 predictions
right about the pandemic
can you
me
yeah me do you know why I got I'm sure I
got 80 of my predictions right
because I scored it
I literally created a document and said
here are all the things I got right
here's what I got wrong I scored it
so
if if Brett and Heather and I have
different opinions
and we both got 80 according to our own
scoring
who do you who do you believe
we both had the same record according to
our own scoring
now could there be a less scientific
point of view
then I got 80 right according to my own
scoring just like everybody else scored
their own their own predictions is there
anybody here who didn't think they were
right 80 of the time
I'll bet everyone here
believes their own predictions about the
pandemic were 80 or better right right
so I should believe every one of you
even if you have different opinions
because you all got 90 of everything
right
okay
so
I would consider that super unscientific
and they tell for a cognitive dissonance
because well there's no question
there's no question
that Brett and Heather are statistically
uh high high capability right compared
to the average person so certainly they
would understand what I'm saying just as
easily as you all do right so in order
for them to be you know hyper scientific
rational people which they are
uh for them to think that that was a
good point
did they get there by good scientific
rational thinking no it's it's a tell
for cognitive distance because if
somebody's an expert in something and
says something that's clearly completely
ridiculous within their own profession
because there's no scientists that would
agree with that
right do you think any scientist if I
just pull them aside and said look they
scored their own predictions 80 percent
and so did everybody else they scored
their own predictions eighty percent
so would we believe this one what
scientists would agree with that
statement
nobody right so I think that's a tell so
you've got the mind reading tell not
only did Heather and maybe Brett I don't
know but not only did Heather imagine
that I trusted scientists which is
literally the opposite of everything
I've ever said in my entire life
publicly
that's a ridiculous belief
but it seemed logical you know within
their their structure I guess
all right here's another one
um
well also on the 8 out of 10 do you
remember that I said that somebody was
going to be right about it and
everything because we all have different
predictions
somebody was going you know even if you
take away the subjective scoring of your
yourself
somebody was going to be right in 10
times
because a lot of people made a lot of
predictions in public
so the existence of somebody who was
Right Aid and attend means
nothing
nothing because it was guaranteed
because of a large group of people
making lots of different predictions
chance alone guarantees
guarantees that somebody would have Aid
in an attempt if you have a big enough
population which we did
all right um then the most telling I
think was when they were trying to
explain why they couldn't explain how
they got it right
now that's the part that I would
definitely ask you to look at
here's what it looks like when you don't
have cognitive dissonance all right so
I'll pretend to be Brett or Heather
and not have cognitive dissonance
and then Scott says to them so can you
show me how you got it right
here here's a non-cognitive dissonance
sensor well to be honest every situation
is different so I wouldn't generalize
this to you know every other decision
however there were four key variables
that we looked at that we had a
different take on because we have
greater knowledge about evolutionary
biology
and if you knew evolutionary biology you
could look at these four things I'm just
making this upright it's just an example
you can look at these four things
through that lens and it would be really
clear
now I wouldn't understand that
but I would say well that's somebody who
knows what they're doing
but suppose instead they say well it's
really hard because it's a complicated
systems on systems and it's hard to say
in any given situation what would be the
one way to go because that would be
oversimplifying so really you have to
understand the entire field and we have
a we have sort of a field that is good
at understanding other fields so it
gives us a better vision of it but
really it's like archery if somebody was
an excellent Archer
could they explain it to you in a way
that you could do it
now what what do I say when people
resort to analogies
they don't have an argument right
so
if you went to me and said hey Archer
can you teach me how to Archer if the
Archer was not in cognitive dissonance
here's the answer well you would need
two things one is apparently I have some
genetic gifts that make me good at this
on top of that I practiced in a very
disciplined way and here's how I
practiced now you probably couldn't
produce this if you don't have the
natural ability but if you did and you
followed this same process I'm confident
you would get to the same result and be
a great Archer too
now is there anything in that answer
that's confusing
it's very easy to explain how an Archer
became good at archery
it's just that you can't do it
and likewise had they not been
experiencing cognitive dissonance it
would have been really easy to say well
Scott you forgot this variable and this
one and we have some knowledge about
this area so it stood down to us
that's what I was looking for but if you
get instead complications about
complication it's really hard to say and
what about archery that's cognitive
Distance by the way would you have
recognized that would you have
recognized that as cognitive dissonance
all right
and then I'm going to double whiteboard
you
I'm double whiteboarding you
here it comes
suppose you say to me but Scott
um you got to listen to the smart
scientists because they have better
arguments and you can tell by looking to
them can I so you get all these
scientists who are saying things and
let's say the dark dark horse podcast
got it right
so so let's let's take that as an
assumption so let's say they got
everything right
but it's different
from what lots of other scientists said
what what skill would I employ to know
that they got it right
I'll tell you what skill I would employ
I would deploy an illusion
called the documentary effect
and I would say to myself when I listen
to that podcast
that sounds a hundred percent persuasive
and then I'm done
and if I went to these other people
maybe they don't have a podcast maybe
they're not as persuasive maybe I heard
something on the Dark Horse podcast that
biased me to thinking these people are
wrong but the truth is we have no tools
you and I
to know that this was right
it might be right
might be right every time I have no
tools to know that because I can't
independently do what they do and they
can't explain it in a way that I could
do it
so it doesn't help me that they're right
their rightness has no value
whatsoever because I can't confirm it
and I can't get any sense of whether
it's right by looking at
now but when I but when I listen to them
doing mind reading
it does bias me in One Direction
now here's the other thing that's
inconvenient
as Brett and Heather also describe very
well science is a process of moving
toward the truth so you never really
know if you're there you know you think
Newton got gravity right until Einstein
comes along and says well that's only in
certain situations that's right
so you're wrong wrong wrong wrong but if
you do everything right
you don't know how long it'll take
because it would be a different
different length of time for any
specific issue but eventually maybe you
start locking into it you're correct
here's my question for science
how do how do Brett and Heather know
where they are on this line
how do they know they're there
is it because the the current data
uh agrees with him
how often does the data turn out to be
wrong
all the time
like all the time
something like 50 of peer-reviewed
papers end up not reproducible 50
percent
somebody said 90 percent of
meta-analysis is wrong
90 percent
so Brett and Heather
say that they have achieved something
like
you know closer to truth because he then
attend predictions
is a pretty good indicator of Truth
but I say there is no way to know where
you are on the line
and you spend 90 percent of your time
wrong
and ten percent of your time right if
you get a guess and you don't know
anything else are you going to guess
that an individual scientist
is in the 90 of the time they're wrong
or by luck and it would be luck
did you did you pick the one point they
they're in the 10 when they got things
right
how do you know where you are
let let's say uh Brett and Heather are
uh excellent scientists and they appear
to me I mean they're both published they
got books they're high profile they look
like they know what they're doing
but
how do they know where they are
how does anybody know that
I'm watching your comments and I love it
when
you're thinking
because it's a whole different kind of
comment I can tell now you're processing
this aren't you
all right
uh
so
my my expertise says that they uh are
exhibiting
uh all the Tells for cognitive
dissonance how many how many except my
uh
my interpretation
that they couldn't know if they're right
they couldn't know if their predictions
will work next time they can't explain
their con their process and I understand
that it might be complicated
um
and their mind reading they're mind
reading me in a ridiculous way
doesn't it look like cognitive distance
now let's say I I persuaded you and
you're 100 persuaded should you believe
it
no don't believe me don't believe me
because that's the documentary fact so I
just did to you
what they did to you
I showed you one side
and it's persuasive
that's all I want I so if you're if what
you're taking away from this is Scott's
right and they're wrong nope that's the
wrong lesson wrong lesson
here's the right lesson
if you only hear one side of it it'll be
really persuasive to you so don't
believe that
never believe something that's
persuasive on one side
all right let's talk about Kyle Becker
at a gray thread you should you should
all be filing the following Kyle Becker
on Twitter he has great threads
uh scoops and stuff like that stuff you
don't see other places
but
he did a thread on the Biden crime
family that's my term for it and in my
opinion once you see all the evidence
the things we know not the things we're
speculating
the things we know the hunter did the
money we know that was transferred the
people who transferred it
it's a hundred percent obvious that say
Biden crime family and has been for a
long time does anybody disagree with
that
Katie
trolls are here
goodbye
yeah
um
so doesn't it make you wonder
why they haven't been arrested already
do you wonder why they why they haven't
been arrested
so here's what I think is going on
the the Biden crime family narrative is
so well documented
so obvious that I treat it as a fact
do you
I treat it as an established fact and
there are a lot of things in the news I
don't treat as facts because I don't
think the evidence suggests that yet but
I treat that as a fact it's just so well
documented
um
here's the dumbest comment of the day L
Carey sorry Scott you were clueless if
you didn't know Spike proteins was toxic
when you got jabbed
I just did like a whole presentation
about how I don't know science
did you listen to any of that
how about Scott doesn't know how to do
Fusion
well it's true I don't all right let me
get back to my point
um I think what's going on
is Craig Chamberlain on Twitter said
this he goes quote it's so obvious and
bad that it borders on parity
uh it seems like it's the growing
defense and I believe that something is
going on here with our perception of the
bidens
I believe our brains are broken like
collectively
because we can see it's just obvious
that it's a criminal Enterprise running
our our government it's obvious
yet nothing is happening about it
you can't reconcile those two things I
your brain cannot reconcile it's obvious
a major criminal thing
and nothing's happening
so you have to pick
well
maybe it's not important if nothing's
happening
but wait it's obviously important
but nothing's happening
so maybe other people who know things
think it's not important
and so your brain can't handle that
your brain is actually in a state of
abdication you basically give up you're
beaten down
so they've actually
um beaten down the public to where they
can do a major crime in public
and you won't act
that's where you actually are
they can do the crime right in front of
you and you won't act
because you're you're just stunned
because none of it makes sense
so that we're basically gaslighted into
complete inactivity and also in
blindness in some case and the blindness
would be in the case of mostly Democrats
who could easily see it
but they're not reading any Kyle Becker
threads
you know how many Democrats are
following Kyle Becker
zero
same with me probably
yeah the the thing about the prosecutor
fired I'm not sure that I don't know if
that's the most important part of the
story but it could be
um so it's the ultimate Gaslight the
Biden crime family
just exists and nothing's going to
happen and we'll just have to deal with
that I guess
because if something did happen it would
be big
all right
um
and then oh just one other thing about
the dark course podcast I I didn't see
anywhere on the podcast where they
mentioned how they determined the long
coveted risk have they ever talked about
that
because what the the thing I finally
figured out is it all comes down to that
I tried to figure out why so many smart
people were disagreeing with me but when
you dig down and you you match
assumptions it always comes down to the
people who disagreed on vaccinations
uh were people who thought the Long Cove
at risk was neither zero
or they didn't think about it so it's to
me the biggest variable and the people
who have different opinions than I did
they uh just ignore it they just ignore
the biggest variable and by ignore it I
mean some just say I knew it was nothing
so that's guessing
so if if and I don't know if this is the
case so you'll have to confirm but if
it's the case
that Brett and Heather did like the
greatest job of all time
looking at the you know the details of
the vaccinations and the harm and all
that but if they didn't also suss out
the lorem covered risk or they treated
it like an unknown
you're still guessing
if the biggest variable is unknown
you're guessing there's just no way
around that
now I guess there is a way around it if
you had some heuristic rule of thumb
that could handle it but there isn't is
a totally novel situation
all right
but let me let me close this by saying
that the uh
the value and the beauty if I will say
that of the Dark Horse podcast is that
they're they're enriching the
conversation
and they're perfectly compatible with
science
in the sense that they're acknowledging
you don't know everything at every Point
you're crawling toward the truth you're
you're adjusting your assumptions the
more you see of that the better off we
are
right
Michael's store Scott didn't think
logically he just got scared and rushed
down to get a cloud shot
now Michael
do you think that that might be mind
reading
and a clear signal that you're in
cognitive distance
because do you think you could read my
mind and know what I'm afraid of
do you think that's a thing
and shouldn't I be uh let's say
fully fully accounting for all my risks
yeah I think everybody who thinks that
somebody acted just on fear
you're not really a useful member of the
conversation all right I've got a uh
I've got a hypothesis here
that will really make you mad you ready
you ready to be mad
hypothesis coming
and now this is not a one-for-one
situation I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about
averages but I'm not talking about you
individually right so don't tell me what
you individually feel
that would be misunderstanding my point
so I'll beg you I'm only doing this
because I know you can't resist I'm
going to beg you not to tell me your
personal situation
and you'll you'll still have to do it
all right I'm begging you do not put in
the comments what you personally think
and did see if you can resist
here's my hypothesis
people who are afraid of needles were
more likely to be against the coven shut
I'll just look at your comments I'm
going to see who's the first one to
who's the first one
it was the first one
you know you can't resist
come on come on
okay you're doing pretty good I was
expecting somebody to say I'm not a
shark I'm not afraid of that thing and
therefore your theory is wrong
how much would you bet on it
I'll put an actual monetary bet
that if you did I don't know if you
could do a good enough study I never
trust studies so I don't know if there's
any way to collect on the bat but I
would bet a large amount
that the people who are afraid of
needles just in general were far more
likely
you know but when I say far more likely
it might be like a 20 effect you know
not 100 effect but like a real solid 20
effect or something like that that
people now the reason I say that
oh oh
um I'm not afraid of needles
so consistent with my hypothesis I'm not
afraid of kneels
so I put it off as long as I could
you know so I can know as much as
possible but when it was time to get the
needle I never even thought about it
but
I know myself
and if I were deathly afraid of needles
which is a big thing
some people are if I were afraid of
needles I'm sure I would be more against
these needles I'm sure I would because I
know myself I know I would be biased by
that
I think it's I think that applies to
everybody
you know any knowledge of psychology
well let me put it this way
let's see in the comments
only the people who have a education in
Psychology because there are always some
psychologists and you know cognitive
scientists and stuff right so you have
to tell me you're a scientist or a
psychologist
so say I'm a psychologist and then your
answer
if you're a psychologist do you agree
with me that the people afraid of
needles are more likely to say they
don't work
go just the people who are experts in
Psychology but say what your expertise
is
data scientist yes
how much more likely maybe 20 percent
psychology yes scientist yes right so
basically everybody who has
um right I'm a Psychiatry resident agree
right Clinical Psychology yes a welder
yes
I give credit to a welder yes uh all
right
right psychologists 75 Cypress said yes
I'll take 75 percent
yeah now it's definitely not a hundred
percent
it's not like it's not like every person
is afraid of needles right it's just
like a 20 bias would be my best guess
and there's a lot of guessing all right
all right ladies and gentlemen
I believe I have delivered to you once
again
some unique and provocative views that
you have not seen
um and that's why you watch this
live stream
and I will tell you again do I know that
I'm right about everything of course not
do I know that uh that I will predict
better than the Dark Horse podcast on
the next thing we predict nope nope
they're smart people
if you bet against the black horse
podcast
maybe a bad bat that might be a Bad Bet
because they've got they've got skills
right they got real skills they have a
real process they have real experience
and they're credible people
so I wouldn't bet against them but
knowing that somebody's right is tough
that's tough
all right and that's all for today for
YouTube and I'm going to talk to the
locals people for a little bit because
they're special
bye for now
