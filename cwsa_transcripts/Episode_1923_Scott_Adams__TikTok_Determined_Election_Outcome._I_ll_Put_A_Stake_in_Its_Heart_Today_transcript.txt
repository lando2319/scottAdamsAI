morning ladies and gentlemen
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization and if you were a
subscriber on the locals platform
under the Scott Adams Community you
would have heard a cool little behind
the scenes snippet
that they're all excited about but
they're never going to tell you no you'd
have to be a subscriber now let's say
you'd like to take this experience up a
notch and I'm going to blow your
minds today are you ready for this
today isn't going to be normal there's
something this could happen today you
could you're going to see it from the
beginning
but uh to get you ready for that I think
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker cellices Diana canteen
geographlask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure that doped me to
the day the thing makes everything
better it's cold the simultaneous Sip
and it tastes way better than an
official mug go
ah good thank you Craig
foreign
barely MSNBC is talking this morning
about the possibility of fetterman
running for president someday because
he's such a strong candidate
uh no that actually happened
no no I'm not joking
no seriously
now is it my imagination or does anybody
else
watch MSNBC for the comedy
that's literally why I watch it I would
never turn on MSNBC for anything but a
laugh
am I right and I'm not this is not
hyperbole
I'm not it's not just a clever way to
insult them it's not even an insult it's
like actually a fact
I turn on MSNBC because I know I'm going
to have a laugh
does anybody else do that
am I or other people do that right now
that's not even a political statement
if I watch if I watch CNN let's say
today they've moved more to the middle
does CNN make me laugh
today when when they're more mainstream
no never I never laugh I often will
disagree with the people on there but
I'm not laughing at them right
am I right but MSNBC you turn that on
you and you can't you can't help but
laugh
is so ridiculous and they're so in a
different world anyway
um
in my opinion
America just had one of its best weeks
ever
but I feel like we we just get so caught
in every little drama and problem that
you miss it like you missed the forest
for the trees sort of thing let me
describe what the best week in America
looks like
it looks like a midterm election where
people were very engaged
very engaged
and turnout was excellent
and I think they were reasonably well
informed compared to you know what they
usually are and
they fixed the government
[Laughter]
the thing that we all wanted was a
little less government wasn't it and so
they they just blocked up the government
so it's going to be some kind of a
deadlocked hard to get anything done
situation
that you know it feels to me
it feels to me like we got what we
needed
which is
not not complete inactivity
but we're forcing the government to be
less uh partisan because they won't be
able to do anything just nothing
unless they agree with each other a
little bit
so I feel like this was exactly the
thing we needed
and what else happened was we're not
bitching about the the Integrity of the
election as much as you know we might
expect we're still talking about Arizona
but that's a wait and see
wait and see might turn out fine
honestly this is one of the best weeks
America's ever had it really is because
we're we're airing out all of our
problems it's what we do best
Americans bitching about Americans is
our best look
that's why we're that's why we do well
because we're never happy we're like ah
we can do better than that ah we can do
better than that ah we can do better
than that it's just it's just our
permanent condition
but man you give me you give me an
election that people trust from so far
so far they trust it
give me an election people are just and
and an outcome that the people really
did want they did want the government to
act like a government and they just
forced them into it
we just forced them to cooperate now
will this work I don't know I don't know
might not work but it was what we needed
to try right
it I I don't think this could have been
better
everybody's a little bit unhappy aren't
they
do you know what a good business deal
looks like it's when everybody's a
little bit unhappy I didn't get
everything I wanted
this was perfect
if you were if you were to be non-uh
partisan just for a moment just just
imagine yourself just an observer who
doesn't care you know which way it goes
the system is really strong
the system is really strong it didn't
even it didn't even didn't even buckle
so that's pretty impressive
all right
um and I would argue that even the
Badness we're seeing in Arizona with the
late vote count and the machines
breaking do you think that's all bad
is it bad that Arizona literally just
embarrassed itself in front of the whole
country
nope nope that's how stuff gets changed
Arizona finally crossed the line from a
little bit of a problem to what the
are you guys doing
right
that's a big line everything was like
well that could be better no we're not
talking about that could be a little bit
better
we're not talking about oh nobody saw
that problem coming we all saw it coming
we all know how to fix it
and and now the spotlight is on this one
 piece of garbage
you know management of a system and
we're not going to stand for it
perfect
perfect we isolated the worst problem
we're putting all of our energy and
hatred on it and we're going to change
it it'll probably get better it might
take you know Kerry Lake getting elected
but
it's all good
here's more good news uh Corey DeAngelis
let's give him a a big hand for the
school choice thing
um topic being as prominent as it has
been apparently as he's reporting in
Texas 10 out of 15 spots on the state
school board appear to be going to
Republicans
uh
so apparently the the school choice
approach was a winner
and you know Corey is the biggest name
behind that so great job great job he
actually turned that topic into an
actual politically
um potent topic that's as good as you
can do I mean you can't do better than
it mattered right like it caused an
election to go a different way
that's good
so that's happened in the right
direction
um I saw a lot of people confused or
angry about the thing the fact that
everything is going the wrong way 75 of
the country thinks say things are going
the wrong way and then we re-elected
almost all of the incumbents
does anybody find that confusing
75 percent think things are going wrong
but we re-elected all the incumbents
most of them
now that makes perfect sense
and there's two reasons one is everybody
thinks that the problem is not their
person
well I'm a Democrat and my
representative is a Democrat so the
problem isn't my state I like my person
but those other states those other
states should do different something
differently to fix things
so I think I think there's no mystery
just it's team play people think their
own incumbent is the good one and part
of that part of the problem
is that the length of time you've served
in Congress gets you more power
sure that's a good system is it
because you're you're willing to
re-elect your fossils because they've
been there a long time so they have
power
you know they have committee seats and
stuff
I don't know I'm sure there's a benefit
to it but I don't know what it is
obviously
yeah all right well Joel Pollock seemed
uh seems to be one of the few people who
uh is noticing maybe the biggest thing
that happened in the midterms that I'd
completely missed I think Kyle Becker
noted it as well in a tweet that the
Republicans won six more six million
more votes than the Democrats did it's
just they weren't in the right place
they were in the wrong place the Red
Wave it happened
the Red Wave absolutely happened
so all of those polls you saw this had
the Republicans are going to win by you
know five or six percent or something
I forget what rasmussen's final generic
poll thing was but I think the generic
poll at Rasmussen was right about
exactly where it came out
can somebody do a fact check on that
because they were hovering around that
five or six percent range
and that's exactly what it was
I I think they got it exactly the
trouble was that doesn't translate into
what people are doing in specific places
you know because that has to do with the
the funding and the exact you know the
exact candidate and all that stuff
so weirdly weirdly the Red Wave totally
happened it just didn't matter
uh
you know and uh so you read more about
that in Breitbart Joel Pollock writes
about that
um but I feel like that's one of the
biggest
conceptual facts that we all needed to
understand to figure out what happened
can we now say that the Democrats
outplayed the Republicans in this
election
would you say that just in terms of
legal completely legal
uh decisions about how to phrase it how
to how to fund it
I would say yes I would say yes
uh no we'll talk about abortion but
um I'm going to say that the Democrats
were more capable
I thought that I think they had they did
a better election
everybody agrees right and it's hard for
us to say that isn't it because most of
you are leaning right but I feel like we
can criticize ourselves
it's not me I'm not a republican but but
I but I but it's I'm glad to see I'm
glad to see that you're all willing to
say okay that's on us
that's so Republican
that is so Republican of you
at least you're consistent right
you know what what's the thing I like
best about conservatives
they own their
that's what I like best right even if I
could disagree with you on 50 different
things you own your
that's big it's a big thing
all right uh let's see
here are all the reasons given for why
uh the Red Wave didn't work out the way
a lot of people thought
uh by the way there were people who did
predict there would be no red wave
right I'm one who did not expect a red
wave uh Geraldo I think was one
can you confirm that I believe Heraldo
was calling no red wave
did you see that or no am I
misremembering that
I'm trying to uh surface the people you
should listen to next time
Hannity too
did he
yeah uh Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell
was smart he said candidate quality will
determine the Senate yeah
funding too but that's obvious
yeah okay
uh
uh oh yeah Geraldo about Jesse Waters a
thousand dollars on the Red Wave and one
right and Heraldo won that all right I'm
only saying that because I I always see
a lot of anti-heraldo
uh comments on my feed
and I feel like I feel like Geraldo is
like a National Treasure
because he's capable of playing on both
sides and he does both sides exuberantly
right it's all fully transparent I feel
I feel like we need more of him not less
and I love the fact that he took the uh
you know opening that safe who was it Al
Capone's safe I love the fact that that
didn't hurt him like he's an energy
monster
more energy more better you just went
with it no embarrassment at all I love
that about him
uh he's one of my favorite people I have
to say
um
so here here are reasons why Republicans
didn't do as well
how many of you think Lindsey Graham was
an idiot for pushing abortion hard when
he did
now my understanding is he just sort of
automatically
does that same bill every year or
something
so I think he was just sort of on
autopilot saying I do this all the time
I'm just going to try it again
but
I feel like it was a huge mistake wasn't
it I don't know what percentage of
of the outcome we can attribute to that
now on on one hand
it was also transparent and honest
right it what he did was transparent he
was asking for what he wanted
he was honest you know there was no
trick to it it's what he wanted and he
was consistent
he was transparent honest and consistent
but strategically
maybe not that perfect so that could
have mattered
in some cases there were bad candidates
as
you know as we all talk about phentermen
Etc but I think the candidate quality
disappears when the election is so close
that that one candidate will determine
who controls you know Congress right so
so I think candidate equality only
matters
when it's not that close
um
team play people just voted for their
team how important was that that's
always the Baseline
so I mean that's team team voting is
going to explain 95 of every election
you know you're only playing with the
five percent that are willing to to
change
all right how about this uh
uh apparently the Democrats were 100
successful in funding the least viable
candidates on the other side in the
primaries you know that was their trick
right they intentionally uh promoted the
worst Republican candidates in the
primaries so once it became the general
election their candidate was running
against the worst of all the
Alternatives and apparently that worked
every time
did you can you fact check me on that my
understanding is it worked every time
it's actually a really good strategy in
in hindsight it's a good strategy
because in the primaries it doesn't take
much money
that that's sort of cheap
you know the primaries so if you can get
that worse person you know over the line
you're done
you're done
so I think that was part of it and I
would put that in the category of the
Democrats that outplayed the Republicans
again
yeah I'm going to give the Republic the
Democrats a full
full compliment they ran a good election
um how about this
uh we talked about the Red Wave it
happened but it wasn't in the right
places so that would suggest that the
that suggests the Democrats have funded
the right places and the Republicans
probably funded the wrong places
now I'm not sure that's true because
it's a little more complicated than that
but it suggests that
um
we're also hearing that the GOP did not
have a positive message about changing
things
that's both true and false at the same
time
because I feel like the GOP brand is so
clean
like they're so consistent that do you
ever have to ask what their plan is
do you is there somebody who didn't know
the GOP likes to reduce taxes
is there somebody who wonders if the GOP
is big on fossil fuels and all energy
you know when we need it
is there somebody who thinks that the
GOP is ambivalent about wokeness
but why do you even have to ask what the
GOP plan is
it was Trump
everything Trump did just do that again
the the clearest cleanest message of all
time is what do the Republicans plan to
do
am I right and I heard them getting
criticized for not having a positive
plan now it's true it's true they didn't
talk about their positive plan but it's
definitely not true they they don't have
one their plan is so amazingly clear
that I don't know how you can miss it
but you could argue the same thing about
the Democrats yeah the the general plan
is pretty clear
all right
um
so those are possibilities in the
comments which of those do you think are
the biggest ones uh abortion quality of
the candidates the team play thing of
course you don't have to say that one
because team plays is of course the big
one but what's the second biggest one
the Dems funding the worst people the
Red Wave being in the wrong place
funding the wrong places I guess and GOP
not having a positive message give me
your opinion in the comments
I'll just read them off as I come I'm
seeing abortion the most right
yeah
somebody's saying ballot harvesting and
mail-in ballots
Maybe
um which is you know everything's legal
if you're uh ballot harvesting in the
right places it's legal
so most of you think abortion
right how many of you didn't see that
coming
I'll tell you my point of view I don't
think I said it out loud but
correct me if I ever said this out loud
but when I saw the Supreme Court ruling
against Roe and then I saw Lindsey
Graham doing his you know attempt at uh
legislation on abortion I said to myself
you just threw away all of your
advantage
I I thought the Republicans threw away
everything
I thought it was years of work and they
just flushed it down the toilet right in
front of all of us that's what I thought
so to me the election went exactly the
way it should have
that's the way it should have right if
your party makes a mistake that big and
it doesn't affect the election I don't
know what to think
that looked like the biggest most
obvious mistake anybody ever made
like you that I think that was one for
the ages now the Supreme Court you
couldn't help right the Supreme Court's
on its own on its own schedule can't
help that but
the Lindsey Graham thing was such a
an obvious self-owned that I don't know
it's hard to hard to explain it but but
let me give him a compliment
he was honest consistent and has a moral
standard that he's pursuing
I don't hate that but strategically bad
all right now I'm going to tell you the
real answer
uh you're all wrong
all of those all those reasons you gave
they're all wrong
who made the difference
who made the difference in the election
what demographic group dominated the
result
young people of what kind unmarried
women young unmarried women were the
dominant full okay
um and those young unmarried women they
were getting their news from Fox News
Fox news is that where they're watching
were they watching television news
were the young single women watching a
lot of television
getting their news from television
about Twitter
is mostly male by the way can somebody
give me a a demographic on that Twitter
is mostly male right
so what would be a large media
kind of a platform that young women tend
to gravitate towards more than other
people
yeah
you see it
tick tock
Tick Tock is the primary communication
to young single women
it's owned by China
do any of you use tick tock
here's a question have you ever seen
anything on Tick Tock about border
security
border security
it's all over Tick Tock isn't it nope
probably never seen it
uh now I'm not on Tick Tock so I have to
ask this question first of all how many
of you are on Tick Tock are there enough
people watching here that you could even
answer this question
yeah I want to see some yeses any Tick
Tock people
a lot of no's
all right my my audience doesn't overlap
with Tick Tock much
all right so I don't know if any of you
know this but how many how many Tick
Tock users have seen a abortion related
tick tock anybody have you seen any
abortion communication on tick tock
say yeses right
now you know who owns Tick Tock right
everybody knows China is a Chinese
company which means the Chinese
government can tell this company to do
anything they want
anything with the algorithm
you see it right
the the the the the group of Americans
that controlled the election outcome
are the group of Americans that China
controls through tiktok
do you find that a coincidence
this is exactly what I've been telling
you was going to happen
just as just as when Lindsey Graham did
the abortion thing I said uh-oh
Republicans are obviously
obviously they're and they are
and they were
right
allowing Tick Tock a Chinese company
controlled by China to be the primary
channel for the most important group of
Voters in the United States
do you see any problem there
and that thing is still legal
that thing is still legal and it
will stay legal as long as Democrats
find an advantage in it because at this
point it's working for them
so the Democrats have no reason to take
China's influence out of the election
because it's the same as theirs it
matches
now
would you accept the following uh the
following as fact
fact China owns tick tock
fact Tick Tock decides what you see
fact the biggest group of people in
America watching Tick Tock are young
single women
fact they determine the election is
there anything else I need to tell you
why is Tick Tock still alive today
why is Tick Tock if you why is that app
still work in America why am I the only
one who noticed
am I the only one who noticed
did you see this in the news
who mentioned it besides me did you once
see this in the news
did you
no it wasn't in the news do you
know why
don't
I don't but I'll tell you what you're
gonna see it's gonna be in the
news today
yeah I'm gonna drive a steak through
tick tock's heart
I'm going to use this
because you can't ignore this can you
once you hear it you can't ignore it but
until you heard it you can ignore it you
know maybe you didn't connect the dots
but people the the signal is glaring
this is not the hint of a suggestion of
maybe something could go wrong
it's not
this is something already went
wrong right in front of you it
controlled the entire fate of
the country
and China did that
China did that as long as you look do
you on on the locals platform I taught
them a lesson about cognitive blindness
it's what magicians do is you know one
of their one of their techniques and
cognitive blindness is where you talk
about one thing
and then people's minds enter that frame
and once they're in a certain frame
they're blind to things that are
completely obvious
you could easily see it but your your
mental frame just moved off of it for a
moment
that's what's Happening Here
if if your frame was correct you would
say who controlled the election young
women where do they get their news China
is there anything else to flocking say
about it
is there any complexity to it is there
anything confusing
do you see anything confusing
no
this is not confusing this is China it's
they're influencing our elections they
just decided who runs our Congress
now suppose you say to me Scott Scott
that's hyperbole we do not have proof
that they consciously affected our
elections
big deal
they just showed they can
they just show they can
and you're not going to stop it now I
don't even care if they did or didn't
because I actually like I like the
result of the midterms they may have
helped us out it may have been a favor
in Disguise but
yeah because I like our you know our our
inactive Congress but so do they
so do they I think they like our
inactive Congress too
now ask yourself if you're if you're
elected representatives are going to do
anything about this
if they don't you don't have any
elective Representatives you just have
elective
a neglective representative would get
rid of Tick Tock tomorrow
but these are just elected
right an elected
just has to
so that's all you'll say you're just
seeing them you know get elected and
 kill Tick Tock we could not be
more obvious or more bipartisan well I
suppose it's not bipartisan if one side
likes it but it should be it should be
bipartisan
show me one person who disagrees
smoothly anybody in the comments you
agree you disagree with almost
everything I say some of you right shall
be one person who disagrees with
us
nobody
nobody
not one person
and you're not going to see any action
on this today I predict you'll see some
news on it but I'll bet you won't
obey you won't
you're not going to see any government
action you're not going to see any
Senator say oh let's put this at the top
of the list
you're not going to see anybody
I don't know why exactly but you're not
going to see it
all right
um
let's talk about uh fentanyl also coming
from China through the cartels now
um do you know why we're not giving
Ukraine our best weapons this will tie
back to fentanyl why are we not giving
Ukraine our best stuff
Biden said that we have these high Mar
systems there are two types one will go
600 miles
and we're not giving Ukraine that kind
because that would allow them to attack
inside of Russia but we're giving them
the 60 mile type
so they can you know do defensive stuff
near their border
so why does Ukraine not get the good
stuff
the answer is because there's a price
tag on it
Putin put the price on it he said if you
give them the good stuff it's nuclear
war
now maybe he's bluffing maybe he's not
but he put a price on him right so we
said whoa that price is too high
what's what's the price of giving them
the 60 mile stuff
and Putin says well I'll fight really
hard against the ukrainians and we say
okay
that that price is acceptable and then
we send you gain a bunch of 60 mile high
Mars right now let's take fentanyl
what what price did we put on it for
China
what's the price
they're killing her or killing our
people
uh how about the cartels what's the
price
nothing no price
no if you want to stop Fentanyl you say
to China and the cartels here's your
price
here's your deadline
here's your price this is what we're
going to take from you and keep forever
I don't know what that would be but
we're going to take it we're going to
keep it forever
whatever it is
how about we say we're going to give
Taiwan High Mars with 600 mile range
unless you get rid of fentanyl is that a
price
that's a prize but we're not giving
Taiwan the good stuff
I would say to China we're going to arm
Taiwan until it can destroy your whole
 mainland
all all we're asking all we're asking is
stop the Fentanyl
now I'm not saying that's the answer but
there is something that China wants that
we can take from them
isn't there is there nothing we can take
from China I'm sure there is sure there
is we we could kick out a hundred
percent of their students
right there's something we can take from
them and we have not put a price on it
so how serious are we if we didn't price
it
price it
right price the thing how about
the cartels
what's the price to them of doing
fentanyl it's just profit
because there's no greater risk because
of fentanyl than the other stuff they
were doing there's no price at all
the price to the cartel says we should
give them the date they'll disappear
we could do that
we just say March 1st 2023 if we see one
ounce of fentanyl come across the border
all of your operations will disappear
in 24 hours they'll all be gone
and on that date they'll all be gone
and then do it
and then you say all right if you
rebuild them we're looking at April 1st
and then you go and you take all the
ship just take everything
but
if we don't put a price on it you're
going to get the result you have so let
me ask you this
who in our government is even serious
about Fentanyl nobody
nobody
and all of you saying oh Carrie Lake
she's tough because she wants to work on
border security that'll take care of
five percent of it
now that's the magic trick the magic
trick on fentanyl is you're looking at
the border and that's just misdirection
border security very good I'm a fan I
want the tightest border we could get
this isn't the fentanyl solution it's
just a part of it
what about uh legalizing alternatives to
fentanyl in my opinion legalizing
fentanyl itself for recreational use
would be stupid
because it's too dangerous
what the addict wants is the high they
don't want the Fentanyl
they want the high that the fentanyl
gives them so if you said all right you
can't have this fencil because it's
going to kill too many people but we
would normally never do this but we're
going to make
uh let's say Oxycontin or heroin
legal
and you know maybe there's some
restrictions but
um I asked this question I said how many
would you agree with testing
keyword here is testing in one place
the legalization of alternatives to
Fentanyl
61 of my respondents disagreed with
testing
um what the is wrong with you
who disagrees with testing
seriously is there somebody here who
wants to argue that point
there's somebody here really wants to
argue that that testing is bad
right here's why you're arguing it
because Michael schellenberger convinced
you that it didn't work in San Francisco
right and some other places with the
open needle exchange situation
you realize I'm not talking about that
right
right there there are probably a hundred
different ways you could test some
variant of that you know one would be do
whatever you want here's some free drugs
one would be some kind of control one
would be you can have the free drugs but
you have to submit to some kind of
conditions are there not a million ways
to do it and why the did San
Francisco do it in the middle of the in
the middle of the city the worst place
you could do such a thing right I guess
that's where the people were but are you
telling me there's no other way to do a
limited test of course there is you why
you should why should you should take
away from shellenberger's reporting on
the open-air drug things that didn't
work what you should take away from that
is what doesn't work
right it doesn't work so don't do that
so if you think that I'm saying
reproduce the things we already tested
that didn't work no that's why you test
things
yeah moving move into Pleasanton
if you put it in one place it's fine
with me actually actually I I I'm going
to embrace and amplify you somebody said
oh Scott tested in Pleasanton you know
tested in my town with all the drug
addicts okay here's how I would test it
I would have uh one entity so it's
controlled hand out pills
that are fentanyl replacements for free
just see what happens
because there are definitely addicts in
Pleasant and plenty of them
and those addicts would have one place
they could go to and get a free
controlled pill
that is much much less likely to kill
them than something that might or might
not have fentanyl in it they don't know
all right are you telling me that that
would be worse
let me let me take this to one person
all right I I know addicts do you all
know addicts
I I guess part of part of your opinion
about why it would differ is how well
you know actual addicts
right I know actual addicts like the
real kind the the no joke kind like real
real addicts
if you talk to a real addict they will
tell you they'll they would stop
Fentanyl and harping
if something's legal and available and
safer and an alternative there's nothing
about fentanyl they want it's just the
high
and and so if you said to them okay you
can go buy your own illegal Fentanyl
and maybe die or you could have it for
free
in this nice little storefront
but you might you know maybe some of
your privacy would be lost or something
I saw there's a trade-off always
all right so here's my point
if you ever disagree to testing
something small you're always on the
wrong side
you're just on the wrong side
if you say it's been tested so you don't
need to test it again just be careful
you're looking at the same test
because those open-air attic things
that's not what I'm talking about
I'm talking about literally saying all
right this one pill that's a pretty good
substitute for fentanyl we'll just make
this one pill available
you just have to come get it and then go
back to where you are
you know don't don't hang around the
neighborhood but you can get the pill
here and go wherever you were
so I would test that
and so the people who say why are you
getting tough with uh
tough with China and Mexico because it's
really about personal choice it's not
one or the other
if somebody's trying to kill you
intentionally you kill them back right
it's not that you have better ways to do
stuff you know you also kill them back
all right
um Rasmussen asked uh did a poll and
asked
what people if people thought that media
coverage of the election was balanced
uh I'm going to give you a little quiz
here what percentage of the general
public do you think said that the media
coverage was balanced
oh my God
swear there are so many Geniuses on this
live stream how do you do that yeah it's
26 percent which is roughly uh
some people would call that almost a
quarter yeah
huh wow
you guys are good guessers
you're you're handsome and sexy and good
guessers nice job
all right uh question so everybody's
gonna be talking about whether the Trump
candidates won or lost you know was
Trump A Plus or a minus and I heard
somebody say that uh Carey Lake and uh
Vance were Trump candidates and they won
so that shows that
being a trump selection is a good thing
to which I said I don't think that had
anything to do with why Lake and Vance
wand
do you think Trump was a factor in Kerry
Lake and
and Vance
did Lake win
it's not over yet is it JD Vance yeah
and Janie Vance spoke about a fentanyl
so he's already my favorite uh favorite
uh politician but
I think that when you hear JD Vance talk
and you hear Kerry Lake talk isn't it
obvious that they're just operating at a
higher level than other candidates
like it just like screams
it just screams from the screen these
are not your regular candidates
they would be popular whether they're
Democrats or anything else they're just
really good at what they do they're good
in public they speak well they're smart
they they seem to have the right level
of empathy and hard-nosedness now
they're just really good candidates
anything you say about the Trump
connection is interesting but you know
you're burying the lead that they're
just they're exceptional just humans
all right let me get a
uh oh so Kerry Lake as I have now
yeah it looks like she's pulling ahead
so it sounded like she was confident
that the because it was the same day
votes that are not counted you know the
day of election and those usually favor
the Republicans so she should win
all right uh yeah Herschel is a
different story
um all right let me let me take your
temperature
you have two choices for a Republican
president to DeSantis and Trump can be
your choice as of today does Santa Trump
go
assume they're both running
assume they're both in the primary
DeSantis or Trump
uh I'm seeing uh about two to one
DeSantis on the locals platform
and I'm seeing uh
about about two to one yeah it's about
21. it's not even close is it
so
uh do you think Trump can win in a
general election against any Democrat
yeah
I
I wonder if he can win
yep
I mean certainly can you know you don't
want to you don't rule them out I would
say that DeSantis couldn't lose
but Trump might win and he might lose
I think I think DeSantis it would be
almost impossible for him to lose with
the current situation which could change
a lot between now and election day
why would this why would desensis lose
what's the reasoning see I I feel as if
the country is looking for a
uh a person who doesn't say provocative
things all the time
yeah greater entertainment value with
Trump that's for sure
foreign policy
I know I think the Republicans would
have similar foreign policy no matter
who it was
oh we'll see all right
um
has anybody made the point that bodily
autonomy is one of those things you
shouldn't mess with
you know it's funny how many times
bodily autonomy was on the on the uh the
midterm election so you had weed which
is bodily autonomy
yeah people are still concerned about
vaccinations bodily autonomy abortion
bodily autonomy
there's a lot of bodily autonomy stuff
that's that's bubbling up
I don't I don't know if there's a point
to that it's just a coincidence
all right Russia has announced that it's
leaving uh curse on which is a key City
in that disputed area they had once
claimed that that was now permanently
Russia but apparently permanently only
lasted a few months because they're
already withdrawn now the ukrainians are
wary that it's a trick
they think it might be a trick to lure
them into
Urban fighting which sounds like the
worst trick ever
has anybody ever lured uh anybody ever
lured another military into an urban
area so that they could attack him
better in the urban area
that does that sound like like a good
trick
that doesn't even feel like a good trick
I mean I'm not I'm not a military expert
but
you mean stop well but they have escaped
that they would always have an Escape
Route wouldn't they
yeah
so uh it makes sense that Ukraine
doesn't trust Russia about anything but
to me it looks like actually a retreat
uh here's the interesting side note
and this is a huge coincidence by the
way I don't want you to read into this
any more than the story has so there's a
giant coincidence just the same day
that Russia announced they were pulling
out of Curson
the military leader in Curson
had I think this is an amazing
coincidence an automobile accident that
killed them yeah he died in an ordinary
automobile accident on the last day of
Curzon and here in weirder uh later that
night he was given a uh a metal you know
an honorary medal so he was not only
honored for his service but damn
what bad luck he had to die on the very
day that they were with John huh
Putin just killed him and gave him the
medal so it didn't look too obvious he
killed him and gave him a medal that is
such an awesome way to kill somebody
you schedule their medal ceremony you
kill them right before the medal
ceremony and then people are like
well could have been him he was giving
him a medal
right it just puts enough doubt in your
head you're like well he seemed to like
him if he was giving him a medal and
then he just kills him
all right
um I don't know if this is more evidence
that Ukraine is going to get back a
bunch of territory and wind or not but
one of the things is that the Russian
military in its in its attempt to leave
uh or discovering that most of the
bridges for leaving have been blown up
by the ukrainians
so you've got the the Russians all
bunched into a gigantic traffic jam
trying to get out of town
and they're just sitting there while the
ukrainians are shelling
so somehow Russia found a way to take a
bad situation and make it worse you know
it looks like they're really pounding Us
in you in the Curson what will we do
I've got an idea let's bring all of our
military outdoors and put them into a
really crunched little area and leave
them there for a long time within range
of all of their weapons
so that's happening
all right
um
Twitter continues to fascinate
this morning I looked at a Twitter
exchange between Mark Cuban and Elon
Musk in which Mark Cuban was making some
suggestions about what he didn't like
about the the changes about who can get
verified Etc and the details don't
matter what matters is
that you watched we just publicly
watched Mark Cuban and Elon Musk you
know two of the greatest entrepreneurs
of our time negotiate
like features of a product that we all
know and use
how awesome is that
and then you know Elon Musk said himself
that they're gonna Twitter's gonna make
a bunch of mistakes in the coming months
but they're they're sort of feeling
their way toward something better
uh they've already made some substantial
changes I guess everybody can get
verified now
I'm a little behind on what the changes
are they're happening so quickly which
is part of the story but I believe
everybody can pay eight dollars and get
a little check
right I saw some people have done that
uh
you get verified for eight dollars right
okay
so I think Mark Cuban was saying that
that made the verification thing kind of
useless because now he doesn't know you
know which people are prominent because
it does help to know which people are
the prominent voices to pick them out
quickly
uh it is however a highly undemocratic
and it makes some people Elite on
Twitter so you can see why people would
not want that
but it did have some advantages as Mark
Cuban was pointing out uh anyway so I I
tweeted out to people who are not
familiar with business practices that if
you don't know that you're watching you
know one of the greatest entrepreneurs a
B test features in public
if you don't know what you're watching
you think it looks you know disjointed
and maybe he doesn't know what he's
doing but if you do know what you're
watching
it's exactly right
he is moving fast he's breaking things
he's moving fast getting getting
feedback
and with software with software moving
fast and breaking things is exactly what
you want to do if it were Hardware
you know it's a little harder to change
Hardware so you don't maybe that's a
that's more of a measure twice cut once
let me say this clearly
with Hardware or big you know
Investments you want to measure twice
and cut once you want to get it right
with software because it's so easy to
change it
you you want to uh you know cut twice
and measure once it sounds all backwards
but you you do you can catch your
mistakes and fix them so quickly that
getting it wrong fast actually moves you
ahead
so all right uh
how many people on Twitter have noticed
that the trolling is down
are you noticing less trolling
I I did notice it and I didn't know if
it was just because I haven't been
provocative lately
it to me it looks significant
now I would think that the the original
blue checks you know the old old style
blue checks like me I would think we
would notice it first because we get
more troll action than the rest of you
right I would say mitral uh ratio is way
down way down I don't know why I don't I
don't know what change was made
uh but I like it
all right
um
I'm going to give you an update on my
personal medical situation not because
that should be important to you but
because of what it might teach you all
right so I'm going to make this useful
to you even though it sounds all
self-referential
uh so I told you you know most of you
know the story I was on blood pressure
meds and their side effect almost killed
me because it made me suicidal
for months I didn't know it was the drug
until I got off it and it made me so uh
so sore
that I could barely walk across the room
I was just like a shot in a zombie
um so my doctor came back from uh from a
vacation so I got to catch up and she
did something that I think you should
all do
she did a
medication review
so she looked at all of my medications
because you know at a certain age they
start to creep up I've got you know one
thing for acid reflux and other things
for blood pressure another thing for
asthma
and uh
she agreed with me to take me off of all
blood pressure meds because my lifestyle
changes were sufficient
and then she said uh you know how often
are you taking your asthma beds and I
said well every day and they're working
well because I don't have any asthma
symptoms
and you know I don't know maybe 20 years
ago or something my doctor put me on
these everyday asthma stuff and I
thought talk about a medical success
so here I was with a pretty bad asthma
problem if it were triggered by certain
things and
and here I am taking this asthma meds
every day and completely eliminated the
problem
and then she said you don't need to be
on that
and I said what
she said no if you're not having any
symptoms that means you don't need any
asthma medications
and I said but I thought I was not
having symptoms because of the
medication
and she said
nope
[Laughter]
guess what one of the side effects of
the the asthma medicine is muscle
soreness
muscle soreness right
so I stopped my asthma meds yesterday
now I had experimented with it and it
didn't change anything so I I've been
off as many medicine before just to test
and I didn't feel any different you know
no no triggering of anything but I
thought it was yeah I just got lucky but
um so now I'm completely off of asthma
meds I'm completely off of blood
pressure meds my blood pressure is fine
my energy is perfect
my body feels like a 25 year old
the meds were killing me
now if you haven't done a uh a medicine
review especially if you're a certain
age if you haven't done a medicine
review with your doctor because remember
this doctor was not the original one who
put me on asthma meds that was like a
doctor or two ago I was just continuing
because they told me to
yeah I was just doing what the doctors
told me but you need to check in because
I'm guessing just a guess that when I
was prescribed to do it every day that
probably was the recommendation and then
the recommendation changed but nobody
checked with me
until now so kudos to my doctor I like
my doctor a lot which is why I waited
for her to return
so she's got me on a good good track now
and
uh I did not know how many ordinary
medicines cause muscle soreness
do you know what happens to your life
when you have muscle soreness
you are less active
do you know what happens when you're
less active
your whole life is ruined
it ruins your whole life you exercise
less and then the spiral happens right
downers fire
I I feel like I could run a marathon
right now and I can't even run you know
two miles
but my body is like 100 and all I did
was get rid of two meds that I did not
know were causing any problems I didn't
know for a long time
so that's my advice
um no cat and help no no cat in the
house helps the asthma it might yeah I
don't have a cat in the house at the
moment
it might so we'll see we'll see
that's the good news all right ladies
and gentlemen
the thing I promise you
is that you'll hear things on this live
stream that you don't hear on other
platforms and it'll be useful stuff did
I succeed today
did you see anything today that you're
not expecting to see anywhere else
the answer is yes somebody said no
yes you did
you you haven't heard the tick tock
thing anywhere else you'll probably hear
it by the end of today but you haven't
heard anything else
uh Mr bankman started a bank yeah that's
true
all right
uh all right uh YouTube
um
yeah I noticed that a lot of you enjoy
interacting with each other in the
comments so it's partly about the live
stream but it's partly about you know
it's like a little Club you get to talk
to people who have something in common
the weight of glasses on the bridge of
nose and sinuses I've never heard that
theory I did have my sinuses you know
roto-rooted out a year and a half ago so
that probably helps
all right enough for now I'll talk to
you YouTube
tomorrow
