foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that ever happened in
this universe and dare I say the
afterlife
I don't usually talk about the afterlife
but today
have you noticed that there's something
missing in the news about Ukraine
I'll tell you about that and then we'll
do the simultaneous sip
the holiest that there's ever been
yes I've noticed that a lot of people
have been talking about Ukraine and and
Russia and the possibility of War but we
have not heard from the Pope
now the pope was not available
but I know how he thinks and so I
thought I would
give you the official
Pope opinion on the possibility of war
in Ukraine
give me a moment let me concentrate
want to receive the signal clearly
religious signal coming in
uh got it
the pope would have you know that he is
opposed to war
I think you're glad you waited for that
so when it comes to the Pope
no war doesn't like it one bit not one
bit
and that ladies and gentlemen
is the religious opinion
on the war and I don't think that has
been given enough attention so I thought
I'd help
do I look better with a hat is it my
imagination or
this is my imagination or did I get
uglier when I took the hat off is it
just me
I think that actually happened
I think that's
I think we I think we found something we
could all agree on I look better with a
hat because it you know I think I'd look
better with a hat and a mask
there's a lot of the pandemic my my
ugliness was completely covered so I'd
have sunglasses on
and then have a mask and then I'd wear a
baseball hat
so basically basically the only parts of
my my entire body that we're showing on
the colder days were my hands unless I
had gloves on or my hands and this
little little strip of skin right here
which by the way looks pretty good on me
best part of my body and this was just
pure luck
Pure Luck
the best part of my entire body is this
narrow strip just above where my mask
line would be and below my sunglasses
I don't like to brag
but honestly I've got one of the best
over mask under sunglasses area of a
body
I've ever seen
I do work on it
moisturizer stay out of the Sun a lot of
people don't put the work in but I do
how would you like the simultaneous sip
then all you need is a copper mugger or
less attacker tells it's not the canteen
jungle plastic vessel any kind
fill it with your favorite beverage
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure that dopamine the
other day the thing that makes
absolutely everything better it's called
what what what is it called that's right
the simultaneous Sip and happens now go
oh
I don't know
something happened hold on a second
I hate it when this happens
I accidentally turned my coffee into
wine
that
you think you've got things under
control
okay I stole that joke from somebody on
the locals platform
I saw your comments at locals and I did
steal your joke but they didn't see it
they didn't see it on YouTube
so for a moment there they thought I had
a pretty good pretty good joke
until I had to admit it wasn't mine
well uh let's do a little update on
freedom uh I was out and about
yesterday
and day before looking at how many
people have taken off their masks now
that the California mandate has been
dropped so if you're in a store or
shopping or whatever you do not require
a mask
um where I live about 80 percent of
people are still masked
that's right
my state was offered as freedom
and 80 percent of the residents said
well thank you but no thank you I would
rather stay in my little Mass cage
including Outdoors
now I'm not positive this is true but I
think the outdoor masking is at an
all-time high
this is after the mask mandate is
completely eliminated outdoor masking
I've never seen higher outdoor masking
than right now
now
I had actually talked to some people who
shall remain anonymous
who actually said they kind of liked the
mask era for a variety of reasons they
liked them
there are people who like The Masks
apparently you can get used to anything
I wasn't one of them but
so I didn't see that coming and I was uh
did a little tweet today to ask what
mandates are still in effect in the
United States so here here are the ones
I know about
and we'll see if these get mopped up I
hope they do so the remaining mandates
are let's see New York City you still
need vaccination passports to go in a
restaurant
that's still true right give me a fact
check as I go and add some ones if you
know I believe health care workers
including everybody the janitor is a
receptionist everybody in healthcare are
still under mandatory vaccinations
that's true right
I still need masks on public transport
and for flying and in particular
well I guess just in public transport I
still need masks in some places like
students are doing it in a lot of
schools Washington State Massachusetts
California Hawaii still got some masks
Federal buildings masks and cruise ships
which I guess is a form of public
transport
so those are the do what ones did I miss
has the has the passport
where else is the vaccine passport
um
in effect
flying
so here so here's a sort of a checkpoint
does it look like if you were just to
judge the pandemic
in terms of freedoms given up
compared to other countries just
Freedom's given up are we doing okay I
mean is the United States
are we doing well enough
to claw back our freedoms because we
have some
you know in Canada I know some of the
provinces gave up on some of their
mandates
but we're not really we're not close to
the end point
and we're not close
but I do think we're going to get away
without vaccine passports
what do you think
do you think at this point what is your
current prediction about USA and vaccine
passports
I I feel like we're going to not have
them
am I wrong
because if we don't have him yet it
feels like this wouldn't be the time to
implement them I don't think public
would would accept it now
yeah so I would say
um I'm gonna give I'm going to give
America a c plus
in regaining freedoms
would you agree
I'll give us a c plus like lots of work
to do but
it's not as bad as it could have been I
mean it could have been worse I suppose
but we're not close we got to keep
clawing
um have you noticed that the entire
retail part of at least America I don't
know if this is happening anywhere else
has turned to garbage
I I as I tweeted yesterday I went into
six retail establishments and walked out
of each one
because buying something was too hard
here's what happened and I don't know if
anybody has noticed this trend yet
if you make it possible to buy almost
everything online
who is remaining to stand in line at an
actual retail store now in the short run
it's everybody right in the short run
you buy some stuff online but sometimes
you go to stores over time more and more
people will move to online only and then
the pandemic hits and more and more
online there
so who's left
well let me tell you who's left
it's all the people who have a freaking
problem
right right you know how bad it is to
get behind the uh the elderly person
who's writing a check
at the grocery store like you don't want
to be in that line now imagine that
because all of the efficient people have
already moved completely online
the people in line are only the people
writing a check in the grocery store and
people like that now
add to the fact that the only people in
line are the people with problems
on top of that
on top of that the stores are asking for
more stuff
now they want your phone number they've
got to find out if you've got a coupon
is a coupon good are you part of the
Loyalty program if you don't have your
card can you plug it in do you want to
donate something
yeah there's you've got four ways to pay
and sometimes IDs sometimes not
so I stood in line and I and nobody
could get helped because everybody who
was in line had like a story
not only did the person in line have a
story
but then the retail worker had their own
story like data they had to collect and
explaining why they're doing things and
I thought to myself I don't think I'll
ever go into a retail establishment
again
because what whatever good or bad they
used to be
they've just turned to garbage you can
never buy your size am I right go into a
store and find your size in anything
basically you can't
um how many of you have stood in line
long enough that you took out your phone
you scanned the barcode on the thing in
your hand and you ordered it from Amazon
and then you got it in a line and put it
back on the Shelf
how many have done that
I'm not the only one I saw somebody
commented on Twitter yeah a lot of you
because the the the process of in-store
has gotten worse and worse as they make
you do more work just to pay buy
something
I don't know I think retail is in big
trouble even more than you know we
obviously have known for a long time
here's a little tip for you if you're
trying to figure out what trade to get
into
uh Lisa de Pasquale
was commenting on my comment about
retail and she said uh it's awful in
this economy why am I spending so much
time begging to pay people
have you had this experience
you you call somebody for some kind of a
service just something that needs to be
repaired or serviced or something you
can't get anybody to show up
people say well maybe in two weeks
yeah right so if you were going to pick
a field to enter
find out who you can't hire now
if you can't get um I'll give you one
example
all right
um I'm going to give you a trade tip
that's a pretty good one you ready for
this
fireplace repair person
because a lot of fireplaces are gas
operated
fireplace repair person it looks like
the easiest job in the world because
they're only like three elements to the
the whole thing
and and you know not too many
manufacturers
so
try to try to book one you think you can
get one same day nope nope you can't so
if you wanted to enter a trade find out
who can't show up
and take your money because there are
people begging to give people money and
they can't find anybody to take it we
have a whole country of people who have
more money
than they have services that they can
buy they want to buy stuff they can't
find anybody to do it
so that's the thing we'll talk about in
Ukraine of course
uh turns out that cow manure is is now
economical as a major energy source
so Dairy Farmers are being approached by
energy companies that turn manure into
methane I guess and then into energy and
they figured out the economics to the
point where I'm not entirely sure about
this but I think the cow might be
more uh worth more than the milk
I don't know that that's true
but are we going to get to a point where
Cow Shed is more valuable than the milk
that comes out of the same cap
and if we're turning gaussian into
electricity
doesn't that mean that we're turning
basically everything green into
electricity we're basically we're going
to have to mow down forests and the cows
are going to be traveling all over the
grassy that and turning that into
electricity is that really efficient
I feel like I feel like there might be a
better way to get your electricity
uh but anyway that's a that's a thing
that's happening we reached the
crossover point for profitability
and of course that you ask yourself why
do you need cows
we got seven people seven billion people
pooping all over the place how many cows
are there are there more than seven
billion cows
why don't you capture some people poop
all right um
here's a here's a reason why nobody can
be a good or bad predictor
and this is the weirdest thing but maybe
this was always the case but it seems
especially the case now
that will never agree what is going to
happen I think you'd agree with that
easily we never agree what's going to
happen like when we predict people who
predict all over the place
but the weirdest part that might be new
but I guess you'd have to ask a
historian
we can no longer agree on what did
happen
that feels like it's new so if you're in
the business of predicting things as I
sort of am
you can't even know if you were right
because I can think I was right and
other people will say well look at the
facts you were clearly wrong so you
can't even know if you can predict right
because there will be no agreement on
what is here's a perfect example
I predicted that Russia would not invade
Ukraine
did they
[Laughter]
I don't know
because it turns out that they did move
troops into an area where they already
had troops
and already controlled the two
separatist regions that were already
under complete Russian control
apparently
so
if they move troops into a place they
already had troops
into a region that was really not under
control of Ukraine anyway it was already
Russian
did they invade
so it was my prediction already wrong
so I asked the poll because I had no
idea how people would see this
50 of the people who answered my Twitter
poll which is of course not scientific
um half of them said is not quite an
invasion
not quite an invasion
but 37 percent said yes so 37 percent of
the people in my Twitter poll and these
Raven people would be largely friendly
to my point of view
just think I'm wrong and that the my
prediction has already been you know
proven wrong
but 50 of the people said I'm right so
how do I even know if I'm a good
predictor
I I don't think you could just take the
majority in this case I mean you can see
that it's so clear that people don't
even agree on literal reality at this
point because you can just word think it
away oh it's part of Ukraine oh it's not
and you both have a good argument
but uh yesterday zielinski himself said
quote with today's and possibly
tomorrow's decisions Russia is
legalizing its troops which have
actually been in the occupied
territories of donbest since 2014.
it seems to me that the president of
Ukraine does not believe that Ukraine
has been invaded I mean at least not
this week already invaded I guess
so if the president you've created
thinks I'm right so far
so far it's not looking like I'm going
to be right
it does look like Putin's you know
poised to do more
but at the moment
am I right or am I wrong in the in the
comments you tell me
at the moment has Ukraine been invaded
already this week
I'll just read out some of the answers
yes no wrong
um
yeah it's early in the week right nope
nope nope
okay so we are mixed on that all right
let's talk about what's happening
um I had some curiosity about whether
Russian citizens know what's going on in
Ukraine
now of course there's state-run media is
all propaganda
so the state-run media is all misleading
if you live in Russia would you agree
with that
the state-run media is completely
misleading to the Russian public but
don't they have internet access
I actually I wasn't sure
until I actually did some Googling to
find out what's going on and the and
Russia of course is doing a variety of
things to try to suppress
access to information that would be bad
for them but they do things like
throttling certain content
there is they're not the internet is
still available right if you live in
Russia
can't you call up CNN web page in
America
there's nothing blocking that right
can you give me a fact check on that
oh okay so I'm seeing on locals the very
next thing I was going to talk about
is the fact that Russians by and large
don't speak English
the only reason that they don't know
what's going on
because everything that's in Russian
presumably would be problem
and do we have a problem that if the
public in Russia had a better
understanding what was happening
that they would not support their own
president I don't know maybe they would
anyway so here's a question have you
seen anywhere in the news if the Russian
public
supports Putin so far and everything
he's done how many of you could answer
the question does the Russian public by
a majority support what Putin is doing
right now
because I've got a feeling they might
right
it seems like probably
because you know Putin can control
information to some extent
but also maybe because they like it
you can't rule out the you can't rule
out the fact that they might just like a
strong leader
he's made a reasonable argument that
these you know russian-speaking people
should be part of the historic Republic
and maybe the public likes it
Maybe
if it doesn't cost too much
um
so Putin also revealed
that he asked President Clinton years
ago if he could join NATO
is it now that's not the first time
we've heard that right it's the first
time for me I didn't know it but
apparently there was some was there any
knowledge about that before
I think there might have been
but it wasn't widely known right
um
and so
four years now I've been saying that
Russia and the United States are natural
allies
and that the only reason we would be at
each other's
throats
is psychological
like there's not a material reason that
we would be enemies there's just a
psychological maybe historical reasons
or whatever
so
or political
and I wonder what would have happened if
um if Russia had been considered for
NATO
because I thought the whole point of
NATO was to deter Russia or the Soviet
Union originally
am I wrong that the point of NATO was
mostly about Russia
and what happens if Russia has to join
the the alliance against Russia
now I get that they would do more than
that they would they would protect more
than Russia but
I don't know is NATO active
in anything that would involve China
so I'm a little bit confused about what
is the point of NATO
if the enemy of NATO asked if he could
join NATO
and it also makes me wonder if that was
just an incredible Master Persuader move
that didn't work out
but it but it should have confused the
United States right
if the person that you're trying to
protect against asks you to join the
organization of people protecting
against them what the hell do you think
I mean how do you process that
the way you should process it is that
NATO doesn't make sense
and if that's what Putin was doing
it was brilliant
I mean it didn't obviously it didn't end
NATO but it would have been a brilliant
play to confuse people about why NATO
even exists and put some doubt in
everybody's mind about how much to fund
it it could have been an incredibly
genius move that was always meant to
never be successful but just put that
down and in a way is very similar to
what Trump did with Kim
in North Korea
because
what Trump did was simply act like he
was his his personal friend
which just ruins the whole frame you're
like every Everything historically that
made sense instantly didn't make sense
does Trump just changed the frame of
reference to we're two buddies and by
the way can I help you with your economy
why why would you give me trouble we're
Buddies
why would you why would you point a
nuclear weapon to me why would my buddy
do that
I mean I think the way Trump handled
North Korea is one of the all-time great
things that anybody ever did politically
honestly I think it would go down and
just one of the great moves of all times
it might not last if somebody else
causes trouble with North Korea but it
was great at the time and I think that
Putin played a similar
frame breaking play
maybe not as successfully
he just broke the frame that it's an
enemy
and an Army against the enemy hey can I
join the Army it's kind of it's kind of
brilliant
but I do think it supports my idea that
we're natural allies because if he could
even keep a stray face while saying can
you put us in NATO
and he probably did if you could say
that with a straight face it probably
means that you you have an argument that
we don't really need to be enemies
there's just nothing to be gained from
it
all right
um
one of the worst things about war and
the threat of War
is that the leaders on both sides can
become more popular
with war
isn't that the worst thing ever
you want your leaders to know that if
they want everyone to war for anything
they would become less popular
but they don't you know we have an
automatic nationalist Instinct in this
country and every other country that as
soon as something looks like War the
leader's approval goes up it's almost
automatic
and so Biden being in the the basement
of presidential approval
uh according to Rasmussen it looks like
he's getting a pop
Biden's approval is going up do you
think he's earned it
so far just because obviously this is
based on Ukraine do you think he's
earned it just on Ukraine so forget
about everything else just for a moment
because these polls tend to move with
current events
I'm saying almost all knows
okay well I see one yes
I'm saying hell knows okay you're you
seem to be quite unified on no
are you surprised that his approval is
taking up
with this many no's you should think
well how could his approval be going up
all right let me give you an argument
for Biden
this is going to piss you off
right now keep in mind we don't know
what happens tomorrow
so I'm only going to talk about what's
happened so far
here's what's happened so far
Russia has lost the Nordstrom too
because by moving troops into the two
occupied territories the separatist
territories that triggered Germany to
say okay nordstream 2 is done
so that's a big economic Kip a number of
other sanctions will probably kick in
but not not the worst of them right so
the minor sanctions might kick in hurt a
little bit around the edges
so so far
Russia has spent a bunch of money
it has degraded its International
reputation a lost Nordstrom
and if it attacks it's going to get
you know extra pain
and what is and what is Russia gained so
far what did it gain so far all it
gained
was the property it already owned which
was the separatist regions
so so far
so far
Russia broke broke even on land
and is taking a hit pretty big hit to
its GDP
uh Biden has so far gone cheap
so Biden so far hasn't committed you
know large funds to military
and he got a huge degradation of
an opposing country
so far
Biden is winning
now I don't think that's I I'm not
predicting that will last okay so I'm
not I'm not saying that when we're all
said and done I'm going to say hey Biden
you handle that just right that seems
unlikely
but
didn't that piss you off a little bit
it did didn't it
because you're almost every one of you
said he's
he's doing everything wrong
but so far he's a head-on score
am I wrong about that
am I wrong that so far he's ahead in
points doesn't mean he wins the game at
all but so far
give me the argument in a in a short
comment can you
I get that some of you are disagreeing I
see the disagreement but get can you
give me the reason
he created it by being weak
um
World stage loser it's only the fourth
inning that's true
no because it's BS
you take his flawed he's weak and the
world will pay so is it his weakness
his weakness right but does he look weak
because he did unify NATO
so if he unified NATO
killed Nordstrom 2 hurt Russia's economy
hurt their standing in the world
he didn't come out ahead so far
now our stock market will go down as
well I think Russia went down 40 billion
dollars yesterday or this week
he failed to deter him but that also
only matters if he keeps going because
he's only been undeterred to take what
he already owned
somebody says he didn't unify NATO all
right so here's here's another perfect
example of what I was just saying
I was just saying that not only do
people predict what will happen
differently but once something has
happened we don't even agree what
happened
isn't this another perfect example and
by the way I'm not going to disagree
with you on this
I I made my best argument for you know
an argument that was a Biden
has done a reasonably good job so far
that was my best argument for it I don't
disagree with your argument that
that he's blowing it
I feel like it's a little premature
because as somebody said it's this is
the fourth inning you got to kind of
wait to the end to see who won right so
I'm going to wait to the end to see you
one but unlike some of you
uh I'm I'm way closer to wait and see
then something terrible has happened
already
what happens
so here's here's what I think is one
strong possibility
do you think that Putin could claim
victory
if all he did was consolidate control
over the two separatist regions
would that be enough
for him to say yay I won got everything
I want I liberated these two separatist
regions I'm a liberator
can he go home
can he go home with a win
maybe you know he maybe even makes money
if the price of fuel goes up the
whatever he can deliver without
Nordstrom too doesn't he sell it for a
higher price if Energy prices went up
maybe they won't they won't stay up if
he leaves
but have we not created a situation
in which by Biden and zielinski
you could say cleverly but other people
would say weekly as in being weak
is it weak or is it clever that Biden
and zelinski have allowed
that whatever Putin does with the two
separatist regions doesn't seem to count
as an invasion
is it weak or clever because one
possibility is that it allows Putin an
easy escape hatch
he can claim victory in a fairly
credible way he could claim victory and
and then he'd have a way to back down
and still look like the strong leader
and still have a gain Within
and I suppose he could still keep
pushing on the rest of Ukraine
and then would Biden look like he's a
winner
because he didn't really give them
anything they didn't already have and
they lost the Nordstrom too
I know I I think there's a situation now
where both can be winners
and maybe zielinski too
you know zelinski is still saying that
he doesn't think there'll be an invasion
of a Ukraine proper
I guess I shouldn't say proper he
doesn't think there'll be an invasion of
whatever's left of Ukraine
and do you think he's lying about that
do you think zelenski is just lying and
he's trying to keep the public from
panicking
or does he really not think that that
Putin will cross the line because maybe
the price is too high
let me ask you this remember I said that
um Putin doesn't know what kind of
weapons would be thrown against him
because this should be the first time
the most modern at least American
Weaponry gets used in that kind of
battle
against a sophisticated foe
what happens if Putin goes into battle
and gets a bloody nose
he could now here's something I don't
think any of you thought of
all right we know that the United States
has incredible cyber warfare
capabilities we assume so right maybe
not but you you make the assumption that
the United States says there are other
countries you'd make that assumption
about
Israel
you would assume they have great cyber
warfare capabilities
you think China does
you think Russia does Great Britain
France probably right so you can name a
number of countries that you're pretty
sure
have the best cyber warfare capabilities
now
does the United States sell weapons
to Ukraine
actually I don't know the answer to that
do we we sell them weapons directly or
does it go through some kind of middle
channel for any reason we do it directly
right
yeah I think we do we sell it or do we
provide them
we sell them right so the Stinger
missiles and the anti-anti-tank missiles
we sell them so would you agree with the
following statement we can sell them
weapons yes right
there's nothing to stop us from selling
weapons
could you
this is going to blow the top of your
head off
wait for this
could you
sell cyber warfare as a service
as a service
and here's what I mean by that you say
the Ukraine and it doesn't have to be
the United States it could be an ally
it could be Israel could Israel I'll
just well let me not throw Israel into
the bus they have enough problems let me
pick let me pick a country albonia could
albonia a made-up country with a great
cyber warfare capability
say to Ukraine we will sell you the
services but you can't have the IP or
the tools we'll keep the tools so you
can't do this on your own but as a
service if you if you push this button
it will turn off the lights in Moscow
and then the ukrainians would have to be
the ones that push the button
but whatever happens after they push the
button goes through the cyber warfare
cyber warfare as a service by the by the
way those of you who work in technology
when I use when I use the phrase
uh software as a service you're familiar
with that
this would be cyber warfare as a service
because you definitely don't want to
give your cyber warfare tools
to any country that doesn't already have
them right
not even an ally probably I assume so
you can't give your tools away
but you could sell if you could sell a
weapon
you could sell cyber warfare as a
service
you wouldn't be the one pushing the
button
you would just be the one who has a
network that that
you know chain of connections went
through
is that illegal
what was what would stop it from
happening
now let me ask you this if Ukraine could
buy that service for it'd be expensive
but if they could buy that service
what damage could they do to Russia if
Russia attacked
Ukraine's you know more uh more agreed
on territory
here's the answer
Putin doesn't know
am I right
Putin doesn't know
and isn't that a pretty big risk
are you telling me that nobody thought
of this
right so in order for this not to be a
real thing already
would require that the best
cyber warfare strategic thinker in the
country is me
okay we agree that's not the case
right if I thought of it that that's all
I'm saying if I thought of it
it's already done
am I right
and we can't know for sure but if it's
if it's obvious enough that the
cartoonist thought of it
it's got to be
an option at least at least it's an
option now we don't know if Ukraine has
access to that kind of power indirectly
through a service provider
but why wouldn't they
why wouldn't they now it could be that
that would you know whoever provided the
service would then become a Target
but are you telling me that
the people who have cyber warfare
capability
couldn't hide the tools
so that by the time the attack happens
it's just not clear where it came from I
feel like they could so
I don't know that's something Putin has
to worry about so that would suggest
that maybe Putin isn't going to cross a
line that would open up Ukraine's whole
toolbox of weaponry
Wheelman is saying naive
did you see the title to my live stream
today
did everybody read the title to the live
stream
I said this would be my misinformed
opinion on Ukraine
and probably the best ones you hear
today
I'm going to stand by both of those
statements so you don't need to tell me
I'm naive or misinformed
that's the show
that's the show description
misinformed of naive and talking about
world events
if that bothers you
good luck finding somebody who's doing a
better job
[Laughter]
the the problem is that the quality of
commentary on this topic is so low
that if you think my commentary which is
misinformed
and is naive if you think it's going to
be less than the average you're going to
see today
well I'd say pay attention to the
average
because I think we're going to be in the
same ballpark if you know what I mean
so it's not because I'm awesome it's
because I'm not really competing with an
awesome field is What's Happening Here
here's a question I have not seen in the
news do these separatist regions that
Russia just moved new troops into do
they want to be part of Russia
and isn't that the most important
question today
now I know they had a vote right
they had a vote about being part of
Russia but does a vote mean anything in
that part of the world
I wouldn't put a credibility in a vote
I'm saying mostly yeses but I don't know
if you really know that
now now I do believe if I Googled it I
would have the same opinion
but I don't know if that really means
anything
let's get a map
get a map
yeah I get it I I know the the location
is everything in this case
all right well
um do you want to
do you want to see the United States get
involved in any kind of a war in which
we don't know if we're fighting for
something that anybody wants
like would we be fighting for the wrong
side
if the public actually wanted to be
Russian by some majority
oh
um but the longer the the you should
just be aware that American News is not
telling us if those separatist Place
want to be Russian
that should be the main thing that they
talk about
shouldn't it isn't that the main thing
that they should be talking about I
don't think you'll see it any on any
news program today which tells you that
our news is all propaganda
it's funny what I read about you know
the fake news in Russia
I no longer think it's worse than the
United States I do think it's completely
fake in Russia but I don't think ours is
better if our news were real
I know this is a provocative you know
sounds like an overstatement but if our
news were real
the top of the news every day would be
about the opinions of the separatists
region Republic do they want this or not
and all they talk about is the Russian
troop movements and uh and the sanctions
all the news is focusing on the fight
they're not even focusing on
you know the people who matter the most
the public in those areas
well
um we'll see if those sanctions make a
difference I was complaining yesterday
that nobody had estimated the economic
cost to Russia of an attack but
apparently there is a group called the
uh analysts that well they're at Capital
economics
so they are doing some kind of estimates
about what will happen to the GDP
uh under various scenarios of uh of
sanctions
but even when the West had more power to
sanction I guess uh
uh in 2014 we took 2.5 off the off of
Russia's GDP
but now probably Russia is in better
shape to withstand sanctions or at least
sanctions of that level
so they might be looking at it maybe a
one percent or sub five percent
change so would Putin take a chance for
let's say temporarily degrading his GDP
by one to five percent
uh to gain total control over the
separatist regions only
or would that cost
given that he's giving up Nordstrom too
and he had to know that was going to
happen
would he be happy we're just getting two
separatist regions or has he already
paid enough
that he has to go get the rest
because he's sort of paid for it already
I don't know we'll find out
so
um I guess it was a shooting
um some angry white guy with a gun
confronted some
people who were organizing just actually
I think people doing just the traffic
control for antifa and BLM and some
protest and he ended up pulling out a
gun and shooting some of them
now of course I don't condone any of
that I condemn all the violence but the
most predictable thing in the world
was that if he got rid of the police and
you continued to have
protests that were you know bothering
the public
somebody was going to pull a gun
I'm actually surprised there's not more
of it I don't want to see more of it but
I'm surprised there hasn't been more
so you have to give some credit to the
Second Amendment people
because there is a level of uh
constraint
that as horrible as you know these
events are
it's actually more controlled than I
would expect
you know given the craziness of the
general public and the access to guns
um Kyle Rittenhouse is starting some
kind of fund to gather money to sue
media people who have lied about him and
also for other people who get lied about
to have a way to sue the media
might come in handy
do you think I'll have any reasons to
sue the media
how many of the people in the media have
called me a uh right winger
there are a number of people in the in
the major media who have labeled me a
right winger
now
that's the same as calling somebody a
white nationalist in 2022.
so
if I tried to get a job and I didn't
already have you know a public profile
so you know I could do this sort of
thing if I had to get a regular job I
couldn't get one
because somebody would Google me and it
would say he's a a far-right guy
they would translate it in their head to
white nationalist and I could I could
get a job anywhere can I sue
I don't know I mean I wouldn't but it's
an interesting question and it also
makes you wonder uh why didn't this
already exist because the Press had no
accountability
remember I told you that insurance
is the only thing that tells you where
things are really going to go
because eventually everything has to get
insured
everything in the business World anyway
so it doesn't work so much in politics
but within the business world if there's
a business you know element to it the
insurance companies will decide what you
can and can do
because they they will charge you too
much for things that they say are too
dangerous so it's really predictive
and
what's going to happen now that uh there
there would be a organized entity just
to sue the media for lying when their
business model depends on lying
because it does
the the media's business model depends
on lying because it's the lies that get
all the clicks
right I mean they're not going to say it
that way
but it's the truth
um
is that true
somebody's saying that the Ukrainian
president zlonski is an economist and a
cartoonist
I know he's an actor a comedic actor but
he's not a cartoonist is he
and is he an economist
comedian
is he was he an economist
give me a fact check on that
Economist or no who's got a Wikipedia
page
all right I'll check for that
anyway we might be seeing a balance of
power happening now
um one of the interesting things that
people are saying about CNN
legal analysts is that CNN's got some
real problems because of all their uh
sexual misconduct cases that are high
profile that if they don't settle them
and basically pay out you know tens of
millions then they're going to have to
be subject to what is it called
discovery
meaning that in the course of a lawsuit
about something specific a lot of CNN's
Dirty Laundry could come out
and I don't think they could survive it
so CNN might be in a death spiral
because
they're going to have some big lawsuits
from people who worked for CNN
and then you could have lawsuits coming
from the written house and probably
other people that buy into that business
model he's building
and I have a feeling that CNN is going
to give sued out of existence
and there's nothing they can do about it
because if they don't settle
or go bankrupt I guess if they don't
settle
then they're subject to Discovery and
that's actually worse
right so they have a choice of going on
a business by paying off all these
lawsuits or going out of business by
fighting them that might be their only
two choices
so keep an eye on that
um
here is something that uh progressives
and Democrats get wrong every time it's
uh human motivation
especially when math is involved am I
right
the two things the left always get wrong
and by the way if you're new to me I
identify as left of Bernie because I
like I like his goals I just don't like
his math and I don't like how he thinks
about human motivation
so I like the idea of helping everybody
and getting everybody into Healthcare I
just don't know how to do it
and I'm not going to lie and say that
you know math is Magic and I I can
figure out how to do it in a way the
country will accept it's the country
accepting a part that's the hard part
um
so
here's something that
Democrats got very wrong
and it's so obvious in hindsight it's
painful and it goes like this
what they wanted to do with they
Democrats and progressives wanted to
reform the justice system
such that the number of black people in
America who were sent to prison is gets
a little closer to the percentage of
black people in the public
now in order to do that unfortunately
just because of the percentages of crime
in whatever demographic groups in order
to do that it requires
it requires
letting people out of jail who are
necessarily going to commit more crimes
we're not putting them in jail in the
first place am I right I mean that the
that is not in dispute
that in order to get some kind of
what you would call racial balance I
guess in jail
it requires letting out a lot of people
who will do more crimes
now
who are those people being let out well
specifically they're trying to get
people of color to be less represented
in jail I guess and so if you're letting
out a lot of black
known criminals
back into the community will they commit
more crimes well yes because many of
them are career criminals so a career
criminal doesn't do one crime and then
stop they do crimes until they get
caught
so if you put one criminal uh in prison
how many victims do you save
dozens
hundreds depends on the criminal right
so for every good deed which is not
let's say a Good Deed from the
perspective of the left some people on
the left the good deed would be not
putting somebody in prison
if you can avoid it
but unfortunately that requires because
of why math
and human motivation
the human motivation is if somebody's a
career criminal and they're not in jail
what is their motivation
do more crime
create more victims
right and how about the math
the math is that one person that you
helped by not putting them in jail
created seven people
I'll just pick a number I'm just making
up a number created seven victims
who are
and this is the the messed up part
almost all black
so if you can save one black person from
going to jail
that's great if that one black person
then goes on to have a successful Life
as a productive member of society and if
you could identify just those people
well that would be kind of Awesome
in fact that's what the Trump
Administration tried to do by having the
the early release
because if you find somebody who's going
to work on let's say a a trade or a
skill you're probably finding somebody
who's a good bet
relative to a career criminal who's not
working on anything else right so you
should have been able to predict that by
trying to help
uh the segment of the world that is
mostly black people going to jail
you end up with seven times worse
outcomes for black people
and you've taken the pain away from the
person who's causing the problem and you
spread it to the victims who weren't
causing any problem
so
how does anybody who is a republican
ever lose an election again
do you know the only thing that could uh
screw up 2022
in 2024 is Trump talking
that's it
now when I said that you said to
yourself haha he thinks Trump will do
something dumb that will ruin a good
situation no no I mean that's always a
risk but that's not what I'm saying I'm
saying if he says anything
if Trump even just talks
they'll find a way to turn it into the
worst thing in the world right so he
can't he can't do anything
if Biden proved anything during the last
election he proved that the less we see
of the politician the more we like
I wouldn't have guessed that but I think
if you're already you know you're
already a known quantity the less they
see of you the better because otherwise
it's just giving you reasons to be
attacked
so uh
Scott has identified Peak Trump time
best to understand this don't know what
that means
uh if he's re-elected he'll have a
mandate he'll he'll always talk to the
Press Trump would
all right
and that
ladies and gentlemen is my show for
today no doubt the best analysis you've
ever seen of the Ukraine situation
and uh
No Doubt the best thing you've ever seen
in your life
um I'm gonna say goodbye to YouTube
and thanks for joining me
