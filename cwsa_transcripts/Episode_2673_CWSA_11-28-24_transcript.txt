let me get some comments going
here and then we're going to have a
show let me tell you not like the lazy
podcasters who taking the morning
off nope not
me I know you're going to be here
so damn it I'm going to be here too
all right good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization Thanksgiving
style this is going to be an amazing day
but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that is a
copper muger glass a tanker Cher Stein a
canten Jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee enjoy now for the unparallel
pleasure of the dopamine end of the day
the thing that gives you more oxytocin
than you've ever felt in your whole life
it's called the simultaneous s and it
happens
[Music]
now so
good well Paul I appreciate you every
day but especially today Owen appreciate
you like crazy Marcela
Erica appreciate you all like
crazy I'm not naming
everybody but I could I could name every
one of you and I would be quite happy
that I get to spend some time with you
every
day well president Trump has uh given us
his
Thanksgiving greeting Happy Thanksgiving
to all including the radical left
lunatics who have worked so hard to
destroy our country but who have failed
miserably
now the funny thing is that my robots
read news yesterday I anticipated this
and my joke was about Trump mocking
people while he was saying Happy
Thanksgiving nailed
it Joy Reed is telling uh people that
they have no reason to spend time around
Trump supporters and that they when the
holidays come there's no reason that
they should welcome them or be around
them at all
so in other words Joy Reed said that
democrats should stay the away from
Republicans does it feel like the entire
universe is starting to tilt my
way Joy Reed telling people to stay the
 away from Republicans she didn't
use the f word but she could have
because that was what she said she
actually said you should stay away from
them don't don't interact with them over
Thanksgiving with your family your
family you shouldn't inter interact
with okay well I think that's just good
solid advice from Joy
re here's something I didn't see coming
so you know how for the last year or so
I've been telling you that America needs
to create a habit of taking a walk after
dinner and you probably said to me Scott
that's boring stop saying you have to
take a walk after
dinner and now NPR has a big article
about how important it is to take a walk
after dinner what I didn't know is that
apparently it's very common in Europe
that's I guess it's a it's a normal
thing in Europe to take a walk after a
big meal and it's it's good for your
health in a bunch of ways I don't need
to tell you but did you know that on Tik
Tok this is interesting but there's a
viral Tik Tok there are viral Tik Tok
videos uh extoling the virtues of
walking after a
meal uh although they call them fart
walks
because they say that's a good way to
relieve
yourself
so when I started saying you should take
walks a year ago did you think it would
be an article in NPR and then viral on
TiK ToK by
now I swear to God I must be running the
simulation because I've never tried to
make a big deal out of taking a walk
before and now
a normal source and the Tik Tock Source
are both saying take a walk after
dinner I've got a feeling that Kenedy is
going to say something about that
too you will not be surprised that
there's yet another big breakthrough in
Battery Technology carbon nano2 powders
according to
noridge um you don't need to know too
much about except it's a South Korea
company and they made a big advance
with new carbon nanot
tubes Battery Technology it's
happening did you know that according to
the University College of London they
can now use AI to predict the outcome of
Neuroscience
studies before seeing the data or before
doing the
study so all they do is they say hey AI
we're going to study to see if this is
true or that is true and this is mostly
I think in the social domain not in the
a not in not in the physics kind of
experiment but more the social
psychology kind of domain and would you
be surprised to know that your large
language model
AIS can can guess the outcome about 81%
of the
time they don't even need to do the
experiment the AI can tell them what
it's going to do like all eight of 10
times now they kind of do need to do the
experiment but eight out of 10 times the
AI just tells them what the outcome is
going to
be now do you remember
how uh I always joke almost every day
actually on the show that the scientists
could have just asked me because it's
sometimes the answers are
obvious well that's what the scientist
said too so the scientist said that the
reason that the llms can deduce is
because that that knowledge is sort of
already in the world so all I'm doing is
looking at the world as I know it and
saying well the the world I live in I
can tell you what's going to happen with
that experiment and then it does but
that's exactly what the AI is doing the
AI is just looking at the world and
saying well based on everything we know
about the
world I can tell you how that that test
is going to
go for example there was a
study that showed that if you exercise
at least this is true in rats but they
think it might be true in people if you
exercise there's some kind of chemical
that gets released in your muscles
that's good for repairing your
nerves so nobody knew that exercise was
good for your nerves but suppose You'
come to me and you said Scott we're
going to do a study to find out if
regular exercise is good for your nerves
what would I have
said well let me see exercise is good
for 100% of everything it's ever been
tested for is it good for
nerves I'm going to say yes and that was
the answer the answer was yes well they
haven't done the study but they think
it's going to be true based on on rodent
studies but I'll tell you they don't
need to study it is
true well uh Eric former Google CEO I
guess he was on a he was on a podcast
with
uh you probably heard of him Scott
Galloway has anybody heard of Scott
Galloway yeah stop it I'm not the poor
man Scott Galloway well okay I am I am
the poor man Scott Galloway but he has a
podcast and uh they're talking about
teen boys who are falling in love with
AI girlfriends
um he says you put 12 or 13y olds in
front of these things meaning the AI
girlfriends and next thing you know of
course they're going to fall in
love um but here's the
thing aren't they thinking past the
sale aren't they just
assuming that falling in love with AI is
bad now you assume it too right don't
you assume they're falling you in love
with AI is
bad but is
it I'm going to be contrarian about
this um and the contrarian is I'm not so
sure it's completely
bad let's
compare let's say 12-year-old
13-year-old who uh is no longer hugged
by his parents cuz you know it's icky
they're 13 doesn't have a
girlfriend and and his guy friends are
kind of jerks and don't invite him
places but he can have this really good
relationship with an
AI are you telling me he's worse off
because remember he can't get a
girlfriend he's only 13
anyway he's not real popular with the
guy friends he could work on that but
it's not going to make a big
difference parents leave him
alone he's got he's got no source of
oxytocin basically it's it's a man
starving to death now that doesn't
happen to females at the same age if
you've ever noticed have you ever
noticed that kids hug a lot these days
have you noticed that with your
teenagers like when their friend show up
they're all they're all like hugging
each other like like they've I mean it's
almost crazy they're very
physical and I thought to myself it
seems like the girls are getting more
hugs of course
you know the girls will hog each other
when they get together the guys won't
hog each other but the guys will hug
girls if the girls are up for it if
they're good
friends so this 12-year-old or
13-year-old that they're worried about
has absolutely no source of healthy
human
contact and if you tell me that that kid
is worse off for having something that
simulates human contact and might feed
their their need for company or less
loneliness or
something I'm just not so sure it's bad
now if you said these AI girlfriends are
good for everybody I'd say well that's
not true obviously that's not true but
if you're telling me that they're bad
for
everybody I'm not so sure I think we
might find out that they're
medicinal actually literally medicinal
all right
prediction prediction coming there would
be such a thing as medicinal AI
friends I'll be the first one to tell
you this that there will be medicinal AI
friends your your therapist is going to
say to you someday have you have you
tried one of the AI
friends it's going to happen it's going
to be medicinal just like
weed all right Trump uh according to the
Daily Caller news Foundation Trump will
red direct billions in unspent funds
from Biden's climate loss to quote real
infrastructure well that sounds
positive uh then I saw another story
that said that U Trump could cancel 1.5
$1.4 trillion doll of Biden expenses on
day one just with executive orders and
my first thought was wow it's going to
be easier than I thought to get to that
you know two trillion they have to cut
it out at the budget and then you find
out what the what the money is for and
it's all stuff that people are going to
want it's also over 10 years so it's not
really 1.4 trillion it's 1.4 trillion
over 10 years so it's going to be kind
of hard to hit that hit that cost
reduction we'll see what
happens well the prosecution of Daniel
peny is looking like a travesty some
kind of
um it it's just weird as cernovich
pointed out this morning the news is
pointing out too that the prosecutor is
calling Daniel peny the white
man and throughout the trial he referred
to him as the white man now keep in mind
this is a trial in which 100% of the
people involved know exactly who Daniel
penny is by name why would he refer to
him continuously as the white man well
let me tell you
this uh we don't know how this is going
to turn out yet but I'm going to judge
my opinion of America on this case now I
realize America is a lot more than just
this one case but I'm going to judge I'm
going to judge America on
this and because if he goes
down America is broken and we didn't fix
it he he can't go to
jail well I I can't live in I can't live
like this we don't have to live like
this if he gets if he gets prosecuted we
should surround the jail I mean we
should put a million people on the on
the streets and say
stop stop this is purely racist now
because the prosecutor is obviously
racist it seems like they could
immediately appeal it and maybe that
would be enough so it's possible that
the normal
legal process
will get to the right place even though
it's a Travis travesty so far but
honestly I'm just going to judge America
on this if if if you can't get this
right America you got some work to
do all right
um so RF Bobby
Kennedy uh was on some some video
podcast and he was talking about uh what
the CDC what doesn't tell you about the
flu shot now remember my current opinion
of medical data is that it's all wrong
all of it just all wrong now some of it
might be coincidentally in the right
direction so maybe it's good for you to
take those things but honestly I don't
think that medical science has a way to
know what works that's my current
opinion there's some things that are so
obvious that they can get that right
right if it's the difference between
living and dying they can tell if you
died or not so those they probably get
right but I've got a feeling that
something like 60% of all the meds that
we routinely prescribe the data is
 that's my current current
opinion based on everything I know and
I'll tell you more about
that but here's what RFK JR says quote
people who take the flu shot are
protected against that strain of flu now
you already know that the flu becomes
one thing and then it rapidly changes to
other things we're talking about the
regular flu not Co just a regular
seasonal flu so that by the time you get
the shot you're all aware that the shot
no longer applies to that flu virus
right now that you already
knew but on top of that according to RFK
Jr and remember I don't believe any data
any medical data
so I don't believe his but I also don't
believe the opposite of his because
there's nothing credible in this field
um he says that if you got the flu shot
you're 4.4 times more likely to get a
nonflu inle infection it injures your
immune system so that you're more likely
to get a nonflu viral upper respiratory
infection and apparently there are
multiple studies that all have the same
conclusion had you ever heard
that now I don't think he's
lying but you know data I'm not sure I
trust the data but I'm sure it exists
you know it may be wrong but I'm sure it
exists do you believe there are multiple
studies showing that the ordinary
regular flu shot is not just bad for you
but way bad for you and doesn't do
anything good for
you now I getting the regular annual flu
shot maybe 20 years
ago I don't remember exactly when or
maybe I got one of them in between maybe
I got one of them I can't remember but I
stopped trusting
them because when I found out that um
they make the flu shot to take care of a
virus that it doesn't even apply by the
time by the time the season comes around
I thought wait a minute am i r reading
this wrong am I really reading that I'm
supposed to take a flu shot for a flu
that doesn't exist and can never exist
again and everybody knows it and the
answer to that is
yes that's that's the actual answer now
you all know that right we're you're all
aware that the flu shot doesn't even
apply to the flu that are current when
you take it it applies to the flu that
were current when they made it and that
could have been a year
ago you all knew that right now if I'm
wrong fact check me because I don't you
I'm not your doctor so ask your doctor
don't trust me about anything medical
and also don't trust your doctor no I'm
just kidding don't trust your doctor no
just kidding just
kidding all
right so that's pretty
scary all right are you ready for this
one
this is such a fun Thanksgiving because
the news is
all kind of confirming things that you
suspected so it's going to make you
sound
smart would you be surprised to hear and
uh I saw this on on the George account
on X and again you should follow
George he's just terrific in the
independent
reporting um there is really clear video
security video of a uh a worker stealing
a security access keys from the Maricopa
uh voting
Center like really clear you can see his
face clearly his whole body you can see
him walk over to where the the key fob
is you can see him pick it up you can
see him take it I think he took more
than
one went to another another desk took
another one now it looked to me like he
was handing them to somebody another
worker so here's the question I would
ask is he really stealing them because
that's what the story said or did
somebody say um make sure there no there
are no fobs left out tonight because the
janitor might steal them so could it be
that the temporary worker is um
unfairly unfairly accused and whoever he
was handing it to who was also some kind
of employee there had asked him to go
collect any they were laying
out to improve security instead of Steel
security so I'm going to put a question
mark next to this one because if we
learned anything from the the the Ruby
and whatever it was case you can't
always tell what's happening on a
video video is
not uh and and thank you I'm being I'm
being prompted in the comments the
employee the employee in question is a
black man do you think that had anything
to do with how people are receiving it
well I think George is black himself
he's the one who's reporting on it so
there's no reason that race should be
any part of it but I
wonder I wonder if people are a little
bit more likely to think something's up
because it was a black man you know you
know I'm I'm one who says we shouldn't
have affirmative action in Dei but that
doesn't mean that systemic racism isn't
real and there's still a little extra
little extra distrust in some
categories so I'm going to put a
question mark on that one I don't think
that I can guarantee that we saw theft
but we could guarantee that we saw
somebody who worked there picking up
fobs and hand them to another
employee I think it's an employee
um here's something that I'm feeling a
little bit alarmed about so I've told
you publicly now several
times that uh if you're a trump
supporter you have a
responsibility to make sure that he
doesn't laware the other
side because we can't just have a we
can't have a government where Trump gets
lawf fared practically to
death survives and then just just turns
into the monster that he was trying to
defeat that's not cool
so as soon as you see even a whiff of
anything that feels like potential
lawfare I think we we have a
responsibility to call it out and say wh
Not My Name don't do this in my name now
here's where it gets and and I haven't
seen Trump do that by the way but here's
where it gets in the gray area Elon Musk
is definitely doing that now he's not
elected and he has free
speech so it's a little gray area but he
has said recently that uh on Wednesday I
guess he suggested that Lieutenant
vinman committed treason and quote will
pay after the Trump you know Trump uh
gets in
power uh he says vinman's on the payroll
of the Ukrainian oligarchs and committed
treason against the United States all
right here's my
problem Elon in his current role is no
longer just a citizen talking about the
news if he were just a citizen talking
about the news I'd say that's okay these
are unproven
allegations but it's within the realm of
free
speech when you're as powerful as musk
is now and I don't know that he's fully
understanding his position because
because it happens so fast it takes a
while to understand you know something's
changed in your own
situation when I see somebody who some
people think is the you know like Shadow
president I don't think that by the way
Trump is firmly in charge for sure um
but other people see him as like almost
a co-president at this point and again
that's not my opinion he's not a
co-president but but he has to know that
he's seen that
way and when you're seeing that way and
you call out the
person and the crime before any kind of
um legal processes started I say this is
too
far so here here's my
opinion uh Elon Musk too far I'm not
comfortable with
this now is it legal yes is it free
speech Yes it's completely within the
rules but I'm not comfortable with
it if if you give me a name in a crime
before the legal system is as DET
determin the crime is there no not in my
name I I don't want to be associated
with
that now I'm a private citizen and I'm
not associated with the government so I
do think vinman has some explaining to
do but I'm not aware of a specific
crime I'm not aware of one so that's why
I'm so uncomfortable if it were somehow
some super obvious thing then maybe but
on top of that Elon Musk has
also uh said about Reed
Hoffman that he's he's concerned that
Reed Hoffman has some explaining about
Epstein
Island again if he were speaking as a
private citizen and technically is
that's okay okay I mean it's it's going
pretty far you better have good lawyers
but he
does
so but when he's this close to power and
he calls out the name of an individual
who's a political
adversary and essentially accuses him of
the worst possible
crimes I'm I'm not comfortable with that
not in my name right so America is my
brand so so Elon Musk
is is part of what makes my brand and
and how I feel about
America and uh I'm you know over the
toop positive about Elon Musk and his um
and the work that he's offered to do at
Great personal expense and risk to to
help the government so I couldn't
possibly be more positive about musk and
everything he's doing for the country
but he deserves our
our useful
guidance meaning that the opinion of the
of the the opinion of the country
matters right sometimes you need to
ignore the opinion of the country to get
something done but this isn't one of
those cases this is one of those cases
where listening to the public might give
you a little
Advantage so I just want to go first in
case anybody else was having the same
feeling this is a little it's a little
too close to lawfare it's all legal it's
all legal but just understand that when
you get this close to power everything
changes and you need you need to
adjust your your speaking to the change
this is something I learned the Hardway
when I first became
famous um you know I had the experience
of being you know ordinary Citizen and
then suddenly the news was talking to me
talking about me a lot because of
Dilbert and so I became a public
figure and what I didn't realize at the
time is that you can't talk the same way
when you're a public figure so all of
the little opinions that I had when I
was you know literally just one of the
anonymous people in the public they were
all
fine so I could say for example that I
was good at something and that I was bad
at other things and people would say oh
you're good at that and you're bad at
that got it but once you become famous
for doing something something that's
working out well you can no longer say
you're good at
something because if you are you're like
some
egomaniac and I'd be thinking wait a
minute it's just the same opinion I've
always had but now it sounds gross now
it sounds like I'm just an oh oh
you made it but isn't that nice yeah you
you
so I also I think I've told you this
story I had a friend who was part of a
large company you've heard of that um
went public at one point and he made I
don't know maybe half a billion dollars
one day so he went from just somebody in
the neighborhood who had a pretty good
job to half a billion and by now it
would be at least a
billion and uh uh actually asked me for
advice about how to navigate suddenly
being in this situation
and I told them here's what you got to
do if you're if you're walking outdoors
and you step in some dog that's
your
story that you go with that you're on
the way to a party and you step in dog
 so when somebody says hey how you
doing you can't give your honest answer
because the honest answer was I flew in
in the private plane that I purchased I
just came in from my ski chalet in the
richest part of the country and uh I
think I'm going to have a massage later
yeah I made that part
up um because you would just want to
punch him cuz because his whole family's
life went from ordinary to oh my God so
instead I said talk about the dog
if you walk in they go hey how you doing
oh my God I just stepped in dog
this is I'm do I smell bad it's going to
be terrible blah blah blah and then
funny
happened um a a mutual friend showed
up uh and as soon as the mutual friend
walks in he sees he sees the newly Rich
mutual friend he goes hey how's it doing
going and the newly Rich friend looks at
him and without cracking a smile he goes
I just stepped in a bunch of dog
 and the other friend goes oh that's
too
bad and the funny thing is he never told
him it was a joke
and it worked perfectly it worked
perfectly because it it immediately took
the rich guy down to everybody else
everybody steps in dog so my advice
to Elon Musk is obviously he's learned
how to communicate as the richest person
in the world because he's had some
practice but he hasn't had a lot of
practice being
basically a roommate in the Oval Office
if you're going to be a roommate in the
off Oval Office you're part of my
brand and it's my request because I have
you know great respect for what he's
doing but it's my
request that You' be real careful about
the law
fair that that's important to
us all
right
um speaking of medical stuff I can't
give you the details on this but I did a
deep dive yesterday because somebody
sent me a provocative document and said
hey you should read this and I thought
maybe I will and
uh and there's a reason I can't give you
the detail I'll hope you'll accept that
but it was uh about a big medical field
you know something you've heard of a
well-known medical field and how they
how they look at the data in that
field and it took me about a minute to
realize the ire field was
fake and I can't tell you what it is
because I'll go to jail and people will
stop talking to their doctors and but if
you think you've seen the tip of the
iceberg I don't think you
have I I think we have only scratched
the surface when we're talking about
these annual flu shots that RFK JR says
he has data that says it's worth bad for
you I don't know if that data is right
or wrong but I could tell you the stuff
that I saw was clearly in the domain of
misinterpreted
statistics like really misinterpreted
like even you and I could tell it
wouldn't be hard to tell you just have
to look what they did look how they talk
about it and you would say oh my God you
know how how concerned you are about the
number of people who transitioned who
maybe wish they wouldn't and you say to
yourself this this is extra bad because
it was surgery and you know permanent
changes it's that level it's not that
topic it's a different topic but it's
that level that there there's something
going on in the United States at a level
of medical
malpractice that if what I'm seeing is
true I'm not going to be able to stay
quiet about
it I don't know if it's
true but man there's there's some coming
down the
bike anyway um let's talk about daylight
savings time did you know according to
Andrew huberman
PhD that uh the uh the chief of the
section on light and circadium
rhythms can you believe that the United
States employe somebody whose job as
chief of the section on light and
circadium
rhythms okay um I think that's a
government job um said that the the
taxpayer allowed discoveries now that's
huberman's um way to say that your
government taxes paid for some studies
they apparently all make it clear that
uh changing the time is bad for people
because it takes people too long to
adjust and the the hit on their uh the
hit on their bodies isn't worth the the
squeeze the juice isn't worth the
squeeze yeah let's go with that
so does that sound right to
you somebody's saying 100% of cancer
patients die of treatment not actual
cancer I don't think that's true um
because if you look at just um breast
cancer
alone I mean that that's curable in many
cases so I I'm not so somebody in the
comments said that cancer is killing
people with the treatment not the you
know not the cancer
I think there might be some of that I
don't know what percentage but clearly
there's some cures I feel confident
there's some cures that
work uh anyway what do you think
daylight savings
time I have mixed emotions because every
time the time changes I feel like I'm
happy about
it I I don't realize that I'm also
unhealthy but I have I have weird
sleeping patterns so you know it doesn't
feel like it's killing me but maybe it
is anyway again it's medical information
so I don't know how how accurate it is
but I'd be open to not changing it it's
something we could experiment with right
couldn't we do a five years
of oh oh you want you want to hear a
high ground here's a high
ground uh suppose you're in a government
meeting and somebody says we should
change the you know change our policy
and not do daylight savings time and
somebody else says yes we should and
here's our reasons and then you've got
two people who both have
reasons and they both sound pretty good
and you don't know which way to go so do
you make a change if you've got
arguments on both
sides do you make the change or
not well here's how I end that meeting I
wait till everybody's tired and they
realize they can't reach an agreement
and then I say at the end of the meeting
this is called The High Ground maneuver
there there are lots of forms of it so
it's not always exactly like this here's
The High Ground I wait till everybody's
tired five minutes left in the meeting
and I go you know what we should do
since it doesn't look like we're going
to be able to agree whether this works
or not why don't we try it for five
years and then really measure
it and then everybody shuts up and they
all look at each other like
why wouldn't we just try
it does anybody have a reason we
couldn't just try it for 5 years then
we'd know for sure that's The High
Ground you sound like the dumbest person
in the room if you say for sure you
shouldn't do it or for sure you should
as soon as somebody says well why don't
we just try for five years and do a good
job of measuring the difference
everybody else sounds
dumb because even if are for it or
against it you probably are not that
much against testing
it that's The High
Ground all right um three weeks after
the election was over Democrats are
pulling ahead in
California so I don't know is there one
or two uh seats that went from oh
Republicans are ahead but we're still
counting oh the Gap is closing a
littleit that but we're still counting
oh that gapff is closing a lot now still
counting oh it's about tie now it's
about tie well look what happened can
you believe it the Democrat got a few
more votes and I guess we're done
counting
now
now it's
possible it's possible that there was
nothing unto word about this
situation it's possible that there's
just some inefficiency some special
cases
something came up that's not normal and
they're just doing the best they can to
deal with a little delay and maybe some
obstacles that's possible don't you
think it's possible it's just an
innocent mistake or an innocent
inefficiency that got the right answer
but just took a little while
maybe but uh here's my
take if you if my state this is my state
California if my state wants to send me
a signal this strong that they're
cheating I'm not going to ignore
it
okay now I don't know what's true but if
you send me a signal this strong that
you're cheating on the election I'm
going to believe you're cheating on the
election and I'm not going to feel bad
about it if later I find out I'm wrong
because there's two problems here one is
are you cheating on the election
separate problem two why the are
you making it look exactly like you're
cheating on the election why the
are you telling everybody you're
cheating on the election even if you're
not I don't know if you are but why are
you making it look like you are you
don't have to do this there's no
reason you have to do this oh I told you
I wouldn't swear because it's
Thanksgiving send the children
away yeah no so I'm going to make the
assumption that California's race was uh
rigged my my reasoning is that they're
sending the signal it's rigged they're
sending the
signal don't tell me that I don't know
what really happened because I don't I
agree I don't know what happened I just
know that California's government is
sending me the strong signal that
they're cheating so that's what I'm
going to believe I've lost all
credibility in the election system in
California so great job
guys meanwhile in Australia the
parliament has banned social media for
children under
16
huh what do you think of
that first impression yes second
impression would be well they're going
to use it anyway they'll just get I
don't know vpns or lie about their age
or something use use somebody else's
account I don't know definitely worth
trying so high ground let's try
it now now we don't need to try it
necessarily we could wait a year and see
if it worked in Australia and if there's
something that would we'd have to tweak
to make it work here
maybe but uh I love the fact this being
experimented
with meanwhile uh Mark Zuckerberg
reportedly visited maral Lago to meet
with
Trump of
course because we're all bad people we
say St like he's there to kiss the ring
or kiss Trump's ass and beg for
forgiveness I don't think that's what's
happening now clearly it's the right
move if you're
Zuckerberg and you run a company that's
that important to the conversation in
America yes you you should be on a
firstname basis with the president all
the presidents you know you you have
that kind of job where you should Step
Up say let's have a meeting right away
so should Jamie Diamond so should
everybody who runs the social media
Network right so it's no big surprise
but the extra element is that Zuck seems
to have maybe transition from a crazy
Lefty supporting guy to a hey maybe a
little Common Sense makes sense and
maybe a little Common Sense makes you
look like you're a trump supporter in
2024 so he's never said he's a trump
supporter and I don't think he
will I think he'd be a mistake he he
should just try to keep neutral no
matter what he thinks privately um but I
like everything about this and since I'm
an optimist mode uh I'm going to say
that probably what Zuckerberg is saying
to Trump this is just speculation I
can't read anybody's mind so I don't
have any special Insight but here's just
what I
my take from both
characters Trump can work with
anybody that seems to be true so Trump
is always ready to say bygones or
bygones what can you do for me now so I
think Trump was
transactional you know maybe he gave him
a hard time for things that he did
because that's Trump But ultimately how
he decides to go forward would almost
certainly be transactional in other
words he would want Facebook to be doing
the right thing and make money for the
country and you know just be good
citizens
basically and I think
Zuckerberg may be influenced by the
pirate ship he's watching people who are
not typically Republicans you know
traditionally um come over and add
tremendous tremendous value like the
kind of value we've never seen really
I've never seen anything like it if you
look at what RFK Jr wants to do what
Elon wants to do what V wants to do even
what I assume Tulsi gabard will do in
her new
job these are contributions to America's
well-being
they're just incredible I mean the these
are people who are putting their bodies
on the line they're risking their their
actual lives you know their reputation
their lives their happiness their what
could be the retire ment in at least one
case and uh I've got a feeling that that
the animal spirits of the
country probably are affecting
Zuckerberg in exactly the way you'd want
them to meaning that I wouldn't be
surprised if Zuckerberg is f is trying
to find how he also can help the country
like what can we do to work together you
know how do we make this work without
distorting Free Speech or anything else
that we don't want to do so my guess is
that Zuckerberg and Trump is a
plus that's my guess I think Zuckerberg
wants to be he's very Pro America and
he's seeing that America is leaning in
One Direction hard and he could be part
of making that great he could be a
really big part so I think this is just
all positive to
me well here's a confirmation of
something that I can't remember if I
said this out loud
maybe you can tell me if I predict that
this out loud those you've been watching
but uh Mark Andre was on Joe Rogan show
there are so many good clips that came
out of that if you see any of the clips
of Andre talking to Rogan just watch all
of them every one of them is a winner
every single clip that came out of that
is like what
really it's really good um but
anyway uh Andre said he he had the most
alarming meetings he's ever been in
recently in which it became clear that
our government was telling the big
investors don't invest in small AI
companies because we're not going to
allow them to succeed there will only be
a few big AI companies and they will be
completely controlled by the
government and that's how it's going to
be now that's actually something that
apparently the government is telling the
top Silicon Valley investors so there's
no there's no ambiguity about it AI will
be controlled by your
government that conversation's
over so there you go so here's the
question did I not tell you a while ago
that every government controls its news
entities sometimes you just don't know
it but whether you're a Democrat
government government or parliamentary
or a dictator you really can't survive
without completely controlling the news
so that's what we have in America it's
what we have everywhere it's controlled
news you have to keep your country sort
of in the same direction and sort of in
the same opinion or the country falls
apart and the only way to do it
apparently is to have fake news all the
time but on top of that I believe I
expect speculated out loud but this is
what I want to ask did I speculate out
loud that AI would have to be it would
just have to be completely controlled by
the
government did I ever say that out loud
or did I just think it really hard and
thought about it so you tell me in the
comments but to me it's been obvious for
a long time that AI could not just be a
free market product it was too dangerous
and it could tell you the truth AI has
the ability to cut through the fake news
so if you accept that the government
every government and again unless say
it's good or bad I'm just saying it's a
fact that there's no government that
could survive real news because the real
news could overwhelm the you know
whatever they're trying to get done
so if you have to control the news to be
a successful country it follows very
easily that you have to control AI
because AI would look at the news and
say well that's not
true right the AI would would you you
could just feed it an hour of
MSNBC and say all right can you take out
the fake news and tell me what's left
and you like give you it give you like a
five seconds of oh there's a
hurricane everything else was
fake so of course the government has to
completely control AI every government
will do the same if you think that
China's not going to completely control
it you're wrong if you think there's
some country in Europe where they're
going to let their let their industry
just run wild with AI you're wrong there
will be no country that will allow AI to
be free because it's way too
dangerous so Mark Andre uh confirming
that that's actually already the case
the government's already said don't even
think about startups we're going to kill
them
all I mean
incredible anyway um so you know I keep
talking about Scott Jennings doing a
good job in CNN of supporting the right
leaning world and apparently he's become
quite the viral sensation because all of
his Clips seem interesting but according
to Mario Nall he's reporting next today
that uh Scott Jennings Clips are getting
more audience than CNN is
natively let me say that
again for any given hour of
CNN the number the total number of
people watching the news program for
that hour even in prime
time are not as much as the number of
people who watch the Scott Jennings
Clips mocking the other people at the
table for being
idiots that's the world I want to live
in thank you thank you Scott Jennings
and I say again the Scots are doing a
good job Scott Pressler Scott
Jennings Scott Galloway he's even doing
a good job all the
Scots
um I don't know if you've watched
Coleman Hughes was on a couple of shows
um yesterday today because I think
Walmart was getting rid of Dei and
Coleman is a uh young black American who
does not buy into all the left-leaning
Black American kind of standard stuff
he's more the common sense guy so I
don't even want to say that he's
Republican or right leaning because I
don't see a trace of it all I see is
somebody who's common sensical so I
don't even know I I don't I don't know
if he's registered one way or the other
but imagine watching somebody on CNN
talking about an important topic in the
news and when they're done you can't
tell who they voted
for that's pretty good right so Coleman
is one of those and that is impressive
anyway he had two hits if you see his
Clips on X you should watch him he is so
good
um presenting his position now remember
I told you
that people don't interrupt me in
interviews you see a lot of talking over
somebody will say something and get a
lot of talking over and I've always told
you that if you don't say crazy
then that won't happen to you it's only
when you say something that invites the
talk over that you get to talk over if
when you listen to Coleman
Hughes everybody stops and they listen
to every
word and the reason is he doesn't say
crazy and the whole thing makes
sense and holds together it's just
common sense and so watch watch his
interviews and watch how everybody just
listens it's really kind of
impressive
um but uh what he said was he was
talking about Joe Rogan and Joe Rogan I
guess the CNN and MSNBC or type people
are saying that that Joe Rogan somehow
used to be left leaning but then he
became right leaning and Coleman of
course
uh he challenged that view and he
mentioned a bunch of views that uh Joe
Rogan has always had and and still has
and and he challenged them to give any
example where um where Joe Rogan had
changed his mind and nobody had an
example so he basically clowned the
entire panel not a single person had one
example where Joe Rogan had ever changed
his mind
does Joe Rogan still think a marijuana
should be
legal yes yes did he suddenly find
Jesus no no he didn't change anything
absolutely everything is the
same
anyway good job
Coleman
um Microsoft stock took a little hit it
wasn't too big of a hit so I guess the
FDC is going to do some major Anti-Trust
investigations um
full full disclosure I owned some
Microsoft stock which I bought during
the pandemic just because it was down
and I figured ah everybody needs windows
so it's going to come back up so uh I
didn't know that it was going to do AI
at the time but I got it lucky because I
bought it
before before the AI connection was
announced uh but investors are spooked
and I guess they're
taking some money off the
table um there are two stories about
what happened with Trump calling the
Mexican president Claudia shine
bomb about the Border Trump says that
during the phone call that the president
of Mexico agreed to close the southern
border after he threatened her with 25%
tariffs now of course that's a a perfect
Trump story like that's that's the one
you want to be
true and it would also be perfectly in
the new
CEO uh mold which would be get something
done before he even starts his first day
in the job nobody better he's the best
in the
world of presenting the first
impression I've never seen anything like
this so but Shan bom pushed back on that
and said she rejected the claim that
their conversation resulted in quote an
immediate border closure
she said in our conversation with Trump
I explained to him the comprehensive
strategy blah blah blah to address it
respecting human
rights now what Trump said was clean and
clear and
specific what the president of Mexico
said was ambiguous indirect and sort of
global
philosophical did they really disagree
I don't think so here's what I think
happened I think Trump said you're not
sending any more Caravans and Mexico
said
okay and then he probably said you know
make sure you're not letting people
cross illegally and then she probably
said something like well we do that
anyway we're trying as hard as we can to
make sure nobody's Crossing
illegally and then he probably said
we're GNA have to do something about the
Asylum situation because at the moment
Mexico can send zillions of people
through legally they just have to claim
Asylum now later if the Asylum claim
doesn't work they would have to go back
but that could be years from now so it
could
be that uh the things that can be
stopped immediately like the Caravans
will be stopped immediately it could be
that he maybe gets a little extra action
in you know the the purely illegal
Crossings
but that's a gray area it could
be that they agreed they had to talk
about the Asylum you rules and
situations and if we don't change that
it's going to be a problem so um I think
that she was talking the Mexican
president was talking to the Mexican
public to make it seem like she didn't
get rolled over in negotiations by
Trump trump I think was just telling you
what happened
cuz he's he's in the cat Bird's seat so
he can just tell you what happened I
think she had to spin it a little bit so
I don't I don't believe that Trump
successfully closed the Mexican border
with one one phone call I don't believe
that at all I do believe he probably
ended the um the big groups you know the
the Caravans probably did that and that
would be a big deal but lots of work to
do but I'm only speculating what
actually
happened um I I saw Tucker Carlson was a
some video talking to somebody and he
said he might be interested in a guest
Press Room uh appearance so he laughed
he laughed at the idea that he would be
the press secretary for the president
and you know do the briefings because
that would make no sense doesn't make
sense that his age or where his career
is so it doesn't make sense um but he
did say he'd be open to being a guest
press
spokesperson so now there are two
stories going on about the president one
Don Jr has confirmed that conversation
has happened about adding maybe some
Independent News people such as you
would think of as
podcasters but some of them are
legitimately independent investigative
news people as well and he's thinking of
maybe get rid of some of the some of the
it's crowded room you can't just add
people um so you might get rid of some
of the standard ones and add some
non-standard ones you know what I think
make the room a little bit bigger please
or have two of them or something I I
feel like they're making all their
decisions based on the size of a
room that's the wrong way to do it it
should be what do you want to happen and
then you find a place you can do that
thing it could be that your best
situation is to have some big screens so
that um By Invitation some Independents
can come in and just be on the wall and
everybody can see them and hear them and
they just ask their question from the
wall
TV now not all The Independents are
going to have a budget to send somebody
to go sit down there just in case they
have a press conference right but they
could all call into a number so
uh I'd like them to start with what they
want to accomplish and then figure out
how to do it I don't want them to start
with our room is too small so we're
going to have to get rid of Time
Magazine to add Joe
Rogan how's that make sense right
remember Trump is supposed to be the
common sense president let's Common
Sense this yes I would like to see
Tucker come in one day yes I would like
to see the independent podcasters be
included
I don't need the people there to be
excluded I I don't need them to get rid
of CBS News so let's just do the common
sense thing you know maybe maybe just a
little addition is the better
idea anyway so most of you by now have
seen the clip of kamla Harris when she
surfaced to say don't let anybody steal
your power after Trump had stolen all of
her power because no nobody can steal
your power as she sat there powerless
because her power had been
stolen um but here's my here's what's
interesting about
it during the election I would have said
well she's drunk as a skunk and other
people would say yeah maybe maybe not
but didn't really make a big deal about
it it was like somehow it didn't
matter but I feel that the at least the
reaction on the right uh of every single
person who saw that video is that we
could tell she was
inebriated would you
agree that it is a common sense common
knowledge among the politically active
right that KLA Harris has appeared
inebriated on something a number of
times in public including this one for
sure is that is that fair to say because
that kind of went from I think that went
from
B basically just me saying
it well is that
true what was anybody else saying that
she was appearing in public drunk before
I did I don't remember anybody saying it
before I did did anybody a public
figure I I I'm going to need a fact
check on that so some one of you who has
like a like a really good memory and and
you've watched all my shows and you've
also paid attention to the news were
other people saying she's obviously
drunk before I
did um well you watch the comments
yourself and see if anybody
did I I know a lot of people were saying
it at the same time but did anybody say
it before me because I feel like I might
have made it
safe it might have made it a little
safer to say because some you know hey
somebody else is saying it
uh there's a little disagreement I don't
think we can tell for
sure but if there if you I'll tell you
what if you can find a a post on X where
somebody called it out before I
did but you'd also have to find my first
post you know it's hard to actually
search for your own posts have you found
that I don't think grock does a good job
of searching your own your own posts
anyway I'm curious about that the reason
I'm curious is that I like to track uh
um whenever I may have had some
influence over a
topic and it's hard to know because a
lot of things would happen by
coincidence and they could happen for
lots of reasons so um the only way I
would know is if I beat like I got it in
first that's the only way I would have
some some idea that maybe I made a
difference all right so doesn't matter
but it'd be nice to
know uh apparently Ray EPS is
information lawsuit against Fox News has
been dismissed but without reasons that
we've heard I'm going to put this I'm
going to put this news item under the
category of um and it won't be the first
one I might have three stories in a row
in which the only comment I could make
is H okay so let me say it again the
federal judge just dismissed Ray's
defamation lawsuit against
Fox let's say he was claiming
the Fox News was claiming he was a
Fed so if he wasn't a
Fed which seems like something you could
prove why would they drop
it just makes you go now I I I've never
claimed he's a had because I feel like
that would be unfair cuz he's a citizen
and innocent till proven guilty but
why did that get dropped right after
Trump gets
elected here's another
one according to KABC there was a fire
in the Hollywood Hills and they believe
that a member of the Rothschild family
will Rothchild was killed in the house
fire well that would be very tragic and
I hope that nobody died in the fire and
I hope it was just wrong news new but a
Ross child does that name come up
recently and then there's a story about
Al
Sharpton who as you know was paid half a
million dollars to his charity uh before
he did a softball interview with KL
Harris which of course would be a giant
ethical problem with his own network but
um it seems like the most as Megan Kelly
says quote this is a massive ethical
breach by Sharpton and
MSNBC there is zero question that
Sharpton should be fired for this taking
half a million dollar donation from a
presidential campaign right before you
interview the candidate and you don't
disclose it
please
interesting so do you think they have a
Dei problem
[Laughter]
there's no way to know but let let me
put it in these
terms if Chris Hayes who is also a host
on
MSNBC if he had received a half a
million
dollar from a candidate before giving a
softball
interview how fired would he be by now
Chris AES he's a white guy very
fired very fired does anybody doubt that
is there anybody here who thinks Chris
AES could have gotten away with that and
by the way Chris Hayes if you're
listening I got you
back no Chris haes would have been fired
in like five
minutes but if you're the Dei
Network and you don't want to lose the
few prominent black voices that you
have maybe you have some other
considerations so what do I say about
this
story and that ladies and gentlemen is
all I have to do to say about the news
and my prepared comments I would like to
take this day of Thanksgiving to thank
all of you for
collectively boosting my
signal uh allowing me to have this what
I consider very social
interaction and uh you're the coolest
thing about my life right now so this
this is what I like doing um I still
like drawing my comics and stuff so I'll
keep doing that of course but this is
what I
love this is what I really love and if I
can help any of
you get health ithier stronger fitter
better looking calmer have less
ADHD understand the news better love
your country a little bit more and of
course get your Dilbert 2025 calendar
that you can only get at the link at
dilbert.com
um then I'm down for
it so there will be lots happening in
the coming year it's going to be quite
eventful I promise you and uh we're
going to slay some dragons
uh I hear dragons are real according to
Joe Rogan by the way I'm practically at
the point of believing in dragons
because some of the I've seen in
the last week my
God I actually was sitting there the
other day thinking maybe dragons are
real I mean I mean some of the things
that I've seen have been
incredible so big thank you to all of
you um I am expecting they'll do some
live streaming uh during the middle of
the day I have a time for that yet but
probably in and around the time most of
your family is gathered at your houses
or whatever and uh when I do the
Thanksgiving one um I will probably be
demonstrating drawing a comic so for the
young people uh who might have some art
interest I will teach them how to use
the equipment I use I use a um computer
input and uh I will teach them how to
write
and I will teach them how to draw this
is something I do more regularly on my
uh for my local subscribers they've seen
this a few times but I did something
that I don't know if has ever happened
before the last time I did this I
actually um showed the audience the
writing of it before the drawing of it
now I don't know that anybody's ever
done that before because it's it's doing
Comics is a lonely oneperson
job like if there's anybody else there
it's hard to do so doing it publicly
with an audience and coming up with a
joke and then executing it and it was
the Sunday that ran last Sunday uh I
think it came out pretty well so if you
haven't seen a comic written and drawn
from
scratch it's kind of interesting you
know if you have any interest in that
domain so if you got a young people uh
look for the show it'll be on X and
YouTube and Rumble and locals at the
same time I'll be using the the studio
here so we do it and could be cool so I
hope everybody enjoys it all right
everybody that's all I got for
now um I'm going to go talk to the
locals people privately for a minute and
everybody else I will see you later
today I
hope all right locals are coming at you
privately in 30
seconds
