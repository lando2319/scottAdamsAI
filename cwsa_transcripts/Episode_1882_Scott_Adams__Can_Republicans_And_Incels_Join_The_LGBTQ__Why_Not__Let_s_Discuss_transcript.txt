cut
good morning everybody
and welcome
to what many will consider
the finest day of all the days that have
ever happened today
is awesome
not for any particular reason but we're
going to take it up a lot Notch anyway
and all you need to do that
is the right tools all you need is a
copper mug or a glass a tanker Chelsea's
Diner canteen Joe Garf Alaska vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure that dopamines
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now go
oh
and if you didn't know
the official coffee with Scott Adams mug
that's not this one
but it's going to be cooler than this
one uh will is available for pre-order
see my Twitter feed at the top
my pinned post and you can get yours too
yes yeah you can get a mug it's true
all right well uh
good job Florida
am I right
so DeSantis continues to show competence
in all realms
it's kind of impressive I got it met and
I feel like I'd say the same thing if
you were a Democrat
I feel like I would I mean you would
have different policies but
there's something that's just simply
capable about him
that is jumping off the page now some of
it is because
is is because you know it's pure
politics and he's doing things that look
good but it also seems like he's not
making errors am I right
so we're looking at the things he's
doing in the positive sense but I don't
I can't think of like a giant error he's
made
which is also notable given how much
scrutiny's under so Florida looks like
maybe they mounted the most capable and
competent Disaster Response of all time
oh yeah he's military somebody said yeah
that might make a difference you're
right
because when you think military you
think Logistics and this was the
logistics
um success so far now Florida's got a
lot of recovery but
um it's the most capable place around so
there we go
and as I tweeted yesterday and I'm sure
I know I wasn't the first person to
tweet this
but did you notice that yesterday there
weren't any Democrats or Republicans in
Florida
I mean there were plenty of Democrats
and Republicans talking about Florida
you know sitting outside of Florida
but but the people who are up to their
knees in water
they were they were not Democrats or
Republicans they were just floor
Floridians just people just citizens
and there are a lot of pain there are a
lot of photos of being of people being
um let's say pull down of danger and
taken to
uh safety
and do you know a lot of those pictures
have in common
you couldn't really tell for sure just
by looking at a picture
but let me just say this
the Republicans didn't stay home
I mean they were out pulling people out
of cars
so
uh and then the Democrats too of course
right I'm not I'm not showing favorites
I'm just saying that maybe this is one
of those times where you can just look
at the good stuff
and maybe focus on that for a while
uh
Thomas Massey had a wonderful moment at
in Congress here he was talking to the
CEO of Amtrak
and Amtrak still has a coveted
vaccination mandate for its employees
and Thomas Massey said would that would
they qualify if they got their two
vaccinations
20 months ago and the CEO said yes that
would qualify that would be that would
be vaccinated
and then Thomas Massey walked through
these cdc's scientific
scientific data or opinion I guess that
uh basically there would be no point
having vaccinations 20 months old
because the current variance plus the
fact that the vaccination wears off
takes it down to basically zero
Effectiveness for all practical purposes
and the CEO
the CEO when presented with what you're
doing doesn't make any sense according
to the government of the United States
in the most the most at least on paper
the most qualified to answer the
question
and the CEO bless his heart
instead of doing what he should have
done do you know what he should have
done at the very moment he got called
out when he was just dead
I mean I mean because Matthew is
actually reading the cdc's guidelines he
says after eight months you're down to
less than 20 Effectiveness you know
where do you think you are at 20 months
[Laughter]
for 20 months
it's ridiculous to have a mandate for a
vaccination
but the CEO instead of instead of doing
what he should have done
here's what he shut it up
there was only one way out and he didn't
take it here's what he should have done
you know I I think you make a good point
and I'm going to look at that as soon as
I get back
if he had done that
hero I mean he could have walked out of
there completely unscathed yeah you make
a good point let me I'll take a look at
that because we would love to get rid of
the mandates as soon as possible love to
get rid of the mandates but only when
it's scientifically
solid and what you're saying makes sense
to me but I haven't looked into it that
detail let me look into that and if a
change is necessary we'll make a change
now imagine if the CEO had said that
you would even accept that he had been
wrong up to that point wouldn't you
you would completely forgive that CEO
for having been wrong up to that very
moment the very moment this you know
that's a good point I'll look into that
and if that makes sense we'll make that
change right away
you would completely forgive it
but instead the CEO went with generics
you know what he went with well we
really care about our people and we want
to do everything we can then Massey
would point out but this wouldn't make
any difference it's just basically
annoying your employees with no benefit
whatsoever
well you know but the important thing is
we've done a good job we like to protect
people and Massey's like this has
nothing to do with what I'm what I'm
talking about like these generic
statements about awesomeness don't
really get to the question
think of Jordan Peterson's critics
and I think critic is
too strong a word for most of them I
guess there are two kinds so he Jordan
Peterson has some critics who are
actually smart people who have good
opinions
and just have some philosophical
differences
but mostly it's just people who want to
tear them down
have you noticed that
it doesn't yeah it seems entirely based
on jealousy
or the need to hurt anybody who
succeeded
because I feel like I get that I feel
like anybody who's in the public eye
gets the I want to hurt you because
you're successful
that's it and
I so wonder what it would be like to
talk to somebody in person because you
only see these people on Twitter people
don't act the same in person exactly
but I love I love to just have a
conversation and say how did Jordan
Peterson hurt you
Claire how are you damaged by the fact
that Jordan Peterson has millions and
millions of fans
and that he says things that people find
Value in
how does that hurt you like why are
people so butt hurt about somebody they
don't know
who is doing a valuable service to other
people they don't know
has nothing to do with them because
they're completely unrelated to it in
any way
anyway so that's that's sort of the
worst of humanity but I feel like
calling them critics
when what they're doing has nothing to
do with criticism does it
the and haters is too simplistic
I think you need some kind of new word
for somebody who's just angry at your
success
and I'm thinking dingleberries
because you got to take them seriously
like just dingleberries
they're just dingleberries but what
about that thing they said
who cares
what I'm not gonna I'm not gonna answer
a dingleberry
if you're a dingleberries good doc would
you have a conversation with them even
if they could talk no no you would not
so well I'm just gonna call him
dingleberries
uh speaking of dingleberries here's news
from my mascot Keith olberman now as you
know I convert
all the people who are my dingleberries
into uh mascots if they become notable
enough they get promoted to mascot
so Keith olberman has come after me
enough times that he's promoted to
mascot and I learned in a tweet of his
he was complaining about Kirsten Kirsten
Cinema
and and in his complaint about her he
mentioned that he dated her
so Keith olberman actually dated Kirsten
Cinema back in I don't know a while ago
and immediately I wondered
was that did he date her before or after
she became bisexual
because she's the first person in
Congress who's openly bisexual right
and I thought I'll bet she was totally
into men until she dated Keith Olbermann
and then when she was done she was like
I'm not completely done with men but
I think I could give women a try for a
while
just see what that's all about because
whatever this was it didn't work out so
try some of that other stuff for a
little while I can say it I can see it
uh I once uh dated somebody when I was
young who
well never mind
you know you don't care about that story
so Trevor Noah decided he's going to
leave The Daily Show
um I I think he's good you decided to
leave The Daily Show before the ratings
went to completely zero
so I guess under uh Jon Stewart The
Daily Show ratings were like 1.5 million
per show
and Trevor Noah was down into the 300
thousands so so we lost 80 percent of uh
Jon Stewart's uh
audience 80 percent
and now he's uh he's leaving after his
seven successful years of
uh reducing the show by 80 percent
so there's that but uh I saw a tweet
that noted that uh James Corden is also
equated his late night show Samantha B
she's out and Brian Williams is out and
Don lemon's moved on and now Noah uh
Trevor Noah is moving on and it all
coincides with
coincidentally
the rise of Gutfeld
so goffeld exclamation
uh he hit that time slot became the
number one show
in the time slot and then basically just
took out all the all the low performers
so basically he just wiped out the whole
swath of the the low
low hanging fruit there
yeah so quite a Powerhouse exactly quite
a Powerhouse
I had this conversation with uh a
Democrat on Twitter
who said that uh
who believes that conservatives dominate
uh the media
and the argument was that the number one
entities are conservative
you know Fox News number one entity and
and that any any conservative can get on
TV and have a giant audience and guffeld
number one show
and
I have these conversations with people
who can't do math and you can't win a
conversation with somebody who can't do
math
and I'm trying to explain all right
right
you understand have you ever heard the
word plurality
compared to majority
you know do you understand this concept
that you could be the biggest one and
still weigh less than half
you get that if there are a lot of
people in the field the biggest one
could have 20 percent
you know Trump had the 13 support when
he was in the primaries in the beginning
13.
that was more than the other people at
so that was enough
so
yeah I I can't even believe I have that
argument it was like and it didn't end
in one or two tweets
it just kept going and I kept thinking I
don't know I feel like I've made this
point
um
my worst prediction I've ever made and
I've had some real Clunkers I mean won't
you agree I've had some bad bad
predictions but here's the worst one
can't believe it
um before the election this last
election I actually said predicted if
Biden gets elected there's a good chance
you'll be dead in a year
uh it took two years
so I missed it by 100 percent
so I basically said there's a good
chance to be done one year
but it took two years to get the point
where a crime is out of control we're
talking about Mass starvation excess
mortality that we don't understand and
maybe nuclear Armitage Armageddon maybe
nuclear Armageddon but I'm going to say
that's my worst prediction because I
missed it by a year
like I said in a year
but it's been two years now that's
that's 100 missile so I apologize for
being so off on that crazy crazy
prediction
so I asked on Twitter for people to tell
me my best and worst predictions
and what I noted is that people don't
remember either my best or Worse
predictions
apparently you don't spend all of your
time memorizing what I do
but people remember
maybe one or two of them
so the people who remember the ones that
were wrong believe I'm always wrong
and the people who remember the you know
two that I got right but don't remember
anything else
they uh they believe that I'm right all
the time or most of the time
now it's amazing how quickly people can
form opinions if I said make a total
list of all the things I predicted and
how I did
most of you could not do more than five
items would I be right
if I said tell me all the things I've
predicted and then tell me if I got them
right or wrong probably about five items
wouldn't you say
about five
would you like to hear a list of the
actual uh correct predictions
or would that be too uh too
self-referential because I know too much
about myself is not what you came here
to hear
all right I'm gonna just read them fast
okay I'll just do a fast
uh I predicted Trump would win in 2015
before just about anybody
I predicted that Trump would not change
just politics but he would change
reality itself
the most awesome
the most awesome prediction anyone ever
made
that was correct that he would change
reality
I mean imagine just think about the
enormity of that
just the enormity of that to protection
and it was right
all right I predict that Trump's
policies would look better and better
the further we got away from his
presidency
correct correct
um I predict that these shy Trump voter
phenomenon now other people predicted
some of these things so I'm not claiming
I'm the only person who predicted them
I'm just saying that there were unusual
predictions incorrect so I got this shy
voter shy Trump voter thing everybody
all the experts said no that's not real
but at the moment everybody accepts that
it was real
I predicted that Jeb Bush was done the
same day I heard low energy
as his kill shot the same day I
predicted he was done and he was
nobody predicted that but me I'm the
only one in the world
um I predicted Carly fiorini's Peak
popularity the day that her polls were
the highest and would never be that high
again
I hit it like I think to the week
um I predicted the Las Vegas shooter was
not Isis even after Isis claimed credit
even after they claim credit I said it
wasn't Isis and it wasn't
um I predicted that vaccinations would
not work
same but you remember that right I
predicted that the vaccinations would
not work
and they didn't
but I did predict the Therapeutics would
probably save us and they probably did
that plus the virus attenuating
uh I predict that the fauci was lying
when he said that the the n95s wouldn't
protect you and I said specifically he
was lying because he was protecting the
supply
and I was right
now I'm not arguing about whether masks
work that's a different conversation I'm
arguing whether fauci lied any admitted
he lied
I I predicted the secret Sonic weapon at
the embassies would never be confirmed
as a weapon
certainly not a Sonic weapon and so far
no sign of a weapon
I said the Ukraine would be too hard to
conquer because of the modern military
stuff that they had I believe I'm the
only person in the world who got that
right
proved me wrong the only person in the
world who got that right and that was a
pretty bold prediction since everyone in
the world was on the other side
um I'll tell you the ones I got wrong in
a minute too because I know I know what
you're thinking I said Republicans would
be hunted people mocked me
how does that one look
does it look like they're looking for
Republicans it looks like that to me
um
all right I talked about good chance
you'd be dead in the air
um in 2018 I started saying that the U.S
needed to decouple its economy from
China what did everybody say in 2018
when I said we have to decouple our
industry from China
everybody said you're crazy
that's never going to happen
here we are
decoupling from China
probably the craziest thing I ever
predicted and it's happening
um
I predicted in 2018 that there was a
good chance of a middle east peace deal
when most people almost everybody
thought that was impossible
but I predicted a middle east peace deal
not counting Iran
and then the Abraham Accords happened
that was based on a prediction that
there were so many deal makers in office
at the same time so it was just sort of
a coincidence of timing that I thought
that could be possible
um
I predicted that Trump alone could calm
tensions with North Korea by befriending
uh Kim Jong-un and he did
I'm the only one I'm pretty sure nobody
else predicted that you know when I did
uh I predicted that Russia collusion was
a hoax you all predicted that too but
that was correct
um I predicted probably a dozen other
legal charges against Trump would be
would evaporate they all did
so far nothing
um I predicted that alcohol we someday
find out that the whole thing that
moderate drinking is good for your
health I predict that someday that would
be debunked now I'm not sure that's
totally debunked but the science is now
more mixed on that all right here are
the wrong predictions right
uh
so so so you can see the people were who
are damaged you can see them in the
comments so one of them is saying is is
commenting that this is an exercise in
the ego
there's something wrong with you isn't
there
like do you have an issue
because
if you're watching somebody who predicts
for a living
and then that person who predicts for a
living this is what I do I tell you what
I think is going to happen if I don't
check my work not really doing a good
job of predicting and and I haven't done
a good job of keeping my list so now I'm
going to tell you the ones I got wrong
will you have just as much of a
discomfort
would I tell you what I did wrong as
when I told you what was right
all right all right everybody who thinks
that what's happening now is me talking
about my ego
you have something wrong with you you
really do
you should be saying to yourself
is the record good or not and therefore
your credibility that you apply to me
should be adjusted based on my record
so I'm talking about you
right I'm talking about how you can have
a better idea of what the future would
look like by by judging whether I'm good
at predicting it
so so here's the ones I got wrong all
right I predicted that Trump would win
in uh 2020.
the reason that was wrong is I did not
see that the pandemic changes would have
as much change as they did and maybe
some other reasons but it was wrong
whatever reason it was wrong
and let's see what else uh I was wrong
about that I was wrong about Russia not
invading because I thought that Putin
would be at least as smart as I was
but it wasn't
so I was 100 wrong about Putin not
invading
um I said that Carla Harris would be the
toughest Democrat opponent so I thought
she would get the nomination instead of
Biden and Kamala instead was the first
one that got dropped down for being
terrible
so that's as wrong as you can be
although she did become president for
two hours but that doesn't make me right
I was wrong about Trump's VP Choice uh
he picked Pence I forget who I imagined
it would be
uh
uh and then a bunch I asked on Twitter
for people to tell me what I got wrong
and most of the answers were that I was
wrong about everything about predicted
everything I predicted about the
pandemic
but there aren't any examples of that
so there's a widespread belief that I
got everything wrong about the pandemic
there's no example of that I got
everything right about the pandemic I
was the most right about the pandemic by
far
and you can see I put the I put the full
description in my bio so look at my
profile on
look at my profile on I know you don't
believe it but look at my profile and
there's a link there where there's a
full description of what I said was
you know what I believed and then what
happened
you can see for yourself
so all the people who are talking about
my ego
you really do have some kind of mental
disorder
and I'm going to talk more about that
because there there's a group of people
who simply hate
anybody who is right
or anybody who is successful at anything
and what is it about it that makes that
so distasteful to you
those those of you who are concerned
about my ego right now
what is it that makes this such an
unpleasant experience for you
yeah I mean I think you you probably
need to think about some therapy or
something because if somebody telling
you what they got right and what they
got wrong
is a problem
you really need to look into that
because I would think that that's really
holding you back
you know if you think that my success is
offensive
how the are you ever going to
succeed seriously
yeah you must think that if you became
successful like me you'd be an
too right
is that what you think would it be
dangerous for you to do a bunch of
successful things
it would be dangerous wouldn't it
because that would be a blow to what you
think is good
because then you'd be like me oh oh my
God you got you got some things right
and you got some things wrong too but I
can't I can't deal with the fact that
you've got some things right even if
you've got a bunch of things wrong even
if you got 10 times things more wrong
than right
which is approximately my actual record
10 times more wrong than right
if you count businesses and you know
romance and everything else if you count
everything I've ever done
I fail about 10 times for every one time
I succeed and I've always said that I
wrote a book about it about failing 10
times and so and if that's threatening
to you is threatening to you that
somebody could fail 10 times
succeed once and you're like
 oh my God the ego on that guy
the ego on that guy he he succeeded one
out of ten times I can't believe it
seriously check yourself
all right
um what do you think is happening to the
uh matchup between the generic
Republican and the generic Democrat for
the midterms you remember it was only a
few short months ago that the GOP
had a pretty big lead
in the generic contest which is a
generic Democratic it's a generic
Republican where do you think it is now
according to the Rasmussen polling
organization
it's a tie
yeah there's a one point difference
basically a tie
so is anybody surprised
this is exactly what it was supposed to
do right it always says this
yeah yeah we're not surprised so every
every poll you saw six months ago that
said there was a big gap you knew that
Gap was going to disappear and also you
knew that Gap was going to disappear and
here's the real
you know mine spinner
you knew it wouldn't matter what
happened
right you knew
didn't matter what happened with covid
didn't matter what happened to the
Ukraine didn't matter what happened in
the economy didn't happen didn't matter
what happened with abortion it didn't
matter
not nothing in the policy or the
outcomes mattered
What mattered was people just went to
their team that's it
yeah they just voted for their team but
why they didn't vote for their team
earlier
yeah probably because it wasn't serious
right when it gets serious and you
actually can like visualize oh God maybe
the other team could win I don't want
that then suddenly your team starts
looking good again
somebody's saying notice this is about
me notice every time I get owned that I
move on quickly or I get angry and
switch to the topic who exactly was
owning me back then
the the somebody's did somebody see me
get owned
well what kind of weird hallucination
are you having though
somebody's asking me to explain the
tennis ball incident
so there's a story on Twitter
and I don't know anything about it but
there's a story on Twitter
that I once claimed that a tennis ball
disappeared
and I had my ex-wife I don't know which
one according to this story had to drive
me had to drive me to the emergency room
because I thought a tennis ball
disappeared
that's the story I saw on Twitter about
myself today
now
I'm pretty sure that didn't happen
[Laughter]
I'm pretty sure
that's actually true
there's somebody here who was telling me
that I don't know my own life well
enough
that I believe that there was a tennis
ball that disappeared
and that I went to the emergency room
because of it
what
SB says name one thing you got right
about the pandemic
um I'll do better than that go to my
profile and look at the document there's
an entire document of all of my opinions
and you can see both what I got right
and what I got wrong
and after you read that I'd like you to
come back and say oh
I didn't I didn't realize that you were
so right I was the most right about the
pandemic period
all right now is that ego
I don't know if I win a contest because
I have a higher score
I don't think it's ego to say I won the
contest here's my score
I mean you can score it yourself if you
find anybody who did better let me know
um
so let's talk about lizzo and the flute
um
the only comment I have about lizzo and
the flute is that
it makes me wonder if Republicans should
be added to the lgbtq
so I decided I'm going to add the r
there
so for me it's going to be lgbtqr
because I know there were a lot of
Republicans who probably watched lizzo
playing the flute James Madison flew it
and said to themselves
because of how you are I'm not a
republican by the way
so just so you know I'm not a republican
but I bet a lot of Republicans watch
that and they saw lizzo and they said to
themselves I do not want to have sex
with her
which would be sort of a minority weird
opinion
and so I think that any any time that
you have a like a non-standard sexual
opinion
that that kind of puts you into the
non-standard group now when I say
non-standard I'm not insulting because I
prefer non-standard people
that's why I love my lgbtq people
because anybody who's
just you know completely out and
non-standard love them
be as non-standard as you want as long
as it doesn't hurt me I mean I don't
want to be disadvantaged by it but be
yourself go wild go be as lgbtq as you
could possibly be I love it all
but I would like to add to it I like you
so much
I love it so much
that I think we should add Republicans
to it and probably in cells as well
because if in cells are not a distinct
sexual group I don't know who is
now some of you are going to say Scott
Scott Scott
you bigot you're gonna say that
some of you you're going to say the big
difference is being a republican is a
choice
whereas being gay is you know genetic
so you can't compare a choice
to genetic you know what I say to you if
you were to say that
I'd say you bigot
there is plenty of science to suggest
that whether you're conservative or
liberal is baked in it is in fact
genetically
at least influenced
I don't know to what extent
so yes it's very much genetically
influenced your political stuff and so
I would suggest that all of the things
that are genetically and I would say I
think the incels are in a situation
where their genetic situation probably
has a lot to do with their
you know their outcomes
so I think if if the if your genetics
are the primary driver of it and it puts
you into a sexual preference category
that's non-majority
then I think you belong on the lgbtq r i
trained and not with the regular people
who would obviously be attracted to Lisa
now
and when I and I want to be clear I'm
not saying that
most people in the world would want to
have sex with this
the largest group of Americans would
look at lizzo and say I want to get me
that it would be the smaller groups that
we you know individually that you'd lump
together in the lgbtq
ri category
now
um
if uh if you're fighting against these
special privileges that you think are
given to some categories but not you
then why you're not joining those
categories I don't know
you know we've speculated that the
teacher who has the wig and the gigantic
prosthetic breasts May in fact be
playing a prank and not actually
identifying as a woman
right we've all said that
if you worked if I worked in Corporate
America tomorrow like let's say I lost
everything you have to go get a real job
if I if I got a job in Corporate America
I would identify as black
and I would never change my mind
and I would make them have to deal with
that I would be my character Dave in in
my Dilbert comic except you know the
reverse of that
uh and I would never change my mind
because if you if you're not joining the
team that gets the advantages
why not
so I've got two teams Scott you can join
this team or this team I go what's the
difference well if you join this team
you get advantages
oh okay well why do people join the
other team
um
I don't know but they do well let me
understand I think I'm missing something
you got two teams one has disadvantages
and one has advantages you can join
either team there's no rule that says
you can't join the other team and yet
people will stay on the team with the
disadvantages
yes they will
because they identify with that team
to which I say
screw that I identify with the team
that's winning
I don't care who it is if you told me
tomorrow
that they
I don't know the radical gay Hispanics
had all the power in society
but there was nothing to stop you from
identifying as a radical gay Hispanic
I would be a I would identify as a
radical gay Hispanic in one minute
if there were no rules prevented
if society says here's the rules and you
and there's complete fluidity there's no
friction to move from one to the other
there is nothing that would keep me from
identifying as black in Corporate
America and if you think that's a joke
does anybody think I'm kidding
do you think that that's hyperbole
that's not hyperbole I would literally
physically
identify as black
in Corporate America
and I would never look back
and I I would say it with a straight
face to anybody who asked
and I would never ever back up back off
of that I would never back off
and in fact if you don't like your
situation because you feel like you're
being discriminated against and you
haven't joined the winning team
I can't explain that I honestly can't
like what what are you doing
what are you doing
why why in the world would you identify
as the group that gets less stuff
oh I'd like to I get identify with the
people who are who are going to be
discriminated against over early
no but it's not even maybe
is overtly
I mean seriously grow up join the
winning team there's nothing to stop you
and if you want all the nonsense to stop
that's how you do it
just all join the same team
because they can't discriminate against
you when you join their team
can they
you know this seems related but it's not
this is completely unrelated thought
have you ever noted that um
Democrat women
believe that Republican men
discriminate against women or have some
I don't know sexist beliefs about women
and that's probably true because
everybody has sexist beliefs men and
women
but have you ever noticed that when
there's a
um a powerful female Republican
candidate
that no Republican ever criticizes them
for being a woman
have you noticed that
I've never heard it once and I I'm like
immersed in
republicanly conservative conversation
never once have I heard anybody say
something like oh Kerry Lake uh we we
can't have her because what if she's on
her period
no one nobody like zero zero people uh
or how about uh we can't have Christie
gnome because of you know girls make bad
I don't what what the hell is somebody
gonna say I don't even know what anybody
says anymore like what is The Stereotype
that anybody would even use oh she'll be
late and
you know she'll she'll have to do her
makeup and she'll miss the meeting well
like what would anybody say right yeah
um and even Marjorie Taylor green you
know you can have your opinions about
her but there's no Republican
not once not once if I ever heard a
Republican
disparage a republican woman
not once
and I guess that's only useful if you
are a woman and you're wondering
I can tell you that when the men are
alone
they might say that one of them is hot
right Christina
they might say that actually usually
every time but they'll never say
anything bad you know they don't say
anything bad because she's a woman it
just doesn't happen
yeah and
it's hard to explain that isn't it
see this is this is why the Republicans
have a complete winning argument if they
just say we'll let the Republican women
take the abortion argument on for us
you don't understand how brilliant that
idea is do you because everybody wants
their opinion I get that you know men
want to have their opinion and there's
it's a free country you get to have your
opinion but if Republicans wanted to
just sweep the field if they just wanted
to sweep the field
the Republican man
should say in unison you know what why
would we think we could do better than
the Republican women
the only reason that a man should be
involved in the in the decision is
because you think that your man decision
improves the decision over what women
would have decided themselves
and that's sort of what you're thinking
maybe not expressly
but there's no argument for why men have
to be in this at all unless you believe
the women couldn't make the right
decision
is there anybody here who thinks that
women
couldn't make the right decision
anybody
if you believe that women can make the
right decision
and especially Republican women very
capable very you know very uh
fully powerful to take the argument
forward why would men do something that
hurts men and doesn't help women
when Republican men become the face of
the abortion argument which they are
which they are men are the face of the
abortion argument for the Republicans
when they do that they're hurting men
right that hurts men because we get all
this criticism for being men in the
wrong topic
I don't need that like I I get
criticized that I have nothing to do
with it I'm literally not in the
conversation and I still get criticized
because I'm a man so men men get out of
this so if the Republican men just said
you know
the one the one thing we're confident of
is that Republican women have have this
now
some of you just have a reflexive
problem
with men letting go of any any kind of
power I get that but understand and it
has nothing to do with the the child
support or the the money part of it for
the money part
for the money part men need to part be
part of that conversation for sure
right
and I can't tell from the comments
but while I don't think it's possible
for it to happen would you agree that if
Republican men said you know we have our
opinions you've heard our opinions but
now we're gonna we're gonna let the
Republican women
carry the ball
you don't think that would work
you don't think the Democrats would say
whoa
that actually looks pretty good why are
why aren't we doing that because the
Republican men are all over the
conversation aren't they
I'm sorry the Democrat man Democrat men
are definitely in this conversation if
the Republican men said why are you in
this conversation we're out you talk to
our women
I mean that sounds sexist talk to our
women it's not our women
talk to those women let's say talk to
the women
all right
that's what I think
um Jonathan hate
quit the social psychologists uh some
kind of academic Association because
they had a forced diversity statement
that you have to sign for your research
so you have to sign a statement that uh
describes how your research will will
help diversity
or whether or not it does
and and he just said I quit
now it's not like he quit his job or he
didn't quit his job and he's giving them
a year to you know reassess so he's not
immediately quitting but he's he's
announced that that's an untenable thing
to force him to and his his point is
that once you put the political into the
scientific
you're just getting something that
nobody wants and I think that's a good
point so he's not saying that he
disagrees with the politics of it it's
not even relevant
it's just why did you put your politics
in my science
and why did you put your politics and my
Sciences
that's a strong statement right so I'm
totally with him now how would you like
to have some fun
would you like to have some fun
uh
Amazon Studios came out with their
inclusion policy
so Amazon Studios makes content for
Amazon
and I want to read to you from there
it's very extensive
but imagine imagine that you're a
Creator and you're trying to get
something made at Amazon Studios
uh they've they've got some new
inclusivity rules
I'd like to read some of the rules and
they're very long
at least just a sample of them a lot of
rules I just picked out something so
this will just be like a taste right
now I'll just read it fast so you just
sort of get the flavor of it right
they said uh
uh most Productions have a multitude of
speaking roles from leads to smaller
rules roles where it doesn't compromise
the authenticity of the story so they're
they're acknowledging
that if the nature of the story is about
one kind of person
you know there's going to be mostly that
kind of person so they get that the
story might dominate but if you can do
it they say
um they have aspiration goals the
minimum is uh for 30 this is the ratio
they want unless the story requires a
certain mix the mix that they want to
see is 30 white men
30 percent of white women
and non-binary and non-non-binary people
20 men from underrepresented races and
ethnicities 20 percent of women and
non-binary people from underrepresented
races and ethnicities and where we can
have more people from underrepresented
racial ethnic groups will seek to do
that
um and we also aspire to cast at least
10 percent of our roles with people who
are lesbian gay bisexual and transgender
and non-binder et cetera and then 10
with people who self-identify as a
person with a disability
uh but you can have one person could be
you know could represent more than one
category
now do you think I'm done
I'm just getting started
I'm just starting
it goes on
um
let's see
what else uh
when the storylines or the top billing
characters involve underrepresented
communities and that would include women
underrepresented ethnic racial groups
sexual orientations blah blah
disabilities we aim to have a minimum of
30 percent of above the lion staff hires
I think in above the line staff means
directors writers producers and creators
okay
so you want thirty percent of them to be
in those categories
and this aspirational goal will increase
to 50 by 2024.
um I read the whole thing and I didn't
see anything about Republicans
so apparently Amazon Studio has no
uh their inclusion policy does not
include
uh
the
one of the dominant you know
philosophies of the country which is
republicanism
and
but it also doesn't include Democrat
specifically
so inclusivity is kind of interesting
here's what I think Republicans should
do they should buy into Dei the
diversity equality and inclusion and
they should demand that they be included
in it
so the problem with is that Republicans
are a minority in this country 30
percent
and they're treated uh quite
disgustingly
and I believe that they should demand
equal rights under Dei
and they should fight for it
no I'm not kidding
see so some of you think I'm joking
right no no I mean actually legally
physically
practically and for a good purpose
that it would actually be good for the
country not a prank
I'm not talking about a prank
I'm talking about something good for the
country that everybody who feels
discriminated against should have their
say
just as everybody with disabilities or
racial ethnic
of sexuality difference they should all
have their say every one of them
every one of them
but let's just be complete
see Embrace and amplify
if if embracing and amplifying a
position
uh strengthen this it then that was a
good thing
if embracing it completely destroys it
well it wasn't a good thing
if embracing it destroys it so let's
embrace it
let's say
you know if you can
well I guess I've made the point just
embrace it yeah I guess Christians would
be the same point
um
I saw a republican say
that uh he was against uh gay marriage
there's a republican candidate for State
office in Arizona who says on Twitter
the he was opposed to gay marriage
because he thinks it opened up
you know opened up a path to these other
things that he doesn't like
and I wonder this is there anybody who
thinks that they lost something because
gay marriage is legal
like what did you lose
now before something happens it's
perfectly reasonable to worry that
something could go wrong
change you know change is always
it changes always uh difficult but does
anybody feel they lost something
somebody's told me to f off I think
laughs
you lost interest you lost God's respect
did you
the concept of marriage but didn't
affect your marriage
did your marriage get worse
because gays got married
yeah now it seems to me that
um this should be one of those cases
where I think Republicans could say give
me a fact check on this because I you
know most of you may have had a
different opinion than I did from the
start
so I've always been in favor of
everybody doing whatever they want if it
doesn't hurt me
so you know I'm happy with everything
but would you say that maybe it was
something you worried about but then it
happened and you found out it didn't
bother you at all
is there anybody here who would say they
were opposed to gay marriage but now
that they can see it the gay marriage
itself no no slippery slope stuff that
that's not fair you you cannot say that
gays can't have equal rights or you know
that would be the argument you can't say
the gays don't get what they get because
somebody else might slippery slope later
that's not fair
you you have to look at gay marriage by
itself
yes or no you can't throw in other
things that might happen that's not fair
I don't know interesting I just wondered
if anybody uh checks their thinking and
says well I guess I could be wrong
sometimes
no
because that's how case law works oh I
understand that no I understand that
it's a real thing
I'm just saying that you can't treat
rights like that because rights rights
are not
you don't you know what I mean right
that would be like saying well you know
I will end slavery but we have this good
argument for why maybe we should keep a
little bit I mean no no no there's some
things that just have to be absolutes
all right
absolutely
is there anything that I forgot to
mention
let's talk about Putin
um
I don't believe that uh nuclear war is
likely
and I think it's very unlikely here's
why
everybody who says that Putin doesn't
have a
um an exit ramp
I don't know what they're talking about
because his AXA ramp is just right in
front of you it's obvious
Putin's exit ramp as he says I succeeded
in denotsifying these areas because he
said that was what he was there to do
and then what's Ukraine going to say is
Ukraine going to say no you failed we
still have plenty of Nazis
so it's one of those claims that they
could make and the other side is going
to be like whatever like they're not
going to even debate it whatever so he's
going to say I got rid of all the Nazis
and then he's going to say and then we
held these referendums
and then these people got what they
wanted which was to be part of Russia
now I don't know the actual percentages
that would have happened let's say let's
say you had pulled those people
um fairly instead of this obviously it
was a ringed election but I suppose
you'd ask them fairly
would the people in Crimea have actually
voted by majority maybe just 55 percent
or something but would Crimea have said
we'd like to be part of Russia
does anybody even know the answer to
that
and would all four of those areas
because I've got a feeling that if you
could find at least one of those areas
of the four
if you could find one of them where an
honest pull of the public would find
that they would rather be Ukrainian
there's your exit you just say hey hey
let's would you agree Putin that we will
re-re-poll the the people because he had
that fake fake vote we'll we'll repo the
people and we'll actually go with the
majority and if if three out of the four
areas say they want to be Russian
you got it and if one of the four says
we'd rather be Ukrainian
then that's your deal you get to say you
won you got to keep these Russian
speaking places that seem they want to
be Russian there was one that was
contended that's why there's a little
pain both ways you know Russia gets a
little pain they give something back
Ukraine gets a little pain they give
give away three regions that wanted
wanted to be Russian in a hypothetical
and then
Russia claims success NATO claims
success because they you know they were
a Bork
how is how is that not obvious
I mean to me to me the EXO ramp is right
there now here's why I don't think uh
now I'm not saying it would be easy or
that you know people are just gonna take
that path and go what I'm saying is that
you're never going to get to nuclear war
until that thing has been completely
talked about and it hasn't yet
so there there's a whole phase that you
would have to go through before you'd
even start thinking about nuclear war
and that phase is let's talk about these
four regions
and let's talk about making the deal
about the four regions now of course
zelenski says No Deal
and Putin says no deal no way right
and so the people who are not good at
negotiating look at it and say well I
guess there's no deal
so I guess it's going to be nuclear war
but everybody should know at this point
that both of them are supposed to take
the extreme that's your opening position
your opening position is the extreme so
if you have to give up anything it looks
like an actual sacrifice
so that all they're doing is making sure
that if they give something up it
actually feels like pain
because if they don't both feel like
pain
then there's no deal
they have to both paint themselves in a
corner
that they can only get out of at Great
pain
that's how you get to a peace deal and
they've done that they both painted
themselves in a corner there is a way
out it requires both of them to take a
little pain but it's it's right there
I mean you don't have to be a rocket
science to know what it looks like it
looks like some of the territory goes
back to Ukraine
and sometimes security guarantees and
economic guarantee using blah blah blah
so it's one thing to say that those that
any negotiations would be successful all
I'm saying is that I'm not even going to
think about nuclear war
I'm not even going to say moral
equivalency
what kind of idiot are you
I I have a chapter in my in one of my
books about the moral equivalency idiots
you never have the people who come in
and they think they're making the smart
comment well you're making a moral
equivalency between two things and you
never are
and he knows you never are you're just
talking about things
all right there's this thing and there's
this thing this might cause this thing
and this is a variable and then some
 idiot comes in and goes well
you're making a moral equivalency
between Satan and ice cream
there's no moral equivalency between
Satan and ice cream
and I'll be like
I didn't say there was but why are you
even imagining that I would say that
yeah in fact I can't even think of
somebody who would be less likely to
make a moral equivalence
probably the least likely person to do
that
uh Ukraine's always been a vassal State
why treat them anyway differently that's
not a
that's not thinking
they've always been a vassal state so
why not treat them that way like you're
missing all the logic and the reasons
and the facts and all that stuff
how do you handle a constant
misunderstanding
you know it's the most annoying part of
my life
is that
close to 98 of everything that people
criticized me about never happened
do most of you know that you know some
of you are here just to be my critics
but you do know that 98 of all the
criticism about me literally never
happened
you know like you know like I'm a
holocaust denier nope
or or that I think uh rape is natural
and therefore it's okay uh no
just crazy the the strangest one is
that I was Pro mask literally I
organized a boycott against masks
I literally was trying to organize a
national boycott against mass and so
people think oh he's so Pro mask
like most of it's not even close
to my opinion
um
the part of Ukraine the Putin holds
makes up 80 percent of their GDP
yeah are you talking about Crimea
specifically
I mean Crimea is a big part of it
because that's not going anywhere is it
um you defended masks I will never
you
 you all right I'm just gonna get
rid of you you defended masks never
happened
all right
uh milk Chaser you I don't care
that you're on the subscription service
you should just leave here really you're
not welcome
defended masks you I mean seriously
 you like I'm actually
I'm actually angry at you this is not a
joke
 you
right
seriously you
and and I don't want to see you again
you should leave the leave locals you
should leave
all right just get off
right because because that's not
productive
you know you know very well
that I talked about the science of them
but I never promoted them as something
you should wear now once did I say I
wanted to wear a mask you know that
you know that
so I don't want your money off all
right
I suppose that's not the best way to end
this live stream
foreign
y
is it
wait a minute
is today Friday
today's Friday
I had no idea I thought it was Thursday
all right well thanks for that one more
sip
simultaneity
and we shall go
all right everybody ready for the
closing zip
go
would you like a good news prediction
this time next year
Ukraine war will be over
okay
inflation will have topped and will be
heading down
the supply chain will be better
the energy situation will be way better
especially because of the Ukraine war
ning down
we will be heading into a golden age
like you have never seen before
because our biggest problems look like
they're winding down the pandemic is
winding down the Ukraine war is winding
down China seems to be on the ropes we
seem to be bringing our stuff home and I
think that even nuclear is likely to
start to look good by the way plume
Theory probably was not
I'm thinking that plume theory was a bad
scientific hypothesis
but that's another discussion
um
now I'm not predicting I'm not
predicting a second term for Biden
uh
I don't have a prediction about that yet
all right but in my opinion everything
everything looks good and I think in
order to get there
the the winter is going to be rugged
so I am going to predict that the winter
will be tough
but here's what's going to happen
because we have to pull together
and Europe especially
people are going to be just like moving
in with other people's homes people are
going to be checking on Grandma
there will be more people helping out
people
than any time since maybe World War II
so you're going to find more cohesion
just because we have to you know we have
a common enemy now which is lack of
energy
so our
um no Thomas
just off with that okay
and you too
it just just off with that
all right so I think everything's going
to be uh great next year you got a tough
winter but we will pull together to get
through it and then everything's going
to be awesome all right
bye for now
we'll see you YouTube
