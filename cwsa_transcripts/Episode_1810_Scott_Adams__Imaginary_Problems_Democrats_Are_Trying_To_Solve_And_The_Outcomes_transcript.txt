me now for the unparalleled pleasure go
yes i did just tweet
is nbc
the rt for america
because i feel like maybe it is
you know rt is russia today
it's a publication
that the russian government tries to
pretend as a you know like a cnn
competitor or something but you know all
the stories are biased
uh the way putin would want them
but nbc just looks like our version of
it doesn't it it just looks like they
say whatever the government is
that they want you to believe
yeah i guess i guess in a way it is a
cnn competitor you're right
all right you also the story of aoc
getting arrested for protesting about
the abortion decisions
in the supreme court and
people are laughing because it looks
like she was holding her her hands
behind her
her back like she was uh
being handcuffed
but she was not being handcuffed she was
just being led away she was waving at
one point
now i don't know if she put her hands
behind her back to make the photo up
look more impressive or maybe she was
just offering herself her hands to the
police
right if you knew you were going to get
arrested it was part of your
plan would you if the police came up
wouldn't you put your hands behind you
and say cuff me
basically telling them you know i'm on
board just cuff me and take me make it
easy i don't know i don't know what she
was doing but it's not much of a story
kind of fun
um here's one of the biggest stories in
the world that you will think is not
i don't think i can convince you this is
one of the biggest things happening like
really big
they're really a signal of the golden
age
uh
there's a tweet today i guess a cedar
sinai doctor dr amanda velasquez is
making the following claim
which i believe
is gigantic
you will say no that doesn't seem to
make much difference let's see who's
right
her claim is this that obesity
is not a disease of willpower
the doctor says that over 40 of the
nation is affected and
and uh not because they're not motivated
enough
or that they lack willpower
but because it's truly a disease
now that
is the primary message in the book just
over my
shoulder
written
some years ago
in which i described to the public
that if you're trying to lose weight
using this thing called willpower you're
probably going to fail
because willpower isn't even real
it's sort of like going hunting with an
imaginary gun
if you're going to use your willpower
to lose weight you're not going to lose
any weight
because you're not using anything
there's no such thing as willpower
it doesn't exist
there's simply choices between things
sometimes one is better sometimes the
other is better but you're always going
to take the best choice
that's it
so the only thing you can do is make
sure that the right choice looks good
compared to the bad choice
that's all you can do
there's the willpower is imaginary you
always take the thing that looks the
best to you that's it
now there is addiction and i think that
food is properly considered an addiction
because it's designed that way
it's designed to addict
you know the if you manipulate the salt
sugar fat content
you can actually scientifically hit an
addiction level there's a book by that
name that teaches you how that was done
and it was probably about the time that
america just his health just fell apart
with obesity because once the food
manufacturers learned how to make
addictive food
they no longer needed to make nutritious
food
see the problem
why would you make nutritious food when
you could make addictive new food
one of them makes you rich and the other
one
nobody buys
because they're not addicted to it
um
not nobody but you know what i mean
so what i see that the medical community
can say out loud that will power isn't
going to help you lose weight
they're very close
to understanding that it also doesn't
exist
the reason will power won't let you lose
weight
medical community just push it a little
bit further you're almost there
there right now they're saying well
we will power you really you should look
over here no that's that's all that's so
close
you should say willpower does not exist
forget it
just find a way to make your good
choices look better than your bad
choices that's what my book teaches
for example
if you have in your house
tasty food that's bad for you sitting
right next to perfectly healthy food
that doesn't taste so good
what the hell are you gonna do
if your house has good food and
unhealthy food sitting right next to it
it's not about willpower
it's about you picked the one that was
tastier that's it that's the whole thing
so get rid of that good get rid of that
food from your house
why do you have food in your house
that's unhealthy
you should go to your house and say well
i'm really hungry i have a choice
between these two healthy things yeah i
feel like i like this healthy thing
better than this healthy thing
done
as soon as you think that willpower is
part of the process you're lost
you might as well just call yourself fat
and go die
because there's nothing you could do if
that's your freight
all right but uh seeing the medical
community wake up to the illusion is
kind of interesting and i've said that
the golden age will be
characterized by people losing their
illusions
losing their illusions that's that's the
theme today
as people start to lose their illusions
they can be more effective
once you lose the illusion of willpower
let me let me make my case
a number of you have read my book and
lost
lost lots of weight
i hear people losing 80 pounds like
regularly 80 pounds
like that's a that's a typical thing i
hear every day every day
and all they did was forget about
willpower and just manage their choice
options that's all they did
all right
to make my case i'm just going to ask
the people who read the book and tried
the method of
you know not using willpower how many of
you lost weight using the method
so in the comments over in the locals so
the locals maybe you won't see it i'll
tell you what's happening over there
i was down 60 at one point definitely
yes it helped lost 20 pounds so far down
40.
i was 75 pounds down
30 pounds
i'm just reading the people who read the
book right 70 pounds 40 pounds 12 pounds
this is not small stuff
this is enormous
look at all the people lost weight i
mean
somebody got divorced and lost 140
pounds of ugly fat and that that's quite
an accomplishment
um
60 years and 140 pounds
uh all right
amazing all right
so uh medical science is catching up to
cartoonists and that's not even a joke
like that's actually literally true
medical science is just sort of halfway
to catching up to
cartoonists writes a book
and that's true
right that's not an overclaim
because i do have experience as a
hypnotist
and hypnotists know that willpower isn't
real
it's just the medical community hasn't
figured it out yet
all right um here's a story that uh
this is what i call the wink from the
simulation
a wink from the simulation this is how
you know that you live in a constructed
reality that has some jokes built into
it
right
so this story is apparently real
some canine units
found a bunch of money that had been
stolen from the cadillac lounge in
providence now i believe that's a strip
club
it's a
fact check man that's a strip club right
and i think all the money they found was
in uh singles which is funny
but that's not the funny part of the
story it's not funny that it's a strip
club it's not funny that they got robbed
it's not funny that k9 units found the
money and it was mostly in one dollar
bills what's funny is then that the
owner of the cadillac lounge
his first name is dick his last name is
shapi
s-h-a-p-p-y
and if you said it quickly
he's been making dick choppy for a long
time
yeah have another drink
if this drink and this naked woman
doesn't make some dick sharpie i don't
know what well
yeah i speak i'm making a lot of dick
shopping right now for uh
oh
this is just a gift from the simulation
and we should just enjoy it
just enjoy it
okay
uh there's some fake news on fox news um
courtesy of tom cotton interview so tom
cotton
says democrats think americans who are
struggling with 4.50 gas can afford a
sixty five thousand dollar electric car
good point or bad point
go ahead good point or bad point
do you do you think it's uh do you think
democrats are
kind of on their own planet
because they think that people who can't
afford gas could buy a 65
000 car good point or bad point
well as democrats were quick to point
out in their criticism here are some
costs for electric cars now the 65 000
might be referring to more of a
tesla situation
but here are existing electric cars that
the democrats say you can buy
and remember that
we're comparing this to the tom cotton
um
quote with 65 000
chevy bolt
all round up just round up 27 000.
nissan leaf 29 000 mini cooper 31 000
mazda mx 35 000
honda kona electric
35 000
so is
is uh tom cotton correct
that electric cars don't seem to be the
right answer because they're so
expensive or is he incorrect
that really he doubled the price of
these and if you looked at a you know an
ordinary car
that it would be somewhat affordable
now i would argue that if you're buying
a car in that thirty thousand dollar
range that would be average
let me confess in public
i don't know what average is anymore
i've been i've been rich for too long
sorry
it's just it's sort of a sort of a blind
spot i have now but but intentionally
don't ask me what a quarter of milk
costs because i haven't looked at a i
haven't looked at a price at a grocery
store in 25 years
um
it's sort of the first luxury you buy
by the way if anybody's ever had the
experience of going from
poor to not poor
and and you're you know you you started
thinking what luxuries can i get if i
have money the first drug the first
luxury
by far
is not looking at prices
of you know just ordinary things in the
store if i go buy light bulbs
i don't look at the price
that is my luxury
it is amazing it's amazing
if you didn't think getting rich is a
good deal
probably most of you thought it was a
good deal
but
it's weird that the best part of it is
something you don't think of
like you think oh i'm gonna get my yacht
and my nice car and my nice home and
those are great
those are great things
but not thinking about the price of
stuff for ordinary everyday stuff
is just an amazing like mental
mental vacation it's amazing
so anyway a little digression there
sorry about that
i don't know i i think i'm going to call
this fake news
i'm going to call this fake news would
anybody disagree with that
characterization
because if you really can buy electric
car for 30 something thousand
i think it's fake news
right
and by the way i i wasn't really aware
of this
because i don't follow electric car
prices i didn't really know
now if you're calling a hyperbole
you know i'll accept that
and let me say again that i think tom
cotton is
one of the strongest candidates for
president
you know if trump doesn't run and
there's another republican i'd probably
look at him the hardest
but um i would love to see him
get a little bit closer to the
factual reality it would make me feel a
little more comfortable he's got plenty
of material i mean how hard is it to
argue against democratic leadership
it's not hard
yeah you don't have to pick something
that could be fact-checked
and one of the things i've liked about
tom cotton the most so far
is as far as i knew
he hadn't said anything that was just
you know obvious
i haven't seen it
but you know and and again you said this
is hyperbole and i'm going to accept
that if trump said that this i would
have called it hyperbole
right
but i don't think tom cotton is really
the hyperbole guy i don't know if that's
his i don't know if that's his best look
um anyway
democrats continue to solve
imaginary
problems and
it's starting to be a pattern that's
hard to miss
right
i'm going to mention a few and see if
the pattern starts to take form in your
head
so here are some problems that the
democrats have decided to solve uh so
they they passed in just the house
their uh respect for marriage act which
would codify into law
that it will there will be legal for
interracial marriages to continue
and for gay marriages to continue to be
legal
now
let me ask you this let's just deal with
interracial marriage first
i have been alive for 65 years
i have lived in some
very republican places
i have dealt extensively
with people all over the political
you know landscape from the farthest of
the right to the farthest of the left
and i talk a lot about politics and
issues and stuff in my 65 years i have
not met one person
not one
who is opposed to interracial marriage
have you
have you ever met even one person who
was opposed to interracial marriage
look at all the answers go by and a lot
of my a lot of my followers are you know
retirement age et cetera and even they
haven't heard of it
do you think it has something to do with
the fact let's talk about republicans
here so we'll just talk about
republicans do you think it has
something to do with the fact that
justice
thomas
and mitch mcconnell are in interracial
marriages
come on
like two of the most important
republican figures are proudly in
interracial marriages does anybody care
does anybody care
i've never seen it
i've never seen it in my whole life i've
never seen one peep
and we live in a world where people
complain about everything
we complain about
everything
but not one person in 65 years has ever
said to me you know
i got a real problem with this
interracial marriage stuff never not
once
now you did hear
people say oh maybe you don't want to
get into that situation
because it will make your life harder
that was an opinion you used to hear
but nobody said nobody said there's
something like morally ethically wrong
with it i never that
so that was that's an imaginary problem
that the democrats have sold
uh how about the their other big project
is trying to prevent another
insurrection
like january 6. they're trying to
prevent another january 6 insurrection
that's right
one of their top priorities is to
prevent
something that didn't happen
from happening again
i'm not making that up there definitely
was no insurrection no no unarmed
insurrection that didn't happen
so all of their work they would say is
not even so much about what happened
it's more about making sure it doesn't
happen again
literally
their top priority is to make sure that
a thing that never happened and really
almost couldn't happen
won't happen a second time
i'm not making that up that's a purely
imaginary problem
how about uh all the effort they spent
looking into the russia collusion
hoax
100 not real
and it was their top priority for years
completely not real
absolutely made up and they made it up
it wasn't like they got fooled by it
they made it up
imaginary
um
how about uh
i don't know about this but according to
msnbc
an article there
um
they believe that the iran problem in
terms of nuclear
was solved
that obama solved it and that iran was
totally out of the nuclear arms making
business
and that here's the weird part
msnbc
is saying without embarrassment
that the iran situation was solved
but israel was not aware of it
that's a category i'd like to create i'd
like to create
things you would have to believe in
order to also believe the dominant
democrat narrative
so in this case the thing you would have
to believe to buy into their narrative
that that iran was a solved problem
you'd have to believe that
israel that the country of israel
was not aware
that the problem had been solved
their single biggest
risk of extermination really literally
if there was a nuke nuke dropped on
israel it'd be game over
their number one i would guess their
number one
biggest issue in the world for which
they have embedded spies they're
watching everything there's nothing that
could be more
of more interest than israel is that was
that a fair statement
because normally that would sound like
hyperbole right but i feel like i could
say that iran is the number one biggest
problem for the
israeli government right
i mean they got tons of other problems
but that's got to be number one
so in order to follow the msnbc and
democrat narrative you would have to
believe
that the entire government of israel
was unaware that the number one biggest
problem in their reality had already
been solved
not only had it already been solved but
according to the democrat narrative they
unsolved it
with trump
they took a solved problem and netanyahu
the biggest hawk
decided to unsolve it and create again a
nuclear problem that's actually what
msnbc is trying to sell you
isn't that just like don't you just
shake your head and say
how does anybody believe this
and the answer is
their consumers do
otherwise they wouldn't be in business
there are enough people who believe this
that they can get away with it
it's completely made up
the
the democrats are working almost
entirely on marriage imaginary problems
can you think of a better signal that
we're entering the golden age
i can't
i can't think of a better signal that
we're entering a golden age
than the fact that our government is
forced
to work on imaginary problems
because if they don't work on the
imaginary ones they don't have enough to
do they don't have something to argue
about they literally have to create
imaginary problems because civilization
has reached the point
where we fixed the real ones
it's true
how about our energy problem what caused
our energy problem
fake news
it's a manufactured problem
if the fake news had not convinced us
you know to get rid of oliver or or
convince us to let's see
uh first of all the fake news convinced
us that germany was not at risk from
russian uh oil
actions right
tell me if i'm wrong did the fake news
not tell you
that uh when trump says that germany is
at risk
he should be laughed at that that's what
the fake news told you fake news said no
just laugh at that guy
and he was right now that's a problem
that was caused by the fake news
if you think that the problem was caused
by
bad management or
no the management follows the news
the news is the tailwag of the dog if
the news says something's a bad idea
if cnn says something's a bad idea are
the democrats going to do it
no
no they can't if cnn says it's a bad
idea democrats can't do it
they can't so it's not
the democrats don't have any control
cnn does now it might be that the
democrats are controlling cnn
that connection you know certainly seems
likely
but if you're looking for the root cause
the one that one thing you could fix
that would fix everything it's going to
be the fake news
so i think the fake news is behind our
energy problems because you know climate
panic etc
um let's see what else the fake news is
causing i made a list here
um well actually let's let's do this
let's talk about things that are
trending well and then not trending well
all right
so here are some things uh that are
trending positive at the moment
just to give you a little hint of
optimism okay
here are things that are going well i'm
in california and by now my state is
usually on fire
like actually by now this time of the
season
last few years i couldn't go outdoors
couldn't go outdoors
because there was so much wildfire smoke
everywhere in california
this year
it's fine
apparently those are rapid response
helicopters or
some other mitigation or is it luck i
don't know yeah so far so far right
could change but it looks like
california actually got on top of it
and and if uh if newsom had anything to
do with that i don't know if he did
but i would give him credit
if he did yeah it might be the chinooks
you're right so they've got rapid
response helicopters that maybe that
makes a difference i believe energy
costs have topped out
am i right
it looks like gas topped out maybe it's
sort of drifting low it's the top you
worry about
if you hit the top and start drifting in
the other direction you're fine you just
have to worry about new tops if you
don't have any new tops you're fine
so energy i think is trending in the
right direction finally we are
decoupling from china that trend is
looking good maybe too slow
maybe too fast i don't know but the
trend is right
we've got nuclear energy is now back in
uh let's say back in good favor that's
amazingly good trend for everything
especially climate change if you're
worried about that
the supply chain issues have topped out
have they not
there are fewer ships waiting to be
unloaded
and people have figured out enough
workarounds at this point
that the the supply chain problem's not
over by any means but i think it topped
out
which means it's going to drift back in
the right direction
how about
the ukraine situation
well in terms of spending it's out of
control but in terms of it likely to go
nuclear i'd say not really any chance of
that
so i would say that the risk of nuclear
war from ukraine is now trending not
really
you might disagree with that but i think
i think that risk is sort of mitigated
at this point
because russia will get enough out of it
that they don't need to do anything
crazy i think the pandemic as annoying
as it is is largely managed
we're largely past the pandemic you know
with all the
you know problems that still linger but
largely we've
pushed it into endemic
territory let's try to keep it there
um
stocks are up
i don't know about today the last few
days
let's see what the stocks are doing
stocks
you've probably already told me in the
comments before i could do it
the s p is up
s p is up
but you know i think there's a 15-minute
delay so maybe it's not really up but i
think stocks have been good last few
days jobs are still good that's a lot of
stuff that's good
that yeah the stocks are in the toilet
we're all talking trend
right the trend looks like the stocks
have stopped falling
would you would you at least agree that
they've stopped falling
because i believe that the fed is
starting to you know
make the right moves and tightening up
and we're not spraying money like we
used to except for ukraine
bitcoin's up two percent uh i'm not
about i don't know about that one all
right so here's some things that are not
trending right
all right not trending right
uh
let's see the fake news is getting worse
ukraine spending
it looks like a permanent sinkhole and
military industrial complex owns us
so everything about the ukraine
situation is still negative in terms of
spending
uh
inflation and government debt
if energy costs are coming down maybe
inflation hit a top but i'm not going to
call a top on inflation yet are you
still with me on that
would anybody call a top on inflation
already
i feel it's like just early for that
i see one yes lots of no's nose
so we're not going to call the top on
inflation yet right but do you think
we're close
i feel like we're in a within a point or
two
yeah i think we're within a point
something like that
i think we're approaching a top
but we're definitely not out of control
you know we're we're not going to
zimbabwe i think you can rule out
zimbabwe zimbabwe like inflation
it looks like we're going to you know we
might we're going to double digit and
then pull back i think that's what's
going to happen
you'll be fine and jobs are weirdly
good
jobs are good
yeah i keep telling you as long as the
jobs look good
you end up powering through anything
it's only when you lose your jobs that
you can't power through it
ken kent says scott should read a book
on how to gain muscle
um i feel like
i'm not sure where that comment came
from
but
you realize i'm i'm literally a senior
citizen right
don't make me take my shirt off
because you know i will
that's such a weird comment i should
read a book on how to build muscle
you're not wrong but it's a weird
comment
all right here's another uh
all right here's a challenge for you
name a problem that isn't
caused by the fake news a political
problem
name a major political like headline
kind of problem that's not caused by the
fake news
somebody says inflation
do you think
inflation would be what it is if the
news if the news talked about the
economy accurately
would inflation be what it is
in other words would we make the same
decisions we've made in the past
if the news
told people what would happen if you
spend this money you'll get this
inflation
i don't think so i don't think we would
make the same decisions so that's the
problem of fake news
hunter biden hunter biden is a problem
of fake news because the fake news is
preventing us from
you know dealing with hunter biden's
situation
war do you think the war in ukraine is
caused by
real news or fake news
here here's why america supports the war
in ukraine
because americans have been convinced
that putin is the aggressor
that's fake news
putin is not the aggressor in ukraine
america is
america is totally the aggressor
did you know that
[Laughter]
now some of you know it like because
you're you're more news you know uh
saturated you're you're more likely to
look the people who watch this live
stream are a little bit more likely to
have more context
but i don't think most of the public
knows that we're the aggressor in that
war
putin literally is acting defensively
now he's acting defensively in a way
that's you know helps his self-interest
and conquers territory and all that but
ukraine used to be his
in effect it used to be his we stole it
if you didn't know that we took it
ukraine
from russia that you don't understand
why they're trying to take it back
the whole thing is based on fake news
right all right how about another one
give me give me any story that's not
based on fake news
anything
that's a headline story
national debt
right
national debt
like i said national debt and inflation
is the same story if the news explained
economics to us in the simplest way and
it didn't lie
the public would have put a control on
the government and said oh okay that's
too far you know pull it back a little
deeply uninformed that's because the
fake news
high school
yeah how about epidemic racism
if the if the fake news were real news
they would say yes there is systemic
racism
fox news would say the same thing if the
news were real
fox news would say oh there's definitely
systemic racism
but they don't they say it doesn't exist
but if they did
do you know what would be the next level
what do you do about it
if the fake news allowed us all to say
okay it exists
now what do you do about it
the next stage would be oh fix the
schools
now why doesn't the news tell you what
to do about fixing schools
because the answer is the teachers
unions is the problem and that's a
that's a democrat-based situation so the
fake news has to tell you that the real
problem is republicans or something
because the real problem is democrats
and specifically
the democrat connection to the teachers
unions the teaching unions unions are so
big
that they can donate enough money to
control the democrat party
so that the teachers union does what it
needs to do for its own people get get
the most
job security and
safety and income that they can
that part makes sense
except that the victims are the children
if the teachers unions do a really good
job and they do
a really good job the unions do a really
good job
it will destroy the lives of the
children
and the unions did a really good job and
it's destroying the lives of the
children and creating
systemic racism because you have a whole
another yet another generation of young
black americans who are underserved
again
it's not like we don't know how to fix
it
bad schools
fix them
no teachers union has too much power you
can't do that
but we're getting closer
however here's your golden age indicator
uh there is a an attorney
his last name is crump
and he's fairly famous because he's he's
a representative families in various
police cases
connected to black lives matter so uh mr
crump
is a well-known as a black lives matter
supporter type uh he did he represented
families of trayvon martin
michael brown brianna taylor i mean this
is the most famous names in this space
right
jacob blake and george floyd among
others among others
and so so you know who he is right
all right so
i think this matters give me give me
give me a check on this i'm going to
tell you his race
i think it matters to the story
but
maybe you shouldn't i'm checking myself
right now
does it matter to the story all right
tell me if i'm a racist for mentioning
this he's black
i think it adds to the story
but i might be just throwing something
in there that doesn't matter you've been
that you decide here's the story so now
you know who he is
here's what he's doing
there are some parents who are suing the
baltimore school district for taking
their money
in taxes
and providing no benefit to the
community in other words the lawsuit
says the school
system is so broken is literally a zero
doesn't do anything for the community so
you're taking your money you're
providing zero in return and we're suing
you
and mr crump
the person who
is identified for
you know supporting black lives matter
and
all things of that nature
has joined the lawsuit
he joined the lawsuit
this is so there's a big supporter of
black lives matter in the black
community and he just said
yeah you know you're right it's the
school
it's a little story
that might be a big story
or like a indication of a turning point
if you could get people at the quality
level of this mr crump
if black leaders at this level i mean
he's highest level capability right if
people at that level can correctly
identify the problem
we're in good shape
the problem is that they're looking in
the wrong place
and they just turned and said wait a
minute
maybe the problem is right here
we can all get on the same page if
that's the problem because the
republicans are you know locked and
loaded
and ready to do something about schools
if you saw the the statistics for the
baltimore school district it's almost as
if there's no school
that's how bad the performance is
it's very close
to not actually having a school district
it's that close i mean you think that's
an exaggeration
but so many of the people have a grade
point average under
one
under
one
that's basically completely broken
now
you need somebody who's got this kind of
credentials that krump has where you
know
where side he's on
you know what side he's on right there's
no doubt about what side he's on
and i'm on his side
so i'm on his side
so mr crump i join you in this
full
completely right
and
if you can use your lawyerly skill and
power to
to you know just break this thing
so we can fix it
i'm totally on board so
go get it done mr crump
good for you
all right
and that
i believe
i believe
brings us to the conclusion of
the best live stream in the history of
live streams
now let me ask you this question have i
made my case
or are you beginning to believe
that there is a turning point that's
happening right now
it's hard to recognize because
things are so bad
but you know it's like darkest before
the dawn situation
but there are a lot of big big things
that just turned
and i would argue that even some of the
things you think are continuing big
problems
maybe they're not
maybe they're not
the one i like to point to is illegal
immigration
completely out of control right
but coincidentally it lines up when we
have the greatest need for labor
i don't know
maybe it's a self-fixing problem
need more labor
illegal immigration is out of control um
now i'm not going to say that they match
up right because a lot of the labor we
need is skilled labor and that's not
what we're talking about
but i do think it's going to free up
other people to maybe
learn some skilled labor
um
yeah and let me be clear i'm not in
favor of any illegal immigration
to me the correct amount is zero
but we should have a system that
recognizes that when the economy needs
more
we open it up when it needs less
you tighten it up
that's easy
it was easy to know what to do it's hard
to get there
your food bill disagrees i don't know
what that means
labor participation rate is 62 percent
well that's voluntary
uh we do need foreign labor if the
people here don't want to work for
whatever reason
yeah
have you ever
i had this experience the other day i
was in the
park
there were a lot of people there for an
event
and i looked around and i asked myself
what percentage of all the people in
this park
work
have you ever done that
if you work for a living like you've
always worked i've worked since
i don't know i think i've worked
consistently since i was 10 or 11 years
old or something i don't think i ever
not i i don't think i ever didn't have a
job from about 12 years old
and so i only know working i don't know
anything else
and i stand in the park and i look
around and i think
yeah half of these people don't work
so you got your seniors your stay at
homes you're between jobs your kids your
students
although i'll call students working
in a way
college students i'll say are working
somebody on local says i only agree with
you 58.8 of the time but you come back
for the optimism i think i'm the only
one who does optimism am i wrong about
the world
can you name anybody else who does
a live stream
in which they in which they even point
out anything is going right
i think i'm the only one
and it's really tempting to talk about
the things that are going wrong because
those are the headlines but it's easy to
forget that i think we turned
i'm going to call the turn
so i know i haven't convinced you
but i'm going to call it
we're in the turn
we're entering a golden age
of medical miracles
we're going to mars
then the nuclear energy business is
unstoppable at this point including the
generation 4 that will be the safest yet
ukraine's the only thing i'm worried
about and that's just because the
military industrial complex has just you
know stuck a
stuck a needle in us and is bleeding us
as usual there's got to be some way to
fix that but if we get the ukraine
spending part under control
i feel like we're
we're in for a run let me tell you this
i do not give
i don't give advice for investing
so if you were to invest based on what
i'm going to say next
don't blame me
because i'm not recommending anything
however
i would feel sorry for anybody who
doesn't own stock at the moment in the
united states
if you don't own stock in the united
states
as of today
i feel like you're gonna you're gonna
feel bad about that at some point
now don't buy stock because i said so
it's just a prediction it's not not a
recommendation
has my opinion on bill gates changed
because of all the farmland
can somebody explain why bill gates
buying farmland is bad for anything
please
okay is there something about that story
i don't understand
because i can't think of anyone i would
rather own farmland
than bill gates
maybe elon musk
maybe jeff bezos
if you told me who do you want to own
all your farmland i would say one of our
billionaires
but one of the good ones
right
now i consider bill gates one of the
good ones not for his personal life
that's his business i don't care about
it
right don't care about his personal life
i also don't care about everything he
did before he turned to full
philanthropy
i also don't care that you think he was
wrong about
the pandemic right that's not the
category the the thing that i believe
is really obvious
is that he's not in it for the money
to me that is so blindingly obvious that
i can't even consider the other opinions
how many of you think bill gates is
still
still
as of right now in it for the money
what do you think
do you think he's in it for the money
power
no bill gates could have been president
he doesn't want power
he could he could easily have been
president if he wanted to
he could have bought it so he could have
bought his way in now he doesn't seem to
be power
recognition
maybe in the sense that being known as
the best philanthropist would be kind of
cool
yeah
but i don't you know he make eugenics
i think the
here's the other least likely thing that
that bill gates is
like a secret eugenicist
population control
um
population control is just people
controlling their own destiny
do you have a problem with
bill gates thinking that people should
control their own destiny
and how much population or how many
babies they have
i mean i'm not sure that that's evil
giving people power
let me tell you if bill gates buys up
all by the way can somebody nobody ever
completed the thought
what would go wrong
if bill gates owns the most farmland in
the united states what and then and then
what what goes wrong
how does that turn bad for us
because if if you ask me the most likely
person to figure out how to grow crops
without you know traditional fertilizer
and irrigation would be bill gates
can you imagine anybody more likely
to find a way to use the farmland in the
most productive way i i can't think
anybody would be better at that except
you know elon musk if he were in that
game
i'm projecting good motives because
those are the what's obviously in play
so i'm not imagining something
without evidence to imagine it
i i've seen no evidence that bill gates
has bad intentions
never i've never seen one
one suspicious
flag
now there is evidence that maybe he's
been wrong about a few things
right
but that would just be everybody we've
all been wrong about a few things so
so you know you talk about pushing the
vacs and you don't like that
the worst case scenario is he was wrong
that's the worst case scenario
not that he's evil
how do you how do you even get that
motive out of it can somebody give me an
idea of anything he's ever done
that would suggest his motive is bad
what what what has he ever done that
would suggest his motive is bad
now overcharged for software right now
he's left that business behind i'm
talking about his philanthropical stage
now epstein's island is his personal
life and again i'm not condoning or
supporting it
right there's there's nobody here to
support his personal life can we agree
let's agree on that there's nobody here
to support bill gates personal choices
that's just that's his problem
uh working with china on nuclear
do you know why
bill gates would be working with china
on nuclear
because the united states won't let him
there there were things that china would
let him do in terms of trying new
technology that you couldn't do in
america for a while but i think that may
have changed
i think the company he backs
is at
terra
terra power or something whichever one
he backs i think they've got an american
project going now
he is one of the ccp's chief
co-conspirators
like but there's all like generic
do you have a specific problem with him
infertility shots for africans
do you think he was
do you think that bill gates
was suggesting people be vaccinated
without their approval
i don't know what that story is about
vaccinations for africans but i'm pretty
sure that wasn't supposed to be without
their approval
if you thought that maybe you researched
that a little bit better
giving people options never feels evil
to me if you're
fully disclosing what the option
involves
now if you're saying that there were
people who died because bill gates
was promoting some vaccinations and then
it didn't work out
maybe
i'm not even sure i would hold that
against him so the trouble is when
you're operating at his level
you either say nothing which would be a
huge waste of capabilities
or you say something
and sometimes you're wrong
and sometimes people die it's like sorry
he operates at the level of a president
because if a president makes a bad
decision people die
right but do presidents ever make bad
decisions where people die
yeah even the ones you like even the
presidents you like
make decisions where people will die
so if bill gates did something that he
thought was going to be a good idea and
it turned out to be a bad idea
i would say that's a bad situation
but that is no evidence whatsoever of
bill gates intentions or capabilities or
or anything it's just something didn't
work out
 breaks
right he does a lot of stuff
if everything he did worked i'd be more
worried about him as being satan
right
like at least we know he's human if he
makes some mistakes and they could be
big mistakes but remember everything he
works on is huge
everything bill gates is working on now
in this part of his life is gigantic
you know it's like water quality and
sanitation in africa
these are big big things he's taken on
climate change right if he gets any one
of those wrong
a lot of people are going to be dead
but here's my take on it
i would rather go with his guess
even knowing he's been wrong
i would go with his guests over
a politician's guess
every time and again anything you want
to say about his personal life i'm not
going to have any argument about that
you can like it or dislike it that's his
life it's his problem
um
what he does with the land is what's
important here's what i think he's doing
with the land just to guess
protecting the
american food supply
i think that's what he's doing i think
bill gates is single-handedly you know
with a few other billionaires i think
they're buying enough land
that no matter what went wrong
he could plant enough crops to
make up the difference
because i don't think that what he's
buying i don't think what he's buying is
all used right
a lot of it would be
unused
imagine bill gates saying oh looks like
we're going to run out of wheat in the
year how many how many tractors could he
put on his land in a year if he needed
to you know if you're one of the richest
people in the world
no i feel like i feel like he's created
a uh
like an emergency food supply he's just
not saying it out loud
what else could it be
now it could be just an investment
because you know you might think
farmland will be worth more especially
because of climate change or whatever
could be that
you say he's creating an emergency why
would he do that
it's far more likely he's creating
a
like a solution
than a problem
zach says if we're a smart man scott you
are misinformed
zack how would you distinguish between
me being misinformed
and you being misinformed what would
that look like
so
i give my opinions in public every day
zach
do you do that
is there do you have the entire world
fact checking your opinions zach
because if i make a mistake
people are filling in the blanks as soon
as i say it
yeah the the moment i say something
wrong the correct answer appears to me
zach when you sit in your basement
masturbating uh to this live stream
i don't know
i don't know if you're right or wrong
and nobody's fact checking you
so you can sit there with one hand on
the keyboard and the other hand on your
tiny little
and you can tell me
that
i'm misinformed
because nobody's fact checking you no
no just sit in your little basement
there zach and
go nuts
people are still trying to get under my
skin by telling me my
ex-wife is having fun
who doesn't want their ex-wife to have
fun
like what kind of a monster am i
i
since since people are bringing it up in
public
let me give you an update
i'm fine
i don't have a problem in the world at
the moment
i mean i can't even think of one
my health is pretty good
yeah the economy is turning around
i can't think of a problem i have in the
world
honestly literally i can't think of one
i mean i have like
small annoyances
i don't have i don't have a problem in
the world can you say that so whoever it
is that was just
trying to mock me from my personal life
does that is that what your life looks
like
do you wake up in the morning and i have
any problems
because i did i woke up this morning i
didn't have a problem in the
world
nothing yeah i don't even have a water
leak today
i mean tomorrow probably but today no
no
i'm uh
probably as free and as happy as i've
been a long time
and my ex
you know i try to avoid all
i try to avoid all information because
you know you just you need that to sort
of process your new life
but
from what i understand
she's absolutely killing it
so i mean who knows what the reality is
but if you were to judge it on paper she
is upgraded in the best possible way
you know it's hard to be uh to have a
bad feeling about a disorder a divorce
if both of you come out ahead
and you know now it's like sort of like
it's a year after
you know we started talking about
divorce so basically it's it's a year
it's over for a year for me essentially
but i think we both came out way ahead
i mean without getting into details
about either of our lives as far as i
can tell we both came out ahead
and i i think we both enjoyed a lot of
parts of the marriage
so if you had a marriage with a whole
bunch of good parts
that i genuinely enjoyed
but there were bad parts you know more
toward the end and then you say oh let's
do something else
i don't really
i don't really understand why anybody
thinks they can mock me for upgrading my
situation
why do you think that i lost why do you
think she lost
why couldn't we both command ahead
because i think that's what happened
i think we were two reasonable people
who said
you know getting together made sense and
it did
and then when we said
being apart made sense
we both upgraded
right
now
uh you only lose when you shoot a movie
with alec baldwin
boy that certainly
brings new uh meaning to the word
shooting movie
uh
maybe it's time for alec baldwin to
shoot a movie instead of a co-star
yeah the trolls only conceive of
lose-lose because they're losers
who's the next scott college fund
recipient
so let me tell you a little bit about my
life arc
goes like this
now of course there's a prenup
who thinks i don't have prenups
come on
have you met me
i'm probably the least likely person on
the planet earth who would not have a
prenup like no but nobody no one would
be less likely than me
anyway
so here's my here's my uh take on life
when
when i started getting rich at the
beginning of the the dilbert phenomenon
um i had to
reassess my
you know meaning of life you know
everything changes when you go from
seeking resources to having resources
like all your decisions and priorities
have to be readjusted right
and one thing i promised myself is i
didn't want to die
rich because that would look like
failure to me
dying rich looks like you really
up
getting rich
and using it productively until there's
almost nothing left when you die
that's a win
because if i'm just sitting on my money
and there are people out there starving
what did i do
did i make the world better by sitting
on a pile of money while people are
starving
no
so i pretty much i'm always looking
about how you know the good news for me
could be translated into
direct benefit to other people
so how many people have i made
millionaires
quite a few
quite a few
if you count ex-wives and
ex-relationships and
people i've helped and their kids and
how many houses have i purchased
for other people
i'm not going to give you a number
but
trust me you'd talk about it if i did
so and i'm talking about you know family
members and stuff helping out i'm not
talking about buying a whole house
necessarily but helping out
and
and they're they're just
i don't know
hundreds maybe thousands of people i've
helped directly
now i try to i try to you know not just
spray money into charity i try to help
in some direct ways that make sense to
me usually people are close to me etc
so
my goal is not to die rich
so when people try to guess my net worth
they're they tend to be way off
because i always say well that's what it
would be
if i did if i didn't use it or give it
away or get married or have any
charitable impulses whatsoever yeah
that's what it would be
but it's not
that's what it would be
but i wouldn't want it to be that
because i would feel like a loser
if i had every penny i'd ever earned
like still
i would just feel like the biggest loser
david says i created life
i give that to you
i think if you created a life
you know whether you're father or mother
if you created a life you beat me
you did but you did better than i did
you know i i i chose to support life
that was already here that was a
conscious decision
and then a number of in a number of ways
i've managed to do that
so to me that feels better
to me creating life
wasn't my calling
but we need people to create lives
so
so if if i did something with my money
that was good for the world
and what you did was
have a child
that's about a tie
you know i'm not sure i'd say oh i did
better than you because i gave away you
know
or i productively used x dollars
um
yeah
anyway that's enough for that
um
there's there's no such thing as a
calling no that's young i'm what i say a
calling i'm using figurative speech of
course
um
yeah i don't think everyone should
create life
i made a conscious decision and also i
believe there's no free will those are
not there's no uh contradiction there
because you're conscious of your
decisions you know when they happened
so i'm conscious of my decision
but i also think it was going to go that
way
there's no there's no problem with that
all right what about bannon well do we
know anything about him yet the uh the
jury got picked we'll wait for that one
all right that's all i got now i i don't
have a date for the russell brand
conversation but i'll let you know when
i do and i'll talk to you youtube
tomorrow
and
