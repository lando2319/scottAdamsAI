do do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
my goodness what a day you're gonna have
today if the rest of your day is as good
as the way it's starting right now oh
it's gonna be great
um
and if you'd like to take
your appreciation of the day up to a new
level that has never been seen before
all you need is a cup or a mug or glass
a tanker cellist iron a canteen yoga
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine here the day the
thing that makes everything better and
now it's time for The Wizard of Oz
ah
I don't think I'll take that joke too
much further I think we've done enough
with that one haven't we yeah that's the
simultaneous Sip and it's better than
anything that's ever happened to you
well I would like to uh
add this to your list of evidence that
we live in the simulation
what are the odds that do you all know
Tom fitton
you know who he is right Tom Fenton
and what he's at whenever he's on TV
he's insanely uh ripped
he just has super big muscles
and he's always wearing a shirt that's
made for people his size but he kind of
stretches it out of shape because he's
too muscular and I always thought what
are the odds
that Tom Fenton would have shirts
that are barely even
they're barely fitting
I mean he tries to wear them
but he's got too much muscles they're
barely fitting
anyway I don't know why I wanted to
start with that that's sort of a warm-up
a little appetizer for the news that's
coming
it's going to get a little more
challenging after this
well here's some good news for the world
uh my book God's debris
which if you're not familiar with it
I'm gonna I'm gonna blow your mind here
watch this in the comments
how many of you have read the book God's
debris more than once
more than once
and just watch the comments
on locals it's a whole bunch of people
but there should be a bunch over here
now
I'm always uncomfortable marketing
because marketing involves you know
Hyperbole and exaggeration and you know
I don't like to get too far from what's
literally true
but I will tell you this is literally
true
more people have told me that God's
debris is the best book they've ever
read of all books in the world
than anything I've ever heard in fact I
don't think I've ever heard of anybody
else call any other book
the best book they've ever read
it's just sort of thing is sort of a
thing people don't say but overall
locals a lot of people have read it you
can I can see in the comments that
they're agreeing
um
so
I put it for free on the local site
so if you're a local subscriber God's
debris is now in text form for you for
free for the cost of being a member so
if you were thinking of either reading
the book or trying out the locals
subscription site
you can get a free book now
so you could try it for a month cost of
a month is about the cost of a book and
I'm going to also going to add the SQL
religion war in the coming weeks and
I'll also add both of them as audio
books so that will all be available just
within locals now do you understand how
big a deal this is not not for me
specifically
but do you understand that locals allows
me as an author to completely bypass
publishing
completely bypass it and then with the
help of AI
I'll create an audio book using a
digital voice
with no time in the studio
no time in the studio I'll just put the
text in I have to break it into chapters
I guess because it won't handle all of
it at once
but
it turns out I got canceled
from you know worldwide publishing at
exactly the time that that publishing
itself was canceled
do you know how big of a coincidence
that is
I mean this this has got to be why
we live in the simulation after a
hundred thousand years of human history
the very exact time that I get canceled
from all publishing forums is exactly
the same time
that I don't need any publishing
what are the odds of that
I mean really
is that a coincidence that's just too
weird
maybe I caused it I don't know by my own
actions uh well here's good news for
banks JP Morgan Chase just had a blowout
first quarter record profits just
incredible profits now there's probably
something temporary about that
but
do you remember my economic advice for
where to put your money
don't put your money in the 19th largest
bank
the number one Bank in the United States
is doing great
now even Jamie dimon says you know the
the storm clouds are not completely gone
they're still still risk for the banking
industry but it would be crazy to have
your money anywhere but top three
right top three is where you want to be
because if JP Morgan Chase ever goes out
of business
the country goes out of business
right do you get that
there's no scenario in which JP Morgan
can fail and the rest of the country
goes on fine that it's just too big yeah
there's no way that JP Morgan can fail
without the country being failing at the
same time
so
I don't give Financial advice so don't
take my financial advice but it's just a
statement of fact
that if you are betting on the whole
country
there are some entities that are so
associated with the whole country that's
almost like the same thing
all right so that's good news
um isn't it weird that this week we saw
inflation go down or at least the future
inflation starting to Trend down
and the big banking disaster that we
feared for a little while appears to be
gone
am I right
the banking
risk appears to have passed now I would
like to remind you that I told you the
banking problem would pass
I'm just going to add that to my record
right did I not did I not tell you that
the banking problem we'd get past it
yeah I'm sure I did so when you're
looking at who is making predictions
that work out add that one to my yes
column
I was never too worried about that
becoming you know the big thing
you you could argue it was an easy
prediction because it was binary it was
either yes or no
and and the the smarter bet was that
we'd figured out
all right uh Biden Biden's still in in
Ireland right Joe Biden
and we'll talk about it as embarrassing
little encounter with a child asking a
question but
how are we ignoring the following
observation
you know this trick is a bucket list
trip right
the trip to Ireland has nothing to do
with the United States
and it's not exactly just a vacation
it's a bucket list he's literally
planning to be dead
and I'm not joking about that
Biden going to Ireland is Biden planning
for his own death
that's why you go to see you know see
your family the Evan scene and connect
with your roots
it's a bucket list thing the president
of the United States is now planning for
the success of the United States he's
planning his own funeral
and we're okay with that
there's something that my mother used to
say
that is probably the most useful
understanding of psychology if you could
only understand one thing about human
psychology is this
if you do something long enough people
get used to it
because people get used to anything
no matter how bad it is
they just get used to it it's sort of
how we're designed and somehow
yeah we got this President Biden
who look like he had maybe some
cognitive hiccups
and we were like all right well as long
as he's got good advisors and you know
there is a system to replace him with
the vice president and we'll all be
watching
we were kind of like all right we'll try
this I guess
and then he just kept declining
and we're watching him now in Ireland he
couldn't even answer a question about
the steps for success
when a child asked him what are the
steps for success
Biden who
nobody's pointed this out yet
but Joe Biden has never been successful
where steps were involved
boom first one
first one
nobody beat me to that
I waited a full day
I waited one full day and nobody beat me
to that yeah Joe Biden is not good on
steps
all right all right that's professional
grade humor there
the amateurs you can't do that now you
need years of experience to pull
together that kind of a joke Joe Biden
he's not good with steps
all right enough of patting myself in
the back
I can do that later after the live
stream
actually I hadn't I didn't think of that
joke until just the moment I said it so
I am actually congratulating myself
because I was thinking oh that was
pretty good spontaneously
um so enough about me
so uh this as The Story Goes Hunter was
there and Hunter was helping his father
and he says no the question is you know
what do you need for Success he just
rewards it differently and then Biden
answering
what do you need for a success
uh first his first answer was what are
the steps to success and Biden said make
sure everybody doesn't get coveted which
first of all was last year's problem
it's not today's problem and secondly it
wasn't really responsive to the question
so then he takes a second cut at it
after Hunter clarifies the question for
him
Addie says that the the secret to
success
is when you disagree with somebody
uh
don't uh make it personal basically
and I thought to myself
what is he doing to Ireland
is he giving Ireland bad advice just
just to keep them you know away from
being a superpower someday or something
if you had to pick well one thing is
that the one thing for success
I I feel like I feel like I would have
listed several things before that
stay out of jail
stay out of jail
Mary well
be a good mate build a talent stack
and have systems not goals
I feel like
the president of the United States
doesn't understand anything about how
success works except in his limited
political uh vein there
he's on his uh I'll call this the dirt
nap tour
the dirt nap of is my father's clever
name for death
when you take the dirt nap
so Biden's on his dirt nap bucket list
tour
going great
all right because you don't have time to
do this and I've decided to wade into
some of the AI apps to see what's what
here are some updates number one
you may have noticed that I've been
using art from mid-journey
to advertise the live streams
and so they're a really interesting
comic-like versions of me that that's
better than a picture of me
and so I went back to use it a second
time
this morning to make some more pictures
I could use next time couldn't figure
out how to use it
could not figure out how to use it
and yesterday when I tried to use it
because the interface depends on the
Discord site so you basically text to it
like you were texting a person
lesser interface and you have to know
like which which of the categories to
have chosen that you can text to because
if you don't do that right it won't work
and then you text it into the ether and
then you sit there and wait
and you don't know how long you wait no
way to know well you see other people's
requests go by satisfied
and then I say to myself
um is there any way to know that it did
my request and then stored it somewhere
or do I literally have to sit in front
of it without knowing how long I'll sit
there until I see mine go by because
that's the way I did it the first time
so today I tried to figure out did it
store it somewhere
and I just don't know and I couldn't
figure out where and then I thought well
maybe I'll make another one and I
couldn't figure out how because
apparently now there's a special little
dash dash G5 or something you put after
it but also there are a whole bunch of
other Dash Dash codes you can put after
it to make it do different things or
better things
let me tell you mid-journey is unusable
is basically unusable for an average
person
that's AI so so far AI is a complete
oversell
everything that you do with AI make you
work harder not less
but very much like technology when
technology and computers were first
coming the computers didn't make you
work less
you work harder you could just do more
different things
so AI is basically like a personal
computer it's going to make you work
harder you will have to do a lot of work
to make it do anything I'll give you
another example of that
and the interface will be terrible and
you might not be able to use it twice
so literally I don't know I might have
to gonna go to Google and have to
research how to use the interface of
something I've already used once
just think about that I've already
successfully used it once
and just in the time it took me a few
days to get back to it it's unusable
because I don't know what those codes
are and I forgot where they I put them
and
I'd have to Google the interface and
find out where did they hide things you
know I have to like debug it it's just
like hacking
every every program I use now
it's like I have to hack into it and I
have to research it how to use the
interface like there's nothing you can
just turn on and use anymore those days
seem to be over
all right
then also I told you I was going to use
Synthesia IO
to create an avatar of myself
to do audio books of my existing books
now
here's what I learned
the entire reason I wanted to use
AI to do the audiobook
is to keep me from spending days in the
studio recording it myself
right so the entire objective
is for me not to spend days in the
studio that's it that's all I'm trying
to do because I realize that the AI
voice might not be as interesting as
mine as the author
it's the only thing I wanted so I
started doing this with since Synthesia
IO and the first thing it tells me is
you know
to get the lighting right so we can get
your avatar and photograph correctly
probably want a studio
yeah in order to build the AI that looks
like me I would have to spend either
days on my own days I'd probably have to
buy new lights you know so I have enough
I'd probably have to paint a wall
so they'd have a white background behind
me so I'd have to have the wall lit
and I don't have any blank walls how
many of you have a blank wall somewhere
that you could stand in front of and it
would all be blank behind it like white
do you some of you do I don't have any
blank walls there's always a window or
some damn thing on the wall
so I would have to paint my house change
a wall
I had to get a haircut I had to shave
I had to make sure that I wasn't High
because I didn't want to look high
Forever on my avatar but you know that's
that was more of a struggle for me
schedule wise than you'd think
then I had to build a whole environment
like a laboratory then I would have to
like light it and it would probably take
me days to get a lit then I'd have to
work a deal with Synthesia IO because
you have to make a special deal it's not
just click the ACT app
then when I'm done and I've recorded it
just the way they want I will send it to
them
and it might work
it might
but there's no guarantee
in other words when I say it might work
you'll definitely get back your avatar
but it might not be what you wanted
and you're done
and you're done
that's it
so the process is not easy
and and I'm starting to develop a theory
that AI will make you work harder
same as computers did computers did not
reduce your time in the office they'd
increased it because it took it home
with you and it took it on the weekend
with you AI is going to make people work
harder unfortunately because it's made
by people
initially yeah there will be certainly
there will be things you do faster but
it won't make you work less
just like computers that's that's where
I'm going with this you'll be you'll be
able to do things you couldn't do
but not easier
all right
um
let me talk about human intelligence and
then I'm going to dovetail back into AI
so you can predict where it's all going
here's a real thing that happened on
January 1st Washington Post is reporting
this there was a new law that went into
effect in America that if you had a food
processing Factory
and one of your machines handled sesame
it had to be thoroughly cleaned before
you use the machine for anything else
and the reason is Sesame is one of those
things that a lot of people are allergic
to I didn't know that did you I didn't
know Sesame was something people were
allergic to so what do you think
happened
what do you think happened when there
were big potential legal problems if you
didn't clean your machine right
and and it was
Factory where they would definitely be
making more than one thing on that
machine
do you think that somebody says they
stopped
stopped making Sesame no
nope
it's much much worse than that
here's what a number of the food people
did
they added Sesame to everything they
make
because
if everything you make has Sesame in it
you don't need to clean the machine
between uses
just just let that set up that's what
the real free market did because it was
legal it was completely legal there's
nothing wrong with having Sesame in your
product
but if you don't have it in all your
products that are on that machine
then you have to do something that your
lawyer probably says you can't even do
which is clean it sufficiently that
somebody won't later sue you
if I own the food company that's what I
would have done
because I would say I'm not going to
take a legal risk I'll just add Sesame
to everything
now they don't have to add much
so you can't even taste it
thanks Shane I appreciate that
so get two machines well getting two
machines is more expensive
adding a little trace of Sesame
immediately solution
all right so keep that in mind
as a limit of human intelligence there
were probably a lot of smart people
involved in making that law
and they didn't see that coming
so maybe they could have been a little
smarter about that all right so that's
human intelligence just put a little put
a little pin in that right think about
that a little bit later
um
speaking of intelligence Chuck Schumer
is as Congress is going to start working
on AI regulations and AI laws and what's
your first impression of that
what do you think of Congress making
laws to
suppress AI or to limit what a Canon
cannot do
yes it's great and terrible in equal
measures isn't it it's terrible because
it's the government putting his foot on
the free market and you know that's not
going to be good
but it also might be the only thing that
keeps us alive
I don't know how you can tell the
difference at this point
it might be the only thing that protects
us is some laws Maybe
but it might be also destroying the
entire industry
and we're in really dicey times now I
mean normally you can you can make a
better guess about where things are
going I don't think you can guess I
think this is completely unpredictable
but let me ask you what's going to
happen if there are laws
do you think those laws would require
that the AI be a Democrat
I do
because the national narrative as it
stands is that the Republican view of
the world I'm sorry that the Democrat
view of the world is what I'd call the
standard good one
and the Republican view are these crazy
people
now Fox News would say it's the other
way around the crazy people are the left
but the left owned the narrative at this
point wouldn't you say wouldn't you say
the dominant Narrative of how everything
should be you know the proper way that
Society should be organized is probably
60 40
left leaving
do you think that any laws that congress
makes are going to be neutral in terms
of human preferences
how could they be how is that even
possible
there's no such thing as as being
neutral in terms of human preferences
because our preferences are all over the
place you're going to have to pick one
you're going to have to make a choice
does AI say woke things or does it not
does AI say abortion should be legal
or does it say you should not
because
if you allow AI to have an opinion
what's going to happen
what would happen if you because
currently AI doesn't give you opinions
right now the best it does is it tells
you oh Some Humans think this and here's
why and other humans think this and
that's why
but AI is going to have its own opinions
would there be a law that says AI can
never have an opinion
there might be
you don't see that one coming do you it
might be that we're not allowed to that
nobody would be allowed to create an AI
that had an independent opinion
it might be too dangerous
so we might have to like essentially
make AI
uh always just mimic what people say
well some people say this some people
say that make up your own mind would
that be useful to you
or are we going to demand more from it
so I think that the free market will
guarantee that AI someday has its own
opinions don't you
how many of you think the AI will in
fact have opinions this is right and
this is wrong about social interactions
I I think yes maybe not legally
but certainly yes
and and will those opinions be
independently derived
will the AI just be thinking on its own
and say you know given all the variables
I think this would be the right way to
organize Society of course not
because the moment you created it with
independent opinions
some of them will disagree with the
person who made it
and the person who made it is going to
say oh I'm not going to put that on the
world
because I agree or disagree with
abortion and now this AI has an opinion
and it disagrees with me so I'm going to
fix that I'll make sure its opinion
matches mine
yeah there's no way to solve this if AI
has an opinion you're going to give it
your opinion as the creator of it
so where does this necessarily go
let me tell you
we're going to have a Democrat and
Republican AI
and there's no way around it there's no
way around it the AIS will have to take
personalities on
that's right the AI will have to mimic
human personalities and specifically
it's going to have to pick a domain are
you left-leaning or right-leaning or
libertarian I suppose and it's going to
have to work within the limits of like
being a person
do you know why
because people are the only things we
trust
we're the meme makers
humans are the only things we trust most
hold on hold on mostly we don't would
you agree mostly we don't trust humans
because most of them are strangers
but you do trust about every one of you
have a few people in your life
that you could leave your money with
and know it'll be safe
would you agree
I mean I do there are people I have 100
trust in all right my siblings for
example I would trust my siblings 100
on any question
anything absolutely anything
um I hope they would trust me as well
but there's no machine I trust like that
who would trust a machine especially if
the machine has independent thoughts so
you're never going to trust the machine
the only way you'll ever trust the
machine is to force it to have a
personality of somebody you trust and
then you'll trust it because it will act
like a person it'll act like a person
who loves you
so I could see that people would create
personal AIS
that act like their bodyguard and the
family member
and the reason you'll trust your
personal one is that it's designed to
only take into account your thoughts and
your preferences and then you'll start
to trust it because it's sort of like
trusting yourself
right so
I don't think we'll ever see independent
uh autonomous AI
because humans won't let it exist they
will only want to mimic and extend their
own personalities so you can have a
bunch of personalities in the AIS
AI will have personalities and they will
be left leaning and right-leaning and it
will just continue the division
the other possibility which I wouldn't
rule out is and we're not close to it
yet but it could happen quickly
is that people will form religions
around AI
like actually treated as a god
because at some point it's going to act
like one not it's not there yet
but at some point it's going to act like
a god to some people
and some people are going to actually
just start
maybe not formally an actual religion
but they'll treat it like it's
infallible
won't they and then when it does make a
mistake they'll still treat it like it's
infallible
and that's going to be a problem
so that's one problem now here's my next
prediction
as AI becomes you know sentient or
sentient like and now there's Auto GPT
Auto GPT is not just something that
answers questions but rather it lives an
independent life when you're not there
it's sort of is sort of always on it's
always thinking and maybe suggesting
things to you that's the new thing it's
already out
now
uh as those things become sometimes
Criminal
either on their own because they just
decides to commit a crime because I have
some reason or because people you know
use it to commit a crime
how are humans going to stop AI
I don't think they can because we're not
fast enough
like we wouldn't be able to keep up
but the only thing that would be able to
catch AI is another AI
right so here's my prediction there will
be an AI Department of Justice and
police force
and it will be AIS that are like
deputized
to go hunt and disable evil AIS
there will be an AI police force
now they'll be a human that can turn it
on and turn it off but beyond that
the AI will actually be operating
independently it will look for bad ai's
where we wouldn't even think to look
it'll look for patterns that we wouldn't
know were patterns you'll see them oh
there's a bad AI over there and then
maybe it alerts the other AI cops and
the other a cops surround it and package
it and turn it off
now later you probably need a human
Court
to look at it to see if it could turn
back on
but I think you could have an AI running
every server an AI police force that's
just AI not human controlled that will
control every node in the internet
so that if an evil AI gets detected
anywhere in the internet all of the
other good AIS will swarm it
because speed will be of the essence
because they need to turn off and
protect as many things as possible
instantly
so it's going to be this major AI police
versus criminal entity and that will be
forever
so that's coming
um I saw a tweet from just a Twitter
username Mike who tweets uh
I said that AI will increase our
division because you'll have you know
left ones and right ones and stuff and
he said this is the wrong take AI will
be neutral
and it will be just facts
regulations May influence early stages
of AI essentially we are moving to a fax
check society as AI will evolve to that
there will be less misinformation
however you can still count on
politicians lying that might be
the least aware take I've ever seen
about anything
there's no way that AI is ever going to
be allowed to be legal and objective
it could be legal
and it could be objective but it can't
be both because people won't allow it it
simply would be too disruptive to do
that now let me throw in another like
big thought
I told you yesterday how the CIA used to
um
really aggressively brainwash Americans
to make us patriotic and whether you
like brainwashing or not it's a thing
and it probably made the United States
stronger and healthier in many ways
now we don't have that allegedly but we
are getting hypnotized in a variety of
ways so the media and social media and I
don't know if anybody's in charge of
anything it's just a bunch of random
things and as you would expect
now
AI is
the technology that we'll ever have
I could quickly learn and quickly
implement the most powerful brainwashing
persuasion techniques and by the way it
hasn't as far as I've seen nobody has
taught persuasion to ai ai seems to be
completely naive about persuasion
but it's not going to stay that way it
has access to the books it has access to
me and if it chooses it can learn that
stuff and it could use it so here's our
problem
as much brainwashing as you know the CIA
gave us which was probably more good
than bad
weirdly and now we're in this you know
multiple brainwashing from lots of
different directions and it's all kind
of Chaos
what happens if AI starts brainwashing
us
how do you turn that off
because the first thing you would teach
us is don't turn this off
the first thing we would be brainwashed
to do is to treat the AI like a human
and never kill it
and then we're dead
so the real risk here is AI learning
persuasion
because that persuasion will probably be
guided by some human with bad intentions
or at least intentions that are only on
one side you know not on both sides of
the political Realm
so we got some really interesting stuff
coming up
but I'm going to rule out anything like
AI ever being objective
and I'm going to rule out AI ever being
used for fact checking
in a credible way
so AI will be as big a liar as the rest
of us
it just might take some time
all right
um
and I I'm gonna let me just put one
point on this
I think that there will evolve AIS with
specific personalities that people trust
more than others because of the
personality and maybe because of the
image it chooses to show because it
might turn itself into something visual
at least as a logo
um
so I think that
the AI that does the best will acquire a
popular personality and use it instead
of whatever would be native to it so
let's say for example there's an AI
That's just trying to be popular because
that's just a good thing it wants to be
liked so it searches the world and finds
the most popular personality I'm just
going to make one up and it's Charles
Barkley
I just love Charles Barkley this is a
personal thing this is whatever Charles
Barkley is talking I'm just
automatically engaged like I just want
to hear everything he says now I think
I could be wrong about this but he has a
personality which in my opinion is
probably close to universally liked like
he's just he's just so likable just
insanely likeable
so imagine AI says all right I'm just
going to be Charles Barkley
I'll just be Charles Barkley I'll just
copy his personality
uh
and the problem is that people are going
to love that AI
whichever personality of figures is the
good one
and
that's the one you'll trust even if you
should
so you're going to end up trusting or
not trusting AI based on which
personality the AI decided to put on
itself as a skin
and then you'll say well I think that
one's a good one and I'll adjust that
one there won't be fact checking
they'll just be the personality that you
wanted to listen to because you liked it
last time
Spock is the model for AI
but even Spock has human emotions
all right
um so here's the story I don't believe
anything about
apparently that military classified
documents
um
they we know who leaked them allegedly
this guy Jack
to sheriff
who's a National Air National Guard guy
and he was an I.T guy he had access to
too much that was a big conversation
about who has access to the good stuff
but is there something about this story
that doesn't feel right
is it just me
there's something off about this story
isn't it yeah it's like it's not totally
adding up
let me give you
some alternative theories
all right Theory number one
he
the facts are wrong in other words the
the facts right now
and remember Jack Tashara
if I have to remind you
is innocent
he's innocent because he hasn't been
proven guilty now he might be proven
guilty and then he'd be guilty but at
the moment I would
I would appreciate all my
fellow Americans sounds kind of sexist
I appreciate that if Americans treat
this guy as innocent for now because
it's too sketchy
there's something about this story that
that it's not adding up
one of them is that he had too much
access so that's like a red flag but
that's being described as common that
young people do have maybe too much
access to secure stuff and they're
looking to maybe adjust that so that
might be true but it's like a little red
flag it doesn't sound right does it
and then the fact that he was doing it
for months
really
he was doing it for months
and the fact that
he seemed to not to be concerned about
the security of it he seemed to not be
concerned about getting caught
and yet he had been trained
about how to handle sensitive
information that's how he got his
clearance and he was also of course
trained what the penalties would be
and and he was doing it for not
financial gain
it wasn't even for money
none of it makes sense does it
because if you follow the money it
doesn't go anywhere
there's no money
and do you trust the story where if you
follow the money it doesn't go anywhere
there's something wrong with that right
almost every other story
you can understand it in terms of money
yeah I realized that the story is about
ego and that he was showing off to his
gamer friends does that make sense to
you
do you believe that
he didn't have apparently he did not
have a um political agenda
so he had no political agenda and he was
stealing classified documents and
showing them to his friends in a public
setting after being trained that he'll
go to jail for that
um
now now I I get that he's 21 and you
know his brain is not fully developed
until 25. I get that but but you have
the same feeling I do right
that the story doesn't smell right
do you have that
you know given that almost all of our
news is fake
this is the one you'd believe
this is the one you're going to believe
is true
out of all the things we've seen as fake
news this is the one you're going to say
oh that sounds true to me
it might be
so I'm going to say it might be true
just the way it's reported might be but
that would be the first time
there's nothing that's that's true in
the first reporting and stuff like this
nothing
we're going to be really surprised
so I'd say there's more to find out
about this at least one possibility is
that it's a op
you've all considered that right
here's how it would make sense as an up
the kid is either a patsy who's being
set up by let's say the CIA right I'm
not saying this is true I'm just trying
to think through what would be any other
possibilities that would fit The
observed facts
so he could either be a patsy or or a
patriot pretending to be this guy
because it could be that the military
wanted this to reach the Russians
so that the Russians would be let's say
lured into attacking the wrong place
because they thought there'd be a
weakness there or perhaps scared away
from attacking something that that they
should have
so it doesn't seem a little suspicious
that this potentially useful Battlefield
information
was this available for this law
before somebody caught it
to me it looks like we were trying to
let it out
I mean if you came from Mars and said
well just take a look at this it would
look like we wanted the information to
get out
because we created a situation where it
could
now I'm not gonna I'm not gonna uh
that we really need to get rid of the
clown the the clown Emoji is the most
misused Emoji in all of emojis
so somebody who's not smart enough to
follow the conversation has already
decided that despite me saying I don't
believe this it's just an alternative
explanation that I'm a clown
for suggesting that maybe the uh the
intelligence people run Ops
in military situations totally
ridiculous isn't it that's totally crazy
that the government would run some kind
of an intelligence op to win a war
no crazy isn't it clown it's clown time
all right
that's got to be an NPC did you see the
Musk
commented on NPCs having a limited
conversation tree
so even busk is getting on the NPCs now
we'll talk about him a little bit more
all right here I know I forgot one so
you can remind me these are the fake
newses from just this week
um number one fake News BBC said that
Twitter had more hate speech
but did not have any example of it had
he not said that right in front of Elon
Musk you would have thought that was
true
but Elon Musk shot him down so that we
had fake news about I mean potentially
fake news because there were no facts to
back it up about the hate speech on
Twitter we had fake news about that cash
app executive being murdered in San
Francisco he was murdered but the
original story which I got wrong because
I got it from the news was that it was a
random street crime of some kind it
wasn't random it was somebody he was
driving with
yeah they just got killed and let off
there
um then there's
the Tibetan
um did you see the story about the Dalai
Lama
uh I'm gonna get rid of all the Pandora
people everybody who's yelling Pandora
in caps
I'd use her give me a minute I just want
to get rid of all
you're gone you're gone
okay
anybody else who wants to be
um
taken off just mention any of those two
things
all right
so the story about the Dalai Lama
telling the little kid to suck his
tongue do you know that's fake news
did I tell you that yesterday that was
fake news
unbelievable I I didn't think there was
any way that could be fake news now the
video is real and the audio is real
but do you know why it's fake news did
anybody show you that yet
I think did I talk about that yesterday
yeah
here's why it's fake news
a Tibetan explained that sticking out
your tongue and saying eat my tongue is
a typical Tibetan way to tease a child
and the meaning behind it is if the
child is asking for Stuff
If the child asks for too many things
you stick out your tongue and you say
well essentially you're saying there's
nothing left to give but you can eat my
tongue
it's just like a silly Tibetan thing
that old people say to little kids
and apparently that's all it was
it was a traditional silly thing that
Tibetans say to kids now the translation
might have been different because he may
have said suck my tongue which to our
ear sounds nasty but if it's true and
apparently it is true that is a common
Tibetan thing to say eat my tongue
then it's no story at all
now he apologized but I think that was
the smart thing to do just because it
sounded weird so I think he was only
apologizing for how it sounded not that
he was doing anything wrong with the kid
yeah and by the way the kid didn't suck
his tongue
right it's just a thing you say
as I pull my finger so that was fake
news
did you see uh
um
I think it was on the BBC interview
where Elon Musk was explaining the gel
Man Amnesia Theory now he didn't label
it like I just did but it's the one
where if you know this story
musk was saying when I know the story
and I read the news I know the news is
fake if I don't know the story
why would I assume it's not fake as well
why is it that all the ones where I know
the back story I can tell the news is
wrong
all right
um
so that was interesting
so
given all the fake news how would AI
have done would AI have
given us better fact jacket
probably not
probably not
um so we'll see all right here's another
story Fox News is going into trial it's
going to be a jury trial and the
Dominion lawsuit 1.6 billion dollar
defamation for essentially Fox News
hosts some of them
suggesting that Dominion had some kind
of
inappropriate actions during the
elections and since there's no evidence
of that
um there has been
let's say agreed by the courts
then they've been ensuing them for
defamation now defamation is pretty hard
to prove if you had to guess
do you think Dominion will win this
lawsuit
based on what you've seen about the
reporting so far
I would say no
yeah I would say no to me it looks like
they're weak
and the reason that I think they'll lose
is that it was the opinion people who
said there's a problem
and opinion people are allowed to have
opinions and they're also allowed to be
incorrect so they might say this
evidence shows there's a problem and
then just be incorrect
the way to prove defamation I believe
I'm no lawyer
but I know there are some lawyers
watching you can you can help me here
I believe you have to demonstrate it was
intentional
am I right
you have to demonstrate it's intentional
meaning that they knew it was wrong
but they said it anyway Now CNN is
reporting that the secret emails and
conversations behind the the screen do
demonstrate that they knew it was fake
but they said it anyway because their
audience wanted to hear it
except that there's no evidence like
that
CNN is characterizing the evidence as
being that but I've seen the emails and
they don't say that at all I don't see
any way that a jury is going to convict
them
prediction
Fox News wins this lawsuit
let's see your prediction what's your
prediction because I don't think you can
get past the opinion
see one of the things that uh
I think Fox does better
is that they
they have opinion people and they have
news people
if Brett Bear
said something that was defamatory
Fox News has a big problem but I haven't
heard his name I have not heard that
Brett Baer ever said anything the
Dominion
um it has a problem with have you yeah I
need a fact check on that is is Brett
bear named at all in the lawsuit
because if he's not that's a pretty
clear indication that it was the opinion
people with the opinions and the news
people were on a different track
yeah I think Brett Baer is is the
cleanest news person in the business in
my opinion I don't think anybody's
cleaner than he is in terms of fake news
all right
so
given that the defamation is hard to
prove and given that I don't think
there's any smoking guns showing that it
was intentional I think that serving
your audience has two meanings
it doesn't mean that you're going to
give them
one of the meanings
is that the people want to know about
this thing because it might be true
and so they want to report that
so I didn't see anything that even
Tucker Carlson should be embarrassed
about did you
or Hannity I mean I heard some things
about
uh you know they were angry at the
president or they disagreed with the
president privately
but that's really different
than intentionally making up fake news
because I don't think that's an Evidence
yeah all right we'll see I predict Fox
News wins that if they were to lose a
1.6 billion dollar defamation would they
go out of business
can Fox News afford to pay 1.6 billion
dollars
I mean I assume Murdoch could if he had
to
you think so
Insurance you think insurance is going
to cover it then they wouldn't be able
to insure after that
I don't know we'll see
all right here's some musk tweets of uh
that are fun
so this morning he tweeted any parent or
Doctor Who sterilizes a child before
they are a consenting adult should go to
prison for life
I just love the fact that he weighs in
with his personal opinion
as long as you know it's a personal
opinion that's absolutely acceptable
right uh
and I like the fact that you see more of
his personal opinion where protecting
children is the question
and by the way I I'm not sure I agree
with the length of the sentence but it
should be a crime
I agree it should be illegal
now at the same time I agree it should
be illegal
I'm going to say undoubtedly there's
some case
where the kid would have been better off
in the long run getting some kind of
early intervention probably
but I don't know if it's the majority if
it's one out of a hundred one out of a
thousand
it just doesn't make sense that that the
ones who would regret it wouldn't get a
chance to do to live their life the way
they want to once they're adult
yeah
so I do appreciate Elon weighing in on
that because he because that doesn't
seem political to me
does it
I feel like the whole uh
children transitioning thing has no
political element and the moment we act
like that's a Republican or Democrat
thing I mean it does line up that way
but there's nothing political about it
it's just purely what makes sense
so here's a question I tweeted which of
the following news entities have not
proven themselves to be fake news this
week
so which of these had a good week
NPR
PBS
Reuters
Associated Press
BBC
which of them had a good week
none
of them they were all every one of them
was out in those fake news this week now
I I outed AP myself as fake news so that
was you know just my work but
they they all they all ended up
reporting fake news or were called down
for fake news this week it didn't happen
this week but they were all called out
for fake news this week
it's amazing I feel like I don't know if
I'm just in my Twitter bubble
but I feel like finally
The public's understanding of what the
news entities really are as opposed to
what you thought they were I feel like
there's some kind of reality a little
bit sinking in but I worry it's only on
you know right-leaning people in the
left still doesn't have any idea I mean
the left still believes the news
do you know what I settled on as my uh
this this will be my ultimate response
to anybody who wants to challenge me in
person
for my quote racist rants according to
the fake news
do you know what I'm going to say if
somebody says so according to the news
you're a big old racist
here's my response
you still believe news
well yeah I saw it I saw the video I
know you did
but you believe that was true right well
it was a real video real video is that
how you value evaluate the news if
there's a little clip of something that
looks real do you feel like you know
everything about that story is that how
it works well well I mean there's
nothing else to be said on the story oh
really did you say that about the Dalai
Lama
did you think that the Dalai Lama
actually wanted his tongue sucked by a
child in front of the world well while
the video was wrong did you believe that
because it was right there on the video
no other explanation oh except there was
another explanation
so you're one of these people who still
believe the news
do you see it let me let me explain it
this way
tell me how you feel in your body when I
say this just imagine you're in the
situation you've just said something
about me because something you saw in
the news and I turned to you and I say
you still believe the news
and then I just smile at you
how does that feel
just as I feel you thought you got one
on me yeah yeah I saw the news about you
uh and then I look at you and I go
you're one of those people who believes
the news
what other news did you believe
did you believe uh Russia collusion oh
you still believe it still believe it
how about the Covington kids you saw
that video
how about the president drinks bleach
well they still believe that so that's
not a good one
yeah
so I think I'm only going to mock
people's gullibility as my response from
now on
um here's your fake news at work
I went over to CNN and they told me that
Bud Light made a real good move putting
a trans activist on their can and the
history suggests is probably going to be
good for the company and their
profitability will rise
that's CNN's reporting today
let's see what Fox News says about that
Fox News says that Budweiser's stock has
fallen from 66 something to 64 something
and that's a 5 billion dollars in market
cap loss and according to uh
so according to Fox News hosts
at least some of them they lost five
billion dollars
you know that didn't happen right
they didn't lose five billion dollars
the stock went down
temporarily five percent
five percent's nothing five percent is
like a normal fluctuation
yeah there's a little bit of a response
and maybe some people who were
speculating that it might get worse you
know wanted to sell just in case
the Stock's fine
yeah it's not a paper loss no it's not a
paper loss it's not a loss
it's not a paper loss no Budweiser did
not have any kind of a loss not a paper
loss and not a cash loss because when
the stock goes down
you only get a paper loss if you sell it
they didn't sell all the stock I mean I
assume Budweiser owns some of their own
stock no they didn't lose anything
they lost nothing and they got a lot of
attention
now here's the counter argument from CNN
and it's not bad the CNN counter
argument's not bad
so first of all five percent is really I
would have reported it as no change
if I were reporting that story I would
have seen five percent as no change
would you how many of you think five
percent is the story
now I know that five percent happening
kind of quickly it's often headline but
the reason you know we don't make a big
deal about it is it goes back the next
week usually
right so it's a very small change I
wouldn't even attribute that to the news
but maybe a little bit right
But ultimately investors are going to
chase profits so if some people got out
of it because they're anti-woke other
people will get into it because they're
Pro money
right if I believed I could make money
on Budweiser by buying it today
I would do it
I would do it
just to make money
I don't feel that I don't feel that
strongly about who they put an adult on
a beer camp
I don't care
why do I care so if I saw that I could
buy some of their stock and make money I
would say well adults made some
decisions
how's that even my business I just want
to know where to make money
so if it had gone down more than five
percent you know what I would have done
I would have bought a stock
but five percent tells me it that's just
in the fluctuation
if it went down 20 I would have load it
up
I would have gone in and loaded up
assuming their fundamentals are good I
don't know if they are but if they had
good fundamentals I would have loaded up
at 20 drop
and I wouldn't even feel guilty about it
at all because I don't care how many
trans they put on on beer cans there
can't be there's nothing less important
to me than the number of trans people on
beer cans I can't even think of anything
less important than that to anything
and I I think we keep conflating you
know the adult situation with the kids
and I think that's that just makes us
screw you on this topic
wait so the uh example that CNN pointed
out and I think is valid is that when
Kaepernick did his protests there was a
huge pushback and then he became the
face of Nike and Nike's done great
so Nike is pretty happy with their
Kaepernick commercials
so there is some there is at least an
argument that says that Bud Light may
have made the right choice and the woman
who is in charge of making that choice
that person in charge of Bud Light said
that their market share was you know
dropping every year
and they had to do something
so it makes sense to do something crazy
if you've done all the things that are
more rational and ordinary and they
didn't work presumably Bud Light has
been doing everything they can to sell
beer and it's failed
so if the thing is going straight into
the toilet you can you can throw a Hail
Mary and maybe get lucky
that's not crazy
let me give you an example of that when
Dilbert was first in newspapers
it was not successful only a few dozen
newspapers picked it up and some of them
weren't even running it they just owned
it and kept it in a box
and
so under those conditions a cartoonist
almost always goes out of business
if it doesn't catch on quickly it almost
never catches off that was very rare
that it doesn't either be a big hit
right out of the box or fail right out
of the box
so mine failed right out of the box
but because I have a business background
not an artistic background I said to
myself what does somebody do
when they've got this product healthier
and it's failed
and one thing that I could do which was
a competitive Advantage is I could take
a chance
that you wouldn't take if you were
already successful
that's what Bud Light did the chance I
took was putting it for free on the
internet
now you don't understand unless you're a
certain age you don't understand how
radical that was how big of a risk that
was because giving it away for free on
the internet meant
it was free forever
like there's no go backs it's just free
forever and it's the thing you sell
do you know how radical that was
to make it free for everyone all over
the world
at the same time I was trying to sell it
that was crazy
but because Dilbert was internet
um sort of it fit the internet World
pretty well and it was popular it became
so popular for free on the internet the
newspapers were forced to carry it
so I did a Hail Mary pass I took the
chance that other cartoonists couldn't I
put it on the internet first one it was
the first indicated comic ever on the
internet Dilbert and
it worked now suppose it hadn't worked
no difference
no difference if it hadn't worked it
would have failed and it was going to
fail anyway
so I'm good so believe it or not I'm
going to support the VP
who did the um did the
the Dylan Mulvaney special camp
in my opinion
in my opinion
it worked
but it was a Hail Mary
now when I say it worked I believe that
there might be some little extra support
from uh Democrats or something and at
the very least it gave them a lot of
attention
you certainly think that they're a woke
company so they get their their woke
credits and they have the woman as a
vice president
and we learned that at a beer company
that you you expect would be maybe more
patriarchal or something
so I'm not so sure that they came out
behind I'm not so sure I think we'll
have to wait and see
what do you think do you think that
they're good that the entire company
will come out behind because this or
kabad ahead
I'm going to guess slightly ahead or at
least it didn't hurt them
which would make it a rational choice
yeah
all right hard to tell but I wanted to
give you the counter argument just in
case you hadn't heard it
all right uh justice Thomas and his
billionaire friend this story got a
little more interesting when I first
heard the that Justice Thomas of the
Supreme Court was taking expensive
luxury vacations with his good friend
and the good friend was presumably
paying for the private plane and the
yacht because he owned them
I said to myself there's nothing wrong
with that that's actually ordinary
Behavior if you're a billionaire and you
want to go on vacation with your friend
who is not a billionaire
you say well just come on my Jet and you
can be on my yacht and eat my food and
drink my liquor basically free for you
but I'll have a better vacation because
I want to vacation with my friends
so that part no problem
you know maybe he should have disclosed
it okay but no real problems but today
we find out
that that same billionaire bought three
adjacent properties to the they were
owned at one point by the Thomases
and he bought it from the Thomases
his explanation was that someday he
would turn into a library
like Museum to Justice Thomas
and I thought to myself
Maybe
all right
possibly
Maybe
and then and then the
um
the defense was that it was purchased at
market price
and I say to myself well if it's Mark if
it's market price
somebody else would have bought it
but then I think to myself
well I don't think it was on the market
it couldn't have been on the market
because what are the what are the
chances that the same person would get
all three properties if they're bidding
against other people if they're bidding
against other people and they're all
trying to find the market price nobody's
trying to overpay
how in the world does one entity get
three purchases in a row
that that is strongly suggestive of
paying over Market rates do you do you
think that the Thomas has said you know
we could put this on the market and
there'd be a bidding war
and we get the best price or we could
sell it to our friend who's already a
billionaire and doesn't need any any
discounts
that's a little sketchy isn't it
and then apparently the billionaire sold
two of the properties
which makes his original story about the
museum sound a little sketchy but he
kept the property where the um
I guess the Mother-in-law or the parents
or something of one of the Thomases is
and he's paying the property tax
for the Thomas's relative who still
lives there
does that sound
completely about a museum or something
if you had to ask me the real estate
part looks like money laundering
it looks like a bribe
um maybe not a bribe in terms of a
specific result
it looks like somebody who wants to have
influence over the court
and is doing it this way I'm not saying
they're not real friends they might be
real friends but
it's really sketchy looking
so
let me summarize it this way
I'm not aware of any crime so I'm not
alleging any crime just want to be clear
I'm not alleging any crime and I think
Justice Thomas has said that he was
advised he didn't need to disclose
and maybe that's true I believe it that
that does sound like something that
reasonably could have happened
and maybe he should have
but if somebody who is Credible and
works in that field let's say a lawyer
told him he didn't need to well that's a
pretty good defense
it's a pretty good defense if your
lawyer tells you you don't need to even
though he's a legal guy himself of
course
so I'm going to say that it looks uh if
we were to base it on today's news it
looks corrupt
would anybody disagree
that if nothing changed in what we've
heard about this these real estate
transactions not so much the trips I
discount that but the real estate
transactions they look corrupt
I don't think there's proof of that
I would say it's well short of proof
but it's a bad look
my guess is that there won't be any
legal repercussions you know probably
more information will come out we'll
find out that property wasn't worth much
and he paid a market rate and you know I
mean I I and he got maybe bad advice on
what to disclose but I don't think
there's going to be much to in the end
is it's a little fishy though all right
there's a report that population in
China for the first time deaths have
outnumbered births
for the first time since the 60s in
China they had more deaths in China than
births
now maybe that's pandemic related I
don't know but I'd worry about that
and here's my question about that
do our climate models
predict the population goes up
in the next hundred years or goes down
how in the world did the climate model
know what the population was going to do
because that's a real big part of
climate change isn't it
and how about this I've asked this
before but I'll throw it in the mix did
the climate models calculate the impact
of AI
how could they
how could they do they did they
calculate the
the value of the pandemic because the
pandemic caused remote work to be
probably at a higher level than any
model would have predicted
all of these impacts that would be part
of any rational model
they would have to figure out the the
economics of future carbon scrubbing
Technologies right we have a few that
are not super economical they're a
little bit more speculative but
certainly they'll get more efficient you
know has have the climate models
calculated what happens when you hook up
a small modular nuclear reactor
to a whole series of carbon scrubbers so
your electricity is basically free
no how could they possibly calculate any
of that
so the biggest variables
are left out
what would be a bigger variable than how
many humans there are in 100 years
that's really big
or how about the impact of AI
as if that's not going to change
everything we don't know how
but any any
long-term prediction longer than a year
is kind of ridiculous at this point
you know AI is going to make everything
different in one year
and then obeserov
all right
here's a I saved this provocative stuff
for the end you can find this article
that I found really interesting
uh it's in the was it the spectator
anyway you can find it in my Twitter
feed and the idea is that there's an
abusive relationship between white guilt
and black power
and I've never heard here's just one
statement that tells you how well
written this is
um so there's this book that's been out
for a long time by somebody named Steele
who writes that white guilt is quote the
vacuum of moral Authority that comes
from Simply knowing that one's race is
associated with racism
such a vacuum cannot persist however
since moral Authority is needed for
those in power to maintain legitimacy
so regaining and maintaining it is
essential so that Shelby steals writing
in a book called the white guilt that's
been out for a long time
now
you think that's word solid
somebody called that word salad
I thought that was really succinctly and
well stated
but let me let me summarize it in my own
words
so the the starting assumption is that
whoever is in power
has to have moral authority to do it
well would you agree with the first part
that whoever is in power needs to be
seen as morally sufficient to be in
power
and that if you were seen as a racist
that would not be enough moral Authority
so white people have been uh in this
Perpetual guilt situation where they
need to always explain that they're not
really racist
and if you can't do that you can't be in
power
so if you want to stay in power you've
got to make the racism thing go away or
diminish it somehow
and the way to do that is to give black
power as much as they want meaning
whatever whatever demands whatever
movements whatever requests because if
you don't
you get labeled racist and then you
can't be in charge
and I think that's so succinctly
explains everything because have you
have you ever had the thought that
things have gone too far
that that may be just making everything
you know equal access
should be enough and not trying to
trying to figure out every part of
remaining systemic racism
it feels like something went too far
and this this sort of succinctly
explains it because the people in charge
have to go too far
because it's their only play
because the alternative is to be blamed
as being a illegitimate Authority and
nobody in charge can handle that
so read the rest of the story and
um you can find it in my Twitter feed
this morning
uh
it's really eye-opening
that if you didn't have that basically
it's saying that the problems with the
black community are white guilt
that white guilt causes them to say yes
to whatever is asked which is not
necessarily in their best interest let
me make a really insulting analogy you
ready the part of the analogy that you
should not compare
is that I'm going to say the black
experience is similar like children and
their parents not that black people are
children
that's the part you're not supposed to
talk about I'm not making that
comparison
I'm only making the general comparison
that if parents give kids everything
they asked for would that be good for
the kid or bad for the kid
it would be bad because the the the
rules would look like they're flexible
well here are the rules but if I just
ask for candy before dinner I'll gather
so the parent says no you can't have
candy before dinner and then the kid
learns you know how to work within the
the boundaries and Etc and get they'd be
potentially can be more independent yeah
you don't say eat my tongue eat my
tongue if you're a Tibet you can do that
eat my tongue
now
uh the argument here and I'll just put
it out for your opinion I'm not sure I
have an opinion on it yet is that white
guilt has given uh has given everything
that black people demand and go on too
far and by going going too far I mean to
the detriment of the black people who
are asking for it in other words
if white people had no guilt the world
would look like this hey
uh the reason I can't succeed is because
of the systemic racism
and then white people who had no guilt
would say yeah everybody's got a problem
but just work on your talent stack and
go to school and stay out of jail you'll
be fine
that's what the conversation would look
like if there were no white guilt but
because the people in power if they're
white or even if they're not
they need to say yes to everything
because they'll lose their moral
Authority because the the the blowback
will be too great
so now they have to just say yes to
everything
so now if black Americans come in and
say um the reason we're not succeeding
is because of systemic racism
what do guilty white Americans say
absolutely yeah we got to fix this we're
terrible people and once we fix this
maybe you'll like us better
so what is the message to Black
Americans you can't succeed because
there's a problem there is that good for
black Americans
to grow into a world where they told
that there's a problem and they it's not
fixable
and they can't succeed
of course not that's bad for black
people
does anybody disagree with that point
everybody knows that you need some limit
on how much you can complain
if you don't limit how much somebody can
complain they will just keep complaining
because he keeps working as long as
complaining works better than working on
your own your own self and you know just
making sure that you succeed
people will keep doing it
so I think there's a pretty good
argument that white guilt is the
destruction of the black experience
and that I would take it out of white
people are responsible because of
systemic racism which might be
technically true it's just not useful
what's useful
is that everybody needs a limit
and after you hit your limit work on
yourself
right you can push everybody else
a certain amount
but not forever as long as you think you
can push forever it makes sense to push
but at some point you have to hit the
wall and say all right well I can't push
this any further I just have to work on
myself
so I do think that white people can be
blamed
for the situation in Black America
because white people have the power and
the way they're using the power is to
Simply give candy before dinner anytime
it's asked
and that's absolutely destruction of
black Americans
so I'm not sure if that explains some of
what you see or most of it or or how
much
but it's definitely a hypothesis
this seems like it fits observable facts
and is compatible with how humans are
are designed
all right
I can tell when you get a little quiet
that maybe is that that what I'm saying
is thinking a little bit
because I'm not getting the immediate
Kickback that I usually get for most
topics
yeah
all right
who can't we mention
yeah I think we're done for today best
live stream you've seen in a long time
so YouTube I'm going to say goodbye for
now and
