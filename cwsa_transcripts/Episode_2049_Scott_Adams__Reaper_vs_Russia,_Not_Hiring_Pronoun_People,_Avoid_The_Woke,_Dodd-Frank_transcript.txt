do do
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams there's
never been a fighter moment in the
history of all time since the Big Bang
but if you'd like to see if you could
take that up a notch and I think we can
I think we can bump it up a little bit
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of tanker Chelsea Stein I canteen yoga
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure that dopamine to the day the
thing makes everything better
it's called
the the simultaneous sip that happens
now I can't read comments and do this at
the same time go
ah
now to answer your question in the
comments I'm very much not suicidal
very much not
I know it doesn't seem like this from
the outside
but I'm not having a bad week
I know that people think I am that I'm
supposed to be suffering but it's just
not working out that way
I'm not entirely sure why I mean some of
it is I just like to focus on the future
some of it is I like change
I do like change
sometimes
uh anyway we'll get back to that let's
talk about that uh Russian incursion on
the Reaper drone did you see the video
it's pretty cool
I don't understand the video exactly
because uh
it seems like that jet got really close
to that like way too close and it came
at it from the front
like it came at it from the front and
then it just pulled up just before it
would have hit so it could dump the fuel
on it
but here's my question
oh that was a rear view camera
oh okay all right I'm being corrected
that that makes more sense because I
could understand somebody coming up from
behind and pulling up but it looked like
they came from the front which to me
looked crazy
okay now here's the second question
somebody who's an engineer Engineers
only please
could the fuel alone and and just the
mass of the fuel
bend the propeller
because it looks like you've been to one
propeller you say no
I'm saying yes I'm not an engineer but I
say yes
but I would be surprised if it only been
one
one propeller was clearly bent
not not all the videos showed it
but wondered
I see unlikely I see no yeah the one see
here's the problem if there was a
physical contact would it be one blade
can you imagine physical contact
affecting only one blade
you can
I mean that propeller is turning kind of
fast she seems like the second blade
would be right there like immediately
um
you know even if it was a flying
aircraft that hit you know one slightly
the second one is right behind it
I don't know how the second one could
avoid the Collision
I guess it may be possible but then I
don't understand how it would only be
one propeller
if it was the weight of the fuel
I mean that doesn't make exactly a lot
of sense either does it
somebody says totally possible yeah I I
would say it's possible under the same
concept as
if you were to jump from a high space
into a body of water it would be like
concrete if you fell right right if your
parachute didn't open
and you landed on a lake or the ocean it
would be like landing on concrete
so the the mass of the liquid fuel would
be you know very soft if you just push
your hand through it but if you were to
slap it at a thousand miles an hour your
hand would fall off
I think
so I so it does seem to me that the fuel
itself could have damaged you
I don't know I'm going to put that out
there as a hypothesis
that the Russians are apparently trying
to recover the damn this stuff but uh
was it General milley who said oh we we
took care of making sure there's nothing
to useful to recover
do they mean they blew it up
and if they mean that why don't they say
it
you know don't you think that it
probably has a self-destruction
kind of a thing
and the self-destruction should have
worked fine because they had plenty of
time between the
you know the damage to the to the
propeller and the timing went down
but
here's my question
I guess I could believe that they
destroyed the software
right I suppose
maybe you deleted the software or
something
um but do you think there's no
technology in the reaper that Russia
wants there's no chip
there's no design
you know secret nothing I suppose if
it's just a bunch of debris spread
across miles there's not much you can
get but it's hard it's hard for me to
believe there's nothing they can get out
of it
does that sound like a lie to you
that there's just nothing they can get
this useful
now it's possible the other possibility
is that we know that Russia has already
had Reapers and taken them apart
or they've already stole the designs so
it's possible that we think they already
know everything about the reaper but we
can't say that out loud like maybe the
real answer is well I hate to tell you
but they don't really need to recover
the debris to find out everything about
the reaper because maybe they already
know
that might be the answer
that that could easily be the answer
all right I have a correction so this is
something that I got totally wrong I was
not aware that California has won or had
one committee coming up with reparations
recommendations but San Francisco was
doing its own separate one
so there I I guess I was confused that
there were two of them I did wonder why
one had much higher numbers I just
thought they raised the numbers from the
first recommendation so forget
everything I said about Gavin Newson and
his committee for the San Francisco one
but Gavin Newsom did play it correctly
with his committee the Statewide one
they came up with some ridiculous
numbers which is I'm sure what he wanted
so that once the numbers were seen
everybody would say oh I guess we can't
do that and that's the end of it but he
could say well I tried I formed a
committee
but the San Francisco one seemed sillier
because the people who formed the
committee you know seem aligned with the
people who came up with the
recommendation it's all kind of the same
little group so they're the ones who
came up with the 5 million per resident
97 000 per year for 250 years and you
can buy a home for a dollar
laughs
it's hard to even say it without
laughing
like
this is just so dumb
uh but then I read that
uh Robert Johnson the founder of bet he
wanted something like a 14 trillion
dollars set aside for black Americans 14
trillion
our entire entire national debt is 30
trillion
so increasingly the crushing national
debt by 50 percent
and and then everything would be good
it took three years for the San
Francisco group to come up with a
recommendation
what were they studying exactly for
three years
what data were they collecting
were they waiting for economists to give
them some estimates and stuff and did
anybody tell them that their Economist
did the calculation incorrectly I wonder
if anybody told them they calculated it
wrong now when I say calculated or wrong
I don't mean that the raw numbers are
wrong I don't know
but I do know that they didn't compare
to the alternative did they
they didn't compare it to the
alternative what what kind of a economic
analysis says let's look at this without
looking at what it would have been if
you hadn't done this the actual the
actual comparison would be to the people
who did not leave Africa in the first
place and were never part of slavery
that would be their that's the control
group
so if if slavery had never intervened
what would your life look like
and what would be your you know quality
of life it might be quite good it could
be some Africans who are doing great
maybe you take the at the average
but I wouldn't compare it to what
America is doing even though I
understand they were a big part of the
labor force here's why
the labor force whether it's paid or
slave they don't get they don't get
ownership
of the product of the work
imagine if the slaves had been voluntary
employees I mean that's a long way from
reality but imagine if they had suppose
they'd been paid
they wouldn't have they wouldn't have
any ownership of anything else they
would just have their salary
right and how much were
how much were white poor
Americans at that time earning
well I'm going to take a guess if you
were poor and white well you probably
earned was enough to put a roof over
your head
and eat
probably not much else
and I'm not going to compare voluntary
labor to slavery I'm just saying that
people were working for basically
survival at the lowest end
there wasn't that much difference in the
compensation part it was a gigantic
difference in obviously the you know the
ethical moral
painful you know Evil part that that
part was very different but that's the
part that would make sense to me as an
estimate if you came to me and said all
right we're not going to look at the
economic gain
because that sort of doesn't work we're
going to look at the pain and suffering
is more about compensation for the bad
thing that happened
but then the problem is that the bad
thing that happened mostly happened to
other people who are long dead
so if you took the approach of we're
compensating for the pain and suffering
your argument isn't as strong because
the people who are directly affected
have long passed so then you have to
default to an economic argument
because the economics certainly you know
they they Ripple forward so the argument
that that pain ripples forward is harder
to sell well people in my past had a
really tough time they were tortured and
they were slaves so now I'm in pain
and nobody's going to believe that you
know even if there's something to it
nobody's going to believe it it won't be
persuasive but if you say
uh early slaves created a bunch of
economic benefit but we did not benefit
from it
then it sounds like something you could
talk about
unless
the people you're talking to know how to
do analysis
if the people you're talking to know how
to do this work they say all right what
are you comparing it to
right you said you lost like you lost a
bunch of value
now compared to what
if they're comparing it to the white
people
well
I think that's the wrong comparison
because that's not the control group if
you were a scientist you you wouldn't do
that if you're a scientist you say
what's the control group oh the people
who did not have any slavery
that's the control group if you're not
going to at least compare it to the
control group it's just it's just social
persuasion it's not any kind of analysis
any number you come up with is just
ridiculous right now if you were to
compare it even to the control group I
don't know what the answer would be I
mean you still have to do the work but
that would be the proper approach
we'll never do that because the proper
approach would be what
socially
unpopular
there are only a few people in the world
who could say what I just sat down and
not get canceled
right
tell me tell me I have not already
extracted value
I've already extracted value from being
canceled because I can say this
because it's not offensive there's
nothing offensive about it at all it's
simply a statement about how all
scientific comparisons and all economic
comparisons are properly done it has
nothing to do with people it's just math
but I I couldn't even said that and been
safe I mean I have said something like
it but you know if if I had said
something about it like that before and
it became a viral video I would be
canceled for that just for saying that
reparations are calculated incorrectly
oh I could be canceled for that
absolutely because it would just turn
into racist says affirmations or not for
black people
you know you know you know the headline
wouldn't match the story because it
never does
all right
um
here's something fun
um
how much do you think wokeness had to do
with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank
let me let me get your now
yeah we're private
um don't be political now hold on just
just back off a set before you answer
try to not be political
right it's hard
I know that the politics in you wants to
blame the wokeness but a Silicon Valley
Bank there's no direct link
right there's no Smoking Gun of we
decided to do only meetings about
wokeness and nothing about risk
management right there's not a direct
anything
but really some most of you are saying
it was a big thing huh
all right so let me ask the question
do you think wokeness
was responsible in any part
with what happened to Silicon Valley
Bank
um a lot of yeses okay
all right
all right let me ask you a second
question
um so I'm not giving my my opinion is
there's no direct link no direct link
but if you're saying there's an indirect
link
that would be hard to prove
I would agree that that hypothesis is
alive
can we meet there can we meet in the
middle that the hypothesis that it
mattered somewhat not 100 but maybe
somewhat that hypothesis is completely
alive
and the and the common sense
as if Common Sense exists uh but the the
way to uh
Jack says woke broke you in half Scott
really
do you think wokeness broke me
Jack if you paid attention to nothing in
the last few weeks
if there's one thing that's the dumbest
thing you can say in the comments is
that the wokeness scared me off
look at that that is such a bad comment
it's like you don't know anything about
anything in the world anything about me
anything about the last few weeks it's
like you'd have to know nothing about
nothing or nothing about everything
it's just incredible like the the
variety of mental capacity in the world
just blows me away because you go
through life thinking everybody's at
least
somewhere around the average
and then you run into somebody who
clearly is operating with like his IQ of
70 or something and somehow managed to
log on to YouTube anyway and make a
comment in all caps all caps Scott Scott
well they broke you they broke you
so good work there Jack
anyway what I was saying was
um I don't think there's a direct
correlation but the argument for Wyatt
let's say the best way to say it would
be why it should be suspected
why it should be suspected is that
nobody can focus on multiple things
how do you focus on multiple things now
the the quick answer to that is well
that's just every manager right every
manager has lots of variables they have
to they have to make all the variables
work so this was just one more thing but
I don't think wokeness is one more thing
I think wokeness is such a big thing
that because you can show progress and
wokeness by simply doing things that the
data will will say are awoke oh
look at these things I did this program
this hiring so you can prove your
wokeness but can you prove you did your
risk management right
until the bank fails
right is the bank is just
chugging along nobody knows if you did
risk management correctly or not
it just it looks like it's right we're
still in business but your weakness is
really immediate it's obvious it's
visual it's provable it's or unprovable
so
Everything I Know About Management tells
me that people would put more interest
in wokeness than risk management because
that's where the reward would be people
will chase reward
that's why incentives work because
people reliably Chase reward
and chasing wokeness was where the
reward was
now that doesn't mean it's the reason
they failed
but there's no question that a company
that has that as a a visible goal
it would not distort their at least
their attention so you could argue for
sure it was a distortion of good
management technique
that's obvious
but whether that went the extra distance
and was an important variable in the end
product I don't know
here's another theory this would be more
the Democrat Theory because they don't
want to buy into the wokeness hypothesis
I don't think they should necessarily
uh but they say Dodd-Frank would have
made a difference and then I keep
reading okay and the the difference
would be because
and then it's not there
and then I'll read another article
article that says but there's a
widespread opinion that if Dodd-Frank
the the regulation on banks had not been
weakened by the Trump Administration
that maybe silicon Bank wouldn't have
had you know that uh the lack of
oversight that may have contributed
to which I say okay and the details the
details are the the specific thing that
changed was
was and I'm keeping looking for it in
the article it's like it's not there
and I finally saw somebody say well what
they did was they they changed the limit
of how big the bank is so before they
had a lower limit and the bank would
have had to comply to you know crushing
uh crushing regulatory pressure but the
little Banks didn't want that so they
said raise that rate so if you're below
this I think it's 250 billion in assets
if you're below that level we won't have
the crushing regulations on you but
above that level they can handle the
crushing regulations uh and it'll make
them safer
so some say that change that made
silicon Bank more let's say less
regulated than the big ones is
responsible
do you buy that
here's what I ask you because I don't
know the answer to the following
question
my understanding is that the bank failed
because they handled the risk management
wrong
there were two assumptions that they got
wrong
one was that interest rates wouldn't
rise very dumb but here's the part most
of the stories don't tell you there's a
part that's left out of most of the
reporting see if you've heard this it
wasn't just that they bought a bunch of
long-term low interest rate stuff and
then when interest rates went up they
had all this low interest rate stuff so
they were underwater it wasn't just that
is that that would have been fine
if the deposit flow had continued the
way it normally did
you know that
that even their bad risk management
wouldn't have been a crushing problem if
the deposits had continued the way they
had in the past but since their deposits
took a hit
than the their bad decision about
interest rates became very obvious
right it Rose to a problem when it
wouldn't have risen to a problem except
for the other situation now I've only
seen a few people smart enough to
explain that and they do explain it
sometimes by saying it was like a Ponzi
scheme but not really it's not a Ponzi
scheme it only in the sense that as long
as more money came in if enough new
money came in it could
cover the mistakes made with the old
money
I guess that's the easiest way to say it
so they had two problems and they they
it looks like they misjudged both of
them
but I'm not sure it was as obvious when
it was happening as it is to us after
the fact
because if they were depending on the
inflows and there was nothing that
looked like it was going to stop it
it's risky and it's too risky and it
shouldn't have happened but now let's
double back to Dodd-Frank
I don't know the answer to this question
so maybe you do
even without Dodd-Frank
is there no reporting at all about a uh
about the risk management position of a
bank
how was it that that Peter Thiel knew
how did Peter Thiel know he's not even
the government
it must be so obvious that the
Dodd-Frank wouldn't have made any
difference at all
so I think the Dodd-Frank reporting
seems like fake news
am I wrong
and here's what I mean with or without
Dodd-Frank was this problem as silicon
Bank not so obvious that the government
Regulators could see it as well as all
private investors who are paying
attention
what am I missing
it seems to me that Dodd-Frank has
nothing to do with this
so so here's my stake in the ground
I don't believe the news just sort of in
general the news is very inaccurate but
I feel like the little Dodd-Frank thing
is a diversion
because the problem wasn't wasn't hidden
deeply you know in the paperwork of the
company it was the biggest Top Line
thing that we're doing
Hey where's your money where'd you put
all your money are you telling me that
even without Dodd-Frank the government
can't see that
the banks don't have to at least report
what their Capital situation is I don't
believe that you're telling me the only
Dodd-Frank
requires you to tell where you put your
money in in the biggest most visible way
I don't I feel like all the reporting is
broken it's just it's just garbage
you're you're we're like picking through
the the tea leaves here to figure out
what we can know about this thing anyway
I think the Dodd-Frank thing is
I think the wokeness thing is unproven
I think it was probably an individual
who was bad at their job
I think it probably comes down to one
person who is bad at their job and then
a bunch of people who are bad at knowing
who was bad at their job
you know whoever whoever the boss was
also was asleep at the switch
that I think that's going to be the
whole story
all right
um
there was a video that was viral on
Twitter in which a young woman said some
version of she wouldn't want to work
with people who have pronouns in their
profiles
and I thought hey there's something that
I can talk about without getting
without getting canceled
so I thought wouldn't the world be
better off if I say this out loud so I
tweeted I'll say it out loud too I would
never hire a person with pronouns in
their bio is signals that the
anti-success mindset
now there last I checked there were
close to 5 million views
and I I can't tell how Twitter does this
I can't tell if the 5 million are based
on the original video that I retweeted
with a comment
or the 5 million isn't my number right
does anybody know how that works yeah
five million views would be the original
video not the fact that I retweeted it
so it's not my retweet that showing
right because I don't think I got five
billion views on my retweet
all right somebody's confirming that
yeah I think it's total it would make
more sense this total wouldn't it but
whether it was for my retweet or her
original which said about the same thing
five million people said
speaking as one almost and instantly
yeah I would not hire somebody with
pronouns
now let me ask you this
when young people are told hey pronouns
are good that's good put them in your
bio and lead with your pronoun is there
anybody telling them that it's going to
destroy their career options it won't
won't necessarily destroy their life
because they still have options that but
the number of options that they have
will be insanely fewer now here here's
what it signals to me if I see pronouns
um I just met you here's something I
need you to do for me
that's how it comes off to me
hi we just met here's something I need
you to do for me
that's a losing first impression
worst first impression you can make if
you're going for a job interview
you come in telling what you can do for
them and you never stop saying it
the only time you ever talk about
what they can do for you is when they
make an offer
when they make an offer you know you can
negotiate that and the benefits and
stuff of course because then now that's
that's the approved time for that
conversation that's one of your boss
wants you to tell them
or her all right your boss is looking
for you to say what you need but you
don't start with what you need you don't
walk in and say
the beginning of this conversation I'd
like to make it clear I'll only work
under these conditions
nobody says that but when you come in
with your pronouns you're saying here's
how you're going to treat me and if I'm
not treated in this way I'm signaling
that could be a problem
that could be a problem no I might not
Sue I might not necessarily Sue but if
somebody else sued you I'd probably back
them I'd probably back him if somebody
else did because that's the way you are
you don't like my pronouns
so it's it's such a
it's a signal that somebody doesn't
understand the basics of success
the basic elements of success who is it
who doesn't understand that a first
impression is really important
uh
does anybody not understand that and yet
the pronoun people seem to have missed
the biggest part of what they're doing
that it has an impact on other people
now if they if they hang around in their
their little clump of people they
probably just get praised for what
they're doing but somebody needs to tell
them this affects their career
and not just if it's on your resume but
if it's on your social media look at the
comments from hiring managers
those are the chilling ones the people
who do hiring for a living are at least
in the comments are universally
close to universally saying yeah I I
throw away every resume even if the
pronouns are only on their social media
like that's really happening it's a
pretty big problem
that the the the woke people do not
realize that wokeness is nearly the
complete opposite of success
like that all the concepts of everything
from racism to wokeism wokism there they
sound good at the moment and if you're
standing in the room with the persons
you're talking about
feels right
but any sense of what it takes to
succeed in this world is violated
completely by every element of that
philosophical framework
so if you want to be righteous and poor
that would be the way to go
if you want to if you want to be
successful
I would do the things that successful
people do
right
too dangerous to hire former cartoonists
yes I'm making it dangerous for all
cartoonists
um
so other people said yes signals other
hiring people were saying is signals uh
the higher risk of a lawsuit
how many of you think that somebody has
pronouns is more likely to initiate a
lawsuit against the boss
everybody does literally everybody
I would think that even the people with
the pronouns would agree with a
statement that the people with pronouns
are more likely to
um
voice an important complaint in that
Realm
yeah it's a signal
and more generally I would say
I don't want to spend time near any
cluster of white people who have been
poisoned with the wokeness narrative and
I say stay the hell away from white
people who have that mindset
so I was looking at some of the people
who believe the headlines and they were
saying you were racist
now is it a racist is it racist to not
want to be around people
who have been infected with a certain
mindset
is that racist
because that's you know if you take away
the hyperbole of course I said it in the
most provocative way but the the context
for anybody who missed the context was
mindset
did anybody hear me say I don't like the
genetic makeup of somebody did I ever
say that
did I ever say I think some group of
people are born with some characteristic
and I want to stay away from them
because of the way they were born no
that's literally the opposite of
anything I've ever said
Mike Mike's an NPC so on my NPC list one
of the things is backpedaling when all
you do is clarify your position there's
always an NPC who says oh there's the
back pedaling or this the fence setting
those are all the NPC comments so no
it's not backbeddling
to redescribe exactly what you said the
first time
the entire context was people being
infected with the woke virus let me ask
you this if you knew there were a bunch
of people who had
the Alpha version of covet would you
want to spend a lot of time in the room
suppose you didn't know which ones had
coveted and which ones didn't is that
racist
would that be racist no you're just
saying this identifiable group of people
that has a little more covid at the
moment for whatever reason I'd rather
stay away from the virus
but if that if that same group of people
no matter who they are
had a wokeness virus where their
priorities were about you know the
identity as opposed to success and
that's that's the best way to say it
that my definition of wokeness that's
the quickest one that gets to the point
it's a preference over for identity over
success
because you can't play both at the same
time
right I mean you could try but it's not
going to be as as good because there are
too many conflicts
for example you know I gave you the
whole list before but if you're looking
at the past and you know the evil of the
past that's the opposite of a mindset of
I can do anything nothing's going to
stop me you know look at the future it's
just opposite so that's the way I think
of it so stay away from people who have
that mindset and that's why
uh when I had my little provocations
that's why black conservatives
even if they were shocked by the way I
introduced the topic once they heard
what I was saying the black
conservatives were like oh I see what
you're saying you know I'm probably
better if you didn't say it that way but
I see what you're saying
it was a mindset thing if it had been a
black thing do you think black
conservatives would have given me a pass
what do you think do you think black
conservatives would have said oh
I don't mind you being a racist because
I'm a conservative
said no black conservative ever and
since the beginning of time no no black
conservatives know what racism looks
like
it's now something like mystery concept
they know exactly what it looks like and
they looked at my situation and said no
that's a mindset thing I get it that's a
mindset thing
all right
um
how badly does tick tock own our media
in this country
because the Wall Street Journal and the
New York Times Are reporting that the
Biden Administration wants to
look at having an American company by
tick tock
so that we wouldn't have this data
security problem
I don't even see this story on CNN or
Fox News today
did I miss it
like I looked at that the front pages
like this is news from late yesterday
it was on but it was on the fox website
I guess all I'm saying is it's it's
weirdly under reported in the General
Media but the New York Times And The
Wall Street Journal focused on it
so
I'm wondering if is there something
happening here that I don't know about
like you don't usually see this here if
you don't study the media here's what
you need to know if the New York Times
reports on a thing
they're what's called newsmakers like
the Washington Post and the Wall Street
Journal they make the news and then the
lesser entities decide to talk about it
because the the news has been determined
right this is the important framework of
how to see today that's set by the big
Outlets like New York Times and then the
others I'll just go and get on board and
talk about it but that didn't happen
this time
why not
why didn't that happen
I've never seen this before
that I can think of I've never seen the
the biggest Publications talk about it
and then the minor ones sort of act like
it's not too important
something going on there's some kind of
distortion in the system
yeah I mean I assume some China fact
but
here's what we know
so the Democrats apparently are more
interested in keeping Tick Tock alive
we understand that they think they get
their message out to their base a little
bit better because they appeal to
younger people in tick-tocks a younger
person sort of thing so you can
understand whether Democrats want to
keep it alive
but in the telling of the story even in
the Wall Street Journal
correct me if I'm wrong if I read this
wrong but I don't think the Wall Street
Journal mentioned any risk other than
data security
what's that tell you
it tells me the Wall Street Journal is
um
corrupted
by China
because the big risk and at this point
the Wall Street Journal should know is
the influence risk
but if the Wall Street Journal reported
the influence risk China wouldn't like
that
you know the the data security risk is
one that China can't argue about
right that's just pretty straightforward
stuff data security all right what are
you going to say about that no you
shouldn't have any data security
but the conversation China doesn't want
to have is that they can push the heat
button literally it's called The Heat
button and make anything go viral which
means they can program American young
people with one button
not that's not hyperbole that's an
actual literal scientific direct cause
and effect
known completely
every part of this is known and
confirmed they can
change your mind in America with one
button just by making one message more
prevalent than another that's all it
takes
persuasion is mostly repetition
from the sources that you trust
basically
so in the Wall Street Journal I think
didn't even mention that
how do you interpret
the weird holes in the coverage that
even though the Wall Street Journal is
covering it because it's a huge you know
business story
that they don't even mention the biggest
risk
the whole reason that it's like a major
problem they're talking about the little
one
uh it won't sell oh that's right and and
some of the argument is that it won't
solve the security concern
some say selling it won't that's what
Tick Tock says Tick Tock says selling it
won't solve the security is concern
that's a diversion
the security concern again is the small
problem
that's the small problem if they can
make you just think about that then they
get to keep their persuasion button
that's the big problem
so
um this treasury Department's been
stalling on this and there's talk about
having an American company buy it
but then there's talk about having an
American company only by whatever assets
would control the safety of the data
and maybe still the heat button is in
China
that's not a solution
but it's probably what we're going to do
because the public doesn't understand
the real risk so they'll accept oh the
government says it was a problem and we
solved it and then the Democrats will
say well I'm glad they solved that
problem they identified even though it
wasn't the right problem
and it wasn't the big one
all right
um the Pentagon and the justice
department are in in favor of killing
tick tock
and it's not happening
just hold that thought in your head
the Pentagon
and the justice department which are you
know under the control of the Democrats
essentially
the Pentagon and the justice department
are in favor of killing tick tock and
it's not happening
I don't know if I mentioned that the
Pentagon and the justice system are in
favor of killing it and it's not
happening but also did you know the
Pentagon and the justice system are in
favor of killing it and it's not
happening
that's everything you need to know right
there
took him two years
and they have everything they need to
know the Pentagon wants to stop it
it's a national security problem
how is this not getting through
now obviously the answer is it is
getting through and the the Democrats
just want Tick Tock for political
reasons
now you know what else is not being
discussed
the availability for children
because those are two different
questions one is do you let children use
tick tock a terrible idea and two does
anybody use tick tock because it could
influence our elections in blah blah
and some of these articles just sort of
gloss over that is damaging to Children
clearly damaging to Children obviously
damaging to children
yeah everything about this is corrupt so
the Democrats have literally chosen
China over the United States in terms of
security
and Democrats over their own children
they're they're choosing power over the
well-being of their own children and
it's obvious
and is direct
it's not indirect this isn't like did
wokeness have some kind of an impact on
Silicon Valley I don't know maybe yes
maybe no
but this is direct
everybody knows that is that a 13 year
old on Tick Tock is going to have some
mental health problems we all know that
and we're not doing it the the it's just
amazing that the Democrats can do this
right in front of us
right in front of you and it makes no
difference at all it's like the
government could not be more broken all
right here's uh Vivek talking about
Vivek ramaswamy talking about uh Silicon
Valley Bank
and I'm going to disagree with him here
even though I've endorsed him
he talks about uh
so I'll give you the lead up he goes
svb's ESG report lists a Litany of quote
cross-function working groups including
a sustainable Finance group that
monitors progress against their climate
commitment and monitors operational
greenhouse gas reduction initiatives
and then uh Vivek says he sums up by
saying taxpayers shouldn't vindicate
silicon Valley's political hubris
does that make sense to you
that taxpayers shouldn't vindicate
um
their political hubris
no that doesn't make any sense
because
the the leaders have all been punished
the leaders aren't getting a benefit
they lost their jobs and their
reputations
they got they got cleaned out the
investors got cleaned out but Vivek is
treating the depositors who did nothing
wrong
depositors trusted their government
and they shouldn't have because I would
have trusted the government to be
watching the banks didn't you didn't you
think the government was watching you
know at least the capital allocation
part
I just thought that was basic government
stuff you said no some people said no I
just assumed they were but I also assume
that most depositors feel that the
governments got their back
so confusing the depositors who were
just victims of this with the management
who were culpable and then the investors
in the bank who at least they were
professional investors so you know they
were taking the risk that
you know any investor takes so you can't
feel you know too crocodile tears for
the investors or the managers but to act
as though the depositors who were the
victims
I don't see how that could possibly hurt
us in the long run if we don't let the
victims be victims
I feel like the management got punished
enough
that it would make them not want to do
it a second time is there anybody who's
going to look at Silicon Valley Bank and
say all right all right if we do the
same thing and we manage poorly
okay this could work out the at least
our depositors will be covered by the
government uh all and the only bad thing
will happen to be is I'll lose my job
and my reputation
okay I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it
because the depositors are covered I
feel like Vivek is just completely wrong
on this what do you think
as soon as you conflate the deposit or
risk with the bank management risk
you're in Crazy Town that doesn't make
any sense
Vivek is totally right so you think the
depositors who are innocent
should suffer
because the management did something and
the government was not doing their
oversight
so therefore the depositor should suffer
okay so people say yes as long as you
can say yes to the the full proposition
then at least you have a consistent
opinion I respect consistent opinions
I don't agree with it because I think
there would have been a bank run I think
the risk of a bank run was too big
so that the benefit to you
was probably large
probably large now that's now none of us
know whether the bank run would have
happened or not or even if it happens
yet
but it definitely would have made a
higher chance
I don't think there's any doubt in that
would you doubt that there was a higher
chance of a bank run if the depositors
had not been covered how about that what
would you agree that there would be
higher higher risk but we don't know if
it would have happened it just would
have been a higher risk
yeah
okay so here's my wrap up of that
that's not a higher risk I would
tolerate at any level
the risk of a bank run you want that to
be zero
like 10 risk of a bank run no thank you
uh nope nope I don't want a 10 risk of a
bank run if I can bring that to five I'm
going to spend a lot of money to do it
right
all right
um
I saw Sam Harris was getting some
attention for saying that he was using
Candace Owens more as an example I think
that he said she isn't worthy of having
an opinions on vaccines or climate
change
do you agree with that do you think
Candace Owens uh
I hate the words he's using not worthy
of I think he means not credentialed
enough but not worthy says Sam Harris of
having opinions on vaccines and climate
change
well let's compare her to The Experts
shall we
I think he raises a good question
should you trust Candace Owens more than
the experts here's my first question Sam
have you compared their track records
seriously
have you compared everything Candace
Owens has ever said on all kinds of
topics because we all talk about all the
news she doesn't talk about some of the
news she talks about it all all the big
stuff
have you looked at what she said about
everything every part of the pandemic
every part of anything else and compare
that to The Experts
if you tell me that you know she did
worse than the experts I would say how
do you know that
how do you know that where's that
evidence because anecdotally I don't see
it do you
I do see things that in my opinion she
got wrong which would be true of every
person
right being wrong is not any kind of a
criticism really more of an observation
we're all wrong
like everybody gets to be wrong if you
do this kind of work
so
I would just put that out there that I
don't think there's any evidence that
she has not beaten the experts because
she does have one skill
she has lots of skills but one skill
that stands out what would that be
what would be a good
Candace Owens skill right BS detector
that is correct her her BS detector is
pretty good
and somebody with a good BS detector can
beat the experts
they can beat the experts all they do is
they focus on the ones that are
obviously wrong
now if you said I'd like to use Candace
Owens as my doctor
for all of my medical issues well I
would think that would be a bad idea I
would go with an actual doctor in that
case but
if the medical community
tells you that let's say oh I don't know
that drinking alcohol might be good for
your health
how about that
that's that's the one that I call then
as 20 years ago and now it's
more and more clear that that was never
true now am I a doctor would Sam Harris
think that you should listen to me over
the medical community yes you should yes
you should in that specific question yes
you should because I I identified the
 the reason for it the entire
mechanism of why why anybody would have
said it the reason that some of the you
know some of the uh studies agreed with
each other I laid it all out it was all
right every bit of it was right as far
as we know that's the current
understanding
that having smart people with BS
detectors tell you there's something
from the medical community is not true
there are people who can do that and do
have a little track record of doing it
again not everything not everything but
nobody gets everything right
all right now here's a here's an example
of the experts all right trust the
experts by coincidence
um there were two tweets that were right
next to each other physically on Twitter
in my feed because I was looking for
long coveted one of the stories was from
scientific America
and it said that long covet is a
neurological disease and maybe 16
million people have it and
it's even young healthy people and you
know other other estimates say it could
be like 40 percent of people who had
covered might have long coveted it's
really bad and blah blah do you know
what they don't mention anywhere in the
article
do you know what's not mentioned it's a
whole big scientific America article
about long covet
they never mentioned
the possibility
that it's a vaccination problem
now I don't think it is
but how do you rule that out
how in the world do you keep that out of
the article that's a giant tell it's a
gigantic tell
for this being a plant by the Pharma
industry
what it looks like is we're being primed
for drugs that treat long covet
that's what it looks like it does not
look like this was a real article it
looks like a fake article meaning that
it was influenced by somebody who has a
longer term agenda because I don't think
you could write this honestly without at
least saying you know half of the
country thinks it's the vaccinations
and we don't really know
it did point to a study which I had not
seen this said that the vaccination if
it had any beneficial impact on Long
covet it was sort of in the 15 range one
five
and that wasn't as much of a benefit as
they had imagined now let me ask you
this
if you knew that long covered was real
and not the kind that lasts a month but
the kind that lasts apparently the rest
of your life if you knew that was real
would you take a 15 chance of reducing
it
by accepting whatever the risk of the
vaccination itself is
say no
well
so so you would say that more than 15
percent
no let me do the numbers right it's not
100 of people get long covered so it's a
15 chance you would help a little bit on
something that's only a percentage of
the population so first of all you
wouldn't know if you would be the one
who got long covered or were susceptible
and then there would only be a 15 chance
that if you were in the group who might
get it it would be better
now if you were let's say older and you
had comorbidities
the speculation is that the worse your
covet is the higher your chance of long
covet
but
um
clearly at this point
the long covet doesn't seem to be a big
factor for vaccinations now that was one
of my biggest that was one of my biggest
variables
one of my biggest variables was well
you know I don't know but I don't want
long covet so if it makes any difference
to that I'd like to reduce my long
coveted risk
but
I don't think we know anything about
anything
the very the very next article that was
next to this one saying that long covet
has all these problems there's another
expert saying yes it's the shots
it's the vaccination yeah it's not long
covered it's just the vaccination giving
you these long problems do I believe
that
no
but I don't rule it out
how can I rule it out
but also how can I believe it so
basically it's a claim that I just look
at and go I don't know
could be
so my best guess is that both covid and
the vaccination
harm some people
what do you think
best guess both the vaccination and the
covet will harm some people
yeah now if you think you know which one
would harm them the most I think that
gets into
a pretty uh vague territory there
but it could go either way I would say
I'd be open to it going either way
yeah now given that I was far more
concerned about
um long covet then death
um I don't know I guess we're just all
guessing
in the end we were all guessing
I know you weren't you were reading the
tea leaves correctly weren't you from
the very beginning
from the very beginning
well we all think that but uh I won't
talk you out of it
um
to me I would say that both the here's
my take
well I think it's likely that both the
vaccination and the covid could hurt
some types of people
I don't know which group would be bigger
and I'm not sure I would ever believe
any data that told me one way or the
other I feel like we're in territory
that you will never be able to trust any
data in that realm I don't think I ever
would
um
but I will say this for sure some
portion of it is fake
some portion of what people are
reporting as long covet is certainly not
I just don't know what percentage that
is so there's on top of whatever is
almost certainly a real medical thing on
top of it there's definitely a massive
area
there's a massive story about the shots
and there's a massive story about the
covet and long covet
if you see somebody with long covet
how do you know they wouldn't have had a
problem anyway
well how do you know if you take a bunch
of people and make them sedentary for
two years and you ruin their mental
health and you make them fat and
overweight
and then they complain later that they
have a constellation of different
symptoms
see here's the other tell here's the
tell for a mass hysteria this is what
would make me believe long covered was
real
every time we see long covet it's the
same symptom
yeah it's always brain fog let's just
say but people don't do that they say oh
I have 15 different problems
and the next person will come in well I
have 15 problems too they're not even
the same as the last person
that's a tell for Mass Hysteria
not a guarantee
not a guarantee it's entirely medically
possible that one thing could cause a
variety of symptoms and lots of
different Realms it's just unlikely
it's just unlikely if you see that
possibility you go well maybe but a mass
hysteria would be like I don't know
eighty percent of the time that would be
the explanation
probably probably in
yeah so too many too many explanations
for a thing means it's probably false
and too many symptoms for a thing
is a real strong signal that they're not
all real
if something is real
to either the long covet or the long
vaccination I guess if there's something
real probably the total constellation of
symptoms is in the you know three or
fewer
but when you see 15
there's something else going on top on
top of whatever's real there's something
not real happening
same thing I said about the so-called
Sonic secret weapon being used on the
embassies which we now believe did not
exist but yet there were all these
people with real problems
the people who were diagnosed with all
kinds of problems from what they thought
could have been a secret Sonic weapon
they had real problems
so just like these coveted people and
maybe vaccination injury but we don't
know uh they probably have real problems
but people do
people just have real problems
all right
um
Rasmussen did a poll on Trump and said
52 percent of likely voters view Trump
favorably
does that sound possible
we're talking not we're not talking
Republicans we're talking
all registered voters
52 percent of them have a positive
feeling
do you think it's because things are
going so poorly
that everything Trump did look smarter
which was one of my best predictions
wasn't it
do you remember when I predicted that
when he lost I said every day he's going
to look better
and part of the reason I said was
because the Democrats either have to do
what he did the stuff that works or they
have to do the opposite of what he did
and it's going to fail miserably and
you're going to see it such as the
Border
Biden just sort of had to do whatever
Trump didn't
and the huge failure everybody can see
it what about the war in Ukraine we know
how Trump usually handles stuff by
threatening and being so unpredictable
that nobody wanted to mess with him
don't know that that would have worked
every time don't know that it would have
worked in this specific case in the
Ukraine but everybody can see that he
had a process that worked
and Biden's got us into a major war
like it's hard to to miss that everybody
can see that the economy seemed good
under Trump and now now so good
right now of course the Democrats will
blame Trump for you know weakening
Dodd-Frank but they'll never explain
you know how that's connected
yeah I don't know that maybe is real
maybe it's real I I wonder if there's
just a polling problem here but
typically you'd get
you would get Trump under under reported
right his his supporters would be
underreported typically but now it seems
the other way I don't know this was a
Puzzler
all right uh let's check on a couple of
my predictions now uh some of you get
annoyed when I tell you I got a
prediction right but you should
understand that that's what we do here I
make predictions and then later I tell
you if they were wrong or right and
that's how you can judge whether I'm
good at predicting and then maybe we
learn something about what kind of
things you can and cannot predict so
part of the fun is I have to check my
predictions right so the bragging if I
get one right I can't help that because
we're I do the ones that I get wrong as
well
um how many of the 2 000 mules have been
found so far
anybody
did we find those two thousand mules the
ones who allegedly uh were dropping off
all of those ballots and we had cameras
and we had we had cell phone data
no we didn't have cameras everywhere but
we had cell phone data I I believe Zero
have been found can somebody confirm
we found zero do you remember my
prediction
my prediction was the lack of finding a
mule even at the beginning
was a huge red flag
and I said you're gonna have to wait to
see if they find a mule if they find no
mules
that's all you need to know
right if they do find mules I you know
if they had found two mules
I would be pretty persuaded that there
are more mules
but zero mules
zero
so I'm going to call this a accurate
maybe not prediction but a framing of it
the accurate framing was there's
something obviously missing which is at
least one mule
and that if that's not produced in a
fairly short amount of time let's say
give it a year a year is a year enough I
think a year is enough
give it a year and then form your
opinion
so we've given it a year
and now I form my opinion that it was
not persuasive
anybody disagree
right so I think that was I think that
I'm going to claim that as a a
reasonable take it wasn't a prediction
because I couldn't predict which way it
would go but it was a reasonable take it
was a wait and see take and I think that
was that was the right way all right
here's one that
uh I can't even pretend not to brag
about this one
all right this is going to be a little
bit braggy
um I've been telling you that I think
Putin is trying to degrade the Wagner
group and he's at he actually wants his
own side to get ground down so that
Wagner doesn't have much too much power
in Russia after it's done
well it turns out that's a growing
opinion
so this is from
CNN I think uh talking about the Wagner
group and apparently there are people
who know what they're talking about who
are now agreeing with that take let me
read this from CNN he spent heavily
um this is progression the head of the
Wagner group he spent heavily on
recruiting as many 40 000 prisoners to
throw into the fight but they've had
staggering losses and they're
complaining about not having enough
ammunitions and and not having
reinforcements and stuff
uh all while accusing Russia's Ministry
of Defense of trying to strangle his
forces
so right now Wagner the head of the
Wagner group is saying what I said
that it's intentional it's not a
shortage that Russia is trying to take
him out now if he's the only one who
said it well that wouldn't be that
persuasive because maybe that's just a
way to get more ammo but here's what CNN
says quote many analysts
many analysts
think your suspicions are well founded
that Russia's military establishment is
using the bakmut meat grinder to cut him
down to size or eliminate him as a
political force altogether
that's that's what I predicted
now am I the first person you heard say
it yes or no
I believe I'm the first public person
who said it looks to me that Putin wants
to kill
his own General
and now that is according to CN is what
quote many analysts think and it's what
progression thinks himself
now can you give me the Win For That
do I get the win for that I suppose it's
too early to know for sure right
can't know for sure because it was a
little bit of a Putin mind reading
situation but I did front run the
experts
so I guess that's the only thing I could
claim I'll claim that I I sought earlier
than the experts are saying in public
they may have seen it earlier privately
now
I think that was one of my best
predictions
now that prediction uh here's what you
learn from the predictions
what you learn is which kinds of
predictions will work
I believe that when I make a prediction
that's based on organizational
infighting
you should pay attention
all right I'm really really good at the
category of organizational
Intrigue and infighting it's sort of the
whole Dilbert realm it's what I do for a
living is figuring out how people deal
with each other in in group situations
so I think I just saw it faster because
my brain is tuned to
you know group Intrigue like group
Intrigue is what I focus on and write
about every day
is group Intrigue and this was group
Intrigue one group against another
so I think I just had a filter that
works now what should you not believe
Beyond I think I'm also pretty good at
detecting BS
you know not 100
but they're definitely things you
shouldn't trust Beyond I'll give you an
example when I predicted who Trump would
pick for a vice president
don't believe me on that
that that's something that you'd have to
be a real Insider to even know what's
going on there because there's lots of
deal making and you know what state is
this and who did this and uh who likes
who who gets along personally I can't
predict any of that
but uh
I can't predict any of that
all right um
I saw a story uh I think this was also
CNN where nearly 90 percent of
blueberries and green bean samples had
concerning findings of insecticides
like a lot
like all 51 different pesticides
now not on each being but you know beans
in general I guess had 51 different
pesticides and I guess there are some
some types of foods that have fewer
pesticides but blueberries and beans
have tons now
have we not been told by experts forever
to ease some more blueberries and beans
am I wrong that blueberries and beans
have always been like right on the high
end of things that are good for you
and science didn't didn't stop to tell
us
however
however we don't like to say this
they're very very good for you
and also coated with poison
well but the blueberry is good for you
can I buy a blueberry that's not coated
with pesticides
well that's not what we're talking about
that's another issue but if you could
get the blueberry
like if you could somehow get it out
from underneath all the pesticides that
have you know completely absorbed within
it if you could do that that blueberry
would be good for you and then you say
all right all right if I could get the
pesticides off it that I can't the
blueberry would be good for me
hypothetically
but
are you the same people that told me
that the food pyramid was the way to eat
well yes yes
wait a minute and that was complete
 wasn't it
maybe maybe a little bit so why would I
believe anything you say about
blueberries being good for me
because we're scientists we're
scientists
I don't know what to believe my current
belief is that our food Our Food
Supplies are killing us
I don't think that's a strong statement
I think that our food
that that in the same way that maybe
Dodd-Frank didn't do a good job on
regulation maybe I don't know uh I feel
like our food industry is unregulated in
the sense that they can sell Us Poison
and we can't do anything about it
because we don't have options like even
the free market
can't help us
because we don't have good options
now I kind of get that you need the
pesticides to get the quantity
but is it literally true that we we
decided to keep people from starving
but we'd have to poison them
so you won't starve so you're not going
to die this week but I guarantee you
your 60s aren't going to work out well
for you because you've been eating
poison for 60 years
I feel like that's a conscious choice
that we we couldn't grow enough food
without making it unhealthy so we choose
unhealthy food and go well it's best we
can do
grow your own
so I've been doing an experiment with my
own health
when I can which is harder than you
think I'm trying to go a full day
with only eating things that don't have
preservatives and weird stuff on it you
know so I'll add some butter to some
broccoli but I won't go crazy beyond
that
and I feel completely better
like I feel that when I eat clean I
actually feel better and it feels it
feels immediate
it doesn't feel like I don't know you
know in general maybe those days were
better now it feels like today I
actually feel better
because I've been doing this lately
especially
and when I look at any kind of packaging
that's got you know this full paragraph
of chemicals in it if I avoid those the
ones have like the full paragraph of
chemicals
you know my my nasal passages don't clog
up I I don't get inflammation like it
doesn't hurt to stand up I mean just
basic pain of life goes away
if I just eat clean for two days
basically
try it so here's a recommendation
I know that you would not enjoy the food
if you tried this this because it'd be
like you know eat a lean steak and have
some vegetables with you know little or
nothing on them maybe a little butter or
Pepper or something right
and just try it for two days
try for two days eating nothing that has
a paragraph of additives
and feel feel if you feel different
I believe you will
I believe you will
so no no fast food no nothing from a can
or a processed box just like if you can
hold the broccoli in your hand and get
organic right now I don't think the
pesticides give you any immediate bad
feeling I just worry about them in long
term sort of a cumulative thing but the
the additives
the additives I believe immediately make
you feel bad I believe they immediately
make you feel bad as in the same day
the sulfites are yeah my big problem
sulfites
or or just my my nemesis
yeah and by the way did you know the
sulfites are not always listed in the in
the ingredients there's some kind of law
that allows them to not list it it's one
of those
it's the thing I'm allergic to and they
don't have to list it
so
how happy am I about that
I think I'm right about that I need to
fact check on that but I think I'm right
all right
um
now that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to the conclusion of my
prepared remarks
um I like to think we're doing important
work here
what do you think important work
let me ask you a question
because I have to maybe I've asked this
before so it's going to sound like I'm
asking for a compliment or something I'm
not I'm actually I'm curious about this
and I'm more curious what the YouTube
people say because the the locals people
are going to get the right answer
because they know me better but the
YouTube viewers probably they're more
new people in this stream than normal
how many of you on YouTube
would say that um I have an influence on
National political events
that I personally have an influence on
National political events yes or no
all right so I'll let you know on locals
locals everybody's saying yes and you're
you're correct you are correct
um I thought there'd be more of a
mixture on YouTube but if you think the
answer is no
ask yourself why so many people are
saying yes
right
yeah
um
now
to my point about whether I was canceled
for political reasons
right
now keep in mind that nobody on the
political right canceled me or believes
that I should have been canceled I think
none
on the political left it was pretty much
Universal I should be canceled
knowing that I influence politics
do you think the cancellation was
political
do you think it was political
having just answered that I moved the
the needle on politics
yeah
yeah yes now
was that obvious on the in the fog of
War on the day that I was canceled was
it obvious to you that it was a
political move and it wasn't so much
about anybody's outrage was that obvious
to you locals people say yes
YouTube is a little mixed some people
are saying no but now it's obvious isn't
it would you agree it's obvious now
and I would say the the best evidence of
that is that black conservatives didn't
have a problem
yeah they had a reaction
and some curiosity and that's all
perfectly appropriate but when they
heard the context they're like okay that
makes sense
yeah so if you believe that this was
because I said something outrageous and
that's why I got canceled
that's actually fake news
that is actually fake news
it is yet again another prominent
example
of a you know basically a hoax you know
I don't want to call it a hoax because
that implies some kind of intention
but with or without attention and and I
would also say regardless of what the
thought process was of the people who
canceled me
it's still political
because they wouldn't have made the
decision if I were black or a Democrat
everybody knows that
every one of you knows that if I'd been
black or just a Democrat I wouldn't have
been canceled of course not of course
not it is a hundred percent political
which doesn't mean it wasn't offensive
because remember I did it to be
offensive to attract attention to what I
thought would be a useful point and
still will do that by the way it still
will be useful
I just have to you know clean up some
things on prisoner Island first
progress is good by the way progress is
good
now do you think that I've already moved
the battleship of opinion because do you
think on day one I could have gotten
most of the people on YouTube to say
yeah it's obviously political no there's
no way to do it on day one if I'd said
that on day one you would have laughed
at me you would have laughed
you would have absolutely laughed yeah
oh yeah so it's political I got it I I
got it it's totally political
you would have mocked me mercilessly but
once the fog of War clears and you can
see that it lined up completely
politically it didn't even line up by
race
of all things the opinions did not line
up by race
it was only by politics it was all
political from the beginning
all right
um
John says I think the battleship is sunk
John
you have no faith in me
this isn't the first time I've been
canceled it's the fourth or fifth
I'm more canceled than I have so much uh
practice getting canceled for my uh for
my gender and my race it's the fourth
time
two corporate jobs
one TV show because they decided to have
a black only night and they canceled
mine
and then this
four cancellations that would not have
happened if I'd been black
that's just a fact
there's four cancellations two careers
no three careers four careers I've lost
four careers
for not being black
being female would have helped a little
bit but being black would have really
helped
now
do you believe that do you believe those
claims by the way do you believe my
claim that I really was told by my
bosses directly you can't be promoted
here
because you're white yeah anybody who is
white and lived through the 80s and 90s
you all know it's true every one of you
knows it's true because it happened to
you right somehow black American never
heard of this
which always amazes me which has nothing
to do with black America you know there
are just as many things that black
Americans know that I don't know so it's
just it's more about the bubble
but it there's a prominent uh
journalist I think Chicago paper who has
he kept bothering me online because he
thought my claims of being discriminated
against for being white and male in my
corporate jobs he said I was making it
up and that I couldn't you know he
wanted proof
and I kept saying you need proof from
one person
you could literally drive to San
Francisco
flag down any any white guy in his 50s
and say hey were you working here in the
80s and 90s yes I was
were white people and white men in
particular discriminated against like
directly in direct language or not
what would every 50 year old white guy
who lives through that time tell you oh
yeah massively yeah it might not have
happened to that one person
but they would all know that happened to
their brother their cousin their father
or their mother not their mother but
every 100 of them so I'm thinking how
can a journalist
and and then here's where Detroit the
trail died
since I was unwilling to produce the the
names and identities of my two bosses
from the 80s and 90s
both of whom are likely to no longer be
with us because they're I think they
were both older than me so yeah they'd
be in their 70s
and you know certainly retired by now
and I'm not going to drag them
because I like both of those bosses I'm
not going to drag them through this
like like the last thing they want to do
is be contacted by the press to fact
check this right so I decided not to I
said that I could but then when I
thought about is like that'd be kind of
a crappy thing to do to them so I don't
want to do it and I thought it would be
good enough to say literally ask anybody
you don't need me just ask anybody and
you'll get the same answer anybody who's
white and male and lives at that time
and he wasn't willing to do it
and so I just tweeted hey did it happen
to you and you know hundreds of people
say oh yeah it happened to me like
doesn't have any impact people are
pretty locked into their beliefs
so anyway
um
I'm gonna say goodbye to YouTube for
tomorrow for tonight I'll see you
tomorrow thanks for joining best live
stream ever
