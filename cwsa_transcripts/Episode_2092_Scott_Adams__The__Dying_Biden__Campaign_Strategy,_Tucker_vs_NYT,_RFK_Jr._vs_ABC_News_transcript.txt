do do
good morning ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to the highlight of civilization
so far
today is the well probably one of the
most special days you've had since
yesterday at least and if you'd like to
take that up to levels that nobody's
ever ever experienced the history of
civilization all you need is a cup of
mugger a glass of Tankard chalice or
Stein a canteen jug or flask of SNL of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens
no
ah
so good
well there are all kinds of things
happening
some of them are good should I start
with the good news
I hear some good news
uh Greenpeace of Finland so the Finland
version of Greenpeace is no longer going
to protest nuclear power
uh
uh
uh they're not so Greenpeace in Finland
no longer against nuclear energy
that maybe
30 years too late
and I asked myself
is it a little bit embarrassing to be in
Greenpeace imagine you've been in
Greenpeace and you've been fighting for
decades to prevent nuclear power
and you woke up one day and you realized
that you were personally responsible for
climate change
because the climate change problem
you know arguably even the war in
Ukraine
it's because of Greenpeace is that too
far do you think there would be a war in
Ukraine if if we had abundant nuclear
energy all over Europe
I don't know I think they'd be driving
electric cars and laughing at Russia by
now
seems to me
am I wrong that Greenpeace is
responsible for climate change
is that is that a over interpretation
because I think they were their primary
group against nuclear power
and being against nuclear power for the
last several decades is exactly the
reason
that we don't have enough energy that's
clean
I mean I think that they're primarily
responsible for climate change
that's what it looks like to me
anyway it must be awkward to wake up one
day and realize the thing you've been
fighting for
to fix for 20 years you had made much
much worse
not a little bit much much much much
worse
good job there Greenpeace
well more good news Wall Street Journal
is reporting there are now a few
different Technologies for removing
these so-called
forever chemicals from our water supply
I guess it's really hard to filter out
all the little micro chemicals that last
forever in our water supply usually
stuff from pollution
dumping
but apparently they have at least two
new technologies one has to do with high
pressure and one has to do with some
electrical process but
neither of them are yet
fully economical
however when you're talking about Safe
Water
well you're probably willing to pay a
little to get that so I got a feeling
that it will be economical because
people would pay a very high price for
clean water
so that's good news there might be a
weigh-in of our uh drinking chemicals
all the time problem
uh not right away not right away
all right and now a demonstration of the
wisdom of my audience give me the answer
before I ask the question
answered before that's right that's
right
that is the correct answer the people on
the locals platform are at YouTube is
catching up the correct answer is 25
that is a correct answer would you like
to hear the question
I I don't know maybe you'd like to hear
the question you all got the answer
right which is amazing
but uh what percentage of American high
school high school students identify as
lgbtq
25 percent
yep
25 percent
which is a coincidence really
because it's not like there's a
years-long pattern of 25 being
sort of an almost magical number
it's not like that ever happened nothing
like that this is just a coincidence
people 25 the fact that my entire
audience could guess the answer before I
asked the question
doesn't mean anything do not make any
conclusions from that
so yeah that was a CDC estimate 25
percent
do you know what I think about that
I hate to tell you this I'm going to
give you the California opinion of that
25 percent
are you ready for this
it's low
it's way low
sorry
and when I say it's low here's what I'm
talking about
I'm almost positive it's higher in
California
almost positive
especially the bisexual part
because among female
high school students bisexuality is so
normalized
among the women
that I don't know I think it's close in
half
probably something like half of the
female students in California would say
you know it just depends who I fall in
love with
it's actually
it's not the worst thing in the world
right if you think the world's falling
apart or whatever the the fact that
there are uh a normal high school female
completely just average person would
answer the question this way depends who
I fall in love with
I don't know is that worse is that is
that a sign of is that a sign of things
getting worse or better
it's a little unclear isn't it I don't
know
on one hand you have to uh
yeah you have to appreciate the
open-mindedness
but could it be too far
could it be too far that's the question
so I think it's higher in California and
California tends to be predictive of
where the country is going on these
social trends would you agree with that
would you agree that Californians a few
years ahead
of at least the middle of the country
you don't believe that
I think there's plenty of precedent
where things started in California or
maybe New York and spread toward the
middle no all right well I guess we I
guess we don't agree on that
All Right Moving On
um
so do you think that's a tick tock thing
how much of the 25 percent of high
school students being lgbtq do you think
is literally just tick tock
do you think it could be measured
do you think if you could measure
the the kids who spend time on tick tock
versus the kids who don't do you think
if you asked the percentage of lgbtq in
both groups you get the same number
I doubt it
I doubt it so we now have a very clean
way
I think I mean you wouldn't want to
believe the first study you saw in it
you'd want to see if it could be
repeated in different forms but I'll bet
we can now measure exactly how much Tick
Tock changes the sexual preferences of
American Youth Am I Wrong do we not have
now all the data we would need if
somebody were to do that study the data
is all available you just say do you
watch Tick Tock do you identify as lgbtq
we're done so do you think you'll ever
see that study
do you think anybody will do that very
obvious important study very very
obvious important study nope nope I'll
bet you won't do you know why
because because whoever the uh
whoever does that study will be banned
for life from a whole polite company
because they will be
if you found that Tick Tock was
influencing people's sexual
identification and preferences
it would look like you're saying
that those are not real
oh you know what I mean so if you said
yes you know the the core there's a core
of it that's real
but then Tick Tock is causing this this
extra number of people who might have
been in the gray area some way is
causing them to you know commit to
something they might not have committed
to
do you think that you could do that
study and get it funded and then publish
it and the mainstream media would say
hey look at this there's a bunch of
people who think they're
lgbtq but probably wouldn't think that
at all unless they use tick tock
nope I don't believe there's any way to
do that study
try to try to hold in your mind there's
sort of a theme for today
so here's today's theme
it's sort of that slow boiling frog
situation
that things get weird a little bit and
you go oh that's weird but it's just a
little bit
it's not like you're going to spend your
day thinking about it and then the next
day it's it's twice as weird
and you go well look at that it doubled
but it was doubling from you know a
little small number so it's still not
that weird and then it gets a little bit
weirder
and we've reached a point where the
weirdness is so extreme
but we don't feel it or talk about it or
act like it's extreme because we got
used to it it just sort of snuck up on
us a little bit at a time
all right so the fact that tick tock is
reprogramming the sexuality of Americans
and we're not doing anything about it I
mean in all likelihood at the very least
we should have studied it right so I
don't want to get ahead to the science
but I think it's obvious I mean I don't
really even need a study to know what's
happening
uh but I could be wrong I still want to
study you know maybe maybe I'm wrong
never know but
it just sort of snuck up on us didn't it
if this had just come out of nowhere
let's say tick tock had never existed
and and it just suddenly appeared and at
the same time all the polls like
suddenly went to 25
lgbtq in high school what if they both
happened like Suddenly at the same time
would we put up with it
no no if it happens suddenly we'd say my
God that's the worst thing in the world
they're reprogramming the like the
biological impulses of our humans
they're going to stop reproducing
of course we would have stopped it
immediately but because Tick Tock sort
of you know slowly caught on
and then this this other numbers you
know kind of grew slowly to where it is
we got used to it
no problem nothing to do here nothing to
see at all
that's the theme for today they'll see
you'll see more of it
um
Rasmussen did a poll on the popularity
of Tucker Carlson 59 of us likely U.S
voters have a favorable impression of
them
59 percent
um
I'm going to ask you another question
but before I ask you I'd like you to
give me the answer
let's see if you can do it twice in a
row
oh you did it again
amazing yeah the answer is 25 you
haven't even heard the question that's
twice now those of you who are new to
this live stream are you impressed
they're actually guessing the answer
precisely
before they've heard the question and
they're going to do it a second time in
a row watch this
according to Rasmussen what percentage
of public have a very unfavorable
impression of Tucker Carlson
25 percent
all right in another story
by the way I guess this video got over
like 57 million
how would you like to be a member of the
mainstream press
all right you're a member of the
mainstream press and Tucker Carlson does
a little whatever two minute video
in which he doesn't even make news
there's nothing specific on it that
would make news
and he got over 50 million views because
people are so interested in what Tucker
Carlson has to say
75 million hits
somebody says
maybe it's more by now but do you think
mainstream media is a little bit worried
about how popular he is
I'd be worried
so I still think he's going to do some
kind of a debatey kind of a format but
we'll see
um
here's some news in my life
yesterday I registered to vote
I know it's a pretty big thing isn't it
so I I normally say that I don't vote
because I don't want to be influenced by
my team
but events have caused me to register to
vote so I'm a registered Democrat now
but you didn't see that coming
I'm also black according to my
self-identification but I'm a black
Democrat now I registered yesterday now
can you uh
can you guess I know that the people on
locals they already got a preview I did
a man cave episode last night that's
available only to subscribers
and so they already know the answer but
I want to see if YouTube can guess why I
registered as Democrat
can you guess I I know the locals people
some of you know
why did I register as Democrat
uh some say it so I could vote in the
primary and support JFK Jr
that's uh one thing I might do that's
that's a possible thing I would do but
that's not the reason
why fentanyl no not specifically my my
identification with a party
is unrelated to who I would support for
an office or who I would what what
policies so my my party identification
is not related to a policy preference or
a candidate preference although it would
give me the ability to maybe help give
Biden some competition in the primaries
but that's not the reason
is it because they hunt Republicans
you're close
so you don't get targeted close I mean
that's part of it
you don't want to be called the white
supremacist not quite
that's not quite there I mean I don't
like that but that's not quite the
reason you're so close let me tell you
the reason
it was only Democrats who decided that
I'm a racist
it wasn't Republicans
so since Democrats have decided that I'm
a racist
I've decided to join their Club
so that all the races are in the same
place and the next time they talk about
me and they do a big story and they say
this damn racist and look at his
political opinions
oh he's a Democrat
I want every time they call me a racist
they'll have to publish that I'm a
registered Democrat
I thought it was funny
and if it entertained me that's good
enough
so yes if you call me a racist I'm going
to register Democrat and I'm going to be
a proud proud racist Democrat
I feel at home with my people this way
all right uh and then I also registered
uh I identified started identifying as
black again uh I used to but I'm
identifying as black again just in case
there ever any
um favoritism I just want to be well
situated because sometimes they'll say
well you know maybe you should have been
identifying this way for a long time
otherwise we're not going to give you
any benefits so I want to make sure I
got a good track record
all right
um
Nikki Haley is saying out loud what
everybody's thinking that Biden likely
won't make it to the end of his second
term
that he literally won't survive
Peggy Newton was writing something on
along the same lines today in the Wall
Street Journal and of course other
people van Jones mentioned it on CNN
that really it's like voting for for a
Kamala now remember my theme
my theme is that things started out
weird
but because it was just a little weird
you let it go and then it just kept
getting weirder until here we are all
right so here's the progression
we we collectively the United States
elected a very very old president
which I thought was a little weird right
it was he's definitely older than the
optimum age but it was a special case
and it was all about beating Trump and
blah blah blah
all right so time goes by and we got
used to that weirdness which was pretty
weird pretty weird that they would run
somebody that old just to try to get
that win
but now we've actually reached the point
where I can say this it is not a joke
this is actually what's happening
the Democrat strategy for winning
is to run a guy who's going to die in
office
now if I'd said that on the first day
of his you know first campaign look they
got a long-term strategy that involves
Joe Biden dying in office
you would have said well that's crazy
Scott but we're actually
literally no hyperbole
their strategy is to run a guy they
expect to die in office
that's a real thing
and we're just like talking about it
like it's ordinary and let's see the
the Democrat strategy is what I'll call
the Diane Biden strategy
so they went from the Haydn Biden
because they needed to hide him because
it was too embarrassing to be in public
so they went from hide and by him to die
in Biden
do you know why we didn't care so much
we again collectively the voters of the
country they didn't care so much that
Biden couldn't put two words together
because they didn't see him
they just they just hit him
and now you're concerned that he's
basically on the edge of death so they
changed their strategy to well we're not
going to say it out loud but obviously
he's going to die
obviously you know the odds are he's not
going to make it all the way to the end
so really it's about Kamala
and somehow
somehow we've normalized the idea that
one team can run a guy who's going to
die in office and here's the best part
the guy that they expect to die in
office
they also think has the best chance of
beating Trump
that was the best they could do so if
all the 70 80 80 I guess 80 million
Democratic voters
let's say uh let's say 50 million of
them were over the age that they could
run for president
so they had 50 million choices and they
picked a guy who's a notorious liar has
strange International connections that
look sketchy through Hunter Biden and it
will probably die in office and that and
he's their who's their Champion that was
the best they could do
and how would you like to be Trump and
to know that the odds are he might be
you
the Dead Guy
you're going to get beaten by a dead guy
and probably
now
now one advantage that Biden would have
is that if you're somebody who's
definitely going to die in office or
people think that's the likely case
there's one group that you're going to
get a lot more support from him all
right
people who were already dead
because people are already dead they're
going to identify with this you know
dead candidate thing so I think Biden's
going to get all of the votes from the
dead people
like usual
all right man I'm just joking come on uh
come on I'm just joking with you
dumpy yeah dead people don't vote
much
um so it's a Diane Biden strategy let's
see if we can make that thing make that
a thing Diane Biden
all right I told you the other day and
uh I think nearly a hundred percent of
you disagreed
and now I have some people agreeing with
me so I'm going to circle back here's
what I said
DeSantis picking a fight with Disney is
bad politics for DeSantis
and people disagreed because they knew
the details right if you knew the
details you'd say well wait a minute
Disney some did something they shouldn't
have done you know they got into
politics
DeSantis slapped him down I love it
right don't you love that Disney went
awoke this sentence and tried to get
into the business of the government and
then DeSantis slapped him down
you love that don't you now that's what
you would say if you were a Republican
and
you knew the situation well like you'd
followed the story how many people how
many people do you think that fits
I mean do you really think that the
public of the United States is following
the DeSantis Disney story
of all the stories in the country do you
really think yeah 25 percent
I see I see you uh do you really think
that the non-news watching public has
any idea what that's about of course not
now the only thing that they're going to
hear is that DeSantis is mad at Disney
and vice versa
what is more popular in this world
Disney or DeSantis
no contest Disney is way more popular
than DeSantis so the only thing that
people are going to hear
is that DeSantis who should be the
serious governor doing serious things
has picked a fight with Mickey Mouse and
he might be losing he's not even winning
it at the moment because they're suing
him and who knows what's going to happen
so
and then it got worse or it got worse
he's in Israel right now
so when people are saying uh wait a
minute the reason we liked him is that
he was doing his Governor job really
well
so you know he just stuck to his
knitting so to speak and we liked that
he was just a good Governor well what's
he doing in Israel
now allegedly it's part of his you know
uh international trade that of course
Governors do do they
do they is he signing a lot of
international deals where he's over
there I don't think so to me it looks
like he's running for president and he's
spending time in Israel while Florida is
sitting there marinating in a lack of
leadership while he's gone I mean that's
what it looks like
so
so to me I thought it was was a huge
political disadvantage for Descendants
but almost all of you disagreed with me
however
backing my side is that in the hill I
think it was the hill that uh quote
whispers are growing louder among
Republicans among Republicans
that uh DeSantis has miscalculated in
his battle with Disney
um there are real dangers they say of
his fight with the corporation becoming
a distraction from his likely
presidential campaign and one that could
make him wait for it one that can make
him seem
Petty and vindictive rather than strong
and decisive that's it that's my point
so if it makes you feel any better
according to one report the Republicans
who know how things work are now
completely agreeing with me that he's
looking Petty and vindictive rather than
strong and decisive now what's the
reality
what's the reality well the reality is
he was probably strong and decisive
would you agree
the reality
is that he was strong and decisive
he pushed against somebody that people
don't usually push against he was very
decisive and it was strong because you
know it was a very a very clear and
strong reaction
so those of you who are saying Buzz
Scott
the truth is it was strong and decisive
it was
I know that
has nothing to do with my point if
you're fighting with Mickey Mouse you're
 losing
that's my whole argument if you're
fighting with Mickey Mouse you're losing
you don't give me your details don't
tell me how strong he is don't tell me
how right he is don't tell me how good
it is for the system I agree with all of
that I call I completely agree with that
it's just that fighting with Mickey
Mouse cannot win it cannot win
all right point eight
all right
as you know I've been promoting the idea
that I'd love to see a debate between
RFK Jr and uh Vivek ramaswamy now the
reason I want to say it is that neither
them at the moment
you know look like they're going to be
the nominee but a lot of us think
that they have the qualities we would
look for in the president on either side
and maybe more qualities than the two
people who are likely to be the nominees
so if you want to put a dent in the
possibility that the likely nominees or
the inevitable nominees we needed we
need a debate of the two people who were
the I would say the most
um the most impressive
possibilities for both sides most
impressive now remember RFK Juniors
already he got 19 in a recent poll
which is a lot for somebody who just
jumped in and people don't quite know
him specifically they know his family
name of course now a lot of that I think
is
probably anti-bitant they just somebody
younger would be nice yeah it'll be 25
soon
um
but when I tweeted about it I got 1.3
million views so far this morning now
for context for me to tweeze something
that gets over a million views
that means that people are really
digging it right that's a strong strong
signal that this is a popular idea now
it doesn't need to be popular with
everybody in the country
but if you've got uh 1.3 million people
willing to you know look at this tweet
and a lot of people retweet it Etc there
is a there is a real strong desire for
it now here's the fun part
normally this would Pro you know I think
in a normal year this wouldn't be a
practical idea
because people wouldn't want to upset
the apple cart of who's of who the top
candidates are you know the Republicans
would say oh leave us alone let you know
let Trump be Trump and the Democrats
were in a normal year I would say let
Biden be Biden but because of the
extraordinary situation about both of
these candidates
I think people would take seriously the
you know the challenge or debate now
here's the other thing that's fun both
RFK Jr and Vivek have a quality in
common
that I love
and it's that they're willing to talk to
people who disagree with them in the
media so both of them will go on you
know Vivek has been on CNN and RFK Jr
has been on Fox and they've both been on
all kinds of podcasts that are all over
the board
so
they're probably the only two people
who would be in that position at the
same time who would actually be willing
to talk to anybody who gave them the
right platform you know independent of a
party that's a really really strong
uh characteristic or or ethical stand
for both of them which I respect
the other thing that's completely
different about this cycle is that
podcasters are the primary movers of
opinion
I think that's true
would you agree now it could be that I'm
too far into the bubble but I think that
you know maybe it's not maybe it's not
primary yet but it's a really really big
part you know it might still be 40 60
with 60 being the major media but
but podcasters are you know a real
legitimate power and many of them have
huge audiences that Megan Kelly's the
Joe Rogan's the you know you can name a
lot of them so it seems to me that given
the popularity of the idea and the fact
that podcasters love big audiences and
both of the candidates would like more
attention nothing would get more
attention than the two of them debating
am I right
if the two of them had a debate on just
a a well-established
uh yeah Dr Drew would be good lots of
podcasts would be great for this
um
you just don't you think this would be
good for both of them
because they're they're both battling
their own party at the moment
so they just have to look good
to their own party
that would be a real strong play so I
don't think there's any way that RFK Jr
or Vivek could lose by debating each
other because the way debates go is
everybody just thinks that the one you
know the one from their party one
so it's going to look like both of them
won
to each of their own parties
so they're not going to hurt like
they're both so clever that they're not
going to embarrass themselves in a
debate it's going to look good for both
of them
and that's what they both need
yeah sticks and Hammer you'd be
interesting yeah
all right so I think now we wait because
I would be very very surprised if
they're not already invitations out from
major podcasters who know what would be
the biggest audience they ever had right
if you're a podcaster and you're right
for this
to host that kind of debate you will
never get a bigger audience than that
would bring you am I right
that would be the biggest audience that
any podcaster ever had you know maybe
Joe Rogan's suspect special case or
something
but there's no way that that wouldn't be
anything but a win for everybody
involved so I think it's going to happen
all right uh speaking of RFK Jr so he
does an interview on ABC News
and at the end of the interview I saw
this in a Scott morefield tweet at the
end ABC said they admitted that they
they deleted
or censored extended portions related to
discussions around the coven vaccines
what
they interviewed it they interviewed a
candidate for president
and then they decided that a major part
of what he said which is really
pretty key to his entire existence
that they would just delete it
and then they told you they deleted it
what
now I think the answer is because they
believe it's misinformation
uh that doesn't work anymore
if he were just abundant
you you could argue well I was still I
would still be opposed to it the
censorship but you could argue with at
least that makes sense you're trying to
save the world or something at least
you'd have an argument what is the
argument for censoring a presidential
candidate who's polling at 19 percent
and a primary
I can't think of one can you think of
any legitimate reason for censoring that
yeah now if you were an expert and they
thought he was just wrong Maybe
others need to hear everything he says
that the voters don't need to hear just
the part of the ABC things you need to
hear need to hear it all
now again
how in the world do we settle for this
it's because things got a little weird
during the pandemic
and then they just kept getting weirder
until we're that point where ABC News
can get on the air and tell you to your
face that they decided what information
from a major candidate for the
presidency you would say
and they thought that they could say
that in public and you'd say oh good for
you it's a good thing you edited about
that dangerous stuff so I didn't hear it
like how is that okay it's only okay
because again we started a little bit
weird and it just sort of kept getting
weirder and then we got used to it
that is so not okay that's not even
that's not even in the right zip code of
being okay
and and they did it like there was
nothing to even be embarrassed about
that's how far things have come
all right um
I have a special request to all of you
please I beg of you
do not ask me what I think of a
potential presidential ticket that would
include a mixture of a Republican and a
Democrat please don't ask me that again
there is no chance of that happening
it's zero I'm not going to entertain it
it would be like well what if the moon
crashed into the Earth Scott can you
give us an opinion on that it's not
going to happen
it's not going to happen
ever
so every time you ask me that question
because I'm getting it I'm getting it in
DMS I'm getting it in in my email I'm
getting it by text
everybody's asking me well what if Trump
ran with RFK Jr what about that no
it doesn't matter if it's a good idea
it doesn't matter if it's a bad idea the
only thing that matters is it's not
going to happen
that's all it's just not going to happen
so I can't answer that question
all right
um
I'm trying to figure out how to handle
this Stephen Crowder Candace Owens
divorce situation
like I feel like I want to avoid it but
everybody who had that same Instinct has
sort of waited in already I I don't want
to be the the last person in the world
who didn't say something about it so I'm
going to say something generic
so Stephen Crowder there's a video going
around I don't know how anybody got it
that shows a private conversation
between a husband and wife captured on
their own ring doorbell
now how somebody got that probably from
her lawyer or something I don't know
maybe but
I give you this warning
if you watch the video and that's the
only information you had you would
conclude that Stephen Crowder is the
worst husband and maybe a terrible
terrible person
would you all agree with that if that's
all you saw it looks really bad like
really really bad
however I give you this one context
we've been fooled by hoaxes exactly this
way
where you see the video and you say
there's only one interpretation remember
the Covington kids when I went on to
when I went on live stream and said well
there's only one way to see this this
kid is bad I mean this kid's a bad kid
and then it was totally wrong
completely opposite
he was a good kid and didn't do anything
except stand there that was it
and yet he looked like the bad guy
because of the way the video only shows
one side
likewise of course with the drinking
bleach hoax and the fine people hoax Etc
so
do you believe do you believe that
there's absolutely nothing
that the wife could have done that would
make you say
oh that changes everything
I can't
I can't think of anything that would
make me change my mind about the
situation does that mean hold on does
that mean that no such thing exists
it really doesn't
it doesn't mean that you understand the
situation just because you can't think
of any other way to interpret it and I
can't I can't think of any other way to
interpret it like I've racked my brains
tried to say all right how could this be
okay in my wildest imagination and I
can't come up with anything but remember
I also couldn't come up with anything
with the Covington kids Oaks the fact
that you can't even imagine
something that would change your mind
about this situation doesn't mean it
doesn't exist
and it's also none of our business
and I just feel bad for them I just feel
bad for both of them right so I'm not
going to speculate
what it might be that you don't know
that could change your opinion on things
Etc but
I will just put this thought into your
mind
they probably knew each other before
they got married
am I right
do you think that the wife was just like
suddenly surprised
that he's controlling
I don't know that she was suddenly
surprised
so the question I'd have to ask is
did one of them change the nature of the
relationship
with sort of a bait and switch
I'm not I'm not alleging that that would
be a shitty thing to do I'm not alleging
that
but suppose use your imagination
suppose they had a relationship where
she actually explicitly said yeah I want
you to be in charge and I want you to be
in charge at this level
at this exact level that you saw where
he would tell her she couldn't drive a
car
you know he would tell her what she's
doing wrong
is it possible
that she knew exactly what she was
getting
and explicitly agreed to it
is it possible
what do you think
there's so many things possible
but let me say again if the only thing
we know is what's on the video there's
no there's no defending him right
looks pretty bad
but what you don't know is what was the
nature of their explicit agreement
before they got married about how they
would treat each other and did it change
one of them baited and switched wouldn't
you agree
one of them baited and switched because
when they got married they thought hey
you're great hey you're great too let's
get married
obviously they obviously thought each
other were great when they got married
so if they don't think each other is the
same person that they married which one
changed do you think this Stephen
Crowder just became that guy lately
pretty unlikely
do you think that he ever revealed his
true nature before you know before she
would read to marry him
I don't know that's actually a good
question
do you think that she ever presented
herself as okay with a certain situation
and then once she was married
said well I thought I'd be okay with
this but turns out I'm not
yeah
don't know
so I don't think he can be defended
would you agree with that
that you can't you can't be defended
based on what we've seen but I only
caution you that you don't know the
whole story
and you couldn't it's not even possible
so
I I can't defend him but I can tell you
you don't know the whole story for
whatever that's worth
I'd like to say that about everybody
um I'm not I'm not even a fan I mean I'm
not a big Crowder fan I think he's been
entertaining sometimes but I'm not I
don't follow him or anything but I do
think that uh just like uh the Tate
brothers and just like anybody else
who's not my
first choice of people to hang out with
um I think he deserves the benefit of a
doubt
no matter how hard that is and it's
really hard it's really hard
all right
uh here's a story about Chinese solar
panel tariffs
okay I'll wake up to do this story
apparently it's important
so Biden wants to wave some tariffs so
that I guess we can get more Chinese
solar panels at a cheaper price
and you know that's part of his I'm sure
part of his climate initiatives
and then there are some people who want
to reverse that
and that would include some Senate
Democrats
but here's what I had trouble with the
story
um they want a 24-month pause some of
the some of the people in Congress on
the enforcement so it's a pause on the
enforcement of solar panels
anti-circumvention tariffs
okay so anti
means opposite
so anti-circumvention but circumvention
is also the opposite of something
so you circumvent
which is the opposite of doing the thing
so if your anti-circumventing
okay so your anti-circumventing is what
you want to do but they want to some of
the people want to pause
so that would be stopping the anti
so you're not anti
the circumvention which is reversing
just give us our goddamn solar panels
I can't read this story
it's too complicated
but I think we need some solar panels
all right
um
Alan dershowitz just keeps saying things
that I agree with so of course you know
he's famously votes Democrat but he's
willing to defend anybody whose civil
liberties have been
abused and he says quote not the
American civil liberties unions not the
usual people in the uh in the academy
not the New York Times not any of the
liberal establishment the lawyer
continued are are basically defending
civil
civil liberties
and for me as a liberal as a person who
just defended the rights of liberals for
60 years of my life the idea that they
meaning the Liberals are now turning
into mccarthyites is so disappointing
I feel like dershowitz is feeling like
Green Peace and Finland
uh I just spent Decades of my life
fighting for something that
I don't like how this turned out
so dershowitz defends liberals forever
you know defending their civil liberties
and then ends up finding out that
they're the very people who didn't lie
denying civil liberties to others
ouch
anyway
the New York Times is trying to take out
Tucker because he apparently when you
try to kill the king you better get it
right the first time because the king is
coming for you and Tucker of course is a
huge critic of the New York Times
so do you think that the New York Times
had an ethical obligation in their
reporting about Tucker Carlson did they
have an ethical obligation to note that
he is one of their biggest critics
do you think that was in the story
do you think the New York Times said
here's a story about our biggest critic
who continually accuses of fake news and
has used the following examples of where
we actually did report fake news and so
he's always pointing out our fake news
but when we tell you things about him
you should totally believe it
that's that's what again
how weird is that
literally the biggest critic of the New
York Times in terms of you know
provenance the biggest one and they
don't even mention
that's not part of the story
how is that not the most important part
of the story
to me that's number one that's that's
sentence one
our biggest critic
who is often accused us of fake news for
example there was a time we reported you
know that the uh there were weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq and he he also
got on us for the Russia collusion hoax
and also the fighting people Hooks and
the other hoaxes
how's that not the first paragraph
because if you don't know that the New
York Times and Tucker are mortal enemies
and that Tucker Carlson is one of the
most existential risks to the business
model of the New York Times if you
didn't know that how do you understand
the story they tell about them
here are some of the terrible things
that he is alleged to have done by
according to the laws the person
bringing the lawsuit about all the
rampant sexism all right
um
he once referred
to his older female fans as
post-menopausal
women
so he once referred to older women as
post-menopausal which is very sexist
isn't it
wait a minute
well who what kind of women are
post-menopausal
is it the young ones
isn't older women and post-menopausal
kind of similar
so
that made it a
an unfriendly work environment
because he noted that biologically
women become post-menopausal after some
age
what
well surely there are much stronger ones
all right so that's the weakest one if
that were the only complaint I don't
think there'd be any issue right if that
were the only complaint but there are
some big ones are you ready for this
here's some big ones
uh he once referred to and I can barely
say this out loud it's so terrible
he once referred to a woman as
just so hard for me to say this and this
is not me talking because I would never
use this word but he allegedly once
referred to a woman as
yummy
yummy
how can he keep his job
well I it's a good thing they got rid of
him
because you know that's something that
no man has ever said about a woman
I I lived a long time have you ever
heard of man
comment on the attractiveness of a woman
has that happened in your experience
what oh some people say they've seen
that oh you've seen that now I've never
seen that before I've never seen a woman
comment
on the attractiveness or a man comments
in the attractiveness of what's so
strange
you still at a restaurant
where most of the front of house staff
or women
but there was one exception that we had
a bartender
uh and that bartender was unusually good
looking
do you know how many times
the female employees
said something about him while I was
present
this was a typical conversation from the
female employees of my own company
oh my god do you see him oh my God
all the time
all day long they would talk about how
hot he was all day long
couldn't you couldn't get away from it
was he gay no he was very not gay
all right so but that's not the only
thing apparently Tucker used the c word
when referring to Sydney Powell
wow
wow so that's sexist
so I'm sure it had nothing to do with
the fact
that she embarrassed the entire
Republican party and changed politics in
the United States by believing the
Kraken
and that
even at the point when it was clear that
she didn't have the goods
she still you know LED Fox News and
Tucker and others you know along the
until eventually he just disavowed her
basically by saying that she had no
evidence for her claims
so
um how many of you are offended by him
using the c word about one specific
person Sydney Powell for this specific
set of events
is anybody offended by that
no I thought the word was well chosen
I I thought that word so that's the
strongest word right
it's the strongest
word and I think the situation called
for the strongest word
now he didn't say it he didn't say it on
TV
he wasn't screaming I believe it was in
the email right it was in a private
email
um would anybody like to confess that
they've ever used the c word
about a male or female in a private
context
anybody
have any of you ever used that word
maybe maybe
do you know what words are allowed
privately
what would be an example of an
inappropriate word that somebody's using
privately to someone who doesn't mind
that word
what would be an example of that
nothing
nothing there's no such thing as an
offensive word spoken privately to
someone who's not offended by the word
that's not a thing that's like it
literally made up
in order for this to be offensive you
have to take it out of its original
context which is two people talking
privately
and they have to move it into the public
context and then imagine if it happened
there oh imagine if he'd said this in
front of other women and oh that's
terrible but that didn't happen
the entire offense is an imaginary
offense where you have to change it from
two people privately talking or bothered
a bit
to some imaginary context where it was
other people here again
otherwise it's nothing
it's nothing
but so they got that but that's not the
only thing hold on hold on
apparently people who are not Tucker
Carlson also said things
so I mean Tucker Carlson is bad because
people who worked for him
when he wasn't there
would say terrible things too
so this is something that some of the
men must have said I assume in men about
some female guests
they actually talked about which of them
were more effible
but they use the f word
now
that's something that people don't ever
do
now I would agree if you're having that
conversation in front of women in a in a
business setting that's pretty
unacceptable would you agree with that
that if it's a business setting and it's
a mixed group that is unacceptable I
agree completely
but here's the thing
the allegation is that that Tucker
wasn't in the room
doctor wasn't there
it's actually about other people they're
trying to make accusations about other
people
stick to Tucker
Tucker said something privately in an
email or a text or something which is a
nothing
these other people did something which I
if if it happened I would agree that
would be inappropriate behavior and if I
had been the boss I would have I would
have tried to put an end to it because
it makes people uncomfortable and you
just don't need it
but
New York Times is trying really hard to
slime this guy and they have so little
there's just so little that they have to
work with what else they have then also
it was reported that somewhere around
the office there are multiple photos I
don't know why of Nancy Pelosi in a
bathing suit in Europe
now I don't know why I assume it's
because she doesn't look good in a
bathing suit because she's
90 or whatever she is is that what
but is that sexist
are you telling me that the men in the
office have never made fun of the the
body shape or the look of a man
the they've never made fun of you know
Chris Christie's weight
no
you don't think there's any man they've
ever made fun of do you think anybody on
Fox news ever said anything about
Trump's haircut
or or his weight
even
uh body shaving is the most like common
thing in politics as horrible as it is
I'm opposed to it but it's just so
common and it goes both ways I don't
know
that's that's all they got let's see
what else they have
uh that the accusation that no woman was
safe from being called a c word
should they be
should women be safe from being called a
bad insult
here's my opinion women should be safe
from that word
unless there's Sidney Powell and they
just said the Kraken is coming and then
you believed them because they seem to
be credible and then you screwed up
everything and you cost your network uh
three quarters of a billion dollars in
your job
if that happens to you yeah you can use
the c word
you can use it all day long under that
situation but no you don't re you know
you're not going to call your co-worker
who's five minutes late to the movie the
c word
if you're acting like calling the c word
is just always right or always wrong
that's dumb
it's not wrong
there is absolutely a place where that
word belongs
and I'm not going to lose it it's vital
to my communication strategy
I will reserve it for the worst of the
situations or when it's funny that works
too
all right for example
I would never use that word for a Kamal
Harris
because whatever I think about her that
that word doesn't seem to apply right it
just she has a competence problem
but for some people in some situations
is just the only word that works
all right uh West Virginia's Republican
Governor Jim Justice what a great name
for a politician
wouldn't you left your name to be
Justice
yeah this is a great last name Justice
um but he's 72 but he's going to run
against uh Senator manchin who's
uh sort of a Centrist Democrat
now you see this and you say to yourself
yay we could you know if you're
Republican you say yay you say yay we
could get uh another Republican in there
and mansions unpredictable sometimes he
likes us sometimes he doesn't so this
would be good right and then I read
about this guy's background
he owns a sprawling Empire of coal mines
processing facilities and agricultural
interests
that's very close to exactly the wrong
person for government isn't it
it's sort of like exactly the wrong
person
who was a coal magnate as a senator
like I think that you know coal is
necessary at the moment
but who wants a senator whose Financial
interests are completely tied up with
coal
do you think do you think somebody who
owns a sprawling you know coal industry
do you think that person is going to
give you an objective View
of you know climate and energy
that's crazy
it's so crazy that and then people say
oh he has a good chance we like him
that's crazy
anyway
um
so I saw this story that I'm so curious
about but I don't know the answer to it
which is Brian or romelli as I say
almost every day he's a great follow for
keeping up with what's happening with
the AI not just you know hey there's a
new app but really understanding the
implications and where it could go he's
the best one for that I think
and he tweeted about there was an
article about uh one-third of U.S teen
girls seriously considered and I won't
I'm not even gonna use the words
because I don't want to get demonetized
just for using words but let's just say
it was uh they considered doing
something that would
be the cessation of their mortal
existence
and that the the news said one-third of
U.S teens thought about it in 2021
according to the CDC
one-third so here's the first thing I
would add to the story
is that a lot
I don't know one-third sounds about
normal
sounds normal unfortunately so it might
be up but still it's a problem but uh
here's what Brian says about that when
we prompt AI
at any AI in a way that does not pay uh
homage to any agenda at all we arrive at
the response that we we arrive at the
reasons so that would be the reasons for
why the the one-third of U.S teen girls
have considered that and the question AI
asks us are we ready to hear it
oh my God
what does he know that we don't know yet
did did he ask it AI to explain what's
going on and didn't give him a
definitive answer
now I don't know that the answer is
right
but given that the answer would be you
know based on the collection of human
language Etc it might be something that
strikes us as right
because we think the way AI thinks in
many ways
uh you see that
you don't want it
what do you what do you think is the
answer
some people think they know the answer
oh we don't think the way AEI thinks
yeah we do
not every person
because every person thinks differently
than every other person so you can't say
AI thinks like every one of us but AI is
based on human thinking patterns it's
based on our language so in theory the
reason we can talk to it and it sounds
like a person is that it does match our
it matches our thinking process in
general
uh
well I guess I don't know if you know
the answer to that
all right uh Heineken is introducing
these new AI guides so to look like an
avatar on the screen in in airports
so I guess it's advertising you know
their their beer but at the same time
it's providing a service so it's better
than an advertisement that you can
interact with it so you can walk up to a
um
a deep fake looking CGI character and
you can just talk to it
and it will it'll help you in the
airport like tell you when your flights
are or whatever
now is that the greatest thing
in terms of commercializing AI That's
Just One of the best ideas I've seen
I would love to be able to talk to a
non-human entity to ask a question at an
airport do you know why
because talking to human entities in the
airport doesn't go well have you tried
yet you have to wait in line
you get up there and then they tell you
that the that station is closed well why
am I waiting in line for something this
closed oh I was just answering that one
question but we're closed you made me
wait in live
I waited in line you saw me waiting a
lie I didn't know when I got here you
say you're not open maybe you could have
told me that sooner and then you get
into a fight with them and all kinds of
things happen so yeah I want to talk to
the same reason I want to use an ATM
instead of using a teller I just don't
want the human problem in my transaction
I just want the information
um yeah
so here's another thing that uh
is a big deal so the
you've heard that
um
Biden is going to charge people with
good credit who have loans they'll pay
an extra 50 bucks a month or something
and that will help pay for people who
have bad credit but also would like to
get loans
now it turns out
that this will hurt Asian Americans more
than white applicants because not only
will the Asian Americans have the
highest credit scores in general
says this report but
they also get turned down for loans more
than white people did you know that
did you know that Asian Americans have
the highest credit
but they get turned down more than white
Americans who do not have as good a
credit
is that a racism
is that is that obvious racism
probably let me give you a counter
argument you ready for the weirdest
counter argument you will never see this
one coming
all right this is one that you would not
see coming at all
you ready I've told you this story
before but now I'm going to tie it to
this story I used to be a commercial
lender
and I would make loans for small
businesses usually dentists and
um professionals like that
and my job was to review loan
applications
so I would look at all all the factors
of their credit worthiness and then I
would take it to my boss who would be
the final sign off but I would make a
recommendation you would typically agree
with
so I've done all the work I bring it to
my boss and I say here's a loan it's for
uh I think it was a dentist office and
as you can see the person asking for the
loan they show their income and they
show what it will take to service the
loan and you can see that they don't
have enough money
to qualify under our standards
and my boss who had been a lender for 40
years
takes the application from me and while
I'm telling him that they don't have
enough money to pay back the loan
he writes approved on it
while I'm telling them they don't have
enough money to pay the loan
and I said uh what just happened here
so now you're thinking it's because it's
white people right he was a white guy
so you think he basically just gave the
white people the loan are you is that
what you're thinking
nope Asian American he was a white guy
but he said uh no now I'm gonna I'm
gonna tell you what he said this is not
from me right because what he said is
super racist
I'm just reporting what he said
he said Asians lie about their income to
save taxes
and I said what
I said yeah it's so typical that you can
count on it
and I said
what
are you freaking kidding me
you're gonna sign this loan that
literally says he can't pay for it
he goes yes
and then he gave me the kill shot you
ready for the kill shot
he points to the other side of the
office and this big Bank of files and he
says go look at all the files of the
defaulted loans because it was it was
just all the people who defaulted on
their loans he goes spend the day there
and tell me how many Asian surnames you
find in the file
that was the end of the conversation
there weren't any
you said there already I've been doing
this for 40 years
there aren't any
do you know why
now he explained it's not necessarily
just that their cash flow is better than
they report right it's not necessarily
that
it's also
some kind of a cultural necessity
that if you make a loan you're paying it
back
if you need a second job you're paying
it back if you default because you
simply don't have the money even after
it defaults
they pay it back
do you know how rare that is and he told
me the story about somebody who you know
couldn't pay back a loan Asian American
and it got written off
so his you know his credit was bad and
basically everything that that could
happen bad had already happened and he
didn't need to pay it back
so at that point he was off the hook
and he paid it back
because he couldn't live
with an unpaid loan you just just no I'm
not going to do that and he took you
know great
you know personal uh you know extra work
and sacrifice and he paid it all back
paid it paid back every penny
so
here's what I think might be happening
if you tell me that Asian Americans are
getting turned down more often
I feel as if maybe lenders stop doing
what that old lender did a million years
ago which is
discriminate he just actively
discriminated but he was discriminating
against white people in a sense because
he was favoring another group which is
different I guess
but it could be that
that the loans are coming in not looking
as good and they're being turned down
for reasons that are not exactly have
anything to do with race whatsoever so
it could be that there's actually no
racial component whatsoever
it's just that some some loan
applications come in looking differently
than others it might be just that
so that's just speculation I have no way
of knowing
what but if you've never heard that
story
does that blow your mind
the sort of a mind-blowing story is that
that's one of the most influential
stories of my life
is about the benefit of a good character
basically so the benefit of good
character in the Asian Americans got
them a lot of loans
that maybe the paperwork said they
shouldn't have gotten so good for them
[Applause]
good for them and and by the way I think
that we should address whatever that
inequality is with the loan approvals
somebody needs to dig into that because
if it's not if it's not what I said
what the hell is it
have you ever met a banker who didn't
want to make a loan to a qualified Asian
American
is that a thing is there any Banker in
America who doesn't eagerly you know
love that loan they love it so the fact
that they're they're getting turned down
more than white people
that is a mystery I think we need to
figure that out but it might not be the
answer that you think it is it might not
be racial discrimination it just might
not be
but I'd worry about it so I'd look into
it it's worth looking
all right
uh is there any Banker that can override
AI recommendations sure
maybe not in the long run but in the
short run yes
all right anecdotes don't matter
um
2008 crisis was about making loans to
people who couldn't pay them back yes
all right ladies and gentlemen that's
all I got for you on YouTube I'm gonna
say bye and then talk to my locals folks
here for a bit best live screen live
stream you've ever seen bye for now see
you tomorrow
