you might say to yourself
scott did you intend to go live just now
and the answer is nope
nope you are accidentally live
my problem is that i was taking my
profile picture in which i was wearing
these dark glasses
which requires you to then push the
proper button
while your eyes are concealed
so i push the go live button instead of
the take a profile picture button
so here we are a little earlier than
usual
we've got 12 minutes until real showtime
uh and i can either
turn it off and start again at the right
time or i can just start you early
what do you think why don't we uh take
some questions while we're waiting for
the official
simultaneous sip
uh look sunny there well no actually
it's completely dark here let me show
you
what you're seeing is that the the light
is a little high
for some reason
china hack today yeah they they hacked
my shades
but you can look out the window here
pitch black
or the beginning of a day
let's see your bathroom what that's the
weirdest question of the day
will california survive yeah we'll all
survive
we will all survive because we're
awesome
the judge just released a forensic audit
of dominion voting machines
no that didn't happen
i don't believe that there was an audit
of dominion voting machines
i don't think that happened
was the vietnam war good for america
i don't see how that's the
these are the most random questions i
kind of like random questions
the simultaneous sip will not happen
until the appropriate time
uh chinese misinformation is already
blaming russia for the hack
that's funny
uh what's chris what's christina getting
for christmas
well she spells her name with a k first
of all
well i'm not going to reveal any
christmas secrets
what's what's the approximate time so at
uh
10 a.m eastern we will uh go live with
the show i
for those of you just streaming and uh
there there are two buttons on the
screen when i'm getting ready to go live
one of the buttons retakes the the
thumbnail picture that you see and the
other one goes live
and uh unfortunately i hit the wrong
button
again what kind of workout do you do
well i'll tell you my gym is closed
i'm in california so my workout
situation is getting kind of bad right
now
i have to admit that if i don't get out
of my house
it's really hard to work out inside the
house
way harder than i thought it would be so
i'm going to need a new system for that
uh what's with the pictures lately i
don't know what that means
uh how can you say the great reset is a
hoax when it came from the world
economic forum well what do you think is
the great reset
so everybody's asking me about the great
reset and let me tell you what this is
this is what i call word thinking
so the great reset is a hundred percent
true
if you define those words great reset
to define what's actually happening and
the great reset
absolutely does not exist if you define
it to
not be what we observe happening
so to say whether the great reset exists
or doesn't exist
is nonsense because everybody just puts
their own meaning to it
so does your meaning
attach to that word well if you wanted
to but it's not up to me to say that the
the weird definition you've put on some
words
is either right or wrong it's just what
you did
now beyond that i think there's there's
nothing to talk about beyond that
there are certainly people who would
like to use the pandemic
as a as a jumping off point to make some
good changes in their opinion
but there are lots of people who would
like to change it lots of different ways
there's nothing really that's changed
um
if you would like to be more specific on
this question of the great reset which i
say
is uh just a conspiracy theory despite
the fact
that real people have said it out loud
and there's a book about it
i think what's happening is people are
conflating
what people are really saying with what
they imagine they really have in mind or
something like that somebody says you're
missing a lot
well let me let me admit this let me
admit i am aggressively ignoring the
story
because it's so obvious that it's not
true
there are some things that you sort of
have to look into
to know if it's if there's something to
it and there are other things you really
don't
there are things you don't need to look
into them to know that they're not true
this would be one of them
now if here's here's how you'd know if
the great reset is true
and ask yourself and again i don't even
know what's included in the great reset
you know something about changing the
economy socialism
global world order i don't know whatever
but give me the one thing that you think
people are suggesting
as the great reset just one thing
one fact under the umbrella of the great
reset that you believe is true
that you don't think i think is true
there's your test
name one thing about the great reset
that you believe is true just a specific
detail of a thing that will happen
that you think that i don't think is
true
i bet you can't find one and i don't
think the great
reset is even a thing but yeah i'll bet
you would find no detail that we would
disagree on
uh ubi cashless society yeah of course
all of those things will be
tested and phased in over time i think
that's a guarantee
nobody's talking about a dictatorship
global socialism is the same
conversation we've always had
some people want it some people don't
there's
what's different why do you need a new
name just to talk about
some people want socialism and some
people don't
uh forced vaccinations i mean these are
not part of the great reset
these are just things that some people
want
they're going to inject us with nanobots
as somebody says
new world order is renamed yeah
i guess first you would have to figure
out what is the great reset
in your minds and then tell me what is
the one
biggest part of it you know the element
you think really captures the essence of
whatever issue you think this is and
then tell me that you think that i
disagree with that
because i think it's going to be
something such as lots of people want
more socialism
right okay
so is that something we just learned
that lots of people need want more
socialism
i don't think so
schwab is right on essential casting
somebody says see i'm just not paying
any attention to that one guy
because because i hear you saying klaus
schwab wrote a book
about the great reset so
a lot of people write books
it means nothing organized
global governance show me somebody who's
in favor of that
in the public eye i mean other than
it would be good to have an organized
world that would be good
so i don't think that's a problem and i
hope you are enjoying
your little extra time here
on pre-coffee with scott adams
all right yeah all that bilderberg stuff
here's what i think is true and what is
not
so i've told you some of you before so
we've got four minutes before we go live
here
i've told some of you before that in the
past four years i've gotten to see a
little bit behind the curtain
so there are a lot of things that i did
not know were true
a few years ago that once you sort of
get
to know some of the insiders you hear
the real story of things behind the
scenes
and i got to tell you the real story of
most things
is not very close to what's in the news
when you can talk to the actual people
involved it's just
always completely different and
but i have not detected
an illuminati i have not detected any
bilderberg
stuff or any davos stuff for
new world order or any of it
so i i'm pretty far behind the curtain
on a lot of stuff
you know there's there are people who
are further behind than i am but
i've been pretty deep under the hood
of what really is happening in this
country and i don't see any of that
stuff
that what's really happening is just
lots of individuals
battling for their own little corner of
control
and lots of those individuals know other
individuals
and on any given issue you could see
certain
elements by you know uh getting together
to make some issue happen
but it tends to be individuals and
individual
issues what i've never seen once
is any organized group of people or even
anybody who knows of them
or somebody who's rumored about them or
anything
about some organized group of people
trying to create a new world order
and any of that so as
as as deep under the hood as i've been
for the last several years
i would have seen some of that i mean i
would have seen
something to suggest that some of that
was true i mean i'm
pretty pretty far you know behind the
curtain a lot of this stuff and i don't
see any of it
now there are there are plenty of things
that are surprising
you know when you get when you get
behind the curtain but none of it in
that
realm get your eyes checked
somebody says the illuminati somebody
says the illuminati has their own
website so
it must be true open border society
yup um
they openly say it at the u.n
so there are people who openly say lots
of things that
aren't going to happen there are there
are people the
people openly calling for everything you
can think of
so it doesn't matter that people are
calling for things
that has no predictive no predictive
benefit
all right we are one minute away from
the best
time of the day in case you wonder
what happens in the minutes before i go
live
you know this is when i print out my
notes
and if my computer would
maybe work for a minute there we go
this is where i print out my notes and
while i'm waiting to go live
which is happening right now
hold on for a second you youtubers i
gotta bring
you gotta bring the uh periscope people
online you ready
here we go
[Applause]
if you hear that sound that is my
printer printing out
my notes for what will be best show ever
i'm trying to reach this without ripping
my microphone and my lapel
and i did it yes i did it
well congratulations you made it to the
best show
in the whole world yeah it's this one
and if you would like to maximize your
pleasure
i think you know how all you need is a
couple of margaret glass of tanker
chelsea's die in a canteen flask
a vessel
of any kind please excuse the humming
sound you hear as i
close my motorized shades and adjust my
lighting
to make it perfect for you now
if you'd like to join me for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes
everything better except dominion
software
it's called the simultaneous sip and
here it comes
go
yes i have to tell you that i
accidentally hit the go
live button on youtube a number of
minutes early
as i was i was trying to wear these
funny glasses on youtube
and uh click the button for my profile
picture
but when i have those glasses on i can't
see the screen and i hit the go live
button and well it doesn't matter
so we hear that the city of portland has
negotiated with the
black lives matter and antifa groups in
the autonomous zone
to leave the autonomous zone so there
you go
it turns out that portland has cleared
out the autonomous zone
now my suggestion is that they leave it
the way it is
after they get rid of the people and
they turn it into a
a museum for socialism
because we have a holocaust museum right
and it's very valuable so you don't
forget your history of the holocaust
i feel as if it's good to have a museum
for any big event so that people can not
have to relive it
right the whole point of the holocaust
museum is so you don't get another
holocaust
it's pretty important i would say as
museums
go the holocaust museum might be the
most important museum of all time
because it keeps us
it keeps it in our memory but i think we
also need a socialism
museum just keep the autonomous zone as
crappy as it is
and you know just say you can't clean up
the graffiti
and you can't fix the broken windows you
have to leave them boarded or whatever
and make it like a historical zone so
even the business owners don't have a
legal right to fix up their business
say oh i know you want to fix up your
business and get back
back to business but we can't let you do
that because we've declared it
an historic zone so historically you had
a broken window you're going to have to
keep that because the tourists are going
to want to see it just the way it was
one of my better ideas i think we'll
just make that
because because let me be honest if you
went to portland
let's say you felt it was safe to go to
portland and you were going to be there
anyway on business
and you knew that there was an
autonomous zone that you could go visit
to see what socialism does in just a few
short months
you'd check it out wouldn't you quite
seriously
in all seriousness wouldn't you check
out the autonomous
zone if you were in portland anyway you
might not make a special trip there
it's not like you know
it's not like a gettysburg or something
but if you were there anyway you'd go
look
all right so
i saw newt gingrich asking this question
on twitter he said
why would georgia's secretary of state
rafsenberger refuse to release the
list of newly registered voters
what's he trying to hide why georgia
legislature should demand
now is that information that we're not
allowed to have
that i don't know if there's any
confidentiality element to that
i don't think there's a confidential
confidentiality aspect right
might be but if there's no
confidentiality
of the people on the list why can't we
see the list of recently
registered people because it seems to me
that the list of recently registered
if there were a problem
that's where it would be do we all agree
well let's put it this way would you all
agree that if you saw the list of
recently registered people in georgia
and you scrubbed through it and you
audited it
and you found that there were no real
problems
what would you think of the election in
georgia
if you could actually see that the
recently registered people were
almost all entirely legitimate what
would that tell you
for me that would be a game changer
i would still think well you got all
these other places there could have been
problems and i'd be very concerned about
them
but this is sort of the biggest question
in my mind
if if you could let's put it this way
let's say
you had the ability to ask one question
of georgia about the election just one
question
maybe your one question could be you
know can i see the the voting machine
software or maybe your one question is
can i see the uh can i check the names
on the ballot
envelopes but you only have one question
and that's it and if your one question
doesn't find any fraud you don't get any
more questions
you're just done my one question
would be show me the list of recently
registered people
now if this checks out and is clean
i would go that would go a long way
toward convincing me that at least the
the balloting part of it the physical
balloting part of it
wasn't as bad as i thought it was right
it would be the one thing that would
actually make me think huh
i was pretty sure that there was you
know a high chance for fraud
but if if the entire recently registered
people in georgia were all legitimate or
you know 99 whatever if they were mostly
legitimate
i'd kind of drop my objections i think
i'd still have all these questions about
the software and things but those are
ongoing
questions i would definitely drop my
objection
if that list turned out to be clean
because i feel if there's one place
you're gonna find mischief
that's where you're going to find it not
that there isn't mischief anywhere else
but
if it's not there then
i'd sort of be a little bit easier to
convince that maybe the election was
close enough to fair but if you can't
show me this
if you can't show me the one most likely
place there's a problem
and i'm guessing just in context i don't
know this for sure
but in context because it's being asked
for i'm assuming that we can legally
have it there must be a legal process to
get it
pretty important don't you think
all right there are more reports uh
credible sounding report that doesn't
make it true but
it's credible sounding from a democrat
who worked for governor
cuomo who said that
he sexually harassed her for years i
think she worked there for him for
three years so when she says four years
it's
maybe three years or something and she
says many saw and watched
i could never anticipate what to expect
would i be grilled on my work which was
very good
or harassed about my looks or would it
be both in the same conversation
uh this was the way for years
how bad do you think it was because
uh i i'm gonna say this without
i don't know if i could even do this you
know the way the world is today it's
hard to have any kind of nuance
but i'm going to try to do it so i'll
start by saying i don't have an opinion
of whether the allegations are true or
false i don't have an opinion
i would say it falls into the category
of credible sounding
so you know it's in the category of
things that have to be taken seriously
but that has nothing to do with whether
it's true you can take things seriously
and then
find out they're not but it's credible
enough and
she's a democrat and she worked for him
so you don't imagine that she has some
political reason and she's even running
for office as a democrat
so she doesn't sound like the kind of
person who would make something up but
you never know
right anybody could lie so here's what
i'd like to know
she's very non-specific about these
charges
except that she referred to being
harassed
about her looks what do you think that
looked like
if you were to imagine you know if
somebody says she was a female
she worked in the governor's office and
she was quote harassed about her looks
try to imagine what that looked like
it could be it's a pretty big range
isn't it and i think the range
goes from uh a guy from an earlier
generation who didn't quite know where
the
where the line was again i'm not
defending him
there's no defense being offered here
i'm just describing
that cuomo is a certain age and there's
guys at a certain age
clearly don't have the the vision
if you will to know where the line was
because the line
in their minds or in their experience
they imagined the line with somebody
somewhere else all their life but maybe
it wasn't if you know what i mean
right they always imagined they were
doing the things that were okay
but maybe they never were they're just
finding out about it now
so what did that look like did it look
like an older guy who was a little
clueless
complimenting an employer an employee
too creepily is that what it was
was he was he saying that she looked
good
but he shouldn't have because it's not
not appropriate in the office
probably if i had to guess
it probably was in the category of
comments about her attractiveness now do
you think that cuomo would be
aware that he was doing something wrong
in the context of what he felt
was a compliment now again i don't know
the details maybe he did something
it could be that you know there was
something worse going on there
but if what he was doing was awkwardly
complimenting
because she's not specific so we don't
know but if he was awkwardly
complimenting in that
you know too sexual way in in you know
in our current times i think everybody
agrees that that's inappropriate
so there's no defense of him but i feel
like
it's important to know what it was right
because wouldn't you feel differently
about it if
cuomo was just clueless and he
just sort of thought he was being
friendly and complimentary
but in fact he had crossed the line and
he was he was inappropriate
i feel like that's a whole different
crime right
being every in the comments everybody's
making
comments about italian all right uh
i i i'm not going to say that that's
part of the story
but it would be true that some let's say
some people with different backgrounds
might have a different opinion of what
is appropriate that's that's fair to say
but we don't know if that's part of the
story uh
i just feel like in all fairness to
cuomo
we the public having heard this
allegation should know a little bit more
about it
not that it's our right i guess but
wouldn't you like to know more
i'd like to know if he was just being
clueless which feels like a different
thing
even though there's a victim right that
doesn't make her less of a victim just
because he
wasn't quite aware of what he was he was
doing
i guess we all agree with that in 2020
but
i'd like to know how aware he was that
he was doing something wrong that
matters
i think that matters uh cnn
uh brian stelter was mocking fox news
for its excessive coverage of the uh
hunter biden stuff
so according to cnn fox is covering it
too much
putting too much emphasis on it and
according to brian stelter
the more emphasis you put on it the more
journalistic judgment you're putting
that it's an important story
is that not an important story
that well we're going to talk about this
a little bit more
but it takes a lot of guts for cnn who
had been mocked
for ignoring the story to mock fox news
for
covering it too much
it's is it not just
funny at this it feels like it's just
uh it doesn't even seem like it's
serious anymore
the the difference between uh stelter
mocking fox for covering the biggest
story in the country
how is that really different from an snl
parody i mean the the parody reality
worlds are are bumping into each other
pretty hard right now
all right uh
so i was reading in the uh epic
epoch i never know how to spell it but
epoch times
and other places that uh the biggest
story
is that this company called solar winds
who make software this solar wind sounds
like it's a windmill company or
something
but solarwinds makes software it's a
software that many big companies and
governments
use the problem is the solar winds has
admitted
that there was a hack that looks like it
gave
china what they call god mode
access to anything that solar winds was
touching
i'm exaggerating a little bit but uh not
everything
but basically china had god mode access
which means they could control
anything within the system that they had
breached
they could change anything and
one of the companies that the solarwinds
works with
is dominion software so as of today
this is what we know
that china had god access
to the american voting software which
means
they could have done anything
now we're still waiting for a real
confirmation
because there is there is reporting that
solar winds is part of the dominion
software
suite i guess meaning that it was part
of the system
and if it's true that you could get god
access
we still we still need to know if that
really happened
you know did did china actually really
literally have god access to our voting
system
during the election because that's the
accusation as of today
that's the accusations don't know if
it's true
like everything else we don't know if
it's true
kind of looks true um and i would like
to be the first to
thank china because you know it you it's
easy to get
distracted by what looks like the bad
news but then you would be burying the
the big news there's a much bigger story
here
and nobody's reporting it that's why you
watch me you watch me to report the
stories that are ignored by the major
media
and this is the biggest story china
had got access to our voting software
all right so that's the part we think we
know as of today
what we also know because the news
is pretty clear on this there's no
evidence of
russian interference in our election
is that great or what no evidence
we have not had one report on cnn
of any russian interference in the
election now
if china had got access to our elections
and russia did not interfere what does
that tell you
well put two and two together china
obviously saved us
china is the only reason we had a free
and fair election because they got into
our software
with their god mode and they kept russia
out thank you
thank you china because imagine if china
did not have full access to our voting
software
russia russia would get in there putin
has poisoned people
you can't trust putin in your software
right the last person you'd want in the
world
to be in your voting software would be
russia so thankfully
china got there first and prevented
russia from
throwing the election to trump you know
they would have
putin loves himself he loves some trump
so
the fact that trump did not win i think
we can conclude that china saved us
they saved us from russia and
interference um and they did it just by
hacking into the software that it got
into her would have given them access
hypothetically to our voting software
um by the way what i just did is a
hypnotist
trick called getting inside someone's
illusion
the illusion is that we had a fair and
free election
if you argue it and say no we didn't
then the other side will say what show
me the proof
and you'll say well i don't have proof
but i got a lot of evidence
i got lots and lots of evidence and then
what will the other side say
well why did the court ignore all your
evidence and then i'll say
well they didn't really look at the
evidence they looked at the standing
and they looked at whether they wanted
to overthrow an election
and they decided not to do those things
but they never really looked at
the evidence so you're saying you have
no proof
no so you're just using the words wrong
proof
would be something that the courts or
science might do
evidence is what gets you into the court
that's what gets you
into the court and then once in the
court you would have a
chance to prove or not prove so
we never got to the point where the
question of proof
is really even the question because we
didn't get to where we could determine
if there's proof
so what you're saying is there's no
proof yes
yes technically that is what i'm saying
but you do get that there can't be any
proof
the way our system works until you got
the evidence
into the court and
then maybe you could find out some proof
so
since we didn't get the evidence of
which there are
mountains thousands of affidavits
and statistical likelihoods but that
mountain of evidence never got into the
court
therefore it couldn't become proof
and then you're the person you're
debating with will look you right behind
say
so you're saying there's no proof
that's how that would go if you just
argue it directly
if you don't argue it directly you do
the hypnotist trick which i just did
i modeled it for you the hypnotist trick
is instead of denying
somebody's story which you know is
 you enter it
you enter it like it's true that's what
i did
and i thanked china and said thank god
you saved us from russian interference
now the problem is that by entering it i
ruin it
so instead of attacking it where it
stays coherent whoever is defending it
keeps it coherent
as best they can but if you enter it and
acknowledge it as true
yeah there was this was a fair and free
election and there's only one way it
could have happened
now that we know china had got access
the only way this
free and fair election could have
happened is
thank you china because it was their
decision that it'd be
free and fair not ours did you have got
access to the election
because if you had access to the
election software i'd be thanking you
because apparently you kept it free and
fair that's what the news reported it
was free and fair
despite having an open door so
anyway that's the hypnosis trick you get
into the illusion you accept it as true
and then you ruin it just by talking
about it like it's true
it's very effective
so let's see what we know so far
um you all know that google went down
all morning
and here's what's interesting google did
not only go down
it all went down from gmail to
to youtube now
ask yourself this what kind of a problem
would take all of google down
now you can see lots you can imagine
lots of problems that would slow things
down you can imagine
i think we've all experienced gmail
being down
but it's just down by itself have you
ever seen
all of google go down all of it
what would cause that could it be a bug
could it be a bug probably not
because if you're telling me that google
is so sensitive
that they would have that one bug could
take it all down
i mean what kind of bug would that be
that's some big bug
i doubt they've architected it so that
one bug
could take down all the unrelated
systems maybe
i mean i can't say that's impossible
there might be some
central thing that connects them all but
somebody says a power outage power
outage probably wouldn't take it all
down
because i imagine their power is backed
up it's distributed against servers
around the world
what would it be now do you think that
china hacked them and took them down i
doubt it we'd know about that
right if it had been a china hack that's
the first thing they would have told us
youtube or i'm sorry google would have
said we have some foreign hackers
going to be down for a while don't think
it was that
let me tell you what it probably was and
this is just speculation right so
there's no
there's nothing except timing i think
google had maybe a solar wind problem
i think it's possible that google said
uh
do we use that software that gives you
god access to all your systems that
china has
hacked do we have any of that and
i'm just i'm just going to make a guess
pure speculation
that that uh youtube realized they were
massively violated
across their products and they took it
all down to get rid of the same hack
or the same vulnerability because it
would have been across all products
so was this solar winds thing
so bad that the entire google spectrum
was infected and they had to take it all
down at the same time
or is it the biggest coincidence in the
world
that google had its biggest you know
downtime
that across all products at the same
time we find out that there's this
nearly universal software that seems to
be in lots of big companies
that has got access and china
controls it which do you think is more
likely
coincidence or these two stories are
connected
because it would be a pretty big
coincidence wouldn't it
just ask it and by the way have you seen
anybody else ask that question am i the
first one to connect those
um i don't know i would think other
people have made that connection
doesn't mean it's true by the way i'm
not alleging it's true
i'm just saying wouldn't you be a little
curious
about whether there's a connection uh
somebody says in the comments did google
try rebooting that's
that's always the good thing to try
first
if we'd only thought of rebooting all
right
um one of the most interesting things
about this hack
uh and china's bad behavior because we
also know that china
we found out they have two million
chinese communist party members working
in various industries and governments
around the world and now we know who
they are
so we know that we know they're sending
us fentanyl we know that they're
doing all manner of bad things and the
funny part is that trump is going to
leave all this for biden because there
just won't be enough time for trump to
do
much about it so biden is going to be
left with the biggest problem in the
world
china in a in a hot war that just
happens to be a cyber war but it's a hot
war
it's definitely not a cold war and biden
will have to do that
while he is the weakest president we've
ever had
for this challenge i've told you before
and i'll tell you a million times
there's no such thing as a good
president
or a bad one that's not a thing
there's no such thing as a good
president who does a good job
or a bad president who does a bad job
and if you think in those terms you're
just fooling yourself
what there is is some presidents are
well
suited for some kinds of challenges and
maybe those challenges happen to come up
during their term
perfect but there are other challenges
where that same personality that is just
tremendous
doing this other stuff is just the wrong
fit
for the new thing for example who's the
best one to negotiate with china i would
say trump
by far not even close
now whether or not trump could have
succeeded
ultimately with china we don't know but
there's no question he was the right
personality for it
who was the right personality for the
coronavirus and telling us to wear masks
not trump trump was not the right guy
to be in a science-related conversation
even though i would you know you could
argue he was more right than the experts
but the public did not like his
personality
which had been painted by his critics as
being non-scientific
they didn't like that match of him with
that task
what happens when you match biden with
the task
of a war with china at the same time
that his own family
has these chinese connections he's
exactly the wrong guy
in fact you could not on paper come up
with a more wrong person for this
challenge
which happens to be our biggest
challenge
by far now you could argue that the
coronavirus is the biggest challenge but
it's also temporary
thanks to trump we know now that the
coronavirus has a timer on it because
the vaccines will take care of it in six
months or whatever it takes
so our biggest problem doesn't require
biden he is actually a pretty good fit
for the you know wear your mask and do
your social
distancing and stuff he's pretty good
fit for that but
it's not going to matter because the
vaccine is what's going to matter
and that was trump so you have the worst
mismatch you could possibly have of a
president
biden who could be terrific for a number
of things
i could easily imagine that president
biden would do a good job on health care
i don't know that he will but it's easy
to imagine that he could
it's easy to imagine that he could do
you know
lower the temperature of racial stuff
it's easy to imagine he could do that he
might be exactly the right guy for that
but he is exactly the wrong guy for our
biggest problem
which is china so here are the things
that
we know for sure and let me start with
this
could we retaliate against china if we
wanted to
because correct me if i'm wrong doesn't
china still own too much of our critical
industry
in other words if if we said hey we'll
throw out all of your
your diplomats we'll stop negotiating
with you or whatever wouldn't china just
say
well i guess you're not going to have
any pharmaceuticals
wouldn't china say well so much for your
rare earth
minerals which drive your entire tech
business
couldn't china say well so much for your
national debt we're not going to buy any
of that
we're going to sell that as fast as we
can so
have we reached a point where we can't
break up with china
because they own too much of us but they
can attack
us non-stop as long as it's you know
cyber and dirty tricks and fentanyl and
stuff like that
and we'll just let them because we have
too many entanglements
because that's our current situation our
current situation is that they're
holding us by the caller
and punching us and we don't have
anything we can do about that
because if they let go of our caller
let's say their economic
connections to us or pharmaceutical
control or
everything else if they let go of our
collar we fall into the you know
the abyss but if they if we let them
hold our collar and keep punching us
then we get punched to death so china
has created a situation where we have
two ways to lose no way to win
we can't break up with them and we can't
punch them back
where does that lead can't leave them
can't punch them back
and they're punching us as hard as they
can every single day there's
only one way that can go and it's not
good
so priority number one
should be to bring our industry home and
it should be
number one priority because if you don't
bring
industry home and i don't know what we
can do about debt
i don't understand that well enough but
if we don't bring our critical industry
home
as a moonshot like
deal i mean this should be our next
moonshot like thing i guess the vaccine
was sort of a moonshot
but we should be bringing the industry
back like there's nothing else that
matters
we should be acting like we're at war
and bringing these industries back
is a uh a war powers act
kind of thing you know we we should just
put a quarter of our economy on bringing
that back
because there's nothing more important
otherwise we just get punched to death
we have no
no defense all right so here here's a
list of things we know about
our current situation some of these are
connected and some of them are just
sort of context number one things we
know
joe biden ran for president because he
fell for the fine people hoax
he says so now he doesn't call it a hoax
because he
doesn't know so he literally ran for
president because he believed
a hoax the most debunked hoax in
american history
if if there were only one thing to know
knowing that would be probably
plenty scary but number two we know that
50 past
and current american intelligence
professionals
lied to the american public about the
hunter biden's
laptop story being almost certainly
russian
disinformation at this point you know
they lied right
now you could if you were being very
generous you could say well there are
50 past and current professionals who
were
fooled and they didn't know
isn't that just as bad which of these
two things is worse
that 50 past and present american
intelligence
professionals knew less than you did
about hunter biden because every one of
you who was watching the story
knew there was something there and you
knew it wasn't russian disinformation am
i right
am i right in saying that every one of
you watching this
knew it wasn't true when 50 of our
current and past intelligent
professionals
said that it was russian disinformation
i would say that every one of you knew
that wasn't true
every one of you watching this anyway i
don't know about democrats
but so there are only two possibilities
that
brennan and 50 people that we thought
were our greatest patriots
turned on the united states that's one
possibility
that they turned that all 50 of them
are traders that's actually a
possibility
that all 50 of them committed a form of
treason if you will right in front of
you
or they're insanely incompetent
we're down to two choices the choice
we've ruled out is
they are correct and
and honest we can rule that one out
correct and honest so they're either
wrong
and they're dumber than every
person watching this
and they're the ones who are supposed to
be the smart ones
or they lied to you because they're
traitors
those are the only possibilities and
we're just living with that
we're living with that like that's okay
oh that's okay
i don't see a problem here
here's another thing we know the
so-called news industry
is mostly involved in propaganda now
wouldn't you say that's a fair statement
we don't really have a news industry
in terms of politics we still have news
about
you know tech technical advances and
natural disasters but we don't have a
news industry when it comes to
political stories because we can't trust
any of it
i wouldn't trust the political story on
the left or the right right now
would you we don't have a news industry
we actually don't it just became a
propaganda industry
it's just two different sides now
sometimes you can glean what's true by
you know triangulating the different
 stories
but we actually don't have a news
industry literally we don't have one
now there are smaller outlets that still
will break a story
and new york post and you know breitbart
will break his story
but our biggest outlets are not even
real anymore they're not even
they're not even a shadow of anything
real at this point
here's something else we know we know
that china had a god mode access
to our voting systems we think we know
that i'd still wait for a confirmation
on that
we know that uh china probably and i'll
say probably
because we can't know this for certain
but china probably has lots of black
male material on the biden family
and put this all together let me read
these all together so you can see the
whole
the whole thing our leader in this
country fell for the fine people hoax
and still thinks it's real
right so he's a senior citizen who can't
tell the difference between an obvious
hoax
and reality he can't tell the difference
that's who your president is that's real
50 of our intelligence people past and
presence lied to
us or are traitors or are stupid that's
real
the news industry doesn't exist in this
country that's real
that's not hyperbole it is not higher
probability to say we don't have a news
industry
anymore if we ever did i don't know if
we ever did it's not hyperbole to say
that china had god access mode to our
voting software at the same time
that our fake news the propaganda news
is telling us that there's a 100 chance
that the election was fair
no doubt about it at the same time we
know that china had access to our voting
software
can those two things be true can it be
true that we know the election was fair
and free but we also know that china had
access to do whatever they wanted with
the software
both true no problem right that's what's
been reported by the
non-news and and once you realize that
china has
you know too much control over our
economy for us to do anything
here's my question why are there any
chinese diplomats
still in this country why is there
you know any of these 2 000 people who
were
on the list they got hacked of chinese
communist
party members who are in business and
industry around the united states
is there still one of those people who
just went to work today
is there somebody on that ccp list of
known
chinese communist members
communist party members working on
american businesses and
government industries are any of those
people
did they just go to work today
is that how we play them oh well you
know we're looking into it
so they just go to work did that happen
it's just a question because if we have
not already
fired every one of them uh what's wrong
what's wrong and i have a bigger
question why are there any chinese
diplomats in the united states
after we know these stories to be true
why are there any chinese diplomats left
they should be gone
48 hours we should have no chinese
citizens in our colleges or businesses
or even in embassies we should get rid
of all of them
and i don't know any way that that's
going to happen because i don't think
trump has enough you know
energy left to do that in his final days
in the office
and i don't think biden can so
did we already lose to china
i mean i don't think the game is over
but it's starting to look like
we already surrendered because if we're
not going to fight back and that's what
it looks like
at this point it looks like we're not
even going to push back
we're just going to accept
that they controlled our election
software we're just okay with that
now apparently in 2018 there was a
was it a legislation or an executive
order i'm not sure
about what we would do or how we would
retaliate
if we found that a foreign entity
influenced our elections and apparently
those retaliations would include
you know freezing all of their
businesses in this country and basically
putting a stop on the economic
everything you know the banking whatever
when does that get uh yes it's the 2018
executive order eo 2018 and
when does that come into play did we
just
make a make a law and then we're just
gonna we're just gonna ignore it or an
executive order
so there's an executive order on the
books that is triggered by
exactly the situation we're in
what's happening have you heard the
president say
that we're not going to trigger it or
that we are
i'd sort of like to know about that
wouldn't you all right
so that's where we are today and that's
about all i have for today
uh it's going to be it's going to be a
tough next month
because joe biden doesn't make much news
and it's a slow news you know time
so without a president trump we're going
gonna have a really slow
news uh month or two maybe when biden is
inaugurated things will get interesting
again
but we'll see
bill gates says lockdown should continue
into 2022.
well i don't see how that would be a
thing if we have vaccinations
so i don't know what that story is about
somebody says that michigan dominion
report is out and fraud was confirmed i
don't believe anything you see in the
comments so you should look into the
look into that if
uh that's true uh am i going to watch
biden do what get inaugurated i missed
that
uh let's see we'll make it to
100 fine for interfering with elections
yeah
uh just hypnotize us to be happy
well you know uh you can reframe your
situation
to make yourself happy i i gave a lesson
on reframing on the
locals.com platform subscription
platform
where i give my little lessons on
everything from how to be more effective
to how to be more happy
so i saved that for there
all right um please have gordon chang on
your periscope oh you know
uh i do now have the software for
live streaming uh interviews so it's the
stream yard software it's the first
thing i found that actually worked
so i'll probably do some interviews
going forward
i don't know how many but i'll do a few
we'll see if i like it
uh
so there's a cr senator crenshaw video
somebody says is good i'll take a look
at that
reframe biden
wow okay that's all i got for now and
i'll talk to you
tomorrow
and goodbye to you on youtube as well
