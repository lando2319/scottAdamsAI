how unprepared i am today
i got my microphones
how's
this yeah let's go brandon
oh
did my printer not work
yes it did yes
well it looks like i'm a little bit late
but
you know
sometimes good things are worth waiting
for
this isn't one of those cases
but i hear good things are worth waiting
for
that's my volume today let's see if i
can call up the comments here
uh
yeah i can call up the comments here
there we go
how's everybody doing this morning
is this the best thing that ever
happened to you ever
come on you know it is
coffee with scott adams cannot be better
and if you'd like to take it up to the
next level
pretty sure you do
what do you need
well you need a cup or a mug or a glass
of tanker jealous just like a canteen
joker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it boost your antibodies go
yeah
yeah
well what's new
rasmussen uh did a poll
and it asked first to ask people who
they voted for in 2020
45 said biden 48 trump
but don't do what i did
and say wait a minute
if if this is a survey of the people who
voted
doesn't that mean trump won
because the survey of people who voted
shows trump won
but
hold on hold on hold on so i checked
with uh rasmussen before i got out here
uh and this has more to do with how they
change the weightings
so the you know they the polls do a
weighting of how many people they assume
are democrats and the general public etc
and they they tweak that so this this uh
this has more to do with the tweak of
the weightings than it does with who
actually won
um
but more interestingly rasmussen asked
likely voters
who were representative of the public at
large
who would you vote for today
so if trump and biden both ran which
seems deeply
unlikely to me but if they ran against
each other in 2024
or actually if today so maybe it would
change by 2024 but as of today
biden would get 32 percent of the votes
trump would get
45.
start the local stream so the local
stream is started
uh and i'm i'm on it live right now but
i did have a technical difficulty and
it's possible that it shows up as two
posts
so uh skip the one that's not active and
go to the one that is if it looks like
it's not working
um and how many and but so this looks
like
good for trump right 45 would vote for
him compared to 32 percent for biden but
number one he's not going to be running
against biden
right
he's not going to be running against
biden
uh but
56 percent of those polled in the
christmas and poll here
said it would be a bad idea for trump to
run
even though according to the poll he
would beat biden if by if no in the
unlikely event that biden were the
other candidate
he'd cream them and people still don't
want him to run
is that
rational
that they would vote for trump over
biden but they still don't want trump to
run
it's a little bit rational
because they would also vote vote for
you know some other republican over
biden and then they wouldn't have the
the controversy that they might have
with trump
um jobless claims are the lowest since
1969
when the
population was far less
that's a pretty big deal
so
one of the things that keeps surprising
me
is that our ability to hire people is
pretty strong
like really strong
let me give you my economics lessons of
the day
if you could only measure one economic
statistic
and that was all you had to know if the
economy was going in the right direction
or the wrong
direction what what one measure
would you look at
um
so if you're having trouble on locals
just uh restart the app i'm seeing some
people are getting some trouble the app
is working it's just
getting a little rickety right now
i would say the most important economic
indicator and i do have a degree in
economics so i'm not just
spitballing here
is employment
generally speaking when your employment
looks good
everything else works
that's a pretty good general statement
now of course there could be other
shocks and surprises in your economy
you know inflation could be high and all
that stuff but if you could just measure
one thing it would be the
uh the employment and that's really good
it's looking really good
all right
so you think m3 would be the
well that would be an interesting
conversation
wage push okay well there's obviously
lots more to the economy than employment
but that's the big one
so
here's a question that i think a lot of
you
wonder about but maybe don't ask
directly
what's it like to be rich does anybody
ever ask that question to yourself if
you're not rich some of you are
how many of you wonder what it's like
do you ever do you ever think
is that as good as it looks
all right well some of you do so i
thought i'd give you a little flavor for
what it's like um you know because i'm
i've had a successful career so i've got
a good deal of money right now
and let me tell you what it's like
number one
you can if you're a couple
you can both have a nice car
which is pretty good
so christine and i both have
nice automobiles
both of them were damaged this week
so both of them are in insurance and in
the shop which is normal normal when you
have when you have nice things you got
to take care of them
so christina's car was damaged and my
car was damaged this week
interestingly neither of us were driving
those cars
both cars were damaged
neither she nor i were driving either
car
that's the way it goes
but so we have two nice cars we can't
use them because they're they're damaged
i do have a a very nice house
and that's that's something that a lot
of people
would wish they had
so my very nice house at the moment uh
just had its uh i think the 11th
major water leak this week
the 11th there were two this week
one with a sprinkler system
one with the indoor
what are called warm floors they run
warm water piping through the floors if
you get a leak in one of those it's a
bad it's a bad thing so i've had about
11 major water leaks so i spend part of
almost every day
trying to fix a water leak
i know what you're thinking you're
thinking is there some kind of
construction problem
no they're all completely randomly
different
and they have nothing to do with
anything
they're completely random
now again i i
i also get to live in a nice
neighborhood
so that's that's something you don't all
get to do and i'm quite aware
of the benefits of that for example one
of the benefits of living in my
neighborhood is that
both of my adjacent neighbors have both
been burglarized
by bands of people who broke through the
windows at night
and
in a small gang
uh took everything that they could take
that looked valuable
now that's happened to both of my
neighbors
so i assume that i'm next on the
list case case any potential robbers are
watching
my home will be a little bit harder than
the neighbors that's all i'm saying
you just better make sure i'm not home
[Laughter]
if you break into my house
be pretty sure i'm not home
that's my only advice
because otherwise it's going to get wet
all right here's some other advantages
of
you know being well off
a lot of people don't have enough money
even to pay for
heat
but i do
and i wish i had heat today
because if my warm floors had not leaked
it would feel great right here instead
of cold like i am right now but in
theory the theory would be good now i
could also buy nice computers my
computer wasn't working this morning
which is why i was late
i also have a number of cool systems in
the house
for example there's a system called an
elon system
where you can control the lighting
everywhere
now that doesn't work
obviously
so
uh it's really just an expensive system
that puts things on the wall that tease
me
wow if that worked
imagine if you could push those buttons
and like the lighting would
do different things that would be cool
so i have that and you don't have that i
mean you turn on lights exactly the same
way i do
but in theory i have a very complicated
system that would do that for me
now i also have and i'm actually a
little embarrassed to say this
i have 14 televisions
i know
it's kind of a douchebaggy thing to tell
you isn't it
i have 14 televisions
none of them work
i have zero televisions at work
because they all go through a central
processor which doesn't work and it's
hard to replace
so i have no televisions at work now all
those televisions have their own remote
controls
and unlike a lot of people who are
struggling
my remote controls and again i know what
a douchebag this sounds like
each one of them cost a thousand dollars
that's how good the remote controls were
each one was a thousand dollars because
it did a lot of stuff it wasn't like a
regular tv remote now 100 of them broke
it turns out that if you drop one of the
remotes
the little uh thing that allows the
charger to charge
falls off
and then because it was a kid who
dropped it
they see that thing on the ground and
then they throw it away
so all of the thousand dollar
remotes became useless in about two
weeks
because somebody dropped them every time
and then threw away the piece that you
need to charge it
so i have no televisions and no remote
controls in theory i have 14 televisions
but none that actually work
now another advantage that
you have with money is that you can take
nice vacations
and that's a really big deal and i
and i'm always conscious of the fact
that not everybody can do that so when i
get to take a nice vacation
i'm very very
thankful for it for example
um just this week uh christine and my
wife found out that we had she'd
forgotten we'd booked a luxury trip
to a you know very high-end hotel
and um
we forgot
actually forgot we booked it
i mean i didn't know about it at all but
she forgot she booked it and so it was
too late for me to go so christina went
on her own
and enjoyed a really nice
luxury vacation
while i was working seven days a week
but here's another good thing that you
can do if you're well off
and this is like the ultimate luxury
um
and again it's embarrassing even to say
because
if you can't afford this it's going to
make you feel bad
but you wondered what it's like to have
have money so i'll tell you we sometimes
do these things called a couple's
massage
where you'll have two massage therapists
come over and do a couple's massage
well christine ordered one of those last
night
and i gotta tell you it was great
not for me i didn't have a massage
but christine and her sister had a
massage and i helped set up the tables
for those so that was great
um
i had some other things to do that night
i had to do some driving which i
couldn't do because the massage
therapist parked in front of the garage
door
so
while christina and her sister were
getting excellent massages i heard they
were terrific
i was swearing at my driveway
and eventually drove my car over a curb
damaging it a little bit
uh just to be able to get out of my own
 driveway
now
today
in about 10 minutes
i'll have a worker here to look at the
warm floors and maybe fix that
and then for the rest of the day i'll be
listening to jackhammers
so jackhammers all day and all week
actually and the jackhammers kick up so
much dust
that pretty much everything else i've
ever purchased has been ruined with dust
this week
so if you're wondering what it's like
to have money
it's probably not nearly as good as you
think
it's way better than not having money so
let me be clear on that if you had if
you ever have a choice
take the money
but it is not nearly as good as you
think
i promise you
is not nearly as good as you think it is
now that's just a weird week i thought
it was funny that that week turned out
this way
all right
here's something that i fear
are you watching the uh kim kardashian
who's dating uh
pete davidson from saturday night live
and they're doing it kind of you know
publicly and you wonder how
kanye who no go who know now goes by yay
you wonder how he feels about that
and i have to admit
i do live in continuous fear that my
wife will someday leave me and date pete
davidson
now i don't know if you have any
if you've ever had this fear
but every day i look at this and think
well that could have been me
that could have been me
and somebody on twitter i forget who
gave me this joke so this is not
original
but
[Laughter]
somebody said of pete davidson why would
you date someone who has more pathogens
than the wuhan lab
[Laughter]
that's pretty funny anyway
um
pete bonagez
is working on putting in all those uh
electric car charging stations as part
of the
infrastructure bill
and he said that you need these charging
stations in two places
that don't get mentioned much which is
in urban areas
makes sense
but also where there's dense housing and
people don't have a garage
you know they're they're in an apartment
or whatever
and uh
i
i'm uh right on board with pete
butterjudge because if there's one thing
that poor people in dense
neighborhood housing need it's a way to
charge their teslas
because
i don't know if you know what the
priorities are for the country
i used to think it was stuff like
feeding the poor and health healthcare
and stuff like that but the poor also
don't have places to charge their teslas
and i don't think
i don't think we could ignore that
so
maybe by the end of the biden
administration the poor will be able to
charge their teslas
and that's good news all right i'm just
kidding
it's not just the porn it's not just
tesla's
i get it i get it but it's funny to
imagine
that they're so out of touch that
they're giving tesla charging stations
to the bore
um here's a simulation update
um one of the things i like to call the
fake news industry is a rotting house
it's like a house that's
rotting
isn't it
and what are the odds
that the rotting house would make up a
bunch of false claims about
kylo rittenhouse
so it's the rotting house versus the
written house and uh
do you think that the left is finally
figuring out because i'm seeing
anecdotally a number of people on
twitter saying well i used to lean left
and i voted for biden but this
written house thing has taught me that
all the news is fake and now i'm gonna
vote for trump
well i don't think they're actually that
many people in that camp
but
maybe
i mean
i believe that in 2016 everybody in the
right learned that the news was
completely made up
now some say they learned it earlier
weapons mass destruction you know bush
etc
and i think that maybe that was
i'll tell you my own view when the whip
weapons of mass destruction thing
happened
i thought it was an anomaly
did you
when when we were bamboozled by the
press into thinking that
iraq had weapons of mass destruction
how many of you thought that was sort of
a one-off
versus the way everything works all the
time
because
i i
i tried to remember if i if i believed
there were weapons of mass destruction i
think i did i don't remember exactly but
i probably did because why wouldn't i
yeah and and at the time i thought to
myself well you know
thank you james
um
at the time i thought to myself
well you know i guess something happened
here but this is not the way it normally
is right it's not normally that the
press just makes up a story
but it is
it's completely normal
and it took a while to figure that out
and the the trump administration
proved to anybody who supported trump
that the news was completely fake but
now the left is at least getting a taste
of it
they're just getting a little taste of
it and i think that they're also
understanding that everything has been
run through a race filter
and it shouldn't be
because we're seeing so many cases now
that
don't look like race at all
that are being called race the written
house uh situation was being called the
race thing it wasn't
it wasn't
um
so over at the uh daily beast uh which
is they pretend to be journalists but
it's basically a
gathering place for trolls who think
they could write
so the
the house of trolls
called the daily beast
uh was getting on
two people tim poole and andy no
because they were identifying the
waukesha
attacker the one who was in the car and
drove over all the people in the parade
they correctly identified that his
social media showed him he was a blm
supporter
and uh they reported on that
and what happens when
uh
and and also that uh he was anti-white
explicitly he wasn't just pro-blm
which you know many people could be he
was actually just anti-white and and he
said so and white people should be
unhurt
he basically said that directly um and
of course that is part of the story
right because he ran down a bunch of
white people
so if your social media says
he's recommending hurting people white
people and then he hurts a bunch of
white people that feels related doesn't
it
doesn't that feel at least it should be
part of the story
well that's what tim poole and andy know
said but
the daily beast
decided that they were trying to make it
racial
what
you know who tried to make it racial the
guy who posted those social media
attacks against white people that kind
of made it racial
now how about this one this is cnn
trying to make the uh the defense
uh
for the arboree case
um they're trying to turn that racist
too
so
here's the report on cnn here's how cnn
says it on monday defense attorney
laura hogue when it went as far as to
say during your closing arguments in the
case quote
turning a mode arbory into a victim
after the choices he made does not
reflect the reality of what brought a
mood arboree to satilla's shores in his
khaki shorts with no socks to cover his
long dirty toenails
and so
she is being accused of being racist
for suggesting that this individual
ahmad arbury
had khaki shorts with no socks to cover
his long dirty toenails
and so i said to myself
wait a minute
what's the race part of that
like there's a claim that that's racial
but i'm looking right at it
i don't even see race mentioned
and so i said to myself
i said to myself
he says he isn't a jogger
well that wasn't the point they were
trying to make on this statement but
yes i don't think you jog in uh
in khakis and uh
uh
and no socks and wearing uh what um
sandals
no socks to cover his long dirt yeah i
must add sandals
anyway that's a pretty good point that
he wasn't there as a
jogger in any traditional way that
joggers jog but i asked on twitter
suppose i were to describe somebody out
of context and just said that it was a
person with let's say a man with khaki
shorts and no socks to cover his long
dirty toenails if that's the only thing
you knew
what ethnicity would you assume
was wearing the khakis
with the long dirty
toenails
you would think
white yeah i think 71 of the people who
answered it said uh white
because khaki shorts and
and sandals
so this is cnn trying to make literally
anything a racial
thing um
i saw a comment from uh twitter user
uh sierrano
regulate i don't know how to pronounce
his name
who is claiming that cnn is not nearly
as bad as fox
if you're talking about fake news oh my
god
says this user
cnn's not as bad as fox and then he went
on to say
and it's it's so obviously
probably not the same he said
who's you know in the asked this
rhetorically
who's the tucker and graham uh judge
judge nean or guffield on cnn
right
like where on cnn
are you gonna find somebody like a like
a talker carlson or laura ingraham or
judge nene or gaffield yeah sean where
where on fox are you going to find
somebody like that
to which i said
look for the ones that still believe the
fine people hoax was real and the people
who still think that trump suggested
drinking bleach
find them
that's what we're talking about
but the trouble is
that
ciaran
probably doesn't know those are foxes
so if you are so bamboozled by your
press that you think that the ridiculous
hoaxes that they're showing you are news
are real
you would come to the belief that cnn
was giving you real news because how
would you know
everybody else says it's real on the
news that you watch
you'd have to watch other news to find
out it's not real
all right so it's amazing how
bubblicious
some people can be
um
so uh
[Laughter]
apparently there's some serious talk at
comcast
about joy reid's future at
msnbc so the executives are saying ah
should we keep joy reid in her current
job at msnbc
and i have some advice for them
in my capacity as the creator of the
dilbert comic
now sometimes i comment just
as a observer of politics but in this
case i'm going to comment
uh as someone who has a long history of
observing corporations
and how they work
and here's my recommendation for a
comcast as a corporation
and i'll just put this out there they
can do with it what they want
based on my experience living in the
world
i think it's a bad idea
to have an over racist
as part of your brand
now i know i know
it's shocking
but if somebody is clearly and obviously
and is not even trying to hide it
says it right out front
is a full-on racist
i'm saying my advice would be don't use
them as your brand ambassador
is that too far
does that advice seem
seem pretty solid to you or no
i'm basing it on all of my business
experience
that using a racist as your brand
ambassador
probably doesn't help you sell product
does it
no well it's good that they're talking
about it
anyway as you know uh kyle rittenhouse
was famously photographed at one point
with the proud boys
uh apparently the story is his lawyer
that he eventually fired who was the
worst lawyer in the world except for his
other lawyer the other first one that
was fired not his eventual lawyers who
got him off
on all charges
who apparently was a good lawyer and
so the bad lawyer
tried to get him a meeting with the
proud boys at some bar
when kyle didn't exactly know who the
proud boys were actually he didn't even
know they were the proud boys he just
thought it was a bunch of guys who work
construction
[Laughter]
and so he posed with them he did the
okay sign didn't know it meant anything
uh
and then he blamed his attorney for that
now does that sound convincing
does that sound convincing that that's
that was his entire association and by
the way he condemns the proud boys
he condemns them in direct language
yeah it does sound real because he was
17 and he had a really really bad lawyer
apparently like as bad as the baddest
lawyer could ever be
all right
have i told you that i'm connected to
every story even when i don't want to be
and it's just weird like i have weird
connections to stories sometimes
directly sometimes indirectly
several years ago when
um
anybody who supported trump was getting
uh
um
okay
got a tv recommendation there sorry
about that
and uh
so anyway i was doing some speaking uh
during that time and i i wound it down
because it was just too dangerous to
speak in public during the trump
administration because i just didn't
feel safe and i was contacted by a
member of the proud boys
and this member of the proud boys who
sounded like he could reasonably speak
for other proud boys at least locally
said that they would be happy to provide
security for me
you know i don't know they didn't say
anything about charging me but they said
they could
they could provide security for me if i
wanted to go to berkeley and give a
speech
now i said to myself well that wouldn't
be one way to make things worse
so because i'm not 17
i said to myself thank you
and i actually appreciated the offer
and i respectfully uh declined his
respectful offer
um but
that's because i'm my age right if i
were 17
do you think i would have known enough
to you know
smell trouble
no
no i would i would probably go on just
like kyle did
so you know it takes it takes a long
time before you can see around corners
but i could kind of see around the
corner on that one
i was like yeah
i don't i don't have a personal problem
with it
but this just looks like it's going to
attract trouble
and sure enough it would have i'm sure
yeah ann coulter used them and
by the way i think that they would do a
good job
and i would also like to say that as far
as i know
as far as i know
either most of the proud boys or all of
them maybe
are not racist
as far as i know
now if somebody else has different
information or if they're actually
members of the group who are actually
racist maybe
every group seems to have some but as
far as i know they're not
but if other people think they are
obviously it's a red flag
yeah
yeah it's
it was originally a drinking club
that just
sort of you know got a momentum of its
own
uh
anyway
so that's all i know about them
um there is a lovely takedown of people
who are bad as statistics especially in
the covid reference by a professor
jeffrey morris who is very very
qualified at this stuff
he is listed as a data scientist
biostatistician
quantitative scientist biomedical
researcher and a cancer researcher so
if you want somebody to look at your
coven graphs and tell you if they're
good
he'd be one
right he has exactly the right
qualifications
so what did he think when he saw some of
these graphs that would show that you
know
more people are dying vaccinated than
not and stuff like that
what did he say
well he did a long
thread a takedown of alex berenson
and his ignorance of statistics
right he named him in particular but he
was talking about people
and bad statistics let me give you an
example
just one example the the one that he
talked about was there's a famous graph
going around
that seems to show that vaccinated
people are
dying more or getting infected more than
other people and he he explains why
you're wrong about all of that
all right now i won't give his argument
because it's better if you hear it from
him it's more credible
but
uh he does do a good job of showing that
the alex berenson kind of things he
tweets are based on ridiculously bad
um interpretation of data like
ridiculously bad
ridiculously bad
let me give you an example
right this is not the this is just
something else i saw in his thread this
was not even the topic he was taking uh
berenson down on
you've heard of the vares database and
has lots of reports uh an alarming
number of reports of people who had
who died or had
reactions after getting vaccinated
um does anybody know how many of them
there are
how many adverse reports are in the
varis database can somebody give me that
number i'll bet somebody knows it off
the top of their head
it's a low tens of thousands or
something
is it under twenty thousand
something like that eight thousand ten
thousand somewhere in that range
six thousand issues so it's under ten
thousand right
but that's a lot
all right
um oh yeah i guess i didn't ask i didn't
qualify deaths versus uh
bad reactions
19k 20k all right
but here here's uh where i'm going with
this we don't know that exact number
but let me ask you this
how many people in the united states do
you think die
every month
how many people in the united states die
every month just of anything
give me your number
how many die every month of any cause
i'm seeing numbers from 8 000 to 400
000.
some say a million
now wouldn't your opinion of how many uh
adverse reactions are in the vares
database
wouldn't that be highly influenced by
how many people you think die normally
so it turns out that 250 000 people
die
every month
[Laughter]
and you would expect if the vaccinations
were perfectly safe and and affected no
one negatively
you would expect a quarter of a million
people to die within a month of taking
it
did you know that
if the vaccines were perfectly safe
a quarter million people would die
within
four weeks of taking it
and how about within a week of taking it
50 000 people
would have died just by coincidence
within a week
of taking the vaccination if you know
somebody who died within a week of
taking a vaccination
they might have been one of 50 000
people who had that experience
it doesn't mean anything
it literally means nothing
now i'm not saying the vaccinations are
safe or that the numbers are accurate
i'm saying that if that's what you're
looking at to determine it doesn't
that's not the place
all right how about this
um so if so he goes on this is professor
jeffrey morris he says if vaccines were
given at a random time
no matter when you gave them you would
expect about 7 000 people to die
the same day
that they got the vaccination
you would expect 7 000 people to die
the same day
that they just got vaccinated by chance
that would be how many would happen by
chance
you see where this is going right the
vares database is not telling you
anything
at all
um and yeah
so
anyway i would say that nearly
everything you see from alex berenson uh
has the same flaw which is that alex is
not as good as somebody like professor
morris
looking at data and so to the lay person
it looks pretty convincing
but to somebody who knows how statistics
work
nothing like that's happening
nothing like that is happening at all
all right
but again all of that could be a lie too
because everything's a lie and we don't
trust anything anymore
um how many of you know what a dao is
d-a-o not the dow jones
how many of you would know what a d-a-o
is
which stands for a decentralized
autonomous organization
right i like to make my viewers smarter
than the average
the dow d-a-o
is something coming toward you
maybe fast
and maybe really big
like
really big
how big
transform the entire economy big
that's how big
all right let me tell you what it is it
could it could turn out to be a blip and
nothing right
but let me tell you what it is
it's people using the blockchain which
is the basis for
crypto but doesn't have to be just
crypto you could use it for other
reasons
well actually it's i guess there's
always a token involved isn't there
if you have a blockchain there's always
some kind of a token isn't there
necessarily i think so
but anyway it's people who self-organize
for a project much the way hollywood
self-organizes for a movie
now there's not a bunch of people who go
from movie to movie and make movies so
much
there might be a director and a producer
and then they hire the people they need
just for the project
well the
decentralized autonomous organization is
a way to do that but without a leader
so there's no leader
so people buy tokens you know they buy
in
to have influence if they buy more
tokens they could get more influence
but
the rules of who can vote and what
they're voting on and and what the rules
are for how things work are all
determined by the group
that so they work it out based on voting
based on how many tokens they own and
it's a way to self-organize a project
where people have complete
visibility of everything you know they
can see other people's work
they can see the rules they can
contribute they can get paid for it in
some cases
and so the thinking is
that if this works in a few settings it
might go big and might even be better
than
corporate governance
depending on the project
maybe a corporation is the worst place
to do it it could be a that a
self-organized
entity like this that organizes just to
do a specific thing
might be exactly the way to do it
so there was a dow a dao that tried to
buy the constitution there was a copy of
the constitution that went up for sale
at uh was it sotheby's i think
and
um so one of these sprung up and there
was no leader it was just a bunch of
people who had a common interest and
they self-organized created rules for
what was what and they bid now it turns
out they didn't win the bid because
that's you know a separate
issue
but if they had won the bid it would be
the most successful dow i think
and could have could have really made
things uh
different
so keep an eye on this this is one of
those things that this is like hearing
about bitcoin before everybody heard a
bitcoin
right this is like hearing about the
internet
before most people had ever heard the
word
all right you're now you're now way
ahead of the public because you know
what a dao is it's a self-organized
thing where all the rules are on the
blockchain so everybody can see it and
you buy into it and you your influence
depends on how many tokens you buy
typically
all right so now you know that here's
something brit hume said about biden
and the reason this is important is
because it's very hume
all right not everybody has the same
level of credibility will you agree with
me
right
if you're listening to one of the worse
than watergate guys they have zero
credibility you know the news hosts
not so much
but hume
is
i think would be
both the left and the right would say oh
yeah he does play it down the middle
like he's actually just a reasonable
person
here's what the most reason you could
argue he's the most reasonable and
balanced
voice for decades
and here's what he said about biden
he said quote in fact i think the thing
we have to watch is the question of
whether
he serves on his first term he's clearly
deteriorating he's clearly senile
imagine the most reasonable person in
the in the news business
just says it directly
this is different
we're now at a level
where people who are not like you know
screaming partisans are just saying oh
that's obvious
he's obviously senile
so angela says
hume is credible lol
i could be wrong
well you are wrong look into it
so if you're saying that because there's
an association with fox news
well i think you're wrong just look into
his background
and much like i say the same thing about
murkonish on cnn
also uh sanjay gupta
there would be two people who appear on
cnn that as far as i can tell
try to actually just look at the facts
and are not like screaming partisans and
fox news says the same
they have a number of people who are
absolutely not partisan in the way that
you know you typically think of it
so uh certainly the opinion people are
partisan but uh
to me this still feels like a
um an important
you know notable
thing in the biden story
that somebody can say this just directly
and guess what it's not even big news
think about that
you know how the the left likes to
um they like to boost anything that ray
says that's crazy
so if anybody says anything that's a
little crazy sounding on the right
that's going to be on cnn right
here was
a top
top here at reputation news person who
just called the president of the united
states
clearly senile and he wasn't speaking
hyperbolically nobody would have taken
it that way
nobody would have said yeah i know
you're being partisan you're just you're
just saying that nope
nope that wasn't what happened
that was a matter-of-fact statement he
made a matter-of-fact statement about
the president of the united states being
senile
and
and it wasn't even reported as an
anomaly
it was reported as normal
we actually normalized the senility in
our president
i guess you can normalize anything
i'm seeing some push back here because
of the sanjay gupta
talk with joe rogan
keep in mind
that sanjay did not back his network
you saw it right
when he was asked to defend was cnn said
about the
uh
the ivermectin
he didn't
he said i don't know why they said that
he didn't say it
so he didn't defend it either if you
don't defend it
i think you're criticizing it right
i mean you know we do have to um
you have to
you do have to make some allowance for
the fact that people have a paycheck
coming right
so if sanjay doesn't want to
savage his own network
but he makes it clear that that wasn't
his opinion i'm okay with that like i
don't need him to go
uh i don't need him to go you know
barbarian on his own employer
as long as he says it clearly and he did
i don't know why they did that it's very
clear he wouldn't have done it
and didn't
so yes sanjay gupta is a credible voice
on cnn
if you don't like it go look at it
yourself
gupta defended his investment i don't
know what that story is
does he have an investment in some kind
of medical thing that he reports on
i don't know
uh you're in california and wearing a
jacket this is not a jacket
this is a shirt
it's a shirt
it's an excellent shirt
but yes i have no heat
uh today in my house
i am double shirted
it is a cool shirt so to speak
what's that you're more reasonable than
your fan girls scott
group dandruff plus a few days later he
agreed with don lemon saying it was
horseshoe murmur but not in the same
context all right so i don't have to
look into that to know that you're lying
to me
sanjay gupta
did not say
that ivormectin is only horse medicine
and don't tell me he did if you believe
that just go back and look at it that
didn't happen i don't have to research
that to know it didn't happen
um
well it is also that you're lying to
yourself
am i
am i lying to myself are you reading my
mind
all right
yeah it's colder in northern california
it's probably
52 out
he didn't correct uh oh he didn't
correct well i mean that's a separate
issue isn't it
you know how how much does sanjay gupta
have to correct his employer or his
co-workers
i know as long as his opinion is clear
i don't think he has that requirement i
honestly don't
well i'll give you let me give you an
example i've appeared on fox news
you know a number of times
is it my job
to criticize uh everything else fox news
has ever said because i've i've worked
with them in a in a
you know compatible way
i don't think so i don't really i don't
really feel that responsibility
if i see something i'll mention it but i
don't feel like it's my job to
you know explain the context of
everybody i've ever talked to
you know i think i told you early on
especially in the trump administration i
told you i have i've won
well probably another but one of my
absolutes
is i won't be told who i can associate
with i just won't
so i will talk to
black lives matter i'll talk to a
pedophile i'll talk to jeffrey epstein
i'll talk to
don lemon
no restrictions
no restrictions you know and and by the
way
i'm really firm on this one
really firm
um
you steal guffield's jokes often says
john well he has good jokes why wouldn't
i steal him
if you're stealing from people who have
bad jokes you're doing it wrong
there's no such thing as
anybody who deals with humor who doesn't
steal jokes
you know that's not a thing right
and usually it's not intentional
sometimes you just see a good joke and
you want to repeat it
but i mean it's not really it's not a
reasonable comment that people steal
jokes
um everybody steals everybody's jokes
there's nothing wrong with that
uh and greg and i are friends so we
generally agree on stuff often what you
think is we're saying the same things
sometimes we've actually talked about it
the topic beforehand and we're just on
the same page
should we start it now
if you had a reason
how to open kitty friskies with your
bare hands
all right
there are only nine plots in literature
it seems like fewer
all right i'm pretty sure i'm gonna have
to go figure out
what's going on right now
greg just texted me
what do you think of foundation oh if
you're if you want a good sci-fi show
on apple tv i think that's the only
place you can get it um
if you want a good uh
show foundation
i'm really enjoying it
and the thing i like about it is the the
the concept level
at the concept level it's just it's just
mind-blowingly good and there's one
scene in there i won't describe it where
they let's say the bad guy
just so it's not a spoiler
where the bad guy does something so bad
that i've never even seen anything like
that even in literature
like a level of bad
that i don't know could ever be topped
by any book or
it was so bad
it's just the baddest thing i've ever
heard of
and anyway if you read it you know what
i mean
um
uh
[Music]
if ridden house hadn't shot and was
subsequently beaten or killed would they
have been would you would the killers be
charged
i don't know
don't know
will the mob robbers go for
so you know what's happening with these
flash mobs robbing stores right
so in the bay area it's happened a
number of times already the big group
will go in all at once and then rob the
store and run away
how in the world
is retail going to survive the the
upscale stuff because i can't see a
chanel store surviving from this point
on can you
wouldn't every chanel store get robbed
i don't think that it'll even be a
i know it just seems like such a uh
such a good odds for a crime
because if they come in with you know 50
people
the odds of you know
more than 48 of them being caught
or the odds of many of them be caught
are so low
it's actually a pretty good business
model
and i don't and guns are being taken
away as quickly as
you know stores are opening so
i don't know the guns are going to solve
it
yeah
you could almost imagine that amazon was
behind the the flash mobs they're not
but
you you could if you wanted to take it
to full conspiracy
you'd say hmm maybe amazon's behind this
because it sure is good for their
business
i certainly if i had a high-end store
would probably just close it at this
point because i don't see anything that
would change the trend do you
because the people doing the stealing
wear masks so the video doesn't matter
the police are
being defunded and probably don't care
how many chanel bags get caught or
grabbed
office space had the whole hypnosis
thing i don't know about that
watch the money heist
there's an amazon leak i haven't heard
about that yet
hi
are you the proud boys to guard your
chanel store now that would be
interesting
except you know any garden would be
overwhelmed
so
i i think it would be very dangerous to
be an armed guard if 50 looters decided
to ascend descend on your store because
they're not going to leave you alone
right the first thing they're going to
do is take out the guard and it's not
going to be nice
all right i think that's all i got for
today i've got to go do some other
things and i will talk to you
tomorrow
