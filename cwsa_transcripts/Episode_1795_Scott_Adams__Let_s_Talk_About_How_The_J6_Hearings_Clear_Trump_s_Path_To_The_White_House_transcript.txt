a little technical problem with my
lighting system today
but i think you can deal with it just
turn down your
turn down your light on your side it'll
work believe me
and suppose you want to take this up to
a level that has never been experienced
in the history of civilization
you can do that yes you can i have faith
in you and all you need is a copper a
mug or a glass tank your jealous steiner
canteen jugger flask of a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine
hit of the day
it's the thing that's going to make
everything better
do you feel it it's already starting
it's a simultaneous sip go
oh yeah
oh yeah that's good
that's so good
well how many of you caught my surprise
man cave
locals only subscribers
uh live streamed last night
in which i taught men
how to please their women using some
tricks that only hypnotists know
only hypnotists now and that's why you
wish you were a member of the locals
community
because the people who saw that uh
have a much happier life today
all right
so somebody mentioned that the patriar
front
uh looks like a best buy employee strike
during a pandemic
think about it
think about the patriot front they're
wearing the khakis and the blue
and the blue shirts
and they're wearing the masks
it looks exactly like a best buy
employee strike during a pandemic
that's not really probably the image
they wanted to
tom that's not true
there are many more variables than that
um
so i'm being a challenge here because
i'm a recent divorcee
and therefore what would i know about
pleasing women
well
i don't know if you know this but
divorces have more than one variable
i don't know if you can do that
but it turns out
that sexual satisfaction is one of many
variables one of many variables
anyway
more importantly finland has discovered
how to make a battery out of sand
hello
we have plenty of sand
now you can make a battery
out of sand
and the way you do it is use the sand to
store heat
so the fins have a working the world's
first fully working sand battery
which can store a green power for months
essentially it just stores heat
and then you release the heat in the
winter when you need it
but doesn't it seem to you that you
could also make a
what's it called a sterling engine where
you take advantage of the
heat differential
that would work too right just use the
heat def differential so probably there
are two ways you could make energy out
of that they're using one of them
but think about that suppose all of your
winter heating problems were solved by
pumping the heat that you have too much
of in the summer
into the sand
it feels like we can make that work
doesn't it
because the sand is cheap and it doesn't
seem to be any
special sand
you could use a thermocouple too okay
i don't know what that means exactly but
but we have a lot of engineers watching
this and i'm sure you know what it means
so the big news is there's
somebody who shot a bunch of people
um i'm opposed to giving publicity to
people who
are mass shooters
uh how many of you would like me to skip
this story
in the comments just totally skip it i
have some comments to make but they're
not terribly important
skip it all right locals people say skip
it
boom
you just solved one of the biggest
problems in the
world do you see what happened
you just asked me to skip the story
because you know it's better for the
world
and now i'm going to do it because you
asked me
so i suppose cnn did that
what if cnn literally did what i just
did say look we're going to ask our
users we think this is a public interest
story
but honestly we don't know if we're
making the world better by reporting it
so we're going to ask you
would you like to see reporting on this
kind of topic or should we just hit the
facts
hit it once and move on
what would the public say
i think the public would say just what
you're saying
if if you just give the public the story
they'll consume it because it's what's
on tv
but if you ask them
would you like to see us cover this
extensively or just you know give you
the facts
pretty much
i'll bet you almost everybody maybe 95
percent
would say you know let's just not cover
it i like the fact i need to know what
happened that's important but just
that's it
so maybe you just solved it
you may have solved it because there's
thoughts that this one may have been an
attention seeker that's all i'm going to
say
i'm also going to say that his last name
i'm not going to mention it but it is
suggestive
that he would do this
the fact that somebody's last name is
suggestive of his future
just it blows my mind because it feels
like the it feels like the
simulation
stopped winking and now it's just
putting it right in your face look i've
been weaking at you forever that this is
a simulation now i'm just going to put
it right in your face right in your face
see if you notice
all right well i will say one thing
generally about shooters without talking
about this particular one
jack basabek tweeted that here's a fact
that at least 37 school shootings and or
school-related acts of violence
have been committed by those taking or
withdrawing from psychiatric drugs
now 37 unfortunately is not the full
list of school violence so first of all
i don't know what percentage it is
but
let's say it's a lot you know whatever
percentage it is it's just too much
do you think
that this connection that so many of
these school shooters
were on psychiatric drugs do you think
that means that the psychiatric
are drugs
indication
or in other words that the drugs cause
the
the violence
because you know a lot of these drugs
have warnings on them about
suicide
and
you know irregular behavior that might
be a side effect so what do you think
do you think the fact that so many of
the shooters
were taking these drugs or just getting
off them
do you think that's a problem
i see absolutely yes
i see some no's
interesting we're looking at the same
facts
and yeah you're you're interpreting them
differently
all right let me let me help you out
let me help you out
uh hear some related news and see if
this helps
this is a fact
the vast majority of people who get
cancer diagnosis
in other words the doctor says you do
have cancer it's been confirmed
those people are far more likely to die
of cancer
than the people who did not get a
diagnosis one way or the other
now
does that prove that the diagnosis is
what kills you
because almost everybody who got a
diagnosis of cancer died of cancer
those people who were never diagnosed
with cancer
were much less likely to die of cancer
so it's the diagnosis that causes the
death right not the cancer
does that make sense
because it happened before the death
so if there's something that happens
before the death on a regular basis it's
like we always see this before this guy
dies
this must be the cause of the death
right
or
or
or
it's the most obvious thing in the world
that you're more likely to die of cancer
if you have cancer
maybe you're more likely to
have cancer if you're one of the people
who have a confirmed diagnosis
so let me ask you this who is more
likely to get a psychiatric drug
um from a doctor
what what type of person generally
speaking is more likely
to get a high-powered psychiatric drug
could it be somebody who looks like they
need it
probably people look like they need it
now if you were to look at the class of
people who look like they need a strong
psychiatric drug
and you compare that group of people
with or without the drug
actually in their body you compare the
people who look like they should be on a
strong psychiatric drug according to
doctors
to the group that no doctor thinks
should be on a strong psychiatric drug
which one which which of those two
groups
would you guess
is more likely
to become a mass shooter
now let me be
super clear here i have a lot of
suspicions about these drugs
and i'm really really curious
if they are causing any problems
because they might be
so if you think i'm ruling out the fact
that the drugs might be the source
problem for a lot of these i'm not
i'm not even i'm not even ruling that
out a little bit
because as a hypothesis is very strong
but if you think that you you know
anything by looking at the rate of
people who are shooters
and also on these drugs or getting off
of them that doesn't tell you anything
right so that statistic
of how many people are on these drugs
tells you nothing it just tells you that
it's a class of people
that you would probably diagnose a drug
to too if you were a doctor
right
so
let's keep that straight
um
here's uh
something that's really interesting
so
the washington examiner which
you probably all know is a conservative
publication their editorial board just
has came out strongly against trump
running for reelection
and they basically think you could get
some trump policies without the trump
baggage if you will
so that's pretty uh
and they use the cassidy hutchinson's
testimony
uh as sort of the trigger to say that
trump trump is done
because the hutchinson testimony now
whether or not hutchinson was telling
the truth and apparently we'll learn
more about that there's some more more
witnesses coming
whether or not she told the truth
i'm not sure that that would be the
reason that
trump shouldn't run
and then i've heard other people say
well
whether or not there was a crime there's
a pattern of behavior that clearly is
disqualifying
to which i say
haven't you made a big
assumption everything depends
on whether the election was actually
rigged or not
but also separately but also related it
could be separately or it could be
related what did trump
if he genuinely believed the election
had been rigged
everything he did makes sense
and and if if it had turned out that we
had found some rigging in like 24 hours
and
and and trump had been proved right and
the election was reversed what would you
think of all the things that he's
reportedly reportedly had done
yet
to take the artificial not true scenario
i'm not saying this is true they're just
saying just play through in your head
imagine if the election had been rigged
trump had been right
and then everything he's accused of he
did
let's just say he did it all
how would you interpret his actions if
he had been right
hero
hero
if you had heard that he took the wheel
out of the hands of the secret service
agent and strangled him to make him
drive
maybe let's say succeeded and allowed
him to drive to the
protest and then the protesters
succeeded in delaying the vote and then
improbably because i don't think this
would be the case but probably just do
the thought experiment
suppose they found a problem
and it actually reversed the
the race and everybody got to look at it
and they said oh
he was guessing but he guessed right his
instinct was right because trump was
guessing right he wasn't acting on
data he was he was saying this looks
wrong
smells wrong there's something wrong
here
now
if he was completely wrong
he's that's disqualifying
because he's wrong on something so
important and he didn't back down on it
that's pretty big
so i would say if somebody if somebody
were of that opinion
that he was acting in what he thought
was the truth but he was just wrong
and he acted that way
yeah i can see how that would be
disqualified even though even if there's
no crime
if if he thought
he actually lost the election and was
trying to hold power anyway well that's
clearly disqualifying but there's
literally zero evidence of that
none
there's not even an allegation of that
there's nothing to support that
hypothesis nothing
and and this is a pretty big you know
hearing so
you'd expect something
but here's what's going to happen
in the process of demonizing trump
i wonder if desantis is getting a free
pass
that he definitely would not get
if he were the unambiguous front runner
for the nomination
because the democrats would be going
after desantis hard
if they thought he was the the main guy
but because trump still exists as a
potential risk
they have to use their energy on him and
then they run out of energy
so trump is an energy monster
and one thing that might be happening
i don't think so
because this doesn't seem compatible
with trump's personality but one thing
you can't rule out
is that trump and desantis already have
a deal
think about it you can't rule out that
desantis and trump have a deal and the
deal is that trump is going to look like
he's going to run until he doesn't
that could be the deal
because that would protect desantis from
most of the attacks
until things get serious and that could
help
and it would also keep trump in the news
it would make him powerful enough as a
media personality to help help desantis
et cetera and do you think that trump
could take credit
if desantis ended up doing some
trump-like policies and got elected with
trump's help
i think he could and i think it would
actually be
quite supportable
if trump took credit for helping
desantis get into the job and finish the
job so to speak
so yeah i would agree with people who
say there's no chance that trump won't
run i feel like his personality requires
that
and and maybe that's okay
i mean maybe it's okay that that's his
personality because that's who i that's
who i wanted to win the first time
i wanted trump the fighter
to be elected president in 2016. and
that's what i got
if you didn't want a fighter i'm sorry
but the people who voted for him or
supported him i didn't vote but the
people who supported him wanted somebody
who would just fight
they just wanted a
an mma competitor and they got one
so do you think you can turn that off
if you got exactly what you wanted
don't think he's going to turn it off
like there's no off button on whatever
trump is
if trump had an off button you wouldn't
trust it would you
right
if he could just turn it off
and just not be trump for a while
you wouldn't trust him because you
wouldn't know exactly what you have wait
is he just going to turn that off he
never turns it off
which in a weird way makes him easier to
trust because you know exactly what he's
going to do
in every situation he's going to fight
every time
he's going to make his case he's going
to push it as hard as he can he's going
to bend the rules if they need to be
bent he might even break a rule if he
needs to
right but
you know he's a fighter
so good or bad
don't you know don't elect a fighter if
you don't want stuff to get punched
there's going to be collateral damage
i've always referred to trump even
before he got elected
i think i started saying that to say he
would be an expensive president
worth the price
but very expensive and in fact he was
very expensive i think
so
we're also hearing the adam schiff and i
think
was it mccain who who was it mccain
who said uh that uh
there might be criminal referrals for
trump
chain i'm sorry cheney blah
okay
cheney
so um
what do you think yeah representative
liz cheney
so she says there could be uh criminal
referrals for trump
and adam chef schiff thinks so too
what would that be for
what would that be for
yeah what crime
have you ever heard of an alleged crime
i've not heard of an alleged crime
how are they talking about an indictment
for something that's not even discussed
have i missed the entire allegation
have i watched the january 6th thing
all this time
and not noticed that there's a
crime involved because i haven't seen
one
are they going to
try him for assault of a secret service
agent
do you think that's going to get
indicted
i don't think so
i don't think so
you really think he grabbed somebody by
the neck while they were driving
really
so this is where you put the really in
there
so the president united states
actually grabbed the neck
of the secret service agent
while the agent was driving
really
really
really
and we didn't hear about it until now
like like nobody mentioned that until
now
really
really
no
no that didn't happen
now i don't know if anybody will testify
it did happen
but let me tell you with all confidence
that didn't happen
right
now
can i be 100 sure
no you can't be 100 sure trump didn't
grab the neck of a secret service agent
while he was driving his car no you can
be 100 sure there are very few
things you can be 100 sure about
this is one of them
if this doesn't jump right out as one of
those few rare exceptions where you can
say you know
i'm not going to give this a 99
this one that's what i'm going to give a
hundred
um
all right
so that's fun watching that
one of the unintended consequences of
this january 6 thing is i believe there
will be no indictments to come out of it
for trump does everybody agree
i see no indictments meaning there'll be
no grand jury who says yes there's
something to follow up on so if there
are no indictments
or let's say there's an indictment and
then it turns into nothing which is you
know would be almost the same
have the january 6 people not cleared
trump of all wrongdoing by their process
would it not be the same as the courts
looking at the allegations of
the 2020 election being rigged and then
the courts looked at the evidence and
said we don't see that evidence
or we don't have standing
and so there's no ruling of any
chicanery
and so the democrats have interpreted
what the court said
about the election
as if the courts are not finding a
problem
the courts have proven that the problems
don't exist
that's illogical but that is their frame
so using the same frame that the
democrats have established if the
january 6 people either don't refer
anything or the and there are no
indictments that come out of it
could you now say that the legal system
um has then by by refusing to take any
cases or none have been presented could
you say at that point that the legal
system
has clear trump of all wrongdoing
because if it's not illegal
it's not wrong
it's just politics
if it's not illegal you might hate it it
might be distasteful wouldn't be what
you did it might be immoral
but if it's not illegal it's just
politics
all right well impeachment's not a legal
process
well i suppose it's legal but it's not
in the legal system
all right
um
surely the
democrats have succeeded in convincing
some democrats that the existence of the
hearing itself means that trump is
guilty of bad things
just as the russia collusion
you know mueller investigation
probably convinced at least half of all
democrats that russia collusion actually
happened
even though
the report said well we didn't see any
right
just the fact that it existed as as an
investigation
half of all democrats think they found
something
even though the report says we didn't
find anything
can't say is not there but we didn't
find any
all right
so one of the weird things is that this
whole thing might rehabilitate trump
because if trump
uh is smart
and knows how to use a story
and he is smart
he does know how to use the story
here's what trump could do that would
absolutely just destroy the narrative
against him
he could say
let's agree
that the courts found that there was no
fraud in the 2020 election
let's also agree
that the january 6 hearings and the
courts have found no crimes on my on my
behalf
so let's leave 2020 behind us
focus on 2024
and let's agree that the courts found no
rigging of the election and the courts
found no wrongdoing on my part
it's a tie
let's go have an election
imagine it
imagine trump releasing on 2020
and saying it's the past
where now we're going to talk about the
future and what else is the past is the
is the
the protests and the the stuff that
happened
you can disavow the violence i'm sure he
has
and just move on
now who knows if trump could ever do
that i think no
that feels like that would be too much
to ask of him given his personality i
don't think he i don't think he lets go
of anything
which also
is why he he's popular he just doesn't
let go of anything
so
but if he did
imagine imagine if he did
imagine if he said what you're thinking
we have questions about 2020
but let's focus on the future we have an
election to win
it would be really powerful
i don't think he'll do it though
now i of course i asked the question on
twitter like what crime does anybody
think that trump is guilty of and the
best example i got was
that he used used the word find when he
talked to
ratzenberger
uh secretary of state of georgia
you only need to find x thousand of
votes
now
if your entire political view
depends on using a different definition
for a common word
the word find
you don't really have much of an
argument do you
well let me say this
when trump says he wants to make america
great again
what i think the word great means is
racist
and you say wait a minute great is just
sort of a common generic word you can't
take a common generic word and then
suddenly decide it's some horrible weird
thing
that that can't be your politics
yeah they can't
they just turned
rigged
if they can turn great into racist
they can
they they can turn fined into lie
i want you to find these votes and then
all the smart people and the democrats
say
i think when he says find the votes what
he really means
is lie that they're really there and
they're not that's what that's what his
his mafia talk means i just want you to
find the votes
or
or
when trump says he wants to make america
great again he just means great
maybe or when he says i want you to find
the votes he wants you to find some
evidence of rigging or some some of the
votes against him were illegal
just go find the problem
and then fix it
so if your best argument is that you
don't know the definition of a common
word
let me try this argument on you
see if it works
um because i'm just extending the
argument that if you don't know what the
the common word
find
or great actually mean
you can just pretend they mean other
things and accuse people of it so
i think you should all mail me a
thousand dollars
and here's my argument you should all
mail me a thousand dollars the argument
goes like this
uh the word grapefruit
means you're all guilty
logic
the word grapefruit i'm redefining it to
mean that you owe me a thousand dollars
and so grapefruit exists
grapefruit is a word
the word means you owe me a thousand
dollars so therefore grapefruit
send me a check
that's the that's the democrats argument
i've taken a common word
i'm going to give it a meaning that
could never have possibly been
associated with that word greatness
equals racism
what
[Laughter]
find equals lie
what
that's not what those words mean
so if you could just make up a word and
then assign a bad meaning to it
you can make anything true
which is what the democrats are trying
to to do
yeah being on time is white supremacy
yeah just words mean different things
now
are you punctual
racist
yeah punctuality means racism
um
so what else is going on
cory booker
uh said this he tweeted that it starts
end of day july 4th to labor day
will you join me go without added sugar
for those days and let's see how it goes
and what we learn about ourselves and
our food system
sign up and find out more
so cory booker
is going after our diet
knowledge i guess
and
says we should test it
test it on your own body
voluntarily
see what happens
now i saw aviva fry commented
because i had agreed with cory booker
and i'd supported his tweet
and viva said don't worry about the
crime-ridden hell holes of democrat-run
cities
people mcdonald's is the real threat to
society stunning and brave
so viva is mocking cory booker for
picking wrong priorities
do you think he picked the wrong
priorities
if you do it by the math he picked the
right priorities didn't he
i would say that the risk of our diet
and our lack of understanding how to
rewrite is a much bigger problem than
the
democrat-run
murder rates and crime rates i don't
even think it's close if you did the
math
am i wrong about that
that if you just if you took all the
emotion out of it just did the math
there were way more people dying and
being tortured to death by their own
weight i would think
so i did the unpopular thing which is i
fully endorsed cory booker's approach
here
so much so that if he keeps acting like
this i could support him for president
how many how many subscribers did i just
lose
let me say it again
this is a really smart guy hold on
let me give you my argument let me give
you my argument
hold on
let me give you my argument it goes like
this what he's presented
is something that you could easily test
and it's and it addresses the highest
priority
if you give me a president who says you
know i'll tell you what i'm not even
going to tell you in advance what my
policies will be
because you don't need to know
what i'm going to do is i'm going to
test in any small way that i can
anything that can be tested
we'll see if one state wants to do
something different with guns
we'll see if one group wants to like
test something with diet
maybe one group wants to do masks and
one does not if that ever comes up again
but i'm going to be the you know i'm
going to be the president who tests
things and if it doesn't test out we
don't do it and if it does test out we
do it
or maybe we do it
so you telling me i wouldn't support
that president
this is the first democrat i've seen
who clearly articulated a system
that totally will work the system the
system is this
voluntary
right he organizes it but it's voluntary
you you do it and then you see how it
worked out and if you liked it you keep
doing it or maybe you learned something
you tell me you don't like that
you give me a candidate for president
who talks like this
talks like this
that's the important part he talks like
this he says if i can test it let's test
it and we're going to go after the top
priorities first
let me ask you i don't i don't know the
answer to this question but what do you
think cory booker's opinion on
public schools and school choices
does anybody know i haven't looked i i
have no idea
what is cory booker's opinion on school
choice
because this will tell you if he's real
um
what
what is it
so you say he's a teacher's union tool
yeah so so let me say this if cory
booker
um supports the teachers unions
and the teachers unions are you know
anti-school choice
somebody says these pro
charter schools here's what i think i
think that someone who talks like this
who knows what an a b test is and how to
test it
would say and this is speculation
because i don't i honestly don't know
anything about his
school choice opinion
but i believe his opinion would probably
be
try it
see what happens am i wrong do you think
that cory booker would be opposed to
what i'm saying right now
well we can't be sure if school choice
or some specific kind will work but why
shouldn't we try it
try it small see what happens
now would you have a problem with that
now i i think somebody said desantis
would do that and if he does that's
great
how would you try it you try it with one
school or one district and see how they
do
so
um don't get panicked there's no there's
not much chance i'll be backing cory
booker for president so don't get too
worked up about it but i'm telling you
that if somebody ever came to me with a
systems approach and ran for president i
wouldn't care what party they were in
first and see if it works approach
because then you don't have to worry
they have uh proposals that clearly
because they don't think through the
human incentive part
but if you test it you don't have to
worry about they thought it through it
worked
or it didn't work
all right uh
let me compare that to michael moore who
does everything wrong
um here's what he's he's tweeted until
women's rights have been fully
reinstated and their equal rights are
enshrined in our constitution
equal rights
well i don't know
is it legal for a man to have an
abortion
i feel like it is equal because neither
a man or a woman
can act differently when it comes to
the child in their body oh maybe men
don't have children in their body but is
that really not treating people equally
if there are only some types of people
who would even commit the crime alleged
crime in the first place
don't we always treat people who can do
crimes differently than people who
can't know
um
and he says uh he i will
this is his threat until women have
equal rights he's talking about roe
versus wade he goes i will not shut up
about this he wrote quote if you invite
me to dinner that's all i'm going to
talk about have me over to your party
and it's going to be dobs dobbs and more
dobs meaning rover suede and i won't
stop until row is reinstated and 51 of
congress is female
i'm thinking to myself
if michael moore was already not the
last person you'd ever invite to your
party
even if you're a democrat if you know
what i mean
uh
he's given us one more reason not to
invite him to his party
and when i read this i wonder i wonder
if maybe the problem is nobody invites
him to anywhere
i feel like he's he's come up with the
perfect cover story
for why he doesn't get invited to
anything
and i'm gonna i'm gonna support michael
moore by doing the same thing he's doing
until women have equal rights
um
i am going to stop dunking that
basketballs
no more
um
and i hope you hear this clearly
i will never
as long as women do not have equal
rights with men
you will never see me
run toward a basketball hoop
take air probably from about the foul
line area leap through the air with my
legs seeming running on the air
stuff that ball down the hoop
i'm not going to do that even once and i
love that i mean that's so much fun i
won't do that even once
until women have equal rights and 51
percent of congress
is female
that is my promise to you michael moore
will not be invited to a party and i
will not dunk a basketball
until the world is a fair place
and that is final
that's final
ah all right
um i'm sacrificing for the cause for the
cause
uh you hear trump is running again
that's what everybody hears
isn't that pretty much the same as an
infantile temper tantrum
no i think michael moore is playing it
right because
he only has one chance to get laid in
this world
and every every guy's gotta
you know make his play
and his play is that he's such a
champion of women
that you're going to need more michael
morris so
maybe you should mate with him because
he will protect you more than you'll
protect yourself
that's right michael moore is making an
argument that michael moore deserves sex
and he'll do anything to get it
including not going to your parties
and
um to me this is more salient than a lot
of you because i was planning a party
and i was gonna invite michael moore
and then he said that like
oh what a boring
party guess to be like dobbs dobbs and
more dobs
that's all he's gonna talk about
no he's not invited to my party he's off
the guest list off i say
he'd be better off watching my live
streams that is exactly right
all right
um is there any way that trump could
lose the election
i think he'd have to do it to himself
now i um
how many of you let's let's do a straw
poll here of my
of my viewers
this will be interesting because the
people who choose to watch my live
streams
almost certainly supported trump in
2016.
so here's my question and you can answer
it with just one of two names
who do you support not who do you think
will win
not who do you think will win
who would you prefer it's not a
prediction it's your preference
would you prefer as the republican
candidate desantis or trump let's assume
both of them are possible go
all right i'm seeing some pompeos
getting there quite a mix
mostly desantis on the locals platform
over on here i'm seeing more desantis
than trump
far more uh well i don't know a lot of
trumps
pretty good mix
um
looks like 60 40.
60 40 for
desantis
am i right if you're just watching the
the votes go by it feels like that
something like that
yeah and i wonder to what extent
this is a reflection of
the voters in general
because my my audience is unique
all right all right well there we go
i believe i have presented you with the
best live stream you've ever seen
highlight of civilization
i know you agree and that's why you'll
be back tomorrow
and
would anybody disagree
right it was the best live stream you've
ever seen in the history of civilization
i know it was
there's your social proof right there
all right
and now
and now
the closing sip
as requested by somebody on the locals
platform
where everybody is special
go
it was only 35 minutes but
that's all i had was it only 35 minutes
i i completely lose a
loose sense of time when i do these when
i go an hour and a half i'm completely
unaware of it i have no idea
it was the best 35 minutes you've ever
seen
um what's your thoughts on rasmussen uh
references to cheating an election
i
i'm pulling back from retweeting that
stuff
and here's the thing i'm trying to
understand
all right so the rasmus poll has a
twitter account
and the twitter account for rasmussen is
even very recently
retweeting
what they would call evidence of voter
irregularities in some key places
now i read the allegations and i don't
recognize them from the news
i don't recognize them from fox news i
don't recognize them from any news
and i'm asking myself why
because there are two things that don't
make sense one is that the the rasmussen
people are paying attention
right they're not making stuff up
they're reporting things that are
reported by somebody
and have at least you know at least
they're raising a flag we don't know
what's true yet
but
the rasmussen
uh twitter account is pretty far out
there
in
in let's say edgy uh discussion about
the 2020 election
now they haven't said anything that
would get them
banned
because they're passing long information
and just you know sort of commenting
riley on it
but
uh
why are we not seeing the same reports
that rasmussen is tweeting
why are they not in the news even the
right leaning news
is it because they're not proving out is
it because that even when the news
sources for the right
look into these allegations they're not
standing up
because that's what it looks like it
looks like neither the left nor the
right are finding them credible
but
but
remember fox news is already in a
lawsuit
about
something that some of his hosts said
about the election
and i don't know how well they're going
to do but i think they've got some risk
i do think they have some risk there uh
legal risk
so we'll see how that turns out
um
anything more tin cringe than a silver
fortune telling and meet the press i
didn't see that
fox is the party of the union party
yeah you know i use fox as just my
proxy for news on the right but i
haven't seen any other news on the right
making big stories about the same claims
that rasmussen tweets
so
so i don't know it could be just a
different risk profile it could be the
rasmussen as long as they don't get
booted off the platform
that's their honest opinion and it
happens to be more you know maybe more
edgy than other people's
the delta tunnel
i don't know anything about that
all right
how many people enjoyed my reading of
the
declaration of independence
you did
oh good
interesting i feel like i feel like that
should be read out loud every year
what do you think
you know it doesn't have to be me maybe
i'll do it every year maybe that'll be
my tradition
because i've never i've never enjoyed
writing
as much as i enjoy the
declaration of independence there's
something about the quality of the
writing
that i think actually made the
revolution succeed i mean i think it's
that strong
um
and i don't think there's a single
author to that right
jefferson was one of the authors
do we know exactly who wrote the good
sentences
i know jefferson was a primary but he
wasn't the only author right madison
somebody says madison but you can see
genius in it
right
john page
lock i guess we're a lot of involved but
but would you agree
that whoever wrote it or edited you can
see genius in it
like it just comes through
do you see it
i mean it's not my is it my imagination
but the actual just
the way they form sentences just screams
screams genius
and not because they're complicated but
because you understand exactly what
they're saying
and they and they use
what are bad sentences well a bad
sentence would be generally one that's
too long
but did you see the size of the sentence
the first sentence of the
declaration of independence is the
longest
you know most
you know most variables you've ever seen
in a sentence and when you get to the
end of it you still know what it meant
it's amazing
you still knew what they said
that's hard
there were products of the enlightenment
do you ever wonder if they were
literally smarter than we are now
i mean i the smartest person in 2020 too
would be
somebody you couldn't even talk to you
wouldn't even recognize them they would
just be smarter than you are and that's
all you knew
but in those days the older days the
smartest people sort of shined
so it does make me wonder if people like
jefferson and madison were actually just
special
and maybe just way smarter than other
people and that's all there was to it
yeah no tech distractions that's part of
it
now smarter just more motivated
have you ever put yourself in the
uh in the minds of the founders of the
united states
do you know what their odds of dying
were or what they thought their odds of
dying were when they decided to stage a
revolution
i remember these are people who are
doing okay
right these are people who had their
their plantations and their slaves and
you know they were doing fine they were
the ones who were going to make money in
this world
and all they had to do is you know bow
to the king in england
and they would do fine
and they decided that they would
risk being tortured and killed
almost certainly tortured
being tortured and killed
to get this thing done largely for other
people and i don't think it made that
much difference to them
and george washington not only
you know joined in but he risked
everything he risked everything
his life everything
and and then they won
but then here's the question on top of
it if we've established
that they were literally geniuses
maybe they knew they'd win
because the whole point of being a
genius is you don't know how they think
if you could think the way they think
well then you'd be the genius too
but you don't know how they think do you
think that jefferson and madison and
washington sat in a room i don't know if
they were ever in the same room but do
you think some of some of them sat in
the same room and said you know
i may be crazy
but
i think we could win this thing
and here's why did that ever happen
maybe it might have it might be that
they were so smart they knew they could
they could win
so don't rule that out
um that bothered you about january 6
what did
your fourth great grandmother signed up
when he was 15. he lied and said he was
16.
so i guess you could be 16 in the
revolutionary army and somebody was 15
and lied to get in
my goodness
yeah jefferson and adams died within
minutes of each other on the fourth of
july
true story
well i don't know if it's true i suspect
it's not true
the whole thing about uh
i guess jefferson died but adams didn't
know it
and then when adams was about to die he
said jefferson still lives
something like that
but i don't feel like
given that our news today is all fake
what are the odds that that was true
well you say it's true but
were you there
you texted
they both hogged on just to make the
date
i know can you do that
andrew jackson fought when he was 14.
uh you never mentioned buddha josh
anymore i don't think buddha jesus is
relevant to anything is he
because all the transportation problems
you know like he's had a transportation
so you say he should be doing something
but correct me if i'm wrong there's
nothing he can do
but a judge doesn't have any tools
does he
he can't make the
oil companies go do something i don't
think he can do anything
all right
um all right that's all for now youtube
i'll talk to you tomorrow
