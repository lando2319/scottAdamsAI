you're only the second technical problem
I've had in the last 10 seconds
so we got bad sound on one platform bad
video on the other but between the two
of them perfect
how would you like to take this
experience up to well levels that I
don't think anybody could possibly
understand
you'd like that
well all you need to do that is to cover
a glass of technical assist iron a
canteen drug of Alaska that's literally
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day I
think it makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous
and it happens now
that's pretty good pretty good I think
everything's back on track now there's a
little bit of disruption at the
beginning but wouldn't you say things
are going perfectly now probably your
house is well as mine
well I was just watching a video of Joe
Rogan talking to a comedian Jim Gaffigan
and it was a fascinating little clip in
which Jim Gaffigan said you know that
January 6th thing was pretty bad
and then he got to listen to Joe Rogan
who obviously is going pretty deep into
the January 6 Rabbit Hole explained to
him the relationship uh between the
intelligence uh the intelligence groups
and the president and the public and
kind of laid out a whole bunch of things
that it looked to me
as if Jim had not ever heard before
now I saw somebody tweeting around in a
sort of a mocking way to Jim Gaffigan
that he'd been destroyed you know Joe
Rogan destroys Jim Gaffigan
it's not what happened
so let me give you some behind the
scenes little behind the scenes story
in case you see that clip you should
watch the clip by the way so it's a Joe
Rogan talking to Jim Gaffigan just
search for it you'll see it
but so here's some behind the curtains
little uh personal knowledge about this
situation
uh several years ago
I was in Vegas and it was with my accent
we were going to a Jim Gaffigan Stand Up
Show
and I had done a TV commercial for
Barnes and Noble years before that in
which uh Jim Gaffigan was the host of
the TV commercial and I appeared as an
author who was in Barnes and Noble so we
spent a day and I thought oh I know him
I know Jim Gaffigan I'll I'll ask if I
can say hi after the show
so we were both not very famous when we
did the commercial so it turns out he
didn't remember me at all I spent a
whole day with him he didn't remember me
at all which is not surprising
because I was a new author and and I
might not have remembered him except
that he became famous pretty quickly
after that so I you know I remembered
him
so
so I sent a note to the uh
you know one of the guys working at the
theater there and said hey can you tell
Jim Gaffigan I want to say hi after the
show
he's thinking he would remember that he
spent a day with me
well he didn't remember that but he's a
really nice guy and he he knew what
Dilbert was so he said yeah come on come
on back after the show
so my ex and I went back and
it was just hanging out with him we just
hung out for about an hour or so
chatting about stuff and here's what I
want to tell you
if you imagine that you just assume he's
on one side in politics and that maybe
Joe Rogan was on the other side and that
they had a you know a conversation and
it looked like Joe Rogan knew more than
he did
that's not exactly what was happening
I I can tell you from my own interaction
that Gaffigan is simply open-minded
that's it that's it he listened
completely
you know when when I told him things
that maybe he hadn't heard before
and
he is just a Seeker I would say he's
somebody who's curious
about politics and it is completely
aware that he doesn't have the whole
story
that's exactly who you want in your
country right so you know maybe Gaffigan
has some politics it leans in some other
way than you do maybe yes maybe no but
you want more of him
he's he's not closed on any question
completely open to listen to fully fully
listen to any explanation on the other
side he's one of the good guys so I
wouldn't I'd hate to see this
characterized as you know somebody beat
him down in this conversation or
something that that wasn't all happening
if you watch it
if you watch it you'll see him absorbing
what Rogan is saying without rejecting
it
that's some good that's like that's
America right that's sort of the America
I want to live in
where somebody disagrees but they fully
fully listen to the other side
incorporate it modify their opinions a
little bit as warranted that's some good
stuff that's the best of us
so I love that
um I've got a new troll response
do you know well maybe you know you
don't get them as much as I do but if
you're a public figure you get the
trolls that come in and just insult you
just nothing else
yeah it's just like ah this guy blah
blah blah blah
so I came up with a neutral response
that I'm liking a lot I'd like to share
it with you
so I tweeted back at one of my trolls
today it doesn't matter who or what they
said just troll stuff
and I said did you wake up this morning
intending to be a useless turd on the
sidewalk of humanity or did it just
happen
I feel I feel like you should borrow
that
a useless turd on the sidewalk of
humanity it's got a 2023 isn't it
you don't want to use some old 1950s
saying when you could update that to a
turd on the sidewalk of humanity
and then just walk away
all right one of my favorite stories
remind me if I talked about this already
Hunter Biden reached a deal on child
support
with his baby mama
in which he would pay some amount of
cash
but then I guess to complete the deal he
also agreed that he would give the
mother of his child some of his artwork
so he'd give us some artwork as part of
the compensation
now
remember when Hunter by Joe Biden said
that Hunter Biden was the smartest
person he knew and you all laughed
he's not the smartest person
that was before he made tens of billions
of dollars overseas and started selling
his paintings for Millions
who's the dumb one now
he might be the smartest person you know
he's not in jail
he's lived his life on coke and hookers
which apparently he enjoyed quite a bit
and he's still making million dollars
and he's still free
if he's not the smartest person you know
who's doing better
I know maybe you don't want that
lifestyle but maybe he does
maybe he had exactly the life
that he wanted and so far it's working
out great I don't know just putting that
out there but here's the funny thing
imagine negotiating with your ex and you
say all right I don't want to give you
this cash every month or at least not so
much but here's one of my paintings and
the ACT says uh that's just like a thing
to hang on the wall he goes no
do you know how much they pay for these
1.4 million dollars I sold the last one
for and this one I'm giving it to you
you can sell it
now here's the question
what's the price of a hunter Biden
painting if you buy it from Hunter
and what's the price of it if you buy it
from his baby mama
same
did she get the 1.4 million
because the art is so good
it's so it's so smart of him because he
he can establish he can establish in the
course that the the paintings have value
because he's selling them
right there's a market there's a market
for it but the market is completely
limited to it coming from him when he
sells it don't you think
do you think the baby Bomb is uh giving
out political favors and in return for
solving paintings
I think it's just hilarious that he got
away with that
although I
I would like to add the following
have you seen any uh coverage of his
paintings have you seen the paintings
themselves
there's something really curious going
on about the paintings themselves now
I'm only looking at them on video so I'm
not you know not in the room with them
but
aren't they
suspiciously good
does anybody have that feeling that
they're suspiciously too good
and so I ask you this question if any of
you ever seen a video of him painting
making his own paintings
I know
you know and if you have was he just
like adding a little brush stroke to
something that already existed
does he have a ghost painter
maybe he has a ghost major
all right so here's let's try to do some
predictions
do you remember the prediction filter
the said that reality Elon Musk says
this a lot I say it too that uh the
reality will go in the direction of the
most entertaining outcome as judged by
somebody who's not personally involved
so from an outsider's perspective the
most entertaining outcome
but the Hunter's paintings gives you two
entertaining outcomes
and I want you to tell me which is more
entertaining because I can't decide
what so you got two possibilities
one possibility is that Hunter Biden is
a legit world-class artist
wouldn't that be fun
to me that would be fun
that you you saw you nobody saw it
coming yeah he was this drug addicted
guy with problems but he had some
genuine Talent
and then suddenly it comes out and it's
like the real deal wouldn't that be
entertaining I mean you might want you
know you stole my woman to go to jail
for whatever you think you did but that
would be entertaining I would be very
amused to find out he was in fact a
world-class artist
now let's compare that
right let's compare it to finding out
that somebody else painted all the
paintings
well just some art school graduate or
something
how entertaining would it be to find out
that the paintings were always fake
compared to finding out he's actually a
legit world-class artist which would be
more entertaining
because to me they're both entertaining
I would like both of those
yeah that's a tough one isn't it
I feel like this is the Schrodinger's uh
you know cat experiment either one about
equally entertaining
so
um I kind of I don't know I kind of hope
that the reality is he's a great artist
I I hope that's the reality because you
know it would be a little more
a little more fun
you know faking something is a little
more ordinary
all right what else is going on um
so Trump trump was in the uh
Pennsylvania rally and uh
have you noticed that Trump is hard to
ignore
so he's at this rally and he says Biden
is a dumb son of a and The Crowd
Goes Wild and you know of course that's
the viral you know that's the one that
everybody sees and
how can one person
be so quotable all the time I mean he
does he doesn't go 10 minutes without
something saying something that you want
to roll around in your head you know and
repeat it in your head because the way
you said it
but if you listen to him called Biden
the dumb son of a I would like to
point out the Artistry with which he
presented that
because there are lots of ways to call
somebody a dumb son of a and it
doesn't come out right
but wow did he deliver the line
all right he delivered the line the
secret I think was that he delivered it
as a matter-of-fact statement
here's what would have been wrong Biden
he's a dumb son of a
no no that would look out of control
little screechy little little pleading
week really kind of weak but when when
Trump says it he says it like he's
Whispering it in your ear
yeah seriously he's almost seducing you
he says it so matter-of-factly it takes
you a moment to figure out what did he
just say that
he just says I can't do the impression
of it but it's more a matter of fact he
just says and diet and Biden he's a dumb
son of a
and you just hear it you go was that
just in the middle of a sentence
did he just deliver the president of the
United States as a dumb son of a
did he say that with the same emphasis
as the rest of the sentence in the
paragraph and he did he was kind of
perfect
you know he does not get credit for his
delivery
his delivery of his own lines just
amazing his timing his timing his
wording he's really uh he's really got
that skill
all right so that's really basically the
only thing I took away from the rally
and it's the only thing I needed to
because the you know the little bit of
the larger context is that Biden's not
quite all there and I think that's the
best argument
the best argument is that you can see it
I can see it we can all see it
he's sort of done
I don't know how that loses because the
the Democrats are not going to disagree
with the argument that he's at a
degraded mental state they can see it
yeah they'll argue it but they can see
it so at least they'd be leading with
something that nobody would debate
uh at least seriously
all right so here's an opening that I
think that Biden and his crew are
leaving for Trump
uh as you know they tried to they've
been trying to sell this extreme Mega
thing to make you think oh no those
extreme Magnus because what they don't
want to say is white supremacist every
day
because that's a little hard to explain
when there are a lot of Republicans who
are Hispanic and Asian American and
everything else and black so it's hard
to call uh you know people of color uh
White supremacists so it looked like
they were going for the extreme Mega to
try to you know weasel that
but here's the problem
Biden and his people have uh left
undefined what extreme Maggie is
which means that somebody who's good at
defining things
such as Trump
could simply define extreme maggot any
way you wanted and make it work
and just take it away take it away as an
attack
so
um I've suggested that extreme Mega
would be a great Marvel character
uh who would have one superpower
and the the this super character called
Extreme Mega the only superpower he
would have is not believing anything in
the news or anything the government says
is true
wouldn't it be funny to see a movie in
which there was a character called
Extreme Maga who only had one power
which is not believing
and I mean like he ended up being like
an actual superhero
it's all it took he just had to know how
to not believe and he could
like you know live like a God because
everybody else did so he'd be sort of
like the one-eyed you know person in the
land of the blind
extreme Mega
refuses to believe what the fake news in
the government tells them this is only
power but it's also the only Power he
needs to rule
all right
um as you know this is America so
whenever there's a tragedy we try to
turn it into conspiracy theories and
humor
conspiracy theories and humor starts as
a tragedy
turns into a conspiracy theory morphs
into humor
so let's talk about the tragic death of
Obama's Chef on a paddleboard
oh would you be surprised to learn that
there are some conspiracy theories about
that
well let me tell you about them
now first of all I don't believe any of
them
so my starting point is no
no on all of them however while I don't
believe any of the conspiracy theories I
would like to
I'd like to assert the following the
story is not true
that doesn't mean he was murdered I
don't I don't see evidence of murder so
I'm not going to go there
but
you know this story isn't completely
true right
do you all know that do you know why you
know it's not true can anybody tell me
why you know it's not true
tell me why you know it's not true go
how do you know it's not true
exactly
because it's a story about a public
figure
it's a story about a public figure
and it's in the summer the summer makes
it extra but it doesn't have to be in
the summer
also all stories about public figures
are false all of them how do I know that
well I've been a public figure for over
30 years I've seen all the stories about
me at the very least they leave out key
information that would change how you
think about the story
sometimes it's an intentional lie
sometimes it's bad reporting sometimes
it's out of context
or any combination of those things
but never
will you see a story that has any any
details or complexity to it that's also
true in the sense that you've got the
real picture
now what is true would be let's say if
somebody died in a horrible accident
they are dead
I think that they're probably almost 100
percent right
when they say somebody died
but once you get past just the most
basic fact of a story almost everything
around it is some kind of narrative or
 or just wrong right so here are
the uh the things just for fun again I
don't believe any of this is indicative
of anything real it's just what's
happening
there's a photograph that emerged of
Obama with a black eye and bandages on
one hand
so people are saying my goodness now
what is the most likely explanation from
the photograph of Obama with a black eye
and cuts on his hand what's the most
likely explanation for that
not that he had a fight with a paddle
boarder
now the most the most likely explanation
is it's an old photo
it's an old photo
right isn't that the most likely
explanation
yeah so you know there could be a
hundred reasons that you would have a
black eye
but remember the picture or a fake
picture yeah could be a fake picture or
black eye or something like that so the
first thing I would say is that if you
believe if you believe the picture is
real
I think that's kind of
you're being a little bit gullible if
you automatically assume it's real it
might be it could be a real picture I'm
just saying that I I assume it's not
starting assumption not real then
there's also the story
again that has no backing as far as I
know that maybe one of Obama's daughters
was maybe hanging out with a married guy
on a paddle board there's no evidence of
that
there's none somebody said the paddle
board looked like Obama's and that was
the evidence that his daughter might
have been there that's not good enough
I don't know that there are that many
paddle board types I don't think you can
tell whose paddle board it is by looking
at it
all right
and what if he did have his paddle board
I mean that wouldn't mean anything
either
all right so don't believe anything
about that
uh or anything else about public figures
um
oh my God
I've seen some bad memes go by
how many of you think the paddle board
story has something
like illegal that Obama did like in
reality how many of you really think
there was something illegal going on
I got some yeses mostly no
now I wouldn't I wouldn't rule out that
there's something illegal that went on
but I don't think it was murder
if for example somebody was drinking and
they didn't want that news to come out
you can imagine that all right so here's
uh and then here's my favorite part
about how fake news gets started
how long did it take somebody to suggest
that he was a young healthy man who died
of maybe a sudden cardiac arrest
that maybe he had been vaccinated lately
how long did it take for that rumor to
start
are you disappointed you didn't think of
it yourself
because it happens in the context of
LeBron you know LeBron's uh some having
some cardiac problems and Jamie Foxx
having some cardiac problems and so now
it's the third youngish black guy who
had an unexplained death
sort of suddenly
uh
so brains just automatically go there
but I want to say there's no evidence
for that whatsoever no evidence for any
vaccination thing it's just a natural
thing you expect all the stories start
conflating and yeah so we're about a day
away from it being caused by an alien
the aliens are really from under the
pond they dragged them down something
like that
well
here's the weirdest thing that happened
to me today
uh
so you know how sometimes if you use
Twitter
sometimes you'll tweeze something and
you'll think oh this is a throwaway
tweet
and other times you'll tweet things that
you think are kind of Genius like ah I
think I nailed it this time
and then the thing you thought was a
genius tweet gets no retweets because
everybody just looks at and they go yeah
we thought that too so it's not new
but then you'll do the one that's just a
throwaway
and I guess 1.2 million views that
happened to me yesterday
um
I tweeted this there's an enormous
correcting Force forming
the most ambiguous tweet you could ever
do there's an enormous correcting Force
forming
and the reason I tweeted it was because
I felt it
like I felt the just the feeling
I can just feel it for me and I didn't
know what it was
I didn't know exactly what it was but it
feels a little like dad's coming home
like things went too far and now the
correcting forces come in and the
correcting force is primarily male
right it doesn't mean women are not
involved of course but there's
definitely a thing that we would all
just describe as a male force in a
female Force right we know what it is
when we see it and when when times are
good
these female forces rise because that's
sort of a luxury feeling you know let's
all be nice to each other and I'll share
my stuff and you share your stuff you
know that's good stuff but when things
go wrong
and there's danger
the women typically take a different
role and the men come out of hibernation
they do whatever dangerous and mostly
dangerous things have to be done
and then if they succeed they go back to
Dorman again because you don't you don't
need that male horse so much so what I
feel is a rising male energy
it feels palpable
some of it I think I'm influenced by the
fact that the major candidates are all
male and the Republican candidates who
are very specifically bringing a male
perspective in a good way not a bad way
back into the mix to maybe get us a
better balance because I think we're
just off balance nothing wrong with
female energy nothing wrong with male
energy there's everything wrong with
either one of them being out of balance
you don't want too much male energy
can we agree
too much male energy is a problem but
too much female energy is a problem too
and that's our current problem
not a permanent problem I think this is
all cyclical and pendulum stuff and it
had to happen but it's happening
yeah there's there's definitely an
energy entering the field that you just
feel you just feel it in that 100 ways
um interestingly after I got a one point
I think it's up to 1.2 million views
just saying there's enormous correcting
Force forming then later I tweeted that
male energy is rising
and that had I think that's pushing a
half a million views which which are
very big numbers for my account
um and then something else happened
the same day Elon Musk tweeted uh
equally cryptically and without detail
quote something special coming soon
now I think he was talking about maybe a
Twitter feature
I don't know what he's talking about but
I I feel like there's just this feeling
that something good is happening
so I've got a general feeling that
there's a some kind of positive thing
happening and and maybe we'll see it in
in Twitter Etc I I saw somebody say that
uh you know musk was uh ruining Twitter
and blah blah blah and I always think
how does how does musk ruining Twitter
square with the fact that it's at an
all-time high in traffic
and we can't stop talking about it
that's like opposite of what you see
right
because musk just tweeted their numbers
it said in all is at an all-time high
it's doing nothing but going up
so uh remind me if I talked about this
before I think I talked about it in the
man cave but not here
so musk puts this giant uh X logo thing
on top of the Twitter building in San
Francisco
which uh San Francisco is not happy
about because it seems to be some kind
of zoning building violation
uh but they're having trouble getting up
there to inspect it somehow the
inspectors can't get on the roof for
whatever reason I don't know uh and so
it stays the entire country is talking
about it if I don't know about
internationally but nationally we're all
talking about his big offensive X on top
of the building and we're all arguing
whether we'd like X or hate X or does
some other company have the the
trademark and what's he going to do when
everybody sues him because they have x's
and their names too and all this
this is the most successful
uh rebranding of a pro I've ever seen
number one there's nobody who doesn't
know that Twitter just became X am I
right
name another company that's ever done
this well in making the entire country
at least I don't know about
internationally but making the entire
country completely understand that
Twitter became X we all know it now
now it reminded me of there's a
restaurant entrepreneur in my town
who started a new restaurant see he
opened them and built them up and sold
them in many cases so he opens a new
restaurant he paints it the most
offensive purple color you've ever seen
it's right in the middle of the main
street with the other restaurants and
it's just an eyesore
you drive past that thing and you're
like oh God who did that and immediately
you think is this okay you know did did
the zoning regulations allow this this
horrible thing and of course they did
not so pretty soon it's in the local
Publications and everybody's gossiping
about it and people are saying did you
see that horrible purple building and
when everybody had complained about the
purple building it lasted I don't know
six months or whatever it was I can't
remember so after about six months of
everybody complaining and the city being
you know on their backs and everything
do you know what the owner of the
restaurant did
guess what do you do when everybody
complained
just guess
he repainted it a normal color
It's the funniest thing I've ever seen a
business person do
it was always a it was an OP
he awarded everybody to talk about it
because it was a new restaurant you
spend zero on Advertising every person
in my town was talking about that
restaurant and we all had to go
because everybody's talking about it so
then when you said hey where do you want
to go you want you want to go out to eat
and somebody would say yeah I hear
there's this new purple restaurant let's
go to The Purple Place
so he he dates it back to a regular
color sells it for an enormous profit
because the the business is going crazy
and then as soon as people were were
done talking about the color of the
restaurant you know the business
collapsed back to a normal level and I
think the guy who bought it didn't even
survive
it was like the smartest like
entrepreneurial thing so I I remember
that when I was seeing a musk could do
this do you think that Musk
um believes the X will stay there
or do you do you think he knows there's
a pretty good chance that San Francisco
is going to make him take it down and
he'll end up taking it down
now he might fight us some more because
that's just more of the fun right
remember he has a big budget
so maybe San Francisco finds him uh you
know twenty thousand dollars a month
what if he pays it
what if he just pays the fine every
month twenty thousand a month is cheaper
than advertising
so watching this little dance is
hilarious but remember the dance is not
about the logo
it's not about the logo this is Elon
Musk being the entire marketing and
rebranding department for all of his
businesses and doing it uh laughing at
the same time I mean he's basically he's
doing his rebranding and probably just
like just hilarious and is working
perfectly
and you know what what will the people
who don't understand anything about
business or psychology say
well there he goes again with these bad
decisions
they'll say
all right uh this was a funny report
from NBC news now remember NBC News
uh at least according to people who are
smarter than me
that's a lot of people
um say that NBC News is sort of in the
pocket of the CIA
all right so it's important to know that
when NBC news is saying something
you might be hearing some influence from
the intelligence Community that's what
people say I can't prove it
but NBC news said that the government
the the news that came out that the
government might be in possession of
non-human biological UFOs was met with
surprising apathy online
that's right there was a credible I
guess looking whistleblower major news
that Congress was taking seriously the
the fact we might have downed UFOs and
captured aliens
and NBC News is sort of
I don't know I wouldn't I wouldn't
describe an attitude to it but they're
reporting that the public wasn't buying
it
now I realized that I have not met one
person in my real life who believed the
UFO story
not one
now there might be people who do believe
but I've not spoken
not spoken to one person who thinks this
is true have you have you spoken to even
one person who thinks is true
even one like in person
you know not online but in person even
one person
somebody said yes but most of you are
saying no
do you remember when I told you there's
just a moment ago
there's a huge correcting Force that's
forming
do you see it yet
the fake news
and maybe the fake government I'm not
sure
you know could be looks like to me it
looks like an intelligence op of some
kind
to me there's no way to know but that's
what it looks like it looks like there
was an OP to change the opinion or what
we're thinking about and that America
didn't buy it
they actually saw it for exactly what it
was from the first minute
what's that tell you
it tells you they went too far
too far
the entire public realizes that that's
too far
that they that the UFO thing is telling
us clearly and for forever that the news
is fake and the government can't be
trusted about anything
the everything we've been told about
everything from the government has been
either lies or self-serving
everything
what happens if the public just woke up
because
that's what it feels like
the enormous correcting Force
feels like the entire public waking up
and saying wait a minute
it's almost as if the news has never
been real
that's because the news has never been
real
the news has never been real
not in the past not in the not in the
present and certainly not in the future
there's nothing that's going to make it
real
so if you were if you were building your
world view around what you saw in the
news
you are brainwashed
and we all are to some extent right the
best we can do is you know we're trying
to tread water as fast as we can to keep
our heads above it but the the
brainwashing is massive it's pervasive
it's all the time it's unending
unstopping is the major force in
Civilization
but I feel like people can see it now
I feel as though
the the Machinery is becoming obvious
and to that point watching the video I
mentioned before of Joe Rogan talking to
Jim Gaffigan about January 6.
when you see Rogan lay it out and Rogan
is not he's not talking as a conspiracy
theory he's talking only the things we
know to be true
so he says we don't know that Ray Epps
was anything we don't know that so Rogan
says that directly there's no it's not
proven here what we do know is that he
was clearly instigating and was not
treated like the rest of the people
that part we know the other part we know
is that our Intel people routinely
insert agents to sometimes escalate
problems
and that that's an understood
long-running process
and that January 6 was exactly the sort
of thing
that an enemy of if somebody was an
enemy of the intelligence agencies As
Trump was everybody understood that that
if they use the normal techniques they
normally use then January 6 was exactly
the opposite of what Jim Gaffigan had
been told it was which was an
insurrection
it was actually an OP
if the evidence suggests that we don't
know it but the evidence suggests it was
some kind of an OP
some level you know whether whether the
op part became the important part
or it was a trivial add-on don't know
don't know but what we do know is that
the news is
and we know that our government is lying
and we know that when Congress asked the
head of the FBI or one of the FBI people
um if Ray Epps was working for them they
wouldn't say they wouldn't say no
under oath they wouldn't say no
so that's what we know
so the one thing you can conclude from
that is not you cannot conclude from
that what Ray Epps is
that does not tell you who rayapse is
period right oh I hear you saying period
I apologize for saying period i mock
people who say that but it was just sort
of at the front of my head
it came out sorry
but it feels like the whole country is
getting uh roganized
you know the way the way Jim Gaffigan
was
because Jim you know again Jim
Gaffigan's an open-minded guy he's he
can see the whole field he's listening
to everything and he's open-minded he's
he's actually one of the ones you want
to support
um
mind you just fluencies
I'll mind my disfluences if you mind
yours you mind your own disfluencies
well said though
all right so we don't believe the UFOs
and maybe that will be the thing that
takes the lid off of everything
uh small news here yay is
been reinstated on x
formerly known as Twitter is that true
I don't believe he's tweeted or as we
say now posted by the way I hate that
posted
does everybody agree
so I I get why you wouldn't call it
tweeting
anymore
but posting
now that's too generic it doesn't it
doesn't feel right in my mouth I don't
think that's gonna last
maybe we'll see Moscow had some more
drone attacks than some of them some of
them hit I guess they damned one that
may have fallen and still done some
damage I didn't see any news of uh
deaths but there was a pretty big
explosion caught on cams and I think
this is uh
probably how Ukraine gets negotiations
going
I think Ukraine is probably wisely
making sure that the public in Moscow
doesn't feel safe
and I don't see any reason that they
can't do that
because as long as Kiev has been under
regular tax since the beginning of the
war to me it's completely in terms of
War you know all war is immoral but
within the context of war that is
completely immoral
uh you can attack you can attack their
population Center if they attack yours
if you think it'll work
right because once the other side says
we're going to kill you all if we can
then you can do anything you want
morality doesn't exist when the other
side says we're going to do anything we
can to kill you all morality goes away
that's just survival and if and if they
think their survival helps by
terrorizing civilians in Moscow they
have every moral and ethical
opening to do that
in the context that all war is immoral
it's just not more immoral than anything
else that's going on at the moment I
guess I guess that's a better way to say
it it's all immoral
but it's not any worse than the Baseline
at the moment
so that might actually make a difference
I do think that if the residents in
Moscow feel genuinely unsafe
that that might have some influence on
Putin because a lot of the the rich
people live in Moscow and presumably
they have more influence on Putin than
other other people would
uh Elon Musk again making news about the
headquarters the ex Twitter now ex
headquarters
well that's weird
I just called
the the company that was once known
Twitter as X Twitter
and the new company is called X
so it's the the ex Twitter company
I feel like that covers everything
I think I'm just going to call it you
know the the ex Twitter company
yeah yeah that might work anyway Elon
says that uh
he is not moving out of San Francisco
even when others are you only know who
your real friends are when the chips are
down in San Francisco beautiful San
Francisco though others forsake you we
will always be your friend Elon tweets
uh
they may uh so something tells me that
that tweet is going to cause a SpaceX to
get drug tested again but
just it's just a feeling
it just feels a little bit like
you know
you know
he might have been having some fun that
night
all right
you know the story about the Korean
company that said South Korean company
said they sold for room temperature
superconductivity and if that were true
it would have changed all of
civilization and our technology because
superconductivity at room temperature
could make uh you know electrical
transmission loss free and quantum
computers work better and all kinds of
things that are just gigantic but the
critics waited in and said that's not
true you really can't do those things
and then they said you try it yourself
at home and you'll see and then some
people did and so the the original claim
seems highly
let's say highly criticized
and I would not say that you should
assume it's true
and then the most amusing thing happened
what would be the most amusing outcome
of that well you didn't see it coming
but there's a company called Taj Quantum
that announced they just got a patent
for a higher than room temperature
superconductivity
and they're saying No this is the real
thing
we have the real one we haven't been
bragging about it but we did just get a
patent for it now the fact that they
patented
their
I guess act above room temperature type
2 superconductor do you think the fact
that they achieved a patent
means that it's real
what do you say they they got a patent
now the patent is a check to see if the
technology is legitimate I guess that's
the best way to say it is it legitimate
and Innovative and unique
here's what they don't do in the patent
office
they don't reproduce the experiment
they don't they can't tell if your data
is made up
unless you know you do something really
stupid they don't know if you made up
the data
they just know that you satisfied the
requirements of the patent
that's it so having a patent does not
tell you that you have superconductive
materials it does tell you that you
satisfied the patent requirements
so now we have two claims of
superconductivity what would you how
much money would you place
to bet that either company
or both has actually achieved this
breakthrough in a way that really does
change civilization
what do you think of the odds I think
close to zero yeah I hate to say it
close to zero
but I like to think it's true I like to
think maybe
but unfortunately just feels like zero I
hate to say it
well there's some news that Chinese
hackers New York Times reporting may
have inserted malicious computer code
into our networks so they could turn off
our power grids and communication
systems and Water Supplies
according to U.S officials or at least
the water supplies that feed American
military bases
and what do you think you think that's
true
do you think it's true that China has
inserted lines of hacker code
obviously no
I'm going to say no
it's possible it's possible
but you really don't think we can find a
code that doesn't belong there
wouldn't we know the wouldn't we know
the size of a program before it was
loaded and what was in it can't we just
are you telling me that we can't say all
right these are the these are the
applications running on this server
let us compare the exact code in all of
these programs to the exact code that we
loaded and see if anything changed you
know well after it got loaded
or maybe maybe got changed in production
so after loading doesn't tell you
anything but possible
possible
now there's two ways to look at that one
is that of course is true and we did the
same thing to them already
what do you think of that how about of
course is true because it's just routine
not only is it routine but we're doing
exactly the same thing to them in Russia
and maybe our allies too who knows
yeah that's possible so this is one of
the weird ones where it could be
complete BS or it could be just normal
and it means nothing but if it's
complete BS it's not a problem and if
it's completely normal
I don't even know if that's a problem
right because if we knew China turned
off our power
we would treat it just like they nuked
us wouldn't we
as in you've got five minutes to turn
the power back on
or it's going to get bright over there
right so to me them having access to
turn off our our grid and we all die
seems not that different than having
nuclear weapons
given that we would know about it
all right
um I just saw interesting meme go by
about the elections but I think that's
unconfirmed
all right so I don't know maybe the
Chinese actors are in maybe they're not
sounds a little fakish
uh what about that uh mysterious Chinese
covet lab uncovered in the city of
Reedley California
I don't know where readily is
but I hope I don't live near it
readily
anyway uh there was some you know code
enforcement thing that uncovered an
illegal lab doing all kinds of things
like pregnancy test kits bacterial and
viral agents and all kinds of mice and
stuff like that they don't know what's
up but it seems to be Chinese related
lab
uh do you know what's true about that
story
uh
uh maybe nothing
all right this is like the
quintessential story
of you better wait and see on this one
I don't know there's something very fake
and wrong about the whole story
that doesn't mean it there's not no
there's nothing there I mean there's
probably a lab but it kind of makes you
wonder if it really has any importance
to anything could it be that there's
some people born in China
who are just running an illegal little
business
and that's it
why not that why can't it just be some
people born in China living in the
United States
who made a lab and said hey let's see
what we can make that we could sell and
you know they're trying a bunch of stuff
maybe I know it just seems to me that if
this were some kind of you know illegal
Chinese
if it were a Chinese plot
I don't know why they would have
five different product lines
why would they have five different
product lines where things are working
on if it's a terrorist lab
you know pregnancy kits
that
so there's something about this story
that doesn't add up but it doesn't mean
it's some kind of Chinese attack
I don't know what it is but it's just
confusing at this point that's all we
know
all right here's a
here's a little advice
um
if you're a liar and you're a gigantic
liar which of these two things should
you do you know you're lying about
everything all the time you should make
generic statements that are hard to fact
check
or you should make very detailed
specific claims that would be easy to
fact check
remember you're a giant liar all the
time which one do you do
I'd say you want to go with the generic
stuff right you want to put in people's
minds an idea that the people themselves
add the details to
so you want the you want the recipient
of your language to put in the details
because if you gave them the details
they could fact check it do you want
them to imagine details
so Kamal Harris
said somewhere in public that extremists
are advancing a national agenda that is
a full-on attack against hard-won
freedoms and rights
but as she says she's going to keep
fighting and win
so who are the extremists that's kind of
General
and why do you say they have a national
agenda or are they all working together
and it's a full-on attack against
hard-won freedoms and rights and which
ones were they which are the freedoms
and rights that are under attack by
these extremists can you name some
name some that are under attack
all right I'll name some
of the things that are under attack by
the extremists are looting the right to
loot without going to jail
that's under attack right the right to
loot
without having bail and without ever
going to jail that's right because right
now that in effect that's a right that
people and cities have how about the
right to get into college even if you're
less qualified than other people of
other races
about that right
are the extremists fighting against the
right to discriminate by race in college
admissions they are they're fighting
against discrimination
how about Job preferences
by race are the extremists fighting
against using race as a hiring
Preference they are very extremists how
about child mutilations as the right
would call it others would call it
gender reaffirming surgery
are the extremists against minors making
decisions that alter their bodies for
the rest of their lives
they are they're fighting that so
they're fighting the right to loot
uh be racist in colleges and job
preferences and for parents to mutilate
children if the children claim it's
necessary for their for there's good
mental health
those are the extremist policies
the common layers is against and do you
see why she didn't mention any of the
freedoms and rights
the reason she didn't mention the
freedom and rights that are being taken
away
is because she can't
because no nobody wants a country that
does this kind of stuff or at least not
many people
now she's probably also thinking about
abortion
but she doesn't have an argument there
either because so far the only thing
that's been done that's changed is that
the Republicans have said let the states
decide
because the states are closer to the
people
that's it
so you didn't have a right taken away
except you know you could Define it that
way by Roe versus Wade decision instead
you had to write there was modified so
it was more appropriate to the
population in other words the population
could have more control over their own
rights by taking it down to the state
level
so the extremists
gave individuals a little bit more
control over their own rights by making
it a state issue state by state
and that's the extremists
how do they make extremists sound good
did you see that coming I actually am
starting to embrace extremists as a
label that's making me sound
well that I would like to be one of
those
I would like to be an extremist who is
against looting
I I wear that badge I'm totally an
extremist about that I think there
should be laws about a border
oh I'm total extremist on that I think
we should maybe have a country with a
border totally extremist
so that's my advice if you're a big old
liar keep it generic because you don't
want details
all right
um
have I missed any fun stories today
was was all of today's news about fake
news was everybody let me let me check
all right I mean there's real things
that people said
but uh yeah I don't know seems like all
the real news is about fake news
other than somebody said something once
keep it General Scott does this with his
predictions do I
do I make General predictions do you
remember my general prediction that said
Trump would win in 2016.
sort of sort of generally
you just sort of generally whipped
Against All Odds
do you remember my general prediction
that the vaccinations wouldn't work
sort of General
they won't work
oh well
but I will I will give you that my
prediction about some kind of counter
Force Rising
uh that doesn't feel like a prediction
that feels like a description of what
I'm feeling
progression is headed to the Polish
border do you think burgosian is with
Wagner
do you think he's with his army
when I told you that progression was
absolutely definitely not going to
Belarus to live his life
was that sort of General
sort sort of generic statement no that
was very specific he's not on the plane
that's pretty specific
how about when the secret Sonic weapon
was in the news and I said does not
exist you will never see evidence of a
secret Sonic weapon kind of generic
I don't know I make pretty specific
predictions
um do you believe Antarctica telescope
laser weapon whistleblower no
somebody says there's some Antarctica
laser weapon
no I don't believe that
there
there does let's see what uh
wait wait wait is that true Devin Archer
is John Kerry's stepson
is that true
somebody's just saying in the comments I
don't know if I believe anything
the specific ocean
all right
uh was there anything else I've
forgotten
somebody says it's true I think see this
this is why you need the app of who's
connected to who
when wouldn't the whole story about
um
the story about Hunter makes a lot more
sense
if this is true somebody's saying that
uh the Hunter's business partner
was John Kerry's stepson
doesn't the story feel different with
that information
feels a little different doesn't it
so that's what we need we need the app
that shows everybody's connection to
everybody else so the news makes sense
you could even imagine the news being
overlaid onto the map of connections
right so imagine the map
and then the news story is overlaid on
the person
so if you want to read that news you can
click on the person but as soon as you
click on it it lights up all their
connections to the other the other
well-known characters
that would be news
now that would be news you could use the
rest of the news is you can't really use
it because you don't know what's real
like Amazon's x-ray maybe I don't know
what Amazon's x-ray is
created the partnership on his advice I
don't know about that
guilt by association no
how did you even hear guilt by
association
no
Association simply explains the
situation
it's not like you had lunch with
somebody that's that's not what I'm
talking about but if you're actually
related to somebody or you're married to
somebody
yeah I want to know that
I want to know that
all right yeah
good screen thank you Rick appreciate it
um
is there a coven 2.0 I don't know
I I've never believed in the intentional
release of covid
so the the world economic order can be
preserved or so I don't believe that
speaking of Greg goffelt did you see he
got heat for the the crazy people
calling him anti-semitic for saying
nothing like that
so without even getting the details what
of what he did or did not say just trust
me can you trust me he didn't say
anything there was even remotely you
could even you could even construe it as
possibly being anti-semitic and he isn't
right and he isn't so
but there was some some horrible person
wrote an article he decided to come down
hard on her on Twitter it came down
pretty hard on his his uh his Troll and
she was complaining about it
right it was complaining so she was
complaining that there was pushback to
her story
so she's trying to ruin somebody's
career just to get clicks on a story
that's clearly and obviously untrue and
anybody could tell it's untrue she could
tell it herself so
that's like the worst person in the
world
imagine trying to ruin somebody's
reputation in life
for a few clicks
for a few clicks you're the worst person
in the whole world if you do
that
whole world you're just a terrible scum
and I think Greg was just calling around
because I think the people who are
seriously just the scum of the earth the
ones who are just making up stories to
take people down I think they
they need to be called out
and maybe that's part of the part of the
force that's happening I think you're
seeing more and more people who
reflexively know that when you see a
claim about a famous person being bad
unless they win full Mel Gibson and it's
on video it's not true
it's not true
all right I'll explore the book with
x-ray got it
um
so Teddy we have a stupid person here
I'd like to talk to
so Teddy
um
and you know you're too stupid to talk
to honestly because I know you don't
believe what you're saying so there's
somebody on YouTube who's trying to sell
the idea that uh
I'm not even going to repeat what you
said you're too stupid to be
talking in public right if you actually
believe if you actually believe there's
somebody who thinks there was an upside
to the Holocaust or to slavery
because you think you heard it on TV
you're a idiot
nobody nobody anywhere ever had those
thoughts and you know it you know it
Teddy Teddy you know it come on you know
it admit it you know you're lying
and you know that nobody has ever had
the thoughts you're imagining that Greg
Gutfeld had or you're imagining somebody
else had
right didn't happen nobody ever had
those thoughts nobody ever said those
thoughts
and you know it you know it never
happened Teddy
all right that's all I got for you
YouTubers I'll talk to you tomorrow
thanks for being awesome
except for Teddy
