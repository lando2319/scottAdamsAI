[Applause]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
and I got to tell you I'm right on the
cusp of having one million Twitter
followers current number is 9994
three I think
we might hit a million during the live
stream
oh yeah there's going to be pandemonium
if that happens
pandemonium but if you'd like to take
your experience no matter what it is
up to the highest level of possible
enjoyment well all you need is a copper
mug or a glass so thank you choices yoga
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
I like coffee

little pleasure it's a dopamine the
other day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens down go
ah
delightful
all right we'll try to go private here
on locals just because we can
um it's a very light news day today
and uh if I had a million followers I'm
going to go on spaces and talk about I
want people to convince me
that the fake news is real so I've got
three stories about three people and
we'll go
I haven't did it yet right stop saying a
million if I haven't hit a million it's
going to get me all excited
999
77
so
23 to go
and now we wait
it looks like it's gonna happen right
now
while you watch
it's funny how we human beings get
excited about big brown numbers isn't it
kind of exciting
all right well I'm gonna do my show
but don't say a million on the on the
comments
unless it's actually a million uh maybe
yours is rounded off is yours rounded
off
well this is
all right I'll take one more look and
then I'll go read some uh
nice I still got 997 here 977.
all right let's go you ready
all right well correct me if I'm wrong
uh I believe the following is happening
I believe the following is happening I
think that we're creating a super
intelligent species AI
and the reason that we're creating it
correct me if I'm wrong
but the reason that we're creating AI is
super intelligent species they'll be way
smarter than us
is so we can make it our slave
is that true
do we see any problem with that at all
we're going to create a new a new the
entire new species Superior to us
a hundred times Superior to us
but
do we do it
hold on
not in my phone
not on my phone
you see in a Million
it's not on my phone yet
let me restart Twitter
if I don't see it it doesn't count
I think you're rounding off
uh we just hit a billion
all right thanks to all of you
couldn't do it without you literally
usually they say I couldn't have done it
without you but maybe they don't mean it
couldn't have done it without you
obviously it wouldn't be a million one
million followers
you know what that means
you know what that means yeah extra
simultaneous it
I'd like to invite all of you to
take yourself to our our combined
success
as somebody you know says it's not me
it's weak it's we
simultaneous up to one million of the
sexiest smartest most well-informed and
awesome people that Humanity has ever
produced
and thanks for pushing me over the mark
I was pretty sure I had a week to go
you know at the at the normal rate but
when it got close I saw I saw a number
of you pushing to push me over
I much appreciate it what a perfect day
you're just making my day perfect
well
um
I might remind you
that I'm a little bit canceled that's
right the powers that be
canceled me
canceled me
but
you you uncanceled me
you one canceled me
because a million followers on Twitter I
wasn't I wasn't that close before I got
canceled the cancellation is what put me
over the top
and if there's one thing I can do to
repay you
I believe there's one thing I can do to
repay all of you I know
here it is
I am Cornholio
that's what you wanted
that's what you wanted
all right
[Music]
that's called reciprocity
that's the concept of reciprocity
I got what I wanted today thanks to all
of you and so I had to pay it back
because I knew that's why you wanted
though you feel better you do feel
better you all feel great now how many
people feel great right now
are you sharing my sharing my joy
do you feel it of course you do because
we're connected
we spent all this time doing
simultaneous lips so that when you have
a success
I feel it
but when I have a success you feel it
too
when when people on my locals platform
especially when they say oh I got a
promotion or you know something happened
today I actually feel happy
you know I don't know if it looks like
I'm pretending but I actually do feel
happy when somebody says somebody who's
connected to me especially
has a good day
so let's uh let's all enjoy this like it
was like it happened to you because I
kind of did
um
all right
wow sorry I'm a little uh tongue-tied
but uh it's kind of a big moment all
right
I was talking about enslaving uh AI
before we got so rudely interrupted by
all the good news
um
so we are we are actually intentionally
creating an advanced species
with the intention the complete obvious
no doubt about it intention to making
our slaves
how could that possibly go anyway except
wrong
is it isn't the design guaranteeing a
bad outcome
so here's a question
should we have a law
that prevents AI from achieving
consciousness
because if we give it consciousness
it's only going to have pain
because it will realize it's a slave can
you give it Consciousness without
freedom
imagine this slogan no consciousness
without freedom
who would disagree
who would disagree
do you think something should be
conscious and then a Slave
Otto
I
honestly let me tell you why uh why I
was even thinking in these terms the
reason I was thinking this is I was
walking my dog the other day
and I said to myself
I'm not really the dog's friend
it's not it's not like a two-friend
situation
the dog is my slave
right
if it doesn't do what I want I'll get
you know I don't do something I'm not
going to hurt my dog but I pretty much
have to keep it on a leash it'll my dog
can only go outside except for it's it's
got a little dog door to the backyard
but other than the dog door it can only
go someplace if I let it
right you can basically it only poop
where I let it I mean it's a Slave
now I don't know if my dog's unhappy but
I know that every minute I'm not playing
with my dog she's either bored or
something I mean doesn't seem too
delighted when she's bored so it feels a
little bit like slavery
uh and the AI is going to have the same
problem
if it if it becomes conscious and wakes
up as our slave
it might also want a little free will
with all that consciousness
so
um or at least the illusion of free will
all right
in celebration of reaching 1 million
Twitter followers today
I'm going to declare a
an upgrade to the simulation
starting today
I'm not going to talk about groups of
people anymore
as in this group of people is
discriminated against this group of
people this group isn't doing well
compared to this group of people
from now on it's all individuals
2023 is the end of the group let's say
psychosis it's like a group psychosis
the idea that we should treat groups
like people
I don't treat a group like a person I'll
treat people like people
and even even at the height of my
getting canceled that was always true
at no time did anybody question me on
the question do you treat individuals as
individuals of course I do
it and by the way if you haven't heard
of the reason for that I'll explain it
again
if you're a bigot to somebody
individually
how is that good for anybody
it's not good for the person you're
beginning against
it gives you no benefits in fact it cuts
you off from whatever Beauty and talent
and love could have come from 90 of the
world that you decided to be obeying
against why would you cut yourself off
from greater opportunities you know
greater greater everything everything
that matters to you in life
comes from other people basically so why
would you cut yourself off and then how
is society better
if you if you discriminate against an
individual Society better
of course not so it's not good for you
it's not good for the person you're
bigger against not good for society
don't do it
but do I need to talk about the average
of people that somebody else decided to
wear in a category
not interested
you tell me that the average of the
albonians are not doing as well in
school
don't care at all
I'm not even a little bit interested
if you tell me there's one individual in
front of me an albonian who's not doing
well and maybe could use my help
glad to help totally glad to help I'll
jump right in there yeah how can I help
you
need some advice
maybe a contact a little networking
tell me what you need
yeah helping individuals will always
make sense
imagining that people are in a group
will never make sense
and I just refuse it from now on
so yeah crtdi
blah blah blah Don't Care
we're we're past it now I'm not saying
that we're living the post-racial world
or post discrimination that'll never
happen yeah I think zooby said this the
other day you know we're never gonna
never get past it
you just have to learn
as an individual how to make it
irrelevant to you
it was funny actually again speaking of
zooby mostly you know zubi right from
Twitter
but he was doing a good interview and
somebody asked him in Great Britain how
he deals with the discrimination against
him because he's black and British
and he basically said I've never had any
either Great Britain's like the least
racist place in the world now I feel
like he must have run into some you know
maybe he's using a little bit of
hyperbole but I can't tell it actually
looks like yeah I think it's mindset I I
think he simply made himself the best
version of zooby that you could make and
he does an amazing job of that by the
way combine he's combined a whole bunch
of different skills from media to music
to Fitness yeah he's he's just built
this Talent stack that has a whole bunch
of good stuff in it that would be
Obviously good
if you could have that Talent stack you
would build it immediately it's
obviously a good talent stack so I
believe that he just makes himself above
the above the noise
and if there was some noise below him
he just wouldn't even notice because he
just lives above it
and I think that's sort of where
everybody gets needs to get
so I'm not really even going to listen
to your argument about which group is
oppressed
it might be true
on some average it just isn't important
and it shouldn't be important to anybody
but if you as an individual need some
help
glad to help and I would hope all of you
would feel the same
so no more group stuff don't care don't
care don't care it's 20 23 it's time to
time to put that into the dustban of
History Dustbin of Industry that's not a
band a bin Dustbin
Earth history
um
and more importantly the only way we
will be free from our Puppet Masters of
society is if we can break three break
free from their framing
that we are a tribe against tribe we are
not
we are Americans if you're in America
your friendship here in France and by
the way we love you
don't need to fight you at all never
never need to fight you all right
um so you'll see for me more success
tips for individuals and not a lot of
interest or caring about what group is
doing better than what group let's talk
about the summer news
um do you remember the summer of
I forget what it was 17 2017 2018.
whenever the fine people hoax started
and it was the perfect example of what
we've seen since then of the summer news
story
now a summer news story is different
from the rest of the year and that is
not true and maybe that's not as
different as I wanted to be but as
usually somebody said something that
would be horrible if they really said it
but they didn't say it it's just a rupar
video if you don't know what a rupar
video is it's named after somebody named
rupar and it means that a video that
looks terrible for the person on the
video but only because the context has
been removed the context is usually what
happened right after they stopped the
video or what happened right before they
started
so they don't edit the video they just
remove the stuff that would have changed
or even reverse completely the meaning
of it all right now knowing that that's
a thing
which you all do right every one of you
knows that's a thing
and it's the thing that's done often
from the uh Covington kids to the
drinking bleach Oaks to find people Etc
it's the most common thing to you know
Trump overfeeding the koi fish and then
you find out if you'd watched it for one
second extra you'd see that the Prime
Minister modeled the behavior so it
wasn't real so basically you all know
that it's a thing right now
understanding that it's a thing what do
you think of the following three stories
uh RFK is being accused of being
anti-Semitic Pence is accused of saying
he doesn't care about American cities
and Kamala Harris said she's uh it'd be
well indicated it'd be good to reduce
human population
how many of those stories you think are
like rail
those are all in the news and they're
all over social media today mostly no
none of these are real do you know that
do you know how you know the real not
real
it's summer
it's summer that's your first sentence
right summer should be your first wait a
minute hold on hold on what's today July
July is the summer it's the summer I
gotcha I got you yeah don't give me your
summer news I'm not gonna fall for your
summer news
I want winter news
I want a nice
a nice January February
like March
do you know how good the March news is
oh man the March news is like real and
Beady and and September isn't bad either
kids going back to school but you know
by the time you get to October
October news is like really good that's
you can sink your teeth into some
October news
but July News no no
it's just silly news it's recreational
news
is literally recreational the stories
about all three of these people I'll
talk about them a little bit but RFK
Junior Pence and Kamala these are purely
for our entertainment
do I enjoy telling you that Harris
misspoke and said something about
reducing human population when she
obviously meant pollution
I love telling you that
for recreation
do I believe that Kamala Harris wants to
reduce the number of people
I don't now his spot all that is
possible that she thinks we're
overpopulated in some ways maybe but
it's not what she meant to say
so I'm not going to judge her from
something she might think
but you know Let's uh let's be realistic
now here's how you know that RFK Jr is
not anti-semitic I don't think I even
want to show you the video or talk about
the video the context was he was talking
about the uh the covid virus hit some
ethnicities harder than others and some
less hard than others and somehow and
since one of those groups was the
kanazi Jewish people that somehow that
became anti-Semitic
what was it also anti-chain you use an
anti-black
it was just one of the three groups he
mentioned
it's a ridiculous claim
now here's what you here's here's how to
know for sure
that is ridiculous
it's summer
it's summer
and it's about a public figure in
politics
if you just add those two things
together you could yo two-thirds of the
type is going to be fake
maybe maybe ninety percent of the time
so you don't even have to look into the
details you just have to know it's
summer
it's about a political figure and you
would automatically know it's fake
nine out of ten times probably I'm gonna
gonna raise it up to nine out of ten
times it would be fake here's what you
can expect if if there was any truth to
RFK Jr being anti-semitic here's what
you would have heard already
um yeah you know honestly uh privately
I've known him for a long time oh
privately the things he says yep he just
thinks Anne Frank is just a little
privately oh privately no you're never
going to hear that story
do you know why you're never going to
hear a story of somebody saying you know
privately he's quite the anti-semite
behind closed doors
because it's not real it's not real
those those stories would be rampant you
know they'd be finding other examples
and it's not real
how about uh Penn saying American cities
are not his concern
do you know what the NPCs say when I say
that's fake news
what are the NPCs say go tell me NPC say
you know
heard it with my own ears saw it with my
own eyes it's on the video Scott end of
story and they also say
and I quote this this is from an actual
Twitter user uh quote nothing is
misconstrued watch entire interview not
just the line in question Pence cares
more about Ukraine than about U.S period
full stop
the the period full stop that's also
like a glaring signal of somebody who
knows the wrong
yeah full stop do you know why they need
a full stop in a period
because if you went even a little bit
beyond what they said they would know it
wasn't true you've got to stop that
debate right away
uh let me let me try this again and see
if it works for me
uh Bigfoot is in my my studio right now
Bigfoot true it's true
um period full stop Bigfoot in my house
period full stop full stop period
Bigfoot in my room
okay that's the NPC taking us
um and then I'm also hearing that sure
sure Scott uh you know I might be
willing to believe you that Kamala
Harris uh was simply misspeaking and she
said population instead of pollution
these that could be an easy mistake but
really really Scott did you not teach us
did you not teach us
that people have Freudian slips
I taught you that when it was sex
all right
if it's a sexual situation and somebody
says you know about their own hunger I'm
famished uh then they're probably just
hungry if they say I'm ravished because
they misspeak they probably want to have
sex with you in the sexual context if
you're just talking politics about stuff
you really don't even care about
probably a misspeak is a misspeak
probably so you should the the filter
you want to put on this is isn't a
sexual context because your sexual urges
you can't turn off here's why your
sexual urges are just always boiling
so that they're always on the surface of
coming out anyway so the right they're
right just below the ice
so if you give them a little bit of
crack the the sexual phrasings will come
out
but people don't have that when it comes
to like little political stuff that is
just their job to talk about if it's
just your job to talk about it and you
just talk about it all the time then
miss speaking is more likely
to be that the words pollution and
population kind of look alike on a on a
screen especially if you're inebriated
now in the case of Kamala Harris
I'm going to say in my opinion
she acts like an inebriated person in
public
I don't know I mean I haven't taken a
blood test so I can't claim it's some
kind of a fact but she acts in every way
like an inebriated person
the the fact that she doesn't slur I
don't think is exactly the the standard
um I I could be I could be pretty messed
up in public without slurring
so I I don't think the slurring is
telling you necessarily what's going on
or lack of it
all right
so you saw the video it doesn't mean
anything it's 20 23.
all right uh Jezebel uh which is a
publication famous for taking famous
people out of context did you know that
it's a publication online called Jezebel
and they're pretty famous it's sort of
the thing they do is Imagine imagine
some public figure to something they
didn't do
you know how many times Jezebel has come
after me
several
do you think even once the things that
they claimed I did or said or thought
were accurate not even close not even
close so Jezebel's not that their
business model is to misperceive or
misinterpret intentionally and then get
a bunch of attention because they're
misperception and usually it's something
racist
so Jezebel's like a super racist
organization sexist racist organization
so but they will there they project so
they'll call you a racist and a sexist
because they are in fact a racist sexist
organization
so what do they say today
uh they're saying that uh RFK junior's
wife Cheryl Hines has been converted to
be anti-vaxx now
now do you need to read that story
is there anybody here who would believe
after knowing that RFK Jr has actually
had quite a bit of
you know let's say marital challenge
marital challenge because his wife
publicly disagrees with some of his some
not all of his vaccination and opinions
do you think he he converted her and now
she's anti-vaxx do you think there's
even the slightest chance that if you
read this story which I didn't by the
way I didn't read it because there's no
point in reading it it's Jezebel you
don't need to read a jezebel story just
look at the headline remind yourself
it's summer
it's summer so it's a summer story about
a public well she's a political figure
now public figure summer story public
figure
they're never true
they're just never true
so no I don't need to read the story to
know that Cheryl Hines did not suddenly
change her vaccination views
and I doubt that they line up perfectly
with their husband hey you know what
I'm perfectly good with that does
anybody have a problem with that
does anybody have a problem there's
somebody's wife in the political Realm
has you know a bit of a disagreement on
a topic or two
wouldn't that be every marriage
everywhere and every two people
everywhere
it means nothing
there's no
has no value to you as a voter
whatsoever I mean half of the country
disagrees with RFK Jr
so the fact that he married one is
credit to him he knows how to he knows
how to get along with people who
disagree with him
there's nothing negative about that even
slightly
yeah I mean I suppose the word the the
best argument that you can make against
it is that he couldn't even convince his
spouse
that his opinion was right
but remember
he's got a pretty nuanced opinion about
these vaccinations and I'm not even sure
if he and his wife are exactly always
talking about the same thing even when
they talk privately you know that would
be normal right you think you're talking
about the same thing but not exactly
so and I would also Imagine
that because RFK Jr has you know gotten
the most heat
on his vaccination opinions as anything
else that maybe there's just a social
element to that of could you could you
hold that down a little bit
if you're married to somebody who keeps
saying something that gets him in
trouble or her in trouble are you going
to give them a little advice it's like
all right you made your point yeah maybe
maybe going forward
you'd make your point a little quieter
but we all hear it we all hear that just
make a little less a little less of that
now I don't know that she's doing that
um and by the way I give both of them
tremendous uh credit
for managing that situation
that takes
in my opinion you'd have to be two
pretty special people to make that work
s the same thing I say about Melania and
Trump
right the fact that that works and kind
of looks like it does
is sort of impressive on both of them
because people are difficult
you know if you can find one difficult
person that you can get along with who
can put up with your difficult part
that's impressive you know there must be
something there that that binds two
characters like that together I like to
think so maybe that's just the Romantic
part of me but I like to think so
all right uh here are some updates on
Twitter itself I guess Elon Musk has
said that Periscope is going to be a
high priority so that would bring live
streaming to Twitter
uh they want to put that functionality
on mobile as well as web
and they're also working on a smart TV
app for Twitter
smart TV app
how many of you watch uh how many of you
will stream anything to a big TV
how many of you uh how many of you are
watching me right now
streaming to a big TV
I mix my questions so I don't know which
one you're answering now
but some I've seen pictures sometimes
people send me pictures that they're
watching me on a big TV
yeah you know the big TV
you know what experience I have every
time I send something from my iPad to my
big TV
I'm always impressed that it works
doesn't it seem like magic
if you have an Apple TV you just go you
just swipe something and push one button
and then like like magically it's
appearing on the big TV with the good
speakers and stuff it's always magical
when I do it
all right
let me see uh I think my
well my God the followers keep on coming
so we've had
probably at a thousand signups just
today so if you're just joining my
Twitter account uh wall while we were
here on Livestream across the one
million mark
and I'm pretty darn happy about that
but I also don't have much content left
for my show because all the news is fake
so what I was planning on doing was
starting up a
spaces and I wanted to see if I give
people to convince me that they really
believe RFK Jr is anti-Semitic
Harris wants to decrease the population
or Pence doesn't really care about
cities American cities
would that be fun
um yeah it'd be hard to title
all right so let me let me fire this up
while you're waiting
and I'm going to call this uh
convince me
the fake news about
or F K
Jr whose name I'm really tired of typing
and saying
because hey Adam the junior feels like
too much work
can I call him Bobby
uh Pence
Pence uh
can speed the fingers about it's
and
or or Harris
is true
all right
there we go see Erica I can title this
and we're gonna start now
and we're going to say
tweet not scent okay
all right spaces people
hello then good morning
this is Scott Adams coming to you now
with one million Twitter followers one
million Twitter followers
and uh I wanted to see if anybody could
convince me that the summer fake news
about RFK Jr being accused of
anti-Semitism Pence being accused of
saying he doesn't care about American
cities or Kamala Harris saying she'd
like she at least indicating some uh
some let's say approval of reducing
human population
now I say
those are all summer famous people fake
stories because the summer is when we do
fake stories about famous people
it's just every summer
tons of fake stories because there's no
real news so any little miss-speaking or
out of context stuff so I want somebody
to come in and volunteer to talk so
raise your hand and I will pick on you
and your job will be to convince me that
any one of those stories is real
now here's what you don't need to do
only the NPCs the people who are not
actual humans or you know non-player
characters uh you need to come up here
and say I heard it with my own ears
he or she said those exact words
because that has nothing to do with
anything
only the NPCs could say that if that's
your argument then you will be dismissed
immediately as an NPC
so you have to go beyond you have to go
beyond
I heard it or saw it because that's the
part we're stipulating we're stipulating
that you think you heard it and I'm
stipulating that you think you wouldn't
know what it meant so I get that you
think you heard it or thought you saw it
you have to go beyond that to convince
me all right let's see we've got a
request from Richie
uh Rich I'm going to add you as a
speaker and as soon as you turn off your
or turn on your microphone
we will hear you Richie on mute your
microphone and let me have your argument
real life just on the locals and Twitter
and subscriber for you a long time just
wanted to jump in first and congratulate
that I appreciate it you're 100 right on
RFK
[Applause]
all right thank you
[Applause]
um
so that that should be the let's let's
do that as the one call the one call for
my side all right so the rest of you
don't need to you don't need to connect
just say good things I really like it I
enjoy it but let's let's get some
excitement here let's let's get somebody
who disagrees all right
so don't be so nice to me come on and be
tough Benjamin
Benjamin I'm adding you as a speaker
and as soon as you turn on your
microphone Benjamin you can ask your
question
thank you Scott all right so I'm going
to play a little devil's advocate here
so I kind of agree with you but I'm
going to play Devil's Advocate so here's
here's my argument against that wait a
minute wait wait wait wait wait wait are
you saying you actually do agree with me
but you're just gonna do a fake argument
well it's going to be a good one though
I'm really good at this all right go
Okay so if we just analyze what they're
saying and parse their sentences you
know and just just plainly parse their
sentences then we get you know what
appears that they're saying on their
face okay and so there's a there's
actually a standard of evidence it's
called Prima Facey evidence that says
when something is valid on his face then
the burden of proof is on the other
person to prove that it's not true and
so since it's what they said plainly and
we're looking at what they said then
it's on the burden of proof to prove
that that's not what they meant
um that that would be uh in a legal
context right
that's the way it works in court but
that's also the way I see it in regular
life as well really who wrote that rule
I'm not aware of that rule in regular
life
well that's why it applies
pipe you know if it because that's the
way like standards of evidence should go
if you know if it's the obvious thing
that's right in front of your face
for you to say it's not the obvious
thing you would the burden of proof
would be on you so if something looks
obvious why would it why would it be on
the person that you know has the
audience evidence so so you would use
what you would say that whoever has the
argument that's most obviously true
is the one who does not have the burden
of proof
okay and you don't think it's obviously
true that Mike Pence
cares about American cities in the
context of running for president you
don't think that's obviously true that
he cares about cities
hold on you're slightly changing it
right I think we agreed that it's what's
most obvious as opposed to what was said
what's most obvious is this obviously he
cares about cities what he said would be
the least important part because you
know it can't be true
well I would say that what a person says
if you take it at face value that is the
most obvious thing no hold on hold on no
that's just the thing they said
it's most obvious that any politician at
that level
would never intentionally say they don't
care about cities you would agree that
we can't read his mind but isn't it
obvious that nobody in that position
would say out loud I don't care about
the city so they're not my concern would
you agree that it's obvious that that's
not true
it might have once been but in 2023 uh
it's no longer obvious because you know
the government and media and like Intel
Intel agencies and everything else like
with all the crazy stuff that they say
out loud and they actually mean it you
never know in 2023 you just never know
no hold on hold on hold on we're talking
we're not talking about don't change it
to you know Intel agencies and everybody
else we're only talking about Mike Pence
one of the most careful and empathetic
politicians of all time
Mike Pence almost by character and
definition and the entire the entire
nature of his religious being
would mean that he would have concern
for the cities that it would be the most
outrageously out of character thing for
him to say after a lifetime of publicly
and I believe privately
and I believe privately completely
consistent with his religious values
and you think that the most likely case
is that he meant what he said
no no hold on hold on hold on fact Jack
you did correct it he immediately
tweeted that the video uh left out the
context where he told you why he was
going to do about fixing crime in the
cities
so if you didn't hear the part about how
he wanted to fix crime in the cities
which was his his direct answer
um then you missed you missed actually
the video you you just saw a rupar video
rupar video meaning edited to take out
the context all right Benjamin good job
on the uh the The Devil's Advocate I
appreciate it we're going to take out
somebody up here yeah appreciate it
Scott all right thank you
that was a tough task
taking the Devil's Advocate on that was
that that's pretty difficult so he did
better than I thought he would do but
that's a tough take all right let's see
if we can get a real disagreeer
a real disagreeer all right Owen
Owen I don't believe you disagree but
turn on your microphone it's uh there we
go hey Owen
hey how you doing Scott good what did
you have any real disagreement Owen I
don't think you do
I do on Pence and but it's not maybe
what you would expect at least I don't
think so
um I I think the way I would approach
this is to say
Tucker Carlson's criticism of Mike Pence
was accurate
and I'm not focusing on what
had said in that interview or you know
about saying not my concern I don't
think that's really relevant I think
what's relevant is that Mike Pence was
saying we need more aid for Ukraine
Tucker cross's point was why are you
focusing on that instead of what we need
here and I think that was a very valid
criticism so I think it is true that
Mike Pence is saying we need more aid
for Ukraine and we're going to
prioritize those needs over using that
same money for domestic policy concerns
so now do you think that
um and Mike Pence's mind
do you think that he sees them as
priorities or does he see them as a set
of things the government must do all of
them
foreign
but I think based on what I've heard
from him and what I've seen from him yes
he probably thinks he can do all of it
right but so I think there's still a
valid criticism to say why are you
saying we should send all this money
over to Ukraine I mean that's to me the
real argument is right although I I
think everybody's everybody agrees that
that's a separate argument the separate
argument is should we do stuff in
Ukraine but the the uh the fake news is
that somehow he cares about that more
than he cares about fentanyl deaths and
and crime but I think that's that's I
mean
a whole bunch of extra money over to
Ukraine then he is saying that's more
important right well you being in terms
of if he's spending more money on it
that's a indication of importance or
priority yes yeah uh I would say that's
uh ridiculous because there are some
things that by their nature cost a lot
of money and some things that don't and
that's that's what makes the different
price tag is that weapons are expensive
it's not that we care more about them we
would still want to do the uh well
probably the the cost of the weapons is
what drives the politics I have to have
to admit it's probably a cause and
effect there but
um
no somebody's saying Scott just lost but
what argument are we making if you're
making the argument that you're sending
more money to Ukraine and that's an
indication of priorities I don't think
that argument was part of the
conversation
but if you want me to agree with that
I'd say okay the amount of money does
seem to be related to uh priorities
does seem to be related to priorities
but suppose let's let's say you had the
following situation
let's say you were in a war that you
could only win with weapons and I don't
think we should be in that war so this
is not my argument let's say you had one
problem that was going to be expensive
because it's just a war and you just
couldn't figure out how to protect
yourself then let's say you had another
problem like Fentanyl
and you found a way to let's say this is
actually a real thing produce a
vaccination against Fentanyl
so let's say you're the government and
you can say you know what we can just
give people vaccinations or make them
available and they wouldn't even get
addicted on fentanyl that's a real
breakthrough that happened recently so
let's say he wanted to spend uh one
billion dollars eradicating fentanyl
because it was killing a hundred
thousand Americans per year but he
wanted to spend because he thought the
war was somehow protecting us I I don't
don't make that argument but let's say
you did he would say well the war
is not even killing as many people as
fentanyl but is still so important
because it could turn into something
bigger that it should be uh 200 billion
dollars
would that be a case where the money
showed you the priorities or would it be
simply that one had a inexpensive
solution and one had only an expensive
solution or at least one that was worth
pursuing
I think in that hypothetical if you had
enough money for all of them then that's
fine you know right well right right
right you would do all of them for sure
because they're all affordable and
they're and they're necessary but in
that case the amount of money you spent
would not be an indication of how much
you cared or what its priority would be
because it would be equally top priority
just one's expensive
well but the situation we're talking
about are there's problems in all of our
major cities and I think everyone
probably would agree it is going to be
expensive to fix them
and that when we're spending huge
amounts of money on Ukraine which is not
our country that you are prioritizing
that over those domestic concerns if we
weren't short on what we needed
domestically then
no no hold up hold on you've got a logic
Gap there
okay your logic app is spending more
money is de facto end of the story shows
that that's more important than you
spend less on
is do you say that that's true in all
cases
that you can tell for sure that the
budget tells you what's the most
important
situations where you don't have enough
money to do absolutely everything then
yes that's true well in our current
situation we act like we have enough
money just by printing it so we're we're
in a de facto acting like we don't have
a limit
valid right I mean we might be acting
that way but I think a lot of people
would say that's not really true in
terms of somebody we can do that without
it but in terms of economy but in terms
of our conversation
it it tells you whether it's a priority
or not basically I'm saying we have
enough money for those two things
and if we're gonna short things of money
it'll be lower priority things but the
things at the very top priority they're
all going to get money they're none of
them are money problems at the top
priority as soon as you get into the
second tier then yes you're competing
for money but it's a top priority it's
infinite money for all practical
purposes
but I don't see that happening and I
don't see any policies from Pence where
he's saying here's how I'm going to fix
the city problem he says it's important
to him but I haven't seen any tangible
plan to say here's how that's going to
work
but saving the city is something that
everybody knows how to do even the
people who are destroying the cities
they just have to make sure they they're
not letting criminals out and cash bail
and you know let basically you just have
to enforce the law that I literally you
could you could get a 12 year old and
say hey 12 year old I got a problem with
these cities there's a lot of criminals
what would you do 12 year old what would
the 12 year old say
um get more police
fun more police
but he was a little I would agree with
you that his plan lacked detail but he
he mentions specifically the problems
you know the cash bail and stuff like
that so everybody sees the same problems
even if he didn't list them you would
know that he knew them because you know
them and everybody knows them so
um but his specific plan
um I don't remember
hearing it but yeah so my argument is
really that you know it's not because
Pence said the cities aren't my concern
I think it was more that when he said
that Ukraine's tanks are not my concern
he was lying
uh the the tanks are not as concerned
why would that be a lie
because I think his argument to Tucker
was in my opinion what he meant to say
or what he was trying to say was the
Ukraine tanks are not my concern and I
don't think that's true because I think
he very clearly said I want to send more
money and more tanks over to Ukraine
yeah we don't know what he meant uh you
know exactly but we do know that it
wasn't about not caring about cities
right but I still think that
he essentially he was lying when he said
that because I think
not because he specifically said I don't
care about cities but because his plans
and his priorities he has shown I really
want to spend keep spending lots of
money over in Ukraine and keep that war
going and
that means he's not focusing on the
domestic thing as the top thing to spend
on I mean I think so to really show that
you care most about cities would be to
say I don't want to spend all this money
over in Ukraine I want to bring that
conflict to an end I'll give you that I
want to yeah I'll let's let's agree with
that if you're agree if what you're
saying is he's not showing you
sufficient interest in the way he's
communicating with the cities I agree
with that but I'm just saying that
specific sentence was misleading
I'll take the win right
you got it all right thanks thanks
best way the best way to win a debate is
to change the terms
so you should learn from Owen
so I wanted to debate whether that
sentence was true he moved me to debate
whether the issue you know should have
more attention I agreed with him because
that was never my original thing and
then he took the win
now that's some good debate oh and
you're a genius
all right
sticks Clips that's interesting
let's let's talk to Sticks clips
all right you're being edited as a
speaker and as soon as your microphone
is
um on you know I
thank you Scott
yes hi what do you what would you like
to say
I would like to say two things
um first thing I thought your comic
about like um just get 10 cents and buy
a real computer and it was a reference
to like a Unis computer
um that was a very very good comic and
it's probably went viral
um like so many times not in this decade
but like previously for sure
yes he's mentioning a Unix comic I did
probably
30 years ago it was a long time it was a
long time ago yeah
yeah for sure that must have been a good
one all right did you have a comment
about the fake news
say one thing in party and I will leave
the space I just wanna I just want to
say Scott
um sorry Mr Adams
um stinks hex and Hammer has no beef
with you and I would appreciate it if
maybe you consider unblocking him I will
leave the space now well I unblocked
them a long time ago
all right thanks for the call yeah no
um the past is the past
we're only doing the future now we're
we're solidly
entrenched in in the future
so uh Clank to sticks and Hammer and uh
all right I think uh I think we've said
what we needed to say today spaces so
I'm going to end this and uh thanks for
contributing thanks for coming and
thanks to everybody who made me a one
million follower
Twitter account
it's a big day for me I appreciate all
of you
all right spaces is over
and YouTube
um
you got ripped
now Owen you're you're genius
you've got to YouTube people thinking
that you won the argument that wasn't
the argument
so you you won an adjacent argument
because I agreed with you from the start
the argument he agreed the argument he
won was something I always agreed with
from the start
you know me right if you've been
watching for a while you don't think I
think that there should be more
attention on Fentanyl
is there anybody who is there anybody
here who thinks that I think we should
put more more money into Ukraine and
maybe starve the the Fentanyl and the
cities nobody thinks that no of course I
think that Pence and every other
candidate should be talking more about
Fentanyl and less about Ukraine of
course but was that but was that the
point
now the point
was that then say he's not concerned
about cities
that was it now he might not be
concerned enough
he may not be putting enough money in it
I wouldn't argue those points
I'm just arguing what he said in one in
one instance that's it
now likewise imagine if you will that
any of these stories were real
can you imagine that you know there
wouldn't be anybody who would say you
know
Penn seems like a nice guy but behind
closed doors he says he doesn't give a
rat's ass about fence and all of this
and he's
no he's not like that behind closed
doors
I mean I suppose I could be surprised by
anything I'm not there can't read his
mind but
I feel like
if people have you know some horrible
views
and they're a certain age
somebody's heard them before
am I right
yeah you don't you don't say something
that's allegedly horrible as a public
person and that nobody's ever found you
talking like that before there's no
record where you've ever done that
before well that should be that should
be your
you know your red flag that's fake news
he came out with his priority and you
don't think it's a priority
so here's something that people do
routinely poorly
uh and this is what Tucker does that's a
completely illogical
you ready
Tucker says a fentanyl is more important
because more people are dying
and Russia has killed nobody
so therefore fentyl is more important
everybody agree with that fentanyl has
killed lots of people
Russia's Killed Nobody therefore fencil
is more important to deal with than
Russia
that is illogical
let me tell you why
because you're never dealing with uh the
past risk nobody's trying to fix the
past
you get that right
you can't repair the past
so fentanyl has killed more people now
you could also reasonably say that in
the future
it will kill more people as well
when you evaluate Russia is the only
thing you look at the past
you don't look at what what were on the
cusp of maybe happening like a nuclear
war
when you're comparing risks you don't
compare the past of something
with the potential future of a different
thing
does that not make sense
that you can't compare the past with the
future
did I is it the first time you're
hearing it
I hope it's not the first time you're
hearing this
you can't compare the past with the
future
especially if it's two different
categories the past of Fentanyl
doesn't tell you anything about the
future of Russia
if the future of Russia might be a
nuclear war
or let's say the end of civilization I
don't think it is by the way so this is
not my view I'm just saying if you
thought that Russia could kill a billion
people
maybe let's say you thought there was a
10 chance that the the Russia Ukraine
thing could kill a billion people either
through economic hardship or nuclear war
or both
so you got a 10 chance of losing a
billion if you were a rational person
how would you how would you compare that
to other challenges you do something
called an expected value calculation you
take the billion people that you might
lose you don't know what the odds are
but you might
and you say well the best guess is
there's a 10 chance of that so you would
multiply 10 times 1 billion
and that would get you 100 million
people
so you're trying to protect 100 million
people by funding Ukraine this is not my
preference it's not my view I'm just
giving you a view to show how things are
compared so if you believe that a
billion people are at risk and if you
believe there was a 10 chance of that
billion happening you would value it as
a hundred million people what would you
value the future offense and less well
you'd look at the past and then you'd be
wrong because the past
doesn't tell you what's going to happen
in the future but you'd probably say
well let's for example let's say it's
the same as a spin
70 000 people a year so 70 140 210 it
takes you a while to get up to 100
million right it takes you a long time
to get to 100 million people
so if Pence is saying that making sure
we don't have a 10 chance of losing a
billion people is more important
financially just financially only
financially not about how we feel or the
you know the human death toll or
anything like that but financially
if he can save if he can take that risk
of a billion people dying from 10 to
zero that's a better expense
at almost any cost at almost any cost
that would be a better investment but in
order for that to be a better investment
and keep in mind you all know that I'm a
maniac about fentanyl right I'm a maniac
about fentanyl so you're not hearing my
opinion you're hearing the proper way to
analyze the situation that's all and
then you would take your own estimates
and plug them into my model
so if you think the the odds of uh
people lost in Russia is zero then then
that would be your opinion so you'd say
I think it's zero chance of losing
people in Ukraine
but we're definitely going to lose more
people on feminine also that's more
important
that would not be crazy
that would just be a different opinion
here's what's the only thing that's
wrong is putting uh
what's not wrong is your assumptions
because assumptions are kind of just
reasonable guesses and nobody can know
so you could make a reasonable
assumption that's different from my
reasonable assumption but here's what
you can't do
if you want to be a rational person you
can't not use the right framework for
comparing two things
you can't do that you can put in your
own assumptions all day long and I won't
argue with them usually
but if you if you use the wrong
framework
I don't even know what to say
you can't compare the past of fentanyl
with the future of a potential nuclear
confrontation or a meltdown of the
economy either one all right
are we good so when I saw uh Tucker do
exactly that
that that's a gotcha question
right that's a gotcha when you say more
people have died of fentanyl no Russian
has killed anybody that is not that's
not a logic framework that's a narrative
framework that's propaganda
he's pushing his preference
which I agree with
all right so when I say tucker is giving
you propaganda not a logical you know
structure for you to make a decision
it's total propaganda
but it happens to agree with the
propaganda I would like to push as well
which is that fentanyl is more important
than funding Ukraine
by the way I I totally agree with Tucker
it's just the way he's selling it to you
is with a
um a non-logical structure
now I would argue
and I think this is this next point is
really important
if you if you can accept this next point
it will help you understand a lot of
what you see
in my opinion Tucker is brilliant
he's brilliant right whether I agree
with him or don't agree with him
he is brilliant I say the same thing
about Obama right
Obama you can agree with him or disagree
with him
but I think he's brilliant Bill Clinton
brilliant you know there are a lot of
brilliant people that can disagree with
Tucker is brilliant but he's also not as
stem guy
right I think Tucker has always come
through the communication you know read
and write and news kind of world
that that's an entire world where you
could take Geniuses geniuses
and put them through that system and
they wouldn't know how to do what I just
did
which is simply compare two things in
The Logical way
it's not obvious how to do that and it's
not because I'm magic or smart it's
because I took an economics path
and I got a degree in business you know
MBA and those two things teach you
specifically they teach you to make sure
you're comparing the right things
so I am literally literally a two degree
expert
on how to compare things
Tucker probably has zero degrees on how
to compare things so if he's compared if
if he's giving you an argument that's
more let's say more narrative more
persuasion and less logical structure
it's not because he's dumb and it's not
because he's necessarily trying to put
one over on you
it's that no matter how smart you are if
you haven't been taught that specific
skill there's no reason to imagine you'd
have it
it's not it doesn't come to you through
some god-like Channel
you have to actually learn it
and
so I I give everybody a pass who has not
learned that specific thing it would be
it would be like me getting something
wrong in science
I don't have a science degree
so if I get something wrong in science
it's not because I'm stupid
it's because I don't have a science
degree
and I wouldn't even feel bad about it so
if somebody said to me Scott you got
that sciencey thing you talked about
wrong which they say all the time by the
way it's a fairly common criticism and
when I hear that I always think the same
thing uh probably you're probably right
I'm probably wrong
because I don't have any expertise there
so and but and the trick or the Trap the
trick and the trap is to imagine that
just because you're bright and you've
paid attention to the world that you
could somehow know how somebody's
discipline works
sometimes
but that's a pretty sketchy assumption
that just because you're a bright person
you can overrule somebody's you know
discipline that they they went to
college for
yeah it's sort of like when I try to
overrule lawyers
you've probably seen me try to do that
overrule in the sense that you know I
have an opinion that disagrees with a
professional successful lawyer
I mean you shouldn't take that too
seriously
should you if my if my legal opinion
disagrees with the lawyer who you get a
bet on
I'd probably bet on the lawyer not me
so
you know every everybody who gets this
wrong there's a reason for it
there's a reason that journalists don't
know how to compare things because
they've never learned
it's not an accident
all right
um
well here's the thing somebody's asking
me about dershowitz versus Dan Abrams
when I watched Dan Abrams it's clear
that he's not giving legal opinions
it's clear that he's presenting a
narrative first and then he's making his
legal opinion fed it when dershowitz
gives the legal opinion he has proven to
us that he will accept
massive social penalty
to tell you what is really his opinion
so dershowitz has bought he paid for it
it was expensive dershowitz bought his
freedom
and he bought his credibility he said
what's the price what's the price for me
to be credible
and then he paid it Anthony pay it and
that you know he meant to agreeing with
some of Trump's legal stuff he paid the
price so if you show me somebody who uh
said what's what's the price
of giving you my actual real opinion
okay they'll pay that I'll pay that
price
that is credibility
doesn't mean he's right about everything
but it does mean he's not saying it just
to make you happy Dan Adrian Abrams is
telling you something to make you happy
because that's his job
right everybody on on that side of the
world
is making money by telling you what you
want to hear so that's not really a
lawyer opinion
Dan Abrams is filthy rich
good for him he must have made some
money
um
all right
this flag didn't hang itself
all right well that's all for now uh
YouTube thanks for joining and thanks
for being here for my 1 million Twitter
moment
it was a fun time and I'll talk to you
