yes that is the view
of my window in california and i remind
you
it is not foggy here that is
smoke and that smoke has been there for
i don't know a week or so gets worse
gets better
but everything beyond those trees that
are close to my house
i would normally be able to see for
miles and miles and there's a
there's an old town and ridge and a
valley there
but i can't go outside
i've got a little asthma issue
we are at we're on what would you call
it
house arrest i'm on house arrest
but i hope the rest of you can get out
and enjoy your day
and what's a good way to start the day
what would be the best way to get your
day off to a
great start yeah that's right it's the
simultaneous sip you got it right on the
first try
and all you need is a copper mug or a
glass of tanker chelsea style a canteen
jerker flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything
better except apparently the smoke in
california
and it's called the simultaneous step
and it happens now
go
that's right commenter
my most favored possession my
my e-bike i cannot use i literally
you know i barely can walk the dog you
know i take the dog out for
10 minutes to do her business and that's
it
i wake up in this house i go to sleep in
this house
and uh it's very much like being on
house arrest
but let's talk about some of the news
some of the things happening um as rush
limbaugh noted the bob woodward book
do you remember the bob woodward book i
know it seems like a long time ago
doesn't it
time time is so wonky now because
there's so much news
yeah you try to think back there was
this book by bob woodward i don't know
was it 10 years ago
oh no it was this week and
as rush limbaugh pointed out he had what
18 interviews with the president he had
all the
the time to write this book and the
biggest
the biggest bombshell he could make out
of all that work
and and of course the point is to come
up with bombshells so you can sell your
book
the best bombshell he could come up with
is something that the president has said
publicly and often himself
that that's it the best bombshell
revelation
is something that you can go to the tape
and say um
that's not really so much of a bombshell
because here's a
here's a video of the president
saying in public exactly what he said
privately
saying it to the world at a press
conference
and here's the date on it you can look
at it
and if you wondered if he took it
seriously even at the same time he was
saying
i'm being a cheerleader for the country
i don't want to panic you
and he was telling you that he was doing
that directly fully transparent
at the same time he had you know closed
travel
or release much of it from china to
signal that he thought it was
deadly serious so then the bombshell
comes out
and tells you those two things
which you knew were true you knew he
took it seriously
you knew he intentionally and
transparently was playing it down
admitted it in public at the time and
that was it
that was your best bombshell
uh honestly if we were even a little bit
objective about this president
the the first term of trump
you could make your case is the most
successful term of any president
i think you could make that case and
here's the interesting part
you could make the case that trump's
first term
is the most successful of any president
even acknowledging all the criticisms
you could even say all right let's just
say just for argument's sake
let's just say every single thing the
democrats said was true
every every criticism just said it's all
true
he would still still his accomplishments
are still so substantial they would
still be the best presidency of all time
and the criticisms are not all true
they're not they're not even close to
true they're mostly
a series of hoaxes and fake news
so now we have the news that uh
afghanistan
and the taliban the government of
afghanistan and taliban
are having some talks now i don't think
you can get
too optimistic about afghanistan you
know
finding peace but when you have said
that a little while ago about
north korea and south korea shaking
hands
didn't seem likely did it how about
the middle east breaking down in peace
you might not have seen that coming so
in the age of trump there is a magic
there's a magic thing that happens and
if you don't see it yet
you'll start to see it as it takes for
him and it goes like this
have you heard the word zeitgeist it's a
german word there's no equivalent in
english it has something to do with how
our
our common opinions of things
can change all at the same time almost
like we're connected
now we're not at least as far as i know
but there are some things that just
become
sort of true in the in the ether just in
the
atmosphere and everybody just sort of
wakes up the same feeling all at once
and here's the thing that i think trump
does
and you're going to see this accelerate
when trump took office even people who
didn't like him said
hey well at least he's a deal maker
right so the first part of the zeitgeist
was seven billion people who however
many pay attention to american politics
some billions woke up to say hey the
united states has somebody who's famous
for being a deal maker now he's not made
any deals
as president and some people will say
you know yeah
they'll critic criticize his business
past
but we would all agree that his brand
and now it's sort of in our head
is deal making right the other thing he
did was he made the impossible
look possible you don't have to do that
too many times
before everybody starts looking at the
other pile of impossibles
think about it just uh conceptually
you you believe in your mind there are a
hundred impossible things about the
world
we're never going to get anywhere with
north korea
you know we'll never get a better deal
with china
um the palestinian the uh the middle
east will never see any more peace
you know you could make a whole list of
things which you know to be impossible
you'll never get that stuff done and
then you see the president do one of
them
and you say to yourself whoa okay
didn't see that coming there he is
standing on the dmz
shaking hands with kim yeah we don't
have a deal
yeah he didn't give up his nukes but are
you still
worried about kim jong-un nuking the
united states
nope nope you're worried about that
one pretty close to zero from i gotta
say i was kind of worried about it
to be honest i was legitimately worried
about north korea for a while
and trump just took that away
and you say to yourself all right all
right he got lucky got lucky once
sure anybody can get lucky
then he drove the unemployment rate
before the chronovirus
down to levels that nobody thought was
even possible
it's one of the things that trump says
all the time my
favorite little throw away phrase that
he throws at the end of almost every
sentence
nobody thought it was possible nobody
thought it could be done
now i've told you this before each time
he says that
and you know how often he says it right
nobody thought it could be done
everybody said it was impossible each
time he says it it doesn't mean much of
anything right
it's just sort of a throwaway line but
trust me
if he says it five times a day for a
year
you've heard it 1500 times
and it starts to just carve a little
home in your head
oh trump
things that weren't possible before
trump things that nobody said could be
done
huh trump a new record
nobody saw coming huh trump
nominated for two nobel prizes
you know two nominations for the same
prize but two two separate nominations
huh and here's what happens to the
zeitgeist
once you've changed the thinking from
here's a hundred impossible things and
it will always be that way
and trump starts picking him off the
first one
okay that was just luck that was just
luck yeah you got one all right maybe we
were wrong
maybe it wasn't so impossible okay we'll
give you that you got one
then he gets another one you're like
okay okay it's just two things
you know i get it two things could
technically form a line
but it's just two coincidence
confirmation bias
probably is a little bit overstated
aren't you exaggerating the benefit a
little bit
uh let's not make too much of this and
by the way
that first thing you did that was so
special kim jong-un still has his nukes
so was that really a special
and then the third impossible thing
happens let's say
a peace deal between the you know israel
and the uae
and then you say all right that's three
that's three
i still think this is luck but you have
my attention you see where it's going
the the mental
structure that president trump has
designed into all of our brains did not
exist
before president trump
has rewired rewired
programmed several billion
human brains right in front of you
that really happened there's there's no
hyperbole in this statement
this is a legitimate fact president
trump
intentionally and right in front of you
while you watched every part of it
rewired billions of brains
right in front of you and how did he
rewire them
well there's a whole bunch of things
that people think about him much of it
bad much of it good
so certainly you know there's all kinds
of noise in the data right there's all
kinds of ways that people feel
it's this infinite variety of strong
feelings in every direction
but one of the things and the one that
mattered
the one that sits above all of that
noise
the one that makes all the others
unimportant
is this he can do
what can't be done he can consistently
apparently consistently
do something that just can't be done
you remember when he was uh at one point
he was the
uh poorest man in the world
because he was so far in debt years ago
in his business this
that he had some i think he had a record
for being like you have
the greatest negative net worth of all
time
and came back not only did he come back
to make his money back
but he's now president of the united
states and probably going to get elected
to a second term
so how many people thought that was
possible
how many people thought that after the
uh
the the access hollywood tape
dropped that he could still get elected
many people thought he would get elected
at all
so trump has created this non-stop
pattern
of yeah he does things you don't like
i'm not discounting the fact that he
does some things you don't like
that's true but he also does things
if you're going to be a little bit
objective at all you have to give me
this
you have to give me this he does things
you thought were impossible
and it's starting to look routine
he i think he's going to get maybe
20 or more of the black vote
in 2016 when i told people as i did
publicly i said you know i think he's
going to like set records for the black
vote not obviously not the election that
was over
but you know maybe the next one and sure
enough
how many of you thought that was
possible that he would set
records for black votes you didn't think
that was possible
and so by creating a a
a programming change in our minds which
we've changed that hundred impossible
things into
why do these keep happening
it looks like all these impossibles are
happening when trump signed the
most favored nations thing for
pharmaceuticals
what was the first thing you thought
when you said
wait a minute he just signed an
executive order that's all it was
didn't require a congress didn't require
anything
except the president and a piece of
paper and a pen
signing a document that lowered our drug
costs by
you know making it illegal for them to
charge us more than they charge somebody
else
and i thought i thought that was
impossible
because if it wasn't impossible why
didn't it happen before
now the obvious reason is that the
pharmaceutical companies were too
powerful
compared to past presidents apparently
the pharmaceutical companies are not
more powerful than trump
because he just he just waved his hand
and swept them off the table
i guess they're complaining i haven't
seen any complaints
i haven't seen any blowback i haven't
seen any negative
he'll never move the embassy the
american embassy to jerusalem
because that would cause all kinds of oh
he did it
okay i guess it wasn't impossible well
it wouldn't make sense to recognize the
golan heights because that
oh he did it he just did it that's done
okay i guess that worked out well it
certainly would be reckless and crazy to
send a drone to kill
uh general solomony i mean you do that
and you're going to create a giant war
in the middle
what he already did that lindsey graham
told them not to do that he said it was
reckless that's over the
line you did it anyway and
did it work out yeah kinda did
well but there's one thing we know if
you remove american forces from syria
that certain part of syria it was clear
that near the turkish border
we would be exposing all our kurdish
allies and the kurds would just be
slaughtered
right so it was kind of impossible it
was impos it was literally just
impossible
to remove our troops because we cannot
be the kind of country that would leave
our allies to be slaughtered so you've
been seeing all the news about those
kurds being slaughtered
nope didn't happen
it was impossible and then trump just
did it
right in front of you you can't it can't
be done there's no way to do this
without
these people all getting killed watch me
do it
and then he just did it and i think
we've waited long enough
to determine that it worked out right
now how many times does the president
need to do this
and now there's some talk that maybe
maybe saudi arabia
might be the next deal with israel which
would be sort of the big one
and that does make sense doesn't it
because you're seeing
you see that the smaller deals being
made because that tests the system
i don't think it's an accident that some
smaller countries
are going first you know to to just see
okay bahrain all right brain how'd that
go
everybody everybody okay with this
objections just just the palestinians
okay um now if you think back to 2018
when the president president trump was
being
clearly soft on saudi arabia after the
murder of khashoggi and pretty much the
entire world on the left and the right
said that's a mistake
there is a big old mistake trump
you can't just let that go you have to
come down hard on saudi arabia
you just got to do it there's no option
to this
and then he didn't do it and i said
wait a minute i think you're missing
something big i said to the public
i said saudi arabia now
owes the united states something big
so what president trump did was he
created an asset
out of nothing which is his one of his
greatest tricks
he created an asset out of nothing
the asset he created was saudi arabia
owes us a big big freaking
favor because trump did cover for them
he did it publicly he did it at the risk
and the cost of his own reputation
tremendous expense
tremendous expense for him personally
look at the amount of of just flack
that trump took for that public stand
which he was quite
he was quite consistent on not going
hard on saudi
now time passes what do we need from
saudi arabia
lots of things you know there are lots
of cooperation in a variety of different
ways
but the one thing that really really
could just
i don't just change everything is if
saudi arabia says you know
it's time it's time to work things out
it's time to be the adults in the room
it's time to do something with
with israel that's permanent and lasting
and just
sets up the region for prosperity in the
future
i feel like saudi arabia is going to
come online
really soon before the election it would
make sense because if you're saudi
arabia
here's what you're not going to do
remember
saudi arabia owes trump a favor
here's what they're not going to do if
they have any intention
of jumping on the the peace deal train
and it looks like they do
they're gonna do it before election
you're you're gonna see one of the
biggest
like you know dynamite explosions in
brains that you'll ever see
if they if they pull this in before
election and i would guess that's what
they're aiming for
we'll see if they pull it off
so uh that's my my big takeaway
is that trump has changed our brains and
changed what we think about
what is possible from what is not
possible he has absolutely rewired your
brain
to good effect i would say making us all
more entrepreneurial
maybe maybe a little bit more adept at
risk management
i mean you you get that for free just by
observing
because how many times have you now have
you now seen
something that seemed impossible get
done
now that's a that's a lesson that
transfers into your life
how many hundred things do you have in
your personal life
that you said to yourself well that's
impossible i mean
you know i'll work on the stuff that's
doable i'm not going to work on this big
pile of impossibles
maybe take a shot at a few i can tell
you that in my life
there have been quite a few impossibles
one of them you all know the story i
lost my voice
permanently i had an incurable voice
problem there was no solution
the rest of my life i would not be able
to communicate
in a way that people could understand
but
here i am a hundred thousand people will
listen to this
periscope eventually unrecorded as well
as live
and how do i sound right
so this is one of the great great
lessons and
this is the sort of thing that trump
will never get full credit for
and it's the i would argue the most
important thing he does
and yet it will be the thing he doesn't
get credit for is that he's changing
what you think is possible he's changing
that
do you know who else does that elon musk
elon musk is rewiring your brain
now he's not doing it as intentionally i
don't think
it could be but i don't think he's doing
it as intentionally as trump is doing it
trump trump is doing it you know for
effect
but elon musk is he's literally
rewired your brain from thinking that
there were a set of things that are just
too hard to do
to when are we going to the moon when
can i have my electric car
he just made the impossible sound
possible so you should keep an eye on
people like that
let's talk about winning strategies
versus losing strategies and we'll we'll
get into the news but let me
let me work up to it this way i may have
told you the story or not i don't know
but years ago many years ago i was in a
relationship
in which uh i would sometimes buy
flowers
for the woman and i was with i wasn't
married at the time but it was long-term
relationship
and i would give her just flowers for no
reason
now i knew from prior conversations
that it was more meaningful to her to
give flowers
when it wasn't you know valentine's day
or something and so i would give her
flowers and she would say
this oh what are you guilty for
and we would laugh because you know it's
sort of a standard joke
hahaha you must be guilty if you're
giving flowers now the first time i
heard that i thought to myself
huh yeah i guess it's just a joke and i
have a sense of humor
but i feel like i didn't get anything in
return
i feel like i got in a very small way
i'd be really trivial
but in a small way i feel like i got
punished
for doing the right thing it suddenly i
have to explain what i'm guilty for
like that had nothing to do with
anything i was just literally trying to
do something good
so the next time i brought her flowers
she said the same joke
and and some somewhere around the second
or third time it happened
i said look i gotta talk to you please
please don't say that please let me have
some
benefit for doing the thing you want me
to do
don't punish me for what you want more
of because you'll end up
with less of it i'm just like a dog
humans and dogs are not that different
if you give somebody a treat for doing
the right thing
and you do it enough you'll train them
to do the right thing if you penalize
them for doing the right thing
even if it's just a joke over time
it becomes a penalty that they don't
want to do
what happened did she stop doing that
joke
nope nope didn't stop doing the joke
and eventually it just killed my
feelings
honestly it just killed my feelings
so i'm not saying that's the one reason
that you know things did last
but watch this technique
in a lot of other bigger issues all
right let me give you some
examples bill maher was talking last
night about how it's such a bad idea
for the democrats to be let's say
running cover for looting so a lot of
people on the left
are trying to make the case that the
looting is just a property crime and
and it's it's appropriate within the
larger context
of how important the the issue is and
you can't really get
action until you've caused some cause a
little distress
on the people who need to act and so
nobody loves looting but it has its
place
his fits within this world it's okay
don't worry too much about the looting
is what you're hearing from the
democrats now given that
people only hear from their own side
like democrats listen to democrats
republicans hear from
republicans for the most part
what happens to looting
you get more of it right wouldn't you
always get more of
the thing you're getting complimented
for so the protesters are getting on
tv they're they're getting the fun of
the protest it looks like they have some
community feeling so they get good
feelings from it
and then their team the people who are
not protesting but rather
the support structure for them
compliments them
and basically rewards them for bad
behavior
now if you reward people for bad
behavior
what happens you will of course get more
bad behavior
not sometimes not well there's a risk of
getting more bad behavior no i'm not
saying there's a risk of it
i'm saying that a hundred percent of the
time the thing you reward
you'll get more of it doesn't matter if
it's an animal
doesn't matter if it's a human doesn't
matter if it's a democrat doesn't matter
if it's a republican
if you're alive like you can breathe
and see the world you respond to rewards
and penalties so let's take this
to uh to another level uh the
palestinians
uh reacted uh with uh unhappiness
about the peace that's breaking out in
the middle east all right
so take the concept that you'll get more
of what you reward
and less of what you penalize so now
israel
is working out deals for mutual benefit
with neighboring arab countries what
should be the
what should be everybody's approach to
that
reward right should president trump not
get a nobel peace prize
nomination he should he should would
that
make president trump more likely to try
even harder
to get more peace and more places yes
yes of course if he had been
penalized president trump for working
hard to get peace in the middle east
would he keep going would he put as much
resource and time into it
if he just kept getting penalized for it
no because he's a human animal
it has nothing to do with his
personality or character you
do more of what you're you're rewarded
for period
as soon as you think that doesn't apply
you're not part of the
the productive world anymore you're off
an imaginary land
rewards and penalties work so what did
the palestinian let's say the
palestinian envoy to the arab league
so what did he say about this deal with
israel in the uae he said uh
with all pride palestinians palestine
palestine wants a decision from the arab
foreign ministers blah blah
and then he goes to this quote but
palestine was
unable to impose that in other words the
agreement they wanted people
to agree to so the draft resolution
collapsed
and here's here's the key part this is
everything you need to know
he says and remember he's a he's an
envoy
so he can speak for the the government
so he's not just a guy he's speaking for
the government and he says
we have dignity murders prisoners and
refugee camps of glory
and this is enough for us
oh my god this is an official government
person
from the palestinian uh people
saying that their goal what they want
in other words that it's better to have
these things
better than peace better than prosperity
better than health better than life
is these things dignity martyrs
prisoners prisoners and refugee camps of
glory
and this is enough for us all right
if this is your approach
can you predict how it will go yes you
can
there's a hundred percent chance that
this approach leads to misery
misery there's no other opportunity for
you to talk about impossible it's one
thing to say something is you know
so unlikely it seems impossible it's
another thing to say
you're doing everything you can to to
fail
i mean if you made a list i say all
right let's make a list
of all the things you shouldn't do if
you want a better world for yourself and
your people
what would be on the list well how about
punishing people when good things happen
and rewarding bad behavior
let's say somebody does a suicide attack
yeah we'll reward them for that
yet their names will be famous their
family will be paid off
the palestinians have literally reversed
the lists they're penalizing the good
things
and they're rewarding the bad things and
they're getting
exactly the outcome that that predicts
exactly the outcome it predicts
what what would they do if they wanted
to reverse that
what would it look like here's what it
would look like
imagine the palestinians said you know
we like the fact that peace is breaking
out in some places
it's we're not getting what we want and
you know we're not
releasing on it we want some stuff but
we're happy that things are happening
congratulations just just think about
that
so that would be a reward to israel and
to the other arab countries
now palestinians just hypothetically say
you know we're among the worst affected
in many ways and if peace is breaking
out in all these places
why don't we just package this up and
and we'll be on board
but we also have a bunch of things we
want but you guys are doing a great job
and hey if we can help you out if we can
help your part of the deal work
can you let us know how we'll help your
deal work
and then what happens then the entire
middle east says
well we kind of like you guys thank you
thank you for being positive we didn't
expect that but thank you
and then the palestinians say
you know what would make things even i
know we we're never going to get the
right of return exactly
but wouldn't it be okay if sometimes we
could buy our way back
in so perhaps people who lost property
could be
compensated with reparations they don't
have to use that money to let's say buy
property someday i don't even know
what's legal
can they do that can they buy property
if you were a palestinian and you had
money
what would it take to buy property in
israel
and could you buy back maybe not the
same place you were
displaced from but could you buy back
property
in israel if you wanted to if you had
the money so
suppose the palestinians said look we're
going to be as positive and helpful as
we can be
but you know what would really make
everything work
would be a gigantic pot of money that's
partly reparations and partly
development
that would make the palestinian areas
just
super good and it's a big number i mean
i'm embarrassed to say how big the
number is but did i mention
that we're being really helpful on all
this other stuff
we're going to be helpful in every other
way
we we just want this big pile of money
it's kind of gigantic
but it would really solve this problem
once and for all now would any of that
work
probably not because it's the middle
east but my point is this
you don't have any chance if you're
rewarding
bad behavior and punishing good behavior
so
in the long run if that doesn't ever
reverse
they'll always have the same outcome
talk about black lives matter doing
basically the same thing you know what i
said with the
the riots and the looting that's more
but look what
um let me give you a mental experiment
uh sort of a thought experiment of what
it would look like
for black lives matter the group you
know the organization we're not talking
about the
the philosophy of it just the
organization um
what would it take for them to be more
effective what would it take for them to
reward good behavior and punish bad
behavior
well what are they doing right now right
now they're taking somebody who's
accused of a sex
crime who resisted arrest got shot
nobody's in favor of that um
but now that person will be a hero
with their name on nfl helmets
apparently
now if your black lives matter have you
punished
bad behavior or have you rewarded bad
behavior
you know the answer black lives matter
right in front of you and as publicly as
they possibly could
are rewarding bad behavior they're
actually making a hero
and as somebody who certainly was
at least half responsible for the
outcome
the tragic outcome you could argue that
the police officers
should have been smarter better better
trained
should have handled it differently maybe
i don't i'm no expert i'm no expert
i wouldn't say that's true for sure
because if the guy was going for a knife
you know what can you do
but maybe i'm open to the argument now
let's say if they reversed it
imagine if you will and this is
impossible to imagine but
just just go with it for imagination
imagine if
when the news came out that the the guy
the guy who got shot seven times had
been resisting arrest
and had been reaching for a weapon
and they had been incredibly accused of
some bad stuff
supposedly black lives matter said hold
on
our first reaction was an overreaction
if we're being honest
we we have a problem to fix but let's be
honest about it he brought it on himself
to some extent 100
maybe not maybe maybe the police have a
part in this right
reasonable people could say maybe
there's two problems here
and you needed both of those problems to
get the tragedy
if black lives matter said some version
of this
you know it looks like we've got to work
on
uh training our the people that we care
about the most
to be the safest and act the safest in
these situations
what would that look like that would be
a reward
when when the george floyd thing
happened uh
just about every white person in the
world was already sold
when you saw the the george floyd video
for the first time
no matter what you ever thought before
when you saw that thing you said to
yourself
ah okay i get it now that looks like bad
police behavior
i don't believe this necessarily would
have happened to a white guy
i don't know but i haven't seen it so i
got questions
if at that moment black america had said
do you see what we mean
look at the video do you see what we
mean now
can you help you know can we talk about
some solutions
white america would have said hell yes
hell yes
let's talk about some solutions we don't
want that we don't want it to happen to
you
we don't don't want to happen to anybody
how do we have less of that
so that should have been the first
reaction and it would have been very
productive
here's what the the reaction
should have turned into when we learned
that
he died of a fentanyl overdose or
probably it was an opioid overdose
it could be that the police action
exacerbated it
but it turns out that he may have been
lying to them
about whether he had anything if he had
told the truth
in other words if he'd done his part he
probably would have been treated more
like a medical problem and maybe even
saved
but he did everything wrong and the
police may have done things wrong as
well
and the combination was a bad thing
here's what black lives matter
should have done if they wanted
improvement
if they wanted it they should have
rewarded the right thing and the moment
they heard
that he was drugged up and that may have
been a complicated issue
they should have pulled back they should
have pulled back
and they should have said to the police
i think we owe you an apology
you still might need to do something
differently and we're not happy with you
but it doesn't look like you murdered
somebody it doesn't look like a
a race murder we don't know what this is
and we better get to the bottom of this
and we're not happy
but it wasn't what we first thought it
was
if black lives matter had said that how
would you
let's say you're not you're not in the
organization
how do you feel about that that would
completely change how i feel
completely i would say oh i get it
you're getting really worked up over
things that look real but as soon as you
find out that maybe the story was
different than you thought
you've now modified your opinion just as
you should
you you rewarded people for doing right
you punish people for doing wrong
yeah i could work with that i could work
with that
but that's not what you're what you're
saying there's some kind of need for
self-destruction that's built into the
black lives matter
movement it's built into the antifa of
course maybe antifa
is half the problem there it's built
into the palestinian
uh technique their their way forward
is they reward the things that are in
the wrong direction
all right uh i'm still shaking my head
over the story about robert mueller's
dozens dozens of people on uh
the russia collusion project they
claim that their phones have been wiped
and that they can't turn them in
to be looked at dozens now
you don't have to be a genius and i
don't think there's any disagreement on
this
that they did it intentionally
to hide evidence now it could be that
the evidence they were hiding is just
any personal conversations because
nobody wants anybody to look at their
entire you know phone history that'd be
pretty risky but
i think that they're going to get
completely away with us
it looks like it looks like this most
amazing
obvious mass coordinated crime
because first of all it's probably
coordinated you know there must have
been at least one person who said hey
i'm going to wipe my phone you might
want to think about this
i doubt they all just had the same idea
you know at once
so first of all there's some
coordination to
hide evidence and they should be the
people
that we most you know trust to
to keep us on the legal path this is
it's hard to put a number on how bad
this is
this is a 10 and a 10 in badness but
because
many of them are lawyers they know how
to do things without getting technically
in trouble
so as long as there's reasonable doubt
about how their phone got wiped as long
as there's a little bit of reasonable
doubt
i guess they get away with it but wow
does this
reduce your trust in the system
all right here's a question i have
you know these the antifa or the
protesters i don't know if it's anti-far
just the protesters
they have these snack fans
so literally like a big panel van
usually has lots of graffiti on it that
they park near the protests to feed the
protesters i guess they have snacks
and i thought to myself at least the one
i saw
it was in rochester or something i
thought new yorkers are getting really
soft because
if you if you're uh ripping up my town
i mean i i feel like if i were in
upstate new york
and i saw protesters destroying you know
the homes and busines well mostly
businesses
the people i knew or people i cared
about in my town
and i knew that they owned exactly one
asset
they don't own much except what's on
their bodies if i knew they had one
asset
these these snack vans and i'm watching
all these same people destroy
my town and then go back to their snack
van to get a snack
and i'm saying to myself well obviously
the the snack
snack van will be on fire in a few
minutes and i'm like okay
it shouldn't take more than 60 seconds
for that
and i'm like wait that that's the same
snack van
i i'm confused this neck van
is not on fire what kind of are
you
what kind of town do you have that
you're not going to go after their one
asset
if they park it right on the street i'm
not saying that
you know i never i never promote
violence by the way
so this is a just a question
why are the locals rolling over so
easily
i mean that snack van sort of is an
obvious target if you know what i mean
strategically speaking
i don't recommend anybody destroy any
private property or violence
it is just confusing to me
why that hasn't happened um
the atlantic which is now officially a
laughingstock
uh just decided to write an article
calling for the abolition of the nobel
peace prize
so it wasn't when uh arafat got it
they were cool with that it wasn't when
uh
when obama got it for doing nothing
they were cool with that but boy you
have two nominations for
president trump and uh well it's time to
cancel the prize
so if you can imagine anything that the
uh
the atlantic could have done to make
themselves look more ridiculous
it's it's hard to imagine all right
here's a
interesting development 19 black
families in in just in august just
recently
they purchased 97 acres in which they
want to build
basically a black town so 19 black
families
decided it's it's either dangerous or
i think they thought it was dangerous to
live among white people
because i guess they believe that they
will be killed by
cops or white people or something
now independent of whether that is an
overreaction
i kind of love the experiment part of it
i say this all the time you know there
there's nothing more useful
than experiments even if they don't work
at least it tells you what doesn't work
and the fact that they're thinking of
sort of building a town from scratch
i love that and they're also trying
something that hasn't been tried before
which is
hey it's 20 20. i mean there have been
segregated
places before but they haven't done it
this way
you know not in 2020 not with all the
advantages of technology
not with not doing it voluntarily
and independent of whether you think
this would be a great idea
or a bad idea could you at least join me
in agreeing that experiments are good
you know i hope it works maybe they
learn something
you may see a greater trend toward
segregated
groups but i feel like we could see it
differently now
you know if you if you go back a few
decades
the idea of segregated towns or
segregated businesses or segregated
organizations
is just pure racism and had to end
usually because it was the you know the
white organizations
keeping you know other people out
but now it's 2020. and we've
we've sort of for the most part i would
say
i can't think of an exception for the
most part anybody who wants to be in any
organization can do it fine
i don't think there are any clubs you
can't join or teams you can't be on
because you're your color
right so given that we've sort of
overcome you know for the most part the
biggest part of the hurdle
if you're doing it voluntarily if you're
voluntarily saying hey
you know we black people want to have
our own town and
see if we can make this work is that bad
i don't know your first reflex might be
that's a bad idea
segregation is from the past but this
isn't the past
can people choose to associate with
whatever people they want
whether it's by political preference or
by
age or by gender or by ethnicity
if they all want to yeah i mean somebody
says it's racist
is it racist if anybody can do it
in other words if if white people also
could create a little white town and it
wasn't racist they just
well i guess it would seem racist no
matter what
[Laughter]
i i guess i will accept the
categorization
that is racist by definition
but do you think that they should not
have the right to associate any way they
want
given that it's not a legal requirement
and nobody is forcing them to do it
there's no force
so i don't know that's a good question i
like experimenting so we'll see what
happens
what else we got here california has
gone fully anti-science now
which is so embarrassing so
our governor has decided to politicize
the fires
and says that climate change is the
obvious reason
and that now you don't even need to look
at the science anymore you can just look
out your window
and there's smoke and therefore
logically if there's smoke outside
logically can you see all the connecting
tissue
logically there's smoke outside and
therefore it's caused by climate change
you saw all the logical connection to
that right
it's there's a fire more fires
and therefore climate change is cause
did did you miss the part where it's
logically connected
no you didn't miss it it's not there
could it be there
well i suppose i suppose i'm not ruling
out
that some climate change might have some
effect in some way
i don't know what i do know is there's
no evidence of it
so we usually don't act on things that
have zero evidence
what evidence do we have well if you
follow michael shellin's
burger as you should you will know that
our forest management has been so poor
that the buildup of underbrush was
guaranteed
to create exactly the situation we have
so we have one explanation
which explains everything you see as
completely logical from beginning to end
oh we used to do good forest management
and we didn't have these problems
we stopped doing good forest management
which causes
forest fires big ones then the big
forest fires
happened after we stopped forest
management
which guarantees big fires happen
then the big fires happened exactly as
you knew they would have to
because you stopped forest management
which is the whole point of reducing the
fires
and our governor freaking idiot stood in
front of the world
in his with his smoldering background to
make it look dramatic
and said it's obvious the climate change
has caused this
no here's what's obvious it's obvious
that
fools who can't do math
have looked at the climate change
problem and closed down our only chance
in california to have electricity
which is to have you know natural gas
and
nuclear until something better comes
along
but he's anti-science about nuclear
anti-science about even just doing the
math
of what kinds of technologies are good
for the
good for the environment in the long run
which were not
you didn't understand anything about
forest management he's the guy in charge
he's the guy in charge and he seems to
be the only person who doesn't know
that poor forest management is a big
part of the problem
on top of that what about context if you
were to look at the history of
california and we can
you know reconstruct it from from
whatever
tree rings however we do that we can
know
that the forest fires we're experiencing
now as bad as they are aren't even
bad historically so if we didn't have
climate change in the past
and yet the forest fires were far bigger
back then or at least more destructive
he is so non-science
based that it is disturbing
all right um
and i think that's uh so here
here's a interesting thing developing
you probably all know jonah goldberg
right
conservative but not a big fan of the
president
and jonah goldberg was noting
on twitter that uh
i i think it was a uh mark levin tweet
he was responding to
and levin was tweeting somebody else's
article
noting that it seems that democrats
are prepping the country for a violent
coup
an actual military coup now jonah
goldberg
thinks that that is a ridiculous worry
it's sort of an absurdity it's overblown
risk
and that the democrats are not
intentionally prepping the country for a
military coup
under the condition that trump in their
in their view
under the condition that trump loses but
refuses to leave
office and jonah pointed out
when i commented on it he said
he said there's this is what jonah says
he says easily as much evidence
if not more that trump is setting the
table
to claim election is illegitimate you
guys meaning i guess me
you guys and the resistance crowd are
playing the exact same game
and pretending only the other side is
being irresponsible or dangerous
you all are and here's my take on that
i do i would agree with jonah's comment
that trump is also prepping the country
for the outcome of the election to be
illegitimate
right well you would agree with that
that trump is definitely warning us and
prepping us
and sort of getting you a little bit
hypnotized into the
idea that the election outcome might not
be dependable
or credible but here's the thing
when he talks about it he never talks
about the military getting involved
and so the default assumption
is that if there's some ambiguous
outcome
that the republicans would look to the
supreme court
probably or they'd suggest a redo
or a recount or something working within
the system
now is there a risk that you would get a
few more
months of president trump until the
system worked its
way out and we had a real outcome yeah
i suppose so is the president getting us
ready
for a murky ambiguous outcome that could
be messy
yes has he ever mentioned the military
no no there's
have you ever talked to any republican
who talks about using the military to
keep
trump in office if he lost the election
have you heard have you any legitimate
person
say you know even if trump loses the
election
i think he should just use his military
and stay in office
no no i've never heard anybody think
that would be a good idea
but have you heard democrats that say
out loud
in public that if the president
doesn't leave and they think the result
is that he should
that the military should step up and
remove him
yes they're saying it directly
they're writing articles about it
they're talking about it and they are
prepping the country
for a military coup i agree that
president trump is
prepping us for not trusting the outcome
but is he wrong about that is it wrong
to prep
people for something that's true i'll
tell you what's
true no matter whether the outcome is
accurate or not the country is going to
be a little iffy on it
it doesn't matter what the outcome is
we're still going to say
i'm not so sure and that had nothing to
do with trump well he
exacerbates it but it was going to be it
was going to be that way
anyway um here's what i think
i think that trump could make the
situation better
by saying look here's the deal people if
if if the election outcome is not good
the republican approach is to go to the
i don't know how this works actually but
whatever the process is you go to the
supreme court
you redo the election i don't know you
do some analysis whatever you do
some kind of audit of the system but i
think the president should tell us
what it looks like because the democrats
have told us what it looks like if they
don't get their way
it looks like they're going to be
pushing the military to make a move
i don't think the military will but it
looks like they might try to get that
done so while i don't believe that there
will be
any kind of a major coup in this country
it's definitely an option
and i think that the democrats are
putting the option on the table
that doesn't mean that they want it to
happen but they're definitely
opening the option
and i don't think it's the same in both
directions
all right that's what i had to do
that's what i had to tell you today
um somebody says no way it will be a
landslide
one of the things i heard about uh was
it michigan
and maybe wisconsin i forget which there
were two states
that somebody who knows more than i do i
wish i could
uh credit them but on twitter i saw
somebody noted that
some of those states have a lot of rural
voters
and by rural i mean don't have the
internet
so there may be a lot of people who are
not being polled because they're just
practically off the grid and it might be
the the number of people who are trump
supporters
dems are cheaters obama spied on trump
somebody says
all right just looking at your comments
before i sign off today
how did you like today's periscope by
the way
um completely uncharted territory
yeah we have we do have constitutional
deadlines
but suppose we don't meet them what do
you do i'd like to hear
i'd like to hear the what do you do part
um remember olinsky
you know i have great questions about
the linsky stuff
a lot of people get accused of using the
linsky
rules for radicals stuff and you can see
it
i mean you can certainly see that he
recommended this stuff
and you see people doing that stuff but
i don't know if it's because they read
that
i just don't know that i think maybe
just some things are obvious
attacking the other side whoever the
other side is
in every way you can attack them you
know mocking them
etc uh that just seems common sense to
me i don't know if you need a linski to
do any of that
maybe um
how about bill maher's comments on trump
more likely to win
well i didn't see the show i only saw
reporting about the show
but if bill maher thinks that trump is
on the way to win
you know i would look at him and i'd
look at
roger michael moore
and i would say they are two people who
represent
more the left who are a little bit
clearer-eyed
so if both of them
if both of them think trump might win
that means something um
well thank you you're all you're all too
kind to me
and yeah
just looking at your comments all right
that's all for now
uh maybe i should let this go just
because you're complimenting me what
remember i told you in the beginning
that people will do more
of whatever they're rewarded for you've
watched me doing these periscopes and
you saw how much you see how much energy
i put into it
why why do i put so much energy
into doing this it's completely outside
my field etc
and the answer is i got rewarded for it
so
when i was doing periscopes in which you
know the first periscopes i would have
25 people
but those 25 people would say hey i like
this
do it again and i'd say huh okay
25 people saw it three of them said i
liked it do it again
oh do it again and then you know 35
people see it and
four of them said they like it i'm like
huh i'll give this another shot
it's very powerful reward what you want
more of
and you will have a good life that's all
um
yeah not roger moore michael moore sorry
so oh let me answer this
was your sinus surgery worth it
it was life-changing life-changing
yeah just a complete transformation of
life i can breathe through my nose
my allergies basically don't exist
um you know my voice is different
my smell came back my sense of taste my
hearing is no longer
affected
yeah i would say on a scale of 1 to 10
it was a 10. very unpleasant you know
the process of going through it's kind
of unpleasant
but not as bad as i thought actually so
that's all for now and i will talk to
you later
