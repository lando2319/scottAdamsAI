hahaha
oh my God yeah YouTube you don't know
this I've been talking to the locals
platform but literally everything has
gone wrong this morning in the last 10
minutes I've had five major device
failures you know I had to grab my
device from another room and I'm firing
up different iPads and I thought finally
finally I've got everything working
you know
um on the locals platform we have just
we have now another problem just as I
was talking so two since I signed on uh
I don't know how to go private on locals
because the interface has changed so if
you would do me a favor during the
broadcast don't ask me to go private
please don't ask because there's no
place on this interface that has that
option
at least I can see
so I've got I've got a new interface
right now
um so don't ask
however you know how the first part of
the the show I always opened a drawer
and take out the little thing that reads
my uh my toast
the drawer wouldn't open
because there's something stuck in the
drawer
of all the things all right Matt you get
to go away
first down
goodbye
anybody else want to go away let's start
this first let's start by just blocking
people
it's gonna be that kind of a day all
right let's reset
reset
I'm going to open this drawer
and I'm going to take out that piece of
paper you ready all right
why was there a roll of toilet paper in
the drawer
but
there's a story behind it
what I normally do normally I read this
simultaneous
but today
today the simultaneous sip will be done
by AI
so AI this is courtesy the Twitter
account Prince of fakes
has made made a little uh extra
simultaneous sip by an AI now the AI
does not stop or I stop with just a few
items that you can sip out of it has
added many items that you can sip out of
it so now thanks to the hey gen app and
Prince of fakes
for a mug or a glass of tanker to
chalice or Stein a Cantina
all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass of tanker to chalice or Stein a

for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit that's true the thing that
makes everything better it's a practice
both old and new it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now on
cue go
all you need is a cup or a mug or a
glass of tanker to chalice or Stein I
can't shut up AI me
ah
all right well that was a little
different
a little bit different
but if you didn't notice I mean it's
hard to tell so you could probably tell
it was AI
but oh my God is it close now it's
really close
yeah anyway so there's one other thing I
was going to show you uh did you see the
dust up about Jonah Hill
anybody see that
uh Jody Hill
and I'll bet uh yes I I have a technical
problem so we'll be skipping this this
part of the presentation to the seventh
technical problem this morning
seven technical problems 10 minutes
it's a new record all right so we won't
be talking about that story but we will
be talking about U.S oil Productions up
according to the wall Wall Street
Journal
so sort of quietly
without noticing
oil production is zooming so that's a
little Story I mean it's good for
everything so oil production way up in
the United States specifically the
United States
so that's all good
um remember I told you yesterday that we
can't tell if it's getting warmer or
cooler
but we also can't tell if
if Russia is running out of weapons
before Ukraine is just the most basic
things
you know was the election uh rigged or
not rigged
did the vaccination hurt us more than it
helped us
is Ukraine winning or losing
is the earth warming or Cooling
pretty basic questions is inflation
coming down or it's going to be with us
forever are we in a recession or not
these are the most basic questions about
our reality we don't agree we're not
even close not even close to a Greek
so what happens to us when we don't
agree on the biggest facts
I'm not sure if it makes any difference
I'm not sure if we've ever known
anything
do you ever wonder if we've ever known
anything
my current view is that we were always
we were Dumber before but we didn't know
it I think we're way smarter now
but the problem is we're smart enough to
know what we don't know which is
everything that we're told by anybody
who's a professional
it's just the weirdest weirdest world
that we finally know we don't know
anything
it's sort of an uncomfortable place to
be but there we are
so Steve Malloy has a article in the
Wall Street Journal and as you know the
news has been reporting it's the hottest
two days in July or something like that
you knew there would be summer stories
about it's too hot because of climate
change
and Steve Malloy goes through all the
problems with how do you measure such a
thing
do you think anybody can measure the
actual temperature of the Earth
like even once even once do you think
that's a thing
and we've been told by our experts that
they can measure the temperature of the
Earth
sure
how exactly
is it because the the few places that
they have uh thermometers represents the
rest of the world
do you think that the the places where
the thermometers are that gets you a
good average
or does it just tell you that those
thermometers have changed
and do you know that a whole bunch of
the thermometers are not considered to
be accurate
and did you know that we didn't actually
have satellites measuring the air 125
000 years ago
almost everything about the way we
measure temperature is ridiculous
so to imagine that we even know if it's
going up or down we don't know
we don't know that
but we're pretty sure that somebody
somebody says they know
yeah the most basic question we really
don't know
well the Biden Administration is pushing
back on the court
that said that the government can't
coerce or you know push the social media
companies to censor but the Biden
Administration thinks that's very very
important that they still have that
ability
now we call it censoring
I'm sure they would call it giving good
information to the public
and making sure we don't have any bad
information
but how does that work out
it's never really worked out has it
now let me ask you this philosophical
question
if you had a friend
that's not the hypothetical part I'm
going to guess you have a friend
if you had a friend and you had some
knowledge that would definitely make
that friend less happy and maybe even
less safe
but it's the truth
would you tell them
you're pretty sure it will hurt your
friend there's no upside would you tell
yes yes yes yes yes yes why would you do
it what would be the point
why would you hurt your friend so that
you can feel good about your truth
how is that ethical or moral that you
would hurt a friend for no benefit to
the friend
the only benefit would be to you because
you feel like you need to talk
that's not the most selfish up
thing you've ever done in your life
that's actually something you think
you're proud of and you'd be you'd be
good with that you told them the truth
you hurt them permanently
and they can't recover
I mean they'll always have that
lawfulness and nobody got anything
except you felt a little bit better so
you felt a little bit better about
yourself
so for your selfish short-term benefit
you would destroy your good friend
and most people think that that's better
than not telling them the truth
all right so I'm not sure there's a
right answer here
because I like the truth
truth is kind of cool
but I don't like hurting friends
that's not cool
so it's sort of a uh you can't have both
things situation you can't have your
cake you need it too even though some
would say the point of having a cake is
eating it too
yeah there's no right answer
there just isn't
it's just one of those things you just
got to suck it up you either have to you
have to either be okay with the fact
that you would hurt your friend for no
benefit to your friend
if you're okay with that I'm not going
to complain
um or you're you have you care more
about your friend than you do about your
own need to get the truth out
I know I think I'd want my friend to lie
to me
now hypotheticals are always hard
but if if it's truly a situation where
I'll never it'll never make any
difference it'll just hurt me if I hear
the truth I really don't want to know
that truth
how is that going to help me
anyway just thought I'd ask so the Biden
Administration thinks it wants to be
responsible for
protecting you by telling you what's
true and preventing you from seeing
other things that they might think are
untrue but other people think they're
true
um so I guess when it comes to
government that's a lot different than
you and your friend
when it comes to government the
government has to tell us
would you agree with that if we take it
out of the domain of two friends and you
take it into the domain of a government
and a public
in that situation the government has to
tell you the truth they just have to
that that's you don't they don't get the
lie for your benefit
now we did see the government do exactly
that
Dr fauci told us that that those masks
even the n95s would make no difference
but he was lying now that's Complicated
by the fact that his lie was actually
true
so so he tried to lie
but he's so bad at I don't know I won't
say it that way he tried to lie but he
accidentally was accurate that the masks
wouldn't help you I mean overall they
wouldn't help you you know I've argued
that there has to be some small you know
some small change but it doesn't show up
in any of the big numbers so obviously
the masks were a waste of time for the
public
um so we've seen our government try to
lie to us for our benefit it didn't work
out
but it's a real thing so no I don't
think I want our government to to lie to
us
um and let me let me make sure I'm
getting your temperature correct
if your government knew that telling you
to the truth would cause a panic you'd
still be in favor of it right if you
knew it would cause a panic
you'd still be in favor
most people say yes
I see some notes okay some notes
yeah see
yeah here here's something I often say
if you took a hundred people randomly
from the public including from this
group and you said to him hey I got a
deal for you
you can be one of the elite now
you go what really I go yeah yeah we're
going to pick you from the public and
you get to be one of the elite you get
to make all the big decisions
so you'll no longer be the recipient of
the decisions from above you get to make
them your responsibility
for the you know the big decisions go
how many people would be happy with that
situation
even though you told them they'd be rich
and famous will you be rich and famous
you're one of the elites but you have to
make all the hard decisions because
that's what the elites do
most people would say no
the the vast majority of people would
say ah I like the money part
but could have the money without the
responsibility no no you can't you do
have to make the decisions somebody does
it's going to be somebody in charge most
people don't want to
do not want to so be happy that you'll
never have to decide whether to cause a
panic and kill people for sure
just so you can be honest
just be really glad you don't have to
make that decision because we're not
equipped for it we just don't have the
capability
all right um
Eric Schmidt who had been CEO of Google
is talking about the Drone aspect of the
Ukraine war and he's saying now what I
thought said at the beginning of the war
that the drones
the Drone seems to be making the
difference because there's a ten to one
difference in artillery apparently the
Russians have a 10 to 1 artillery
advantage
but the ukrainians are being pretty good
with their drones
um
and uh
so it looks like one of the things I was
wondering is about the anti-drone
defense according to Eric Schmidt the
ukrainians are losing as many as 10 000
drones a month
the ukrainians are losing 10 000 drones
per month that's a lot of drones yeah
they're mostly the smallest ones but
I don't know how many they're making
you know how many are being delivered to
them probably more than ten thousand
but apparently the Russian army is good
at knocking out the GPS guidance
so they do have
Electronics will knock out the drones so
that's partly why they're getting so
many but apparently now they're
introducing drones that don't need GPS
and can't be jammed
yeah they prove it the latest models
prevent jamming and operate without GPS
guidance
huh what do they do if they don't have
GPS guidance
I'm right again yes I'm right again
um so Biden apparently said we're
running out of ammunition when asked
about why we would give
these cluster Munitions which have been
called a war crime yeah I think even
Biden called these these weapons of
Warcraft
but we're going to give these to the
ukrainians which will be devastating to
their own public later and won't make
any difference to the war probably
but the reason that Biden gave just
flippantly as he was walking by is that
we were running out of ammunition
do you think we're running out of
ammunition I think what they meant is
artillery shells
so they were looking for something that
would be you know a rough substitute for
artillery shells and we just didn't have
enough now that doesn't mean that the US
doesn't have any
it means that we don't have any extra
but I feel like having extra would be a
good thing sometimes
um
so there you go it's a it's a drone War
I don't see any chance the ukrainians
will break through
not really do you does anybody think the
Ukrainian uh counter-offensive is gonna
is gonna break through and make a big
difference
at the moment it doesn't look like it it
looks like there's status quo
so we'll we'll wait for somebody who can
actually negotiate a deal
I just I just read a uh a story about uh
Donald Trump in the 80s uh negotiating
deals with the mafia
and when I saw the article I thought oh
the story is going to be that he did
some awful thing with the mafia right
that's what you expect and instead it
turns out it's just a mafia guy that
says Trump is a good negotiator
apparently Trump negotiated with the
mafia
just like he negotiated with everybody
else and not only that but they kind of
respected him for being in a tough
negotiator
so there was one story that they told
where he was going to buy some property
that was adjacent to one of his casinos
when he had casinos and the price was 8
million he shows up to the deal
and says he only has seven
and they're like well what are we going
to do now he said I only have seven
so it's seven or there's no deal
so they wanted a tool he said he'd give
him seven and they decided to solve it
with a coin flip
so they flipped the coin and Trump won
and he saved a million dollars
and the the mafia guy confirms that that
actually happened he actually saved a
million dollars on the coin flip
now when Trump says he's a good
negotiator
it doesn't always mean he's he tells the
truth during his negotiations right
because I'm sure he had eight million
dollars but
he does do some Innovative things he
cause he causes people so much
consternation that they just want it to
be over with
and they're like all right I just want
this to be over with seven Millions five
you know he just bothers them until they
settled
it works apparently it works
but it was interesting that that article
did not
include any sketchy activities by Trump
himself it was actually a story about
Trump dealing with the mafia and there
was nothing that Trump did wrong
in the story anyway that's interesting
did you see the video of trump attending
the uh the UFC fight
with Dana White
and the crowd just went crazy for him
all right he's shaking hands with Joe
Rogan one of the fighters gets out of
the ring to shake hands with him I mean
he was just walking it like a superstar
I don't don't ask me to go private again
you may have joined recently don't ask
today's not the day to ask I'll tell you
why later
yeah Rogan shaked his hand uh Rogan does
he really are you serious
you're not really going to keep going
and saying that are you
because we're I'm just going to turn it
off if you do
because it's just too disruptive
honestly I'm just going to turn off the
feed if you do that again
uh all right um
yeah that's it
exactly you get to go away too
goodbye
all right what else is going on uh
I feel like the news is not as fun today
it's all news like running out of
ammunition
that's like the least fun news you could
have well we're running out of
ammunition
um
so I saw Jonathan Turley
talking about uh katanji Jackson you
know the new Supreme Court Justice and
she was one of the dissenters
on the Supreme Court's decision and
affirmative action and in in her descent
she said
that for uh high-risk black newborns
having a black physician more than
doubles the likelihood that the baby
will live and not die
do you believe that now the con the
context was you want more black doctors
because black doctors will do a better
job of keeping black babies alive
now that was based on a study she didn't
make it up it's not something she made
up it was based on a study but here's
something I learned from Jonathan Turley
this will make your head explode
in the Supreme Court
if somebody introduces a study as part
of their argument this study is entered
into the record
but the Supreme Court doesn't have any
facility for checking if the study is
accurate or if it's valid
so the Supreme Court is a record of a
lot of studies that have been entered
into the arguments without pushback
no pushback now keep in mind that we
know that at least 50 percent of all
studies are not reproducible meaning
they're not true they don't actually
tell you something about the real world
50 percent
yet 100 of everything that's offered to
the Supreme Court just becomes part of
the record
because the Supreme Court doesn't have
the facility to say hey we're going to
check out that data right so they're not
judging the quality of your study
they're just saying well you said it
here's the record of you saying it we'll
put it in the record
that's it there's actually our lead our
system has no way to know that some
study introduced to the process is real
or not so when when Justice uh
uh katanji Jackson
was saying that there was some study
that apparently that said that black
Physicians do better with black babies
even the people who did the study have
since
retracted it
so there actually is no study
or let's say that the the people who put
forth that argument have decided that
the data was garbage
so that so here's the supreme court of
justice who in her dissenting decision
hugely important case
cites a piece of science that just
wasn't even real
it wasn't real and even the people who
presented it originally say it's not
real
and that was part of part of the Now
American record that our Supreme Court
used a study that wasn't even real
to make an argument
so that's a problem anyway the the
larger point is not about
Justice Jackson because apparently this
has been this has happened before it's
not the first time somebody referred to
a study that had been presented to the
Supreme Court that wasn't based on
anything real
so that's a big problem they're relying
on things that aren't real and they
don't have a way to check
what good is the Supreme Court if you
can just give them a fake study and they
don't know if it's real
doesn't that because if in fact let's
say it was true
let's say there was a study that said uh
that all the black babies will die if
you don't have a black doctor
or it's just something crazy
if the if the justices saw that that was
a real study they had scientists listed
on it and all that stuff wouldn't it
influence their decision
can you just make up stuff and show it
to the Supreme Court and they don't have
a way to check so they they just sort of
incorporated as well maybe maybe true
that's bad situation
all right
well
it seems to me that there wasn't much
else going on except this Joni Hill
thing
which I'm I swear to God I'm gonna I'm
gonna read to you because if you're not
following it Joni Hill sent me a text
message
to his girlfriend
in which he
I guess he put down some
what would you call it requirements or
some some red lines you know he said
what he would not be willing to put up
with
so let's see if we can find Jonah Hill's
thing here so I can read it to you
because I want to see if you think he is
being reasonable
there were differences of opinion
Jody Hill texts all right this should
pop right up here we go so here's
something Jody Hill sent to his
girlfriend and you get to judge
whether he was being unreasonable or was
she being unreasonable
right so here's what Jonah Hill actor
said to his girlfriend
plain and simple
and I think we I think you should know
she's a professional Surfer
and maybe a model or something but
anyway so he says if you need these are
the things he says if you need that he's
not the right partner for you right if
you need surfing with men
uh boundary listen inappropriate
friendships with men
if you need to model
if you need to post pictures of yourself
in the bathing suit
if you need to post sexual pictures if
you need friendships with women who are
in unstable places and from your wild
recent past Beyond getting a lunch or
coffee or something respectful and I'm
not not the right partner for you
now
this next part is important to the
message
because he's being very respectful in
this last part he says I'm not the right
partner for you if if you wanted to do
those things if these things bring you
to a place of happiness I support it and
there will be no hard feelings these are
my boundaries for romantic partnership
my boundaries with you based on the way
these actions have her our trust so it's
based on a little bit of their past but
he's also saying well here's my minimum
if you can't reach the minimum we should
not be in a relationship
Let's uh let's take a vote how many say
that Jonah Hill is being
um
reasonable let's say reasonable is it
being reasonable
I'm saying almost does everybody say yes
I feel like everybody said yes I see it
now
okay I do see some notes
now I did see online
um one pundit saying
that Jody Hill is obviously a narcissist
he's a controlling narcissist and that
he's a
doesn't have confidence in his ability
to keep a hot woman
because you know he has low self-esteem
or something
do you think that's the problem he has
low self-esteem
I mean I don't know if he does or not
but does he look like a narcissist to
you
does I don't know if you said you know
who knows who is and who is not but I
don't see it
I don't see that at all
I do see that the person who called him
a narcissist was projected
where somebody called them I'm not going
to name names but somebody called them a
narcissist online and you know gave
reasons and I thought my God that looks
like a classic projection
you know that's what a narcissist does
but Jonah Hill wasn't protected
where was he projected he was just
saying what was his minimum was
if she doesn't like it they go their own
ways
I I didn't see a threat I didn't see him
I didn't see him belittling her
was he be a little later
you know
it wasn't bragging
I don't I didn't see anything
narcissistic about it at all now you say
it's controlling is it controlling to
say what your minimum standard is
is that controller
I mean it could be you could see that it
could be but it isn't a control that's
inappropriate I would say it's
controlling
because he wants to control his own life
and his own happiness
is that a problem
I I could be pretty controlling
you know it if you put me in the right
context I'm controlling yourself
because I need to control my own safety
and you know well-being
but if you put me in a situation where
there's no risk to me I'm not
controlling at all
do what you want to do
yeah so I guess here's my
I guess my bottom line on him is two
people can make any personal agreement
they want it's gotten none of our
business
but since it was a big headline it was
trending I thought I'd weigh in
but I I think I'm going to take Jonah
Hillside
not that I would agree necessarily with
his standards but I agree 100 that he
can have them
he can certainly have standards and I
would consider him one of the best
communicators I've seen for somebody
who's in a relationship that was pretty
good communicating
I thought
yeah
Jesus Acts
what do you mean it's not his Acts
how did the text leak well I assumed
from her but I don't know
it's still gossip well I don't know it's
a text message
well every so here's the other thing
that I should warn you about
all news about public figures is fake
all of it
you know that right so whatever it is we
come to believe about Jonah Hill You
couldn't possibly know what's really
going on in that situation it is not
knowable by us you don't know who did
what to whom how much is unsaid you
don't know any of that
so
we I think it would be ridiculous to
judge those two people based on what
little we know about them so I would
just say rather than say it's about
Jonah Hill I'd rather say is it
appropriate just a general question
to State your specifications and say
this is my
you gotta have this
I think it's I think it's appropriate so
I won't make it about those two because
I think we don't really know what their
situation is
but as a general rule it's makes sense
um
he needs to procreate
all right is there any news going on
today that I don't know about
I will let me tell you this
I don't know if this is the Zeitgeist or
it's just me
and maybe it's just you too
but does it seem to you that nearly all
of Trump's negatives have been uh
they vanished
is that my imagination
because he's he's kind of you know the
legal process has has rung everything it
can ring out of him right the
there's nothing that would happen with
let's say a woman making an accusation
that would make any difference at this
point
so I think he's free of all woman
accusations the only played that wrong
I think people are starting to think the
election wasn't fair or they don't know
if they can tell one way or the other
oh I wonder if the page didn't print out
um
so there's an argument that I made on
Twitter
that in my opinion stops the discussion
about the election denial
and I saw somebody else tweeting it
around today and it goes like this
if the election is not 100 auditable
how can anybody know if it was fair
right you didn't check the code you know
we don't know if anybody
don't have any we don't know if anybody
threw away any ballots before they were
counted how would you know how would you
know if anybody threw away a box of
ballots
because they were from a zip code that
was going to vote one way or another how
would you know
is there any way to know
I don't think so so but whether those
are good examples not I think you'd
agree that there are a number of places
you can't audit
so if you can't audit it nobody can know
and
but the one thing you can know is if you
have a situation where there's lots of
people involved in the high stakes and
it might be possible
that over time it will happen
so the one thing you can guarantee is
that if it hasn't happened it will
happen for sure because the system is
designed to invite it by its it's
inaudible nature it's an invitation
so the only thing you can know is that
it has to happen
you can't know when or if it did
now here's what's different about this
argument
in my experience it makes people simply
shut up and walk away
almost any other argument you make on
any other point people will stay there
and argue
for example on abortion
the best argument you could make if
you're a republican is we push the
decision closer to the individual that's
the only thing that happened
you don't want your federal government
to make decisions if you can push them
down to to get as close to the
individual as possible because it's life
and death
you know you want to be as close as
possible to the decision maker now that
takes a while for each of the states to
you know work through any changes they
need to make but it gives every state
their own little individual best case
scenario
now if I were to say that that's a
pretty good argument from a republican
perspective it'd be a good argument but
it won't make anybody stop arguing
right yeah have you ever made anybody
stop arguing about abortion it just
doesn't happen because it's a life and
death and people have different opinions
about where life begins and that's it
so you can't solve that one
but but trust me if you say the election
can't be fully audited therefore no one
can know if it was true or not but on
top of that you can know for sure that
it invites rigging so if it hasn't
happened it will happen for sure because
that's what the design guarantees design
is prediction
design
is prediction
if you designed a road
uh there was like let's say you designed
the road with tight turns and a speed
limit of 100 miles an hour and no
guardrails
what would happen
you could predict that design would
create people driving off the road to
their death
it's not a guess
design is prediction
if you decide an election that can't be
fully audited
I will tell you what will happen and I
will be right every time
I just don't know when right the same
way I don't know which specific car will
go off the road I know the design
guarantees cars go off the road
if the baby's heart is beating it's
murderer it's murderer
no if the baby's heart is beating it's
killing
murder would make it would mean it's
illegal by definition it's just what the
words mean
if you want to make that argument you
could say it's killing but you could not
say it's murder unless it's actually
illegal
not that that changes anything
um
all right
you think murder predates the legal
Maybe
we've got it covered yeah
uh you should start a God's debris
religion
the last thing I want to do is start a
new religion
did a little word thinking yeah that was
it's not worth thinking
um if it's the difference between what's
legal and what's illegal
that would be a good use of word
thinking
there's a difference between killing
somebody illegally and killing them
legally and that's not exactly just the
words you use
one goes to jail and one doesn't
all right
um
let's get rid of you
rich
goodbye rich
you were gone
sound of Freedom movie so I haven't seen
the sound of Freedom movie
um but I understand it's based on a real
person
real person so
uh having understood that
I think I would rather
maybe read about the summary of it
I can't even imagine watching a movie
yeah I'll probably watch
Mission Impossible movie this summer
but movies
the
like why would I watch a movie about
something horrible for two and a half
hours
who wants to put themselves in that
situation for two and a half hours so I
don't recommend watching it but I do
recommend maybe finding out about the
story in some other way
um
do not watch depressing stuff
Hill's new girl what
um you can find out about the story by
watching it okay I don't I feel like
you're not listening
it's interesting to see people defend
the trafficking of children
you haven't seen that
you haven't seen anybody defend the
trafficking of children
that's not a real thing
all right
we talked about Trump at TFC
um
I don't know about that adrenochrome
harvesting stuff I don't believe that
all right here's a question for you
on the cocaine found in the White House
now as I've told you
pretty much all powder drugs in 2023
are cut with fentanyl
now this was reported as cocaine some
kind of cocaine stuff not Fentanyl
but here's the question that the Press
hasn't asked
was there fentanyl in it
the press needs to ask that question
directly
ask it directly so you can put them on
put them on record
because I think the odds of it not
having fentanyl in it are
five percent
probably five percent
it's one thing for them to say oh they
said this is in it it's very different
if you say I want you to tell me there's
no fentanyl in it tell me there's no
fentanyl in it
because I don't think they can
and I think they're keeping the fentanyl
out of the press because that would make
the story worse now let me let me say I
don't think I've said this before so
that's on me
I don't really care whose it was do you
I think it's probably not Hunters
probably not
and I don't think it matters in any way
to anything doesn't matter to me doesn't
matter to the country it doesn't matter
to Hunter it doesn't matter anything
it's it's suspicious the way the White
House is handling it
but it's a you know political football
so they're trying to do what they can in
the summer
uh and probably it's a summer story you
know it's just something you talk about
in the summer that you wouldn't care
about in January
but
I don't care about Trump's boxes I don't
care what's in them at all
it doesn't make any difference to
whether I'd want him to be president and
I don't care about the cocaine in the
White House
makes no difference to me
it doesn't affect the next election
probably they're probably you know 80
percent of the people going to the White
House have used illegal drugs
that's my guess
probably 80 percent of the residents
have used illegal drugs so finding some
oh okay it was a mistake blah blah Don't
Care
well if it's pure cocaine then the
second question should be
could you give us a source
because I think you could sell that
you you could sell the name of somebody
who's selling pure cocaine because as
far as I know nobody knows how to find
that person
the the people who actually do drugs
they can't find that
you think you could go on to the you
know just work your dealers and you'd
find some pure cocaine
in 2023 I don't think it's a thing I I
think that's
just
that's just done
I think it just all is cut with fentanyl
now now that's what I'm told
I don't have personal experience but
that's what I'm told
uh it does look like an OP
um but I wouldn't even care about that
right because it's an OP that's doing a
thing we shouldn't care about we do
because it's a political season but uh
we shouldn't so
if it was an OP it was a smart one
because it made us talk about it but I
don't think it matters
do we have apathy or do we have so many
things to be outraged about that we
can't we just don't have enough outrage
to go around
yeah
um
it's in every drug right you're right
six years now
thank you Cloud man
uh is your camera set to why is the
camera doing poorly
oh you notice
oh it's my eighth technical problem I
don't have my lights on
I had eight technical problems in the
last 10 minutes
of my getting ready for this
eight separate problems look at this see
how it looks if I turn the lights on
I don't know how you could have minutes
that many things go wrong
that was that
a little better
that's a whole better thing I just
assume people don't like looking at me
anyway
so I don't really think about it I just
assume people listen to it and they
don't look at it I don't know why you'd
look at it I mean I look the same every
time you look here I am
I'm not even dressed differently usually
there's not much to look at
that's too bright now
all right that's all I got for you today
I'm going to go do some other things
have a good Sunday if you were looking
for the today's uh Dilbert Reborn
you may have been looking for it
another problem it's another problem I
just discovered in the last 10 minutes
it exists but you haven't seen it so
I'll just now I would put I would
publish it as soon as I get off except
my computer's not working
so my main computer is not working my
iPad my sound
