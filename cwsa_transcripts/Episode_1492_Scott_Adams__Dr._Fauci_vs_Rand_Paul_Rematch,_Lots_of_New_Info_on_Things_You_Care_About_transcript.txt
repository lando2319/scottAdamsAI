good morning everybody it's time for one
of the best no hold on the best thing in
the universe it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and it's going to happen
really soon
like it's happening now really
uh but the simultaneous sip is coming up
also and all you need for that is a cup
of mug or a glass of tanker jealous or
style the canteen jugular flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamines of the day the
thing that makes all of your receptors
receptive it's called the simultaneous
Sip and it's going to happen right now
go
ah divine
delightful
well a little note to the locals
developers uh looks like your new
version is working I like the new
options but I can't see myself
so my self-image
is about 10 of the lighting value it
normally is
so you might want to take a look at that
uh in the news El Salvador today became
the first country to accept Bitcoin as
legal tender
so does that mean that Bitcoin is here
to stay
it kind of feels like it doesn't
uh I do not make recommendations
for crypto or finances in general so
don't get any Financial uh advice from
me but it should be noted
that the thing that gives any currency
value
is
is whether or not uh
a country will accept because if a
country will accept a cryptocurrency to
pay taxes then the cryptocurrency will
always have value as long as there's a
country that will accept them because
even if you didn't have any reason to
pay taxes in that country the people who
do they need Bitcoins so they might have
to buy them from you to pay their taxes
for example that's a bad example but the
point is that if you can find one big
country that's taking Bitcoins
it goes a long way to making it
permanent
uh you know one country isn't enough
probably but it seems like a big step I
think we've got to keep our eye on that
there's a billionaire looking to build a
city of the future
I think this is going to be the next big
big thing
as in so big you can hardly believe it
big as big as climate change
as big as maybe even the I don't know
the energy Market I mean it could be big
and that is uh designing a city
because right now we we Design Homes we
design rooms we design products we
design cars but you know what we don't
design
the city
because the cities tend to just grow up
over time you know they they tend to be
near a port
evolve in whatever way they evolve so
you end up with a completely unlivable
urban center
now suppose you started with a green
field
um and you started from scratch to make
everything work better
one of the things that they're building
into this city of the future should it
be funded I don't think it's quite fun
yet
uh would be that you could get to
everything within 15 minutes
so your work your shopping everything
would be within 15 minutes
imagine being close to everything you
need
yeah in today's world people are
commuting two hours a day or more quite
fairly frequently but imagine if you
didn't have to do that then imagine if
you made everything
eco-friendly and you designed it so that
it would be a natural way to socialize
with your neighbors instead of scurrying
in and out of locked doors so there's a
lot we can do there I think that this
redesigning cities from scratch
could be the biggest economic driver of
the next hundred years so that's that's
my big prediction that designed cities
will be the next big big big thing
because remember there are a lot of
billionaires in big companies that can
no longer do small things take Apple
computer Apple computer is so big
that if it takes on a new line of
business
that new line of business has to have
potentially an enormous Revenue
or else it's not worth it to them
because they can't do little stuff
little stuff's not worth the time
so as you have these Mega corporations
and mega rich people like you know musk
and Bezos they're going to look for
stuff to do that is the size they needed
to now musk and Bezos are looking at
space
because space is one of those few things
that's big enough
you know you you can put a lot of money
into space and maybe the returns will be
worth it
but building a city is something you can
do on this planet that I think a lot of
big billionaire types and big companies
are going to get interested in it all
right here's some new information on uh
breakthrough coveted cases when you're
vaccinated
were you under the impression
that being vaccinated didn't make much
difference in terms of whether you would
catch the virus now you did understand
that if you had a vaccination your odds
of getting sick you're desperately sick
from the virus were low I think
everybody do that by now but you still
thought you could get it
which is still true and you still
thought that maybe you could pass it
along just like somebody who had not
been vaccinated turns out that's not
even close to true
and it was confusing because we thought
that uh vaccinated people had as much a
viral load in their mouth and nose as
unvaccinated people maybe even more
and so logically you said to yourself
wait a minute if these vaccinated people
have all this virus in their mouth and
nose they must be able to spread it and
sure enough they can
but the odds of spreading it if you're
vaccinated are just vanishingly small
or the actually the odds of getting it
in the first place if you're vaccinated
is about one in five thousand
and it could be as low as one in ten
thousand so if you're vaccinated you can
still get the virus but your odds of
getting are you know vanishingly small
vanishingly small so small that you
could actually ignore it
I mean it's small enough that you don't
even need to put it in your
consideration
but it exists so that's the New York
Times David uh leonhardt did an article
on that and uh one of the takeaways is
that the amount of viral load in your
mouth and nose
probably is irrelevant
When comparing vaccinated versus
unvaccinated probably doesn't make any
difference because in the real world
they can't find the difference
well there's yet more information
telling us that narcissism works
there's a new paper by Italian
researchers
they found that when people have a high
degree of narcissism
they are far more likely to be promoted
29 faster in their career progression no
surprise right people who are
self-promoters and tell you that they're
awesome and they did a great job
people believe them and then they
promote them so being a narcissist is
actually uh
it's actually a benefit
it's a clear economic benefit
now I think that's why narcissism is not
called the mental disorder
because if you call it a mental disorder
it suggests that it's bad for the person
who has it
but it doesn't seem to be it seems to be
maybe good for the person who hasn't
they don't mind at all it's just bad for
the people around them
so I think it's called a a personality
disorder uh narcissism is as opposed to
a mental disorder
so here's uh the CNN's anecdotal
persuasion for the day I've been telling
you that every single day they'll do it
one and probably only one
story about somebody who wishes they'd
been vaccinated darn it and sure enough
there's a Nevada mother Christina Lowe
is urging others to get vaccinated after
losing her husband to the virus saying
saying that they thought the virus was
quote a political game
that's right
people dying from the virus
who once thought the vaccination wasn't
fake and that the virus was not even
real
one of these stories every single day
now when I told you that CNN was going
to run one of these stories every day
did you believe that it would really be
every day and that it would be a
different story same story but different
every day just one
I'm reading them out every day right can
you predict that tomorrow there will be
a story about somebody just one just one
story on CNN's page about yet a new
person who wishes they'd been vaccinated
because their family member died
so look for that
um
Michael schellenberger is uh
dunking on the renewable energy people
in in Europe
and points out that uh Britain and
others are burning more coal
lately because natural gas prices went
up
that's one of the reasons so they had to
they had to start burning more natural
coal
but there was another reason that they
needed a lot of natural coal
turns out they have a lot of windmills
and Great Britain
and the wind didn't blow much this year
yes natural coal that's right I said
natural coal and I meant it
the kind that comes right out of the
ground
so
um
one make of the fact that the wind might
stop blowing
what
apparently there's a pretty big
difference from year to year about how
much wind do you get
I don't think I knew that I mean I knew
that hurricanes can differ but I would
have thought that if you took the
average of the wind of every day for a
year
it would look a lot you know one year
would look a lot like another year but
apparently not apparently you could have
a windy year and a non-windy year
so
that's a problem and then I ask you this
question
with climate change
shouldn't it be windier
can somebody give me a fact check on
that
If all we're talking about lately is hey
that big storm must be climate change
and that hurricane must be climate
change and that flood must be climate
change and maybe they are I'm not saying
they are or are not but if those are all
climate change
wouldn't the lack of wind
quite logically be at least you would
suspect
had to do with climate change
now my instinct would be that climate
change would make the wind stronger
because it would be more more
differences in temperature
yeah this is my dumb non-scientist take
that probably it creates more imbalances
and is it not the imbalances of
temperature that and pressure that
causes the wind
I'm not sure I know what I'm talking
about so
put a lot of skepticism about everything
I say about weather but it
if every negative thing that happens in
in the world is because of climate
change
why not the lack of wind
I mean I it should make some difference
right climate change should change the
wind one way or the other it's not going
to be the same will it
so it's either going to make it better
or worse for windmills and I think that
that's probably something we should
understand
um you may remember that uh Naval
ravacant on on one of my early live
streams
indicated that addiction is probably
going to be the big challenge of the
future now he was talking about drug
addiction but I think it's bigger than
that or actually maybe he wasn't talking
about just drug addiction but I'll
expand it anyway because we're addicted
now to everything from phones games
drugs fast food social media
and
here's the real problem
that the technology for getting somebody
addicted
to anything is way way better than it
used to be
so you can get somebody addicted to food
by manipulating the amount of sugar fat
and salt in it and there's a formula
which is known it's known to the food
experts that if you hit the right ratio
of salt sugar and fat
it's addictive
that's you know fast food for example is
addictive and so that's that's an
addiction that we we can only learn to
make food like that because our science
is better
in the past it would just be an accident
if you made something that came that
turned out to be addictive but now we
can do it every time you just keep
testing until you have it and then you
release it
likewise with games and videos and
anything you consume online we now have
the technology to find out exactly which
content will addict you
not just Addiction in general but how
much will get you
all right that's important what about
porn
no longer shows you generic people doing
generic and naughty things
porn can find exactly the thing you want
to see
it'll find you a redhead doing God knows
what
exactly what you wanted to say
you know wearing a pearl necklace and
heels
you name it no matter how specific you
want to get
you can probably find it and if you can
find exactly what you want for porn
versus some generic stuff that works for
everybody a little bit
you're going to get more addicted
so our ability to find out what addicts
people and then apply it in a commercial
sense is off the charts right now we're
really good at it and that's a challenge
so addiction is going to be the number
one problem drug addiction alone killed
93 000 people in the U.S
this year
drug addiction killed 93
000 people
just this year it's a new record
where's it come from Mostly China
passing through the cartels after they
process it at least the fentanyl portion
of it
so yeah we're gonna have to learn to
deal with addiction and we have not come
to grips with that yet I mean I think
we're looking at addiction as
something that applies to each
individual category
so there are people looking at online
addiction there are people looking at
you know drug addiction but I think we
just need to understand that technology
has reached a point where we can make
anything addictive
right any category not any product but
any category we can make addictive
uh and what's that do to people what's
it do to your illusion of free will
Rand Paul is having a good day
you might recall that Rand Paul was
accusing Dr fauci of being uh one of the
people involved in getting funding
that ended up at the Wuhan Institute of
virology
Dr fauci said that is 100 false that did
not happen Rand Paul said well it's
totally true that we've got the receipts
well today there was a new story came
out was it in the I forget where it was
but a news story came out that basically
confirmed what Rand Paul had been saying
that the funding American Funding
through fauci he thought she was part of
that process
um did
did in fact get to the the lab and it
did in fact
specifically include gain a function as
it is defined now uh The Intercept yes
thank you it was The Intercept who has
that uh story today and by the way you
have to watch Glenn Greenwald go off on
The Intercept that's his old publication
I think he was a co-founder but he's
just tearing them apart for hypocrisy
and you know it's really fun to watch
him rip them apart
um but anyway it looks like the report
completely agrees with Rand Paul
the fauci was part of it now what will
fauci say in response to this will fauci
say well you got me you got me now I did
fund that stuff
no because I don't think they're talking
about the same thing I think they're
using words differently
I believe that fauci
talks about gain function in a uh more
weaponized way whereas I think the
science talks about gain a function as
anything that acquires a function
doesn't doesn't mean it's weaponized
necessarily
so I think he's just playing with weasel
words to say he wasn't involved now
let's say he was involved let's say the
reporting is accurate and he was part of
approving some money that went to the
Wuhan Institute of virology
um
let's say let's say that uh you know
Rand Paul is completely correct
I'm not so sure that that's as damning
for fauci as it looks
um I'm not a fouchy supporter per se but
also not the biggest critic because even
the things that I know he did wrong such
as lying about masks in the beginning he
told us why
and he actually had a reason
now you could argue that the reason
wasn't good enough he was trying to
protect the supply of n95 masks for
health care workers but I think it was
good enough I don't actually ask my
government not to lie to me I do ask my
government to lie to me when it matters
right if it's for my benefit yeah lie to
me please please please lie to me if
it's for my benefit as a citizen
and I think that was one of those cases
it was just a weird case we're lying to
the public
that might have been the best solution
so I don't even fault fauci for you know
blatantly lying to us about that it did
however
destroy his credibility
so he had a reason
and it was a pretty good reason
but it did destroy his credibility so he
paid for it
um and actually I think you'd have to
you'd have to give him a little credit
for that a little bit of credit for that
I think
now you can criticize him all you want
but he did make a tough choice in a
leadership role
and whenever I see a leader make a tough
choice meaning a lot of people aren't
going to like it
I always say to myself it might be a
mistake and it might not be but at least
damn it it's leadership
at least it's leadership you know you
gotta have that
but they do make mistakes of course
uh does he get credit for deceiving the
administration well I'm talking about
deceiving the public
um
all right so I'm going to give Rand Paul
the win for this week I I feel like Rand
Paul's claims have been substantiated so
Rand Paul for the win
um
looks like the Texas abortion law in
which citizens can sue a an abortion
provider which is a weird law I don't
quite understand how they can do that
but I guess they got away with it it
passes Supreme Court muster but mayor
wheeler of uh Portland
said that the city council intends to
vote on emergency resolution so that the
city of Portland won't do any business
with Texas or and its employees won't
travel there in business
to which I say how often were Portland
um
employees
employees of the city how often were
they traveling to Texas on business
is that even a thing do you ever need to
go to Texas on business if you work for
a local city
I know it feels like this is purely
symbolic
but as somebody smart pointed out by
Texas
making the abortion law a big topic
they may have screwed Republicans in the
next election
because it's going to make the next
election about abortion
and as the election is about abortion
Republicans lose
so I don't think they wanted to make it
about abortion but that's what happened
um you may be aware that I have been
saying for a long time that
um
systemic racism and structural racism
are real
and the biggest source of them is the
school system which doesn't adequately
educate black citizens and others as
well but if we're talking about
racist outcomes let's let's just keep it
simple and say our schools are not
adequately educating black citizens and
that is a serious serious
ethical as well as practical problem
I mean ethically it's just
is is beyond imagination
it's so unethical immoral I guess I'd
say it's immoral
um and just deeply immoral I mean it's a
moral at a level that it's hard you know
short of actually killing people
it's hard to find other topics that are
as immoral
as the fact that we don't adequately
educate
um black people to the way that we
should
so
Wall Street Journal article today Bill
mcgurn writing for the Wall Street
Journal
uh basically points out that the real
structural racism is the school system
and of course what is the what is the
big problem with the school system
well the biggest problem is that the
teachers unions prevent competition and
where a competition is prevented nothing
ever grows we know that I mean there's
there's no way around it so here's the
only thing that I would point to as
important
is it going to enter the mainstream
thought
that teachers unions are the main source
I'd say 75 percent just sort of
subjectively uh is it going to enter the
mainstream thought that the teachers
unions are the cause of systemic racism
75 of it
because it's now it's a it's a major
article in the Wall Street Journal
but guess what
Larry Elder running for uh governor in
the recall election in California
is quoted as saying quote the number one
obstacle to school choice is the
teachers unions
and then he points out who is the number
one funder of his opponent that would be
Gavin Newsom
the teachers unions
so Larry Elder is now also making the
case and he's I'm sure he's made it
before but the case is becoming a little
more prominent
that the teachers unions
are the problem
and you're seeing it in two different
ways on the same day
so I do you know how the the Zeitgeist
Works have you ever heard that word it's
a German word that we use in America
zeitgeist
uh and there's no direct English
interpretation
is that true I don't know if that's true
but it's a word we we use that says
there's just an idea that's in the air
and everybody starts thinking the same
way and you're not sure why
this might be one of those
but it might also tell you why why
people started thinking of things at the
same time because I'd like to think it's
not a coincidence
that
people with big platforms who are
persuasive are trying to make the
zeitgeist
see the teachers you says the big
problem for systemic racism and other
other reasons
so I wonder
is the Zeitgeist real
or is there always an influencer that's
just making the Zeitgeist what it is
does it just happen on its own
sometimes I think it must but I also
think that sometimes there's a there are
influencers behind the curtain
and you don't know why you're thinking
what you're thinking but somebody caused
you to think
um
why don't we know what makes a virus go
away I come back to this topic all the
time because the more we learn about you
know coveted and viruses in general the
more mysterious they get
instead of getting smarter I feel like
we're getting Dumber
it's like there's as much misinformation
about viruses as there is information
um but I'll tell you what my guess is so
I heard somebody smart on Twitter say
that viruses go away because they mutate
and they favor mutating towards
something that spreads faster so that
you know everything wants to reproduce
faster uh that's why that's the key
component of evolution
so so some thought is just that the uh
the less lethal stuff is what
um it evolves to and the lethal stuff
kills people before they can spread it
so it doesn't evolve as fast
but we have a problem with the the Delta
variant and maybe some other variants
and that they don't ever seem to die out
at least not yet but we do have uh
reports of let's say if you look at the
Dynamics of India versus Israel this
comes from Twitter account covid-19
Crusher
and if you do some some magic on the
numbers it looks like one of them has
lots of vaccinations and is getting a
certain result in their curve and one of
them does not have many vaccinations and
is identical in their curve of you know
decrease in cases so the question is can
you compare these two things a region in
India versus Israel and say oh we've
learned something vaccinations work or
they don't work and I would say no no
every time you see a comparison of two
regions
whether it's state to state or country
to country or you know counties within a
within a region or whatever they're all
useless
too many other variables
and it'll take about a second after one
of those you know graphs appear on the
internet for somebody smart to say ah
that number is wrong you picked the
wrong number from the wrong column or
you know there's some obvious reason
that it's wrong
so a hundred percent of the time when
you see any two countries compared for a
covet just discount it in your mind you
should say nope doesn't mean anything no
matter how clear the data looks and how
obvious the out the interpretation would
be just assume the date is wrong because
it almost always is now maybe not every
time but probably 95 percent of the time
um yeah somebody's saying why aren't
homeless people dying from covet well
let me tell you what I think is going on
virus goes around in a community a lot
of people get a low viral initial dose
maybe so low
that their immunity kicks in before they
even know they have a problem
so I feel as if it's the low doses of
the virus that make the virus
effectively its own vaccination so it
could be a combination of it evolves
it evolves to something less deadly but
more spready because that's how viruses
like to evolve that gives them more more
opportunities to live
but also I think some kind of
self-vaccination is happening I think
that'd be just speculation
all right but it's weird that we don't
know what makes a virus go away
um
there's another study on uh proper mask
use what do you think
new study on actually from June I think
um and it said masks definitely work and
it makes a big difference now you don't
need to know the data do you believe it
so you just heard there's a study
that says masks totally work and they
work pretty well
you know reduces the R by maybe 20 25
which would be a lot
do you believe it
unfortunately no but here's something
I'm going to add to that conversation
um do you remember when all the smart
people said masks don't work because
people fuss with them
right
all the smart people said that right
they said masks aren't going to help you
much because you're touching them and
fussing with them and stuffs on your
hands then your hands are infected and
it's just a big old mess
and then we learned that the virus
doesn't like surfaces
it's pretty much Airborne or you don't
get it right so you don't see people
worrying about touching doorknobs
anymore you know if you go down the
escalator
um I don't I try not to hold the
handrail on the escalator but you could
you could touch all the items in your
office with your bare hands
right so I think all of the worry about
touching your mask
didn't make any difference
so I think
we will come to learn that you could be
touching your mask all day long and it
will have almost nothing to do with
transmission rates because the only
thing that matters is how much of that
virus is getting through the mask and
then the air it probably doesn't matter
at all
if you touch it with your hands because
it doesn't seem to be a surface
spreading problem
so I would warn you that I am not a
doctor
and you should probably
you should probably
scrub down your surfaces and wash your
hands as much as possible that's what
the experts say I have no reason to
believe they're wrong but I'm just going
to add that whoever said that the mask
touching was going to be a big issue
it's probably not an issue at all it's
probably zero
uh China is doomed
for lots of different reasons but here's
one way
so China is talking about how they want
to pursue common prosperity
meaning that they have too many rich
people and too many poor people so
there's a you know one percent of of
China owns a third of the country
one percent
owns a third of the wealth in the
country
turns out that's just about what it is
in America too but China is saying hey
we have to change this uh they're
basically saying we knew we were going
to create a bunch of rich people by
opening up the economy as they have in
past decades
but they thought that phase two would
would be to become more socialist after
they made a lot of money
so China's strategy is to use capitalism
to make a bunch of money and now they
figure they've done that and now they're
going to try to figure out how to claw
back that money from the billionaires so
that the poor people can can benefit
what is it that China is about to do
wrong
what they're about to do wrong is ignore
human motivation
yeah I'm seeing in the comments right
the only reason they have money
is that they didn't do the thing that
they're planning to do next
and I don't know if those two things can
ever be compatible now you know there
there is some reason to imagine you
could tweak it because you know Europe
has highly used socialist countries with
capitalism so
maybe maybe they can just have good
health care and stuff
but I feel like it's going to be a big
big problem and this uh I feel as if
this income inequality which isn't going
to change by the way because the rich
people also control the the
the government in China
just like pretty much everywhere
so the rich people aren't going to get
want to give away their money so they're
just going to stop it from happening
so if any income inequality just keeps
getting worse and the poorest people in
China are having a tough time
could be a revolution
could be
CNN has some uh fake news on marijuana
or at least that's how I interpret it
it's uh suggesting that no matter
whether you smoke and vape it or eat it
cannabis increases your risk of a heart
attack
so they found that people who smoked
marijuana were imbibed it in any way had
a greater chance of having a heart
attack than people who didn't
was that causation
or Coral is a correlate correlation
coralization was it causation or
coralization
 was it causation or correlation
which one was it
well
they even say it was not causation
so they did not determine causation but
CNN reported it like they had
but in their own words they have not
now is there anything that would suggest
to you why people who are more likely to
smoke marijuana might have a worse
Health outcomes
well one reason that people smoke
marijuana is that they're using it
because they have bad Health outcomes in
the first place
so probably marijuana does skew a little
bit toward people with worse health
because it's a medicine
who takes more medicine
people who need medicine people in poor
health
so that would be one correlation I would
look at
but I would imagine that people who are
more likely to smoke marijuana are more
likely to do anything dangerous more
likely to eat you know fast food more
likely to do a lot of things so I
wouldn't put too much credibility in
that study
um
what is up with those old videos we saw
of people collapsing in the street in
China
will we ever know why the why we saw
those remember in the beginning of the
pandemic it looked like people were just
falling over dead and
in Wuhan well those are obviously faked
or doctored or something
because definitely people are not
walking down the street and falling over
debt
but why did they do that
was it to cause their own public to do
anything they told them to do
was it
um a way to round up dissonance
you know just a cover story for rounding
up dissonance
no no I wonder if we'll ever know or was
it something to screw the rest of the
world so the rest of the world would
shut down their economy whereas China
wouldn't
because I don't see that benefiting them
exactly because they have to sell to the
rest of the world
so I don't know maybe we'll never know
but it's weird
all right so here's my provocative
question of the day what would the
pandemic look like if most doctors
has skill at data analysis and
persuasion
because I don't think most doctors are
statisticians
and I don't think most doctors have ever
taken a course in Persuasion
and so we've got the people who are in
charge
who can't read the data
and we know that for sure because they
come to different conclusions if all
that if all doctors came to the same
conclusion
I'd say well they must be pretty good at
reading data but if they come to
different conclusions
which is typical
yeah what do you do with that
so
let me give you an uh
some actual examples of what problems
that causes all right
um
so because doctors are not good at
persuasion and data
we're still talking about Ivermectin and
hydroxychloroquine
if doctors
could read data
no I'm not high but thanks for assuming
if doctors could read data
and they were good at it and they were
persuasive
would we be talking about Ivermectin and
hydroxychloroquine
probably not
probably not right because the doctors
would all look at the data they'd all
come to the same conclusion
they would persuasively tell you what
that conclusion was and you would say to
yourself oh that sounds pretty good
doctors all agree
they've now told us what's going on we
agree
so that problem would have maybe be
better
um remember I told you there was a
doctor Dr Corey who was talking about
there were 31 randomized controlled
trials that say Ivermectin works
well what's the counter to that
can you imagine that there could be
how do you counter
31
randomized controlled trials on
Ivermectin that collectively show it
works really well how can you possibly
argue against that
well Andres back house does
effectively by pointing out that if you
remove the studies that are known to be
low quality for reasons that you know
would be objectively observable
if you if you took out the ones you know
are low quality
it reverses the result
so
what the hell do you do with that
do you take the meta-analysis which says
all right we know a lot of these studies
are low quality but if you look at them
all together
they may be low quality for different
reasons and therefore the the studies
sort of cancel out their flaws and you
can see overall hey every time every
time you look at the overall it looks
like it works
but if the only reason that the
meta-analysis works is that a whole
bunch of the studies were bad
there may just be some big problems with
the data so if you remove the low
quality studies it reverses it now
here's the problem
who gets to decide which studies are low
quality
right right it turns out that this is
like it looks like it's science
but if you can choose the studies you
like and ignore the ones you don't like
is it science or is it just people using
their opinion and rationalizing it with
whatever data they want
all right suppose doctors were good at
persuasion and data analysis there's an
article today by Dr David Nichol in the
mail plus I tweeted it
he refers to what he talks about
Ivermectin he says
he says quote in an article he wrote
well Ivermectin is not in any way
suitable or licensed for is the
treatment of Coronavirus
so he says Ivermectin is not suitable or
licensed
and of course he says any sane person
may see that as obvious
so he's a doctor who says that any sane
person not a doctor are there any sane
people watching
if you are saying
do you buy his comment that that is
obvious uh that the that
because the drug the way the drug works
is it damages the nerves of parasites
but a virus is not a parasite
and it's far too tiny to have nerves
so this doctor says Dr David Nichol
he says anybody could see that
Ivermectin couldn't possibly work
against the virus because the way I've
objected Works doesn't even apply
because the virus doesn't have any
nerves to damage so how could it work
we know it works against parasites
because they have nerves to damage but
how could it possibly work this doctor
says and it's obvious and you know
anybody can see it because it's designed
to work in a different way
than would be even applicable to a virus
how does this doctor explain
yeah there Eric you're ahead of me
how does the doctor explain the
Ivermectin Works in vitro
that it works in a test tube
is killing something
right now the in vitro the test tube
test doesn't tell you it works in humans
because you know there are lots and lots
of cases where the works of the test
tube doesn't work in humans in fact I
think most often
I think it usually doesn't work in
humans if it does work in a test tube is
that true give me a give me a
fact check on that
but
um
uh
yeah
if we know it works in vitro his
argument that we don't have any
mechanism for how it works is a moot
point
so do you trust this doctor who tells
you there's no mechanism for Ivermectin
to work at the same time you know it
does work in the laboratory
he's got to explain that right if he
doesn't at least explain why it works in
vitro
he needs to just stop talking right now
it could be that just everything works
in vitro I feel like you could take a
piss
in a in a coveted
you know a coven petri dish and your
piss would kill the Covenant
I think I mean that's just a random
example Diet Coke
do you think you could put a little Diet
Coke on the virus and it would kill it
probably
probably right so it doesn't really mean
that much that it works in the test tube
however
this doctor says there's no mechanism
for it to work clearly there is clearly
there's a mechanism because it works in
vitro so he at least has to explain that
now he's trying to persuade us
are you persuaded by a doctor
who ignores the fact that Ivermectin
definitely works
in vitro
no because he's leaving out the thing
you know
that you think matters
that's a problem with persuasion you
have to address the things that people
know to be true or you can't convince
them
you have to say what a what what the
person you're trying to convince
if they believe something's true you
have to specifically address it you
can't just ignore it or just you just
look like a liar if you ignore the
argument and try to make a point without
you know addressing the main argument
all right here's what else he says he
refers to Ivermectin as quote horse
medicine
if a doctor an actual medical doctor
refers to Ivermectin which we know is
something that's used for both humans in
some cases and animals in different
cases
if he refers to it in his persuasion as
horse medicine
should you listen to anything else he
says
nope nope because he's talking like the
people that are already convinced
if your doctor is trying to convince you
not to take Ivermectin
and he calls it horse medicine
what's the first thing you think about
that doctor
 idiot
right two words idiot
would you listen to anything else a
doctor said
after calling Ivermectin horse medicine
you would not
everything everything said after the two
words horse medicine should be
discounted because whoever says that is
a idiot because you know it's
both a human drug and a horse drug and
it's a little different right
so this is a real good case of where
doctors are not taught persuasion this
doctor needed to say that Ivermectin is
used for humans this doctor needed to
say there were 31 randomized controlled
trials it shows it works this doctor
needed to say
that it that there was a meta-analysis
that suggests it works he needed to say
all of those things
and then
having said those things he could I will
listen to his argument
of why he thinks Ivermectin isn't the
answer
now he doesn't actually ever give a
reason
so I don't think he had one
but
um
you know and he's even acting as though
he couldn't prescribe something unless
it was approved for that purpose
would you listen to a doctor
a doctor
who told you that they can't prescribe
something
unless it was approved for that purpose
I mean I'm not a doctor and I know you
can do that
right don't all of you know you can do
that
I think everyone out here knows a doctor
can prescribe something as long as the
doctor's judgment you know has a reason
there's a medical Theory to it and it
looks like the risk reward makes sense
of course I can
so
this is the least persuasive doctor I've
ever seen that was probably a smart guy
right how do you become a doctor unless
you're smart right so
so there's no question that doctors are
smart
um
but they don't know persuasion and maybe
they should
uh
the study I told you about masks had two
parts to it I left out one part first of
all don't believe any mask to study
just in general just don't believe
anything
don't believe any vaccine study you
don't believe any Mass study don't
believe any Ivermectin study just don't
believe anything on the internet
because the odds of a big writer small
but I should say that the study this
shows that masks do work
did not
show that mandates work
got that
it showed that from a physical sense
masks according to their research make a
difference and a pretty big difference
but there was no correlation between the
ma the mandates
and a good effect
because apparently people either wear
them or not in the right situation just
sort of naturally
let me say it a different way
even if you did not have a mask mandate
during a pandemic you'd probably wear a
mask to visit your grandmother in the
old folks home right
even without a mandate
so it could be that the Mandate doesn't
add enough because people are already
using their judgment in Risk Management
in a right enough way that they're doing
all the important ones you know they may
they may be doing everything that's
important and maybe slacking on the less
important stuff such as not wearing a
mask Outdoors
uh maybe that's just speculation again
yeah as Billy Mandalay points out a mask
mandate a little bit of sexist
couldn't it be a person date
yeah it could be it could be a people
date
all right I've got to go do some other
stuff as long as I've covered all my
topics and I have and I would say today
was
um once again
an amazing amazing live stream better
than usual
gets better every time and I will talk
to you tomorrow
