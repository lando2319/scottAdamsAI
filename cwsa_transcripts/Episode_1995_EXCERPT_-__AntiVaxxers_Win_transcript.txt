here's what's going to happen
I'm going to tell you that the people
who the anti-vaxxers appear to be right
anybody who did not get vaccinated
got a little Omicron
or maybe even a worse one but recovered
now you've got natural immunity
and you have no vaccination in you
can we all agree that that was the
winning path
the smartest happiest people are the
ones who didn't get the vaccination and
are still alive
I want to make sure
that I'm not leaving any wiggle room for
myself have I
have I said as clearly as possible
they're the happy ones right now
and have a reason to be completely
right having uh having said as clearly
as possible that the anti-vaxx people
seem to be the winners
I want you to hear that clearly the
anti-vax people appear to be the winners
the anti-vaxxers clearly are the winners
at this point and I think it'll probably
stay that way
and and I don't want to put any shade on
that whatsoever
they came out the best they they have
the winning position
the unvaccinated have a current
advantage
because they they feel better the the
thing they're not worrying about is what
I have to worry about
which is I wonder if that vaccination
five years from now
because really the anti-vaxxers I think
were really just distrustful of big
companies in big government
that's never wrong
is never wrong to distrust government
it's never wrong to distrust big
companies
right so if you just took the position
let's just distrust everything the
government did well you won
you won
you won completely
I did not end up in the right place
agree
you would all agree with that right I
did not end up in the right place
the right place would be natural
immunity no no vaccination
you should take victory and I should
take defeat we can agree on that right
that that my position is now the weakest
and and your position has gone from the
weakest to the strongest
and that we can just say that's true
the people who did give acts are
absolutely in the winning position
do you win
you win
you are the winners
you are the winners
all right let me say that part with no
ambiguity you won you won
all all of my fancy analytics got me to
a bad place
all of your heuristics don't trust these
guys it's obvious
totally worked
