whole world falls apart
well i better put on my microphone
that'll make a difference
remember i told you that one of my
secrets for success
is simplicity and while many of you have
been saying
scott can you improve the quality of
your live stream
and i've always said the same thing yes
i can improve it
at the risk of it up every time
like this as soon as as soon as i added
a second stream
with a second audio setup and a few more
buttons
i guaranteed that 25 of my live streams
would be a technical failure
just with just one little extra element
of complexity which is
remembering to put on two microphones
instead of one
probably a 25 failure rate if you do it
yourself i suppose if i hired an
engineer
i could do better all right
but the important thing is what's new
and have you done the simultaneous set
lately if you haven't
well my god what you've missed if you
have you heard of it it's called the
simultaneous sip it's better than
at least two of the three major
vaccinations
for preventing covid
a lot of people don't know that but the
simultaneous sip uh yes it's part
bar science and it will make you
feel better and all you need is a copper
mugger glass a tanker jealous steiner
canteen juggler flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it work now
go
do you know how addiction is created
this is one of those uh facts about life
that once you hear it and understand it
for the first time some of you already
know this
but when you hear it for the first time
it just blows your mind
it's one of those things that will
inform everything you do from that point
on and here's that fact
addiction happens when your rewards are
inconsistent if you get the same reward
for the same action you just get used to
it
it doesn't become an addiction so easily
but if sometimes you
you peck on a lever and it gives you a
little pellet
and sometimes it doesn't you'll be
pecking like crazy like sometimes this
works
and you become addicted it's a little
bit counter-intuitive
so once you understand that giving
people inconsistent rewards
works better than consistent rewards if
you want to addict them
you will know um
kevin is thanking me for giving a shout
out to meek comics
on the locals platform now
you should go check it out uh locals is
a subscription platform anyway
i think i was going to talk about the
news today
so the new york city board of elections
had a little issue they were trying to
elect a new mayor
at least the first phase of that and
one of the candidates i think was eric
adams noticed
that there seemed to be more than a
hundred thousand votes
that seemed to sort of appeared out of
nowhere
and once he noticed i don't know if
other people noticed but the
reporting is that he noticed the
candidate
and when he pointed it out sometime
later they looked into it and found out
that 135
000 pre-election votes in other words
votes that were not for this election
they were a pre-election were being
counted because they were
not properly purged from the system
um what
what are you telling me that the only
reason
over a hundred and thirty five thousand
votes
were not mistakenly counting is the only
reason
because one of the candidates noticed
there was something wrong
was that the only reason they counted
him again because what if he hadn't
noticed
let me ask you this the the election is
pretty close
i would imagine that say 25 000 votes
would be enough to change a result
it feels about in that range right let's
just we're talking just hypothetically
here
what if the difference had been 25 000
votes
and nobody noticed what if nobody
noticed
how easily could nobody have noticed 25
000 votes
it would have completely changed the
election now as
some smart pundits noted this is going
to have
a bad effect on people's
trust in the election system
to say the least to say the least
the difference is sixteen thousand
somebody's telling me
um you talk were you talking about the
national election the sixteen thousand
uh or the the local election i'm not
sure what your reference was
um but how chilling is this
now here's my point if the problem
you're looking for
is in physical ballots i figure you
could probably
find that with an audit
um and thanks
dennis dimenis
anyway i you can you can actually fill
in the rest about this story
because everything that you thought
about the national election
it just brings it all back and you're
like wait a minute
are you telling me that we were this
close
to having a completely you know
incorrect
election and it's only because somebody
caught it
that's that's the only reason that it
didn't didn't go the other way how easy
would it
have been not to catch that and then my
other question is
how many other things potentially could
have gone wrong
on the digital side of things that you
wouldn't catch
right what if a digital system and i'm
not alleging that anything like this
happened
because as you know no court in the land
has proven that there is a widespread
election fraud
so therefore it didn't happen that's
called democrat
logic let me try that again no court
has ruled that there was widespread
election fraud
therefore logically and according to
science
it didn't happen now a lot of you are
saying to yourself
wait a minute that's not logical that's
not logical at all
don't give me your old stale classic
logic
the new logic is if you didn't look for
it and therefore you didn't find it
it doesn't exist it's democrat logic
it's 2021 logic and you've got to catch
up
if you're if you're lost in the past
with your old classic logic
where things have to like connect and
make sense and
you know be sensible to other people who
are observing well we don't live in that
world anymore so
let it go just let it go
well as i tweeted provocatively um it is
not my job to convince you to get
vaccinated or not vaccinated
because i'm not a doctor so that's
between you and your doctor
and your conscience and all those things
so can we first agree
i'm not trying to persuade you to get
vaccinated or not
that's not the point of what i say next
but
when you like as much knowledge as
possible
wouldn't you like to have all the
information that you possibly could
to make your own decision i think you
would for those of you who have not
decided yet and so i'm just going to add
a little bit of information
and this might not apply to you this is
a personal experience
my personal experience uh now being
fully vaccinated with the moderna
vaccination
which we've learned is also protective
against the
delta variant the one that we worry
about the most
so i've got protections against the
variant
i've got apparently permanent protection
they say we won't need a
booster if you have the moderna or the
pfizer i think so i won't need a booster
permanent protection against that and
all the variants
personally i haven't experienced any
side effects
that i could identify doesn't mean i'll
never have one
right i suppose there's some non-zero
chance
that somewhere down the line i have a
complication
so you have to make your own decisions
about the risk
but the only thing i want to add to it
is that i feel great
that's it psychologically
i feel great when i go outside
fully vaccinated it's not that i was so
much worried about catching it
it's just this not on my mind anymore i
can go anywhere like i walk like a god
in you know in a in a minor way uh when
i go into a store and i see
unvaccinated young people with their
masks on
i just think you poor bastard
you poor bastard i i just walk in like a
god i'm all vaccinated
not worried about anything laws don't
apply to me
it's great now here's the counterpoint
as soon as i tweeted this somebody else
tweeted a very different
experience so somebody else got
vaccinated and their psychological
experience
of being vaccinated is that they were
bullied by
a a government basically
how would you like to feel that you have
been bullied by a government
into getting a shot a medical procedure
for god's sakes a medical procedure that
you maybe didn't want on your own
how would that feel pretty bad right
pretty bad if you felt like you you were
forced to have a medical procedure that
you didn't think was good
um
abe i'm reading your comment i'll see if
i can work that in later
so take that uh take that as you will
people who have my kind of let's say
maybe i'm an optimist
and maybe i'm not as worried about the
government
clamping down on my rights as some of
you are i'm not saying that's right or
wrong
but different personalities have
different priorities
and i would say if you're closer to my
personality where you're sort of an
optimist
about things you might feel the way i
feel
which is great i mean really
psychologically it's a big big deal
just walking outside and feeling
vaccinated it's great
but be warned if you're closer to that
other personality
where your your bigger concern is that
the government is bullying you into a
medical procedure
which they are that that's literally
true
the government is literally bullying you
into a medical procedure
if that's if that's the thing that's
going to bother you the most well
just incorporate that in your decision
so i'm not going to try to convince you
one way or another as i say i'll just
i'll just say add that to your fact pile
i saw a long tweeted twitter thread
yesterday in which someone was
questioning whether i really meant it
when i talk all the time about not
having goals
for everything but rather having systems
that get you to a good place that may be
different than whatever specific goal
you had
and it was a long thread proving or at
least making the case
that clearly i don't mean that that what
i really mean is you always have a goal
it's just that you also need a system
no let me be as clear as possible
i do not mean that you need to have a
goal
sometimes yeah if you let's say if you
join a bowling tournament
is your goal that your team will win the
tournament of course
of course so there are plenty of cases
that are just straightforward
where there's a goal and why wouldn't
you try to get it
if you're an author and you write a book
is it your goal to have a successful
best-selling book
of course of course because you've
entered a game where there's one way to
win that's it
once you're in the game of course you
want you have a goal
but i'm talking about all the system all
the times
when you want to generally prepare
yourself for a good thing
but you don't know what the good thing
will be that's where
the system works let me give you
specific examples
when i started cartooning it was not my
goal
to be a syndicated cartoonist
it was my goal well let me stop that
language
it was my system to get up every morning
and practice drawing
that was it that was the end of the
system
now of course there was the assumption
that a
bird on my security camera a damn bird
of course it was my intention that if i
could get good at drawing and making
cartoons
that i could sell them somewhere but i
didn't have a specific
you know objective of where to sell them
etc i just thought
i'll be as good as i can i'll get as
good as i can and then i will
sell them wherever i can now where that
led me
eventually was to become a syndicated
cartoonist
and here i am let me give you another
example when i started blogging
i was not blogging to make money because
it didn't make any money
i mean really a little bit of ad revenue
or something but basically no money
but i blogged almost every day that was
a system
i was becoming good at something by just
doing it a lot
in public so that's the system be good
at something in public
and it will attract offers sure enough
because of that blogging i got book
deals and that blogging was not about
cartooning per se
and it allowed me to shift my entire
career focus
into more of the life advice that had a
failed almost everything book
the win bigly book and then loser think
more about how to live your life etc
a complete career transformation
that i did not plan i simply had a
system
blogging every day and doing it in
public so people could see me work
and then attracting offers that's what
happened
when i started live streaming some of
you
know the story the very first live
stream was just me thinking
hey this there's this new feature on
twitter that's
now defunct called periscope and i just
held up my phone and it was you know
during the first election period for
trump
and i just turned it on because i wanted
to learn about a new thing
that's it i just wanted to learn about a
new thing
because it looked like it was going to
be a growing more important
industry the live streaming and i said
to myself i would like to
learn about it you know get a little wet
find out about it and just add it to my
talent stack
i was not trying to do this
it turns out that this has been
amazingly successful
in terms of influence and the type of
people who watch it
by the way if i told you who watched
this paris this live stream
you wouldn't you wouldn't friggin
believe it but you know i hear it
from people individually so people will
privately tell me that that they watch
it on a regular basis
but it's some really influential people
i know you're watching right now
influential people
so none of that was planned but of
course you always have a
general sense that if things went well
wouldn't you like it to get bigger
i mean but is that a goal you know
everything
is better if you get more of it and it's
a good thing so that's
that's basically uh that's basically a
goal
do more so i would like to push back on
the idea that
the systems versus goals thing is really
just a word trick and it really
you really do have goals no i'm
i am completely serious about having a
system without a goal
for example i have a diet system to keep
my diet on track
and i have a fitness system to keep my
fitness on track
what is my goal i don't have one
right i don't have a weight goal i don't
have a
you know size of muscle goal i don't
have a goal
just sort of generally would be better i
guess
healthier maybe you're more
aesthetically
pleasing if my body you know has better
muscles or whatever
but no goal right just health
all right i'm old enough to remember
this i don't know if you are but do you
remember when science was respected
it was a while ago if you're old enough
to remember this i think it was uh
was it last year 2020 back when
we still thought the science was a
pretty good deal and very credible
and if scientists told us something was
true well it's probably true
probably true this morning i read a
tweet
that said masks don't work any better
than
underwear can stop a fart
and i saw that and i said to myself you
know
i remember a time when science was more
respected
than far analogies
maybe last year but
in 2021 it is literally true
that science is not respected more than
fart analogies
because the number of people who read
the tweet about the far analogy
probably believed that at about the same
rate
as we believe anything science tells us
in 2021
just think about the fact that it is
literally
as credible a tweet
about farting through your underpants
i'm not even
exaggerating the tweet about farting
through your underpants
is as credible not as true
but as believed by the public
as science
none of that's none of that is hyperbole
it really isn't
and if you think it's hyperbole you're
missing the point is
actually that's how bad it is that we
don't trust
we don't trust science more than a fart
analogy that's where we are
so congratulations
um here's a really provocative story
so a federal judge in manhattan
tossed out a an indictment
against a bronx shooting suspect
because why do you why do you think this
judge federal judge
tossed down an indictment again about a
shooting
suspect well it turns out that the grand
jury pool
wasn't diverse enough that's right
an indictment has been overturned
because the judge ruled that the jury
wasn't diverse enough okay
now you see a problem here
that if you look look ahead a little bit
like what what's the
logical uh place that this goes to
i'm not saying it's a slippery slope i'm
just saying that this opened a pretty
big can of worms
let's say you had been convicted of a
crime
in the past see where i'm going
let's say you've been convicted of a
crime
now you've got a little precedent going
for you right now i'm not sure if this
quite qualifies as precedent
because it's not i guess i'd have to be
more of a
lawyer to know if the word precedent
could be applied to
a judge throwing out an indictment i'm
not sure that qualifies can somebody
here tell me
but at least at the very least
it's giving cover for somebody someday
to say
my conviction needs to be overturned
because the jury did not
represent the community i was in
how often do you think that happens that
the jury does not match the racial
structure
of the situation the person was in
a lot because how much off would it have
to be
suppose it was forty percent off
from the racial composition of your
community is that a jury of your peers
how close to a peer group do you need to
have
for to be a legitimate jury of your
peers because now there's a federal
judge who says
if you haven't hit a certain standard
that i guess is subjective
about diversity that your
indictment will be thrown out it works
both ways
if you got convicted and your jury did
not look it quite exactly like
the the situation in your town can't you
appeal
don't you have a case you see the
problem
the moment you throw anything out
because of the racial composition of the
jury
alone without regard to the facts of the
matter
just the racial composition as soon as
you allow that that's a thing
it's got to be a thing everywhere you
can't just pick your spot
that's either important or it's not
important
and the legal system needs to decide
this is a big problem
i don't know if this judge quite
realized what kind of implications this
might have
and i also don't know if this counts as
precedent so if there's somebody here
who
actually has some legal knowledge that
would be
very helpful and i don't know if
precedent always means
the same thing you know maybe there's
weak precedent and
strong precedent all right well i'll
wait to see if there's an answer to that
in the comments all right um
how about this lindsey graham talking
about iran
played the uh the hitler card and here's
what he says he said
on tv the other day or yesterday the
iranians are playing president biden
like a fiddle
the ayatollah is a religious nazi
hitler wanted to master race the
ayatollah wants to
once a master religion and that he says
they're trying to drive us out of syria
in iraq so they can dominate
blah blah blah the shia crescent and
they're trying to build a nuclear weapon
to hold the world hostage and one day
destroy the state of israel
now here's the thing
you either have to totally rebuke
lindsey graham
for saying that iran is like a hitler
situation
so you either have to rebuke it
or you have to get a lot tougher with
iran
don't you and who can rebuke it
like who can make the case that that
analogy is
just way outside the the realm
you know i'm of course like many of you
i'm a big critic
of hitler analogies because rarely does
a hitler analogy work
right it's usually just such a gross
exaggeration that
it's just crazy but in this particular
case
is a hitler analogy too far off
well i don't know that the iranians have
a history of executing people for their
religion
or um ethnicity
so i don't know if that quite fits
because
are there not uh they're not many of
them but i believe there are jews living
in iran
who haven't been executed or imprisoned
must be pretty uncomfortable but
at least it exists so what do you think
what do you think of the analogy
um they do want to force people to be
their religion
that seems true except they have
enforced
the is the jewish people who live in
iran they haven't forced them to convert
so i think the bigger crime is if you
uh if you're ever a muslim and you try
to
get out of it then you're in big trouble
but they don't seem to be forcing
people into it at least not directly
maybe indirectly there's enough bullying
that's going to happen
well here's the point you either have to
rebuke lindsey graham and say that's too
far
or you gotta treat it like it's an
actual hitler
problem and we would have to be a lot
tougher on them
so i think you know we're gonna see
biden become
trump on iran you know one way or
another he's
to have to get tougher i think that's
just built into the system it's going to
happen
well president trump had a good time
knocking cnn for their
failed ratings their ratings of course
have collapsed
exactly because trump is not in the news
now the cnn people have tried to put on
a good face and say
as don lemon did oh i'm actually happy
that my new my ratings have collapsed
because it means that
there's no trump in the world to get us
all worked up and do bad
things and so don lemon says he would
much rather
be a failed uh person on tv
and have his career turned to dust than
to have a president trump
who was ruining the country according to
him
i'm not sure i find that totally sincere
but i'd like to point out a few things
about
this story
so apparently jake tapper became part of
the story because he tweeted back at the
president
and reportedly jake tapper has lost 75
percent of his audience since january
and here's what jake tapper said to
about the president mocking their
ratings
he said quote if i had incited and
inspired a deadly insurrection
and attempt to undo american democracy i
might not be out there bragging about
how many viewers ahead
on any channel but maybe that's just me
i'm a different breed of cat
tapper wrote well here's the thing
um even even fox news and their coverage
of this
they referred to jake tapper so
so this is just listen to the source
this is fox news
on their website they say that jake
tapper is widely considered the most
professional journalist on cnn
so jake's the most professional
journalist
um on cnn so
is that true because i've often said
that everyone on cnn
is a version of jake tapper have you
ever heard me say that
if you look at fox news every
personality is pretty distinct
there's not really a second hannity
right
you know there's nobody like gutfeld
tucker
completely his own person laura and
graham you know
all of them are just unique
personalities but on cnn
it looks like everybody's a version of
jake tapper
you've got you know gay jake tapper
black jake tapper female jake tapper but
they're all
they're all like a jake tapper ish
but apparently uh at least fox news is
saying that jake tapper is
the most professional journalist
journalist on cnn
well jake tapper just mentioned a deadly
insurrection that never happened
so president trump accused cnn of you
know
or just mocked them for their low
ratings and the most
professional journalists on cnn
responded with fake news
literally fake news and insurrection
now as i've said before everybody is a
version of jake tapper what would
jeffrey tubin be
what what version of jake tabber tapper
would
jeffrey tubin be well i call him
jake fapper jake vapper
i'll just let that sit with you for a
moment
jake fapper you're welcome yes that was
my best joke of the day
cnn averaged 654 thousand views
during the second quarter uh
six hundred and fifty fifty four
thousand viewers
that's the size of my twitter feed
so every tweet i send out
has at least the potential you know the
algorithm decides who sees it
but every tweet i send out has the same
potential audience size
as cnn
so is cnn important anymore
now of course the their television
viewing audience
is probably trivial compared to their
online presence and their website
so really we shouldn't count their tv
viewage we should count their
you know their website stuff as well to
be fair
all right i'm loving watching that story
between the fight between fox news
and them let's talk about gwen berry
so gwen berry is the hammer thrower was
in the olympics and she didn't want to
face the
flag or acknowledge the the national
anthem
but she's defending herself now and she
said quote i never said that i hated the
country
i never said that all i said was i
respect my people enough
my people i guess that would be black
americans i'm guessing that's
the context that i respect my people
enough to not stand for
and or acknowledge something that
disrespects them
i love my people point blank period
so i'm not sure that
anybody explained to gwen berry what
she's doing at the olympics
i don't think the olympics are designed
for the athletes are they
when the olympics were designed did
people say
let's let's do this giant worldwide
thing for this tiny group of athletes
because that's what it's for we really
want to spend billions of dollars and
make you know a global event
so that we can benefit a few elite
athletes
who can throw a hammer really far for
example and can ski and shoot
anybody was the olympics you know were
the olympics designed
for the athletes i feel like no
the olympics were designed for world
cohesion
you know for the benefit of the audience
for the benefit of the countries
involved and their status
but it wasn't for the athletes of course
we want the athletes to be treated well
because we're good people but they're
really not the point of the olympics
if you want to do something for the
athlete maybe join
a professional team but if you want to
do something for your country
well maybe the olympics would be a good
way to do that
so i'm not sure gwen understands that
the olympics are
not about gwen but more importantly
did she not understand that when she
stood on that podium
and the uh the national anthem of
america was played
does she miss the point that that
national anthem was
respecting her it was her accomplishment
as an american that was being respected
by that song
it's not a question of even really
her respecting the song that song was
playing
respecting her and what she did for the
country
etc so i don't think she understands
what the song is for
doesn't understand what the olympics are
for and chose the most useless skill you
could ever develop
which is throwing a hammer this is a
woman who doesn't understand
anything about anything i can't imagine
a worse
representative of the country so well i
certainly
uh would would accept whatever her
freedom of speech
is and i don't condemn her for i don't
condemn her at all
for expressing her freedom of speech
anywhere she wants to
but i don't think she understands what
she's in it's like it's not
it's not like she understands her
situation and then made a different
decision than you and i would
it's like she didn't even understand
what the situation was
so when i look at what she did i can't
even understand it as a strategy
that's good for her that's good for
black americans
do you know what would be the best thing
for black americans
to see a black champion standing on a
podium
while the well the national anthem is
played
to effectively honor the athlete
i can't think of anything that would be
better for black americans than seeing
black americans
succeed against all odds and everything
else
looks looks like that would be a good
thing all right let's talk about trump's
legal problems
um it doesn't matter at least in
in terms of the 2024 election it won't
matter if trump
is personally convicted of anything
because 25 percent of the
public will believe he did those crimes
because they hear about them so much
if cnn and msnbc just keep reporting
about all the things that trump may or
may not have a legal problem with
25 percent of the public will believe it
happened
even if none of it really ever happens
just all the talk about it
so in terms of the news they get
everything they want
politically by talking about it forever
whether it ever turns into anything
how many people still believe that there
was russian collusion
by the trump administration probably 25
of the country right you can get 25
of the country to believe anything and
that would be enough to keep trump out
of office i would think
if uh if you ran again
so here are the some of the things that
are being reported on cnn
one is that there's reports or rumors
that there were large
cash payments to employees of the trump
organization that
were not properly accounted for tax wise
have you seen that evidence it's just
something appearing on cnn
do you believe that there were large
cash payments
made by an actual organization
and that they didn't account for the the
tax
effects i don't know that i even believe
that
i would need to see a lot more evidence
that that happened
it's one thing to say that there were
perks that weren't handled right
which is actually fairly you know normal
kind of a thing that happens with
corporations
but to say that there were large cash
payments just to avoid taxes
i'm going to need to see some evidence
of that
so this is the perfect kind of thing to
just like put it out there
until the public believes it's true and
then i'll bet we'll never see a charge
on that
so my prediction is you will never see
an indictment or a charge
based on large cash payments i'm going
to call on that one
all right so that's my that's my
prediction for you we'll see if that
turns out
now usually the uh the problem of not
paying enough taxes on employee benefits
would be a civil case and not a not a
criminal case
but maybe this is all to squeeze you
know this the
cfo into giving up something on trump i
suppose
um now i also have this question about
what would be the point
of the trump organization giving
benefits
tax-free work with me on this and i need
an
accountant or maybe a tax professional
to help me
if if you're the trump organization or
any organization
and you want to compensate your
employees more
by giving them some kind of a benefit
let's say it's a car
or paying the rent on you know their
work apartment or something like that
as a company you want to include all of
that on your taxes
because it will reduce your taxes
if you were to give an employee a
benefit sort of
off the book somehow you don't get the
tax benefit
now you could argue the trump
corporation wasn't paying a lot of taxes
because they had so many legal
write-offs that they
it wouldn't matter if they included that
expense or not
but i don't think so i think it does
matter doesn't it
so i need a tax opinion on this is there
any way that the
trump organization itself would be
better off
by not recording an expense
because that's something you do for the
benefit of the employee that's not for
the benefit of the corporation
and why would they do that why would
they do that
they would want all of their costs to be
recorded because that's how they reduce
their taxes
if they're being accused of trying to
cheat on taxes
why would they do it that way now you do
have a tax
differential let's say that the
individual would be taxed at the maximum
because an individual doesn't have
as many tax write-offs so maybe
you know maybe it made sense because
let's say the trump organization wasn't
going to pay any taxes for a long time
because of write-offs
but maybe the employee would have so if
you kept it off the books
do you come out ahead i need a little
bit more
clarity on on what the charge even is
because i don't see a way that the trump
organization comes out ahead
and it's the organization that's being
accused not individuals
right so the trump organization
the entity is being accused of doing
something that's good for somebody else
an employee and bad for the entity
itself
what the hell kind of crime is that or
is there something i'm missing
is am i making some major analytical
assumption that's not true i don't know
what i'm missing here
so at the very least we need some
clarity
the other things that uh are being
rumored is that there's uh something
about
uh the trump organization put different
values
on some of their properties for the
purposes of taxes
than they did for the purpose of getting
loans or paying property taxes or
something
now why would that take so long to
investigate
let me ask you this the the simple
question of whether their assets have
been inflated for one purpose and
minimized for another
that's just documents right you don't
think that the
prosecutors have seen all the documents
they need to see
you don't think that they had time to
send out maybe an
independent uh evaluator to say no this
building is worth more or less
how and how in the how in any
possibility
does it take this long to know if
somebody inflated an asset
now i suppose if they wanted to find
every asset for every year
and really dig into every single thing
that could have been inflated
maybe maybe but by now we would have a
specific
example i would think this building
was you know this problem
there were other little problems but boy
this building they really
inflated this cost on this building i'm
feeling that every day that goes by
that we don't see a conclusion to this
inflated property value thing
i don't think it's real so here's my
prediction
there will be no indictment
on uh asset inflation or
valuing so that's that's my prediction
there won't be an indictment on that
now if i'm wrong about the indictment
i'm going to back that up and say there
won't be a conviction
but but i'll go a little bit more
aggressive and say there won't even be
an indictment
um because it just it just doesn't feel
real enough
at this point then there's also the
question of the quote
hush money paid to silence allegations
of an affair
my understanding is that that would just
be a fine right
if if you didn't account for uh
something that
arguably did have a valid
i did darshan would say this that as
long as you have a valid
campaign reason for doing something it's
it's fine
but maybe there was a tax implication of
it but this is just such small ball
nobody's going to jail for the stormy
daniels stuff
at most i guess it's a fine that's it
because apparently a lot of people have
violated campaign
finance stuff i think obama did it was
just a fine
so the the way this is reported is so
fraudulent
all right the tucker carlson story gets
more interesting
uh the nsa he blamed the nsa for
spying on him because he says there's a
whistleblower that says exactly that
and that his digital communications had
been penetrated by the nsa
with and that there was an intention to
take his air his program off the air
now as cnn cleverly points out
and i don't know if you knew this it
turns out that nobody else on fox news
is reporting this story hmm
now cnn uh i
i criticize you often but
you do have a good point on this one
apparently the rest of c
of uh fox news is not buying into the
story
because otherwise it would be the top
story right so
the news part of fox news is not biomass
think about that on one hand
it's really a good sign because one of
the things i always compliment
fox news on is this much clearer
distinction
between what's news and what's opinion
perfect example the news people have
made one decision
uh an opinion person at least one of
them tucker has a
very different view and they put them
both on
apparently both opinions are on there
one one by its absence and one by its
inclusion that's actually a really good
sign
for an organization that has opinion and
news
that sometimes they don't even agree
that's not terrible now it would be
terrible
if the news people know it's not true
but i don't think they can know that i
think they can maybe just say we need a
little bit more before we report on this
but you'd think that they would at least
report that their opinion person is
talking about it
it's at the very least it's news that
tucker carlson is making this claim
that's news so at least that should be
on the news
so we don't know what's happening with
fox news but uh
there might be some disagreement on that
now here's the funny part
um the nsa made a statement and they
said the following
and this is how liars deny things all
right
so i'm going to teach you how to spot a
lie
this is a lie what i'm going to read you
now
is a clear and unambiguous lie
and it's very obvious in the form that
they put it
the way you find the lie is that it's
overly specific
so here the nsa is going to deny a
couple of things
that are not actually the allegation
listen for it
they say quote tucker carlson has never
been an intelligence target of the
agency
it's pretty specific isn't it to say
that he's never been a target
is that the same as saying we're not
looking at his communications
no the allegation is that they're
looking at his communications
what they denied was that he's an
intelligence target
and we know from experience that that
doesn't mean he's not being
monitored it just means that that label
target
is not applied to him but rather could
be applied to somebody in his universe
which gives them
access to his communication so when you
see this specific
the specifics of this denial what they
could have said
is we are absolutely not monitoring his
communications in any way
right they could have said that if they
had said we are not monitoring his
communications whatsoever for any reason
that would be in denial but
he's not an intelligence target
is confirming they're doing it and
that's really a confirmation that
they're doing it
then he goes on it says the nsa has
never had any plans to take his program
off the air which was the other
accusation
now did tucker carlson say that the nsa
as an organization has a
formal plan to take him off the air well
he wasn't too specific
but that would be a pretty dumb
assumption
because the the reasonable assumption is
that employees who work for the
organization have
let's say democratic leaning tendencies
and that the individual employees
and maybe some other bad actors working
with them are doing this thing
did tucker ever say i think it's a
formal plan of the nsa
the organization's leadership to take me
off the air
he did not he did not he talked about
you know the purpose of the the snooping
was to take him off the air
he didn't say it was an official nsa
plot plan
so when the nsa says very specifically
that they never had any plans that's
probably true
i'll bet you if you could get access to
all their documents
there would be no leadership of the nsa
saying it is our plan to take tucker
carlson off the air
then they went on to say the nsa went on
to say that it has a foreign
intelligence mission
and that it quote may not target u.s
citizens without a court order that
explicitly authorizes the targeting
again a little too specific
right because nobody accused them
of uh of changing their mission
they accused them of sort of you know
violating the mission and yes
and clapper has already lied on this
very topic in a different context
so what do you do with the fact that the
nsa has effectively just confirmed that
they're spying on tucker carlson
and yet fox news isn't going to cover it
what the is going on here seriously
what the is going on i don't know
what to believe about this story
but i do know that the nsa didn't deny
it and they confirmed it
so let me say it as clearly as possible
this is a confirmation this
is a confirmation it's not slightly
suggestive that they did it
it's a confirmation you can't confirm
anything harder than this
if they had said yes we did it
it would not be a stronger confirmation
than this
this very specific denial that's a
liar's denial
let me give you an another example let's
say you accuse your spouse
of messaging a lover
and your spouse says i don't have a
burner phone
and you say no i didn't accuse you of
having a burner phone
i accuse you of messaging a lover
and then your spouse says i do not have
a burner phone
stop saying i have a burner phone and
you say wait a minute wait a minute
nothing like that just came out of my
mouth i'm saying you're messaging using
any variety of messaging app
on any device i'm not really being
specific i
think you're messaging a lover i'm not
using a burner phone that's a
confirmation
right it's a confirmation there's no
other way to interpret it
somebody says been there scott a lot of
bad memories
sorry i didn't mean to trigger you
all right uh i guess tucker carlson also
called general milly a stupid pig
uh for his wokeness comments etc
max boot got on the air a
democrat operative and he says what
would republicans have said
if aoc or the squad had called the
general
of the united states military a stupid
pick
what would republicans say then huh what
would they say
um i think they would cheer
this is the worst argument i've ever
seen max boot
if the squad had said exactly what
tucker said about this general
which is that he's using wokeness
uh for probably political reasons and
weakening the military with his wokeness
if the
squad had called him a uh
stupid pig for chasing wokeness instead
of keeping the country safe
do you think republicans would have said
hey no you're going too far
no republicans would have said well
finally we agree
thank you yes he's being a stupid pig
they wouldn't use those words i
agree that that's that's not so much
you know the way the republicans
typically talk
and i'm not sure i would call a tucker a
republican
but i'll say leans in that direction
i don't know what he is technically
let's talk about north korea apparently
kim jong-un has fired some people who
are in charge of his covid stuff
because they're not getting it done and
north korea is in big trouble
they got 25 million people and basically
no vaccinations
now let me suggest the following here's
another
situation in which trump would have been
a better president
clearly and let me lay this out for you
and you'll see it
i i think it's guaranteed that the
united states will reach a point where
we have more vaccinations
more supply than people willing to get
vaccinated and we're
probably about there meaning that the us
will be in a position
to create you know or generate lots of
vaccinations for other countries and
help them out
now how should we do it because there
are lots of countries that are going to
need lots of vaccinations and we can't
do everybody
but just imagine imagine a president
trump
saying 25 million people in north korea
we're going to vaccinate them all
just think about it 25 million people in
north korea
and as long as kim jong-un says yes
we're going to vaccinate them all and
it might come at the expense of some
other countries that could use some
vaccinations quite desperately
you know some african countries some
other countries that are in desperate
straits
but why would it make sense
strategically
to vaccinate all north koreans
because it would end any threat we ever
have with them
forever for the price of 25 million
vaccinations
it would take china's influence over
them to a lower level
and it would guarantee that the united
states
doesn't want to be in a war in fact we'd
like you to be healthy
we don't want north korea to crumble
having nuclear weapons
we could basically guarantee that north
korea is never a threat to the united
states again
just by doing them a solid that we're
not doing for other people
and just play favorites just say look
when
when it comes down to an emergency
call on us call on us we'll take care of
it
so i think a president trump could make
that happen
i don't think a president biden can make
that happen
and this would have been a permanent
change this would just be a forever
memory
north korea would never forget if we did
this for them
now of course this requires kim jong-un
to be you know
fully on with the plan and willing to
get closer to the united states in
return for this
but man this is a giant opportunity i
mean it would be crazy not to take it
this is free money don't i always tell
you that trump always takes the free
money that people leave on the table
this is freaking free money because
we're going to give vaccinations to
somebody
and we're probably going to give them to
countries that don't have a strategic
value to us at all so why not do it
right
so north korea if you're listening and i
suspect you might be
we'd like to help you out at least some
of the citizens would
here's a irony i didn't see coming
that uh apparently climate change is
gonna and the
the agreements to lower uh carbon
are gonna destroy china before the
united states
didn't see that coming apparently china
has a massive
energy problem right now it's not the
future like right now
they don't have enough energy to even
produce what their economy
can produce they're actually rationing
energy and the problem is
that they can't use their messy coal
plants as much anymore
and they can't build new ones because
they're committed to
getting to being what carbon neutral by
2060
so even though their goal is you know
pretty far down the line
there's no way to get there unless they
get really really tight on energy right
away
at least they think which means that
their economy is now constricted
by their own energy policy
the energy policy that trump said was a
chinese hoax meaning that it was a plan
to get us to
weaken our economy in a way that they
wouldn't have to
now that's true in the sense that they
don't have to act as aggressively as we
do
but i'll bet we're not going to be
running out of energy as fast as they
are
so it looks to me that this uh the hoax
if you will
and that's a hyperbolic talking i don't
think it's literally a hoax
but it could be a strategy a strategy
that china wanted to the u.s
economy by having us be too
to climate change focused while they are
not
but it turns out that their problem is
so much bigger than ours
because their growth in the number of
people etc their problem is so much
bigger
that even if they act far less
aggressively it's going to kill them
because we could be a lot more
aggressive we're a little more flexible
a little more
just some advantages we have here
technologically and otherwise i suppose
so didn't see that coming
it looks like greta tunberg is going to
take out china
that's right greta will destroy china
their economy is in trouble because of
this
all right um so
i'm almost sure that those are all the
things i wanted to talk about today
it was a fascinating news day and i
think the highlight was
jake fapper all right yeah i think i got
it all
um just a word on the live streaming on
the
locals platform it turns out i need to
upgrade something on my laptop because
it wasn't streaming right but i think
it's on my end
because it wasn't affecting anybody else
so
i'll get that fixed and then we'll go
back to beta testing the live stream
on locals one reason you might want to
watch it there
is that if you're a subscriber there
won't be any
uh commercials um and by the way if you
subscribe
to youtube you don't get any commercials
too so you'd have your choice
all right um
that's all for now and i will talk to
you
tomorrow
