well
uh ladies and gentlemen
and
anything else you would like to label
yourself which is fine with me
you have made it to what i call
the highlight of civilization
the best thing that's ever happened to
you and
for many of you
some of this will even
extend into your families and the people
you talk to today yeah that's how good
it is not only will you be delighted in
the next 40 minutes or so
but think about the people you will
touch
the people you meet along the way
yes and i hope they enjoy the
simultaneous simultaneous sip just as
much as you're about to and all you need
is like copper mug or glass a tanker
tell us diamond canteen sugar flask a
vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
you know i kind of like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine here of the day the thing that
makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
go
story number one
can somebody remind me how to pronounce
c e n k
first name of
or
helped me pronounce the last name too
is that chenk
jenk right jenk
uh jenk uh uyghur
iger
how the hell do you say his name
that that's such a disadvantage if you
have a name that the
you know the great
majority of your potential audience has
trouble pronouncing
uh so jen kuwiger all right so you all
know he is if if you're watching this
you probably know of him
and uh
he was uh he tweeted today he goes the
new trend among conservatives
like uh matt gates and representative
mtg and joe rogan and bill maher
wait what
hold on
the new trend among conservatives
like matt gates
representative
marjorie
taylor green
joe rogan and bill maher
that's a list of conservatives
well he goes on
uh it's their trend is to make fun of
overweight people while feigning concern
about their health
they're blaming kovades on them and
mocking them as the real problem in
america classy as always
now
i guess we could talk about the content
of it which is
whether or not they were
mocking people of weight problems
i didn't see it but i understand they
were mocking body positivity
which would be
different than
mocking people who have weight problems
it would be people's opinions about
their weight problems
because we we mock people's opinions
that's still fair right
can we still mock opinions
i think that's still fair right so
um i'm not sure that they care he
characterized what happened there but i
didn't see it so i'll i'll uh i'll be
neutral on the point of the
thing but
have you noticed the following trend
have you noticed the following trend
that when somebody is willing to
consider arguments sometimes on the left
and sometimes on the right or at least
to look to the other side to see what
they're thinking and and make a decision
about
on a topic by topic basis
which ones which one makes sense
why do you call people like that
well
they seem to get called conservatives
and rhinos right
am i right
so if somebody considers things on both
sides
sometimes you say conservative
and other times you might say they're a
rhino because you know they looked at
some stuff on the other side
but in both cases they're being called
people on the right
at what point do the people on the left
notice the pattern
yeah and as somebody is pointing out
here the same happens to me if you if
you see a
an article about me
i'm called sometimes far-right
or conservative
which is pretty far from what i am
i labeled myself left of bernie except
better at math so i don't have crazy
ideas like he does
um
so at what point does the left notice
that whenever anybody can consider
arguments on both sides
they're never called liberals
let me say it again
whenever you see somebody who will
consider an argument on both sides
they're never called liberals
when is it when are they going to see
the pattern
am i right that that should become
alarming at some point
wait a minute
the ability to consider an argument that
i don't hold well that's not a liberal
that must be some kind of crazy
conservative or
or if you're a republican it's a rhino
okay
um
here's a little uh
so a tweet from uh doc anarchy
who you should follow uh his twitter is
uh at uh dr anarchist one word
and he notes today uh and i've noted
something similar but i like his framing
he says human brains are not ready for
virtual reality gaming and pornography
now how big a deal is that
is that like a
a witty little observation about a small
little corner of gaming
has no impact on you or me or anything
important
or
or
is it the end of civilization as we know
it
i think it's closer to that second thing
now when i say end of civilization oh it
could be an improvement but it's going
to change
if you think anything's going to be the
same
after virtually reality
nails pornography and that's really
really close
if you think anything will be the same
after that
you've never tried a virtual reality
headset you just have to try one
and see how
how let's say
how engaging it is even is in its
current terrible form
if you were to rate how good is a
virtual reality
right today
compared to
how good it will be say in 10 years
almost for sure i'd say it's about a
2 and a 10 today
and
there's nothing that's going to stop it
because even as a two and a ten
it's so compelling
even when you can see the you know you
can see the seams and stuff and you know
it's fake
still
is so compelling
that when that thing gets to like an 8
out of 10
nobody is going to want to spend time in
the real world
it will not be competitive
imagine putting your headset on sitting
in your chair
you know you've got a limited budget
but all you have to do is put on the
glasses and you go anywhere
what's that going to do to you
and what happens when there's a 3d
printer that can make
smells
that feels like something that could
happen right don't you think somebody
will have a 3d printer
that can like
print a little ocean smell
you know so it goes along with the the
virtual reality imagine if your sense of
smell
started syncing up with the the vision
do you know how strong those two things
are
you know the the audio part is easy
you they can already do audio that'll
sound like it's the real thing
but once you've got visual and smell
somebody says smells won't be a thing
but i i think whenever you bet against
something like that you're wrong
it's just how long it takes
now i don't know it would i don't know
that it would be a 3d printer per se it
could be a little tabletop chemistry set
that just drops a drop of something into
something else i don't know
could be something like that
but
you don't know how this is going to
change things now when i say this could
end reproduction
i'm not joking about that
does anybody think i'm joking when i say
that virtual reality when it gets to a
certain point of quality
will make human reproduction look gross
it well
it'll just sort of look gross to do it
with a like a real person because the
real person is just going to be somebody
who sat and
sat in a chair
with vr goggles eating potato chips same
as you for the last six months
when you take the glasses off
from your perfect world
are you going to want to go get some of
that
how about i hook up with the the other
the other person who hasn't exercised in
six months because exercise is no fun
compared to sitting in a chair and
eating potato chips
humans having sex is almost
it's almost obsolete
where you're only a couple of tweaks of
technology away from complete
obsolescence because your brain doesn't
know how to make that adjustment
and that's that's the point of doc
anarchy's tweet
you don't realize that your brain can't
handle this what's coming
there is no way your brain can handle
this and there's no way it's going to
stop
because somebody's going to make a ton
of money
anything addictive that's also legal
is
just a money faucet
right
if it's legal and completely addictive
like
twitter
it's going to make a lot of money for
somebody
so of course
this will actually just
grab technology or grab civilization by
the neck and i was thinking that in the
short run the only thing that's going to
keep countries viable
is tons of immigration
from places that don't have good
technology yet
you're going to have to bring in humans
from countries where they don't have
virtual reality in any mass way because
otherwise
nobody will do anything
do you think you're going to be able to
get somebody to
say do some handyman work on your house
if they could watch virtual reality and
collect a
universal basic income
you know the virtual reality could
replace all of your entertainment needs
and then all you need is a universal
basic income
and a roof
and a toilet basically you're good to go
so i don't i don't see this like driving
productivity in a good way
um on the plus side our biggest problem
up to now has been drug addiction and i
do think that
mushrooms are going to be
medicinally used you know used in a
correct way i think that's actually
going to change
addiction
which up until now is our biggest
problem in my opinion
we don't talk about it as much
so there's a story
that in israel
the chinese embassy gave their i guess
their counterparts or something in
israel the israeli government some
thermal mugs
some mugs to keep your coffee warm
and when they were taken apart they had
some
mysterious let's say technology in them
that didn't belong there so they're
thinking it's either tracking or
or a bug to which i say
how is it in the news already and yet
they haven't figured out if it's a
tracking device or a listening device
like did somebody go to the news a
little bit early
like as soon as they peeled the cover
off it and they saw there was something
electronic in there did somebody run out
of the room and call
call the press and say we found a thing
it's an unidentified thing we don't know
if it's a bug or a tracking device but
put this in the news
or do you think
it's more likely that if that happened
somebody would have torn it apart and
they would have said let's have our tech
guys look at this because they're sexist
so they say guys right because unlike us
they're not very woke but they say guys
i'm sure because they're like that
so and then their their tech people
if we could be more inclusive would look
at it and they'd say hey this is either
a bug or a tracking device but how how
hard would it be to figure that out
wouldn't you know if something had a
microphone
wouldn't you
i mean if you were if you were in that
kind of technology
i think you could find out if it
transmits
couldn't you tell if it had a gps on it
or something i don't know
so
and somebody's saying it's just part of
the heating device uh they didn't say if
it's the kind that heats when you put it
on a warmer
or if it's oh that would have been
clever wouldn't it
imagine if it didn't activate until you
put it on the warmer and the warmer is
plugged in
that'd be kind of cool
but
here's my warning to you don't accept
any
chinese
thermal mugs and also a true story i
bought some
i can't say it out loud because of my
digital assistant that's listening
but my amazom
plugs
oh i can say that word amazon that's the
other word i can't say a-l-e-x-a
so i bought some plugs for lamps
and i think because of the supply chain
or something
or because i'm bad at shopping i didn't
see the normal
ones that amazon does that has their
name on it so i bought some that i
thought were lookalikes
but they required their own app
which already
sort of made me angry because i don't
want to add an app to do anything so i
add an app
and the app is um clearly labeled as a
chinese product
now the the the physical plug
had some american looking name that you
know you couldn't tell where it was made
but as soon as i opened the app the app
was you know clearly labeled
something made in china
now do you think that i put these
devices
with the app clearly labeled made in
china into my wi-fi system
nope
 and them
like i i didn't even want to return them
because somebody else might get them
i just threw them right in the trash
and waited to get the real ones now were
the real ones made in china i don't know
i don't know but i have to think there's
slightly more
chance
that amazon the company
checks their product that has their name
on it
to make sure it doesn't have anything
suspicious in there
but i'm not so sure
that amazon the company would check
somebody else's branded product to make
sure there isn't something suspicious
inside of it
right it's something they might do with
maybe their own hardware i hope
so i'm not sure i'm protected
by using the amazon brand
versus the one that is just compatible
but i was creeped out
i mean that's pretty creepy to put any
kind of chinese hardware and software in
your wi-fi
would you do it
if yeah and i'm not even sure we have a
choice because there's probably always
some chinese-made product that's in the
mix somewhere
but would you do it
all right most of you say no
yeah
all right
well here's another example of trump was
right some of you saw this video
apparently there was a video back in
2018
that showed german officials uh
sort of rolling their eyes and laughing
at uh trump
when he predicted that germany would
become dependent on russian oil or what
i'm sorry russian energy
and he said that germany is totally
controlled by and quote captive to
russia
and people just laughed oh they rolled
their eyes
you silly old orange menace you
and then they captioned it this so it
was a lefty organization had this video
and their caption for back in 2018 was
trump made some outrageous claims about
german energy at the u.n and the german
delegation's reaction was priceless it
was priceless
boy did they make him look dumb
it was priceless those smart old germans
so
i remind you of
again one of the predictions of which i
am most proud
that the longer trump was out of office
the better he would look
because you you couldn't see the good
things he was doing because because of
all the the noise around him it was just
invisible
and then if you actually could
you know wipe the fog away and just see
the sort of the substance you'd actually
be kind of surprised
you'd be kind of surprised how good he
was at a variety of things which is not
to say
he's good at everything
just like everybody right
so i'm not saying everything he does
turns to gold blah blah blah blah you
have your own examples of stuff you
don't like but to deny that he has
special talent
is i think just denying the obvious he
does have
special talent
and i would say that the place that you
should trust him the most
is
you know if he's talking about human
nature
negotiating
because this is sort of in that domain
business
and
how some can get over on you
wouldn't you believe him
who are you going to ask
right i mean this could not be more
perfectly in his domain
like
reading putin's intentions
i don't think anybody could be better at
reading putin's intentions
because don't you think that they they
both have a little bit in common in
terms of let's say thinking about their
role in the world and
yeah they probably have something in
common
where where trump can say you know
if i were a brutal dictator
this is what i'd be doing
and if you were a brutal dictator you
know what trump would have been doing
apparently
trump would have used his energy control
over germany to give some leverage
that's what trump would have done
had he been
a brutal dictator of
um
uh sorry i just so somebody's reading my
book god's debris
uh that book has had a lot of impact
over the 20 or so some years so one
people mentioned to me the most
it's called god's debris you can even
get us a free copy if you want if you
google it
uh there's a free i think somebody's got
a
pdf of it
which i allowed actually so if you see
one that looks illegal like an illegal
electronic copy of it it's not illegal
that book is allowed to be
passed around in digital form
all right
so i digress trump looks better than
usual
um
okay the you know the big story is the
big shooting at the subway in new york
city
are you all okay
with me not really talking about any
mass shootings
is everybody okay with that because i
like to talk about the headlines
but
number one these get talked to death
number two we only say the same things
right the the only thing that's
interesting about this and it's only
barely is that the fox news cnn framing
if you go to fox news
it's a racist shooting because the
alleged probable person of interest
maybe perpetrator who knows alleged
uh is black
and he had some rants that made him look
racist
so fox news is saying it's a racist
thing and cnn is saying it's a violence
thing
and a gun thing
so there of course is being framed
differently but that's
i don't know you always expect that
right
so that's all i'm going to say about
that
um are any of you following the
the scott ritter being suspended for
things he said about ukraine and russia
and
i
i always get in trouble in this topic
but it doesn't stop me from doing it
so let me start by saying i don't think
people should be banned from social
media
for being wrong
does everybody agree we're all on the
same page right
you shouldn't be banned for being wrong
because then everybody would get banned
eventually
so there's no way you could have that as
a standard
but
does it matter what you're wrong about
right so let's say you're wrong about
something that is health related and if
other people believed your wrongness
they would die
should that be bad
well
i mean that's that's where the question
gets tough
in general i'd say no
because there should be a better way to
deal with it which is to put the
counterpoint closer to the the ban or
potentially ban material so it's
probably just a better way to handle it
but
so i'm not on the page of banning speech
but the next thing i i say about it is
going to make you think maybe i am all
right but i'm not
there's just something that's important
that needs to be said and i'm the only
one dumb enough to try to like slice
this fine enough to say this
right
and that is that
it's really hard to get kicked off of
social media
unless you're trying you almost like
you're trying and people think it's
because of what you say
and i don't think it is exactly
i think it's more about the way you say
it
i think it's about the way you say it i
don't believe people are getting kicked
off
exactly for content
for example
if you said
i believe a bad thing is happening would
you ever be kicked off
i think i don't have evidence but i
think a bad thing is happening
i don't know has anybody been kicked off
for saying they have a like a hunch or a
belief
i don't know can you give me an example
now suppose you said i know something's
happening and
it's verifiably untrue
and that it would be dangerous
so people are getting kicked off of that
i think that the scott ritter example
depending on your point of view and what
you believe is true or not true
could fall into the category of things
that
[Music]
you wouldn't get kicked off for saying
if you said it right
so i tested it by trying to say it right
and if i get kicked off before we're
done we'll we'll know
so the the issue that ritter got
suspended for i believe are two tweets
in which uh in both he alluded to
ukraine being sort of a false flag
uh committer of the murders and buca
now the news is reporting that they're
probable or almost certainly
russian atrocities
so that's the narrative the official
narrative is it's russian atrocities
but scott ritter is
claiming um
not as an allegation let's say not as a
speculation
but he's treating it like it's a fact
that it's a that it's a false flag and
that the ukrainians actually were guilty
of
murder mass murder
now
the tweets that allegedly caused the
problem and i think there's good
evidence they're the ones um
he doesn't show his work
but there's indication that he's talked
about it in in more depth
but if you tweet it without showing your
work
and it's against the narrative
and it could have an impact i mean
it's a life and death
it is life and death how the mainstream
media in the united states sees ukraine
would you give me that
it's a life and death question because
if our popular opinion about ukraine and
the united states shifts
so too would our support in one
direction or another it is life and
death
so given that it's life and death
very high stakes
if scott ritter said something that was
against the mainstream
could get people killed could
potentially
should he be banned for saying that
something that could get people killed
but the tweet itself doesn't show any
support for it
and
and the people doing the
doing the banning or censoring
would believe it's definitely
false
it's a really tough one
but i would go with not banning them
anybody agree disagree so i would say
don't ban him even though it's life and
death and even though it's going to kill
people maybe i i can't even say it will
it just might because the problem is as
soon as you say it might kill somebody
where do you end up
totalitarian government you know i'm not
a big believer in the slippery slope but
there's no slope there at all
if somebody can say
you're
you said something that'll get somebody
killed
and and that gets banned
as soon as you say that then there's an
argument for banning everything
well that would degrade the uh the
reputation of the country and in the
long run if you've degraded the
reputation of the country somebody could
get killed
right it's it's the universal reason to
ban everything somebody will get hurt
yeah so you can't really do that but it
looks like that was done
so i want to say as clearly as possible
i don't know anything that would support
his opinion
and i doubt he's right
just an opinion so here's what i tweeted
to see if i get banned because i think
i'm saying it right
so i tweeted that in my opinion
so i said in my opinion so nobody's
looking for a source
in my opinion ukraine has committed war
crimes
and my reasoning is that i also put in
the tweet so i showed my work
my reasoning is that in a war of this
scale
there are always war crimes on both
sides
do you think i'll be censored
so i i just called our team you know the
ukrainians it feels like they're our
team right the united states is backing
the ukrainians so i just said our team
almost certainly is committing war
crimes and i said it on social media
and it's basically the same thing scott
ritter said
but he used a specific example
without pointing to his work around that
specific example
so i think i said it correctly
and i don't think i'll be banned
and
could i get somebody killed
yeah yeah
is did i just tweet something that
literally could get somebody killed
you could argue it
because if you imagine that that point
of view became
let's say more persuasive so more people
adopted it because i said it
i don't think that's going to happen but
suppose it did
well you can make an argument that i had
talked
sort of a trash against ukraine caused
ukraine to get less support and cause
some kind of a genocide
using the provocative word because we
hadn't supported them enough because i'd
said that there were criminals too so
people said ah
you know why why would we support any
war criminals so you can make an
argument for everything
everything kills somebody
yeah you just can't you just can't use
that standard
so um but i will also acknowledge that
any private company such as twitter
is in a tough spot
because they do have to they have to
satisfy their stockholders they have to
satisfy their employees or else they're
not a business
and they're not the government
so you could actually you could
completely understand
how twitter would take a different
approach because they're they're
satisfying different gods right
either god is not
free speech
everybody likes free speech but their
god is the stockholders
and you can't satisfy the stockholders
unless you can retain your employees
and you can't retain your employees
unless you
do some stuff that maybe you weren't
inclined to do otherwise
so
this is why elon musk is so important to
the system
because the system was at a stalemate
you know the government could only do
what the government does
private companies have to do what they
have to do to make money and attract
audience and keep shareholders and all
that
and they were kind of trapped
so we didn't have free speech
and we didn't have a solution
and then elon musk comes along and he
just grabs the whole damn box and just
shakes it
and then you look at it again you say
okay is is elon musk on the board of
directors did that fix anything no that
doesn't look like that would be enough
in fact in fact it might limit his
ability shake the box
okay elon musk says he's not going to be
on the board of directors
maybe we should consider some ideas that
nobody's ever taken seriously before
but why would we i mean why would we
suddenly take these ideas seriously when
we never before oh elon must just tweet
it shake the box shake the box shake the
box now what do you have
sooner or later
you know and who have i said this about
before trump right trump is a box shaker
if you can't make a deal with the
variables you have you have to add
variables
or change variables just shake the box
and you see you see elon musk doing that
with twitter
like it's a pair of pants like he's just
like grabbing the laundry and shaking it
all right how does that look
nope shake shake a little more
got anything yet anything yep any
variables like nope shake shake shake
and watch watching him do this right in
front of the world
the the box shaking until until the
engineer can see the parts
his memory is an engine he's sorry i
don't think he's technically an engineer
but he's an engineer at least by mindset
and
i think he's just waiting for the
variables to
to lock in and he'll be able to see the
field once he shakes it off
there's more shaking coming
um
so here's the thing
if everybody does everything right
according to who they're serving
sometimes the system doesn't work
and you just need somebody who's bigger
than the system and there are only a few
of them
right trump is just bigger than any
system
elon musk is bigger than any system so
you need somebody outside the system and
bigger than it to shake the box
i feel like i just said the same thing
too many times here
and i was challenged by uh
gregory mickles on twitter twitter user
i interact with a lot
and
i was saying that uh
the one of the reasons i can get away
with things like the fine people hoax
because it was pointed out that i've
tweeted about the fine people hoax
without always showing my work i don't
always link to the sources
and that that was an example of uh
me saying something that was against the
mainstream narrative but i didn't can't
get canceled so why should scott ritter
be cancelled so it must be about the
content right that would be the argument
but i would say you can't really make
that out that's not exactly a good
analogy
because all it takes to prove that to
find people hoax as a hoax is to
look at it
just look at the video
that's it
and you could google it and you see you
know tons of proof that's
incontrovertible in my opinion
uh
so i think me
mentioning something that's against the
the narrative but has so much evidence
for it it's just so obvious
the worst thing that anybody could do if
they wanted if they wanted people to
believe the fine people hoax was real
the worst thing they could do is censor
me for saying it's a hoax
because i already have too much
visibility like it would be a story
that's right so the press would cover it
if i got banned from twitter
from saying that the fine people hoax
was hoaxed it would be in the press
and then you'd have to look at it
then you'd be forced to ask the question
well why why is this stupid cartoonist
guy
dying on this hill it's like a dumb
place to die on
so banning me would make my mis my
message bigger
you get that
if you banned me for that in particular
would make my message bigger and more
effective
if you ban scott ritter
how many of you had ever heard of scott
ritter before twitter
did he even know who he was
i mean some of you had
but if he gets banned he just sort of
disappears so banning him actually
changes you know
it supports the narrative
banning me would work against the
narrative
so it's not comparable
all right
uh here's biden making things worse uh
now he's decided that
putin has uh committed genocide so i
guess using the word genocide
just triggers things into a higher level
of you know
legal and
and moral
badness
but french president macron
he didn't want to comment about that
because he didn't want to say that
ukraine is committing genocide because
he said quote
i would be careful with such terms today
because these two people russians and
ukrainians are brothers to which i say
what does a genocide mean that
did they change the name of genocide to
something because doesn't it have to be
somebody different from you that you're
killing
to make it genocide or is that not in
the demon definition
should we should we just check the
definition right now because i think
macron's right right
that if you're just killing people who
look just like you
that's more like just mass murder or
evil
or war
fratricide
yeah but it's not genocide is it or i
guess it's just a definition
right
so
um
i don't know is biden even being
advised on this stuff or is he just
throwing out a word
when he wants to get things going
now i have to admit
let's do the uh
let's do the what if the other team did
it
test all right remember you should do
this not just on things that you don't
like
somebody accusing you of but you should
do it do it on your own opinions now
then like this
if trump had said
that
russia was involved in genocide at this
point in the
in the situation
would i have said that was a bad idea
probably not
probably not because if trump said i'd
say oh he's just ratcheting up
the the public relations badness against
putin because then no matter what
happens russia will be
in trouble as long as putin's in charge
because he'll be you know under this
genocide label so if trump had said it i
would just say it's good just good
persuasion
and so i'm going to give biden the same
break
everybody okay with that
so i don't i don't know for sure if
biden has thought it out i think if it
had come from trump he probably would
have
because his history is such that this is
exactly what he does think out
but i don't know if biden thought it out
but i'm going to have to give him the
benefit of a doubt
i'm going to give him the benefit of it
because it could be that his advisor
said you know here's the next escalation
you know we need to keep escalating as
he escalates
it could be that it was just meant to be
provocative in which case i'd say that's
okay
puts
ups the pressure
well finland and sweden
um who have been non-aligned until now
looks like they're probably going to
join nato maybe finland first
how many of you have ever looked at a
map
of nato expansion
over the last i think is 20 years or so
because if you look at the map you could
have so easily predicted that russia was
going to go to war over ukraine
now maybe it just looks it looks easy in
retrospect
because i'd never really paid attention
had you
how much do you ever pay attention to
what countries are turning nato or not
i've never paid attention you know did
you know that estonia was in nato
okay they are
i didn't know that i mean they could
have been not aligned or
who knew
some of you did and i congratulate you
for being well informed but here's what
you need to know i'm going to describe
it visually
if you could just imagine there's a blob
on the left that's europe
and there's a blob on the right
this will be opposite if you're looking
at my hands on the video uh there's a
blob on the right there's russia
and then in between there are all these
states that you know are all these
countries that were part of the old
soviet union especially
maybe not all of them but if you looked
at it you could see that the blob on the
left grew substantially
by absorbing into nato
a whole bunch of things
and they were getting closer and closer
to the other big blob
and the biggest
remaining sort of
uncontested area between the big blob on
the left that was marching
pretty pretty strongly marching
toward the other blob and when i say
marching i mean bringing into nato
alliance more countries
it was obvious on the map that that was
going to be a war
in retrospect right
you know had i been looking at exactly
the same information before the war i'd
probably say well they're not going to
go to war over ukraine because i'd be
crazy
but after the fact when you know what
actually happened and you look at it on
the map
which i just did today
i looked at it and i thought
um
that's super obvious that's going to be
war
which is what experts were saying right
weren't uh weren't there people saying
uh oh this looks like a war is coming
for a long time
i suppose there are people who looked at
maps
because when you look at it
it's really kind of glaring that that's
going to be a problem
yeah even putin said it right i guess
putin's been saying it for a while
peter zan said it so smart people saw it
all along but you know i've told you
that
visual persuasion
is the second strongest kind
after fear
you know and if if the fear is visual
that's that's the best of all but if you
looked at the map the the persuasion
filter on it would have said oh we got
trouble here
and sure enough
um
so isn't this about the time in this uh
ukraine russia war that there would be
an unverified chemical attack attributed
possibly to russia
yeah isn't it about time for that to
happen
you i was expecting i was like she has
spent a long time
between unverified
chemical attacks
let me let me check the news to see if
anything's happened in the last several
minutes
oh okay there's a there's an unverified
chemical attack
uh being possibly attributed to russia
right on time
right on time
so let's put a little bit of skeptical
thinking on that shall we a little bit
of skeptical thinking
yeah yes it already happened the
the uh alleged chemical attack that has
not been verified
even the ukrainian president zlinski
said he cannot stay with certainty
if chemical weapons were used in
mariopol
now
i was looking at the news about mariopol
and one of the headlines is that
a unit from outside mary pole fought
itself i guess
into
let's say into
what would you call it
they're in physical now proximity to the
the units that were already there
defending mario paul from the russian
attack
would be good news right
yeah if you're if you're pro-ukraine you
say yay the the unit that was already
defending mary pole
now got reinforcements and it wasn't
easy i guess it wasn't easy to get them
in but now they're there
and then you read the details
and the the people who were there were
the azov brigade
now the azov brigade has a little bit of
a reputation problem
if i may say a little bit of a
reputation problem
uh it's
a nazi thing
now
given that we never know what is true
and what is not i'll just say that the
as a brigade is considered the
you know the
at least has nazis or they are nazis or
they like nazis or something right
there's something
there's a nazi sheen on them
now i don't know
what is true and what is not true
and i'm not sure anybody does but
probably some of them are pro nazis
probably i mean just don't know how many
and how much that matters
um but that's a bad look
so you can see why the news downplayed
that part it's like oh they're joining
up with the as a brigade and then people
read that like oh that's good
and i'm not sure
because
here's the warning
the warning is
are you sure there's a good guy in this
war
because we've you really have to decide
there's a good guy and a bad guy right
putin bad zelinski good
i don't know
i don't know
i i'm not sure it's ever that clean
um i'm not sure that the united states
is a good guy in this war either because
it feels to me we could approve we could
have prevented this
it doesn't feel like we wanted to that
badly
does it
if you were to look at just the events
and not look at what anybody said
and not not read anybody's minds you
just look at the events
if the only thing you knew were the
events
would you have concluded that the united
states wanted
war or didn't want war
because it sure looks like we wanted it
if you just look at the events what we
did
now who would want war that would be
crazy
but
i feel as if
there may have been somebody who is
smart enough to say you know if we drag
russia into a conventional war
it's going to really degrade russia
forever
now somebody says now scott is
contradicting himself in all caps
so look all caps
guy uh if you'd like to look like
you're a 12 year old troll
that would be a way to do it
so it could be
that there's something we don't know
about this whole work up to this war
that is would not make you happy about
the united states i feel
because it just feels like it would have
been so easy to say hey
if you don't want nato there
how about we come up with some kind of
non-alignment
you know unlined neutral thing
and we didn't even talk about it yeah
the hill we decided to die on was
that the country itself gets to decide
if it's in nato
that's the hill we decided to die on
except that we didn't die
ukraine did
so we did we decided that ukraine would
die on the hill that we gave them
it wasn't even a hill until we gave it
to him
we basically created the hill
and then told them to die on it hey we
got this nato thing
do not let anybody tell you you can't
join oh no if somebody else tells you
you can't join nato well then you're not
really a sovereign country are you don't
you want to be a sovereign country wuss
hey wuss
you bunch of wusses don't you want to be
sovereign or are you just going to be a
putin puppet what are you going to be
so you better make a stand and say that
even though it's almost impossible that
you're ever going to join nato
you should destroy your entire country
just to preserve the point that you're a
sovereign country you are not going to
be pushed around
by this big bully putin so i think you
should take a stand
it feels like what happened
right now obviously we don't know what
really happened but
uh
there's there's something that really
sketchy that happened over there and i
don't know what it is so we're left to
speculate
that ladies and gentlemen
is just about all we have and i think i
nailed it once again
one of the best
things you've ever seen in your life and
uh
probably it'll take you through the day
with a little dopamine hit would anybody
like any uh oxytocin
a little hit before we go
now you know oxytocin is
the chemical that makes you feel good
and connected to things and
you know really get a connection with
people
and
that one
you usually get from hugging
or intimate things
being in love
but i'm pretty sure
i can jack up your oxytocin directly
do you believe me
have you ever wondered why the placebo
effect works
even when you know it exists
you can even know there is such a thing
as a placebo effect it still works
so i'm going to make you think about a
hug
and think about hugging the person you'd
most want to hug
it could be me but i doubt it
but feel free
if there's anybody out there who just
thinks
that me hugging them would be terrific
then
think of that but if you'd like to hug
somebody far more
more attractive or or that you like
better think of that
now if you're all thinking about hugging
people
do you think i didn't make 20 of you
have more oxytocin
it actually is that simple
it's literally that simple all you have
to do is put your head space in the
place that produces oxytocin
and
i haven't studied it scientifically
but i'd be willing to make a very large
bet
that if you think about hugging your pet
hugging somebody you love who's still
around and available to hug
i'll bet you
that for at least 20 percent of you your
oxytocin just went up because that's how
many i could get with placebo alone
but because i'm a trained hypnotist
and because you've voluntarily decided
that you'd like some oxytocin probably
right
now persuasion works best
when somebody wants to be persuaded of
the thing it doesn't work so well when
they don't want it
so you can't make somebody do something
they don't want to do
but who doesn't want to feel good
who doesn't want to feel connected who
doesn't want to feel a sense of
well-being all day long nobody
every one of you
voluntarily would like to be influenced
by me right now you would like to know
that i could tell you that your oxytocin
level is going to get a little hit and
so i am
it's also true
because when you think about that great
hug
we think about those hugs where
where you just melt into each other
where you almost lose the sense that
you're two people think about that one
think about that feeling you get that
you that just doesn't come from anything
else it's not sex
it's not love
it's your whole body feels good
whatever that is
and you can start to feel a little bit
now can't you some of you are getting a
little bit of tingle aren't you
if you're getting a little bit of tingle
like a little bit of a goose bump
just say so in the comments so you'll
see how powerful this is so if you don't
think that
suggesting
that the best hug in the world
is in your mind right now
and that you can feel it
your entire body can feel it not just
your arms or the parts you imagine
touching but you can feel it on the back
of your legs
you can feel the back of your neck
you feel in your hair
yeah
that
ladies and gentlemen
is your oxytocin
and i'm doing that for you directly
and with your permission
and
a little bit of dopamine to help
so it's going to be a nice little combo
a little bit of dopamine
a little bit of oxytocin
and
one more thing
we're going to top it off
with a sip of your favorite beverage
are you ready
go
now you didn't have to do it
simultaneously it's still going to work
you're just associating this good
feeling
this good sensation
with the good thought
and you get all that in there at the
same time
and we all feel it at once
and suddenly
your oxytocin is higher now let me ask
you this
if i
funded a study
and
actually tested people's oxytocin levels
before and after the simultaneous sip
and livestream do you think they'd be
different
i'll bet they would
i haven't done that study of course but
i'll bet they would and on that note i'm
going to sign off
and
let me know tomorrow
how good your day was today
