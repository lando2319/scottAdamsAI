well good morning
good morning everybody
it's time
to get your attitude adjusted
because you know
sometimes the news is not so good but
luckily i'm here to cheer you up about
all those things
a little dose of better attitude get
that day going
if i lecture you about vaccines
you're going to go
don't worry
there will be no lecturing you about
vaccines indeed
indeed
i'll be arguing that you don't have a
cons you do have a constitutional right
to avoid them
so you're going to like that part but
wait for it
all right before we get going it's time
for this simultaneous sip the best thing
that's ever happened in the history of
the universe and all you need is a
copper mugger glass a tanker chelsea
steiner canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the dope
being here the day the thing makes oh
man everything better just everything
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's gonna happen now watch it go
well i don't know if you know this but
there have been randomized controlled
trials
and is proven that people who
participate in the simultaneous sip have
a better day
than the people who didn't
even the people who
took horse dewormer instead no it didn't
help them but coffee did coffee did
well alyssa milano you know her
uh famous actress and supporter of joe
biden
well i'm going to give her the gutsiest
tweet of the year of the century award
and she tweeted this yesterday
and i'm not making this up
this really happened
so alyssa milano tweeted yesterday i'm
proud of potus
and the incredible job he's doing he's
the right person for the job in this
moment in history
i stand with biden
now
i got questions
i got
questions
is alyssa milano the only person in the
universe
who hasn't noticed
that there's kind of a big mistake joe
biden made recently and maybe he's still
making we don't know um
she's she's proud of him
she's proud of the job he's done
and says he's the right person for this
for the job in this moment in history
and
this raises an interesting question
what would it look like
if the worst person for the job had been
in it
what would the
worst person
for the job do
i don't know
the worst person
probably uh i don't know give names of
uh
people that are trying to escape from
the taliban to the taliban
maybe that'd be bad um i think the worst
person would do that
maybe
maybe when the taliban offered
america
all of taliban to control until the
until the evacuations were over maybe
the worst person in the world would say
we don't need all of kabul
all we need is a little airport we'll
just we'll just we just need the airport
that's sort of something that the worst
person in the world
might have said
anybody else would have said yeah you
know a better perimeter would be smarter
we'll we'll control kabul until we're
done
that's what the taliban offered them
[Laughter]
they turned it down
what
um
so thank goodness we don't have the
worst person for the job
um here's uh news that i consider
fake news until somebody proves it's not
um
and
and by the way the the giving the names
to the taliban these were special cases
it involved like
a bus here or there but it's still a
real problem it wasn't all the names of
all the people but still pretty bad
uh although to be fair they don't have
many options right now
so the fake news is that uh chase bank
closed general flynn's account there
because they didn't want to associate
with his reputational risk
do you believe that's true
now i saw this on social media but i did
not see it in news
that doesn't seem true
i would say
this is a little bit too
too on the nose
right
i'm saying richard
says it's true i'm saying other people
saying it's true
um here's
here's what i would look for i would
only think this is true if it came from
general flynn's twitter account
if general flynn tweeted this
well it's true
if if he's the only person who didn't
tweet it or let's say he didn't tweet it
at all or just didn't mention it
it's not true
somebody says it's his own telegram
our twitter abandon
let's say let's say it comes from his
account though some other account
all right
so i would say that i'm going to call
this fake news unless i heard it from
from him
from flynn if somebody has something on
social media that came from flynn
that you actually did a screenshot
yourself not a screenshot you saw
but you saw you took yourself
on social media of flynn
confirming it then i'll believe it so
just
his brother tweet i don't trust his
brother
i wouldn't trust his brother
i would trust only flynn any other
source doesn't count
but by the way
richard thomas more proof scott's a
right-wing shell
you know i'm going to put you in timeout
because
i gotta hide you dick
literally his name is dick
um
so dick
you're in timeout now
um
so what else we got here i love the
daily cnn anecdotal persuasion
so as you know cnn is trying to give you
one story per day
of somebody who wishes they got the
vaccine
they sure wish they got vaccinated
and they're gonna be one a day forever
until you all get vaccinated i guess
so this one was a woman hospitalized
with covid
comes home to find her husband has died
from it
so she was in the hospital and didn't
know that her husband was literally home
watching the pets and he died of it
while she was in the hospital
now there's no direct mention of whether
they were vaccinated
but they weren't vaccinated
yeah i don't think so
um so this this is sort of a story
you're going to hear a lot of now i'm
not saying you should be persuaded by
this in fact
i'm saying the opposite
you should not be persuaded by anecdotes
individual stories of something that
happened to a person
if that's what's persuading you you're
doing it wrong
but the truth is it is persuasive
we do get persuaded by these little
stories
here's another one
florida radio host mark bernier 65
who disturbingly called himself mr
anti-vaxx
so there's a conservative
florida and florida makes it makes the
story even more interesting right
florida radio host conservative called
himself mr anti-vaxx
can you finish the rest of the story
without even knowing what it is
so there was an old
old guy 65
called himself mr anti-vaxx and he was
quite proud of it
how do you think the story ends
that's right he died
didn't get vaccinated and he died of
coven
now
you knew that was going to be the end of
the story right because the because it's
anecdotal persuasion
if and if the story has that little
twist
oh he he was anti-vaxx and
and he he died
yes you're right anne-marie 65 is not
old i correct i correct myself
um
but certainly in terms of covid it's
within the risk category ish the
beginning of the risk category i'd say
and he's the third broadcaster to die
from covid i think they mean the third
conservative one right
he's the third one who said don't get a
vaccination and then he died because he
didn't get a vaccination
is that it
um yeah the closer you get to 65 the
less old it seems
i tell you if i thought that so i'm 64
if
if i knew that being 64 felt
the way it feels now
i never would have been afraid of it
because it feels pretty good i gotta say
i'm probably as healthy as i've ever
been
in my whole life
um
but the story about the mark bernier who
tragically died after branding himself
mr anti-vaxx
this is the type of story that tells you
a lot about yourself
doesn't it
what was your reaction to the story
about somebody who was anti-vaxxed and
then died because he didn't get a
vaccine
you kind of were amused some of you were
some of you
you know were maybe had a more human
reaction and just thought it was tragic
and that's the end of it
but
i
i hate to tell you
i was a little bit entertained
and that says something really bad about
me doesn't it
how many of you had the same reaction
and found out that you suck just like i
did
i found out i'm a bad person
because
it kind of entertained me
and that's really bad isn't it
i'm being honest
now i'm not saying that i'm proud of it
because it's not really a reaction you
should be proud of
but
i suck
i suck
yeah and it's a tragedy and i feel so i
feel bad for the family but the reason
it was in the news is that somebody
thought i would be entertained by it
and they were right
sorry
um
by the way i don't care if you get a
vaccination so it's not about that
um
it's more about whether you suck as a
human being and i guess i do
so
i'd like to say again that there are two
positions on ivermectin which would
reveal you to be
uh not part of reason
i've said this before but i have to say
it again if you're positive that it has
been proven that ivermectin works
that hasn't happened
so you're not really part of reason if
you think that happened but if you're
positive it doesn't work
and that it's just horse dewormer and it
couldn't possibly work
well a part of reason there either
because plenty of evidence
there just isn't proof
and we get those too confused right
there's no i would agree that there's no
proof
that ivermectin works but there's a ton
of
suspicious looking evidence
right
so if you're not uncertain about ivory
mechan you're in the wrong place
i saw a graph today somebody
i think there was aj cortez sent this
graph on twitter
and it's a graph that's showing that the
african countries they used ivermectin
have very low death rates from
covet whereas the african countries that
do not use it so much
have much higher much much higher death
rates
so that's all you need to know right
if the countries in africa
that used it are doing relatively great
and the ones that didn't use it are
doing relatively sucky
that's all you need to know now it's not
about vitamin d
it's not about sunlight because it's
africa we're only looking at africa
right they got lots of vitamin d they
got lots of sunlight so if it's only
african countries
and the ones using it ivory mechtin did
great
and the ones who don't use it
did the same as everybody else not using
it
doesn't that tell you something are you
convinced
are y'all convinced now
wait a minute
wait a minute what would be
maybe wrong
what would be maybe wrong with the data
just off the top of your head
what do you think could be wrong with
the data
how about
everything
about everything
what what would the countries that use
ivermectin in africa have in common with
each other
and that would be perhaps than the
countries who are not using ivermectin
what what would the the users of
ivermectin and africa have in common
well somebody says malaria maybe
i don't know
more developed right and less developed
the more developed the country is the
less likely they're using ivermectin
what else would be a correlation the
more developed you are and the better
your health care is what would be
another correlation
another correlation would be
you count you're dead correctly
do you think that a country that has to
use ivermectin because they don't have
good enough health care to do anything
else do you think that country is
counting their deaths correctly
no there's al there's probably a perfect
correlation or a really strong one i
would i would guess not perfect
there's probably a perfect correlation
ish
between countries that can't count
they're dead
they're not testing them they don't know
who died at home and who didn't
and ones that don't have enough health
care to do anything but use ivermec
so now i'm not saying that's the
explanation
i'm saying it's a more obvious
explanation than ivormectin really works
and all the experts in the other
countries didn't notice
right so compare the two possibilities
i think my bird has visited me
oh no it's an actual human this time
um
that that's my security camera beeping
at me
so
i so to take these two possibilities
is the positive what is the greater
possibility that the african study
has good data
and it shows that ivermectin works
but all of the industrial countries
around the world
haven't noticed or don't believe it
is that is that likely could be
it could be i don't think you rule that
out it's perfectly possible
that there is data showing it works in
africa that's not convincing to people
or experts maybe and maybe it's even
accurate
but what's the other possibility
the other possibility is that it's
exactly the countries who are not good
at counting they're dead and that's the
whole thing
could be the whole thing
so i wouldn't believe any graph about uh
ivor mektin or about one country
compared to another every time you do
the
uh every time you uh do that kind of
comparison it's misleading i think all
right um
alex berenson who as you know
was skeptical of many things the
government was doing about this pandemic
got banned by twitter
and uh i was reading an article uh
israel israel's not too happy with him
so
uh haaretz
big israeli publication
was uh
mocking him for his takes on israel and
apparently he was claiming that the
vaccinations weren't working too well in
israel
so this this is
an article in her so this is their claim
i'm just passing along and the claim is
that
alex berenson was saying that the
vaccinations weren't working
in israel
so his initial claim is that they just
weren't working it wasn't keeping
anybody from dying
but once the data was overwhelmingly
showing that that was true
apparently he changed his attack to well
they might be preventing some covet but
what about these side effects
and they started to talk about the side
effects instead of the effectiveness
now that should be your first
flag right as somebody's moving from
their one criticism and immediately goes
to another criticism
so that's what i talk about when i talk
about the the people who brand
themselves as the
uh you know the people the rogues you
know the people who are on the other
side of everything
once you're always on the other side of
everything
you don't have any credibility
now that doesn't mean you're wrong and
i'll say this a million times if anybody
comes back to me later and says
alex berenson was right and you were
wrong i'm going to say so
i always allowed that that's possible
it is 100 percent
possible
that when this is all said and done alex
berenson will be right about everything
completely possible
i don't think so
i'd bet against it and i bet i'd been
heavily against it
we can't rule now based on what we know
at the moment
because any any data you think does has
disproved him i don't know all our data
is crap
i'm not sure anybody can disprove
anybody these days
all right
let's talk about your constitutional
right
i saw cnn said that you do not have a
constitutional right to avoid a
vaccination
what do you think
do you think you have a constitutional
right
to avoid a mandatory vaccine mandatory
mandatory
vaccination
so the argument is there are other
vaccines that are mandatory and those
have passed constitutional muster
so for example we all have to get a
polio vaccination right i think that's
one of the examples
and it's mandatory
it's mandatory
so doesn't that prove that there's no
there's no constitutional right for it
well here's the thing
if you don't get the polio vaccination
or there could be other vaccinations in
this example but i'll just use polio
you would be putting your fellow
citizens at risk
we all agree on that right
that if you don't get vaccinated at
least that's what medical science is
telling you that you would be putting
other people at risk
do you have a constitutional right this
would be cnn's argument which i'll argue
against in a moment do you have a
constitutional right to put other people
at risk
well
apparently you don't
because if your freedom puts somebody
else at risk that's where your freedom
ends right
so do you have the freedom to go take a
crap in somebody's living room
you do not because that would have an
impact on somebody else so your freedom
generally
is limited when it starts having a big
enough impact on other people right we
all have to deal with our smaller
impacts on other people because there's
no way to prevent them but when it's the
big stuff such as life and death
yeah then your freedom is probably going
to be limited by what what you're doing
to other people yeah drunk driving would
be an example
right so i agree with the argument
that the government can force you to do
things you didn't want to do
if it's good for other people
yeah
i see your comment justin
all right
but here's
here's my take on it
what if
you genuinely genuinely believe it would
be dangerous to you
now i can't remember ever thinking
myself hey if i get these i know polio
vaccinations or other i don't remember
ever thinking that it would kill me
like i was never afraid of it because it
felt like it was tested enough even if
it wasn't
so at least i didn't feel like it was
dangerous but what if you feel like
whether you're right or wrong whether
what if you feel like
the vaccination would be dangerous to
you
that's different isn't it
these vaccinations are not
analogous to other vaccinations
because with the other vaccinations you
did have a feel a fairly good feeling
that they've been tested well enough
they weren't that unique
and that they were working against
something where a vaccination works
here we have a case where the
vaccination
works ish but it still you know doesn't
stop it cold
and
because it's newer
and a little less tested
and more technology there is some extra
concern
so here's my constitutional argument and
it goes like this
yes the government can force you to do
something with your body
that you didn't want to
if there's not much danger to you in it
and it would save other people's lives
i take that as constitutionally solid i
think the government can force you
to protect other citizens if there's not
really much of a risk to you
but
what if the government and you have a
very different opinion about the level
of risk
what if you think the risk is
unacceptably high
even if it isn't
and what if the government says no it's
it's low enough
well here's the problem
the government
doesn't have the right to make you harm
yourself
in your opinion
does it can the government make you harm
yourself
in your opinion so i'm not saying it
would harm you i'm saying that if it's
your opinion that it would harm you can
they make you do that because it doesn't
really apply to like the other
vaccinations too much
right you can
you know most people aren't too afraid
of those i know the anti-vaxxers are but
it isn't as big a deal as this is
right
anyway um i think the constitutional
argument that the government can make
you do it doesn't apply to this
so
that's my take on the constitutionality
well apparently north korea is firing up
another nuclear or well nuclear reactor
that they already had
they're firing it back up and it's
capable of producing weapons-grade
plutonium we think
and here's the question
would this have happened under trump
now i probably would because i imagine
that they need electricity as much as
they need to make bombs
but
you know it's being noted that it might
be a negotiating tactic
and that's really just to get us back to
the negotiating table but what exactly
are we negotiating about
does north korea need anything
i mean are we negotiating with them
my best guess is that they probably just
need electricity and this is how they
can get it
so i feel as though we would be safer
under trump because even if trump didn't
like this
he'd probably at least have a friendlier
interaction with them which would make
us all safer i don't know what's going
to do threaten them
what good is that going to do
here's another dog that's not barking
where's my anonymous reports about all
the generals privately disagreeing with
biden about the afghanistan withdrawal
where's that
are you telling me you can't produce one
anonymous story anonymously sourced
story
about the conversation in the room
when the decisions were being made
i don't know it feels like there's
something missing here right
because don't you think that if trump
were president we'd have anonymous
stories that the general said clearly do
not do this mr president
and then the president
in his in his orange badness decided to
do it anyway for political or financial
gain right yeah that's the story right
if trump had been president you'd have
all these anonymous reports where he was
just being dumb and he said all the
right things and he was racist and none
of it would be true
it wouldn't be true
but it would definitely exist
those stories would be there
and you can you can see now that
apparently that kind of story gets
invented by the left more than the right
because if the news on the right
invented stories as
as much as the left at least in this
category of stories
you'd already see it
you know somebody would be reporting
anonymous source
tried to tell biden not to do it but he
just wouldn't listen
i don't know i'd like to hear what
happened behind closed doors
and
the news is suspiciously not telling us
well rasmussen
did a poll and asked people about what
they thought about
biden's performance on the withdrawal of
afghanistan
you would not be surprised that 52
percent of respondents said it was poor
poor job
here's the surprising part
32 percent of likely voters in this
rasmussen poll
think that uh
that biden's job in withdrawing from
afghanistan
was either good or excellent
one-third of the public the voting
public not even the people who aren't
paying attention
the voting public
the people who pay attention
more more than other people
a third of the voting public
thinks thinks biden did an okay job
under withdrawal
what
there's not even a single news source
with that story
there is not one
news outlet
saying he did this right
not the left
not the right
not the middle if the middle exists
anywhere i don't know
what the hell is going on
are the democrats so dug in are that are
they going alissa and milano
is this cognitive dissonance
is it confirmation bias
what is this
i mean seriously
you expect you expect some kind of a
split like this
when the sides disagree
you know if the news is reporting
differently on the right and the left
about who did well or who didn't well
then you'd have a split
population
but what happens when the news on the
left and the right
both know that biden blew it and they're
completely consistent
i don't believe there's anybody going on
the news on any outlet saying well this
looked pretty good to me
i don't think so
how in the world
do 32 percent
say oh that's pretty good that's a good
job
well yes okay blaming it on trump yes
some might be blaming it on trump
that could be
some might be saying you know it doesn't
matter how we get out just get out
maybe
some might be saying well it's gonna be
messy no matter what you do it would
have been messy if trump did it too
maybe maybe
but
i don't know how you could argue that
it's not going poorly
you could argue that maybe it would have
gone poorly no matter who did it
but you can't argue it's not going
poorly
now let me let me throw a compliment to
biden okay
when biden said we are going to get out
by this date that the taliban set
most of the reporting on the left and
the right said oh that's a big mistake
because i'm not sure we could make that
happen and
the people who are below biden in the
administration are saying it's not going
to happen
so it looks like a big old mistake right
now
now if trump were doing the same thing i
would be supporting him the same way it
goes like this
biden is talking to the taliban
right and he's trying to treat them as
respected partners
at least long enough to get our people
out
right what he says after we get our
people out might be different but at the
moment
biden is saying he will respect the
deadline because he's respecting their
their right to put
and here's the second part
um i've seen this in management a
million times
you know the ceo will say i need this in
two weeks and all the underlings say you
can't do this in two weeks
this will take a month no matter what
then the ceo says yeah but you're gonna
do it in two weeks
and then the other link say i don't
think you heard us cannot be done in two
weeks
and then the ceo says do it in two weeks
and then they go do it in two weeks
right so it looks like biden did that it
looks like everybody said it's
impossible it looks like biden said do
it anyway
and i think he's going to get pretty
close
at least in terms of the people we can
get out now the problem is
there are people who can't get to the
airport right and there will be
stragglers forever
but i'm not convinced we won't have some
kind of a system to get them out
i think it'll be
you know a bunch of different efforts i
think we'll have to peck away at it for
a long time
maybe privately people will do some some
things as well as government stuff other
governments will help us etc
but
i don't know at least in that narrow
sense of biden sticking to the deadline
i think he probably made the right
choice on that
even even though it looks stupid
persuasion-wise and negotiation-wise and
managing the taliban's attitude which
matters
because we can't go hard at him while we
still need him
right so i think he might have the
deadline thing might have been the right
move or the only move he could make
i'm seeing some mike cernovich tweets
about the missile attack so there was a
second uh response i guess the u.s did a
missile attack or a drone strike
whatever it was
on a kabul neighborhood
that allegedly killed something like six
to nine people maybe 20. fog of war we
don't know there were children among the
dead allegedly we don't know that for
sure either although there are
photographs we assume that they're
accurate photographs
um
and i guess we the u.s has not confirmed
who who was or was not killed but there
were secondary explosions so i guess
they targeted a car or a vehicle
that allegedly had some suicide
attackers in it
but the explosion caused secondary
explosions and i guess a building blew
up now that doesn't necessarily mean
that there were explosives in the
building but it's indicated there might
have been
so
did you notice there's not much news on
it
so i saw the
the cernovich tweets
and i thought to myself my god that's a
big story
and then i went to the news to check on
the story
and it's almost being ignored in
american media
cnn has one you know minor headline on
it
and the headline doesn't even refer to
it directly like you have to get into
the story to find out it even happened
so they're definitely underplaying it
cnn is underplaying the hell out of this
and
uh i had to read about it in foreign
press
i had to read about it in the guardian
i had to read about it in
al jazeera
and i had to read about it in spectator
who what country is the spectator i
don't know what country that is is that
america
are news max is covering it somebody
says
uk spectators uk
well
um
there's something disturbing about how
well this is being hidden from american
public
in fact
if i hadn't seen cernovich's tweets
i don't even think i would have noticed
it
because it was so silent in the
headlines that i actually wouldn't have
noticed
so somebody says it's on cnn so is it on
the network
because the
the news page on the web is just one
little mention of it it is mentioned
but it looks underplayed
and maybe it should be because
i have mixed feelings
about
civilian casualties and war
if you're targeting terrorists
i mean
you know you have to make horrible
choices
and i tend to be fairly forgiving for
the people who have to make horrible
choices it's war
you know
people die
it's tragic
and there's just nothing that's going to
change that
well here's something interesting
um
there has been one death
from the pfizer vaccine itself
maybe
so it confirmed that the vaccination
caused this one death but it's in new
zealand which is i find interesting
because i don't i don't have the numbers
yet but new zealand is obviously doing
vaccinations but what makes them unique
is that they're they're closed up tight
from the virus itself so they had one
case and they closed the close the
country down again right for one case so
what makes new zealand interesting is
that if there are vaccination
complications
we should be able to see them more
cleanly in new zealand than anywhere
else right because you won't be seeing
any
any coronavirus deaths
so they should have zero deaths
and then
in theory
they would have a pretty good visibility
on how many people the vaccinations
killed now they have one case
that it looks like
yeah it's highly likely because there's
some
biocarditis involved i guess that's the
tell for the vaccinations being
the problem
but the there were comorbidities
involved and it's not so clear
maybe the vaccine was part of it
maybe it wasn't
but i keep an eye on new zealand
vaccination related deaths
we do believe that there aren't many of
them but whatever there are will be
highlighted there now again
if you're going to turn it off because i
mentioned vaccines i'm not promoting it
i'm just telling you where where we
might have some good data that's all um
and then lastly
lastly
that was lastly
i'd like to get to all the notes on my
follow last page but there aren't any it
printed an empty page
yeah one death can never be clear that
that is correct you probably would need
some number of deaths
to give some kind of statistical
confidence but yeah one one death can
never really tell you anything
um but it would tell you something if
there were so few of them
that you couldn't tell anything right
if if we get to the end of this and we
have one
possible death in new zealand from
vaccinations
because remember this is a national
story it means it's the first one
i think i mean maybe we just don't know
about any others but if you only had one
how many people in new zealand have
gotten a vaccination millions
would you say that millions have been
vaccinated in new zealand so far
probably
what's this say
scott pretends alex doesn't exist sad
you talk about alex jones
uh i don't pretend that he doesn't exist
i bet on the show i like alex jones
that doesn't mean he's right about
everything right but i say that about
everybody
but yeah
that you know if you want um i've said
this before
if you can't compliment somebody you
disagree on then you should
check yourself for bias
so i don't agree of course with
everything that alex jones says but
he is a nice guy
i like him
very kind to me very generous you know
when i interacted with him and uh very
likable and obviously very successful
so uh eddie
you know reportedly has been right about
a number of things so
um
so i have some good things to say about
that
um
[Music]
yes the head of the un climate summit
i'm seeing in the comments reminding me
blocked the nuclear energy from
attending
that's right there's a u.n summit about
the climate
the climate
and they decided that it wouldn't be
appropriate to have the nuclear industry
there
i remind you
the nuclear industry is probably the
only hope we have
of changing anything about climate
change as well as controlling space
someday it's the only hope we have now
maybe somebody will invent something
that's a new hope but at the moment
it's the only hope we have for water
desalinization which will be required
and electricity that's dependable it's
our only hope and the un is going to
exclude those
people uh on up says scott take a
vacation for everyone
well maybe i'll do that but it won't
stop me from
live streaming on vacation
when you put the money filter on it
everything looks different right so
follow the money that probably has
something to do with the
nuclear industry being frozen out
um
yes
all right i'm gonna run
and uh i will see you
tomorrow
talk to you then
