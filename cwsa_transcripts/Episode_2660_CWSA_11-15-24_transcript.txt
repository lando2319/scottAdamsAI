those stocks are down a little bit but
I'm hoping that won't last
forever let's do a
show to make this Golden Age
magical get my comments working
here there we go
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need is a cuper muger glass of
tanker Chels sign aen Jugger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee join me
now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better today with a
little oxytocin to
go now if that didn't make your
loneliness go away I don't know what
will cuz we're all here together
today we're
live we're figuring it out we're making
the world a better place it's it's all
good well here's some news about um
science turns out that
eggs and according to a no
study uh they're they might protect your
brain health so if you eat
eggs um you're less likely to have
cognitive dysfunction in your middle age
and
longer now I was quite uh interested in
this study and I was thinking about
taking on a loan to get myself one of
these
eggs uh if any of you been lucky enough
to be able to afford an
egg yeah here they're good they're good
for your brain if you can afford one go
get
one meanwhile in the biggest surprise
and all of science there's a study that
says that alcohol might be bad for your
brain is linked to alzheimer's risk huh
a gigantic surprise alcohol is not good
for you
here's another here's a fun one scitec
daily says there's a
breakthrough in uh
regeneration let's say they're adding
synthetic peptides to your own blood and
it can mimic your own regenerative
hematoma so somehow they take your own
blood and they give it a little boost
with some
peptides and next thing you know you've
got super blood you will be enrolling in
the X-Men School of Excellence
um with your super blood or possibly
it'll just make you
healthier there's a study at cost is
talking about a study that shows that
politics can Trump truth and it's funny
they use the word Trump there so here's
what they
did they gave people various facts some
true some fake about politics and they
noticed that people were more likely to
believe things that agreed with them
politically
huh I wonder how they could have saved
some
money well you could have just asked me
yes people do tend to agree with the
people on their side and think that
that's totally right and everybody else
is totally wrong it's true it's true I
know it's a shocker shocker but they
found that
Trump they say that people who favor
Trump were more likely more likely to
believe
fake news if it agreed with their
team huh raises an interesting question
doesn't it
apparently there is a group of um
scientists who know what news is
real now wouldn't it be helpful instead
of wasting their time on this study if
they had simply said hey we're
scientists that we know which news is
real not only do we know which news is
real but we know it's so C certainly
that we can have a test in which we put
the news we know is real versus the news
we know isn't real so thank goodness
there's some people who know which news
is
real okay now I think they probably
didn't use real news they probably just
made up some stuff and I think almost
anybody could tell made up stuff so I
don't think there's any scientific
validity validity to this
whatsoever but I still believe the
conclusion and you didn't really need to
do a test to find out that people like
to agree with their
side oh
surprising I'm trying to figure out if
the stories about
Infowars are true did I hear that Alex
Jones
debunked the report that the owner of
the onion bought Infowars
assets so do we even know what happened
there I I'm getting all kinds of weird
conflicting stories so the only thing I
know
is
uh somebody in the comments felt it was
necessary to remind me that I'm not a
scientist um should it also be necessary
to mention that French Press is a good
way to make coffee swimming is the best
form of
exercise and that food that Universal
food it might be soil and green and
something reminds you of The Matrix so
the NPCs are here to say all the obvious
stuff so if anybody knows what happened
to Infowars could you let me know but
I'm having trouble understanding why
infow Wars needs
assets what assets do they need I mean
few cameras and a
laptop I mean they don't really need the
building do they you could do it from
your
bedroom I don't
know well here's something cool
according to a user on x called vorio
vorio um there's a new paper in
science and uh they've used AI on
DNA now DNA you could think of it almost
like a bunch of zeros and ones it's
almost like a code or a language if you
will now ai is good with languages so
it's good with human languages and it's
good with uh every kind of computer
programming language so it's not a big
surprise that when you show a DNA it
treats it like a language or it could so
in other words in in the same way it
could arrange bits to make a computer
program or it could arrange words to
make sentences that you understand
apparently there's some indication that
it can look at DNA and figure out how to
arrange it and or modify it to get
better results
so
apparently so here's how I understand it
it's POS it's possible that I don't
understand this correctly because I'm
trying to interpret it from Material
that's above my pay grade but I think
what it means is that it looks at DNA as
if it were any other language and then
it can design its own sentences which
means it could rearrange DNA
hypothetically and then you could put it
through some kind of crisper or some
technology I don't understand to
actually rearrange the DNA and you could
not only make new forms of
medicines potentially but you could also
make new life
forms so we are uh right on the
verge of being able to design and
actually
Implement actually Implement using using
technology to actually arrange the DNA
and create a new life form so that's
right around the corner and you thought
that flame thrower robot dogs were
interesting ah wait until we make a
giant wouldn't it be cool to have
Giants you know like we just start
creating military
Giants Well we got one who's 100 feet
tall well uh project Veritas has a uh
undercover video of a un worker a
manager uh telling telling the person on
the undercover video that the only way
the UN can make some serious money is if
if there's a war so they like Wars and
they like Nikki Haley because they can
make more money from the
wars quote the only way you make money
in the UN is if you go to war you get
paid more who gets paid more if they go
to
war what job gets paid more if you're at
War I mean I could see if the the actual
military people are deployed they might
get military pay or something but do the
managers get paid more how's that work I
don't
know I'm not sure I believe that um and
then this manager said 90% of the United
Nations employees are
squatting I could point to people every
single day in the building who don't
work uh what is the UN it's an amorphous
body of nothingness now this is coming
from a manager at the UN now I don't
think that this one manager is
necessarily expressing a universally
accurate view but certainly I would look
at this whole un situation to see if
it's doing anything for us that we want
done I'm not entirely sure it's doing
what we want done all the time so it may
I'm sure it has benefits I just don't
know the pluses and minuses all right
this is funny James Carville
uh is actually going on the da he he
actually said in a in an interview quote
our side won't tolerate
lies so James Carville who's the
smartest guy the Democrats have
apparently um he believes or at least
he's willing to say in public I don't
know what he really
believes that because the corporate news
on the on the left is more you know
corporate and
professional that uh they won't let the
Democrats get away with
lies so the lies are mostly on the right
because the media on the right lets them
get away with
lies Joe Biden ran on the fine people
hoax and didn't get fact checked once by
the entire media on the left not once
not a single time not one time during an
entire the 2020 election not once and
all those
not once did the left media fact check
him on the fine people hoax the primary
reason he ran for
office and uh and Carville said no we
got we're all the honest
ones so Carville thinks that fox and
Newsmax and one America that they're
just out there allowing all these lies
he goes quote but our side won't
tolerate lies okay if a Democrat goes on
TV and says some lie the new Republic's
going to say that's not right or the New
York Times is going to say that's not
right so how and I'm serious when I say
this one side is constrained by the
truth yeah I sure feel sorry for those
Democrats were constrained by the
truth does he believe any of this what
do you think I I think he couldn't
possibly believe it but on the other
hand he talks like he
does because he's he's sort of a
straight
shooter so you don't know when the
straight shooter is decided that you
know maybe a lie is what gets him what
he needs I don't know it's hard to
believe if you believe this is
true you're kind of starting in a bad
place he
says all right well uh Nancy Pelosi
who's 84 years old has filed for
reelection so we might get her into
she's like a
thousand um now do you think the
Democrats have learned
anything if Nancy Pelosi gets reelected
at age 84 or
85 um well that's she's going to run in
2026 don't you think that that would be
kind of evidence that they didn't learn
a damn
thing do you think the country is
looking
for maybe a little younger leadership on
the left
on the right Trump is getting up there
in age but he's surrounded by younger
people who are pretty Dynamic so it
looks different and he doesn't act that
old he's he's got tons of energy still
but uh Nancy Pelosi good luck
Democrats meanwhile California still has
1.7 million uncounted
ballots how long ago did we have that
election or alleged election and
California hasn't counted 1. 7 million
and they're apparently they're taking
pride in not being
rushed see here's what I think was the
problem uh where California went off the
rails is they never should have decided
to use the weed dispensaries as ballot
counting
centers you should have just kept those
separate the whole time no I made that
up they did not use weed dispensaries as
ballot counting centers because if they
had they'd be done by now
meanwhile there are allegations of
voting irregularities in Wisconsin
you've probably heard of them Gateway
pundits reporting more on it but
apparently there was a reportedly there
was a 4 a. dump of ballots that went 90%
to one candidate which one do you think
it was let's see there was a late drop
of ballots 90% of them went to one
candidate let's see how many of you
could guess was it the Democrat or the
Republican who who do you think got the
90% just take a guess see how close you
can get it's a 50/50 right it's a toss
up so did 90% of the votes go to the
Democrat or the
Republican and anybody want to take a
wild guess on this one oh yes it was the
Democrat yeah quite surprisingly 90% of
the late night dump went to the
Democrat um there is a widespread
concern
the they're trying to let's see what
else is um and now the uh Republican
candidates talking about it because it's
I guess it's it seems to be according to
them grossly obvious that there's
cheating grossly obvious what do you
think maybe I don't know all I know for
sure is there's a
report um but there's suddenly uh
108,000 absenc B came and one person got
90% of the votes do you think you could
ever have 90% of the the
90% out of
180,000 it's not really a thing is it
okay if that's
true so you have to worry about any
parts of the report being true but if
it's true that 90% of the votes were for
one candidate out of 180,000 ballots I I
would I would call that proof of uh
rigging
well I don't even need to look into it
really if it came in at 4:00 a.m. and it
was 90% for one person and it was
180,000 votes you don't have to look
into it too carefully you can just throw
the whole thing out I mean
that's just obviously
rigged but the part you don't know is if
the claim of 90% of the votes being one
way is
true right so if that's not true then
then nothing was found there was we so I
would look to get that validated with a
couple of sources to make sure that
you're not claiming a cracken when there
is none meanwhile over in uh
Pennsylvania um the Republican who
declared the winner by number of sources
but there's still a recount I think
there's going to be a recount and it
looks like the mark Elias and the
Democrats might have a play here so they
might try to eliminate some votes or add
some votes and see if they can get a
changed election so I didn't realize
that Mark Elias was part of getting uh
Al Franken elected in that election that
was so close they had to do the recount
I think and then Mark Elias managed to
either include votes new votes or
exclude some votes that have been
counted until they changed the outcome
so that's a real thing that could happen
um so we've got two states
that on the surface appear to be
rigged do you do you think that's fair
on the surface so I don't know if the
claims are
correct but there are uh claims coming
from credible people so that doesn't
mean they're right but the people seem
credible and the claims seem specific
pretty specific claims and I would think
maybe there's a way to check on at least
some of that but the the stuff that
happens legally would be all transparent
and we just wouldn't like it if it goes
the way you don't
like meanwhile apparently some of the
Democrat blue cities are uh trying to
get rid of their migrant shelters before
Trump's inaugurated because they think
Trump will start deporting people you
know if you were going to deport
migrants what would be more convenient
than having them all in one migrant
shelter the easiest way to round them up
is if they're in a sanctuary City in a
big
shelter yeah are you telling me that
entire hotel is filled with migrants
yeah we put them in the
hotel okay uh let's take everybody in
the hotel and send them back now I don't
think that works if they're Asylum
people because the Asylum people are
here legally um at least temporarily
legally but uh I can see why they would
be racing to get rid of their San cities
now some of it is because I think the uh
there was a market drop in um people
coming in so I I think that they're
already trying to change their game
because whoever comes in in the next few
months is definitely going to get sent
back you know anybody who comes in today
has a pretty high chance of being set
back if they get
caught so New York City had a migrant
shelter on Randall's Island it had up to
300 people in it they're going to shut
that down by
February and and there apparently the
wave of new migrants arriving in New
York has significantly slowed and
170,000 uh are already in the shelter oh
have already moved on so those were
170,000 migrants were in shelters but
have somehow moved on to something
closer to a permanent
situation but there is a conspiracy
theory by the Democrats that Elon Musk
stole the election somehow using
starlink now I don't know if there's any
evidence that starlink was used for any
part of any of the election but the
Democrats need something so according to
wired there's a uh there's a rumor going
around on the Democrat side I haven't
seen it on social media but they say
it's going around that the election was
stolen good luck with
that the daily wire is reporting that uh
Anthony
blinkin says that Biden's going to
funnel as much money as possible to
Ukraine before Trump takes over man what
does that sound
like I'd love to I'd love to think that
they're doing that for all the right
reasons but if they know that Trump's
going to take over and just end the war
shouldn't they just end the war now you
know wouldn't it be smarter for them to
say hey Mr Trump you can end this anyway
why don't we start we'll get we'll get
the end of the war going we'll get them
talking set up a meeting you know get
you all set up to end this war when you
come in no instead they're going to send
them as much money as
possible as much as possible I'll tell
you everybody who voted for Trump is
feeling happy about it at this
moment yep send our money to another
country as fast as possible Tony blinkin
to achieve uh nothing apparently
let's see then there's
a there's a report by Christina Wong and
Breitbart that uh the Pentagon is trying
to get rid of its Dei records because
Trump said he was going to fire the
generals that were big on Dei now I've
got a problem with
that
hypothesis or that strategy I guess um
I've never been in the
military but correct me if I'm wrong
don't you think almost everybody who
implemented Dei was just taking orders
even the
generals were there generals who were
just sort of doing their own thing and
they decided that Dei was going to be
what they were going to pursue or was it
just a general military order to do more
Dei and then generals were maybe
competing to see who could do more of it
or do it better but I don't quite
understand fire ing people in the
military for Dei when they would have
had to do it if it was ordered what
choice did they have why would you fire
somebody for following an
order you know unless those generals
knew it was an illegal order and the
country wasn't treating it like it was
illegal so certainly there are some
people at the top who need to be
replaced I feel confident in saying that
I don't know that you need to go
all the way through all the generals
there got to be some generals who are
just taking orders so I don't know how
you sort that
out
anyway um but I love the fact that
everybody's all worried that uh truth
and um the end of racism might be
coming all right and they're struggling
to hide in evidence well I would to if
St them um ran Paul says he's going to
reinstate Trump's remain in Mexico
policy I guess he'll be the senate
committee chairman for the whatever is
the right committee for that the Senate
Homeland Security and governmental
Affairs
committee so that's
good uh Washington Times is reporting
that meanwhile the uh editor-in-chief of
the of Scientific American has resigned
Under Pressure because she called all
Trump voters fascists and
bigots uh she she she decided to take
some time off and think about what comes
next yeah I looked at some of her uh
posts just batshit crazy
racist just crazy and uh how did she
become the editorinchief of the
Scientific
American do you think that was Dei
well based on her social media post she
doesn't seem very bright or very nice
she's she's definitely not nice but to
publicly put these opinions out there
when you run a magazine that's also
stupid so at the very least she's not
very nice and she's stupid so yeah she
needs to find a find maybe a job that
doesn't have science in the name
um here's a fun one if it's true Zero
Hedge is reporting that the FBI official
who oversaw the January 6 pipe bomb
probe remember January 6 there was
reports of pipe bombs and then we don't
know who planted them but luckily
there's always cell phone information
about where people are so you could
check the cell phone information and you
could pretty well find out who is in
that area at a certain time and and you
could then match the time to the video
because there's security video and you
would largely know for
sure who planted them because you'd have
the video you'd have the phone
information there was only one person
there at that time and there he is right
on
video pretty easy and then we were told
by the FBI official who's in charge of
that that they received corrupted files
from the phone company and that
amazingly and and they admitted it's
just the weirdest thing this never
happens but just the exact information
that they needed about this one this one
situation the data was corrupt wow so it
quite the gigantic coincidence because
it really it would be weird for that to
be
corrupt and then we found out that the
phone company say we didn't give anybody
any corrupt information and if we did
nobody mentioned it and by the the way
it doesn't look corrupt to
us the the FBI lied about the pipe
bombs January
6 was probably exactly what you thought
it was a giant FBI op now there is
definitely not enough evidence to prove
that's true there's definitely enough
evidence to prove it's the main
Theory would you agree with that I can't
say it's true I can say it would be
stupid to take it out from the top
Theory it's the top Theory right if
nothing changes it will still remain the
top theory of what happened that day
right something something big would have
to change my mind at this point if the
pipe bombs were really covered
up yeah we have to assume the worst
about the
FBI and maybe the FBI will get to get
fixed
uh MSNBC had a guest on to call Pete
Heth uh everybody knows a white
supremacist that according to the guest
whose name was not on the screen which
is probably pretty smart because I
wouldn't want anybody to know my name
either if I said something like that
that just says casually that Pete Heth
is a known white
supremacist and then Chris Hayes sits
there and listens to it and does not say
something such such as why would you say
that or what evidence do you have that
he's a white
supremacist because obviously there is
none there's no evidence he's a white
supr duh uh and uh but the guest on
MSNBC was a racist obviously and uh
Chris Hayes has some some questions that
need to be answered to why would he
platform a
racist I mean a real obvious overt not
hiding it kind of a racist why would
they do that and maybe that's why the
total value of MSNBC is checking 75
cents yeah can't sell it at
all well Scott Jennings who does a great
job on CNN uh representing the Trump
side of the world some say he's up for
discussion as the White House Press
Secretary um and that's making some
people of CNN wonder why they're keeping
him on the air because if he's just sort
of in the pocket for Trump why should
they have him on
CNN can uh I explain this to the people
at CN who are confused why the person
they hired to express the point of view
of the Trump people might be under
consideration to be a person who
expresses the point of view of the Trump
people which is exactly what he was
hired on CNN to do to express the point
of view of the Trump people and so it
would be a problem if he's being
considered for a job to represent the
opinion of the Trump people and that's
CNN for you now I don't know which
idiots on CNN thought that the person
who is perfect for the job and was hired
for that exact Express purpose is now
wrong for the job because it's been
proven that he's right for the job by
being considered for a job that's even
better than that that's the same
job expressing one size point of
view
wow so anyway the Washington Post was
reporting that CNN's wondering about
that Jeremy bar at the Washington
Post um the the new elected LAPD
Chief says he's not going to help the
feds with
deportation so Los Angeles has
what decided to leave the
Union uh on what basis does a local
Police Department chief get to tell the
United States government that they
can't police the
illegals so I wonder how much Weaponry
they have in LA because they're going to
go up against the the entire military of
the United
States how in the world is this going to
work out don't you think he has he's
going to have to fold
right I think it's the thing you say
when you your first day on the job but I
don't think any of this Sanctuary City
stuff's going to hold Tom homman already
said good luck we're we're going to do
what we're going to do and he doesn't
look like a guy who messes around and
he's going to have the backing of the
president and the entire
government
so good luck Los
Angeles um
I saw saw a video showing the El
Salvador prisons so as you know um
president buelli down in El Salvador is
getting a lot of credit for lowering uh
especially gang crime but the way he did
it was he just locked up basically
everybody with a tattoo I'm exaggerating
but that's pretty close because the gang
members are heavily tattooed so it looks
like he just built um
enormous three football stadiums it was
described buildings that are just full
of gang
members and they showed the conditions
of the gang
members they have
water uh a little I don't know bucket or
something that like 50 of them use for a
bathroom they're all in the same cell
but there are lots of these cells with a
whole bunch of people in them every cell
has a guard an armed guard standing in
front of the cell now there are mult
multiple multiple people in each little
unit but there's literally a guard 24
hours just standing there looking at
them armed guard because they're the
most dangerous people in the world
and uh they don't even have cushions on
beds so they're sleeping on hard ground
drinking water probably not eating the
best food and I think they'll just be
there
forever
so it's a weird situation
because on one hand I'm completely in
favor of it on the other hand I would
add one thing I think they should have a
suicide option because if they're never
getting out I don't know who would want
to live like that so why don't you give
them an option of killing
themselves you know peacefully like you
give them the suicide pills and you say
all right we command of your cell we'll
put you in this special cell just take
these pills
and then we'll take your body off to be
cremated don't you think you would get
rid of a lot of them I mean assuming
that they know they're going to be there
forever and if they got out it wouldn't
be that great
either let them kill themselves because
what I saw look like
torture again I'm not saying they
shouldn't torture him because it looks
like they were pretty bad dudes so maybe
they deserve everything they get maybe
it's better that they're tortured before
they they die but it seems like you
could save a lot of time and money and
space if you gave them the option I know
that would seem it would seem like
murder if you put them in a position
where killing themselves was more
pleasant than than staying in jail
but um buelli made a joke on it and on X
so he he's happy about it and certainly
working anyway do you think we're going
to do something like that in the United
States no we will not
um so a axios did a uh little study and
said that uh none of the voters in their
their latest focus group The engio SEO
focus group that's the best one I guess
none of them think that uh Trump being a
having a close relationship with Elon
Musk is a good
idea
really really you can't find anybody
in a focus group who thinks that working
with the smartest most capable man on
the planet could be good for you when
he's working on the hardest problem in
the world which is the reorganizing the
government and the debt and he's the
person you would trust the most with
that exact
job and you're not you're worried about
that that's the thing they're worried
about now I do understand I do
understand they don't want him to to you
know be like a shadow president or
something but what do you think you're
going to get bad
decisions what happens if Elon mus
becomes a little bit too much too
influential what what problem exactly
does that
cause cu the whole time I'm just looking
at it and I'm thinking God I hope he's
influential like I hope hope Trump's
taking him seriously I hope he lets him
you know do his
thing the only thing I want is for Elon
to do his thing because there's I don't
think there's any chance that he's in it
for any reason other than help the
country um no obviously it's good for
business but it should be good for
everybody's business if they get the
government out of their back
pocket so that's a weird opinion
but I guess it's widely held by some
people in a focus
group speaking of
um so axios is also reporting that uh
Trump's initial cabinet picks show that
he's uh moving towards uh getting rid of
the U an well he wants to be let's see
how they say it he's moving swiftly to
implement anti-trans anti- Dei and
antisocial Justice agenda that
underpinned his election does that sound
like a fair way to say it that he's
moving to implement anti-trans
anti- Dei and antisocial
Justice here's another way to word it he
is dismantling systemic racism in the
government and he won a mandate by a
landslide to do
that is that
wrong right listen to my wording and
then listen to axios and tell me if my
wording is more accurate right there's
again is that he's anti-trans anti- Dei
and antisocial
Justice and I say that he's dismantling
systemic
racism and by the way he's not
anti-trans nobody's
anti-trans this just not a thing you
might be anti- giving trans more rights
than you think it makes sense for the
other people in the public but that's
not exactly
anti-trans um but he's anti- Dei which
is racist so he's anti-ra R ISM and he's
antisocial Justice because the way it's
used is racist and sexist so he's
dismantling bigotry in the
government that's what he's doing
meanwhile uh do you remember former FBI
deputy director Andrew McCabe back from
the Russia collusion days he says that
Matt Gates uh who's nominated to be the
Attorney General quote couldn't get
hired by the FBI
huh so is that true he couldn't get
hired by the FBI but he could be the
attorney general in charge of all that
stuff
well probably true I'm going to say true
because there are enough like
allegations running around that maybe
that'd be a problem but I think this is
a fun game and we should play some more
of it what kind of jobs our leaders
couldn't get for example Joe Biden I
don't believe could get a job as a
babysitter you know what I
mean I don't think he
could how about K Harris could she get a
job as running your uh AA meetings
probably not probably
not could com Harris get a job that
required a drug
test I don't know good question
could
she could k Harris get a job as the head
of the
FBI again I'm pretty sure you'd have to
tra pass a drug test vice president and
president didn't have to pass any drug
test right so I don't know just just
suspicions I don't have any proof that
she does any
drugs all right so that's a fun game
what what you could not be hired to do
um Hugh Hugh huitt is saying that maybe
the gates nomination is some kind of 4D
chess you ever heard that
before that uh Trump and uh Gates may be
running a play and the real purpose of
it is to get Gates out of his ethics
probe so he's under an Ethics
investigation in the house they haven't
completed it but since he's resigned and
he resigned under the the cover of
nomination for AJ that uh they would
naturally drop the
investigation although there's some
thinking that the paper might be
released but it wouldn't be it wouldn't
be binding on anything because he
wouldn't be a member at that point um so
what do you think of that do you think
that the whole thing was a clever plan
to Simply avoid him being um covered by
that proceeding
and do you think
that
um well I think I think it could be just
one of the
benefits I think that genuinely um Trump
would feel more comfortable with his you
know most
loyal uh
Hellraiser in that position so if it's
not if he doesn't want Matt gates in
that position then my question would be
who's
better what who are we going to see that
would be a better choice now there
definitely you could get somebody who
would be less controversial so that's
easy and less controversy is worth
something right that's not nothing so
you know indeed he could get somebody
less controversial but could he get
somebody who would trust more who would
more likely pull the weeds out by the
roots
than than uh Gates I don't think so he
might actually he's very high on my list
as first
choice so we'll see it could be that he
wants him as AG it could be that it also
solves that the problem of the the
ethics thing could be but let me say
this as unambiguously as possible I
don't care what Matt Gates did as a
single
man some of the things he's being
accused
of you know it would be you could say oh
I wish he hadn't done that or he
shouldn't brag about his you know his
success with the ladies yeah okay I
don't
care you I mean I could agree with you
that maybe less of that would be better
but I don't care and you can't make me
care about his sex life now there's
allegations that there was something
illegal that I'm not even going to
mention but he's not being brought up on
any legal charges so if the if the
government's legal mechanism can't find
anything that they think is worth
pursuing then why am I going to listen
to some
report if I've got a legal system that
says Nope we'll take a pass on this
doesn't look like we could make him
guilty and yet there's some report that
acts like he is
guilty I think I'm going to go with
Innocent till proven guilty
like that's I've said it a million times
that's got to be the standard so if you
can't prove it and you're not taking him
to court I don't want to hear it not I'm
not even a little bit interested if it's
not illegal and something he did when he
was single I wouldn't even care if it
was something he did when is married
because that's not my business but yeah
I don't care so you can't make me care
you cannot make me care what you did as
a single
man well Ezra clein who writes for the
new yorktimes times which would make him
one of the famous left-leaning people
around um he was slamming the people who
who were saying that Fox News and the
like are the are the reason that Trump
won um and I like how he put it because
he's not he's not Min any words he goes
this idea that like uh uh oh no the
economy is actually good or crime is
actually down that this is all just Fox
News he says like shut the f up with
that Klein fumed
uh he was on he was on uh one of pod
save one of those podcasts um and he
said uh if you just talked to people who
lived in the cities you would know that
people were really really unhappy and he
said that if you'd spent any time
basically talking to real people who
lived in the cities you would have
totally known that Trump was going to do
better than the media was telling you
because people were pissed and
um he said he
mentioned he says the thing that
surprised me least about the election
was the sharp red shift in these big
cities because if you talk to anybody
who lives in them they are
Furious
now do you know why this is national
news this is just one person with an
opinion and we all have opinions and
there are like thousands of famous
people with opinions why is this one
famous at least famous in politics why
is this one well-known person his
opinion why is it national news why is
everybody talking about it do you know
why because it's a Democrat telling the
truth that that's I'm not joking that's
actually the reason there's a Democrat
telling the truth so it's national
news right because there's nothing about
this there's nothing about this opinion
that's new provocative Innovative he's
not reframing anything he's saying what
the majority of Americans already knew
because they just voted in the new
president so all he's doing is agreeing
with the majority of Americans were
looking at the same stuff he's looking
at and it's National news
because he told the
truth just hold that in your mind for a
moment hold in your mind that it's
national news
that a Democrat told the
truth and like an obvious truth like one
that we all see is true we don't have to
do any
research well I'm going to give him full
credit so you know it would be easy to
go negative on this and say where were
you before and why weren't you speaking
out and why don't you why didn't you
vote for Trump if you believe this and
all that but how about how about we just
say thank you how about we just say
thank
you if there's any other Democrats who
want to say something that's obviously
true I'm here for it and I'm happy to
say bygones or bygones and if you were
wrong before or you're playing for a
team before but now you see things a
little differently I'm here for you so
Unity I think a little bit of at least
at least being
open to Unity is absolutely worth doing
we're in you know it's the beginning of
the golden age so if I hear something I
like from the team that was opposed to
me up until now I'm going to say good
for you now you heard the news that AOC
removed her pronouns from her profile on
X I haven't heard why she did it but I
assume it's for the obvious reason that
she doesn't think that's the focus or
where it should be to which I say good
for you I can disagree with you on other
stuff but how about I'll just say good
for you find a little unity in that
too so it's not that Unity is going to
break out and we're all going to be
singing Kumbaya but just as a citizen of
America that I want America do to do
well I feel like anytime I see any
movement toward just common sense and
telling the truth that I'm going to give
it a shout out so good for as recline I
think that you did something useful for
Democrats
meanwhile uh even at least one judge has
decided that with Trump coming into
power and the likelihood that he will uh
he will pardon the J Sixers at least one
J Sixers trial was postponed because
there was no point in doing it so I
guess the judge said just a waste of
time he's going to get pardoned anyway
to which I say good work judge that is
the correct answer I like seeing the
common sense also
in the Judiciary so I don't know if this
judge is leaning left or right or who
appointed this judge but it's true that
no matter who appointed the judge this
would be a waste of the Public's money
there's no point in putting this person
further into the the system because
they're going to be freed in a few weeks
so yes this was the right right
direction right
decision over in North Korea Kim Jong-un
apparently is going big on suicide
drones so they're going to do major
manufacturing of suicide drones to which
I ask this following
question why isn't America making all
kinds of suicide drones in
America I I keep hearing that we can't
catch up to China China's manufacturing
you know drones like
crazy what is it that makes us unable to
make a
drone we obviously have the technology
we could obviously use robotss to do
most of the manufacturing so it can't be
that much more expensive to make it in
the United States and if North Korea can
make swarms of drones are you telling me
that North Korea can spin up a drone
Factory and we can't because why they
get help from China or something maybe
China's helping um or is it
Russia is the because we now know that
um thousands of North Korean troops have
been sent to help Russia in the Ukraine
war so is it possible that Russia is the
technical and maybe even investment help
and they're building a less bombable
drone Factory how about that if you if
you make a drone Factory and you put it
in
Russia do you think you could trust
Ukraine not to bomb the Drone Factory
you canot no matter where you put it in
Russia um Ukraine is already shown that
they'll take out like a a weapons Depot
so of course they would take out your
drone Factory but what if you put your
drone Factory in North
Korea do you think Ukraine is going to
take out a drone Factory in North
Korea I don't think so so it might be a
pretty clever place for the bad guys to
hide a drone Factory and I'm going to
say that North Korea is not doing the
hard lifting on their own they must be
getting some help either from Russia or
China or
both Wall Street Journal says that Trump
is vowed to remake education in the US
by getting rid of the woke stuff in the
classroom yay funding private school
tuition we'll see how much of that
happens and abolishing the Department of
Education uh but he also has this idea
of accredited a a government
accredited college that anybody could go
to everybody gets in I guess and they
can take what classes they want and get
it accredited now I think most of that
would be online and
AI so we'll see where that goes but I
don't think I'd want a college that you
didn't have a physical experience with
if your college is totally online and
you don't at least meet with your
classmates or meet for study periods
with people taking the same classes uh
that would be a pretty empty and cold
experience for three or four years
so I think we need to work on the
alternative
education social
part because I don't think it's good for
kids to have no
social you know contact and I know the
homeschoolers do a good job of it the
homeschoolers you make sure they get
together with other homeschoolers and
stuff so they're already doing a good
job of it but if the government weighs
in more heavily um I hope that they make
sure that the physical connections with
people are maintained
somehow well RFK Jr is picked as a
Health and Human Services secretary so
that's the the group that's ahead of all
the smaller federal health agencies so
that would give him power over
everything health
related I can't even tell you how much I
love this I just absolutely love
it are are we getting what is
this I'm seeing some
anti-Semitism that uh needs to stop
right
now is there something going on going on
in the comments over
there yeah well I just saw something go
by that you need to stop that right away
none of none of that is okay that is not
okay all right uh
um so I I forgot that Rachel LaVine was
the uh Health and Human Services
secretary
before so I don't have a comment on that
I'll just note that going from Rachel
LaVine to RFK Jr is a pretty big change
in priorities pretty big
change and uh I'm all in I'm all in on
this now I do think
that if the way farmer works and even
the way Food Works is uh is radically
changed we are guaranteed to have two
things happen we're going to have some
pretty deadly disruptions probably in
our
Pharma uh
business in the long run I think will be
way better in the short run it might
deny us some medicines that work better
than they don't work and in the long run
though I think it's just giant potential
Improvement same with food in the short
run we might learn that some of the
foods that we routinely are so dangerous
they should be immediately taken off the
market which will cause other food
prices to go up which will cause us to
have fewer
choices so my guess is that you can't do
any major reforms for for the Pharma
approvals or for the food
approvals without major disruptions now
it's the it's the fear of major
disruption that makes anybody not change
anything because you don't want the the
negative to be greater than the benefit
you're trying to get
but when you reach a point where your
food and your medicine is killing you
and you don't trust either one then the
risk of A disruption becomes
manageable so here's the thing I want to
tell you if you think that RFK can do
what he wants without major disruptions
pretty major to the way you live and
maybe even people you know will have
some health outcomes that's all going to
happen you're you're going to get some
problems right so Ju Just know for sure
that you can't make a change this big
without you know breaking a few eggs to
make your omelette some eggs are going
to get broken but we have to get past
this we we have in institutions that are
just broken and we we've got to fix it
and the only way to do it is you know a
bunch of people are going to leave and
they're going to take with them some
institutional knowledge we'll have to
you know build it back we can build it
back better to borrow a phrase but not
until there's a lot of problems in
between now the fact that RFK Jr is
apparently
Fearless he apparently has no fear of
anything physical social or political
uh or phys yeah physical social he
doesn't appear to have any fear or he
operates as if he doesn't which is even
more
awesome but talk about the right guy for
the right job at the right time it's
just the thing that's blowing my mind is
the
timing you know a number of people made
the analogy that um I I some of us call
it a pirate ship you know Trump's uh
collection of Extraordinary People um
others are liking it to the
founders and it's like a refounding like
we're being founded for a second time
but what are the odds that RFK Jr would
be available at the same time that vake
and Elon Musk and tulsy
gabard um are all
available and they're not really
available they're just willing to do it
you know Elon Musk is the busiest person
in the world but made himself available
I've never seen anything like that I've
never seen anything close to it do you
remember when
uh you used to hear that Lincoln had the
uh what do you call it the advisers that
were what was that phrase for the
advisers that were on the other side he
had a team of adversaries what was that
called there's a famous phrase for it
you'll see it in the comments um but
Trump actually did that drump Trump has
the
Republican um the Republican
Administration Team of Rivals Team of
Rivals thank you um but he's got a I'll
call them A Team of Rivals except that
when it comes to this they're all on the
same same
side so he actually he he actually got
the best version of a Team of Rivals you
could ever get which is a Team of Rivals
who change sides because the other side
wasn't doing it that's the best you can
do you know you don't want a Team of
Rivals that still thinks their side is
right that that's just trouble I mean I
could see why there's some advantage to
it as well because you get a hearty
debate but if you can get your Team of
Rivals to be people who publicly
repudiated the team they're leaving and
said they just can't get this stuff done
and this is going to kill us all and
then they go to the team that might be
able to get it done and save us all you
can't get better than that so I am so
happy to be
alive at at this great coincidence that
those particular characters are all up
for the fight and I'm and I'm not even
naming all of them right I mean you
could throw in Bill Amman you could
throw in you know half a dozen other
people JD Vance you know there's a lot
of people you could throw in who are all
in on the fight I know I am I'm
definitely all
in but Elizabeth Warren is not so happy
she um she just said on msnb
MSNBC uh that tulsy gabard quote has
clearly been in Putin's
pocket
really
really Tulsi gabard has clearly been in
Putin's pocket and what evidence do we
have of that
none but here's my
advice if you watch the Elizabeth Warren
um clip which is on X and probably going
around today turn off the sound and then
just look at her crazy face she can't
hide the crazy I mean her
face it looks like this
distorted like demon face if you hear
the words it doesn't sound so bad
because because the words actually come
out sounding like regular sentences and
stuff but if you look at the
face the face is just torted with some
kind of weird mental illness or lying or
something it just doesn't look right and
I'm not saying this is every Democrat
has a weird liar face but there's so
many of them that do that it's
weird you don't see that on the
Republicans at all like who has who has
a Adam Schiff
face shiff face who has an Adam Schiff
face who's a Republican or or Elizabeth
Warren distorted mentally ill face now
you notice um there are plenty of
Democrats I don't say that
about um I've seen Al Franken for
example on TV he doesn't seem to have a
weird distorted face he's just someone
who might disagree with me politically
doesn't appear to be crazy at all not
even a little bit I just disagree with
them but they have so many people that
msnb put snbc platforms that you turn
off the sound and you just go oh I
wouldn't hire you to work at McDonald's
or the
FBI
so that's
happening anyway today is Friday I'm
told so this is the day that the weekend
starts that is an hour of the finest
entertainment you've ever had but uh I
want to see in the comments how many of
you watch The Morning Show because it
makes you feel less
lonely like some of you are watching for
the content I hope but how many of you
just feel like because it's sort of
interactive and it's live it just it
just feels like there's somebody in your
house right now me and that there are a
bunch of other people who are
observers yeah in the comments there
more people on locals who are there to
be less uh
lonely so let me make this PCT to those
of you who are feeling lonely who are
not on locals so locals is a
subscription
service seven bucks a month but you
could get a discount if you do a year in
advance and it's got the Dilbert comic
and the Dilbert calendar comic and the
robots read nudes comic which is Naughty
and then a bunch of political stuff and
memes that you might find too much for
you so the there's low censorship on
locals so for some of you that won't
work you'll be seeing stuff you don't
want to see I'll be honest about that
but if you don't care about that or you
find it fun I find I find the memes the
more inappropriate they are the funnier
they are to me so on locals we embrace
the inappropriate as
inappropriate so we're not I don't have
to judge it I just laugh at it it's like
oh that's so inappropriate but that
doesn't mean you need to get canceled
for saying it if it's funny it's funny
if you didn't want to see like things
like that you would not be on locals and
so you wouldn't have to be exposed to
it so I'm going to put out this uh this
uh offer to you if you're not on locals
and you're having a problem with
loneliness I did not plan it this way
but you know how products evolve on
their own um apparently the biggest
benefit people get is that they're
meeting the other people online uh they
have relationships
in the morning when I do the pre-show
before I do the Regular Show I just do a
handheld phone situation as I'm getting
ready for the show petting my dog and
doing some fun stuff um mostly they just
don't even pay attention to me it's just
all the people checking in with their
favorite people that they see every
morning same ones every morning so
they're about um 500 people check in in
the morning who all got to know each
other and um I think they would all say
that it makes them feel less lonely
should it should so loneliness is a
gigantic problem I can't solve it
completely but if you want an if you
want a uh a digital friend and you want
500 extra digital friends or over 11,000
people on locals subscription for just
just my community so there's plenty of
people there they're not all there for
the same reason some of them there are
just want to see the comments
see the see the memes but a whole bunch
of them are just there because they live
alone and often there a certain age and
uh we make that okay so I do an evening
program almost every night um around
dinner time California time and that one
is the one where the
lonely are most served because it's more
intimate and we don't worry about the
news we just hang out and I love it
so for me it's the same has the same
benefit so I'm never
lonely because I spend time with
hundreds of people two hours every day
and it
helps all right the dilber calendar is
available too for 2025 you can only get
it at the link at dilbert.com it's not
on Amazon it's not in the stores it will
only be at that link that you can find
at dilbert.com and
and that's all I got for now I'm going
to talk to the locals people uh
privately and the rest of you I will see
you tomorrow same time same place thanks
on X and YouTube and Rumble it's been
great to see you bye for now have a
great
weekend
