oh
hey i didn't see you there come on in
you're right on time for a coffee with
scott adams the
best part of the day every single time
and when you participated in the
simultaneous sip i think you can feel a
connection to the rest of the world
something you were missing before but
something that feels really good and all
you need is
a copper mug or a glass a tanker chalice
or stein
a canteen jugger flask a vessel lavender
guy
and fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better including the holidays
it's called the simultaneous step it
happens now go
ah success once again isn't it good to
start off with a little victory
the victory of the simultaneous sip sure
it's not the biggest accomplishment of
the day but it's not the smallest one
well let's talk talk about all the
things
there was a big explosion in nashville
allegedly some camper pulled up to a
att building and some other buildings in
may it may or may not have warned people
and then it blew up
do you know what we know about that
story
something blew up do you know what else
we know about that story
nothing pretty much nothing
something blew up we're in the fog of
war
it doesn't appear to be a traditional
terrorist
because it seems designed to not
kill people but rather either send a
message or damage a building
some people are theorizing it's because
of the att assets in there
and maybe it's because there's in some
nsa surveillance or something about the
georgia elections
i don't think any of that's true my
guess is
that should we ever figure out what
happened and why
it's going to be something you never
heard of
that's what i think because if it were
something you'd heard of
it would it would look more familiar or
somebody would be taking credit for it
if it were isis isis would be taking
credit
if it were intended to kill people they
would have done it somewhere else
so whatever this is
it's probably going to be something new
it's either an individual crazy person
or it's somebody trying to get revenge
on one
person or maybe it's
covering up some other crime but
whatever it is
it's going to be something we haven't
seen so we'll just wait and see if we
ever figure that out
there's a little fake news on fox news
site today
uh and let me tell you what their
headline sentence says
and i'll tell you why it's fake news it
says uh
that it's an article on vitamin d and in
the subtitle
to the time to the headline it says
additional studies
also revealed actually i think this
might have been in the body of it
it said additional studies also revealed
that 9 n of 10
covid19 deaths could have been prevented
if people had adequate vitamin d levels
so this is from a fox 26 report
listen to this sentence carefully all
right
because the exact words matter a lot in
this sentence
so additional studies which by the way
are not linked
to so it's an article which makes a
claim
that's based on studies
doesn't link to them okay that's your
first red flag right
and it says revealed that nine out of
ten covet deaths
could have been prevented could have
been so it's softened by
could have been if people had adequate
vitamin d levels how do you read that
the way i think you read it is that if
you took vitamin d
supplements and got your vitamin d
levels up enough that you would have no
risk of
coven 19 death anyway you'd have risk of
the virus
not death isn't that what it seems to be
saying
but let me tell you a different
interpretation and then i'll read the
sentence again and see if you can see it
the other interpretation is that people
who happen to have low vitamin d
because they're sick or old
which is why you have low vitamin d so
one of the main reasons you would have
low vitamin d is that you're ill
from some other thing now if you're ill
from some other thing to the
degree that your vitamin d levels are
low
or or maybe that's just a coincidence
that comes with those other things
all vitamin d would be as an indicator
it wouldn't be a cause of anything or
the lack of it wouldn't be a cause of
anything
it would just be an indicator that
somebody has low
health so if people had adequate vitamin
d levels
they could avoid hospitalization is
almost certainly a true statement
but misleading if they had vitamin d
levels that were good they wouldn't have
comorbidities or at least as many
comorbidities or the
the type that would lower your vitamin d
so all it's telling you is they have
a health problem probably now there was
one study in spain with 76 patients and
i think that was a little complicated by
the fact that they were also taking
hydroxychloroquine according to the
study
so one study 76 patients
doesn't tell you enough um i still think
that vitamin d
is likely to be important in other words
i think the fake story
is likely to be true by coincidence
or or unrelated to why they think it's
true it might be true anyway
but the claim that they're making is
just complete bs
the the there's a correlation that they
found they have not found
a causation but that said i feel like
there's a good enough chance there's a
causation too
that i take vitamin d i would recommend
it i think you should just for good
you know it's good for you anyway so
there's no downside if you don't take
too much
um somebody asked me why the dilbert
comic
doesn't have any non-white people
is that a good question in 2020 seems
like a good question right
hey scott what is your
dilbert comic in in 2020 when the world
is
far you know is completely diverse
why don't you have more white uh
non-white people in your comic well now
there's one
i shook the intern as indian indian
american
but the criticism is still valid
and let me explain why there's a
obvious functional reason that there
can't be
and it goes like this in the united
states
in 2020 and this has been true my whole
career but it's true today
in 2020 you can't have an entertainment
vehicle in which a white creator makes
fun of
people who are not white that's not a
thing
do you think i could make a comic where
i made fun of people who were
anything except people like me no
nobody can make that comic there's no
such thing as a white person who's
mocking
black people or hispanic people or
anybody else
in an entertainment forum and getting
away with it
you can't do that so if somebody's
asking me
why don't i have diversity in the comic
i would love to
i'd love to i would love that the
dilbert comic would more closely
you know look like the actual republic
i'm
i'm completely i'm completely on board
with the fact that
there should not be a comic strip with a
cast of characters
that are almost entirely white do you
think i like that
why would i why would i like that i'm
intentionally trying to make the comic
look like real life
and that doesn't look anything like real
life not even close
so of course i would like them to be
diverse
but i don't have that option i don't
have that option
the dilbert comic would disappear one
day after i put some
uh other characters in there now i know
what what people were not cartoonists
are saying
scott you you i think you're being a
little
you know maybe too sensitive or too
cautious
you other movies do it tv shows do it
other people do it no they don't
no they don't they don't do it you might
think they do
but you won't find it give me an example
you can't find it there's no movie
written by
white people with let's say a white
director and a white
writer mocking people of other
ethnicities
unless they also had a writer
who might represent those other groups
they're probably not
doing it right
somebody's saying south park so i would
say south park would be
the exception that proves the rule
so here's what you can do if you're the
exception that proves the rule
if you create a property that bias
design
is the thing that makes fun of
everything you're not supposed to make
fun of
well then you can do it yeah so south
park is by its design
the thing that makes fun of everything
and it especially makes fun of all the
things you're not supposed to make fun
of
if i made that property which is not
what dilbert is dilbert's about the
workplace and blah blah
but if i made that property i could do
that too i would say
family guy was a little bit like that
although i think you couldn't write most
of the family guy
stuff in 2020. i don't know for sure but
i'll bet
one of the reasons that that family guy
isn't as big a deal is because you just
can't do the same jokes that you used to
be able to do
but again if your property is about that
then then you can do it sure but you
have to be about that
to get away with it
um jerry seinfeld
i don't think that's an example of what
you're trying to say
all right so yeah even in in the
simpsons they had to
get rid of their apu the the 711
guy so
that's enough about that um have you
noticed that i have not
waited in on the big controversy
of how many genders there are
have you noticed it's sort of
conspicuous you know i talk about pretty
much most of the headlines
but i i stay away from that topic
completely now there are two reasons for
that one
i'm very pro lgbtq and
all all people being whatever they want
to be
right so i'm completely on board with
human beings
being human beings i don't know how you
could be against that
right and i don't require that they all
be like me
i require that they not hurt me all
right i would really like them to be on
my team
but i don't require them to be like me
that's crazy
so here's my only thing i'll say about
the whole how many genders are there
if you if you and i agree
that there is such a thing as a person
doesn't matter who we're talking about
it
just let's say there is a person who has
who is born with
male genital parts but considers
themselves
since they were a kid and all through
adulthood considers themselves
female mentally and let's say
emotionally
if we both agree that that person exists
and clearly they do
you know likewise there are people born
with female
parts that in their mind
they have felt male all their life if we
believe that they exist
and that i just describe them accurately
we're done we're done
somebody's saying it's a mental disorder
is it
isn't it only a mental disorder if it's
a problem
right if it's not a problem i don't know
how it's a mental disorder that is just
a difference
a difference without a problem is just a
mental dis
is a just a difference so
where is the source of this mental
problem if you say it's a mental problem
because those people
don't fit well into the mechanisms of
society
i would say well maybe that's a problem
with the mechanisms of society
maybe it's a problem that we don't have
private bathrooms in public places
maybe it's not a problem with the person
being different because we're all
different in different ways
so that's pretty much my entire opinion
on the topic
if you are if you're arguing about the
words
about whether somebody is a male or they
really are
a woman that's not a real argument
if we can describe exactly what they are
what what difference does the label mean
that that's just not a real argument now
there are real arguments about what you
do in a practical
sense there are lots of practical
decisions that you have to make yeah
about kids in schools and bathrooms and
stuff
so a lot of it is just a practical
decision based on what resources you
have and
how far you can go to accommodate
individuals those are all good arguments
but to simply label it a mental illness
when it's a difference
i feel that doesn't add anything and
it's not helpful
uh james hamlin tweets that uh there's a
dangerous trend of
reporting when somebody gets the virus
vaccination if they have any kind of
reaction to it like an allergic reaction
it becomes a national story now what
happens
when the rarest of possibilities which
is an adverse reaction to the vaccine
rare rare rare what happens when the
news
focuses on the rare what makes you think
the vaccine's pretty dangerous because
the only stories you see
are are about problems so i had
predicted that this would happen
it is guaranteed that there will be both
reactions in some people because there
always are to vaccines
but also there will be times when people
have coincidental problems immediately
after the
vaccination because there are people who
get suddenly sick
all the time for lots of different
reasons some of those people
are going to get suddenly sick or even
suddenly die
right after they got a vaccination it's
going to be national news
you should ignore all of it
um i'm starting to soften up a little
bit on an opinion
i had uh recently about uh the
republicans and about trump
looking to uh to kill this
defense spending bill the 740 billion
whatever it is
and trump was tweeting today that he
doesn't like it because it's a gift to
china russia and big tech if he says it
fails to terminate the
section 230 that's internationally
dangerous
he said that won't allow us to bring our
troops back home where they belong it
renames and destroys forts and national
monuments
and makes 5g almost impossible
and i said what
what are you telling me that somewhere
buried in this defense bill and we all
know that there's a whole bunch of
you know stuff random stuff buried there
but are you telling me there's something
in that bill
and i don't know if it's true or if it's
hyperbole or what
but seriously there's something in the
bill
that would make 5g almost impossible
fact-check that for me will you if
there's something in the bill
that would make 5g almost impossible
that's the end of the story
you get that right if that claim is true
and i don't know i mean it's a political
claim so i'm not going to say it's true
just because i
saw it in a tweet but if it's true
if it's true oh yeah we have to kill
that bill
there's no doubt about it because 5g
is so critical to the future
of our economy uh of our security
of everything if that's really there
there's no doubt about it that it has to
be vetoed
so if it's true that the republicans
were on to this and they
you know they said that they have other
reasons they want to veto it
but if this is one of them
i'm on board with the veto now i've said
that
you uh it's crazy stupid
to veto cash to people who need it it
puts a boot on the poorest people in the
country
you do it on christmas it's just wrong
it's wrong on so many levels
to get to this point and then even have
to you know
uh try to beat this thing at the last
minute
but under this under the uh
condition that is true and i need a fact
check on this but if it's true
that this is making 5g almost impossible
you do have to hurt the poor to kill it
that's an adult decision and it's awful
it's complete incompetence maybe evil
that we're even in a position where we
have to make that kind of a decision
but here we are right unfortunately we
can't go back in time here we are
if we have to make the decision of
putting our boot
on the neck of poor people or
disadvantaged people in this country
just about the worst thing you could
think of doing
but the alternative is this 5g
thing the 5g thing is so big
that it would also put a boot on the
people in
the bad situation it would just do it
later so
i do think that at some point some
politicians somewhere
had to draw the line and say all right
we just have to stop
doing stuff like this putting a bunch of
bad stuff
with the good stuff so it gets through
and
maybe this is the place you know so this
is the part where i'm softening
because i said it was literally the
worst time
to take a stand maybe it's the only time
you can do it
maybe it's the only time you get enough
attention is when it's the worst
time but maybe it just had to be done
eventually whether it was
on this or something else so i'm
i'd say i'm a little bit uh moved by the
argument
that the republicans may have a better
uh ethical and moral case than my first
reading
indicated and by the way this is for
those of you who say
scott you never change your mind based
on
on any new facts but you're watching it
i mean you're watching me change my mind
in real time based on
facts so next time you tell me i don't
do that remember this
so i thought the news would be kind of
quiet so i decided to cause some trouble
myself
uh i'm not proud of that but
something i do so
i tweeted that uh i'm really tired of
seeing this word narcissism used in
politics
but i also think it's bs
uh in scientific terms as well
and with your indulgence i would like to
talk about the bs
which is narcissism and the the
psychology
industry in general so i'd like to
debunk them a little bit and here's how
i started with this tweet
which i knew would draw fire and it was
drawing fire that i kind of wanted
i wanted to see what the argument was so
i said narcissism is a
junk science idea that comes from people
with low self-esteem who want to believe
people with strong self-esteem
are the defective ones so this does that
sound provocative enough yet
he goes that's why there seems to be a
so-called epidemic of narcissism going
on
so it turns out there is actually an
epidemic of narcissism
that's a real thing so the psychologists
have believed that this is a real thing
this narcissism
but now it's way worse so suddenly
in just the last i don't know i don't
know what years we're talking about
let's say 10 years
i think in the last 10 years the amount
of diagnosed or supposed
narcissism in this country and maybe the
world but this country
has gone from like you know one to 15
you know it's like one percent to 15 of
the population
it's like there's narcissism everywhere
it's it's an outbreak of narcissism
now that's your first red flag right
isn't it a red flag because it wasn't
that much maybe that changed in society
but suddenly there are way more
narcissists
doesn't it feel like this is an observer
problem
that's what i think it is here's what i
mean by an observer problem
an observer simply believes that
something
has happened happening and it isn't so
there's no problem with the thing
they're observing
the thing they're observing is just fine
it's it's a problem with the observer
who believes there's
some big problem let me give you another
example when people call other people
racists what's wrong with that
well there's a there's an embedded
assumption when you call somebody a
racist
most the time the embedded assumption is
that the person who's doing the accusing
isn't a racist right i mean why would
you
be a racist and then accuse somebody of
being a racist
like that wouldn't make any sense so
you know accept some weird situation
but people who believe that you're a
racist
are under the impression that they're
not
and here's the problem you cannot be
that's not one of the options it's just
not one of the options
because i've said this before your brain
is a pattern recognition machine you
can't turn that off
there's no button on your brain that
says turn off pattern recognition
can't be done nobody's wise enough smart
enough
and if you could turn it off well you'd
be dead pretty quickly
because pattern recognition is the basic
operating system of your brain it's just
not very good
it is your operating system it's just
it's buggy
so the way that you get bias and racism
and all the problems that come with that
pattern recognition
is because we're all bad at it it's not
like you're bad at it and i'm good at it
you're bad at it and i'm bad at it
because we're humans if you're a human
you're bad at pattern recognition
that's built in sometimes you're right
and that's what fools you into thinking
you're right on the other times
but you're all bad at pattern
recognition i'm bad you're bad all right
so if you're a racist and you're
accusing somebody else of being a racist
you're just being bad at pattern
recognition because
you are one too maybe in little
different ways maybe you don't say
things out loud
maybe you think them but you are
okay so that's an observer problem the
problem
is not that there is a person who is a
racist or not the problem is that the
observer
imagines a world where there exists
racist
and here's the imaginary part non-racist
they're just people who are racist about
different things in different ways
that's about it
all right but that said
while i believe that we're biologically
inclined to racism if you want to be a
good person
in the world you will do what you can to
use your higher
sense of reason to tamp down whatever
natural
impulses you have from your bad pattern
recognition
so we would all like to try to overcome
our pattern recognition but it's not
really a thing you can't really overcome
it
all right
let's talk about some of the definitions
of
narcissism so scott barry kaufman who's
a
humanistic psychologist came in to
mock me on twitter for my thought that
narcissism is not real and he said
narcissism and healthy self-esteem are
very different from each other
all right number one when somebody like
me
makes a tweet like this where i say
narcissism is a junk science idea
that comes from people with low
self-esteem who want to be
believe people with strong self-esteem
are the defective ones
did you read that as being literally
exactly covering everything when you
read a tweet
about a big topic do you think the tweet
is intended to be complete
that's not really how tweets work tweets
are over simplifications
all right it's an oversimplification
with the purpose of being provocative
and the fact that i oversimplified it
intentionally
is what causes the provocative part
right so scott barry kaufman's first
comment is just sort of
i don't know low reading comprehension
if he thinks that the only thing i think
is that having a
a healthy self-esteem is the same as
narcissism because i don't think that
i'll tell you what i do think as we go
on here but no
he's misinterpreting it because he
thinks it's a literal
complete statement which you don't do on
twitter
and then he says also i love it when
non-scientists dismiss an entire area of
study as
junk science okay then we'll stop
doing the science and just defer to your
wisdom
because you know everything so this was
what he tweeted back to me
while defending that narcissism is a
real thing
and i thought to myself i feel as if
one of the symptoms of narcissism is
everything in this tweet
do you notice the first problem i'm the
observer now
right as the observer i'm going to look
at this statement by scott barry kaufman
a man i've never met
never been in the same room but as an
observer
i observe the symptoms of narcissism
clearly in this tweet
so is he a narcissist because i have
observed the symptoms
let's go on so he thinks
uh well so
let's uh let's give you the quiz let's
find out if you are
a narcissist take the quiz with me i'll
tell you what the symptoms are
now you keep track of how many of these
symptoms you have
and i'll do the same all right this is
from the mayo clinic
it says a narcissistic personality
disorder
and some people on twitter wanted me to
know that there's a difference between
calling somebody a narcissist on twitter
which is sort of a
general insult versus the real clinical
narcissistic personality disorder
and so some people were willing to dis
to agree with me
so far as yeah we overuse the word
but at the same time we overuse the word
it can be true
that there's a legitimate clinical
diagnosis it's a real thing
to which i say nope it's not a real
thing in the clinic either
now i might be right i might be wrong
but my claim is it doesn't exist in the
clinic doesn't exist in science
it doesn't exist anywhere it's
just a completely made-up thing that has
no
use no function no nothing
it's just an empty empty idea all right
so
let's see what the mayo clinic says
about it
it says narcissistic personality
disorder
blah blah blah is a mental condition
what what is not a mental condition so
everything your brain does is sort of a
mental condition
okay in which people have an inflated
sense of their own importance
do you see the problem already people
have an
inflated sense of their own importance
according to the observer
do you see it yet it's an observer
problem
if you tell me i have an inflated sense
of my own importance
why the are you the one that was
right
why can't i be right why isn't my
inflated sense of my own importance
perfectly accurate
who are you to tell me that my
importance is less
than my own belief of my importance i
might be right
i might be wrong but why are you
more right than i am about my importance
do you see it yet now keep we'll keep
going and you're going to see this
observer problem over and over again
right
it says this is also from the mayo
clinic
says that you have a deep need for
excessive attention
and admiration who says it's excessive
you're observing me right now live
streaming to the world
in front of two major platforms because
why am i live streaming and you're
watching
well i'm live streaming and you're
watching because i believe
that what i'm producing is worth
worthy of being watched okay
but if i believe that the thing i'm
doing is worthy of
to use the mayo clinic's words it's
worthy of attention
and well i wouldn't say admiration
that's kind of mind reading isn't it if
somebody said that
because i'm doing this i clearly i
clearly am chasing attention all the
time i do it in public
you know most of what i do is to get
attention
and i don't do it transfer i don't do it
in any opaque way i do it transparently
i'm transparently trying to get lots of
attention because i like it
because it has a value it's a value i
think to you
it would definitely be a value to me so
who gets to tell me that was excessive
is my
need for attention excessive
well the observer says so maybe
but why is the observer right
why can't the observer be somewhat of a
mind reader in this case
because what makes it excessive if it
works and it has a function and it's
part of a strategy and a plan
it's part of my business model
who says it's excessive that's an
opinion all right let's go on
another another sign of narcissist is
that they have troubled relationships
what troubled relationships
can you name anybody who doesn't have
troubled relationships
do you notice what's going on now now
they're just throwing some bs on the
pile
because there's nobody who doesn't have
troubled relationships
in fact every mental condition in the
world
causes troubled relationships
all right let's go on uh how about a
lack of empathy for others
uh let me let me measure all of your
empathy now
um okay uh see
i'm seeing uh brian with a with a y
i'm looking into your mind now yeah
not much empathy in there brian i'm
sorry about you let me do another one
um havoc user havoc i'm
reading your empathy oh you're good
actually you have lots of empathy um
now do somebody else um okay
uh joe i'm reading your mind now
no i'm sorry you don't have
not enough empathy in there you see the
problem again
it's an observer problem how the hell do
i know how much empathy you have
moreover how many different conditions
create a lack of empathy according to
other people
all of them if you're an alcoholic do
you exhibit a lack of empathy for other
people
yes if you're on this spectrum do you
exhibit a lack of empathy for other
people
yes if you're a ceo do you exhibit a
lack of empathy for your employees
i hope so because if you don't you'd be
a bad ceo
you have to do things that are bad to
them
to run the business hoping there's a
greater good that
helps everybody in the long run as
capitalism does
all right so imagining that you can see
someone else's amount of empathy is
mind-reading
it's frankly crazy and i don't know how
you could be a professional
and think you could determine someone
else's
degree of empathy or if it's the right
amount
that's purely an observer problem
they've compared your empathy
to their own right that's exactly what
happened
they imagined how much empathy they had
and they said well that's the normal
amount
then they read your mind because they
can't possibly know how much empathy you
have
and they've determined ah yeah
compared to mine you're you don't have
enough
so therefore you have a mental disorder
it's crazy
it's absolutely crazy that we put up
with this kind of
bogus science all right how about this
uh that behind their these are
definition of a narcissist again if
you're just joining me
uh behind their mask of extreme
confidence
lies a fragile self-esteem that's
vulnerable to the slightest
criticism so
do you know anybody who is vulnerable to
the slightest
criticism you know there's a there's a
category of people
that i don't know if you met any of
these uh and i don't know if this is
actually a psychological designation or
what
but there's an entire category of people
and there are a lot of them
who are almost to a person in that group
quite vulnerable to the slightest
criticism
they're called women has have you heard
of them
they're they're everywhere if you go
outside uh that's
pretty much half of everybody in the
world is a woman
have you ever met a woman who is not
vulnerable to the slightest criticism
criticism no you haven't
no you haven't you've never met a woman
who was who was invulnerable to
criticism
even slave ones now is that because
women
are weak and can't take criticism
well there's another group of people and
there are a lot of them
who are very cr they're kind of
sensitive
to criticism they're not women it's
another group
and they don't like it when they get
criticized and it bugs them
do you know what they're called men
men have you ever met a man that liked
criticism i get a lot of it
i don't like it but i find i'm
you know you get used to it and then you
you can just
deal with it easily so i would say that
dealing with criticism
has more to do with practice i've simply
had more practice dealing with criticism
than other people so it probably bothers
me less
is it because i'm awesome is it because
i'm the only person here who doesn't
have a mental problem
and the rest of you you're all bothered
by criticism more than i am
so sorry i'm the only one here who's not
a
not a narcissist all the rest of you
clearly meet the definition of being
bothered by
slight criticism wait who gets this
to decide what is a slight criticism
oh you see it again bothered by
slight criticisms
who gets to decide how big the criticism
is
the observer that's right the observer
gets to decide that oh that was a slight
criticism
would the observer think the same thing
if they had been on the other end of
that
slight criticism there's nobody who
doesn't get bothered by criticism it's
built into us
now i know you're going to say it's a
matter of degree and then i'm going to
say well that's a matter of opinion
the degree is kind of an opinion um how
about this
um
uh let's see narcissist uh
you have problems with uh your
relationships
problems at work school and in your
financial affairs
does that describe anybody else you just
described almost everybody i know
there are very few people who don't have
problems in their life problems in their
relationships
problems that work problems at school
problems in their financial it's pretty
much everybody
and it's for all different reasons right
every kind of mental problem can cause
all these same problems
so let's see what else uh
p and this is also from mayo clinic says
people with narcissistic personality
disorder
may be generally unhappy and
disappointed
when they're not given the special
favors or admiration
they believe they deserve they believe
they deserve
how do you know they believe how do you
know what they believe they deserve
are you a mind reader
all right if you if you asked
somebody that you thought was a
narcissist who had entered a contest
and lost to somebody who was just better
at the contest let's say they hit the
target more
do you think the narcissist would say no
i'm i'm the best one here i just lose
all the contests
i mean i don't know what that would be
but
um anyway so it's all the observer
effect
and they may find their relationships
unfulfilling
that's like everybody all right so
here's a here's another
list from somebody else now the other
problem with this narcissistic stuff
is that you can find different lists all
over the place
and if you can't even define it with one
definition
you know it's made up right you know
it's not a real thing
if everybody's got a little bit
different definition of it that's that's
a big red flag
so here's some more they exaggerate
their achievements and talents
you're a narcissist or this is one side
of it
if you if you exaggerate your
achievements and talents
do you know who else exaggerates their
achievements
and talents everybody with a job
also everybody dating if they're doing
it right
exaggerating your accomplishments is
what your co-workers do
to get a raise i exaggerate my
compliment my
accomplishments when i'm in the context
of you know
the corporation and people don't know
what my accomplishments are
now in my current role i don't feel
necessarily that i need to exaggerate my
accomplishments because i do things
publicly
so if i accomplish anything people are
going to notice because it's public
but is that a flaw
whose idea is it that it's a flaw to
exaggerate your achievements and talents
because it feels like to me like that
would more often be good
than bad in other words you would get a
good outcome
from exaggerating your achievements and
talents
when i decided to become a cartoonist
with zero experience in cartooning
was i even in my own mind exaggerating
my talents of course i was
to good effect i exaggerated in my own
mind
i had over confidence for something i
had no experience in
and had no reason to believe that i
should succeed in it
but it was a really useful fiction
so it's a useful fiction to tell
yourself you can do things
that you don't know if you can do but
it's useful fiction
so i would say that's a healthy person
here's some more their master
manipulators
says who says who have you ever been in
a
bad relationship where you were not
called a manipulator
is that even possible has anybody ever
been in any kind of a
bad relationship say the end of a
marriage or whatever
where you were not accused of you were
accusing each other probably of
manipulating each other
so manipulating people is so universal
it's what addicts do it's what your boss
does your co-workers your lovers
it's kind of universal people
manipulating each other
so if it's generic and universal
what's it doing in this definition how
about they don't recognize or accept
your feelings
how in the world do you know somebody
doesn't recognize
or accept your feelings i don't feel
like that's even a thing
really it's mind reading it's the
observer problem
if the observer can't determine that you
have accepted their feelings
they say you haven't accepted their
feelings but they can't read your mind
they don't know what you're accepting or
not accepting
who doesn't accept feelings if you
observe somebody has feelings
you're done i observe you have a feeling
i might not think you should have that
feeling but
i don't feel like the there's anything
here it's like an empty
statement right yeah everybody
anyway they are arrogant
if arrogant is one of the uh
the things that says you're a narcissist
that would be
everyone on twitter because i don't see
anybody on twitter
who doesn't act arrogant are they all
narcissists
again it's one of these these universal
things if you put me in a certain topic
i might act
arrogant because i think i know
something about that topic
if you just move me to another topic
where i don't know anything
and i don't have any you know instinct
about it
i don't think you know i don't look
arrogant in that case so really it's
just about what context you're in
and the observer problem how about this
they require constant admiration and
adoration
and need to be the center of attention
well that describes me
doesn't it describe you how many of you
would say
i i like admiration is there somebody
here who doesn't want to be admired
is there anybody here who doesn't like
to be adored
i mean if you had a preference if you
could choose to be ignored and reviled
or admired and adored
shouldn't you pick the admired and
adored one how is that how's that the
mental illness
i would think that wanting to be admired
and adored
is a sign of excellent mental health
but it's literally on the list of mental
illness
the thing that i would strive for
does it hurt you that i uh
i'll use the word require but that's
mind reading i don't require it
i prefer it can can a psychologist tell
me if i require
a constant admiration and adoration or
do i just
prefer it so i work toward an end in
which i've done something good enough
for the world in which the natural
outcome of that would be i would guess
some
you know people would like me for it or
something what's wrong with that
shouldn't i want to be that person who's
working hard to make something so good
in the world that i'll be admired
you want to turn that off i think you
want to turn that up
you don't want to turn that down let's
have more of that
you know if everybody in the world were
working hard to be admired
i think we'd have a better world it's
not worse
all right how about this they take
advantage of others
who doesn't do that they take advantage
of others
it's a matter of degree right everybody
works it lives in a world in which
somebody else's actions
affect you and so you want to influence
their actions so their actions affect
you in the best possible way
isn't that everybody that's literally
everybody that's everybody all the time
but if you word it as taking advantage
suddenly it sounds like a mental illness
how about a reword
taking advantage of others into
uh you're a social person
that's the same thing if you live in a
social situation and you're a social
person
you are taking advantage of others and
they are sometimes taking advantage of
you
and when you sum it all up together it
works really well
it's an opinion from the observer that
somebody has taken advantage of someone
now obviously if there's you know if
it's abusive that's something else
they believe they are superior do they
do you think that you could find anybody
who has been diagnosed
by an actual psychologist let's say a
psychiatrist let's say the highest level
of training
and they diagnose somebody as a
narcissist
and then do you think that if i went and
talked to that narcissist
privately and i said hey narcissist do
you believe you are superior to other
people
do you think that narcissist would say
yeah you know
i i do i do think i'm superior to other
people
now suppose they did say that here's my
follow-up
question well do you believe that you
could play basketball
better than an nba player
what would they say would the narcissist
say yeah as a matter of fact i've never
played basketball
but i could play better than michael
jordan
would they no they wouldn't they'd say
i wouldn't be good at basketball for a
variety of reasons
i might be good at some other things but
if you said
to them uh and uh let's let's hear
you're singing
are you the best singer in the world
you're superior to everybody in your
singing would the narcissist say yeah
you know i've never sang
but i'm pretty sure i would be no they
wouldn't
they wouldn't there's literally no one
in the whole planet who meets this
definition and they believe they are
superior
they're only people who believe they're
good at some things that's it
there's nobody who believes they're
better at everybody and everything
and if they were narcissism wouldn't be
the problem they would just be flat out
you know
super crazy and then it gets into weird
stuff
about where they come up with the reason
that you're this narcissist
this is where it gets really bad
crazy all right
here are the here are the official
reasons
that you might be a narcissist okay so
it's not fully understood how a person
becomes a narcissist
duh if it's not fully understood
that's another red flag right
but the claim is that they have these
common background influences
so that maybe that's not a coincidence
and they say that that common influence
is usually a parent
who gives them excessive pampering or
excessive
criticism in childhood years
or they might come from a broken home
etc to me that all looks like false
correlation because i imagine there are
lots of things that are correlated
that's all i see there or they didn't
have they substituted
lack of love and support from a parent
by over
emphasizing their own worth none of that
sounds real
it doesn't even sound a little bit real
it's just it sounds like stoned people
talking
there is so little science in this that
is laughable
now let me let me summarize this way
my claim is that narcissism as a
diagnosis
is a made-up useless
grab bag of a word with no
no functional purpose and i'm gonna i'm
gonna prove it
by doing the same thing okay
and i'm going to invent a mental illness
called
adam's disease now i want us
i want you to see if you have a bad case
of adam's disease i'm going to list the
symptoms
now you don't have to have all of the
symptoms
in order to say you have the disease if
you had say four out of five
or even three out of five you'd probably
still be suffering from
adam's mental disease so see if you have
these symptoms
are you obsessed with showing your
knowledge to other people
are you obsessed with showing your
knowledge to other people
for example at work if you have some
knowledge
and it's needed for your business do you
present your knowledge to other people
i'll bet you do about you do if you get
an argument with your
spouse or lover and there's a fact
that is important to the conversation do
you bring it up
i'll bet you do i'll bet you're obsessed
with facts
do you know why i say you're obsessed
it's the observer problem
you might say uh i use facts because
facts are kind of important for thinking
and i do display
my knowledge because everybody does
sure but i think
i think you're obsessed with it i think
that you have an unhealthy obsession
with showing your knowledge and how do i
prove that
because compared to me compared to me
because i defined myself as normal but
you look a little obsessed without
showing your knowledge thing sure we do
the same thing
i show my knowledge to people you show
your knowledge to people and about the
same amount
but i feel like i just do it when it's
necessary
but you do it because you're obsessed
you know why because i could read your
mind
oh i'm reading your mind yeah you're
obsessed by it i just do it
but you're obsessed how about this
symptom number two you don't get you
don't always
sleep well is there anybody here who has
ever had
trouble sleeping yeah that is one good
sign of
adam's disease how about this
uh do you often think that you are right
and that
others are wrong has that ever happened
to you do you ever feel that you're
right
on a topic and somebody else is wrong if
you do
that doesn't seem healthy to me that
feels like a symptoms of
adam's mental illness how about this
do you sometimes think you have skills
that other people don't have
maybe because they've never tried to do
those things
do you think that yeah it's a little
sketchy isn't it that you think you have
some skills
that other people have less of those
skills a little bit arrogant
a little bit arrogant yeah i don't think
that's good mental health
do you ever pursue your self-interest
even at the expense of others
do you do you pursue your self-interest
at the expense of other people like you
don't even care about them
for example have you ever accepted a
promotion at work
because if you have i feel like you put
yourself above
all the other co-workers oh you're so
special
that you would accept a promotion given
to you by your boss
because why because why you think you're
special
if you didn't think you especially you'd
say hey boss
i maybe other people are more qualified
maybe maybe someone else should have it
because if you get that promotion
no one else can get it you are being
purely selfish
if you get that promotion because
there's only one
if you get it somebody else didn't get
it why do you think you deserve it
you you suffer of adam's
mental illness how about this
do you do you accept my feelings or do
you not accept my feelings
i don't think you accept my feelings and
i feel that that's a sign of mental
illness on your part
why can't you accept my feelings i'll
give you an example
i feel that you should sell all of your
possessions
and then take the money that you got
from it and give it to me
what what
i i fee oh i feel like you're attacking
me now
hold on all i said was you should sell
all your possessions
take the money that you get from them
and give it all to me and i don't feel
like you're valuing my
feelings here because i really really
feel strongly about this
and you're acting like that doesn't even
matter to you
that's mental illness
isn't it as the observer don't i get to
say that your reaction to things
is is inappropriate because i after all
i'm the psychologist
so i get to decide that your your
behavior is abnormal and mine is not
so there's my example you could take
any grab bag of symptoms put a name on
it
and say if you have four of these
six symptoms you've gotta you've got a
mental illness
and most of the world will have four of
those six symptoms
as long as you're the one who gets to
decide how weird it is
that's it all right so
[Applause]
um are there people who literally
fit the clinical definition of
narcissism
and they're so bad that they actually
think they're better from other than
other people and
literally believe that other people
don't matter i doubt it
i doubt it
somebody says wow overexplained you know
the
the difficulty with that any kind of a
public
anything is that everybody has a
different appetite for
well everything really so it is not
possible to make you all happy with a
live stream but because i have a bad
case of
adam's mental illness i'm still okay
with the fact
that some of you like this and some of
you do not
i don't think that's normal
all right oh well some of you are
enjoying this so
uh some of you say i'm beating a dead
horse and some are enjoying
which is pretty much same as everything
all right that's all for now let's go
forth and have a good day and we'll talk
about that later
see you later all right
all of you on uh
somebody's telling me that adam schiff
was arrested that can't be true
i'm gonna say that that doesn't sound
like a real story
all right uh all right that's all for
now i'll talk to you tomorrow
