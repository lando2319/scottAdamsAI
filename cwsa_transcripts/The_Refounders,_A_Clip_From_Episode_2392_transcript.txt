all right um how many of you think it's
obvious that the combination of aake and
Trump is a little bit magical it's a
little bit
magical do you know what else is magical
if you throw Elon Musk into the
mix now who do these three people remind
you of Elon Musk V
Swami Donald
Trump tell you what they remind me of
Elon Musk reminds me of Ben Franklin V
reminds me of Thomas
Jefferson and Trump reminds me of George
Washington you see it right George
Washington fought the impossible fight
despite incredible physical risk Trump
impossible
odds physical risk and also Financial
ruin as a risk
that is some serious George Washington
Business uh the Ben Franklin comparison
to musk I think is obvious Ben Franklin
wasn't just about inventing stuff he was
so
smart that the other people who were
Founders said um we should probably
listen to this Ben Franklin guy because
look at the other stuff he's doing if he
could do that stuff maybe we should
listen to
him so the the Ben Franklin Elan musk
comparison I think is perfect and then
Thomas Jefferson was our in my opinion
the most verbally gifted of the
founders uh and also more of an
entrepreneur so he was an entrepreneur
you know made made the Louisiana
Purchase did you know a bunch of smart
things uh but especially as an author uh
and VI is just he just maps that
perfectly you
know so
here's what I
think I think that populism is a
losing
Vector because populism seems to be um
something that the bad guys can can turn
into a Bad
Thing here's a reframe I'd like to
suggest it doesn't feel like a
coincidence that that three of the most
prominent of the founders of the country
just
reincarnated now I don't I don't believe
in reincarnation in a literal
sense but in a political sense and in a
what is what is happening in the
simulation that we live in and code
reuse or something I mean it just feels
like it feels like the founder is just
re
reformed now there's a few Founders
missing and I'll bet you can fill in the
blanks there was this uh one founder
named John Adams who some said had a
very unpleasant and contener
personality but the other thing was he
was very uncompromising especially about
his Free
Speech do you know what today
is today is Independence
Day today is the day I declared my own
free
speech and I gave up my entire career to
get it today is the day February 22nd so
that's the day I said I'm just going to
say whatever I think is true and I got
let let the chips fall now I didn't get
cancelled today the cancellation took a
few days for it to work through the
system I think the 24th was the
cancellation day I asked grock because I
couldn't
remember
but today is the
anniversary today is actually inde my
Independence Day this is when I became
completely independent and when I say
independent I mean even Republicans let
me go after
that I didn't have any friends that
day but
eventually uh we could see the pattern
do you remember who canceled me
first well the one that mattered was the
Washington
Post so let's connect some
dots so I was one of the more effective
voice
uh for this thing they didn't like this
populous thing and I got cancelled by
the primarily the the influential one
was the Washington Post which is uh
rumored to be the the cia's
primary
vehicle for
propaganda does that look like a
coincidence do you know how many
Republicans canceled me since then still
zero not one
not even black Republicans black
conservatives not one now there was many
were
offended that's a different conversation
but no they said free speech they
actually asked me to tell me more about
them black Americans the men not not the
women so well actually the women too
yeah even Sunny Johnson invited me on so
yeah even even black women and black men
they generally said tell us more about
that that's exactly the right thing
that's what I hope for yeah tell us more
about that opinion because free speech
is our only answer the only way out is
Free Speech which we don't have at the
moment so the the black conservatives
saw that immediately whoa let's add some
free speech maybe we can get
somewhere subtracting Free Speech gets
you nowhere except where we are adding
Free Speech us usually works it's
usually a good play and the black
conservatives automatically went for the
smart play because what makes them black
conservatives in the first place they're
they're keyed into what
works what makes a person
successful well being able to talk about
things honestly is right at the top and
so the the black conservatives tend to
look at what works education staying at
a jail stay off drugs start a family
free speech and there it was they had a
philosophy that was
self-correcting they they saw an
anomally in me whoa what's he doing
that's not good and then they said
what's the correction to that free
speech and then they tried to apply it
invited me on a number of entities that
you know I got to
talk um however we do need a few more
Founders I would like to introduce a
term to replace
populism because populism does look like
chaos to other people if if you like
your team and the other team says
they're populist you feel like that's a
little chaotic I what's that going to
give me I don't know exactly where that
takes me with this populism but you know
what you do know you know what the
founders of the country were about don't
you so I think that populism should be
retired and I think we're in a
existential well we're Beyond the
existential threat cuz the Republic is
genuinely done but we could use a
refounding we need a
refounding you like the
founding every single person watching
this you were fans of the original
Founders or at least the concepts of
them the fact that they were slaves
slave owners is problem but you like the
idea you like the Constitution you like
the
revolution you like the founders their
Concepts you don't have to like them as
humans but you like their
Concepts and those are the concepts
which have now been largely
destroyed by The Blob you know the
intelligence
blob but just when things were the most
dark when hope
was almost
gone you look around
and you see that the founders are
reborn and that it couldn't be more
obvious the the weird part about it is
you don't have to
stretch it's no stretch to say Elon Musk
is our B in Franklin is it is that
hyperbole not even a little bit is it a
stretch to save a vake reminds you of
Thomas Jefferson not even a little bit
no is it a mistake to say that Trump
reminds you of of George Washington
taking the impossible fight impossible
odds and the personal risk which is just
insane and making it
work you see
it you see it and let me
offer that if you need somebody with a
contener unpleasant uncompromising
personality who isn't going to settle
for not having free
speech I
volunteer now we're going to need a lot
more founder
energy and let's not focus on
individuals it would be a mistake to say
that the individuals are the story it's
really the energy and I believe that the
founders energy is somehow reemerged and
I'm just puzzled by it I mean it's one
of those things that makes you think
you're really living in some kind of a
simulation CU how in the world how in
the world could we need the founders
energy so much and there they
are how is that a
coincidence yeah how is that a
coincidence so I would suggest to
you that while it looks
like it's the darkest period in American
history and in some ways you could make
that case I would like to suggest to you
that is always the darkest before the
dawn
