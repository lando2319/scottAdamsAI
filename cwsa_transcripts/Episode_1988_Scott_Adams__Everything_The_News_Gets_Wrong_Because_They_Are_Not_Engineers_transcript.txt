ta-da
good morning ladies and gentlemen and
welcome to the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
I'm pretty sure you've never enjoyed
anything as much as you're going to
enjoy the next approximately one hour
no I'm not bound by any hard guidelines
of timing no not at all I can make it as
long or as short as I want
don't make any jokes now how would you
like to take your experience up to
levels that nobody's ever seen ever
and all you need is that cover mug or a
glass of tanker Chelsea style and a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine here
today
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and add
us now go
hold it hold it hold it everybody hold
it
um
we have a request to wait somebody
wasn't quite ready
okay this is the real one first one
didn't count
go
okay I think we got everybody on board
there
we will leave
no viewer behind
we're like the Marines that way
well president President Biden was
bragging the gas is down more than a
dollar seventy from its peak
that adds up to around a hundred and
eighty dollars per month
for a typical family that's money in
your pocket not spent at the pump he
says money in your pocket yeah
um does this uh kind of analysis remind
you of anything
is there any
fictional character who might be well
known for saying this sort of thing
and might that fictional character be a
comic
and might it involve a boss with pointy
hair and might it involve a boss who
says
hey we could have wasted a million
dollars this year but we only wasted
half a million and that's money in your
pocket
that's money in your pocket I could have
done worse
so you're welcome
that literally is a Dilbert comic
not just one I'm pretty sure I've hit
that theme a few times and you know what
I'm gonna hit it again
I'll probably hit that Thief again yes
bragging about how things could have
been so much worse and therefore because
they're not worse
money into your pocket that's money in
your pocket baby
did you see those new Martin Luther King
statue
some people say that viewed from a
certain angle
it looks a little different than maybe
what the Creator hoped
I think they're suggesting it looks like
a giant
oh I can't say that on live stream
a giant
thing
but that's only from one point of view
now I I think I saw Mike cernovich tweet
asking what we do about this statue
because it turns out at the same time
the statue is going up I think it was
Politico had an article about
some researcher biographer who's come up
with a bunch of dirt on MLK
apparently MLK would not have survived
the metoo era if the allegations are
correct and so now you have an
interesting situation
what happens if the you know most uh
storied and famous leader of the black
community
turns out to be a metoo person and then
maybe a criminal of the
female part of the public and other
people too as well
that would be an interesting Battle of
uh Power wouldn't it who do you think
would win
who has more power in today's world
Black America
or
female America
I was saying female because there were
more of them right numbers
you know more than half of the world
I think or more than half the United
States
so we'll see uh but I think it's uh
uh it's optimistic to assume that that
statue will not be pulled down
now one reason it might not be pulled
down
is if it's mostly women who are
complaining
they don't have the upper body strength
so statue's safe
no I'm just joking because everybody
cares about me too not just women so I'm
just being I'm just being provocative I
don't think that statue is going to come
down nor do I think you should
but it does that it does it does raise
some interesting questions in our
complicated times
all right uh I may have told you before
but there's a phrase on Twitter that
will get you instantly blocked
and I don't care if you say it to me
or someone else if you use these words
about anybody doesn't matter if it's
about me
if you use this to explain anybody or to
talk to anybody you are instantly
blocked and here's the phrase
you're better than this
you're better than this
nope
no
I am exactly as good as whatever I'm
doing
if there's one thing I will never I'm
never going to back off from
you are what you do
you are what you do
if you do something and somebody doesn't
like it you're not better than that
you're exactly that
and you might be happy about it you
might not be apologizing at all you are
that yes I did that
that is who I am
and here's why I don't like the phrase
you're better than that
because it's emotionally manipulative
and it acts as though I should uh I
should organize my life around a
stranger's approval
why would I organize my life around the
approval of a stranger
and why does that person think they can
impose that on me and why would they be
dumb enough to say it in public
that their opinion should monitor it
should it should change my behavior
and make me a different person there I
don't think there's anything that
bothers me more than that phrase because
it's just manipulative
how many of you would agree it's just
pure manipulation and and here's the
other thing
anybody who would use that phrase
especially in public
would you want to be friends with that
person
because that tells you where their their
mentality is right
uh that's the
all right okay recommendation there
um
you know
as much as I appreciate the super
comments on YouTube I think YouTube
should get rid of them what do you think
because when you stop to read a super
comment
often it's not on the topic you're
talking about and I I feel like you know
the the law of reciprocity
when somebody does anything for you you
just automatically feel like you owe
them something we're all designed that
way so the problem with this model is
that especially if it's people I like
like sometimes they'll come from people
I I know personally and I like them
but if it's not on the same topic it's
not good for everybody else so it's like
paying twenty dollars
to go to the top of the line
now if you go to the top of the line on
the topic we're talking about
I think that's cool
you know because if you make a good
point it doesn't matter if you paid or
didn't they but if it's a different
topic that's probably not the best way
to use the Super Chat so
just keep that in mind you know it's a
the feature is there so you can use it
like there's no crime but just as a
preference I would rather you not give
me money does that is that fair I would
rather you not give me money in in that
particular way
uh but thank you let me show some
gratitude thank you because I think the
people who do it or usually have the
right you know the right thought in mind
and I appreciate that
all right the Trump organization I guess
is going to pay uh 1.6 million dollar
fine criminal fine
like the the news likes to make sure you
know it's a criminal fine
for what their CTO apparently did
now I'm having a little trouble
understanding this story
and maybe somebody who's
maybe more clued into the either the
specifics of this case or the legal
uh
structure of the world maybe maybe you
can sort this out for me so here's what
I understand
the I was a CFO I'm sorry CFO the
financial guy not the technical guy yeah
so the CFO of trump organization
I accidentally said CTO but the CFO the
financial guy
apparently was in charge of you know the
accounting and how things were were
recorded
and he
paid himself without going through uh
payroll by having the Trump organization
pay some of his expenses directly
now that's illegal because it didn't get
taxed in the way that the system
requires it now here's the problem
because because it happened
and because the CFO is an officer of the
uh of the company the company is also on
the hook because although it was one
person who seems to be involved as far
as we know just one person and the one
person was the person who does it for
the company
so it's a weird situation where
the Trump organization was a victim of a
crime
and they have to pay a penalty
for being a victim of a crime
now it's a little unclear if the Trump
organization
made or lost any money
because of the way this was handled
they should have come out about the same
you know certainly it would not have
been it would not have been a big enough
crime that the Trump and the Trump
organization
would have had any intention to do it
here's how you know there's no intention
because it wouldn't be worth it
the Trump organization would save baby
nothing
you know or maybe a little bit on some
kind of payroll related tax that you
wouldn't if it's just a straight expense
in both cases it probably got it was
written off as an expense
right
so if the company pays it in payroll
that's a write-off but if they pay it
directly
that's another but there's a little
little extra
that you pay a little extra taxes to pay
to support an employee that you don't
pay for a regular expense so there might
have been like a little benefit to the
Trump organization but given the size of
the organization
and the the tiny amount of benefit
really just the employee related taxes
for one person
there's no way
that anybody besides the benefactor
would have okayed that in other words uh
had had Trump or you know Don Jr or any
anybody who's in charge if any of them
had been presented with this option hey
how about you pay my expenses instead of
paying me I'll save a lot on taxes
you'll save a little bit
but if you get caught
it's like really bad
nobody would approve that because the
cost benefit doesn't make any sense you
would never put yourself in that
position so am I am I interpreting this
incorrectly
that the Trump organization is a victim
of a crime
that one individual in the company
committed
there were two victims one is the
taxpayers US and the other victim is the
Trump organization because there's no
way in the world they would have green
lit those activities the the risk reward
wouldn't make no sense no sense at all
right so
the the fact that this is being reported
like it's some kind of a trump-related
crime when they're literally the victim
of the crime
literally the victim of the crime I
think
there's no upside for them
all right so that's your first backwards
news of the day
so I tweeted yesterday uh you strange
little thought and I said that I think
it'd be a good standard for social
behavior to ignore anything a person
said before the age of 25.
because young people are Works in
progress that we usually improve
now this is based on a specific story in
the news that I'm not going to repeat
to be consistent I'm not going to repeat
the story because I don't think we
should be talking about what somebody
said when they were a young person right
so I don't even want to give you enough
details that you could Google it that's
how much I don't want to talk about it
but the concept I think is important
so I so you know I looked at the Tweet
today and it's like
1.9 million views
now a normal tweet of mine might get
like ten thousand or fifty thousand
views
it's got 1.9 million views
so I was like what's going on here oh
Elon Musk um commented so Elon Musk
commented uh if not perhaps you know age
30.
which makes me wonder if there was
something specific he said or did
between his ages of 25 and 30.
so I thought wow you know one one musk
comment he didn't even retweet it he
just commented and I got 1.9 million
views
okay so topic number two
I think I mentioned this yesterday Steve
Malloy he's his uh Twitter name is at
junk science
and he tweeted a uh
some statistics from the NOAA the
National Organization of
Alcoholics Anonymous
now what is the NOAA
the National Organization National
Oceanic
a is a atmospheric
Association
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
exactly that's exactly what I said
right
or something like that anyway so that
organization put out their uh
their data and it was or it was uh
interpreted two different ways
Steve Malloy says according to the
official government numbers
uh in the last eight years the trend has
been a decrease in temperature
which by the way I don't see anybody
questioning the data
in other words when Steve Malloy looks
at it and says uh you just told us that
the temperature went down for the last
eight years
and then he shows the graph
I don't believe anybody was questioning
whether he interpreted it correctly I
think it actually went down
but does that mean anything
does that tell you that climate change
is over
no no because if you look at the longer
term graph there are lots of multi-year
periods where it does go down
followed by going to a new high
followed Often by down a few years
followed by a new high now I'm not
saying that those numbers are
necessarily correct because I don't
believe anything anymore but those are
two completely different stories with
the same data
if you pick the most recent eight
do you have an argument that the most
recent a or more important than the last
ones a little bit
don't we all just assume that whatever's
happening recently is going to be more
important than what happened in the past
like yeah your brain just automatically
says well yeah it should be more
important than it went down the last
eight years while while CO2 was going up
that should mean something and then you
look at the the way the people who don't
like that story or that narrative how
they twist and turn
people actually said this proves that
our climate strategies are working
what they're actually people who are
following climate change and commenting
in public and they believe that we would
see the change you know because we've
done enough that's already lowering
okay maybe
I I guess anything's possible
but I don't think so I mean it seems
pretty unlikely to me but anyway
um
uh Elon Musk responded to that one as
well
and uh he said
so he was responding to my comments
about it that uh
that two different things were being
presented
it's
we also have the uh the eight years were
the warmest on record
but also trending down so which one do
you care about there's the warmest on
record or that is trending down you tell
me which one should I care about
which which one matters it's the warmest
in record
or it's trending down
I see a lot of neithers
or neithers
Trend both all right here's here's the
correct answer
there is one correct answer
and and there's and I won't take any
debate on this
all right
if you don't present both of them you're
not a credible person
that's the answer if you don't present
both
at the same time
don't listen to anything else they say
now I think I'm going to give Steve
Malloy a a pass because he's talking
about it in the context of the other
data right so that's fair because the
other datas are being presented so he
presented the part they left out so
that's good because that that
incorporates the whole but if anybody
tells you one of those numbers and they
leave out the other one
don't listen to anything they ever say
again that's somebody who doesn't know
how to do anything
um and by the way I don't know if Steve
Malloy is credible or not credible I
have no opinion I just know that he had
an interesting point about this
particular data
I looked at my uh
numbers for that and I had millions
millions of views on my tweet
and I thought what the hell is going on
here
oh Elon Musk responded to that one too
last night and he said it's easier to
argue that global warming is a risk
rather than a certainty but it is
foolish to roll those dice given that we
will eventually run out of fossil fuels
and have to generate energy sustainable
anyway how many of you would say that's
the best view does that
would you concur that we don't know what
the future looks like
but we do know we can't use fossil fuels
forever
is that is that a reasonable View
is anything left out
anything left out
yes
because what he's saying I believe would
be a hundred percent compatible with
everybody's view wouldn't it is there
anybody who doesn't think
let me say it without the negatives
do you all understand
that there's no doubt about it Humanity
will use different sources of energy in
the future does anybody doubt that
we're all 100 sure certain
that at some point in the future
will probably have other sources it
might be Fusion might be more you know
more standard nuclear stuff
might be something else might be
electric might be more wind who knows
but we're all sure of that right so I
would say that what Elon Musk said is
something we would all agree with right
is there anybody would disagree
with the proposition
that we're going to run out of the stuff
we use so it doesn't matter if there's
climate change or not we have to get
ready to develop new sources everybody
I'm seeing some dissenters I'll get to
you in a moment all right the dissenters
you already know it's a trick right you
know I'm tricking you you know it
yeah here's what's left out here's the
dog not barking
it's not about where things are going we
all agree that there is not infinite oil
there's nobody arguing that there is
the only thing we disagree on is the
rate of change
and he didn't mention that
the rate of change is the only topic we
disagree on how aggressively how much
how much of our taxes do you put into it
because you're trying to make it happen
fast
versus letting the free market do it do
whatever it wants right
so the question was never about whether
we knew we need new sustainable energy
everybody knew that
everybody knew we needed new ones
eventually whether it's 100 years from
now or 200 years from now you still have
to do it
but if you have to do it in 20 years
that is an entirely different
proposition than you have to do it in
300 years
you can't compare those two and to
imagine that
that that's you know you could leave
that out
looks a little bit more
a little bit more uh let's say
persuasion related than uh data related
because Elon Musk is you know has a
business that is very much in the
business of alternative energy so of
course he's he's uh he would like to do
that maybe faster than the rest of us
maybe or faster than some of us and
slower than some people would like it as
well but he does have a uh enormous
financial interest in being a little bit
quick about it because that's where his
money is is being quick about it buy a
Tesla now save the world
but he's not wrong
he's not wrong you just have to consider
that the rate is a real question do you
upend everything quickly or let it play
out that's really the decision
well this was going to happen uh you
know how the Republicans
or just people who lean right like to
say that the Democrats are all groomers
I'm sure you have not missed that story
I I tried not to talk about it because
it's just icky it's not really a topic
I don't know it's just not worthy of
talking about most of the time but
the Democrats put together a compilation
video of GOP groomers
and it's a pretty long compilation video
now of course you know they include
historical examples so they can go back
a little bit
but if you go back a little bit you find
a whole bunch of people who are
Republicans who absolutely
you know we're in that groomer category
if you will
so
do you know offhand
who does more of it
now most of the GOP examples were
individuals
who did things and got caught
and they seem like individual acts
whereas the so-called grooming that is
you know the alleged grooming I'll call
it on the on the left is Industrial
Level
right
it's not the people on the right are
saying hey there's that one groomer over
there like sometimes they talk about
Epstein or something but but mostly it's
about if you've got a teacher or or
somebody who has power yeah it's like
systemic grooming that's the complaint
so they're not really comparable
but uh if you imagine that all the
groomers are on one political side
well
maybe it will change your mind on that
I don't think anybody thought that but
but it's a pretty good play so just in
terms of persuasion I thought the Dems
did a good job
it's completely
um
let's say manipulative and propaganda
and is not based on proper context and
all that so it's not good but but it is
a well-executed persuasion
it's a pretty good metoo play not me too
uh what do you call it U2 more of a U2
than me too
all right
uh one of my guilty pleasures lately is
watching uh Jonathan Turley dunking on
Adam Schiff if you haven't caught any of
Jonathan turley's articles or tweet
threads about Adam Schiff the most
storied liar of of our day is really
good stuff
like just to watch how
uh capably
he he lays out the case Turley is great
like I I can't get enough of anything he
writes I see a tweet from his and I'm
definitely going to read that
he does good stuff
um
so he points out that uh the shift was
publicly
uh
his office was demanding all kinds of
censorship
at the same time he was lying about
stuff in public
so he was lying in public
while trying really hard to get the at
least Twitter
to suppress his critics while he was
lying in public
he was moving really hard not just like
one phone call or something but a whole
program of trying to suppress the people
who were calling him out for lying in
public
and Jenny
stop it jelly
um
it's amazing
it's just amazing
yeah
like to watch Chef operate I I think
Chef is he is turned into a National
Asset accidentally
like I think he was just the worst
person like
character-wise I've never seen anybody
in lower character than Adam Schiff but
because he's now so well known as the
signal of lying
that whenever he's whenever he gets
pushed forward to lie for the Democrats
you can say to yourself oh they sent the
liar
and whatever there's a scandal that's
not really anything
who did they send Bernstein to say it's
worse than the Watergate right so if you
see Bernstein
or you see Adam Schiff
where you see Eric swalwell
the one thing you can know is that
honest Democrats aren't willing to say
those things
or bread right bread and Clapper too
right and I mean that literally
because there are a lot of honest
Democrats
lots of them
the honest ones won't go anywhere near a
camera
when their team is presenting a lie so
they send Jeff and you know they're
they're designated Liars so it's
actually useful now to know when they're
lying because they just tell you oh by
the way this is just lying
now I'm going to disagree with you on
Ted Lou
I'm more of a Ted Lu fan than you're
going to suspect right so he and I have
had some exchanges on Twitter as well
but
he's just a partisan
he's just a partisan
he's not
like he's just pushing aside and you
know he's doing it in public and is he
right no
but is the other team right all the time
now
I just don't see him anywhere near
the the Schiff and swallow level he just
seems like a partisan
uh Gates was on Tim cast last night
somebody says that was fire
yeah I like Ted Lou I don't know I feel
like I could hang with him he just seems
like he'd be a fun guy
um I I tend to like anybody who's got a
sense of humor
just sort of you know a general
statement
all right uh Carey Lake
um is still I guess she had some
core success and uh pressing your case
so basically she just gets the chance to
press her case and two of the things
that she's claiming about the Arizona
election that she thinks were
illegitimate or that 300 000 or more
ballots did not have a proper chain of
custody
and number two over a hundred thousand
ballots with faulty signature
verification uh got through so the
Arizona law says that they must be
verified but her claim is that 100 over
a hundred thousand were not
now here's my problem
um
here's my problem
how how would a court ever act on that I
don't even see how a court would do
anything because isn't the court going
to say yeah
yep good points uh Arizona didn't do a
good job of following their own
procedures
thanks for telling me
I I think the Constitution just says
it's up to the states
I don't believe the Constitution says
the states must operate perfectly
according to you
or it doesn't count
now it would be different if there were
direct evidence of a crime
but if the only problem is that there
there was the potential for rigging
not direct evidence but just potential
for rigging what does the court do about
that
doesn't the court just say well
you know get a better State it's up to
the state if they if they didn't if the
state didn't did not give you the
transparency you wanted
maybe you should talk to the state
I
orders of full audit I know I'm I can't
see them decertifying a a governor race
at this point so yeah here's here's the
thing
if you're if you're making a strict
technical argument
then maybe you can make a case that the
court could do something on a strictly
technical argument but I don't think the
courts act that way when it comes to
elections I think the course will always
favor
stability of the system
and so the court knowing that if they
act let's say overthrowing election it
would create instability in the system I
don't think they'll Act
I think the court is going to say yeah
that looks pretty sketchy but you work
it out it's better if you work it out
than we work it out I think that's where
it's going
now that doesn't mean she shouldn't
press the case
because I love the fact that she's
highlighting
you know two vulnerabilities in her
system that probably are common to other
states and maybe everybody should be
looking into it so it's a good solid
you know patriotic thing and I think we
should all be even if you disagree with
you know her case
you should all be happy she's fighting
it this is exactly the kind of fight
that you want to maybe get some more
transparency in your system make people
a little bit more alert where the
problems are it's all good no matter how
this ends Carrie lake is fighting a good
fight so I think we're going to come out
ahead one way or another I don't think
she's going to win but I think I think
we'll come out ahead
did you see the uh the new
is it the cdcu saying it that the new
variant of the virus is more likely to
hit the vaccinated and already infected
do you believe that
it's the it's the and already infected
do you believe that there's a variant
that is more likely to infect you
if you'd already been infected with a
variant of that variant
does that
is that passing your sniff test
now the problem is that I don't see a
mechanism right there's no proposed
mechanism for why that could be the case
but with the vaccinations
there are some are people who propose a
potential mechanism
by which they could cause harm to some
people that's a well-described mechanism
but the but having a prior infection
everything we know about that says that
should make you stronger against
anything related to it or at least the
same
under no case have we ever seen correct
me if I'm wrong
but does it make sense you'd ever be
weaker weaker in that specific way
I don't know well let me ask you this
um I I sometimes go entire days without
human contact like actually none
yeah like one day this week I talked to
no people in person
except I guess I ordered something at
Starbucks and that was that was as close
as I got to human contact
now would a person like me
who can I can I can socially isolate
better than almost anybody would a
person like me be inclined to get like
booster after booster
less likely now there are other reasons
right that's not the only reason but
much less likely now suppose I have a
job
where I was going to be around people
like hordes of people all the time
would I be more likely to have been
boosted now again at my age right we're
not talking about younger people that's
a whole different calculation but at my
age
would I be more likely to be boosted if
I knew I was just to be surrounded by
possibly infected people all the time I
think so I think so I think that I would
be more likely to boost because I would
talk myself into that being a danger
so how do we know
that the people who have the most
obvious chance of getting infected
aren't the ones who quite reasonably are
more likely to be vaccinated and boosted
wouldn't you expect
that the more boosted you are the more
likely you would get infected
that's what I'd expect
but I'm not sure that that works for
natural immunity
does it feel to you like they might have
thrown in the natural immunity Park
so you wouldn't suspect it's the
vaccinations
it doesn't it feel like that's not what
they did it's like really because one of
them has a described mechanism
and the other ones never happened
that feels like a little sketchy that
they put them in the same sentence you
know
if you if you got vaccinated or or
natural immunity
I'm not buying any of that now to his
credit
do you know what fauci said about it
fauci said the data might be
okay I'm going to give him that
I I'm going to give him that he actually
said the data might be wrong because
apparently it's something that uh our
data is showing but other countries are
not buying into this analysis
right so there's something sketchy about
the whole thing either the data is wrong
or if the data is right they're lying to
us maybe by throwing in the natural
immunity people I mean to me this
screams bad data or bad analysis I don't
know I mean we could be we could be
wrong
I'll put everything in a you know in a
statistical frame not a yes or no
but certainly sketchy looking
um
all right here's where I want to get the
uh clop berts all clicking away click
click click click clap Birds
um I'm gonna say something that will
make you mistakenly believe
that I have a different opinion than I
do now the rest of you will completely
be on board and it'll be easy to
understand but the clot birds are just
binaries like love says hey sis wait
wait you said something about this you
must hate it all right
so the rest of you will be fine
it goes like this
I'm going to give you a little uh wind
up here
there's one thing that artists
add to the system that sometimes
scientists and engineers and lawyers
will miss
what is it what is it that artists will
sometimes see
that engineers and scientists
and other people don't see
now not feelings
um I mean that's true but that's not
where I'm going I'm not going for the
feelings part
I just want not nuance
no there's something really big that
artists see that other people don't even
look for in other words we're actually
actively looking for something
that nobody else looks for
oh
a little connection problem there
all right here's the answer
empty space
empty space
if if I'm going to design a let's say a
graphic art
if I'm going to design something I will
look for where I put stuff in the
picture but I'll make sure that there's
a big empty space a negative space
because that's what makes the
composition work it's the not just where
you put stuff is where you decide to not
put stuff
so I actively look for the the missing
parts I often talk about the dog not
barking
I I believe I've just trained my Brave
to look for the part that's missing
because Huber does that too if I'm
looking at a situation and I want to
find the joke
I don't say what's there
I say What's missing as well as what's
there right so I'm always actively
looking for What's missing
now
we have this big conversation about
excess mortality some say it might be
covered
some say
it might be the vaccination
what does the artist say
what if
there's a third Mass killer
and it's invisible to us
because we're focused on the other two
things the covet and the vaxx
now of course we we think there's some
disruption from the shutdowns themselves
you know there's some delayed medical
things and everything but
do all of those explanations feel like
they're capturing the amount of death
that we might be experiencing
does it feel like there might be
something else
and if there were yeah if it were
fentanyl we'd probably have noticed it
by now so that that is something else
but
but I'm gonna I'm gonna give you a
hypothesis that I don't present as you
know like a conclusion so I'm not going
to say this is for sure
I'm going to give you
a hypothesis that there's something
really big and really obvious that's
killing people maybe not instead of
vaccinations are covered but on top of
on top of so there so here's where the
clappers will get confused
it's a fact that vaccinations kill some
people
we just don't know what the percentage
is like even the people who are the most
pro-vaccination understand
that were all built differently and some
people are going to die it's like true
of a lot of medications
so there's not a question about whether
the vaccinations are adding to excess
mortality
or you know that as well as the Covenant
itself
but what if
what if there were a third Mass killer
would you know it
let me ask you the first question if if
there were something else going on would
you buy the the the first
um
assertion that we wouldn't notice
we wouldn't notice right
now here's my question what else changed
at about the same time as the
vaccinations were rolled out if it's the
only thing that really changed
then I think you know then it probably
makes perfect sense to focus on if it's
the only thing that changed
but is it is it the only thing that
changed
I don't know
did you know that stress
can cause cardiac arrest
did you all know that an increase in
stress
kills you
I mean not every person but
statistically right
uh let me take you back to 1970.
you're going to love where this is going
1970.
uh I was alive then
a young person let's say I had a
stressful day
a bunch of stress
and then I wanted to recover from the
stress what did I do to recover from the
stress
well I'd usually just sit around bored
or I'd like pick the bark off a stick
or I'd sit on a wall and wait for a car
to go by
or as as a helpful person said I'd beat
off
um I would go for a walk I'd play some
sports
right and if I did any of those things
my cortisol levels and my adrenaline
would go down
get back into a healthy mode for a while
but then later you know some stressful
thing would happen and then you know so
I'd be I'd be peaking and valleying all
day long right peaking and valleying now
one assumes
one assumes that the the
low points are where you regain your
health
imagine if you never got to relax
what if you had high stress
followed by more stress
followed by more stress and it never
stopped
all right what do you do in 2023 after a
stressful situation
so you feel stressed
what do you do I'll tell you what I do
I checked my phone
check my phone
so I'll be up in like high stress area
and I'll check my phone
and then my stress goes up a little bit
and then I got to go do something else I
can't play on my phone all day so I go
off to a stressful situation
and I stay there but now I've got a
break
I've got a break so I pick out my phone
and I look at Twitter and I'm like ah
and my stress stays the same
if I simply describe that situation to
you
and then I add on top of it something we
know for sure
one thing we know for sure is that all
change
causes stress
if you get married it's stressful if you
get divorced if you change jobs if you
get a promotion that's stressful if you
get fired it's stressful if the weather
changes it's stressful if your finances
change it's stressful if your
relationship you know everything every
change
what is a bigger change than the
pandemic in your life
for me nothing
that was it the pandemic was the biggest
stressor of my life
how many of you would agree
the biggest stressor that's not part of
your actual personal experience but you
know the the external stressor
now if you went to war that'd be worse
but in my lifetime I haven't
haven't gone to war
so I asked on Twitter I did a little you
know non-scientific poll and I said rank
your stress you know before the pandemic
compared to you know during and after
and uh 31 said it's about the same
stress level is about the same
uh 28 say it's a bit higher now than
before the pandemic and 24 say it's much
higher
much higher
uh and 17 say that's actually less
stress now the way I asked the question
was a problem and you know it's a
non-scientific poll so don't put too
much credibility into it but the way I
asked the question and I could tell from
the comments
people thought that when I said stress
that what I really meant was do you
trust the VAC the so-called vaccination
or not
and that wasn't the question so we're
we're so
um primed to see it as anti-vaxxer
pro-vax that I asked about people's
stress in general
and they answered it like I was asking
about vaccinations
which you know was a small part of the
the whole
so people can't even answer a simple
poll in 2023 without thinking it's about
vaccinations
like we're just so primed for war yes or
no conflict
so
now imagine
that we were in a period in America
where we had the lowest level of trust
in our leaders
in that at the same time we had the
biggest challenge they've ever had you
know maybe World War II was bigger but
in you know in my lifetime the pandemic
was the biggest leadership challenge so
imagine not trusting your own leaders
before the pandemic even started
and then you've got a pandemic
and then all the leaders and experts
start looking like maybe they're not on
your side so much it looks like a money
grab
and the you know the data and the fog of
War you don't trust your data how
stressful would it be
to have one of the biggest challenges at
the same time that you think the people
in charge of it are lying to you
and incompetent and maybe corrupt
I can't even imagine anything more
stressful than that you know short war
you know that let me let me be clear
the ukrainians have a lot worse all
right just put that out there we're not
comparing it to war but in terms of just
ordinary life stress I don't think it's
ever been higher
if I had told you
I'm going to take 25 of your public
and I'm gonna I'm gonna make them more
stressed than they've ever been in their
life
do you get more heart attacks
yes or no
do you get more heart attacks if I take
25 of the public and stress them beyond
what they've ever been stressed
I think so now I'm not sure if that
would necessarily have athletes falling
over do you I don't know that that would
make athletes start falling over in
bigger numbers like I kind of expect
that would affect people my age
you know not Elite athletes
but let me give you another hypothesis
do you think there's anything that Elite
athletes
imbibe that's different from what you
imbibe
probably
yeah because there you know they would
supplement they would you know maybe
maybe some would cheat
you know maybe some performance
enhancing things right
what if
there was one popular form of let's say
athletic performance enhancing thing
that a lot of people were using and
there was a bad batch
would you ever would you ever stop to
think
that there was any problem but the
vaccination is killing people
you would not you would assume it was
the vaccinations and it might be so
here's the part I have to say for the
club Birds clappers
I'm not saying that the vaccinations are
safe
I'm saying I don't know how dangerous
they are but I'm also saying that if you
assume it's the only thing that would be
killing people at the same time a lot of
things are changing
there are a lot of other things that are
changing
and I worry that it's like a magician's
trick we're watching The Magician's two
hands you're like oh watch his left hand
that's the vaccination one watch his
right hand that's the anti-vaccination
one but this guy's only got two hands so
if we watch those two hands we'll see
the trick and while you're watching The
Magician's two hands
The Magician's assistant is doing the
trick
because you're you're looking in the
wrong place so here's the only thing I'm
going to add with certainty everything
else is just speculative but with
certainty we are blind to any third
killer
I don't know that there is one
Jenny says
Scott apologize for begging the
government for Mass testing for two
years no we we needed Mass rapid testing
that would have helped a lot
anybody who thinks that wouldn't have
helped
besides because the mass wrapper testing
would help you make your own individual
decisions are you opposed to people
making their individual health decisions
with Dana
that's just a silly thing to be against
and by the way the only reason we didn't
have them had to be corruption
all right
so
um have I made my point have I made my
point that if there's a third killer
there totally could be
and we would be blind to it
we would be blind to it
okay that's all yeah I'm not going to
state that those are killing people just
that we would be blind to it but I will
state that the extra stress is
guaranteed to cause more heart attacks
how about that we don't know if that's
what we're seeing
but would you say with a large
population if you substantially increase
their their
stress more heart attacks
the the part that and again I'll say it
again but not necessarily the athletes
you know The Athlete's dying looks like
it could be there could be a fourth
killer right we could have four things
killing people and only be seeing two
because we're we're just tuned to those
two
all right here's the question I asked uh
if an evil hypnotist
took control of tick tock's algorithm
could they use it to murder people
in a in a demographic now not murder a
specific person
although it could probably do that but
I'll say could it murder
lots of people you don't know which ones
just
yes
absolutely I if you gave me control of
tick tock's algorithm
and said here's who you we want you to
Target
we want you to increase the death rate
in this group of people you don't think
I could do that if I if I had control of
the algorithm
and I can say these people are going to
see this content oh I could do that
yeah I could do mass murder
and it wouldn't even be hard
like you know I'm not like the the super
hypnotist or anything it would just be
basic
pretty basic
for somebody who had just ordinary
persuasion skills if they were evil and
if they had full control of the
algorithm now
how lucky are we
that China hasn't figured that out huh
huh how lucky are we
that you know a podcaster here in the
United States can easily see it easily
see it very obvious and all of you as
soon as I said it said well you know it
is obvious you can definitely kill
people if you control the algorithm but
aren't we lucky
that China are adversary
who is sending in fentanyl to kill us by
the tens of thousands every year isn't
it lucky that they haven't like keyed in
on this
yeah by the way do you know that they
don't allow uh
Tick Tock to be used in China yeah the
Chinese owned a tick tock it's not
allowed in China
they have a different version that
doesn't have any of the problems
yeah so how lucky lucky lucky lucky
lucky
that the Chinese government hasn't
figured out what every one of you know
and is obvious that they could use that
algorithm to kill Americans
foreign
do you have any doubt that our Congress
is corrupt
none none now there may be members of
Congress who are not corrupt
like I have a good feeling about you
know Thomas Massey and Paul Rand and a
number of others but
clearly the reason that Tick Tock is
still legal in the United States clearly
is corruption
there's nothing else it could be
that nobody's even offered another
hypothesis
right
had there been another hypothesis where
somebody says you know Scott you're
forgetting all these good reasons why it
might not be so easy
there is no other argument
do we have any other National topic
where everybody's on the same side
I've never seen one everybody 100 of the
Congress is on the same side
and yet tick tocks are not banned
not banned not even close there's not a
vote I don't believe there's any
legislation
there's no conversation
right
that has to be massive corruption
give me any other hypothesis
any other hypothesis
there is none it's obvious and it's like
the the rapid testing scandal
that the news treated us like it was in
the Scandal
the biggest corruption we've ever seen
unless we find out something about the
vaccinations was as sketchy as it looks
was he recovered in the news does the
news cover the fact that there's no
debate on Tick Tock and yet no action
no no it's not covered on the left and
it's not covered on the right now in
both cases they complain about Fentanyl
and they complain about fentanyl deaths
but they don't complain about uh Tick
Tock killing people
and then tell us that nobody's doing
anything about it when that's obviously
the case
what else could it be I mean really
now here's a perfect situation where if
I were talking about an individual human
citizen
I would not say that they're guilty
without proof I'd say no no a citizen is
innocent
only you better you better bring some
serious proof if you're going to accuse
a citizen of a crime
but the government
the government is presumed guilty unless
they can show you some transparency to
show you that they're treating you
seriously and they have no transparency
no argument
they are guilty by definition
right in the same way a citizen is
Innocent by definition you know that's
our system just defines it that way
until guilty the government by
definition is guilty
by definition if they won't tell you or
even engage in the conversation
that's just guilty and anything that you
assume otherwise is doesn't make sense
yeah yeah the the tick tock is an
educational product and
in China
all right
um
and that ladies and gentlemen
uh let me let me give you another
um insight into this I'm not going to
tell you what the topic was
but several weeks ago
um
social media was messing with my head
because I made the mistake of looking at
some specific content you know nothing
disgusting don't don't be weird I looked
at some content you know legal ordinary
content and then the algorithm started
serving me more of it
and it really messed with my life
because I couldn't break the habit of
looking at
um
it was Instagram
I couldn't break the habit but it was
feeding me things that made it
impossible to sleep
I couldn't sleep
like for weeks it was only because there
was a recurring thought that the the
algorithm kept putting in my head and
every time it would like wear off
every time I looked at it would go back
in my head now it doesn't matter what
the content is
it only matters that I couldn't turn it
off and I couldn't stop looking at it
um
here's so so that actually caused me
major health problems
like actual health problems from
Instagram algorithm
not a joke
very clearly
a health problem because I couldn't
sleep more than a few hours a night for
night after night that's a health
problem that's pretty major health
problem right and that came just from
the algorithm
and it wasn't because I looked for
something it was because something was
served to me and now it wasn't about my
wasn't about my personal life
then here's another one
um
I found some humor and interest in some
anti-relationship content
meaning it was people saying that men
and women basically are never going to
get along because there's something
about Modern Life which made which has
made men and women toxic to each other
like we just don't have a way to be
partners anymore and it was it was
basically very strongly would encourage
you never to get married or be in a
serious relationship
and once I looked at some of them the
algorithm started to give me just just
bearing me with don't be in a
relationship
now would that be a benefit to China
to have an algorithm convince people not
to get married and have children
yeah
yep
if I if I were in charge of the
algorithm
I would be promoting
don't have children don't get married
don't do any kind of classical
relationship
it's all broken you have to you have to
go do something totally different you
know just feed you over and over again
and I started getting inundated
and at first I thought whoa these are I
love the fact that these are outside the
main screen right I love the way it's
expressed the the people who are on
these videos were really good they were
just charismatic they had good
communication skills and as content it
was good stuff just as content
entertaining but what did it do to my
life
had if I had been a younger person and I
was you know questioning whether I get
married and have kids it would
absolutely have reprogrammed me it was
strong enough
that it would have changed my
procreation preferences
it would have changed
my reproductive preferences
and I could feel it in real time
like I could feel it changing my brain
right and you saw me mention it a number
of times because you could see you know
it was it was taking up a little real
estate
and now just imagine somebody doing that
intentionally maybe it is intentional no
way to know but but imagine if I had
control of the algorithm
there's two examples where I know I
could make you less healthy
I can make you less healthy because I
experienced it I give you just
disturbing images and you wouldn't sleep
well and then your health would be bad
um or I could tell you that the things
which we know are good for you are
really bad for you
for example
if you were China would you let the
algorithm uh present lots of
being overweight is good for you uh
content
would you
do you think that the United States
which has always had a history of
telling people to exercise right through
the 60s and 70s and Arnold
Schwarzenegger the government has always
said oh exercise exercise is good for
you
but
what would China want the United States
to do
China would want us to value our fatness
and say don't change me this is just me
body positivity
and by the way the women can all weigh
400 pounds and you men you still want to
mate with them
because you know you don't want to be a
jerk
yeah
China could absolutely end us
just with tick tock and our our Congress
is completely blind to it
that's the best case scenario but I
think they're bought off
I think they're bought off so at this
point china has the the Fentanyl
intervenes
and they got the finger on the plunger
and the best we can hope for
is they don't push their finger on the
plunger
but the needles in our arms right the
tick tocks here it's already in our kids
hands the needle's in
all they have to do is push the plunger
and they can take out our whole society
if they haven't already
because what would it look like if they
did
body positivity
maybe maybe you should try being gay
maybe you shouldn't get married
maybe you should complain more about
wokeness because that's what's important
almost everything that's on social media
is destructive
now here's what I don't know is there
also a thriving Tick-Tock
pro-health exercise part of it that I
never see
maybe but you know that would still get
lost in the noise
yeah all right
yeah there's one uh if China wanted to
destroy the United States would they
promote
Andrew Tate's videos
think about it
if China wanted to destroy the United
States would they promote Andrew Tate's
videos
yeah who was the most viral content
recently
Andrew Tate the most viral and Tick Tock
was the leading cause of that right
was mostly a tick tock thing
so China
may have decided unless the algorithm
did it itself because Tate did a lot of
things to make things viral so I mean he
was he was pushing himself so we don't
know if that maybe that was enough
it looks like they're trying to
encourage obesity yeah
so I would just uh put that out there
that the the needles in the arm and
we're trusting our adversary not to push
the plunger so great job Congress that
ladies and gentlemen is the best live
stream you've ever seen I hope it
challenged your current thinking I don't
know if anything I'm saying is true
but I know we're not we're not thinking
broadly enough about what the
possibilities are that being my theme of
the day and YouTube I'm going to say
goodbye to you now
I'm going to talk to the locals platform
privately
um and I will see you tomorrow bye for
now best live stream you've ever seen
