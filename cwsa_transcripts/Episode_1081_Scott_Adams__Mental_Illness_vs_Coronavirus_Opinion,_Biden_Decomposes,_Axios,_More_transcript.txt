good morning
everybody it's time for coffee with
scott adams the best time of the day
except for any other times that i come
on periscope
which is the other best time of the day
and
what better way to get the day going
we get all kinds of fun stuff to talk
about
sure there are tragedies in the world
but you can't spend
all your time thinking about tragedy
sometimes
you gotta gotta get a little relief
gotta give your brain a break
that's why you're here to give your
brain a break we're going to talk about
the
fun and stupid and funny parts of the
world
but first into in order to enjoy it
fully
i recommend that you find yourself a
copper bug or a glass attacker cells or
steiner canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous zipper and it happens now
go
ahead it feels as though there's still
the same amount of stupidity in the
world but
it's not bothering me as much that's
what the simultaneous sip does for you
yeah let's talk about some fun things
there's a company that has
developed a face mask that can
translate into other languages when you
talk
how cool is that don't you want a face
mask
that can translate into other languages
while you talk
i would never i would never talk english
again
i'd just walk around talking other
languages and see if other people
knew who i was but i think this
mask that can translate into other
languages
probably is the beginning of the cyborg
age
where we just cover up all of this stuff
all this head stuff
you know once you've got something over
your eyes which will be your augmented
reality glasses
you've got something shoved in your ears
which will clearly
be your hearing devices you've got some
kind of a hat
because of the sun you've got some
sunscreen on you which in a way is sort
of a
chemical modification and then you've
got your face mask on you're good to go
full android capability the other thing
i would like to see
is i'd like to see a mask with echo
cancellation
so that i could have a conversation with
my mask on
that only goes through my phone and
nobody around me can hear it even if
they're sitting right next to me
is that possible probably not but i'd
like to have it
and how about a mask that lets you
speak commands into the mask to operate
anything that's a voice controlled
including your phone
yes full and full uh cyborg it's coming
well yesterday the president announced
that they would make permanent
the telehealth uh regulations i guess
they
they made it during the pandemic which
was still in they made the
telehealth legal across state lines
there may have been some other things
that they
did but now that's permanent
now how hard would it have been to make
telehealth permanent across state lines
if we had not had a pandemic it hadn't
happened yet
it was it was the most obvious thing you
could ever do
i mean it's obviously good for the
public it's
obviously going to lower health care
costs it's
obviously going to make health care more
available but without the pandemic
and you know and the opportunity that a
crisis created
i don't know if it would have happened
or at least not so soon
it's a pretty big deal so
you see the president now sort of
assembling
the parts of something that would look
sort of like
a health care i don't want to call it a
plan
but more of a health care series of
initiatives and executive orders and
whatnot that are all designed
collectively to
to create more competition
uh more transparency and
and fewer regulations now if you said to
me can we get to
universal health care or something like
it by just taxing everybody and saying
i don't know sounds pretty expensive
plus
it might not ever pass but can we
lower the cost of health care by making
a more competitive industry
by doing a variety of things that just
remove competitive
uh roadblocks to which i say apparently
so
apparently so i don't know that this
gets us to full coverage
but if you don't get the cost of health
care down
how could you ever talk about covering
everybody i mean
you know if if the president let me put
it in stark terms
prior to um the pandemic
and let's say we get back to there in a
year or so
i think uh something like nine percent
of the public
was not covered by health care
and although this next thing i'm going
to say doesn't make perfect sense
it just gives you a size of magnitude
that's all i'm trying to do
if we could cut the cost of health care
by 20
for everybody that kind of in in just a
conceptual way
frees up money that would be enough to
cover everybody
now if if i save money on my health care
that doesn't mean i'm going to pay more
taxes
to cover somebody else but you can see
that
it is probably more important to bring
the total cost of health care down
first to have any chance any chance of
covering everybody and i do think we
should cover everybody
let me ask you this you know there's a
big
question about whether illegal
illegal citizens in other words
undocumented
there's a conversation about whether
undocumented people should give free
health care because
apparently they can walk into the
emergency room and get it
and i suppose if they don't have any
health insurance then maybe
the hospital doesn't get paid so
what if there was some kind of a deal
where
any kind of undocumented person who got
health care
had to give a dna sample
and the dna sample you could
anonymize it so you don't necessarily
have to know it came from this person
oh but maybe you do yeah let's say you
do you you do know where it came from
and let's say that's the cost of free
health care yeah we'll give you free
health care
but we've got to get a sample of your
dna now there would be two benefits from
that one
the the crime from um
well the crime in general would be much
reduced by the the more dna we have of
people
but also if we have massive dna
samples we can find you know who is more
or less susceptible to
coronavirus who is more or less
susceptible
to this or that so the healthcare
outcomes
um so i'm just gonna this is just pure
speculation i won't make this a claim
it's just something to think about is
the opportunity for improving
not only crime solutions
but health care is it big enough that if
you had
such a large group of dna that you were
you were collecting and
they were non-citizens but it was just
sort of their part
you know it was in a sense they would
give up
privacy in this one way in return for
helping the outcomes of
all the other undocumented immigrants
because whatever health
outcomes were good for the country and
the world
would be good for everybody i'll just
put it out there
because you know you don't always have
to pay money for a service
perhaps you could pay in terms of your
dna because it does have a pretty
pretty large economic value
but obviously you're not going to give
it up unless you have to
or unless you volunteer to just put it
out there
um i was watching a clip do you remember
when
biden had this you've televised event
where you just talked to obama
so it was just obama and biden together
having a conversation for a
campaign event and i was listening to
that yesterday one of the things that
obama said was so telling
just listen to this i i wrote it down i
think i got it approximately right
and obama said the thing i'm confident
about is your heart
so he's talking to biden the thing i'm
confident about
is your heart now that's an interesting
choice of words
and i think i've told some of you before
that
uh hypnotists learn that
people reveal their hidden thoughts in
their choice of words
so if you look at the choice of words as
opposed to what the sentence says
you can often get an opposite meaning
from what the choice of words were
in this case can you think of any
situation
in which obama was confident in general
about biden just confident about
everything confident about his
decision-making
confident about his health confident
about his policies
confident about his heart when he use
this choice of words
the thing i'm confident about is your
heart
because i think if i were confident
about everything
i'd say something like you know i've
never been more confident in a candidate
to be the right choice right you'd say
something like that i feel like obama is
signaling
as clearly as you can that he's not
confident
in biden's brain that seems really
really clear if you read between the
lines
of course we can't know we're right but
i know i'm right isn't that the way
the american way is to have no way to
know that you're right
but you still feel completely confident
just the same
you should adjust you should adjust your
confidence and my confidence
by knowing that i couldn't know what
anybody's thinking
i can't read his mind but it is a
generally
useful thing to look at choice of words
and
you can definitely beat the averages if
you're guessing that you you know what's
going on all right
uh the american journal of political
science published a correction
so that's not too unusual right i think
half of published papers end up
not being true so they published a
correction this year
saying that a paper from 2012 oh that
was a long time ago 2012
has an error and here's what the error
was
uh they had done a study and they
decided that
conservatives were had were ranked
higher on
psychoticism now i'm not sure exactly
what psychoticism is
but it doesn't sound good and it turns
out that when somebody
reviewed their work they had some kind
of a
math or analytical error and it was
actually the opposite
so since 2012 there have been 45
different
citations and articles or whatever
saying that conservatives have been
shown to be
have higher psychoticism but they had
actually just
flipped it it was actually liberals who
had more psychoticism
and since 2012 that study has been
you know used as something that that
tells you something is true
it was just reversed this is a subset
of my theory that all data are wrong
now i like to say all data is wrong
because as a professional writer
i'm one of the people who is responsible
for
putting things into common usage
proper english data is plural so you'd
say the data are wrong just sounds like
a douchebag
i'm sorry you just sound like a
douchebag when you say the data
are wrong if you say the data is wrong
you don't sound like a douchebag but you
are technically incorrect
now it's my responsibility as i said as
a professional writer
to uh give cover to the rest of you
so this professional writer is going to
start saying
the data is wrong because it just sounds
better
i'm sorry it just sounds better and i
get to make that choice
you get to tell me i'm wrong but just
understand i'm doing it intentionally
that rule has to change
so i'll go first the data is wrong
and that anyway my point was it's
basically true
that all of our data for public
decisions
is wrong let me say that again
it's it's essentially true that all of
the data we use
for public decisions is wrong and not
just wrong in a little way
wrong as in the reverse wrong as in that
makes you look in the entirely
wrong planet for a solution i mean wrong
in the most
fundamental way anything can get wrong
and it's pretty much everything almost
everything
and you keep that frame in mind
because we're coming from a world only
months ago
where we thought okay i obviously
sometimes data is wrong
but most of the time smart people are
looking at it
and you know the critics have looked at
it and there's peer review
and there's you know you've got
respected journalists the new york times
are reporting it
so yeah i get it sometimes information
can be wrong
but not most of the time i mean most of
the time is right
right no it's wrong all the time
it's always wrong and until you realize
that the data
is always wrong for public decisions
sometimes for science too but for the
public decisions it's always wrong all
the time
and the reason is that you never see
data unless it gets filtered through
a person and that person is either
incapable or unwilling to tell you the
truth but they will certainly tell you
what they want you to believe
and if you hear my dog's sleep barking
that's what that little yelping is
and so just keep that in mind it's very
similar to
the hypnosis the hypnotist inversion if
i could call it that
when i first took hypnosis i went into
the class
assuming a similar thing which is that
ninety percent of the time people are
rational and they're using their logical
facilities
and maybe ten percent of the time
there's maybe one issue
that will make one of us crazy but in
general
we're these rational clear thinking
people
just sometimes we get a little crazy
once you learn hypnosis you realize it's
the reverse
that we're 90 irrational and that
little speck of time that we're rational
it's only because we don't care about it
we're only rational when we don't care
it's just a
emotion-free decision oh yeah
two plus two does equal four i'll take
four
so just keep that in mind that the data
is
always wrong and we learned that in 2020
but it's a tough lesson
uh we'll talk more about that in a
minute um
i've decided that it's getting harder
and harder to treat
obvious mental illness as an opinion
all right the antifa people we talked
about this before
the there may be some people who are
technically sane
but the people getting arrested the
troublemakers
you know a lot of the most active that's
just mental illness
can we stop saying that they have a
different political opinion
can we stop saying they have a plan you
know
chaos and uh anarchy are not really a
plan
that's mental illness until somebody
could describe how
anarchy gets you to a better place for
anybody
including the anarchist it's not really
a difference of opinion
it's just mental illness and
there's sort of a temporary version of
this you know that's
trump derangement syndrome i don't think
we have the luxury of thinking of trump
derangement syndrome
anymore as just a difference of
political opinion
it really isn't there there's something
else going on
now that doesn't mean that those people
who have trump derangement syndrome have
an organic mental problem but they might
have a
mental problem in the same same way that
ptsd
you know can scramble your brain the
same way that
you some kind of fear some abuse i guess
that'll
gets to ptsd but the point is that your
lived experience
can make you crazy about some topics
and i really think that when we talk
about this as differences of political
opinion
or differences and who can analyze
things better
or who has better data which isn't
really a thing
i i think that we just do a disservice
because we're just looking in the wrong
place
these are genuine mental health problems
and i
just think it helps to think of it that
way um
i've i feel a bit angry
at all the people who know what
president trump
should be doing and the plan that he
should be implementing
that would fix all this coronavirus
stuff
because according to the democrats there
is such a thing
as a plan that they have in their minds
that has the standard of how to do a
right
and if only the president would use that
plan that's in their heads
things would be a lot better and
why don't they tell us the plan
now you say to yourself scott scott's
got they have
in so many ways look at this link and
then you'll look at the link it'll be
some other country had a better result
so therefore if we do what that other
country did
we'll get the same result if you think
that
you should not make decisions in public
because all the other countries are so
fundamentally different
in so many different ways we have no
idea
what worked and didn't work with none we
have no idea what worked
we also don't know if their numbers are
true and we also don't know how the game
ends because we're at halftime
did australia really really do a great
job
on the coronavirus hard to say
because they're having a major flare-up
right now if you have a flare-up
doesn't that mean you didn't do a good
job or does that mean you did do a good
job because you only had one flare-up
and now if they tamp this back down
you'll say okay good job again
how do you even evaluate these things
because if we don't have a way to stop
the virus
there's no plan that looks anything like
something that could work besides what
we're doing which is to keep the economy
healthy
and take our losses but try to keep them
as low as possible
so every time you hear somebody say
why doesn't the president have a plan
first of all they're lying because the
plan is crystal clear i've explained it
many times
every part of the plan is public
and publicized it's the most it's the
most
clear plan you could ever have now
you know there of course there are
discussions about you know
opening up the schools etc but the
federal government
is very clear you can't say that the
federal government but
you know trump doesn't know exactly what
he wants he wants schools to open
we knew that we were trying to save the
health care
system from collapsing and we succeeded
and we knew that we were going to try to
buy time
until you know vaccines or therapeutics
and as long as we're as long as we need
an economy
we don't have the option of closing it
now let me explain to you what the
democrats seem to explain as their
their plan uh and i'll have to call in a
democrat to explain this dale
dale can you come over here i've uh we
want to learn about the democrat plan
for fixing everything because we know
that mr trump
he's doing everything wrong so dale can
you come over here
and explain um how to do it right
sure sure all you have to do
is wear masks well dale
that's it just have to wear masks as
most people are
wearing masks and all the places that
seem to matter
well maybe if the president wore a mask
i don't think that's it that's it that
would be your plan
your plan would just be to be the
president and wear a mask
and then everything would be okay no no
no you also have to close you got me
you gotta close the economy
okay dale so if you close the economy
does that have any
costs associated with it as well
dale say something
would any people die if you crushed your
economy
in the long run
dale dale say something
no we're talking looking at the big
picture we understand
that too many people have died but
i'm trying to understand your plan in
which you close the economy
are there no costs associated with that
in terms of
long-term well-being of the people and
even lives
can you say more about that
um dale you're gonna have to talk
say something say something on the topic
of the economy closing
and what that does to people's lives
and their health their mental health and
their ongoing well-being can you please
speak to that
la la la la la la la la
thank you dale so we have this absurd
situation which people who don't know
how to compare anything
don't know how to analyze anything
are informing the public let me give you
an example
so there's big news today axios did an
interview one-on-one with
i guess swann was talking to the
president they had
two chairs you know apart from each
other
and there's one uh part of that that's
getting a lot of play which is the
president
shuffling some papers with some graphs
and trying to make his case
about the statistics now
ah this did not go well
if you saw the clip i think you'd agree
with me
didn't go well didn't go well for the
president but here's what i would
um i would recommend
never put the president of the united
states
in a chair with no desk so the the no
desk part is important
never put the president of the united
states in a chair
on camera and give him multiple pieces
of paper
with complicated data on it and ask him
to speak to it
don't ever put the president in that
position
if the president had said hey can
somebody print out
you know those statistics so when i'm
talking to this
reporter you should have said
no and figured out
something else to do because let me tell
you
this is not a good look um i've got some
data here and uh
let's see about infections or uh
the rates and other countries
do not put your president in that
situation
all right now i'm sure you know if if i
knew the details he probably
you probably wanted to be in that
situation because he probably wanted the
data in his hands
but we don't want we the public
i think i can speak for everybody in the
public
we the public don't want to see a
journalist
and a politician arguing about
statistics
do you want to see that because the
journalist didn't understand the topic
you know any more than a journalist
would and probably the journalist is
still back in
let's say january 2020 thinking
where the journalist imagined that the
data
could be right whatever the data said
i think the journalist might have been
under the impression
that there's some kind of data that
would be accurate
that's not qualified to talk about data
on tv
the president had more data than he
needed
and probably would have been better
served by picking
one or two statistics he could remember
off the top of his head
and just sticking to it whatever those
statistics are
but shuffling the papers don't ever do
that again
now if he had a desk in front of him
where he could lay out his materials so
there's no shuffling
then that's good those are just notes to
remind him how to talk but don't put him
in a chair
with no table and a bunch of papers in
his hand my god
don't ever do that again uh
that's my advice all right um
did you see the uh oh well
so much to talk about today um
have you noticed that writers can't tell
the difference between an argument
and an insult have you seen that it
looks like this
if i say to a writer let's say on
twitter
if i say something like what should
trump do differently with this
coronavirus
you know what what what should be a
better plan than what's happening now
you'll get some good answer like that
well he's an unstable authoritarian who
denies science
to which i think i think that's just an
insult
that didn't really quite address my
question
and that i think part two is you got to
get rid of trump and get somebody who is
not a
not one of those unstable authority
authoritarian
science deniers which of course he isn't
um and i don't know if they can tell the
difference and i just quoted by the way
uh carl bernstein so they're they're
trotting out the worse than watergate
guy who just comes out to say things are
worse than watergate
or that trump is nixon and it is just so
funny when that guy comes out
like i he uh he used to bother me
but now it's so funny it's like oh they
got carl bernstein out to say it's worse
than the watergate
every month or so you can renew that
play
all right here's an idea
that someone on twitter suggested
that would solve the the pandemic and it
goes like this
we will take the technology we don't
have
oh okay i guess that's hard
we'll take the technology that doesn't
exist
okay but imagine it did so i'm
i'm uh just wading into this so i don't
have enough information on this but the
claim is this
that if you did less accurate testing
but more of it especially if you can get
instant
or near instant answers you can imagine
the situation where
kids going into school you know swab
something
and then look at it and it either tells
them they have coronavirus or not
but it wouldn't be super accurate and
not as good as a real clinical test
and the claim is that although they
would not be
super accurate there would be sort of
accurate issue enough
that you would catch enough cases that
you would at least get the you know the
the r the r value the the spread value
below one and then then you'd have
something there
and so my question is does there exist
such tests which although not perfect
are good enough and cheap enough
that you could test for a dollar and
have an answer in a minute or five
minutes or something
do those exist because i get a lot of
yeah don't worry about the false
negatives and don't worry about the
false positives
the idea is that if the inaccurate tests
pick up something you could then do an
accurate test
to confirm but at the very least you'd
say well we might have a problem with
this class
so you guys go home until we sort it out
so you could imagine
somebody's saying yes just use saliva
so you can imagine that if these tests
existed
if they were cheap if they were
widespread if everybody
tested once a day no matter what you
could get on top of it but it
it feels like a magical thinking
solution
because i don't think we have it i don't
think we have tests like that
i would love to see something from the
president or the task force
telling us how close we are to anything
like that or any kind of news coverage
of a company
that's making something like that now
the cousin to that is doing uh group
testing
so that would be if everybody everybody
in the class
you know spit into something or swab
something
and then you take the entire class and
test them as a group
if you find nobody in the class has it
well you're done
but if you find that somebody in class
has it then you can test them
individually
so you can you can get big groups of
people
with one test so long as it ends up
being negative
um so that's another path but i believe
our experts are
probably up to date on all this stuff
and if this were practical
i have confidence that somebody like
burks or fouchy or somebody would be
saying hey let's do all these tests
all right so i don't think it's
practical but i wonder how far we are
from it
here's an argument that i heard
yesterday from somebody
far far smarter than i am
far far smarter and when i hear things
that
are sort of above my brain's
pay grade i like to run it by you
because some of you
can handle that stuff and it goes like
this
so we've got um there are two types of
hydroxychloroquine
tests that we know of they're really
well done
tests that test the wrong stuff
and then there were lower quality tests
that test
something closer to the right thing
which is early use
and then all three drugs with the zinc
and azithromycin
etc now the argument is
that the ones that are uh really good
tests show the hydroxychloroquine
is not effective but since they tested
the wrong stuff that doesn't really
tell us much they tested people who were
hospitalized didn't give them all three
drugs gave them too much
so those tests didn't have much value
but what about all the tests i think
there are 65 of them and growing
probably more by now of tests that were
low quality
but seem to indicate that
hydroxychloroquine works
if you saw one test that was
low quality meaning it doesn't it's not
a confirmation
but it showed hydroxyclean works what
would be your
rational opinion of that your rational
opinion should be
one study it's like a coin flip
because half of studies are wrong not
reproducible
so really i don't know if i know
anything it's like a coin flip maybe
works maybe it doesn't
but suppose you had 65 tests
and a whole bunch of different ways of
looking at it and
all the tests were different but by
coincidence
they had by by a great majority
maybe not everyone but by large majority
they seem to show it works
and the argument is this and i'll see if
i can present it right
if you do one test that's not reliable
on
hydroxychloroquine there might be
several different reasons why it's wrong
if you do 65 tests you've got a whole
bunch of different ways that each of
those tests will be wrong
and the speculation is the smarter
person says
is that enough to tell you something and
that's what i'm going to present to you
is it because
each of these tests no matter what their
variables were or how they looked at it
seem to indicate the same direction that
there's some effect
but given that they're all flawed but
here's the key
they're all flawed but they're all
different takes
you know in other words they did a
different thing if all the people doing
different things
individually were not reliable but by
coincidence
they all seem to show some effect or
most of them
does that tell you something and
there are smart people who say yeah that
does tell you something
it's certainly enough to give it a try
given that it's inexpensive and
won't kill you so i put that out there
is that a is that a reasonable uh
approach
all right um by now most of you have
seen the new
george floyd body cam video
um and of course it's you know two
movies on one screen situation
everybody's seeing what they want to see
i would say at this point there isn't
the slightest chance
that the police officers will be charged
with murder
or if they are there isn't i'm sorry
there isn't the slightest chance they'll
be convicted of murder i think they've
already been charged
but when you see the video it's just
crystal clear
that this was a horrible mistake now
they could be
guilty of i don't know not trying hard
enough
to revive him of of not you know
following some procedure i don't know
maybe but i'll tell you what it's not
it's definitely not murder it's not even
close
and here's the the kill shot you know if
if those police officers want to save a
lot of money
on lawyers i can present their whole
case for them it goes like this
george floyd was saying i can't breathe
before he even got in the car
which is before he got on the ground
which is before they were on top of him
his breathing difficulty he said
directly
he said it out loud and it's on video he
was having breathing problems before
any of the bad interactions encountered
and if it's true that the fentanyl in
him was
three times the overdose amount
then he was going to die
no matter what but
um i would certainly i would certainly
question whether the police officers
did enough to keep him alive once it was
obviously edited he had some kind of a
problem
so that that's certainly worth looking
into and i think that's really
disturbing
part of what we saw in that video or
maybe was a different one is that one of
the
bystanders who saw george floyd
look like he was unconscious one of the
bystanders was
screaming at the police to check his
pulse
just screaming at the police and the
police were just ignoring him
and the bystander was completely right
he's saying
check his polls check his pulse you're
not even checking his pulse
and that that has to be answered for
okay that really needs an answer and if
the police are
if there's some penalty for whatever
that was about
i still have to hear their side of it
but whatever that was about
that's not good right so certainly the
police officers
are not in the clear but it's really
clear that they weren't out to murder
anybody
that that much is completely obvious um
and i found that uh
this is my opinion i think black lives
matter is completely discredited at this
point does it feel like that to you
i'm not talking about black people
of course i'm just talking about black
lives matter the the movement
isn't it totally discredited at this
point
because it just seems ridiculous and it
also
is uh the lowest priority
in the black community now if you tell
me it's not
i'd say oh well i see the problem how
will the black community
ever make progress if they can't tell
the difference between their highest
priority
which would be education which would be
getting rid of the teachers unions
which would basically make everything
better from economics to
to violence to health outcomes just
everything
versus the police violence which will
affect x number of people
as tragic as it is as much as we need to
make that better
it's the smallest priority it's the
smallest priority
so how am i supposed to take serious
seriously
a group that says black lives matter
while they're making the entire country
focus exclusively on the least important
part
of black lives that's exactly like black
lives don't matter
because if i said to you all right which
of these is more like black lives
matter is the one that does the thing
that doesn't make any difference
sorry didn't that slip down or is it the
thing that changes everything
the thing that can really fix things for
generations
to come which would be education which
would be getting the teachers unions
uh out of the log jam or creating the
log jam
so there would be competition so that
the charter and other schools could
actually teach people
and that they could have good lives so i
refuse to take
blm seriously until they take themselves
seriously
until they can figure out what their top
priority is and stop focusing on the
smallest one
i'm not going to take you seriously and
i don't think you should either
but happy to help on the big problem
which is teachers unions
did you see the video of there were some
protesters they were trying to make
their way to the seattle police chief's
house private house and uh some citizens
with a pickup truck and a very large gun
or more stopped them and send them back
you have to watch it and one of the pro
this is the the money shot here one of
the protesters on the video
when confronted with the armed citizens
protecting the police
said quote we're peaceful you pointed a
gun at my face
and then the resident with a gun said
that's why you're peaceful
[Laughter]
that's why you're peaceful because i got
a gun at your head
now how bad are things
when the citizens are protecting the
police
that's literally what happened that
that's not i'm not
i'm not overstating that this was
citizens
protecting the police that's a crazy
upside down world now this is the reason
that i'm
less concerned that a lot of people that
this will spread to
rural areas and spread into the suburbs
this guy with a pickup truck that's why
it won't spread into the suburbs
because it doesn't take many of those
guys who just stand in the road
with it with a weapon and say how about
we're done
how about you're done here it doesn't
take many of them
for uh for the the spreading to stop and
frankly the people with the guns don't
give a about the cities
so the cities may be in trouble i guess
facebook just
bought a whole bunch of property in new
york city for future
operations so facebook thinks new york
city will be a good place to live
it's not like the cities will go away i
just don't think they'll ever be the
same
how about how about this
um how about that that's all i've talked
about today
all right um the best way to signal in
public
that you don't understand anything about
the world
is is to compare how the united states
is doing on the coronavirus
to any other country or any other two or
three countries
so let me say this as clearly as i can
so you don't make the same mistake
if you think it means something to
compare how the united states is doing
with the coronavirus
to any other country whether they're
doing better or worse if you think it
means something
you don't understand really anything
about how the world works
it doesn't mean anything we don't know
why other countries are doing what
they're doing we don't know if their
numbers are accurate and we don't know
if they will flare up later and we're
just on different schedules for
flare-ups
none of that's known we also could look
at what they're doing and say okay they
did
x y and z but x y and z have not been
studied meaning that we don't know
exactly
what things work and what don't we don't
know if the culture is different we
don't know
you know what exactly the factors are
could it be the vitamin d the
hydroxychloroquine
that they may or may not be using could
it be who knows
so if you find yourself doing that hey
what about taiwan you should not make
decisions in public
because you just can't compare you know
island nations to other nations
etc can't be done but as i was saying
before
could we find out something if we looked
at the whole group
of let's say all of the all the
countries that did well
after it's done we don't know yet who's
going to do well when it's all done
new zealand could be the biggest hotspot
in the world in a month you just don't
know
but if we looked at them all eventually
we might be able to tease out of the
numbers like well
it wasn't obvious at the time but it was
this or that that made the big
difference
we don't know that now so we'd just be
guessing
um that is all i've got for now
get your weight down that is right
um let me give you my best tip
for losing weight would you like that
this
for some of you this will be this will
change your lives and i mean that
i mean that literally the next thing i'm
going to say given that there are
3 600 people watching probably a hundred
thousand people will watch this
eventually
out of a hundred thousand people there
are some number of you who are going to
hear what i say next it will just
totally change your life
it goes like this if you're trying to
lose weight
don't treat your cravings and your
hunger as the same thing
meaning that your cravings usually for
sugar
are not really a genuine hunger
and so what i recommend if you're trying
to lose weight
is that first you work only on your
sugar cravings
but you eat as much as you are of things
that are good for you
you can't eat too much broccoli all
right
so fill yourself up with you know lean
fish and broccoli and nuts and stuff
that's good
and don't ever let yourself be hungry
just work
on one at a time let's say you've got 10
sugary things you like
it's like oh i like ice cream i like
cake i like candy whatever whatever it
is that
your problem is and then just first week
or two
just get rid of one of the sweets that's
it
eat as much as you want you might even
be gaining weight you're even eating the
other sweets
you just got rid of one then get rid of
another one
once you've worked yourself down to
there's only one suite left that you've
allowed
yourself you're not going to want to use
so much of that
that it makes a difference and by then
you'll be close enough to be able to
just
knock it out if you wait about my
experience is about
two months and that thing that was the
most delicious thing in the world
will look at gross and i did
i've done this experiment time and time
again with the snickers candy bars
so my biggest addiction is a snickers
candy bar
and when i'm having too much sugar the
the feeling i get just biting into one
my whole body comes alive i mean the the
it's just physically delightful in a way
that it's hard to explain
but that's only if i'm still hooked on
sugar
and no matter how good you are at
getting off the sugar you may have
relapses i do it all the time
then i have to work myself off it but at
the moment since i've been off more than
two months
i can hold those snickers in my hand and
imagine what it would taste like
and it's just gross and nothing changed
nothing changed except that i waited two
months and then the craving went away
so work on your craving by decreasing
your
sugar things as well as your simple
carbs like
white rice and bread and stuff like that
so just start
decreasing them until those are gone you
may have even gained weight
because you ate so much broccoli and
salmon and nuts
and then if that's your diet broccoli
and
salmon and nuts adjusting that down a
little bit you know ten percent or
whatever
so that you your your calories are in
line exercising a little bit more
it's a lot easier so that is my advice
divide and conquer never ever ever
work on a craving at the same time as
hunger
like actual hunger you don't want to
deal with
two enemies on two fronts at the same
time divide and conquer
that little bit of advice for the
hundred thousand of you working
watching this probably at least five
thousand of
you just said holy crap would that work
some of you are going to try it it works
now i can't guarantee that any any plan
or any diet works for 100
of people that would be crazy but out of
100 000 people
i probably just changed at least a
thousand lives
fairly fairly significantly so that's
why i do this
that's what it's all about and i'll talk
to you tomorrow
