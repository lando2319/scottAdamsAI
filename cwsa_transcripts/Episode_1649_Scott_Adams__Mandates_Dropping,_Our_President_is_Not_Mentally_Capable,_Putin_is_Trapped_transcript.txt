the day
and the best moment of the best
experience of the day right now uh it's
gone it's gone but it was pretty good
well it lasted
hey how would you like to take it up a
level
and i think we need to
drink our morning toast
to the truckers
about it
anybody in for the truckers
let's uh support the truckers support
the citizens who want to end the mandate
let us claw back our rights
claw them back i say now you might say
claw them back i never left them
well whatever you want to call it let's
get things back to normal
and we're going to make the government
do it
for us but first all you need is a cup
of muggle glasses tinker chelsea steiner
canteen juggerflask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine the other day thing makes
everything better even the mandates
eventually we'll get there
join me now for the unparalleled
sip go
yeah this is the best part of your day
that's right
that's right it is
so
let's talk about all the things that are
happening
rasmussen had a poll um which again
i think it
i think it delves deeply into
understanding the psychology of the
human mind
most polls just tell you some data but
not this one this one goes a little
deeper
it asks two questions
three actually but two that i care about
and i talked about the abc suspension of
whoopi goldberg
and how many people agreed with the
suspension
before i tell you the answer how many
how many people
cross section of the country
america how many of them thought abc
should suspend
whoopi what is your guess 25
the answer was 54
are you a little shocked by that does
that sound wrong
54 thought she should be suspended
for what having a historical uh
historical uh imperfection in her
understanding
what
54 think you should be canceled for that
well does it get crazier wait for it
wait for it
you don't think it gets crazier
oh it does
same poll
rasmussen also
same poll
uh actually i think they asked him at
the same time but i actually i don't
know for that for sure
but
the question was asked also do you think
canceled culture has gotten out of
control
now remember that 54 of the people who
answered
said that whoopi should be suspended
and then they asked has cancelled
culture gotten out of control
and 67 percent said yes
so two-thirds of the country thinks this
canceled culture has gone too far
while 54 of them 54 think that whoopi
should get cancelled
wait what
how can both of those things be true
but there's human beings for you
so what does it really come down to it
really comes down to
do you like whoopi goldberg
yeah or are you on her team basically
has more more about politics than her i
think
so people are happy to cancel people who
are on their team
right
if somebody's on your own team or you'll
you don't want them canceled but if
they're on the other team you're like
you're all about cancel culture aren't
you not you specifically but
apparently the public
now
this brings me to me
and i would like to say something to
some of you but many of you have already
blocked and cancelled
how many of you have tried to cancel me
in the last two years
for my opinions
a lot
yeah a lot of my audience has tried to
cancel me
for a difference of opinion
literally a difference of opinion
now much of the
much of the thoughts about me are based
on something that never happened
so most of what people are mad about me
are literally things that didn't happen
so every day somebody says well why were
you so pro mandate and i'd say that
never happened i don't even know who
you're talking about
they'd say you were really pushing those
masks
and i say that never happened
i've talked about them
i've never promoted them
about uh you pushed you really uh
you were in the bag for the vaccine
makers to which i say who are you
talking about that literally never
happened
but
doesn't matter
i still get cancelled so i i've lost 25
something like that of you know my
audience just because they disagreed
with that opinion
so
when you're criticizing the other people
for canceling
just be aware that it's not always the
other people canceling right there's a
whole lot of cancelling going on and
it's basically just people you disagree
with at this point i'm not even sure
canceling is real
let me go further
i don't think cancellation even happens
i think it's just team play
and if a team can get away with it they
do
if a team can't get away with it they
don't
but there's no canceled culture there's
just people trying to cancel each other
and sometimes it works
so there's no good and bad people when
it comes to canceling everybody's bad
that's my opinion
uh biden's being asked to take a
cognitive test
and i guess nearly 40 republicans
including
ronnie jackson who used to be the
president's physician
trump's physician
they're they're all uh bringing it up
and even james rosen asked the question
i like that how he asks he goes i'd like
to raise a delicate subject
but with utmost respect for your life
accomplishments and the high office you
hold
that's about as
that's about as well as you can ask that
question
think about
what it's like to ask the president of
the united states in public
if he's mentally incapable
that's a pretty delicate thing isn't it
but look at the i don't know how much
time he spent on the lead up to the
question but i'll bet he spends a lot of
time i like to raise a delicate subject
but with the utmost respect for your
life accomplishments and the high office
you hold
now that is how to ask a question
that is how you ask that question nicely
done james rosen
uh he said a poll released this morning
by politico morning consult found that
49 of registered voters remember this
isn't this isn't just republicans but 49
of registered voters disagreeing with
the statement joe biden is mentally fit
and when rosen asked biden
why he thought so many people believe
that biden responded i have no idea
that feels like a confirmation
i have no idea
i feel as though a mentally fit person
could have answered that question a
little more a little more capably a
little bit better
for example they might have said oh
that's mostly politics and people
believing things out of context
i might have said yeah you can make
anybody look ridiculous with video edits
you might say oh i think my age is
starting to show a little bit but my
decision making is still solid you're
all in good shape
there are so many ways to answer that
question
but i have no idea is the only one that
makes it sound like it's true
that he's mentally incapable
so he picked that one
and why is it that we've gone this long
without a cognitive test of the
president
now what would the percentage of the
public need to be
that strongly suspected the president
was not mentally fed what percentage of
the public
should pretty much automatically
trigger that kind of a test
25
25 might be
too low
because i think you could get 25 percent
of anybody to attack any president right
about 50 percent
if 50 of the public
was concerned about the president's
mental health
don't you think that should trigger a
cognitive test
now maybe it you know 50 based on three
different polls or something like that
but
shouldn't we have some kind of a
standard
i'm not even sure 40 is is high enough
because 40
ends up being really close to the
political party number
you you need to get a bunch of people
from the other team
or i don't think it counts
and at 54 you're getting a bunch of a
bunch of democrats right i think
unless it's just all independents i
suppose
but i i think 50 should be our are cut
off
for automatic cognitive tests
and why can't we make that a standard
it doesn't have to be a law
but you know there are certain standards
such as presidents give you their tax
returns and things like that so we do
have things that are just standards we
agree are reasonable
and i would like to put it out there
that if you're over 50
in in national polls
maybe maybe you need three polls just to
make sure you don't have an outlier poll
but let's say if you have three polls
that put you over a 50
automatic
cognitive test who would disagree with
that and by the way it should it should
apply if it's trump it should apply for
anybody right i'm not taking sides
does anybody disagree with that
now i'd like to like to remind you that
prior to
trump running the first time i always
said that we shouldn't have presidents
that old
so i was never in favor of anyone
trump's age being president i'm just not
in favor of that
but it happens
you disagree bradley disagrees
interesting
oh how about test everybody over the age
of 75. well you know
i'm not sure that's necessary i used the
example of chris wallace yesterday i was
amazed to find out you're 75.
do you think chris wallace needs a
cognitive test
you know the joking aside yeah okay
joking aside though come on i know
you're being political now but joking
aside he doesn't need a he doesn't need
a cognitive test i don't think so
well okay maybe you think so
all right
let's see what else is going on here um
so rumble
the competitor to youtube let's free
speech kind of an entity i guess i
should disclose
that because rumble um partnered with
locals
i think i have some kind of shares of
something
so i have some kind of conflict of
interest in this that you should be
aware of
but rumble
has offered a hundred million dollars to
joe rogan if he leaves spotify and goes
to their platform
now how smart is that offer
now you know that spotify is being asked
to fire joe rogan and it's a lot of
pressure etc but how smart is that offer
no assuming
assuming that they can come up with 100
million i don't know how you do that but
i suppose if joe rogan wanted to come
over they could raise 100 million per
easily
yeah it's like the smartest thing you've
seen today because if joe rogan says no
then rumble got a whole bunch of free
publicity
if he says yes
then it's even better
it couldn't it couldn't get much better
than this yeah so
i know dave rubin was part of the
decision i don't know who else was part
of it but i always say this about dave
rubin he does a lot of smart stuff
if you if you haven't noticed
he he's somewhat consistently on the
smart side of things
so i'm not surprised he was in the room
when when this
idea came about it was just a smart
thing just you can't lose with that that
offer
so i saw a number that i don't believe
somebody tell me if this is just to a
fact check other because the tweed
didn't have a source but i saw a tweet
that said 90 000 uh trucks have
registered for the convoy in dc
is that even possible i don't believe 90
000
do you
um it was his idea i'm seeing somebody
say it was dave rubin's idea i would not
be surprised
uh
okay
so uh
90 000 truckers is that real
i don't i don't think so but let's say
there are a lot of them
meanwhile there are trucker convoys all
over the place you can read all about
them but the uh
if you thought this trucker convoy thing
was going to be brief and then go away
apparently not
apparently the trucker thing is just
growing and it's growing internationally
and this is what i call productive
pressure
this is productive pressure it's a great
time to be alive honestly
um
i think this is a good
lesson for the children who are watching
it
it's a tough time to be a kid masks and
a really tough time to be a kid but one
of the things the kids are going to get
out of this is watching the adults
navigate this situation
and what we hope they're watching
we hope
is they're watching the the adults fight
like hell
to claw back their rights especially for
the kids
now you hope the kids remember this
don't you
don't you hope they remember this
because
these truckers are fighting for them
and they're fighting against their
governments
what they think are oppressive
requirements
and
they're they're putting the energy into
it
this is the best fight
you will ever see
because both sides are trying to protect
the public
now you could argue one side is being
too political the
side in this case not being democrat or
republican but the side being anybody
who wants the mandates in place more
republican or more democrats and
republicans
but
what is better than a fight
where everybody's trying to win the best
outcome for the public
that's really good that's productive
so
this is the kind of protest that is
nothing but productive the government
requires this kind of public involvement
to do what it probably wants to do which
is get back to something like normal
but we need to push it
it's not going to happen on its own
do you know what governments are really
good at
creating new
rules and policies
they're good at creating new ones
you know what they're bad at
ending anything
right
bad at ending vietnam bad at ending
afghanistan
bad at ending anything
right
i think you'd all agree with that
governments are good at starting batted
ending do you know who's good at ending
things
the public
right
so what you're seeing on one hand it
looks like you know some kind of a fight
you know there's some kind of fight
happening between the governments and
the people that's not exactly what's
happening
it's not exactly what's happening i i
think another filter on this is that
it's a handoff
basically the government needs the
public
to do what the public is doing push hard
so that the public so the politicians
have the cover to do what they probably
want to do which is get back to normal
now i i've never believed the the
politicians want us to be oppressed
forever for nefarious reasons and if
there are if anybody has that opinion
it's not just your rank and file
members of congress you know they're not
thinking that
so
you know if some do
they're not the ones who matter for this
so
i think we should be seeing this as sort
of uh two parts working together our
government being a good starter
our public being a good finisher
and the and the government is starting
to hand off
as you see the dominoes falling you know
one state after another announcing the
end of mandates
you're starting to see the handoff
and there's nothing wrong with that
so
we should see it as a
fight only to the extent that you have
to fight for freedom but it's not a
fight against each other
that's one of the things we all have to
understand and i think we do because
these protests have been largely
peaceful right
so
we this is brother against brother
sister against sister
this is not a fight fight
this is a handoff
and if you treat it as a handoff
it's the public that can claw back their
rights not the government the government
can't give us our rights back we have to
go get it
and now it's time the hardest part was
waiting wasn't it
the hardest part was waiting for the
right moment because if you start too
soon you lose your credibility
if infections are going through the roof
and you're trying to get back your
rights well it's a weaker argument even
if you think the mandates didn't work is
still a weaker argument because peop
other people think they did
so finally finally
the data is in the point in omicron and
vaccinations and all that the other
stuff
finally we reached the point
where the public can take the hand off
and they are they stepped up so you're
seeing something that looks like a fight
which is in my opinion everything
working the way it's supposed to work
it's working exactly the way it's
supposed to work and it looks like it's
on schedule somewhat
meaning that in the next several weeks
we're going to see big changes
of getting back to normal just the way
it should work
so if you're feeling
down about any of this
it's all heading in the right direction
and it's not going to stop
so the the public have taken control
exactly as they were supposed to do this
is everything working the way it's
supposed to work just slower than you
want it's just slower that's the only
problem
well i one of my favorite uh hobbies as
i've said before
is watching ben shapiro
annihilate people's bad arguments
and here's one that just made me laugh
so you know there's the uh
there's
is it uh flores
the gentleman who's challenging the fact
that the nfl coaches are all white while
70 of the players are black and if you
hear that
statistic
without any context
you'd say to yourself well that's a
pretty obvious discrimination
and if they can fix it in basketball
you know basketball has roughly the you
know a good number of black coaches
and that seems to make more sense with
the number of black players
and so ben shapiro
tweets in response to uh you know why
aren't there you know if 70 of uh
the players are black why do we have any
black coaches and ben shapiro tweets 70
of nfl players are black what are the
odds
because he was responding to a tweet
that said what are the odds
now here's the beautiful part about this
ben doesn't need to complete the
argument because because it just sits
there complete the way it is
here's the complete argument
either both things are racist or neither
it's either racist the 70
of players are black
how in the world does that happen by
accident
or it's racist that we have no black
coaches again how the hell does that
happen by accident
right
so here's the problem
you can't have it both ways
you can't have it both ways if you're
even trying to be smart
the only way you could try to be smart
is to say they're either both racist
or they're not both not you just can't
have it both ways you can't have hey
there's nothing to see here 70 of the
athletes are black
and then you know there's nothing to see
here
it just doesn't work so
i think if uh
shapiro took the argument further he
would get into hey your racist territory
but just putting it out there is just
hilarious
like the the argument doesn't need to be
completed it could just lay there and
let people deal with it
anyway that always amuses me
more about ukraine
um
was i one of the first people you saw
and i can't remember
if i read it first some submit this is
just one of those cases i need you to
check
check my memory
was i one of the first people to say
putin is really screwed because he can't
attack and he can't not attack
well he doesn't have any options i guess
other people must have said that
but i'm starting to see that as more of
a mainstream opinion
that uh i think biden's winning
right
it looks like biden actually played this
maybe i mean it's way too early to know
but at the moment
it looks like the biden administration
may have played this perfectly
now i don't know that's not to say that
trump or somebody else wouldn't have
done better we don't know that
but
at this point it looks like
putin really can't attack
that it looks like we've made such a
clear price for that
that it would be crazy now one of the
things that you forget about is that
russia requires chips
they require microchips and they require
a lot of specialized equipment that
maybe they could get from china but they
wish they hadn't
so
the argument is that putin either needs
to be
let's say a little buddy of america
or a little buddy of china
because it's you know it's just the i
don't need to give you the whole reasons
but by the time we get into space russia
is going to want to have a partner
and
at least some thinking i read this
morning and i i forgot who wrote it
wrote it but there's at least one school
of thought that says that putin would
prefer to be allied with the united
states
what do you think of that
what do you think of the and i think
this would just be more speculation
do you think it's true
that if putin had a choice
he would rather have a strong
association with the united states
compared to china
now i suppose he'd want a strong
association with both i guess
but
russia has more in common with china
somebody's saying i don't know i don't
think so because i think culture is
closer to the us and that matters more
and race too frankly
you know you hate to say that race is in
every single story but it's pretty much
in every single story
i think that the the russians just have
more
just more uh i don't feel for the united
states
i'm guessing
governing philosophy is similar i don't
know
i'm not sure that that binds any two
countries
any chance we could be allies with china
i don't think so
i don't think culturally that's going to
work
not in the short run
all right well
so
i would say again that we have a
situation here where putin requires a
creative access strategy
and a creative exit strategy would look
roughly like this
making it look like he got something but
not giving him anything
or
it could be giving him something
in return for some other thing that has
nothing to do with ukraine
so it seems to me that the real deal may
not ever be known by the public
much like the cuban missile
if there any historians here
historians please help me out
my understanding is the cuban missile
deal
was a secret deal
is that that's true right that what the
public thought the deal was is not what
the actual deal was it was there was a
deal behind the scenes
so
will we ever know what the deal is
and should we
i'm not sure we should
i'm i'm
you're incorrect scott john cook says
incorrect that it was a secret deal
say more about that if you're if you're
sure about it
um but the point is whether the cuban
missile crisis was secret or not uh we
could certainly make secret deals
and i think we have to get creative now
and i would love to know what's being
bandied about
the thing we would want more most i
think
is
some help against china in the future
um
so i
we gave up missiles in turkey but i
think there was more than that we gave
up
i think there was even a deeper secret
than the missiles in turkey i think that
was the fake out part
all right
so anyway we'll see what happens there
but i think something creative might
come out of that that might be positive
meanwhile nbc is on track for the lowest
winter
olympics
ratings of all time
yay
are any of you watching even one event
in the winter olympics
which i call the thanks for the fentanyl
olympics
nope nope nope
i will not click on a link i will not
i won't even turn on my tv so that it
accidentally tunes
tunes to that network as i'm flipping
through the channels
does anybody flip through channels
anymore is that even a thing
i just use apps i don't flip through
channels anymore
um
yeah i don't have channels either i just
have alps
they're two very old cold they're very
much still in charge you must kick the
farm before russia
now you know
you think that biden and putin both have
to be gone before we could be friends
with russia
maybe but i think they're both flexible
enough
if it made sense
so uh
how about uh how about a hand for the
public
so what has the public done recently
well the public is
tearing
down the mandate walls
it looks like the public has told nbc to
go themselves
if they're going to cover the olympics
that's the public
that is not our government
that is the american public doing what's
right for fentanyl for the uyghurs for
our economy because of the wuhan lab
potentially
and this is the public talking
so the public
has
decided um
and uh how about the cancellation of joe
rogan
do you think that'll happen
nope
nope it won't happen do you know why joe
rogan won't won't be canceled
the public
the public
yeah the public who seems to be taking
charge of the country
am i wrong
the public has decided that joe rogan
will either stay or get a raise am i
right
the public has decided joe rogan is
either going to stay a spotify or he's
going to get a raise that's it
the public has decided the mandates are
coming down they're coming down
and the public has decided we didn't
want to be in afghanistan
no matter what it took basically we got
out
the public
has made a lot of decisions this year
and they're not bad they're not bad
so good for the public
i'm watching some very very bad
political analysis happening and i have
to call it out
and this is where i get cancelled by my
own audience
please stop saying
oh democrats i guess the science changed
because now you want to get rid of the
mandates or the mass anyway
does that make sense to make fun of the
democrats and say oh i guess the science
was different last week when you wanted
maths but now the science has changed
does that make sense no no it doesn't
make sense
the data changed
the data changed
the science didn't change
you know whether the science is good or
bad it never changed
the data changed
and when the data changes do you keep
the same decision
of course not
so if all you're seeing is people saying
oh it looks like omicron's a new game
vaccinations have hit a certain rate
natural immunities here at a certain
rate
we're all going to get it
omicron seems to blast through
everything
all of the data is different
all the data might be wrong that's
another problem
but
please please it just i hate when people
who largely agree with me have bad
arguments because i feel like it makes
me look bad
and i do think that you all need to
protect your brand or your reputation
because it's important and i'd like to
do the same i i hate it when people act
as if time doesn't exist
there is a time to do something and a
time not to do it and if you do it when
the time is right
that doesn't mean you were wrong to not
do it when the time was wrong
all right now you could argue that it
was always the time to do it blah blah
blah but don't ignore the fact that the
reason things are different is because
the date is all different
that's that's something you shouldn't
ignore
um
and how about uh
so we're so here's how we're saying it
we're saying uh
the yonkin was wrong but now he's right
according to the democrats no
youngkin made a decision when the data
was
almost
overwhelmingly you know clear that we
needed to
reduce the mandates
he did it a little bit early
other people waited a few weeks
and then they said oh yeah it looks it
looks like we're safe
i don't really think that's a flip-flop
right now i do think that the
politicians are reacting to public
demand don't you
of course
so public demand is a new fact
that's a new fact
and part of the science which we've
always asked
the experts to look at is to look at all
the factors
don't look at
just the virus look at you know the
social impact the economic impact the
mental health impact all that right
so one of the new factors is the public
opinion if public opinion changed
that is a perfectly good reason for
governments to change we shouldn't be
criticizing them for changing
when we caused them to do the change
that's what we wanted
that was the whole point of it
um
all right
fusion
yet again another story about our
breakthrough infusion this one from the
uk
they more than doubled the previous
record for generating a sustaining
nuclear fusion now double doesn't mean
that there are economic
break even
but again it's an engineering problem
climate
change is kind of solved
i might be the the only person who's
willing to say that out loud
climate change as a
problem that's going to destroy the
world is already solved now we have to
implement it
but the solution is
nuclear traditional nuclear but the the
better type
modular nuclear
so you get the economics down and then
fusion eventually
these these might all be 10 20 year
things but that's
that's fine we'll be fine
and we also have the ability to
remediate whatever damage happens
between now and the time that we have
plenty of nuclear power
so if you look at the things that have
been solved
in the in the recent
last years we've all been so busy
just fighting for our lives in this
coveted world
there are a few things that you lose
sight of
climate change
basically solved
and why was it solved
because opinions changed
now technology changed too but mostly
opinions about traditional nuclear
development
why did the opinions change
well michael schellenberger was a big
big reason
maybe the biggest reason
mark schneider big reason very big
reason
you know i helped you helped
that was the people
do you think that the government made a
solution to climate
nope
greta tonberg a citizen
made a big deal about it
and then people like you and i
separately whether we were worried about
climate change or not we're making a big
deal about your you know nuclear needs
to be
part of the mix no matter what you think
because we just need the energy we can't
run out of energy
so you need it
so the the public solved climate change
not the scientists
think about that
it wasn't the scientists that solved
climate change of course the scientists
have to build the nuclear reactors
like they're they're not irrelevant but
in terms of the
movement of the strategy of the country
that was the people
the government did not convince the
people
did you see that happening it wasn't the
government that convinced the people to
do nuclear that never happened
it was literally the people who
convinced the government
and that happened really in the last two
years i'd say
that is remarkable
it's like freaking
unbelievable
the biggest problem in the world
the public solved it directly
by changing our opinions on the one
thing that could have solved it
so
that's happening now what what is the
outcome of the pandemic
one of the outcomes of the pandemic is
we really got a lot smarter about a lot
of stuff
right so you know we can mourn our
losses
let's not let's not lose sight that we
lost a lot of people
but
we learned a lot
and we probably will be able to get on
top of
maybe not just the common cold maybe
flus
maybe we've got a whole new set of tools
for everything
i mean medically we're way ahead
if the only thing that came with this
was dropping the state restriction about
telehealth
i mean that's pretty huge
there's a bunch of huge benefits that
came out of the pandemic in the same way
the huge benefits come out of a war
you don't want the war
but you do get radar out of it you know
you get a bunch of developments
you get the nuclear nuclear bomb if you
like that
so we've got
uh pandemics going in the right way
we've got how about homeschooling
homes are you watching corey d'angelis
just kill it
i mean he's just killing it
spreading the
homeschool message and reporting it back
and building up public support
so who was behind homeschooling
so what's the biggest what is the
biggest threat
uh let's say let's say what is the
biggest cause of uh systemic racism
biggest cause of systemic racism
the schools
the schools are bad if we had good
schools everywhere
then no matter what bad situation you
were born into your odds of having a
strategy out would be pretty good
just pay attention in school do your
homework
you'll be fine
but we don't have that
so now who solved the problem of the
schools being crappy
well it's not solved
but the public took over
because the teachers unions the
democrats et cetera just weren't going
to get it done so the people
decided that they would keep pushing for
these
fund the student instead of the system
and state after state after state
and corey d'angelos is a big part of
this i think
are lining him up and knocking him down
so there are more states
almost every day there's a new state
introducing legislation or passing
legislation to put funding in the in the
hands of the kids so they could take
their money and go to a private or just
a non-public school
so
the public did that
so the public
is working on and it's very lots of
progress on a solution to
systemic racism
now
let me play fair
do you mind
would you give me permission to say
something good about let's say
who who you think is the other side in
all likelihood based on my audience
why did we solve this school problem
well
mostly just to get better schools
and you know less crt and all that stuff
but i'm not sure if we hadn't had the
black lives movement
black lives matter
i'm not sure that we would have had as
much
energy to
um
to fix the school system
so again whether you're pro or con the
black lives matter messaging
it was the public
it was the public saying hey we think
there's a big systemic problem and then
who solved it
the public
it wasn't even the politicians i mean so
far it looks like the public just
pushing the politicians
to fix the schools
which are the biggest source of
racism
um
so we are in a really weird time right
now
and the weird time is this
we've fixed just about everything
or it's on the way to being fixed
this is one of the most optimistic
moments in history i've ever seen
but we you know because of the nature of
the news it's all doom and gloom and
we've lost our rights and russia's going
to war and stuff
but wow are we heading in the right
direction on everything
and we're we're freaking killing it
as human beings we just can't see it
because we're right in the middle of it
um
is mocking an effective form of
persuasion yes it is
yeah so i'm not going to say that uh
everything's fixed i'm going to say that
the public is moving in the right
direction on just about everything
and it's uh except you know the cancer
culture is out of control
but um i think but i do think the public
stepped up and saved
joe rogan and i think the public
um may have to take control of
cancellations too but but you know i
think the market may be taking care of
that itself
you know how long ago was it that there
could not have been a 100 million offer
from another platform for joe rogan
think about that
was it only
maybe
i don't know when rumble started but
probably they weren't big enough or
didn't have enough
momentum
that i would say two years ago joe rogan
would have had no
competing platform possibly
but now he does
so he's pro he's protected because the
not only has the public in a way in a
way the public is what created these
alternative platforms because they
couldn't have succeeded without a big
public
energy toward them
and so
the public found a way to push industry
to create safe spaces that
you can get canceled and still go make
money
so that's a big deal
now here's a topic that i saw in the
news that the government has recovered
some many millions of dollars that were
stolen
was six billion
that were stolen uh of bitcoin
to which you probably all said to
yourself what
how could you recover stolen bitcoin
you ever wonder that
because what about all that privacy
right
now
what was it three billion three billion
they recovered
so whatever the number was it was some
some big big number they recovered but
here's the part that surprised me
how did anybody ever think that crypto
was going to be private
why did we ever think that
because as long as you know who the
human is who has the crypto account you
can just force them to give you the
password
right there's some amount of jail
that will make anybody give you a
password
so
did we ever really have any kind of
privacy
because the government if if they have a
reason they can ask for it if they don't
have a reason well what's the difference
you hack the pc that accesses the wall
yeah
there got to be i'll bet there are
several
ways to get at somebody's crypto
uh and the government has the best one
they can control the human being and
then you control everything
all right
well i still think the big push for uh
bitcoin in particular is going to be
when the public decides that you have to
have some of it in your portfolio
how far are we from that
so this is the reason that i hold it i
hold it just as a diversification thing
so it's you know small part of the
portfolio but
the reason i hold it is that there's
gonna be a day it'll happen probably in
one year
where all the financial analysts will
start saying the same thing
well we don't know what's going to
happen with crypto but if you don't have
some
you better guess something
just a little bit
in case it becomes the only thing you
can spend
because one possibility
yeah this is sort of the
the uh the prepper in me
there is at least one possibility that
someday regular money will suddenly
dissolve
one way or another and the only thing
you have left is crypto
that could happen i don't think the odds
of that are very high
but that's why you diversify you're
you're trying to take care of all the
smaller odds you're not trying to
take care of one big one
um
30 grand for one bitcoin yeah
but that doesn't mean anything because
you could buy fractional fractional
bitcoin
um
yeah
uh so nassim talb has a black paper on
bitcoin
and predicts it will crash
well how hard is that to predict
let me let me make a prediction about
a financial instrument and it doesn't
even matter which one it is
uh i predict it will someday crash
because i'm magic do you know what else
will someday crash everything
do you think the the market will someday
crash yeah of course
do you think every company will someday
crash
so far
all of them gold sure someday
i think everything crashes
so uh i don't consider nasim talib
um
to be my
let's say he's not my guiding star
your mileage might differ
yeah there could be something that takes
out the internet but not
not cash money that's true but you want
to be protected either way
uh crypto will eventually be hacked as
computing power increases you say
i don't know
will the joe rogan stuff backfire on the
canceled crowd i don't think it'll
backfire
i think it just won't work
you know we should also talk about
people who are partially canceled
because i consider myself partially
cancelled
if you were to google me
uh if you never if you didn't know
anything about me
what do you think you would find out
about me if you googled me
think about this question
you had no prior conception you'd never
heard of me never heard my name
then you go online you say let's let's
figure out who this guy's about what
he's about and they google me
it's going to say i'm a right-wing
maga supporter
those two things are not true
it's going to say
that i'm a misogynist because of
something taken out of context
right
do you know what's the only thing it
won't say
it won't say i'm a racist
because so far somehow i've managed to
not fall into any of those traps
like that as far as i know i don't think
there's anything on the internet that
would say that
now usually those are something taken
out of context or whatever but i don't
think i even said anything that could be
taken out of context amazingly
amazingly it's hard to do
but amazingly
so i think i'm only being accused of
other things
you milk toast
all right
so i would say that i'm canceled in the
sense that my public reputation is
destroyed
if i didn't already have you know a
career so i don't have to worry about
money
i couldn't get a job
do you know how hard it would be to get
a job with my social media
record
it'd be pretty hard
i don't think any employer would want to
take me on
you know unless it was somebody who
mistakenly thought that the
that the accusations were true and they
liked it
what brand is your shirt
i think it's an untucker
now can you see
what does that say
yeah i'm talking
i couldn't remember for a moment
uh you can get a job of your skill well
i'm i'm exaggerating a little bit but my
point is
can you imagine any human resources
group looking at my uh
my public record
and saying we've got to get this guy on
board i don't think it would happen
maybe a ceo could do it but the hr
department would say it looks like
trouble
yeah i could work for my pillow
and buy slippers
did you keep the vans or did you buy
shoes for adults i kept the vans
actually it was complimented on them
i've never been complimented on my
footwear before
but uh randomly complimented
all right
uh oh i can i could merchandise uh
t-shirts and uh and coffee
that's not a bad idea
i should i should do t-shirt
merchandise all right that's all for now
i've gotta go do some things
and
i hope you're buying into my concept
that things are really really heading in
the right direction we're not there a
lot of work to do but the work is
getting done and so congratulations to
all of you
literally
sincerely congratulations
you
public
have had a great year
i mean you're killing it you're just
totally killing it in the last year
so good on you and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
