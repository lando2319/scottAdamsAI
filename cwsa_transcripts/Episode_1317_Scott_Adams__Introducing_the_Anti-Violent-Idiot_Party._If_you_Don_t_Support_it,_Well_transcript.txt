hey everybody
i forgot to tweet this morning about
this uh live stream
so we may not have as many people on
here for a while
come on in come on in it's just us for
now
if you'd like to make this a special
time
and i'm talking about more special than
it already is and it's pretty darn
special i think you'd agree
all you need is a copper mug of glass
tank of chelsea stein a canteen
juggerflask vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes
everything better even when you've got a
collar on your shirt
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's about to happen now
all over the world at the same time go
all right don't make fun of me about my
collared shirt
there's a reason doesn't matter
all right here's the news so
now our experts are telling us that six
feet of social distance
may be overkill and that maybe just
maybe
three feet is good enough a lot of
people are quite reasonably saying
uh and no i'm not i'm not wearing shoes
and i'm still wearing pajamas
the bottom half is there's all pajamas
and bare feet
but it turns out that uh there was no
data for the six foot
guidance we originally had do you think
therefore that the experts did a bad job
because they said six feet of distance
when
three feet was good enough probably or
at least there's no data to say six is
better to which i say
no remember in the beginning of the
pandemic
everybody was guessing everybody
the experts were guessing the leaders
were guessing the public was guessing
everybody was guessing so i don't hold
the experts responsible for
guessing that six feet was safer than
three
if you don't know it's pretty reasonable
isn't that pretty reasonable doesn't
your common sense say
how far does your spindle go it
definitely goes three feet
i don't know if my spindle goes six feet
but it definitely goes three
i can hit you right here stand there and
see if you can feel my spray
so i think that was reasonable six feet
i think was totally reasonably good
sense that the entire six feet didn't
make much difference
dan bongino got picked for the to
fill in for the spot that rush limbaugh
left with his passing and a
person a person who if you looked at any
one of his
individual how much how much
discrimination
i mean i don't know how you measure such
things but i don't think anybody thinks
it's not
they not only overcome it but they crush
it
right i think i can say that isn't that
a fair statement
that the asian american communities have
been unusually successful
despite unusually high discrimination
so they kind of ruined the whole uh hard
work doesn't work
theory um
so let's talk more about this because
there's a larger picture that's
that's coming together so i'm going to
give you a bunch of
individual stories but then we're going
to tie them together into this beautiful
quilt
so wait for the beautiful quilt part
i'm looking at the comments and people
are obsessed by me finally wearing a
nice shirt
let me ask you this should i wear a nice
shirt every day
because i'm genuinely curious about this
i feel as if
wearing the actual shirt i woke up in
you know my pajamas is more casual
oh a lot of no's let's see i got one yes
a lot of no sure yes sure
no be comfy no well okay then knows when
there you go the decision is made the
audience has spoken
uh we're going to go back to uh maximum
comfort
because that's how the simultaneous sip
was meant to be
all right you got it casual it is
tomorrow all right
so i'll go through a number of anecdotes
and then we'll tie them together into a
tapestry so wikileaks is reporting
that the reason trump won or at least
one of them is that clinton used
media contacts in other words she used
the
the news to which she had closed ties
to elevate trump during during the
primary
and it even had a name it was called the
pied piper strategy
and now there's actually documents where
you can read the democrats actual
strategy
and it's funny to actually read it
because it's stuff you suspect
maybe they were you know maybe they were
thinking that way but then you read it
and it's
it's detailed and it says directly that
their strategy was
to in the in the primaries anyway in
2016
to promote these three candidates cruz
trump and carson because they would be
seen as too extreme they would drive all
the other candidates to the left
which would ruin the republican party
and that
ultimately they would end up electing
somebody for the general
who could not get elected but what they
didn't count on
what they didn't count on is the last
thing you want to do
is give trump extra energy
because trump as i've often said is an
energy monster
you could call it anti-anti-fragile
maybe
i don't know if that really fits but
if you give ben carson lots of attention
does he become a better can today or
does it
start to highlight maybe some suboptimal
things about his policies or whatever
i don't know that carson was an energy
monster right
how about ted cruz
very capable one of my favorite
politicians just
in in terms of pure talent ted cruz is
among the top
um but he's not an energy monster
meaning that if you give ted cruz more
attention
does he become more popular you know to
some extent everybody does but it's got
to be a matter of degree right
but then look at trump what happens when
you send
more energy toward trump
he uses it trump actually
he it's like he's an energy monster
meaning that he takes the energy that
you're sending him
he you know he reforms it and then he
sends it out in another direction that
benefits him
who else does that
let me name some names mike cernovich
mike cernovich is an energy monster the
more energy you send to mike cernovich
the more he will reform it
send it out the way he wants to and get
stronger
who else is an energy monster
me me by technique i don't know if it's
something you're born with or if it's
technique it looks more like technique
actually
but the more energy people send my way
you've watched it right in front of you
right you've seen it with your own eyes
i reform the energy into the form i want
and then i send it out the way i want it
not everybody's an energy monster it's
kind of aoc somebody's saying in the
comments yeah
aoc is an energy monster every time
somebody says
watch this great criticism we have about
aoc
this will take her down and they send
that energy toward her
she reforms it sends it out the way she
wants it
she's an energy monster never use the
pied piper strategy
on an energy monster
big mistake right somebody says jordan
peterson
in a way i think i'll accept that one
he's
a different kind of character bill burr
good example
bill burr is an energy monster he causes
controversy
people say we're going to cancel this
guy they send all this energy toward
bill burr
and bill burr says chop chop chop chop
chop chop reform
here you go who made me a little bit
richer
candace owens perfect example yeah
so you start to recognize the energy
monsters right
how about this one pierce morgan
right pierce morgan not only walked off
his show
and it dropped by thirty percent but as
of today
the news says it went down to another
hundred thousand viewers
he he took forty percent off of the
profits and uh well forty percent off of
the traffic
for his network just by walking off
he's an energy monster all that energy
and hate went toward
pierce morgan and he said
boom there you go 40 percent of your
audience just walked off
how many job offers did pierce morgan
get in the last week
well i don't know but i'll bet they're
pretty profitable looking
because if you can make 40 percent of
your audience disappear
just by walking off you can get a very
big
offer for your next job because it means
you have obviously a following
so that's the first story the first
story is that wikileaks says
that the clinton strategy was definitely
to promote these characters
and also them to promote their extremism
making them look like racists
so here's the first part of the story we
know it's documented
that the clinton strategy was to use
their media
their friendly media to paint the
republicans as
extremists which really means racists
right
that's part one now let's get to current
news
these will seem like separate stories
until i tie them together
there's a anecdotally we're seeing you
know lots of stories of uh specific anti
what looks like anti-asian uh racism
when there's a video today of a uh some
gym
fitness guy who was yelling at a woman
in traffic you know
they were in their cars and at one point
he gets out of his car and he's
yelling uh stuff and blaming her for the
wuhan
virus etc so you're saying racist stuff
and she's recording him with her camera
and then you see the fitness guy who's
threatening her and saying
uh racist stuff you see him say
you know recording doesn't do anything
recording doesn't do anything
and i said to myself i don't think
racism is the problem here
because she recorded him in 2021
what happens when you record somebody
saying racist things in 2021.
she killed him she used her
phone and killed him
right because we knew his name within
minutes
i mean that thing shows up on a viral
video
we know his name he's cancelled
right her phone was as powerful as a gun
not in the death kind but in the in his
uh let's say his social and
economic life she just killed him and i
don't give a at all
do you i don't care that she killed him
he had it coming
he started it he started the fight she
just ended it
she freaking killed him with a phone
20 21. here you go so
what do you think about that guy do you
say to yourself well there's an example
of
a racist well yes yes
there's no doubt that you could label
him a racist based on what we saw in the
video
he was saying unambiguously racist stuff
but isn't there a sort of a larger story
that's sort of peeking out
that maybe he was i'm going to do a
little cursing do you mind
because they might mind if i do a little
cursing because there there's an f word
that needs to
flavor this story and it just needs a
little flavoring
okay when this guy said
you know recording doesn't do anything
he revealed that in addition to being a
racist and i don't think anybody could
doubt this
he's a idiot because recording
him saying racist stuff
ended his his life basically
so here's a guy who somehow in 2021
didn't realize that being recorded
saying racist stuff in public was going
to work against his self-interest that's
not a racist
just i mean he's also racist it's kind
of a idiot problem isn't it
the guy was a idiot now he
happened to be white
or this might be provocative but
and i'm not sure if you know the answer
to this but are all
 idiots white
i don't know i mean i read the news and
it sounds like they are
but i don't think it's true i would like
to think that the
the population of idiots is
somewhat distributed
i would like to think it's not
concentrated in one ethnicity
i mean i haven't noticed that it is the
news says it is but i don't think so
so hold that hold the
that story now put together the
following things you got the pied piper
strategy
where the democrats work with the press
to make republicans look like racists
that's now documented
all right and it's documented as a
strategy
as opposed to a truth it's documented as
manipulation and propaganda
by definition that remember the find
people hoax
where you had these people who again
appeared on camera
carrying torches and saying racist stuff
but when the president talked about it i
mean the the racists were real
but when the president talked about it
if there's anybody new to my live stream
i hope all of you know by now that the
fine people thing was a hoax right
the president never said there were fine
people uh on the racist side he
clarified i'm not talking about the
racists
they're they should be disowned but the
hoax is created by cutting out that part
where he says
i'm not talking about the races they
just cut that part out and then it looks
like he is talking about the races
so that's how the hoax was perpetuated
so
that fits into the pied piper strategy
doesn't it
so once you see that the democrats
working with the press
had an actual strategy the fine people
hoax fits right into it doesn't it
now now you can start seeing now that
you've seen the strategy
i'll start filling in the parts and you
can see how well it worked
find people hoax worked very well now
you see the cnn
is trying to cancel abraham lincoln
and they're running stories and writing
articles about how his
his racial opinions were let's say
complicated
and they're trying to make him out that
maybe he was a little bit racist
a little bit racist now i would think
that by modern standards that's true
he probably was i mean i think that just
be an obvious thing to say
that you could pick really anybody from
that era
just anybody even somebody who was
famous for being an abolution
abolitionist
probably they were racist compared to
modern standards
so canceling lincoln what do you think
is the point of that
do you think that they're running this
because it's interesting
is that why cnn said what's the most
interesting thing we can do
that's not uh current so it's a
historical thing
that our audience would be interested in
of all the things that we could talk
about in all of history
and by the way cnn does really good
historical shows they do a great job on
those
i really enjoy them but why was it they
picked lincoln
do you think now part of it is because
the statues were coming down
and then and then some places were being
renamed that had lincoln in the name so
he was a little bit in the news
but it seems to me that there's a bigger
play here
which is that lincoln is
lincoln is the uh escape valve
for white for accusations of white
racism
lincoln is sort of the get in a jail
card
so if you say hey you white people are
all racists
you did slavery you did you know however
many decades
of racial discrimination white people
are bad
but then there was lincoln and lincoln
was a white person who's
revered who is most famous
for freeing the slaves so he's kind of
like a problem white guy right because
he doesn't fit the narrative
do you know who else doesn't fit the
narrative successful
asian americans do you start now watch
the pattern start to come together
so here are just two points now two
points can draw a line but it doesn't
really mean it's a pattern
you can easily see false patterns so
two things that look like kind of
similar taking out the
taking out the counter arguments right
asian americans being successful is a
counter argument to the narrative that
everything is about race
and abe lincoln is a counter-argument to
all white people are racists because he
freed the slaves
so if you take out the hero and you take
out the asian american counter example
you'll start to i'm not done yet then
you add the find people hoax
start to see it come together the pied
piper strategy
and now we see that the especially the
new york times
uh leading the the call trying to make
these anecdotal situations where there
is a white person who did do
a real damage and violence to asian
americans
to make it sort of a white supremacist
narrative
and so now we have this situation where
the
uh young white guy killed a bunch of
people in massage parlors most of them
were asian
american or asian i don't know if they
were american but i think they were
asian american
and and the narrative
is that it's racist except when they
talk to the guy
he doesn't have any racial motivation
he said that he was a sex addict
basically he had a sexual
obsession and he thought that the
massage parlors were
you know making it too easy for his
addiction now basically he's just a
crazy
guy right just a crazy guy
but they're going to make it they're
going to try to turn it into it's got to
fit into the narrative
as part of the all white people are bad
and
are hating asian americans just like
trump
because of calling that a china virus
instead of just a virus
and then it goes to the
extra absurd level because the sheriff
who was talking about this case
um georgia sheriff
they nodded they found that he once made
a china virus joke
in social media so this is the cop who's
handling it and talking about it
so now he's canceled because he once
made a china virus
joke online now
he didn't say chinese virus
because chinese would be the people he
said china the country
which is literally the death
the starting point like other viruses
that were named after places
doesn't look racist to me right it looks
republican but it doesn't look racist
so they throw that in there because
they've got to smear this guy because
he's white
and then then they go after him for what
he said
so he was talking about this the
perpetrator having
essentially mental illness not
essentially he has mental illness
obviously
and that on the day of the shooting he
was having a quote bad day
now the context was this was somebody
who was on the edge mentally
and then there was one day that pushed
him over the edge does that sound racist
what i just said there was a there was a
person with mental illness
and then one day he got pushed over the
edge
not at all right it's not even a little
bit racist
but i'll just word it the way this guy
worded it
that he said you know things have been
going poorly for him and then he had a
bad day
all the sheriff is talking about is that
he was pushed over the edge that day
that's all
that turned racist because saying it was
a bad day
minimizes the fact that he slaughtered
six uh
asian or asian-american women i don't
know if they were asian or very
asian-american
but
that's not there that this is just
making some stuff
up i've been eating some chinese food
somebody says stop lying scott
well let me solve your problem
look at that i blocked you and you won't
hear even one more lie
good for you all right
um and then of course the capital
protests
were have been uh you know hammered into
the narrative that it has a white
supremacist element to it
and what exactly was that what exactly
was the white supremacist element of the
capital
riot there were probably some people
there who were white supremacists
do you think that any uh group of
protesters does not have
some criminals in it and some pedophiles
and some
rapists and some murderers sometimes
i would guess that any large group of
americans
has a good smattering of pretty bad
people in it
all right so here's my take putting it
all together you can see that there's a
a tapestry here in which the media
is creating a story of white supremacy
as
the problem in the united states and
they're forcing all these anecdotal
things in there
and the way human brains are organized
we
will easily see this pattern if they
keep telling us it's there
and so of course people are so largely
the
and the uh the concern about anti-asian
racism is real of course very real
um but it's now part of the narrative to
make white people diminished
and and the republicans who
were in that category to diminish them
as well
all right and it's amazing to watch
this develop so here's
here's what i'm feeling as a targeted uh
person
so i would say that i'm in the target
group meaning that
as a successful older white male
i'm kind of the enemy now you know i
must be the cause of all problems and
just being in my demographic group makes
me a problem
and i would like to not be seen as a
problem so i would suggest
the following i'm going to start a new
political party
we're not going to do any paperwork so
we're just
it's a conceptual party sort of like um
have you noticed the genius of antifa
we've talked about this before
they say we're antifa we're
anti-fascists
so if you're against us what are you
a fascist so cleverly antifa came up
with a name
that makes everybody who attacks them a
bad person
which was pretty brilliant now take
black lives matter
if you don't agree with the statement
black lives matter
and you say anything that sounds racist
to the people who get to define you as
racist like hey
all lives matter whoa ho ho ho you
racist
don't come in here with your all lives
matter stuff that's pretty bad
now from a persuasion perspective both
antifa and black lives matter really did
a good job
you might not like it but they really
did a good job with coming up with names
and slogans
because their names and slogans are
weaponized
pretty darn good and they both did it
and it both worked
so here's the party that i'm gonna start
it's called the
anti-violent idiot party
because there are a lot of violent
idiots in the world
many of them are white and so why
have you noticed that there are many
violent idiots in the world
and a lot of them are white
gotta say a lot of them are black
a lot of them are hispanic american a
lot of them
are europeans there are a lot of
there are a lot of violent idiots in the
world
but i'm anti-violent idiot and i would
say that when i look at say
cnn's framing of
white people as the problem i would say
they're promoting violence
ultimately and that they're
yeah it's the avi party anti-violent
idiot
so that every time somebody takes one of
these anecdotes
like this guy who shot up the massage
parlors and tries to turn it into a
racial story
you say oh i'm against you guys because
you guys are trying to start a race war
and if starting a race war would be an
idiot thing to do
because all the people who are the
citizens don't know that their opinions
have been assigned to them
and they've been assigned
the opinion that white people are white
supremacists
and must be stopped so
anybody who has that opinion is an idiot
and they're a little bit violent in my
opinion because even if they're not
doing the violence
i think we all agree that speech can be
violence
if the speech sort of promotes violence
right sort of a continuum
you know if the if the speech is what
directly causes the violence
well then the speech is part of that
violence right
so i would say that the uh the main
narrative that the
press is uh spreading
which is that white supremacy is a
problem for the
anti-asian racism is
a violent idiot problem
not only are the press
violent idiots because they're framing
this
in the most unproductive way to cause a
race war
what could be what could be dumber than
intentionally causing a race war in the
united states
like raise your hand and can you think
of anything dumber
i mean i know raising taxes 200
might be dumber but we're not really
talking about it of the things we're
actually considering
what would be dumber than that can you
think of anything
what would be dumber or more violent
in the way that words are violent
than framing everything as a racial
problem nothing there's actually nothing
dumber than that
so i'm anti-violent idiots
so stop calling me white
because you know what i don't do when i
see a story about some
white people who let's say invented
something
or or were successful here's what i
don't do
wow look at those white people go
never once never once have i said
man i'm feeling proud now because i'm
white
and complete strangers who have nothing
to do with me
who are also white did something cool
on the other side of the country yay me
i've never done that they just look like
different people
so i choose not to be
labeled by my group and if you label me
my my group and throw me in there and
say
i'm part of systemic racism
you're a violent idiot you're not a
racist
you're actually just an idiot because a
racist
would have a little more thinking
at least the racist is being selfish
right
the racist actually has a philosophy
of selfishness i want everything for me
and
bad for them or they might have a belief
that they're superior or something but
it would be at least a philosophy
the violent idiots don't have anything
they're just violent
and idiots so i'm anti-violent idiot
you can be on my party no matter your
ethnicity
no matter anything there's no
restriction you just have to be
not a violent idiot so anybody who wants
to make everything look like a racial
problem
is a violent idiot because you're
leading to violence
and you're very very dumb and
let me say this as clearly as possible
the violent idiots for the most part
are not people who made up their own
minds they're not
they're people whose opinions have been
assigned to them
and their brains are so weak because
they're idiots
that they just accept the the narrative
and run with it
all right um
antiva somebody says avi
all right that's my uh take on that
let's see what else is going on
there's a 3d printed community being
built
in rancho mirage so they're building an
upscale community this won't be for
like cheap little 3d printed homes
so they're building a 1450 square foot
single story homes
made from stone composite materials
that's strong and fire resistant and
water resistant and termite proof
and and all that and it's uh let's see
the polari group
is doing it now here's what's
interesting about this
uh they say they can make these homes
far cheaper
and um instead of you've seen the 3d
printer that's like a giant arm
and it's just printing the the entire
house
i always thought that was a bad idea
because if you wanted to change the
house and you always do
eventually it's like this 3d printed
thing like
how are you going to add a new window
what carve it
i mean it just didn't seem like a good
model
but this company is using 3d but it
looks like what they're doing is
off-site or maybe on-site i don't know
they're they're making panels
so instead of just 3d the entire thing
they're 3d in the parts and then the
parts are assembled
more and more or less in a traditional
way
so if you needed to change it later
you just remove a part so that would be
different so i think
i think that they have a better model
and i think they're 3d printing even
cabinetry and i don't know maybe maybe
faucets who knows but uh let's keep an
eye on this
so it looks like it would only bring
down the price maybe 25 percent
which is good enough for a really good
business
but um i think that ultimately housing
could be reduced by 90 percent
so there there's my uh prediction
housing costs
could be almost with our current
technology but maybe with a little
little extra technology i think housing
costs could be reduced
90 and that we will need to
because there's no way we can survive as
a civilization
unless we do you can't survive as a
civilization
when 80 percent of your people can't
afford a home
right that's just not going to work
so the border crisis continues um
i saw something that tucker uh
carlson said and he was referring to the
people who make the
um dangerous and arduous trip across the
border
the the migrants or the immigrants eddie
i think you referred to them
if i remember the words like the the
boldest and most
ambitious and i thought to myself
we've accidentally created a
filter with immigration
that is surprisingly good accidentally
surprisingly good i've always said this
about the united states
that one of our biggest advantages is
that the people who came here first
the original founders and pilgrims and
all that
were self-self-filtered
there were people who said to themselves
i'm going to
sail across this ocean very dangerous to
a whole new place
very dangerous that's already owned by
the native americans
very dangerous we don't we don't have
any homes there there's nothing there
it's just going to be
land and we're going to figure it out
right if if all the people who were
willing to take that risk
and were capable enough healthy enough
to survive it
smart enough to make it work haven't you
sort of self-selected really capable
people
who are likely to be entrepreneurial
because whatever it is that causes you
to leave your country and go across an
ocean to a new world
is it's got to be close in type to
whatever makes you an entrepreneur
so don't you end up with a whole bunch
of people who are self-selected to be
bold and entrepreneurial and didn't the
united states
grow up with that dna i mean that no
matter what the ethnicity was or where
they came from
we were skimming off the boldest
most capable now they didn't have to
necessarily be the highest iq
but that's not everything about success
right success is also about risk-taking
uh your your mental approach your
optimism
and all those things and how to feel now
obviously bad people get
get into right i'm not going to minimize
the fact that bad people get into the
country
so can we stipulate will everybody be
happy if i stipulate
that open immigration lets lots of bad
people into the country
if you will also accept my other point
which is that the vast majority of
people have this weird characteristic
which is they're pretty brave pretty
brave
they're also resourceful they're also
ambitious
they're also looking for a better life
and they're also willing to work hard
what's that say about the future of the
united states
now i know the people with you know who
are racist are saying wait a minute
you know uh you're bringing in the lower
quality
uneducated people how could that be good
first generation there's something to be
said to that right because they might be
bringing in
less education than is the average so on
average it would look like it's lowering
the average but wait a generation
we are filtering the boldest
the most ambitious the most hardworking
people
are all coming here if you don't think
that's going to pay off
i don't know how well you understand
economics
and so my main point here is this where
are the economists
in this discussion i feel like the
entire profession of economists just
took a vacation
when it's this is the thing the very
thing they should be dealing with
which is how much and what kind of
immigration is the healthiest
because i'm watching a comment somebody
says
oh my god this guy is brainwashed i'll
bet he has an asian wife
i don't
um let me let me say this if your
sense of me is that i'm brainwashed and
crazy
you're experiencing cognitive dissonance
which is the things i'm saying do make
sense
but it disagrees with you and it's
causing you some distress
and you're trying to explain your world
that no longer makes sense and there are
two ways you can explain it
one is that there was something wrong
with the way you were thinking before
or two there's something wrong with me
one of those is more likely to be true
they can both be true
but one of them is more likely to be
true and
if you're having this feeling that's
sort of like this generic bad feeling
that's like this guy is crazy or this
guy must be lying
or this guy must be paid by russia or
anything like that
then you're experiencing cognitive
dissonance and that's how you know
because your your objection doesn't have
a specific reason that just stands right
now
you just feel like i must have an asian
wife or something
or or maybe somebody's paying me
if if you're having any of those
thoughts that is cognitive dissonance
and good luck with that
so the economist should be weighing in
and the economist should be telling us
this they should say
under our current conditions which is
you know still recovering from the
pandemic
uh current employment rates current
everything current gdp
take that all into account how much
employment do we need
et cetera consider our demographic
trajectory which is too many old people
but younger people are coming into the
country
so backfilling the older people with
youth is good where is that not
happening
japan not happening right
so there are countries that have a real
big problem because they have more old
people than young people
the united states would have that
problem too but were accidentally
solving it by bringing
a lot of young people over the border
now where is the economist
republican or democrat or both ideally
who get together and say look given all
this the right amount of immigration
from let's say the southern border
is x people per year because i'll tell
you what the right number is not
the right number is not zero is it
and i don't think the right number is 10
million a year
is it but if it's not 10 million a year
and it's not zero people a year who gets
to decide what it is
shouldn't the economist weigh in on this
shouldn't
an economist say look for example
shouldn't the economist be telling us i
think we can handle
i'll just put a number on it a hundred
thousand per year i think it's a lot
bigger
but let's say a hundred thousand now
let's let's bump it up
our economy given the size of the
country
probably need a minimum of
i'll just throw in a number just top of
my head four hundred thousand a year
we probably need something like four
hundred thousand immigrants a year
maybe it's a million maybe it's more i
don't know could be more than a million
actually
that would be uh optimal economic
situation
they see somebody going no now
who would be against let me just ask the
question
who would be opposed let's say the
economists were right
i don't know how likely that would be
but let's say the economists were right
and that the number of people they said
should come in
doesn't have to be a million whatever
that number is uh
and we let in that number of people are
you worse off
do you feel that you would be worse off
if we let in exactly the number of
people the economists say
will make us stronger
how would you be worse off somebody says
too many people
traffic you know i think the too many
people traffic problem may be working
itself out
because the cities are getting
depopulated and if you take away rush
hour
you don't have the traffic problem right
because non-non-rush hour traffic
except for la is not that bad
all right um so i think the economists
have something to
uh explain about why they're missing
from this conversation
because you and i don't know how many
people should come over
if you and i are arguing about that we
have too many people coming or too few
based on what based on what
how could you say that there are too
many people coming
it feels like too many right like
you just your common sense you see the
pictures and you see all these people
coming over and then you look at our
unemployment rate
you say wait a minute there's no way
this is good
all those people still have unemployment
plus you know the coronavirus makes
everything worse
you and i don't have the information to
know whether this is good or bad
or what level would be good or bad i
would i would agree with your
and here's where i say by the way if it
sounded like i'm
uh for open immigration
i'm not i'm for data i'm for knowing how
much
is the right amount and i'm definitely
for having a strong border
because the stronger your border is the
more you control you have over what is
the right amount
you know open the door bigger when you
need more close a little bit when you
need less
so we should be treating the the border
like a valve
that sometimes we open sometimes we
close just depends on the economics
right and and why is there no leader
explaining it to you like i just did
i imagine if you will democrat or
republican
all right so if i run for president this
is how i'll do it
i'm going to say this isn't a republican
democrat
question is an economic question
the economic health of the united states
requires some amount of immigration of
some type
let's figure out what is the right
amount build a strong
border and then only let in that amount
and as we need more open it up as we
need fewer
close down that's how i'd handle it
that's the that's called the high ground
approach and would make anybody
president if they ever use that approach
nobody will putin is interesting
so i guess joe biden had said that putin
was
a killer with no soul
and putin responded by wishing joe biden
good health
i wish you good health russian president
said
now what could be scarier
than vladimir putin wishing you good
health
i don't know if i've heard a scarier
threat
in my whole life because putin
actually kills people right in front of
you with poisoning
he poisoned you know he has his critics
poisoned right in front of the world
so he is literally a mass murderer
in public he's like smiling mass murder
and biden called them out which is fair
uh and then the biggest mass murderer
who is also
the head of a country says
i wish you good health
take care be well
that's the scariest thing i've ever
heard in my life
oh my god i mean it almost sounds like
putin's
is getting ready to like poison biden or
something
hey i wish you good health
enjoy your beverages when you're eating
your dinner tonight
don't think about all the people i've
poisoned for being my critic
no no enjoy your food tonight
that's what it sounded like to me uh
canada
i love canada um
not only do i like canada because
canadians are so damn nice
which is just true by the way like there
there are some uh
you know there's some like uh
generalizations that
just don't seem fair but one of the
generalizations that's just always fair
is that canadians are nice
they're nice but this move had me
laughing
so as you know in the news the
astrazeneca oxford corona
virus vaccine is being rejected by a
number of european countries because
they have anecdotal stories of people
who had
blood clots now the data says that there
are no more blood clots
with the vaccine than without so there's
literally
zero data to suggest that this vex
the specific vaccination type is
dangerous and yet european countries are
banning it
canada is sitting over there saying
what what
yes canada there's a shortage of
vaccines
and any country that could get more of
the vaccines
would be in good shape but there's a
serious shortage
however there's not as much of a
shortage
on the one that the violent idiots in
europe i'll just
call them violent idiots for fun believe
is uh going to kill
them with blood clots so the canadians
are over here
seriously is europe really being that
stupid
they're going to give us all these
vaccines because basically that
that frees up a lot of supply right and
the canadians are like
let's just play this kind of quietly and
we're not going to make a big deal about
it we don't we don't want to say unkind
things but
i'm just saying that over here maybe
we're
going to use this vaccine
so thumbs up to canada for seeing an
opening
and driving a truck through it that was
funny
and and why why didn't we do this was
there some reason that
the united states can't have this uh
vaccine as well
where is biden saying oh yeah give us
some of that too if you've got some
extra left over because
because europe doesn't want it send it
our way so i think biden's asleep on the
switch on this
so canada i mean it's just so funny
this is such a candidate move
the the i would say the signature move
of canada
is that they they find an advantage
that doesn't seem to hurt anybody else
it's just so canadian it's just
hilarious
all right biden got fact checked by
cnn's
daniel dale i guess he had several
several statistical facts that were way
off
but none of them are really fun he he
likes to confuse millions and billions
which should worry you because biden
often says
he said something about was 700 and he
said something was almost 800 billion
but turns out it was 750 million
so biden is all confused in his numbers
i can't wait for his first
press conference so we all talked about
the deep fake biden video
that is allegedly not a deep fake it's
actually him
and you know the one i'm talking about
where his hand seems to cut the plane of
a microphone
that seems impossible it's on both sides
of the microphone and
just can't happen and i saw a fact check
on that
saying that it's not a deep fake and the
way you can tell
is that the angle from other cameras
shows the microphones and the hand and
so therefore you can tell it's
it's not a deep fake but
that doesn't quite explain what we're
seeing on the video does it
i now i get the fact that other camera
angles show there's nothing weird going
on
but why does the one camera angle show
the weird thing
because that's not explained the only
explanation is that the other cameras
don't show something
but it doesn't explain why this one
camera does
so i don't think it's a green screen
but it's a fun story
uh rasmussen is reporting that 64
percent
of uh in the poll i guess they found out
that 64
of likely u.s voters say they oppose tax
increases
to which i say to myself who answers a
poll saying they like
tax increases
isn't this one of those questions where
it kind of depends how you ask it
because if you ask me do i like a tax
increase
i think the answer has to be no every
time
now if you said to me would you like a
tax increase
if what we were going to do with that
money was
x y and z then i would say to you oh
okay there's some costs there's some
benefits i'll weigh them
and i'll decide which one is more but if
your question is
what do you think about a tax increase
sort of open-ended
i don't like a tax increase if i'm only
looking at the cost
how would you like to give me a thousand
dollars for nothing
i don't like that i don't like that at
all oh i left out the part
where i'm gonna sell you my car oh
oh if you took a thousand dollars from
me and you gave me your used car
that might be okay but if it's just the
thousand dollars
i don't like that at all so i don't
think that people can answer a question
about
how they like tax increases because they
don't know the detail they don't know
what they're agreeing to basically
um but it is worth
noting that now we have biden is on the
other side of
immigration from the public and he's on
the other side of tax increases from the
public
and way on the other side on both issues
so um how long can biden
do things which three-quarters or
two-thirds of the country
oppose i've got a feeling that biden
might end up being one of the least
popular
presidents of all time except for his
clever trick
of not appearing much in public what has
happened do you think to
trump's popularity by staying out of the
news
i'll bet it's improving that is
improving
what's happening to biden's popularity
by staying out of the news
it's improving i mean it's staying high
it's sky high
so there may be something to the fact
that the less people see of you or let
me
let me put this way i think the optimal
situation is the highest level of name
recognition
with the lowest level of current
exposure so i'm working on this
hypothesis
that to become president that's your
perfect situation
the most name recognition with the least
daily attention because the
the nature of the news is criticism if
things are going well there's no news to
that
so the more you're in the news the more
you're being criticized
if you're already famous you're not
getting more famous
so there's no benefit from the extra
attention it's only extra criticisms
so i think that might be the only way to
become president so if i ran for
president
the strategy would be the same which
would be
i have reasonably high name recognition
most people have heard of the
comic strip at least so i would have
high name recognition
and i would barely ever appear in public
i wouldn't even do campaigning i
wouldn't do a
a stump speech i would do
maybe one interview a week i would take
questions from the public and the press
i would do a real
thorough like press conference kind of
thing
and that's it and then you wouldn't see
me again for six days
and everybody would say damn it he's
running for president where is he let's
say
i'm home well what are you doing i don't
know usually what i do usually
nothing different but one day a week
you're going to get to see me
i feel like that's the formula that
works now because of the nature of the
news
you want to be famous but not in the
news
so
yeah and you're seeing kamala harris is
following the same pattern
kamala harris is basically just
invisible
and that definitely works in her favor
because she's got the weird cackle and
anything she does is going to
invite criticism so she's just going to
be that name that gets mentioned a lot
but not in any important way
um will the stock market crash if he
quits
you mean biden no i don't think the
stock market would crash
um that's how led zeppelin
developed his aura of mystery and vague
menace in the 70s by avoiding the press
somebody says this is all so damn
ridiculous
it is
you know i would be the only person who
ran for president
by uh telling you all of my personal
faults
that i think the most politicians run
for president
by hiding and minimizing their faults i
don't think i would do that
because that feels like it feels like
that's just going to cause trouble later
i would rather run for president telling
you all my faults and if somebody has
some extra ones throw them on too
if i can't win the presidency
with all of my faults you know my
personal mistakes or
anything i've done in the past if i
can't win anyway
then i shouldn't be president so i'm not
even going to fight that stuff
i'm going to let you know
i'm just going to let gonna let you know
all the bad stuff
and then i'll tell you how it would
handle the job i would tell you the
systems i would use the
the transparency i would bring how i
would do public debates that i managed
in front of the public
and i would just tell you the system i'd
use and that's it
somebody says too many voters wouldn't
get it and you'd lose
well
[Music]
i would say that falls into the category
of how well you execute
there are lots of things that look like
bad bad ideas or good ideas and all that
matters is how well you executed
so i don't believe there are too many
people who could execute
the strategy that i just described but
i'm one of them
you know there's some specific people
who could pull that off
and i'm one of them
uh location value can i explain it to
you i don't understand that
some of your comments seem so off target
a high percentage of voters vote purely
on party lines
exactly do you know why do you know that
i would do them
i would run as a democrat
i would run as a democrat because
my greatest base of support is
republican
right so that would be the right
strategy
because i've said from the beginning i'm
left of bernie just better at math
meaning that i like the systems that
republicans favor
but i like the goals of having you know
a fair
good life for everybody that the
democrats are much better at expressing
you know they're far better expressing
where we want to be
but they're way worse at expressing how
to get there
and i would just take the best things
from the two parties
put them together the public would be
arguing all day long if i'm a democrat
or a republican
they would be arguing all day is he
really a democrat
because i why was he so pro-trump that
can't be and then the republicans would
be
well i thought he was sort of on our
side but then he's running as a democrat
and that doesn't make any sense
but why are his policies not so democrat
how could he be a democrat
if he doesn't have democrat policies but
he's not really republican but he
was pro-trump we don't get it right
do you know what the strategy there is
the strategy is let p as you let people
make up their mind what i am
if i tell them what i am the other the
other side
decides not to vote for me the day you
say you're republican you've lost all
the democrats the say
the day you say you're a democrat you've
lost all the republicans but if
you say i don't know what i am i'm going
to run as this one but i'm
i'm sort of all over the map
people won't know what you are and so
they'll make it up in their mind
and that's where you want to be
we live in a in a feelings over logic
world that's right
so i'm not suggesting that i would use
logic alone
you'd have to be persuasive and uh
i have those skills
um yeah trump
years ago in a playboy interview
somebody's saying in the comments he
said that if you ran for president this
was many years ago that he would run as
a democrat he was a democrat at the time
i think
and i i've always said that trump having
been a democrat
helped him win win the election because
i think that if you can say
i used to be the other and then i became
this you at least have an appreciation
for both sides
could an independent win i don't think
so i don't think so you'd have to have a
party behind you
trump was to the left of everyone at the
primaries well it depends on the topic
probably not on immigration maybe but
you know gay marriage yes probably
oh somebody said reagan the same now is
that true remind me in my history
was reagan a democrat that turned
republican
yeah i think he was right see i think
that formula works
i think it worked for both of them as
soon as you can introduce any kind of
ambiguity
about what your political affiliation is
i think that works
yes people are saying yes okay all right
that's all for now
oh yes somebody saying in the comments
that reagan was an
energy monster you were absolutely
correct reagan was an energy monster
yeah good point that's all for now i'll
talk to you tomorrow
okay youtubers thanks for joining me
today
and i'll see you tomorrow
