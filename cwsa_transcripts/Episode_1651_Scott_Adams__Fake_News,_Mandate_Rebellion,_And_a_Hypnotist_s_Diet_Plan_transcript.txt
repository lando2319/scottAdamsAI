foreign
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of your entire
existence it's called coffee with Scott
Adams and as luck would have it that's
who I am so no substitute teachers today
you wouldn't want to substitute separate
it wouldn't be the same would it no it
wouldn't how would you like to take it
up a notch
are you satisfied with where you are in
life no no you're not
let's go and all you need is a copper
mugger glass of tanker Chelsea starting
the candy jugular flaska vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite beverage I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope have been here today
the thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now go
ah
I'm going to start with some advice
that will change some of your worlds
forever
and when I say that that's actually not
hyperbole
I'm going to say something right now
though for some of you and this is just
the law of numbers some small number of
you will completely change your life
you don't have a choice of what of being
addicted or not
you only have a choice of what you're
addicted to
so if you manage your addictions
to create an addiction let's say to
Fitness
or an addiction to even healthy food
an addiction to
um just doing good things uh for your
lifestyle taking a walk in nature
maybe you're going to be addicted to a
substance
choose your substances carefully
I'm not going to recommend any
particular substance but
if the thing you decided to use was
let's say heroin
you probably made a wrong choice
but look to get addicted to something
but choose carefully
choose carefully you probably don't have
an option of avoiding addiction
because the people who addict you are
part of the capitalist market system and
they keep getting better and you keep
staying the same
you get that right
you're you stopped evolving you're
exactly the same as at least DNA wise
you're pretty much the same as when you
were born
but the technology for getting you
addicted to stuff such as video games
such as your phone such as drugs they're
all getting way better
so it's no longer a fair fight
there probably was a time it was a fair
fight because you didn't really have
access to addicting things
and you know if you did maybe it wasn't
that addictive if you were not let's say
if you were not genetically inclined
toward alcoholism
and there wasn't much of it around
anyway well you're probably safe but
what happens if you grow up in a world
in which addiction is
the texture of your reality
it's just addictions
we're we're only addicted now
it's just to choose your addiction so
for some of you
this will be an Insight that changes the
direction of your life forever
choose your addiction
don't imagine that you won't have any
don't imagine that those days are gone
you will be addicted you can only choose
which addictions you get addicted to and
you can hope that those uh fill up your
shelf space and make you happy enough
that when somebody offers you some
heroin
you say to yourself you know I'm happy
enough without it
and then you don't have to worry about
that one
uh at the toward the end of this I'm
going to give you a hypnotist dot plan
which will not require you to be
hypnotized nor will it require you to
hypnotize yourself
is simply something that you have to
hypnotists know and other people don't
know and it basically is starting with
the mental game and working from there
and we'll do that at the end normally I
would save that content for what I call
a micro lesson for my subscribers on
locals
but if there's anything I've learned
about my subscribers on locals that when
I do something that has that
let's say that much potential benefit to
people in general they usually prefer
that I unblock it in other words that I
drop the paywall so I'm going to drop
the payroll on this one usually I ask
first but I'm sure that I know the
answer on this one this one's too good
so you wouldn't want me to keep this to
myself all right wait for that at the
end
first update on the Mandate Rebellion as
I call it the great clawback where we're
trying to get our freedoms back as
quickly as possible new news from the
CDC
um you know what CDC stands for
CDC CDC stands for children don't count
we we save them last
according to the headlines
um so here's what uh I don't think that
the kids have quite understood or I'm
sorry the uh
the officials have not quite understood
and see if this is different in your
town
uh and by the way this is in the context
of the CDC saying that the seven day
average of daily new infections is uh 42
percent down almost 43 percent down from
last week
remember we were hoping that that big
Omicron Spike would be just as sharp on
the way down
43 dis decrease one week
43 percent
so remember all of us all of us who were
saying it's time it's time you know I'd
rather go a little early than waiting
too late on this stuff because the
mandates are so oppressive
and I feel like
I feel like our timing was pretty good
pretty good so and keep in mind that
this is the winter
the winters things should be sort of at
the worst not as bad as Christmas but
still winter
and so we should be you know just
crashing the number of infections uh
hospitalizations are going down
everything's looking good and still kids
are wearing masks in school
now let me tell you just one of the many
reasons this is ridiculous you know
forget about the fact
kids don't have the same risk profile
all the the special risks that a kid has
when they're developing Etc you all know
those arguments
but here's one I haven't seen yet
and if there are any parents watching
this can you back me up on this if
you're in a kids wear masks in school
stay back me up on this
as soon as they walk out of school
they take their masks off
and then
they don't usually go home alone do they
they usually go hang out with friends
the same ones they they were hanging out
with without masks now when they're in
school
they're separated by their little desks
with their masks on the moment they walk
out they take their masks off and they
start hogging literal actual hugging
because kids are very Huggy these days
the teenagers especially and they're all
over each other they're wrestling
they're hugging they're having
sleepovers am I wrong
is it different Where You Are
kids are literally all over each other
you know in in innocent ways mostly but
I mean if you
did did kids stop making out the
teenagers stop dating
there's literally once the kids walk out
the door they're not only not separated
by desks they're literally all over each
other and I mean this is one of those
times when literally comes close to
working not exactly but but they're all
over each other
so
if you ever argue that mass made sense
surely you could not imagine it makes
sense in a world in which only a little
part of your day
you wear them and then you're surrounded
by the same people plus your family
without them
who would think that that little bit of
masking in school is that that's what's
making the difference oh it's holding
back the dam
I don't believe anybody would think that
I believe that the let me say it in a
more clear way because maybe somebody
can take this argument forward
in order to think that masking in school
makes sense you would have to be
completely blind to the fact that the
kids take them off as soon as they walk
out
you would have to just ignore that like
uh no
um
you know like fingers into your ears You
couldn't possibly with a straight face
in person no but nobody could stand in
front of you in person and say
um here I'll try to I'll try to do it it
makes perfect sense to match the kids in
school
despite knowing that on weekends and
evenings they're completely unmasked and
slobbering their spittle all over each
other in an Unstoppable way just like
always
I think that makes perfect sense
do you think somebody could say that to
your face
now here's what they could say to your
face
they could say infections are high
they could say masks work you would
argue Maybe
but they could say that
they say infections are still high masks
work schools are a place where you know
there's a lot of congregating so it
makes sense if that's always sad well
then you know maybe it's a stalemate
they argue their case you argue yours
but once you say but you do understand
that the moment they walk out the masks
come off and they're drooling all over
each other right
under those conditions which correct me
if I'm wrong was not the same as the
beginning of the pandemic
in the beginning of the pandemic there
was still more mingling after school
than during
but it was Zoom school and I think that
was actually closer to real social
distancing wasn't it
you know a lot of the kids actually did
not mingle with their friends for months
but I don't know anybody who's letting
their kid not letting their kids Mingle
maybe I mean there might be somebody
who's super afraid or has a might have a
grandparent in the house or something
I guess has exceptions but wouldn't you
say but wouldn't you say that 80 are in
full mingle mode after school
for the vast States
anyway I think that's your argument
that's your Kill Shot your kill shot is
that the kids aren't doing it after
school so whatever sense it ever made
doesn't make sense now
what did I just see go by
okay
um
there is a a new vaccine that just came
out
um I don't know if you heard about this
but they're usually a different
technology this time so the new vaccine
is made entirely from the tiers of mass
school children
um you probably didn't hear this story
but uh the big question you're asking is
how do we get enough of that you know
how are you going to get enough tiers of
mass school children and the experts
assure us that there'll be no problem
with the supply
no problem with the supply so I'm if
you're not vaccinated yet you might want
to wait because this is a more natural
way to go than the MRNA platform so the
new vaccine made entirely from the tiers
of mass school children look for that
uh here's my mask Rebel update from my
town
yesterday I had one maskless encounter
at a local coffee shop
and I was asked to put on my mask
right right
um I did because it was a small business
at a local one and I did it not because
my state requires mandates
but because I only had to keep it on for
60 seconds while I ordered and then I
took it and basically then they had to
be a coffee and then I took it off so
but to me that was a courtesy to the
employee
don't get me wrong
don't get me wrong the courtesy is just
the employee I don't have any fight with
the employee if they were asked to say
that they said that you know I generally
don't bother working people
in the same way that I was I was talking
about this the other day if you see
somebody who's a working driver
let's say the delivery truck or
something don't you usually give them
the right away
I wonder if everybody does that like if
you have any kind of ambiguous situation
if they're a working person even if
you're in a hurry
though you usually give necessarily says
hell no maybe you go the other way I
always think if you're working I give
you you know if you're on the job and
I'm not I always give you the right away
if it's ambiguous
all right
um
what happened to wasting some of their
time that doesn't uh that's a good
question and uh where I live the
mandates are going away in just a few
days
so it's not really worth a fight to get
something that's going to happen on its
own if you just wait
but uh in Safeway I was the Lone
unmasked shopper
lots and lots of people in the Safeway
that's a local grocery store and but
it's a big chain
and uh not one person said anything and
I you know paid I interacted with the
staff
you know the bagger the you know
everything no problem and yet I was
literally the only unmasked person in
the store
so I assume that the big corporations
probably have told the employees don't
push it
do you think that's um do you think I'm
making too much of an assumption
I think the small business doesn't want
to take chances because you know they
don't want to lawyer up
so I respect that but the big companies
I think have you know running through
all the simulations and said you know
it's just better if we don't get in the
business of enforcing so if they're not
enforcing shoplifting and they're not
the same company that doesn't enforce
shoplifting they're not going to chase
you they're not going to try to stop you
why would they challenge masks and sure
enough they don't I don't know if that's
every story just mine
um
anyway I was wondering if I had been
challenged if I said I had a medical
exemption for The Masks what would
happen
suppose somebody came up to your store
and said hey we're still requiring masks
and you said oh yeah I have a medical
exemption
would they ask for your papers
I don't think they would know what to do
would they
because I don't think anybody would say
no
if you said you had a medical exemption
it's just one of those things people
automatically defer to you know you're
so we're so uh trained that if somebody
has a medical exemption you're like oh
oh okay like you don't even argue that
one do you it's like if a high school
girl is missing some classes and she
says she has cramps you're like okay
like that's the end of the question
medical exemption
carry on sir
so uh I'm just curious whether that
would work as easily as I think it would
I saw Thomas Massey uh representative
Massey tweeting that he quit flying
plays in July because of the mandates
and he's been driving back and forth to
Congress every session week
for the past six months that's a lot of
driving
this man is committed so I but I
appreciate his consistency uh I have
decided to join him in the most minor
way which is I'm also not going to fly
until the mask mandates come off
anybody else want to join me I think
March 15th or something is when they're
thinking of reconsidering that if I'm
right
um but I can wait till March
so I'm definitely not going to take a
early March vacation
if I have to wear a mask on a plane if I
have to wait two weeks and then I don't
yeah so I think a little uh a little
creative economic pressure on the
airline industry they can handle it it's
just going to be a few weeks I would
just not book any flight within that
time frame unless it's work and you just
have to if it's death in the family got
to do what you got to do but I think we
could knock their their revenue down 25
percent
and get them to be more of an advocate
for ending the mandates
because they would try harder if they
Revenue were were down sharply
um
on other issues there's a story about
that the CIA may or may not be doing
something that we may or may not dislike
and I think we should all be concerned
about that the details are that there
was a secret program at the CIA
they're relied on a form of mass
surveillance activity that involved the
collection of an unknown data set
so we don't know what they were looking
at because it was highly redacted
information
uh especially some Senators looking into
a couple of democrat Senators good for
them
uh and we don't know what they gathered
or why they were doing it so it's a very
sketchy story but all of it is bad
it's just all bad whatever this is it's
all bad
all right the CDC has changed the
definition of a vaccine
which will make some people say we told
you all along that was no vaccine and
other people say
vaccines have never been 100 percent
and then you'll each claim victory which
I call word thinking everybody gets to
define words the way they want to and
then to declare victory
but the CDC change I think was
reasonable under the circumstance
so I don't I forget the details but
basically they're not saying that it's
going to prevent infections
so that they got I think they got rid of
the prevent infection part and turned it
into boosting your immune system
now some people say ha ha gotcha
vaccines always used to be about
preventing infections and so you lied to
us when you said this was a vaccine
and if you have that point of view how
many of you have that point of view
how many of you have the point of view
they're calling it a vaccine was always
a lie
seeing quite a few yeses on locals some
knows
yes kind of true
right
um if you believed that it was a lie
that it was a vaccine because they knew
it wouldn't stop transmission
um the the data shows it has an effect
but it doesn't stop it
so what did what was your opinion of the
normal seasonal flu vaccine
for those of you who knew there was a
thing called a a regular flu shot
which was called the vaccine
now you knew that was only like 25
effective right
is that right you knew that the regular
seasonal flu shot is a vaccine but it
was only meant to be there was only
advertised as being like 25 effective
because they can't really guess what the
actual flu is going to be in time to
make the vaccine
it has always been true and the most
common part literally probably one of
the most common parts of our entire
medical system is that people routinely
get seasonal flu
vaccinations that don't come anywhere
near close to stopping transmission
they simply reduce it or might help a
little bit right
so in my opinion the definition of
vaccine has for a long time been
something that could help but it's
definitely not going to stop all
transmission
but again
word thinking choose your own definition
and you'll be happy
so you may have seen the video of up in
Canada
in at least one place
um the uh there's
some kind of a police officer type
person goes to the door and they've been
looking at your social media speech and
if you said some stuff about the Mandate
they didn't like they had some
literature to hand out to you about what
a legal protest is I guess
now imagine this happening in America
this is one of those differences between
Canada and America and I don't think I'm
wrong
but I'll see what you you say right now
this is not Based on data so I could be
totally wrong it's just an impression
my impression is if somebody came to my
door in America and said we've been
watching your social media language and
here's some literature from the
government to maybe uh change your mind
about what you're saying on social media
what kind of a reception would such
officer of the law receive from me
I think it would be unkind
now if they caught me a surprise maybe I
would just be too shocked to know how to
respond
but what I learned it was a thing
like if I'd heard it happened to
somebody else by the time they got to my
door I'd be pretty prepared
and I think
that the verbal tirade that I would
unleash on such a person
would be sufficient to give them PTSD
and maybe cause them to retire
immediately
but if I'm not good enough to do it I
think my neighbors could get it done
do you think do you think this would fly
in America
I think we would be so viciously uh
verbally uh abusive to anybody who tried
this you knock on my freaking door I
don't even want to tell a marketer
calling
but if you knock on my door and you
disturb me at home do you know that the
first thing would be I don't even care
what your stupid flyer says
you knocked on my door
for legal activity that I did at home on
social media
I don't even care what why you're there
you're already in trouble with me so and
by the time you hand me that uh brochure
I'm pissed
I'm pissed and
if you don't think that Americans will
say bad things to people in the law
enforcement Community well you haven't
spent much time in America because we
will say Very Bad Things To law
enforcement at Great personal risk we
will say anything to a law enforcement
person if we're mad enough it's part of
the American culture
now
am I wrong that this wouldn't fly in
America
or or am I just thinking we're awesome
and you know it's just one of those
things
I don't know it just feels like it
so uh
keep an eye on that
um there's some new scary news on Long
covet
so this would be people who get uh covid
and according to article in nature
which uh I guess at this point I should
put a disclaimer on anything about a
study or data and the disclaimer is
everything we've seen so far seems
sketchy
for like two years it just seems like
everything we see is like I don't know
Maybe
but something sketchy about this so I
guess you know a great assault on
everything but the what caught my
attention
is the degree
I mean how big a an effect this is so
the study showed that uh
30 days after infection for people who
got coveted now these are mostly
unvaccinated people I believe
if they got covered they had all manner
of uh heart diseases like a whole bunch
of them and the percentage of difference
is gigantic
it's like you know 40 60 differences
like gigantic differences compared to
the Baseline of somebody who never had
coveted
now I don't know if any of that can be
explained by any other variable that
they didn't control for that's what you
always have to you know I don't know if
the study was done with all the right
parameters and scientific care
but if this is true so here this is how
many people die normally so forget about
covid
659 000 people in America died from
heart disease last year
that's the magnitude
what if that goes up by half
because of covet
we're talking about hundreds of
thousands of people with extra heart
disease and we're talking about a huge
risk from the virus itself if it's true
now of course you always have to worry
if this is part of the scare campaign
yeah I'm seeing the comments come on
Scott so you have to wonder if when you
see data like this is it part of a scare
campaign to get you vaccinated right is
that is that what you're thinking
so I don't think you necessarily have to
believe the data now some of you are
saying but what about the data that says
that the vaccination itself
will increase your risk well
um I think that applies only to a
small percentage of people and generally
speaking I think science let's just say
that the the consensus of science which
you might disagree with
but the consensus is very strongly on
your heart risk from getting coveted is
way higher way higher
than you risk from the vaccine
based on the data so far but is the data
correct
I don't know is any data correct
I don't know it's pretty scary
um remember I told you long ago that if
you want to predict the future look what
insurance companies are doing
because insurance companies will price
some behaviors out of existence
and and you you'll be looking in the
wrong direction you'll say what's the
government say about this Behavior but
it doesn't matter if the insurance
company is pricing it out of existence
it kind of doesn't matter what the law
is so just look at the insurance
companies to know what's going to happen
in the future and here's what insurance
companies are doing
um
apparently they're going to charge more
for your life insurance
if you live in a county with a low
vaccination rate
so insurance companies are already
pricing vaccination into their model
now
are the insurance companies good at
looking at studies and estimating the
odds of things
well I don't know I've never worked at
an insurance company but I would guess
they're really good at it
what
I mean compared to other Industries
who's going to be better at estimating
risk than an insurance company a big one
anyway now that doesn't mean they get it
right all the time but in terms of a
profession
they're the ones who have to get it
right that's their whole business model
and there's business model at the moment
says that they would charge you more if
you're unvaccinated
again
that doesn't mean this is the final word
because all data is suspect in 2022.
but in case you were wondering what the
most qualified people are saying in my
opinion the most qualified people would
be the insurance companies
because they have the greatest Financial
incentive
they would hire the most qualified
people because they can't get it wrong
right this is one of those things they
just can't get wrong they have to get
this right the rest of us might be
involved in propaganda and confirmation
bias and you know God knows what maybe
people are bought off but the insurance
companies just have to get it right
and they say getting vaccinated is way
safer than not being vaccinated
that's not me saying it I'm just passing
along now here's the only case I would
like to make
that not everybody is equally credible
am I right not everybody is equally
credible who is Credible is the is the
news industry credible
not so much
big Pharma
we wish not so much government not so
much is your insurance company on your
side of course not of course not they're
a big company they're on their own side
but in this very narrow question
can you trust the free market
to make insurance companies do at least
the hardest amount of legitimate work
with the best people to figure out what
is true and what is not true
I think you could
doesn't mean they're right that's a
different question but who would be the
most believable most credible in the
long run
in the long run
so Bob you're on a slightly different
point than I am I'm not saying you
should trust any big company
make sure you hear that part clearly or
else you'll be confused you shouldn't
trust any big company including
insurance companies I'm just saying that
in that narrow question
they have to get the odds right
right now I suppose they could get the
odds wrong and just overcharge but
somebody's going to notice and some
other company will eventually you know
say hey I'll charge less because I can
and I'll undercut my competition so in
theory Market competition should get you
the right answer
Market competition plus time
plus insurance companies business model
should get you the best answer anybody
disagree
who would you trust let's say over a few
years not on day one in the Fargo War
everybody's wrong but over a few years
who would be more likely to get it right
than the insurance companies
plus lawsuits
actually that's a good comment I if if
I'm interpreting that right you're
saying that a loss would probably do it
be a good job of bringing in you know
judged
adjudicate literally literally
adjudicated information yeah that's a
good point
anyway just keep an eye on that doesn't
mean they're right
it just means you should know about it
so did you see the viral video of uh I
guess he's an MMA fighter of some
renowned named Israel uh adesanya so I'd
never heard of him but maybe if you
follow MMA you would know he looks he
looks pretty awesome
and there was some MMA event he was at
and I was a reporter asked about Joe
Rogan and uh Israel who began his
comments he jumped in and said I'm black
so I'll take this
and then
he just went on the most awesome uh the
most awesome defense of Joe Rogan you've
ever seen I'm not even going to try to
paraphrase it because he did it so well
you just should see the original and not
not hear it ruined by me
but but I'd like to point out that in
his very first sentence he used the c
word
the c word that got me demonetized on on
YouTube
uh the one that I used against my my
critic online there yes he just throws
out the c word in the first part of the
half of his sentence and then he goes on
and that wasn't even that wasn't even
the good part that was just the
appetizer
he uses the c word as just the appetizer
and then he gets to the main course
anyway go see yourself it's worth it you
can see it in my Twitter feed
um California schools were in crisis
and Oakland is going to close seven
schools
so that's in my neighborhood they're
going to close seven schools but a
variety of factors so the charter
schools are sucking up some students
uh people are leaving the state
the story the news story said flattened
immigration
but that must be a delayed effect from a
carryover from the Trump Administration
right because it's not flattened at the
moment I don't think but uh it was
flattened for a while so I guess that
affected the School attendance and lower
birth rates
so the public schools are really hurting
financially and otherwise and the
private schools the charter schools Etc
are all going up
so in terms of Direction it's clear that
things are going to get worse for
anybody who stays in these public
schools and they're going to get a lot
better in terms of the options anyway
for people leaving
so keep an eye on that
um
there is more fake news how many of you
saw some fake news it's being called
fake news anyway uh and because I have
the most skeptical audience on the
planet I will tell you that we don't
believe the fact Checkers automatically
are you happy
so if I tell you something's been fact
checked that doesn't mean I believe the
fact Jack but I think you should hear it
just I think you should hear it okay
and the
um apparently there were a number of
claims this week online
that there were excess deaths if you
look at the excess mortality rates and
that there were vaccine related because
the other causes were ruled out
apparently that's fake news and that the
Scott Davidson the CEO of an insurance
company so here again Moore Insurance
Company wisdom one America
he said that they saw a 40 rise in death
rates among working age individuals that
it ensures
so this is its own data and again I
don't think they have the wrong data
they're just looking at their own
customer base
they have good data on their own
customer base for sure
so if they saw a 40 rise in death rates
um in the working age groups in the
third quarter
and he told them that the uh that is
consistent with data from the CDC but
it's related to covet deaths um both
direct and indirect
so
there are both direct covidescent
indirect the indirect ones would be
the lockdown
and how that affected people getting
normal checkups and cancer checks and
stuff like that so oh my God that's a
that's a pretty big death rate and
certainly that argues against the uh
against the lockdowns somewhat
all right
um
I saw a tweet by Ian miles Jiang who is
a good follow you should follow him he's
got lots of good stuff but I had to take
some exception with this so there's a
Biden Administration has a new person
overseeing the nuclear the nuclear
energy program in this country I guess
and this is what Ian miles Chung says
um because there's a video of this
individual uh wearing a dress with a
mustache and talking about
um identity Etc and so this is uh Ian
miles tweet he said this person
identifies as genderqueer with they them
pronouns but then he goes on to
misgender him by saying his kinks are
animal sexuality and gay Uncle BDSM is
now in charge of overseeing America's
nuclear power plants this is how
Empire's end not with a bang but with
every work but whatever the hell this is
um
here's my counter to that
there there's a thing I do on topics
like this as well as music and fashion
and a number of other topics I
continually ask myself this question
what's this going to look like later
you know later on
later on am I going to have a different
view of this in other words you know if
you went through the Jim Crow days
could you see then that later on this is
going to look really bad right like was
it obvious at the time could anybody say
well you know 20 years from now we're
going to really feel dumb that we did
this
and I wonder if the way we are treating
members of the
lbqtq
LBGTQ Community I'm wondering if the way
that we treat them we're just going to
look back in 20 years and say what the
hell were we doing
you know why why do we even care about
that that was just their own business so
that's the first check
and again that's just a check that's not
an opinion I'm just saying you should
just say what it was this going to look
like in 20 years whatever you come up
with is your your own opinion
and
um
I would put the context on it like this
you're looking at an individual
who has decided to be super transparent
you're comparing them
I just misgendered let me say this just
so I can be really clear
as you know and much to the annoyance of
my audience I'm a big supporter of the
lgbtq community big fan
but I require one thing in return
one thing that if I misgender somebody
you don't give me a hard time about it
because there's no bad intention right
that's all I ask in return and I'm
insistent on that there I won't take any
I won't take any pushback on that
my that's my line I I will give you
respect if you understand that there's a
a practical limit on people remembering
to use the right words and blah blah
blah just just all I ask is don't be an
like I'll do my best
but you do your best too
that's all I ask
that's all I ask all right
so here's my take if every leader were
as transparent as the person in question
here we would be horrified
all of our leaders would look like
horrible people if we knew all of their
inner thoughts
if they never hid anything about
themselves ever
you would hate everybody
right there's a reason people are
private it's because people would judge
them
so I'm not I'm not sure that I'm going
to give
this individual
a I'm not going to ding this person for
being transparent
when all I'm asking for is for people to
be transparent
if I mean for my benefit
right transparency is for my benefit
would you rather that this person hid
this preference and then Russia found
out about it
ah ah I just flipped a couple of you
didn't I
didn't I
what's safer
from uh blackmail
because you know so you assume that our
opponents would like to Blackmail
anybody that they could
to tell them to do whatever is bad for
America hey you stopped making nuclear
plants or whatever
in this case so do you want somebody who
has a secret life that they could be
blackmailed for or somebody who's
completely unblackmailable
that was sort of like Trump
what what exactly were you going to find
out about him that you didn't assume was
true anyway he was you know in a way
almost on blackmailable
so
um I think everybody's a freak when you
take the top layer off
um and I think that I'd rather have
transparency as long as a person can do
a good job
so
am I as uh let's say uncomfortable with
it as you are
probably
probably I'll be honest when you see
anything that's
um let's say just outside of your
experience
of what you're used to
it makes you uncomfortable doesn't it
I can remember a time and let me let me
confess this
because I think everybody should be able
to confess this there was a time I would
have been uncomfortable around a gay man
I'm not now
you know at the moment I'm not even sure
it ever like trips my conscious you know
my conscious wire
now it's just completely invisible you
live in California long enough and
whatever is routine in California it
becomes your routine as well
but
have has any have any of you had that
Journey
have you ever had the journey where
you're like ah this is outside my normal
Zone I feel uncomfortable and then later
you're like okay it's the same as
everything else right so do you believe
there will never be a time
that saying Harry Styles wear a dress
will be anything
uh you know in the case of entertainers
they're trying to trying to be
provocative but I think there will be a
time when
um
people will be so transparent with this
stuff specifically that you'll just stop
caring about it just won't even it won't
even won't be in your mind at all it'll
just disappear
so
that's that's where uh Ian miles
Jung and I may disagree on what this
would look like 20 years from now
if you're judging it today well you know
I can see maybe how he got to that
opinion but I but I disagree with it how
would you like to see
a hypnotist diet plan
um I have just enough time to do this
okay
this is a plan
for for managing your diet not losing
weight just managing your diet that a
hypnotist would use
now I'm not recommending this plan for
you I'm not a doctor check with your
doctor but it's an example of how a
hypnotist would approach it and it's an
example of a system versus a goal if
you're just trying to lose weight the
normal way
you might just try to use your willpower
hypnotist would never tell you to use
your willpower because I don't think it
exists
here's how I would do it I would break
it into three parts
I would first say let me solve my
cravings
because the Cravings are the hard part
and I would say to myself don't work
don't worry about quantity never let
yourself be hungry Phase One never be
hungry eat as much as you want but only
good food
broccoli all you want broccoli broccoli
broccoli lean meat as much as you want
forget about calories this in this phase
you're just trying to not eat chocolate
not eat sweets and stuff that will make
you fat that's all you're doing there is
no other objective of the first phase
then to get rid of your Cravings also
work on your sleep
how many of you knew that when you're
sleepy it feels like you're hungry and
you can't eat enough you're like why why
does this food not make me not hungry
anymore I'm just eating it's because
you're sleepy so to get rid of your
Cravings eat good food as much as you
want and do not worry do not worry
about
quantity yet
phase two
once you got rid of your Cravings moved
to foods and this is again this is not
doctor recommendation you should all
talk to your doctors before you go on a
diet this is just how I do it as an
example of how you might create your own
system so use this as a just as one of
the things in your mental models that
you can go to ah I try to shrink my
stomach I'm not entirely sure there's
any science to this
let me be clear but it seems to me that
if I go a few days without eating
something of bulk I feel as if
physically my stomach is shrunk I don't
know if that's literally true but it has
the feeling
and so I eat things that are high in
protein but small and bulk
for a while once I feel that eating much
becomes uncomfortable
then I go to the last one which is
reducing calories making sure make sure
you have some kind of a fitness plan and
then make it easy
to keep off the bad stuff you have to
make it easy for yourself so don't keep
any bad food in the house if you have
bad food in the house you will eat the
bad food
so don't
just don't keep it in the house and then
learn by a b testing over time how to
make this healthier food more tasty on
day one of becoming a healthy eater it's
hell because you don't know how to make
anything taste good but once you learn
that a little lemon a little soy sauce
a little salt and pepper can make just
about anything taste interesting you're
you're all set but you have to do that
by a b testing because your taste buds
are different than everyone else's so
this system depends on using the mental
part as your primary focus as opposed to
willpower which is actually an illusion
nobody has willpower now here are a
couple other things the hypnotist would
do some people say don't look at the
scales
nope look at the scales because that
which is not measured is not managed you
should look at your scale every day yes
I get that muscle weighs blah blah blah
I don't care
manage it by measuring it if you don't
measure it your brain will not be
committed you need to see it period
anybody who gives you advice do not look
at the scale is not thinking like a
hypnotist and I don't think that that's
good advice number two some of you say
I'll do that diet but I'll do a cheat
day on the weekends
I get why you do it because you make it
makes you feel like you know it's easier
to sacrifice I
strongly disagree with that the
hypnotist would say once you've
developed a habit let's say the habit of
getting rid of your Cravings you don't
want them back
do not let them back in I'll tell you
Halloween is a tough time at my house
because it takes me two months to get
off Snickers candy bars and there'll be
this big barrel of them left over
you think I can resist them I probably
have more willpower you know the the
fake kind because it doesn't really
exist but the ability to not do things
that are harmful
I'm really high up on that self-control
list
like you you probably even conserve it
right I'm always here for work
don't weigh too much right yeah it's
obvious that I have some kind of
self-control as we call it
but even I can't keep my hands out of
these Snickers candy bars if there's a
barrel of them sitting there I just have
to get them out of the house that's the
only thing I can do so manage things
like a hypnotist don't have cheat days
because it sets you back
always look at your uh weight every day
every single day you should weigh
yourself and then work on your Cravings
first to shrink your stomach second by
low low bulk foods and then go back to
your bulky Foods if they're healthy but
reduce your calories it'll be easy but
then if you build a system that makes it
easy that ladies and gentlemen is your
micro lesson on diet now
within this system you have lots of
flexibility about what's in and what's
happening right and that's where your
individual system comes into play some
of you might say you know I don't really
need this middle part
and that might be true
so a b testing if you do it without the
middle part and it works keep doing that
the middle part if you're just listening
is the shrinking the stomach part so do
what works for you but use this as maybe
a starting guide for something that
would get you going all right how hard
is it to eat as much as you want
pretty easy just eat as much as you want
and you'll be full and that candy bar
won't look as good as it did before you
were full that ladies and gentlemen is
all I have for you today probably the
most useful
live stream of all time
that might actually be true by the way
that might actually literally be true
because a lot of you are going to take
the star and use it I know that from
history because I've been promoting this
from my book I had a field almost
everything is still win big
with a few tweaks so I know that people
are using it successfully
so some percentage of you
just had your complete life changed
around
and that's why you come here might not
be you this time
but one of these days
I'm Gonna Get You
and that's all we have
I'll see you tomorrow YouTube
