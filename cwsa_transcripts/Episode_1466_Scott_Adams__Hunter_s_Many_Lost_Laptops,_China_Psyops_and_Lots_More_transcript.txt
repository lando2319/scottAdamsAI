hey everybody it's time
time for the best part of the day the
the highlight
of your entire 24 hours it's called the
simultaneous sip and coffee with scott
adams and aren't you glad you're here
yeah you are
and all you need to make this extra
special is a copper mug or glass a
tanker chelsea steiner canteen joker
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite look what i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's coming at you right now go
well the first thing we're going to do
is kill the feed from locals because we
again have a
crackle
so
bear with me one moment well the locals
people get rebooted here we'll see if we
can make that work
turn off all my devices
and when these devices get turned back
on there's a reasonably good chance it
might work let's see
something about booting and rebooting
this seems to make a difference sorry
about that
all right
nope that's not it
um
all right looks like uh
looks like we're maybe not going to be
working on
the platform let's see hold on just
second
hold on
that's the first time that's happened
all right one moment and this will be
working like crazy
i promise you you know the problem with
the live streams i said this before
is that
you can't really get a platform that'll
work twice in a row
and it looks like the locals platform is
not working today
so unfortunately i won't be able to
to stream on there so i'll stream only
on
youtube today
fake news today
arnold schwarzenegger
is quoted as saying talking about
wearing
masks or vaccinations i think
and arnold said screw your freedoms
get the vaccination
so how was that reported
it was reported
as though arnold schwarzenegger doesn't
like freedom
i don't think so
i don't think that's the case
i believe that arnold schwarzenegger
actually likes freedom
and
the context of course is that there's no
such thing as absolute freedom
the the
the context is you can't yell
fire in a grounded theater you know that
would be one kind of freedom you're not
allowed to
drink as much as you want and drive your
car you're not allowed to
i don't
you're not allowed to do lots of things
and fly a plane
so
do we have freedom in this country
and the answer is no
no we don't have freedom when our
freedom would impinge on other people's
health and safety and happiness we've
never had that
so arnold is simply making a statement
which 100 of the world agrees with
um i mean he just does it in his
colorful arnold way when he says screw
your freedoms and that gets a lot of
press
but he's not disagreeing with anything
that anybody says
to to imagine that he's saying something
you don't agree with
no
fake news number two
uh there was a story about a
sheriff who just came in contact with
some fentanyl as part of his work
and
had an overdose and almost died
just from coming in contact
with fentanyl and then today the ap does
a fact jack and says experts say you're
highly unlikely to od on fentanyl just
by being near the drug
after a misleading video claimed that
happened to a san diego sheriff
and now the sheriff acknowledges that he
not a doctor concluded that it was an
overdose
now
if this fact check is true
has everything that i've been hearing up
to this point been not true
have you not heard the stories of the
of the drug sniffing dogs that have to
be uh taken they were taken out after a
certain amount of time because they
could sniff fentanyl and just die
haven't we seen this
don't we know for example that people
who press the pills you know they put
the fentanyl into the
the actual finished product don't we
hear about them dying from breathing and
stuff
is all of that made up
right yeah i know there's body camera
footage and stuff but we're not talking
about whether or not he came in contact
with fentanyl i guess that's for sure
the question is whether the fentanyl is
what caused his physical reaction
and i'm thinking
i don't know if i believe this fact
check
do you
seriously i've been following this since
you know my stepson overdosed
and 2018. and are you telling me that
every story i've heard about this
that you could die from just physical
contact with it and breathing in the
fumes all of it's all of it's not true
that's what the ap fact check is saying
at the moment i don't even have an
opinion
of which one of these is true
but they do say highly unlikely which
suggests it's at least happened
so there's your
there's that's your fake news of the day
but i don't know which is the fake
is it fake that you can get these
overdoses reasonably easily or is it
fake
that you can't i don't know
all right here's one of the most
interesting stories that flew under the
radar and i'm going to tie this to
to another persuasion story that's
coming up
so it turns out that if you wanted to
fight climate change
the way the left would like to do it the
preferred way of the left what would you
have to do
well you'd need lots of windmills and
you didn't need lots of solar panels
where do you get that stuff
china
so it turns out
that the one and only way you can
acquire enough green energy producing
stuff
to take a whack at climate change uh the
the left leaning way to do it
you would have to buy massive amounts of
stuff from china
now what is another thing that even
democrats want
even chuck schumer chuck schumer is one
of the leaders of this
they want to buy american
see the problem
the way the way democrats want to solve
climate change is by violating their
other things
buying american you can't do both so you
can either buy massive solar panels
or you can buy american which would give
you no massive panels because we don't
have enough of that stuff
so senator dan sullivan a republican
from alaska
cleverly came up with this amendment
to say that renewable energy projects
have to buy their
they can't buy their stuff from china
kind of clever isn't it
so he's going to make the democrats vote
in favor of buying stuff from china
kind of forces them in the corner now i
don't know if that's just a political
thing or if he just
thinks it's a good idea to not buy from
china which which is a good idea
but uh
you're gonna have to pick now remember
this story
remember the story about buying with the
only place we can get our green energy
stuff
mostly solar panels i think is the
biggest category
is from china just remember that story
and i'm going to tie it together with
another one later
but first
there's a new video that's come out
showing hunter biden on video with some
young woman in a hotel room
complaining that russian drug dealers
stole another one of his laptops
he was in a vegas room in 2018.
the claim is that at least three of
hunter le hunter biden's laptops have
been stolen
and that russians are implicated in it
now if that's not crazy enough listen to
what
things he said he said they have videos
of me doing this he said referring to
the filmed sex he just finished
they have videos of me doing crazy
effing
sex effin you know
and uh
so uh hunter's claim you know also
suggests that uh there's a foreign
intelligence operation running against
him
so how many of you have ever lost uh
let's see in the comments
how many of you have ever lost
uh a laptop
maybe some of you probably laughed lost
the laptop how many of you have ever
lost
two laptops
okay how many of you have ever lost
three laptops
how high do you have to be
to lose three laptops
for me after the first two i'd start
getting cautious
but here's the most surprising part
it's not three
remember when you thought it was one
laptop and then you find out it's three
it's not three either
i found another one of hunter biden's
laptops in my backyard
and i'm going to
tell you its contents
on camera right now
this is sort of a geraldo opening the
vault situation i don't know what i'm
going to
encounter but this is the fourth hunter
biden laptop
and obviously it's password protected so
um this bear with me this may take a
minute to guess the password
probably has uh characters and numbers
and maybe one at least one special
character
so we'll i'm just gonna pour through
this and see if i can get this by brute
force
i'm just gonna guess uh what would be a
good hunter biden password i'm going to
go with uh
how about
hookers and cote cocaine
hookers
and cocaine
69
exclamation point
first try
well
i thought we're going to be here a while
but i got it on the first try
and uh i don't want to
i don't want to show you what's on the
laptop until i've reviewed it so if you
don't mind i'll just talk talk my way
through it and let you know what i'm
finding here
it looks like there are a number of
videos
let me review one of these videos
okay so it looks like a hunter and some
nice young woman are um enjoying a
vacation of some sort um
in a hotel room can't tell where um
and looks like it looks like there's no
ac in the hotel hunter looks hot he's
taking off his shirt
uh that's how hot it is there's no ac in
the hotel and uh well his the young lady
is taking off her top
as well
there seems to be some kind of baking
looks like they're going to bake
i know it's a some kind of flour
some kind of white powder
and though
some of it seems spilled on top of the
the young lady she should be wiping that
off probably with a
same kind of a towel or okay she's not
going to use a towel
it looks like hunter is going to take
care of that for her so he'll probably
go get a towel
okay he's not using the towel
well um
and now uh
god hunter is very flexible
he's a he's a flexible guy
yoga do you think maybe yoga
and
uh whoa
oh
hunter
yowzer
well
um
my eyes ah
okay let's put this away
okay
so um the question i ask you is uh if
let me ask the question everybody's
gonna ask
and it goes like this
if don jr
lost
three laptops
possibly for
to maybe russian operatives
do you think that would have been a
problem
maybe it would be a
front-page news
kind of thing
but that's what we know is that uh
russia apparently was stealing lots of
hunter biden laptops and you can't you
imagine the actual russian foreign
intelligence people
they'll they're like they'll be like uh
yeah we got it we got 100 buttons laptop
and then what does their boss say
one
you only got one of his laptops
and the operative bit will be like yeah
but i mean seriously this is good
we got
joe biden's son's laptop it's in our
hands this is good work
and the boss says
but just one
you only got 100 biden laptop
i can't even give you a raise this year
with that kind of performance so the
intelligence guy goes out they run
another operation they get a second
laptop he takes it back to his boss two
laptops nobody in the history
this is my bad russian accent in the
history of intelligence operations
nobody has ever
got two laptops
two
and the boss says two
two's not bad
i would say that's
meets expectations
meets expectations but
we do expect more in our intelligence
people we we expect them to excel
to more than meet expectations
so try to get that third laptop if you
would
worst boss in the world but apparently
he gets results
the alternative being executed i imagine
um have you noticed that there's uh
a lot of
complicated issues lately some of the
issues are easy like hunter biden's
laptop
hunter biden got really messed up
and lost the laptop three times
that's pretty easy to understand but
here are some clients some issues that
the public
is meant to participate in
climate change
is climate change uh complicated
is this something that you can do your
own research
get yourself a good answer it's kind of
hard
kind of hard how about the pandemic
is everybody doing their own research
and getting the right answer there
well they're not getting the same answer
i don't know if it's the right answer
but it's not the same
how about critical race theory
has everybody done their research have
you gone to the uh source materials from
decades ago and learned the history of
it
no no you either like it or you don't
how about artificial intelligence going
to take over the world and become our
masters any day now
a lot of you
experts in ai
no
no we're not
it feels to me
that all the big issues take economics
take the uh the national debt
is it definitely true that we've crushed
ourselves with national debt and we're
all doomed
i don't know
apparently national debt's kind of
complicated it's not like personal debt
there are a lot of moving parts and it
depends what other people are doing and
what other people expect in the future
etc so we've got all these big issues
and we don't understand any of them
we really don't but yet we're expected
to be active parts of the process
because it's a
democratic-like
process that we're in
how are we going to help when we're all
just under this weird illusion that we
can do our own research and come to you
know good opinions of this stuff we
can't do that
can't even get close
well we have a new category i'm going to
call
perma news
news that
is the same every day but different
oh yeah it's different but it's still
the same let me give you an example
the infrastructure bill
is still moving forward
uh slowly with stops and starts
do you think i might be able to tell you
that same headline tomorrow
and the day after
the day after
and the day after yeah i think i will
it's the permanent
news all right here was a surprising
event
uh fox news reporting that one
california school district
uh pasa robles i think
blocked critical race theory in his
classrooms
that's in california
did you expect a california school board
to block critical race theory teaching
in school
i did not see that coming and i'm
wondering if this is any kind of
indication of a coming trend or not
because i really would have expected
zero schools in california to do that
so one you know even though it's just
one
still seems significant just because
it's california
all right
as as you know i've been sometimes
criticized
for being critical of studies that don't
agree with me
but less critical of studies
that agree with me
that's probably true part of that reason
is that i wouldn't send you a study that
agrees with me
if i thought it was a bad one
so there's there's a little bit of
filtering going on there
i do see studies that agree with me
that are low quality studies but i don't
bother tweeting them
because it just works against my own
argument
so yes there's definitely some selection
bias going on there but here's one that
i tweeted
a tweet that refers to a bunch of
studies that all go against my opinion
so if you're saying to yourself scott
why don't you ever tweet
something that goes against your opinion
if science
goes that way well i just did
but like
exactly like the science that goes my
way
i don't trust it
so i wouldn't trust this what i'm going
to tell you next or or anything else
basically on this topic
but as jc oviedo
tweets that
an article showing there are 14
randomized controlled trials about masks
saying that they're not effective
do you believe that
do you believe that at this day this far
into the pandemic that somebody can
organize a tweet
or about an article and that the article
could run through all these 14
randomized controlled trials the the
so-called gold standard best kinds of
tests
that show that mass don't work
now
do you believe that
what is your what level of credibility
do you put on
somebody
who you don't know
looked at a bunch of
trials that you didn't look at
and came to a conclusion that's opposite
opposite
every top medical expert
collectively i'm not saying there are no
rogues but collectively the top experts
in every single industrialized country
the top medical experts in every
industrialized country disagree with us
but it's very convincing
14 randomized controlled trials
oh wait
how could you do a randomized controlled
study of the coronavirus during the
pandemic
you can't
so these are 14 randomized controlled
tests
of something else
that's right now
is a test of something else that's close
enough
that it still tells you something about
the coronavirus it might
it might be close enough
so i i tweeted around because i can't
personally tell tell you that there's
anything wrong with these studies except
that they're not on the right topic
but they might tell you something you
know if
if the mass didn't work for anything
ever
that would tell you something right even
though it's not exactly the right topic
so i would say that the level of
credibility i would put on these 14
randomized controlled trials is low
and here's my biggest question
did they did they test a viral load
in other words
could you find out that 100 of the
people
in a room will get infected whether you
have a mask or not
let's say that's true let's say you find
out that you put a bunch of people in
the room with an infected person
and you could do the experiment a
thousand times
and every time you did the experiment
the other person in the room wearing a
mask got infected
let's just say you could do that what
would that tell you
would that tell you that masks don't
work go if you if you could reproduce it
infinite times and every single time the
person wearing a mask in the same room
with the infected person every single
time the other person got infected
what would that tell you about the
effectiveness of masks would that tell
you they don't work because that would
be 100 failure right
a hundred percent failure wouldn't that
tell you they don't work
nope
it wouldn't
why not
somebody says other variables but i've
i've intentionally uh taken out the
other variables so it's an artificial
situation in which
not really any other variables
um
yeah quit with the either or yeah that's
always a problem okay yes so there we go
somebody's on to it jc yeah define
worked
suppose the people who wore the mask got
a lower viral load
do masks work
did any of the randomized controlled
trials
test to see if the people who did get
affected infected with mass
got less infected because their overall
load was less
probably didn't test it right
so if you're asking me do masks work you
have to include not just did people get
infected or not
you have to test did they get
as high a viral load
on initial infection because we know
that has a huge impact on outcomes
now
it is not my claim
from the beginning
that the way masks work is reduce the
viral load but everybody still gets
infected that's not my claim i'm just
saying that this is complicated stuff
and if you believe that you can look at
this tweet and these studies or anything
else and quote
do your own research
how many of you who think you can do
your own research
would have known to ask the question
about whether the viral load was the
same
masked or unmasked
because if you didn't know they asked to
ask that question
most of you probably did but if you
didn't know to ask that question
what good would it do to do your own
research you would be researching
basically the wrong questions or
incomplete
all right
there's another study should we trust
this study no all studies are are
subject to you know
low credibility until they're reproduced
and
peer-reviewed and randomized controlled
tests and all that stuff i think we've
learned all that by now but i'll just
tell you about it there's a study that
suggests
that how well you do with the coven 19
may have to do with your exposure to
prior coronaviruses different kind of
coronary viruses
and seems to be a pretty strong
correlation that if you've been exposed
before
you did much better
do you believe that
do you believe the exposure to other
coronaviruses
gives you some protection
and that also makes me ask this question
if the lockdowns and
all the mitigation strategies
kept us from getting regular colds
as effectively as it kept us from
getting coronavirus i've now heard of
exactly one person who had a
non-coronavirus illness in the past year
just once i only know one person who had
a sore throat and it wasn't coronavirus
that's it in a year
now what happens if you take all of
those
protective colds and you know minor flus
or whatever that normally happen every
year what if you take them out of the
mix
wouldn't they be giving people
protection
because
we would have been accidentally uh semi
um
vaccinating people in a sense in a
figurative sense we would have been
my vaccinating the entire public
simply by letting them get common colds
for that year but if you don't let them
get common colds for a year
we're all virgin
virgins basically so the the last
immunity you got was from the last cold
and that might have been a while
so there's also a suggestion that if
you're around kids you're more likely to
uh have a good outcome with the
coronavirus because you probably got a
lot of common colds because kids bring
back a lot of
a lot of illness
there's also a suggestion that maybe the
reason the kids don't have bad outcomes
is because they've had so many regular
colds
kids get way more regular
respiratory problems
so i don't know if this study will hold
up but if it does that could be a big
big part of the mystery of why some
people have good outcomes and some don't
and even why the
and especially why any kind of pandemic
would ever die out
it might be that the only thing that
kills one of these uh
viruses
is the common cold
right because if the common cold can
give you some kind of immunity even if
it's temporary and if it's incomplete it
might be the only thing that gets the r
under one
so that your spread is low enough that
it dies out
what if the only thing that works is
letting us get other colds
i could you rule that out that's the
only thing that stops any pandemic is
getting related colds and it gives you
some stuff i don't know
one of the things i noticed with really
good disasters is that they breed new
words we've never heard before
and apparently there's one fire in
california the dixie fire
that's just been going on for a long
time now
that is producing
a pyro cumulonimbus cloud
a word i've never heard before
pyrocumulonimbus so it must be a cloud
of smoke i guess 40 000 feet above the
eastern edge of the dixie fire
and it's such an intense fire
that is generating something called a
fire whirl
that shot up like an eerie tendril
so basically was like reverse lightning
like a fire bolt going into the sky or
something
and i'm thinking when you're when your
natural disasters get so intense you
have to invent new words for them
that's a pretty bad fire that's bad fire
all right tying back uh some other
topics here china psyops so i saw a
jackpot tweet talking about uh
human events talking about a daily mail
story
this says that there were some chinese
publications
that made up a person
named wilson edwards
now i assume that they just watched
american movies and thought wilson was a
popular first name
and
so they come up with this
generic sounding white guy
wilson edwards that's the whitest
sounding generic white guy so they made
this guy up he didn't exist and they
said that he was a swiss biologist
that said that
claiming that the united states was
pressuring the world health organization
into investigating the wuhan lab leak
theory
so
i guess there are three publications in
china the people's daily china daily and
cgtn tv
who all quoted this person who doesn't
exist so china
literally made up a person
and then put that person in the news
until that news became international
news
now
that would be an example of a chinese
psychological operation
what other ones have they done
for example um i was on dr drew's show
recently and we were talking about the
fact that
remember the initial january january
2020
videos of people collapsing in the
street in wuhan
why don't we know
what that was about now it's been a long
time
obviously the coronavirus does not make
people collapse in the streets
why did we see video of it
was that a chinese
operation
because the china never said hey that's
a fake video did they
i think china wants you to believe that
those were real video of people falling
dead in the streets but they wouldn't
make china look good
but it would certainly scare the crap
out of all the other countries so was it
a psychological operation and if it was
what exactly was the point of it to get
the rest of the world to shut down
because that's what happened i mean if
that was the point of it was kind of
brilliant the way it worked
but i don't know that that was a point
of it so here's a question i ask what
other chinese psychological operations
are being run right now
that you think are real
let me suggest some candidates
now this is not an assertion of truth
i'm just saying if you were looking to
find out where there were some chinese
operations
where would you look for them like what
would it look like
i'll give you some candidates and again
i'm not claiming these are psyops i'm
just saying that they look like it in
the sense that that's what you'd expect
to see
you saw the news that
the judge is allowing dominion to sue
i guess giuliani and
mike lindell and um
uh
what's the other lawyer there
so
so the lawsuits are going forward
because they were the ones who made the
most outrageous claims about the
election being stolen with stories about
you know venezuelan
machines and all kinds of stuff
what are the odds that that
didn't come from china
or russia but let's just use china as
our example
do you think that all of those wild
conspiracy theories
got to those lawyers
just from organic
places
and they just made a mistake when they
did their own research or do you think
that that was a psyop
because that would be exactly what china
would want to do
china would want us to think our
elections were
were not credible
so that doesn't mean they did it
but since we know that china is actively
doing
psychological operations i mean it's
kind of obvious
why wouldn't they have done that
so if they didn't do it
why not because it would be the obvious
thing to do we know that they can make
up an entire person this biologist guy
they just made it up you don't you don't
think that they could make up a story
about a venezuelan
dictator and stuff of course they could
of course they could make that up
so could have been russian could have
been china could have been natural i
don't know here's another one
why is the united states so afraid of
nuclear energy
as a solution for our energy problems as
well as climate change
we know that
that point of view doesn't hold up
scientifically
but it is a common belief in america did
that come from america
and from people doing their own research
or is it china
who's making america believe that that
nuclear is not a good idea because that
would be one of the most clever things
china could ever do because they're
building nuclear plants like crazy there
obviously they think it's a good idea
but if they could convince us it wasn't
a good idea here
that would give them the future because
they would own space among other things
you need nuclear
nuclear industry to to occupy space
um
so how about
and then earlier i mentioned that the
only place you can buy
the green energy stuff is in china you
know the solar panels and stuff
so
is it possible that china
much like trump has suggested by calling
climate change a chinese hoax is it
possible that china is stoking our fears
in any way
to make it uh more likely we would buy
their their solar panels
and have a you know not very dependable
grid
now i'm not saying that's the case so i
want to be clear again i'm not
suggesting any of these are psyops but
that's what they would look like
they would look exactly like this
because it's things americans believe
that aren't true
that are damaging
i don't know did it come from us or did
it come from someplace else we don't
know
all right in brainwashing news
i've told you the cnn and those who are
trying to persuade you
as if they are your doctors
that you should get
the vaccinations
etc
and
the way that they're going to do it is
with visual persuasion
and fear
and take advantage of the fact that
we're bad at math
because if they show us anecdotal
stories of individual people having a
bad outcome because they didn't get
vaccinated
it's going to scare us it's going to
give you a picture of somebody who's
suffering
and
it's just strong persuasion even though
it's horrible
so now
cnn has a story about the 14 year old
who spent five days on oxygen after
getting covered so that's the headline
headline is five days on oxygen after
getting covered
and
what do you think
you would see if you looked at the
picture
well the picture doesn't show what the
words show the picture shows a 14 year
old who is unfortunately morbidly obese
that's not mentioned in the text
again you see this pattern over and over
and over again they'll show somebody
morbidly obese in this case a 14 year
old and showing them having a hard time
on the covet and never mention that the
weight is part of that
equation
and
uh again i'm not doing fat shaming we
don't do that
that's
you know i i disavow all fat shaming on
every level but you when you're talking
about health outcomes
you just can't lie to the public like
this
this is a lie
it's a lie because she was having a
problem with weight
plus covet
that was her problem
weight
plus covent
and it's being told as a coven story and
that's just fake news
but it's fake news and that what they
think i guess is in the service of the
country because it'll give us more
vaccinations
um
so that
is my content for today
um
i hope some of the uh
hope some of the folks from locals knew
to jump over here onto youtube the
locals live stream is still in
beta
so it's not available to all the
creators yet so when we get uh little
hiccups like this that's part of the
beta test so the reason i'm testing it
is to find out
if it has these problems
but it's been a great product so far
with a few hiccups
mike lindell isn't what
i'm seeing something about mike lindell
that i don't think is true
is it true that locals is hooking up
with rumble
i have nothing to report on that
um
trump wins bigly in 2024 where is trump
right isn't it another day of no trump
how many um
how many days of no trump controversy
can we go in a row
uh dominion whistleblower whoops hold on
this is breaking news
shows how machines were configured for
connection to the internet now well i
wouldn't put too much in that so
somebody's saying there's a nn here
saying there's a breaking news that
dominion whistleblower shows the video
machines being configured for connection
to the internet that doesn't mean they
were connected
so
whatever i'm reading here i wouldn't
take that too seriously until you know a
lot of context
i don't think anybody says that it's
impossible to connect them to the
internet
i don't believe anybody believe that
right so if
if they have the ability to connect to
the internet i don't know if that's news
is it
um have i considered using stream yard
yes
the
the products that um stream to multiple
platforms
uh have a
uh
have a stability problem which i'm
having right now but it's for a
different reason uh they have a
stability problem but there's also a
delay so the way i'm doing this right
now is on an ipad and i see myself
in real time
but on some of the softwares that do
streaming to multiply multiple platforms
because of speed constraints they'll
show me talking to myself at a
a few seconds behind
and you just can't even do the show that
way because you're watching yourself
basically it's sort of like have you
ever tried to do an interview with a
microphone and you've you hear yourself
in your ear
that's happened to me a number of times
doing satellite interviews i'll say
something and then i'll hear my own
voice echoed in my headphone like with
just a slight delay of half a second or
something you can't think or talk
it actually shuts down your ability
to think and talk at the same time
hearing yourself talk slightly and whack
so that's what happens with the the
products that stream from one platform
let's see it's beyond annoying yeah
let's see um
i can't even have a phone call yeah
that's totally true
all right
um
just looking at your comments for a
moment and i think we're done here
uh there's something about mike lindell
that's people are talking about but it
doesn't sound like it's a real
real story sounds like fake news so i
won't
um
oh have i talked to dr drew about his
setup well i've talked to
lots of people about their setups and
they all have the same problems
they're not stable
they've got a delay
it's the same set of problems but some
people are willing to deal with
different problems than other people
one of the things that dr drew and a lot
of other podcasters do is they have an
engineer or a producer
who is doing the troubleshooting
so you saw today that i couldn't do the
show and do the troubleshooting at the
same time
but because the nature of how i do this
as soon as i add
other people
it's going to turn into a different kind
of show
i don't want the production values to be
too good
if you know what i mean i like keeping
it casual because that's that's i think
that's part of its appeal
all right
it is better on a pc now i wouldn't use
a windows product for anything because
windows products just beg for
software updates all day long it's
basically having a dog
every time i go in the kitchen my dog
begs for a treat
every time i open a windows laptop it
begs for software it's like having a
freaking dog
you know i mean i love my dog but
it's hard to go in the kitchen and have
a dog begging for food and distress
because she's not having it every single
time you walk in the kitchen
absolutely false craig says i don't know
what you're referring to
are you talking about the microsoft
stuff
um
i'm not talking about microsoft's own
updates i'm talking about any any
software working on the platform it's
all banking for software all the time
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
