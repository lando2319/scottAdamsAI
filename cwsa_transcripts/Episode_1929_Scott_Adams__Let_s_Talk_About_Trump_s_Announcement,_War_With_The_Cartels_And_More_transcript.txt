ever experienced
do you think we'll be talking about
Trump's announcement oh yeah
Trump announces and the media pounces
you like that Trump announces and the
media bounces I'm very proud of that now
if you'd like to take this experience up
to the level where nobody's ever seen
before
all you need is a copper mugger a glass
of tanker jealous aside a canteen Jugger
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for them parallel pleasure
of the doping being here today the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous sip
and it happens now
go
uh we have a party fowl party fowl hold
on hold on Stephanie Jackson
your coffee is cold now uh Stephanie
Stephanie
I can't do everything for you
you need to be prepared
set your alarm a little bit early or
drink a little bit slower
try to hit the point try to hit the
point next time Stephanie
Stephanie we trust you we know you can
do it
take your game up a level
Stephanie
all right uh well
um FBI oh we'll talk about Trump but let
me give give a few minutes for people to
come in uh if the FBI's uh director Ray
says the FBI is quote extremely
concerned about Tick Tock operating in
the U.S
no they're not
no they're not do you know what
extremely concerned it looks like
the pandemic
extremely concerned is when you stop you
stop all travel from China
because there's a virus over there we're
extremely concerned we're all going to
wear masks and take vaccinations and
that's extremely concerned right
World War II
extremely concerned about Hitler so
concerned we mounted a you know an army
ourselves that attacked that's what
extremely concerned looks like do you
know what extremely concerned does not
look like
oh I'm extremely concerned
that's what it doesn't look like
extremely concerned would be at the very
minimum
turn it off
turn it off and then figure out if you
should turn it back on
you don't leave it on when you're
extremely concerned
you turn it off first figure out if
there's a problem maybe turn it back on
maybe
but it's just a flat lie that they're
extremely concerned
they're not
now here's what I believe is why they're
not extremely concerned I believe that
Republican and maybe just government
people uh ignorance is really killing us
because I believe this is a case of
ignorance and this is what I mean I
believe when the FBI thinks of tick tock
as a threat they think of the data
privacy part of the threat ooh China
will find out too much about our
citizens which is true
but that's not the threat the threat is
that they can program our brains
directly through through their product
do you think that the director of the
FBI even understands that
I say no
I would say his actions and his words
suggests he doesn't even know what the
threat is
he literally doesn't know what the
threat is because I would say that out
of a hundred people
only
two out of 100 would understand the
threat now most of my audience does
because I understand the threat so I
explained it to you but who explained it
to director Ray
yeah who who talked to director Ray who
has my level of
persuasion experience
and said to him oh you're missing the
Big Show here the show is that they're
programming our minds it's not about
data privacy I mean it's also about data
privacy that's not unimportant
but data privacy is something I would be
uh extremely concerned about but maybe
not doing that much about it right
doesn't that sound like he's only
extremely concerned about some data
privacy
if the question was uh you know they're
programming our brains or if they're not
actively doing it you know they could
turn it on at any minute
they they just turn a button you know
figuratively speaking and we get more of
something or less of something
The Tick Tock users do
why in the world does he pretend not to
understand that
now let me ask you have you ever heard
anybody in the government say what I
just said
that the real problem is that they're
programming us
I haven't learned it I've only heard
Dana privacy which means that our policy
is based on ignorance
I'm not wrong
I'm not wrong anybody who understood the
problem would have turned it off
immediately
do you know who understands the problem
Trump
does do you know why Trump understands
the problem
because he understands persuasion he
knows how he does it he knows that if
his message were on Tick Tock it would
be more effective
he tried to ban it now he got it shut
down and then you know that's on him a
little bit too
but trust but Trump actually understood
the the risk
do you know what so that's why extremely
concerned looks like
Trump was extremely concerned he tried
to turn it off that's what extremely
concern looks like
I'm not wrong
right
a little bit concerned is talking about
it extremely concerned you try to turn
it off
there's no argument there
uh Ivermectin continues to uh entertain
I did not think that the Ivermectin
story could be as deep as it is or last
as long
but listen to these two stories at the
same time
okay
now I'm not nothing about what I say
will be Pro or anti Ivermectin past that
conversation we're just going to talk
about how it how it's being handled in
the news right
so at the same time
The Daily Beast is calling out Dr Simone
gold
she was part of that group of Rogue
doctors have I ever mentioned
my opinion of Rogue doctors
the problem with Rogue doctors is
that for everyone that's like right and
you know sounding the alarm and we
should really listen to them those exist
there's going to be five War frauds
Maybe 10. maybe 10 who were frauds for
every real one who really got the right
answer first
so how do you know
how many of you believe that this uh Dr
Simone gold and her organization who
were genuine uh because it turns out
that uh
they're being called a coveted
disinformation organization of course
that has to do with their claims about
Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in
particular but apparently they raised a
ton of money and as founder the Simone
gold uh used some of that money to buy a
mansion where she lives with her 20
years younger underwear model boyfriend
she took a hundred thousand dollar
private jet trip
um and she actually went to jail for
January 6 protest where she was accused
of not using her medical training to
help it injured policeman
did that really happen
there's there's a report
that she was near somebody who got
injured and just kept protesting instead
of helping an injured person
she is a doctor
I don't know it's not illegal didn't
break any laws but so how many of you
thought that Dr Simone gold and their
hydroxychloroquine little organization
how many of you thought that they were
uh legitimate
is anybody saying oh I thought they
were real
anybody
well a lot of us a lot of us now to my
credit
I never thought they were real
can you confirm that for me that the
people have been watching me since the
beginning can you confirm that I always
called on that group confirmed
right
now I'm not saying the
hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin who
work or don't work I'm just too bored
with that conversation it'd be great to
know the answer someday but I'm bored
with that but I did call on it
so I get to win on that will you give me
the win
will you give me a clean win on calling
that yeah now but I want to be
clear I didn't call on the the
drugs
I don't I don't have a firm opinion on
that I have a I have a let's say
statistical opinion but I don't have any
certainty about it
all right so at the same time that we
found out that one prominent group
pushing Ivermectin and hydro
hydroxychloroquine who were apparently
more about the fundraising than the
science at the same time we find out
that this uh
uh that exchange FTX
apparently they were the major funder of
an Ivermectin study that debunked
Ivermectin
could this
be any more interesting
how in the world did this FDX get
connected to every
every ugly thing in the world
like it's just connected to everything
you don't like one way or another now
that doesn't mean that doesn't mean the
study was flawed
a lot of people said it was flawed I'm
no expert there but
don't you have to ask some pretty big
questions when a fraudulent organization
does a study that debunks something that
if it had been proven the other way
would have been you know this huge game
changer
you got to raise one eyebrow on that one
eyebrow up
all right uh let's talk about Twitter
2.0 I guess that that's what musk I
think musk is calling it that
so at midnight I guess he sent out last
night he sent out the staff an email to
everybody
that they have until 5 PM Thursday
to decide if they want to be part of
Twitter 2.0
now Twitter 2.0 will require as must
said long hours and a focus on
engineering
so it'll be kind of a big sacrifice and
very very difficult
um
what do you think of that
good management bad management because
we all get to watch
you know one of the great entrepreneurs
of our time
doing what he does
now Twitter apparently had a culture
that was maybe at a little bit of at
odds with the um let's say the the
startup mentality
so Twitter had gone past the startup
mentality and they were in sort of a
comfortable situation even though they
weren't making money oddly enough
and
I saw this uh in a in a related story
are you watching uh musk fire his own
employees on Twitter
oh my God
it's it's horrifying
at the same time it's electrifying
at the same time it's fascinating
at the same time it's
educational
it is everything it's like it's it's
funny it's horrible it's it's everything
but here's what I took from it there
were a number of employees who thought
it would be safe
to insult their the owner of their own
company
somewhere rudely in public
what caused them to think they could do
that
what was it that caused the Twitter
employees to think that they'd be safe
criticizing Elon Musk in public
they found out quickly that was not the
case
I don't know because we can't read their
minds
but let us speculate just for fun for
entertainment
don't they think don't you think they
thought they were kind of protected in
terms of free speech
they thought they had Free Speech but
other people didn't
[Laughter]
right they they thought they were free
to say that because it was their opinion
it was their honest opinion so they
thought well I could put my honest
opinion anywhere I want
because we got this free speech and
stuff
but it turns out
that you know companies don't have free
speech per se for employees and they
found that out musk trained them
now I do love the fact that musk is
making a very obvious big
you know psychological message that the
old way is dead
and you can only stay under the new
assumptions
I think he's doing a really good job in
communicating his priorities
I don't know if it'll work but I do
think he needed to do it
I would agree with at least from the
outside it looks like he couldn't just
take the existing staff and make them do
new things they're sort of old dogs who
needed to learn new tricks
so I think it's a combination of putting
in new blood plus you know weeding out
the the ones who think they have some
kind of
entitlement I guess
so he got rid of their free lunches
because they weren't eating it much and
it was expensive
and uh the other thing he did was uh
he's bringing back uh
can you give me the names uh the two
people
the two people who he fired from Twitter
he hired back
ligman Johnson ligman Johnson but they
were they were Pranksters so they did a
prank where the media thought they were
too fired Twitter employees but that was
just a prank they just stood outside the
headquarters with boxes
like they just cleaned out their their
desk which is freaking hilarious all
right so so uh
so
Moscow actually posed with a picture
with the two of them with his arms
around them saying welcome back to
Twitter
now you're definitely getting a uh
Advanced course on how to do marketing
without a marketing department
so has he proven for sure
the firing the Twitter marketing
department was a good move
okay are we given that
can we now say oh yeah well
you know because traffic is way up
attention on Twitter Twitter is way up
he's probably attracting engineers at
this point he's probably some people say
oh that could be interesting now I'll go
there
I don't know
yeah if you judge it by how angry the
employees say they are
it would look like a mess
right
but that's not how you judge things
because he's he's intentionally by
strategy
uh putting pressure on them
and that's capitalism and it's a free
market and you know they should be
fairly employable if they were working
on Twitter that should make you fairly
employable somewhere else
or maybe it works the other way I don't
know
um but watching musk fire people for
their opinions
is the ultimate Karma completes the loop
right because Twitter was under the you
know the company was sort of under the
operating assumption that they didn't
have to apply by Free Speech because
they were a private company or they were
a you know a company they weren't the
government
and now musk is uh informing them that
those same rules apply to them
that he can fire any employee he wants
because it's a private company
now it's private
so I know what Karma's really doing his
thing let's talk about Trump and his
announcement
um I missed the first few minutes
because I had some technical
difficulties last night but somebody
told me he used the phrase golden
golden age
did he say that the first two years were
a golden age
you know what's interesting about that
it might have been
a hundred percent of us would go back to
that wouldn't we because it was
pre-pandemic so you know you can't say
it's all about Biden it's the pandemic
as well but
golden age
huh
it's a catchy phrase I wonder where he
got it
um
I when I watched the presentation
I said to myself he is clearly keeping
his energy low
or he has low energy now he raised his
energy later so it looks like it was
intentional
and I was waiting for his critics to say
low energy
and low energy Jeb how long did it take
his critics to say it was a low energy
Jeb speech about a minute yeah I think
CNN Panda and MSNBC pundit uh bull said
low energy
now what did you think those of you saw
it did it look low energy to you or did
it look like he was trying to be more
serious
did it look like low energy or strategy
go low energy or strategy
serious or just low energy
strategy
I think it was both
I think it was both
but on top of that I think he might have
had some problem that day
I think he might have been a little sick
did anybody he looked nervous yes but
the nervous part didn't make sense
here here are some things we can
speculate
speculation number one
he was a little under the weather
do you think he's been getting much
sleep in the past week or so
I doubt it
imagine what his life was like before
making the announcement imagine the
conversations with his wife
imagine the conversation with Don Jr
with Eric with Ivanka
with Jared
and how many of them were saying dear
God do not run please please for the
good of the family
the family can't handle this you know
just
just take your win for the first term
and go away do you think that the family
was yeah
we're on your side let's do this
now I think they were all treating him
respectfully
but I don't think he was getting his
family on his side in the way that he
wanted when he when he introduced his
family he introduced Eric
right
yeah I think Eric was the family member
in attendance
correct me if I'm wrong by Eric had the
least role in his last election
right
I mean he was involved but he had the
the smallest role
but he was the only one at the
announcement now we do have reasons why
the others didn't come apparently Don Jr
was on a hunting trip and it was a
weather problem and he couldn't get home
does that sound true to you
do you think Don Junior was on a hunting
trip and he couldn't get home
could be yeah it could be because uh if
you follow him on Instagram his hunting
trips tend to be things like you know
fly somewhere and then you take a little
like a little aquatic playing into the
bush in Alaska and you know hunt bears
and take your little plane back and
stuff so he does do he does do the kind
of trips where if you were going to get
stranded for a few days because of
weather
yeah yeah but it's actually a perfectly
uh understandable thing now but let me
take it to the next level
if your father were going to announce
for the presidency
wouldn't you check the weather forecast
before you went to the trip
would you take that risk
would you take the risk that maybe you
couldn't get back
I don't know
um
we'll see I mean Don Jr retweeted the
announcement so he's he's showing
support on online it is plausible it's
plausible
but uh you have to ask the question I
can't imagine that the family is too
keen on on him running again it's hard
to imagine they would be
uh but Ivanka issued a
a very well written statement about why
she wasn't there
and I'll tell you Ivanka Just Nails it
every time
her statement was you know very
supportive you know unambiguously
supportive not the kind of
where you where you think they're using
weasel words to support it was just full
of support you know loving and support
uh but she said her kids are a certain
age
and then she mentioned the age of the
kids
and they're like six to eleven or
something they're in that range
somewhere that's exactly the age where
you don't want to be gone right well
really there's lots of Ages you don't
want to be gone but that one's really a
critical one isn't it that's like a
really important one so I'm I'm all on
board at Ivanka and not not sacrificing
her family for the good of the country
can we agree
I think she would be a huge asset
but I I don't think I want her to do
that I want her to take care of her kids
she earned it I mean she she did way
more than anybody would be expected to
do in the first Administration
ooh text me while I'm doing my show
how important is this
oh okay
um
I want to keep it classy rather than
rally wise yeah it looked like you
wanted to keep it classy all right
so let's uh let's analyze his uh
his persuasion
uh
do you think that his energy that he
showed
was good persuasion
did the because here's what here's what
I I saw I saw that even his critics were
having trouble
doing the it's a dark scary speech
the biggest problem with Trump is that
he scares Democrats am I right
he scares them
because he talks like you know they
think oh no it's Mussolini
when they see him talking and I will you
know kick everybody's butt and I will
make everything great and we will go to
Glory
they say that's a fascist
but if he talks like Chuck Schumer
yeah well we're we're gonna look at the
budget really hard and we're going to
take a look at this and try to get some
bipartisan support
right
so he tried he basically did his
impression of a boring politician
because that's what the public seems to
want
I think so so number one I don't think
it was 100 intentional
I don't think his energy level was a
hundred percent intentional I do think
he meant to keep it professional
so that part was intentional but the
energy
looked like there was something going on
with him in his personal life
would anybody disagree did anybody pick
up there's just something going on in
his personal life maybe the announcement
himself maybe some maybe sick maybe
something else
yeah
maybe old
at first I thought it was age but when
he got off the teleprompter he his
energy picked up and then he was closer
to his regular self
now here's another uh speculation
did it seem like he was having a hard
time seeing the teleprompter
I felt like he couldn't see the
teleprompter
okay do you think of a reason that would
be true I can
why would he not be able to see the
teleprompter in that event when in all
the other events he could
not age
but that's possible it's possible he
needs glasses
and won't wear them but I have a I have
another uh possibility I believe that
the professionals who do the you know
the technology at Mar-A-Lago are not the
same as the professionals who help a
president or a campaign
I think he's relying on less qualified
assistance at the moment
especially because he was home I mean he
was literally home
so whatever so here's my guess I think
they put the uh maybe you'll find the
sound but it looks like the
teleprompters were maybe too far away
or maybe you know too wide or something
maybe that's on you know glare on them
or something but he looked like he was
struggling to read it
and at one point I thought he read it
wrong like you said something that I
didn't even think made sense but he was
reading it
so I don't know that's what it looked
like I guess we have some questions
there
but
some said he had no new policy
suggestions
but he did say uh execute uh defend
execute dealers
drug dealers and they did say war on the
cartels
isn't that new
isn't that uh that's pretty new
and isn't it the most important issue so
did he manage to come up with something
bold and new on the most important issue
in the country in my opinion
and it was re it was reported as he
didn't say anything no
did that actually happen
yeah he just said attack Mexico and it
was reported as nothing new
so here we go right here we go
it's like first of all uh Daniel Dale
from CNN did a fact check on on Trump
but he was you know
he of course fact Jack everything is
false basically everything Trump said
was not true
which I picked up as well did you pick
that up
that most of what Trump said was not
true
you could all tell right
I mean I don't know what was true but
pretty much a the vast majority of his
claims were so out of context or just
completely made up
I mean yeah
now compare that to Biden's lies
they're a little bit different
you know you when when Trump is you know
slinging his
it sounds like a salesperson and it
sounds like you know big big first
offers and it sounds like he's
negotiating with the public and I feel
like I've
I feel it in context the context is you
know who Trump is
you know he overclaims and then you just
bake that into your thinking but with
Biden he's just lying it feels it feels
like a lower level
it's like they're both lying about
everything stipulated
stipulated they're both lying about
everything
and as presidents do
but I do think but I think one does it
with a salesman's Flair and one with the
politicians flare and it feels different
all right
um
let's talk about uh uh well we'll get
back to fentanyl in a minute here
um he didn't really have any visual
persuasion this time did he
it was visual in terms of he had
American flags behind him and blah blah
but
I'm talking about a visual for his
message
build the wall you could see the wall
he would just say it's a big beautiful
wall with a door in it and you just
would see it
he didn't really have anything that you
could see right I mean war on the
cartels is a little more concepty you
kind of see it but yeah he needs he
needs more of a visual
all right
so the other thing I have a complaint of
is he talked about bringing America back
to Glory
he wants America to go back to Glory he
said it twice maybe three times
that is a terrible word
yeah you get get rid of that word
what what does that sound like when you
hear it Glory
sounds like a fascist
that sounds like a fascist talk it'll
bring our we'll bring our country to
Glory
the European Empire the Third Reich the
glory
now who doesn't know that sounds that
way
like that I feel like he's off his game
a little bit there that's not a word you
should use three times that's a word you
should use zero times
so get rid of Glory that's just that's a
distraction
yeah there's a million ways to say that
without that word
all right
um
here's how the critics are talking about
his speech I heard this uh a couple of
times
that Trump is quote a twice impeached
insurrectionist
that's not an exact quote but didn't you
hear people saying twice impeached and
then January 6. he's a twice impeached
insurrectionist
foreign
it's I guess that's going to be their
go-to play because I don't think they
all thought of it as spontaneously
maybe they did
um I predicted that he might tease a
Kerry Lake just by mentioning her he
didn't mention her did he I didn't catch
every minute did he mention Carrie Lake
I don't think so nope he didn't mention
anybody by name who is a competitor
or in the race did he
I don't think he was naming names
oh he did mention Herschel Walker right
yeah I caught that okay yeah I don't
think he wanted to distract attention
from himself maybe that was the right
call
um it would have been more exciting if
he had teased a vice president but
it might not be a mistake to put the
attention on himself at this point
I could see that
um
here's here's an MSNBC opinion it
doesn't matter who said it I would give
credit to whoever said this but
doesn't matter it's the MSNBC opinion
and this is from a written piece but
it's no surprise Trump is trotting out
the same old trash the core of his
appeal after all includes a refusal to
admit failure
is that a core to his appeal
it's a feature
it's a feature
but is it is it in the top three
is that what his supporters think okay
you know
I really like it when he's wrong and he
doesn't admit it
that's what I like
yeah I'm not I don't care about all the
things he accomplished and the economy
but boy
yeah is that not admitting when he was
wrong thing
um I don't does MSNBC really think that
like that's the core of his appeal
and then they talked about him saying
that uh quote I think if they win I
should get all the credit uh if they
lose I should not be report that like
that was serious
like he actually said that as a matter
of fact oh yeah if I if they win I
should get all the credit if they lose
they should be their fault
it was clearly a joke
when he said it clearly it could not be
more clearly a joke but they they
reported it like he just said it like it
was serious
and here we go again
all right
uh and then they said he included in his
speech the usual racist dog whistles
did anybody hear any racist dog whistles
do I have a hearing problem
do I need to get my hearing checked
because I'm missing the whistles
well what would be an example of a
racist dog whistle in the speech
Glory
I understand I didn't hear all of it but
I didn't hear any
all right you didn't hear it either
yeah America but but the MSNBC people
can just like slip that into an opinion
piece without any kind of uh
exclamation explanation
all right let's talk about fentanyl
because that has a lot to do with uh
Trump
um
all right so you said he'd wage a war on
the cartels
and also he won a death penalty for the
dealers I think he was I think he meant
the fentanyl dealers and the big ones
but I'd like him to clarify that a
little bit better
somebody says stop making excuses for
his narcissism
so uh
tyranus
who whose name actually have a as anus
right in it did do you think that was
his narcissism when he smiled and said
I'll take credit if they win and it's
their fault if they lose you think that
was actually narcissism
yeah you think you think your therapist
would say well that's something I got to
work on
look at that narcissism
or would they say that's an obvious joke
well you decide
so since uh Trump does not say what wage
war on the cartels means there's no
reason to think it means any more than
we're already doing
don't you think
you know the border control people think
they're Waging War on the cartels by
seizing people as they come across and
stuff I don't know they probably think
they're already doing it so I don't know
a wage war on the cartels means but I
have some suggestions
I have some suggestions I heard somebody
complained that if we attacked the
cartel operations that the Mexican
Government would you know we can't do
that because the Mexican Government
would see it as an act of War
to which I said are you even
listening to me yes I'm I am promoting
an act of war against the Mexican
Government because they're owned by the
cartels and I also don't care what they
think
what are they going to do
attack us
is the Mexican Army going to invade the
United States
no they're just going to be really
unhappy and say things about it that's
it The Mexican government is not
relevant to this conversation
as soon as you imagine they're a regular
government like you know with a
government we should listen to and
respect and all that it's not that
they're owned by the cartels
obviously because the cartels couldn't
operate the way they do if the
government had any control
yeah the Mexican Army it must be owned
by the cartel obviously otherwise the
Mexican Army would you know take out the
cartel
um
so here's here's how I would do it I'd
drop a mother of all bombs on one cartel
operation
and that I tell them that's one
so they know there's more coming
now is the mother of all bombs the right
size Munitions for this job no no it
would be enormously oversized
would it kill uh innocent civilians
yes ones that are around the fentanyl
lab
I'm sorry
oops Yeah I mean nobody wants to kill
civilians you know I'm not a heartless
monster nobody wants that
but it's or
and if you're in a war and you're
standing next to a war asset you better
get out of the way
so I would drop a mother of Obama on and
whatever is a good Target
and let them know that's the level
that's coming
that's the level that's coming because
if you if you send in some people with
guns and so people shoot people
the cartel says well we have guns we'll
just get better guns and we'll we'll
fight you you want to drop a bomb on
them so there's nobody to shoot back
who are they going to shoot at the plane
the flu away
you want to make sure they have no
response they're just fewer of them and
then just keep doing it and then other
people said Scott Scott Scott
when did let's talk about the death
penalty so Trump also said death penalty
we assume he means the bigger fentanyl
dealers but that can use some
clarification
now somebody said Scott the death
penalty doesn't stop murder
so why would it stop Fentanyl what do
you think of that argument the death
penalty does not deter murder
which I believe is true
um why would it stop anything else
well I will see your analogy which is
useless
and I'll top it with my own analogy
which is useless
but at least it's you know equals your
analogy
it works with terrorism
the reason we haven't been attacked
I think or at least part of the reason
is that killing the leaders actually
works
killing the people who are good at it
means that they would have to be
replaced by people who are not so good
at it we're very or at the very least
less experienced right do you think that
9 11 would have happened without bin
Laden
probably not
right
and maybe he trained some people but if
you take out the you know top 10
terrorists from every organization what
what is the 11th best terrorist good at
probably not running a terrorist
organization
if you're the 11th best terrorist in the
in the group right
Paul says you're joking right no
no you take any organization and get rid
of the top 10 best people and what's
left
take Congress
take Congress and get rid of the top 10
effective people in Congress what do you
have left
nothing
there's nothing left
you've got fetterman
all right do you want fetterman uh you
know basically you need to kill the the
top guys until you get down to the
fetterman level of of uh cartel members
you know once you're down to fediment
level you can maybe ease off a little
bit because he's not gonna
it's not going to work that well all
right
um
let's see what else
but I also say that we should try
because maybe killing all the cartel uh
you know competent people wouldn't make
any difference you should still do it
because they're murderers
um
I was arguing that a small fentanyl
dealer you know somebody who sold a few
pills to a friend or something should
not be executed
but then I revised that
I said if you do it twice yeah just you
should be executed
if you do it once that's probably just
you doing a favor for a friend oh I
bought some extra pills here's some for
you I mean that's that's what the lowest
end dealing looks like just somebody
wants to pay for their own drugs so they
buy a little and sell it to some friends
like I don't want to kill that guy
unless it gets caught twice
the second time he does it yeah kill him
kill
that's where my head's at
um
let's see and I'd also like to point out
that
um
killing people who killing people to
reduce the murder rate
the the data doesn't suggest it works
but
I'm not a criminologist so I'm going to
need a little fact check on this how
many people are murdered by people
who've already been executed
there's a lot
the people who've already been executed
do they they still kill a lot of people
after they're dead as ghosts perhaps
because dope people who kill people
often kill more than one
I mean I'm not talking about a mass
murderer but if you're a person who's
killed one person
I feel like you might do it again
so I would think that a hundred percent
of the people who were likely to kill
more than one person didn't do it after
they died
I don't know
um
why do you think there hasn't been more
action on fentanyl from our government
what what's your theory
why there's not been more action on
fentanyl by our government
uh I believe it's
um I don't think it's money and
Corruption believe it or not I mean I
would easily go to that
you know I always go to corruption when
things don't make sense well it must be
corruption otherwise they'd be doing
something else
in this case I'm going to offer you
another hypothesis
Republican ignorance
I believe it's Republican ignorance
specifically Republican here's what I
mean
if if you randomly pick somebody in
Congress or Republican and say what are
we going to do about this fentanyl what
would they say
well with the typical Republican in
Congress say they're going to do to
battle
build the wall right
so because they have this build the wall
mentality which would never stop more
than five percent
they they're blinding themselves to
anything that might work
now they also want the wall for
political reasons
so the Republicans don't want to deal
with fentanyl
because if they deal with fentanyl they
can't argue for the wall
which they would want for other reasons
as well immigration for example
so the Republicans have trapped
themselves in the situation where they
need to argue wall wall wall
and it takes their ability to be
effective on fentanyl completely off the
field the Republicans have failed
completely failed completely because
they think the wall will make a
difference
now you want to know who a republican
who's not poorly informed because it's
not all of them
and I know some of you are not as fans
Dan Crenshaw
Dan Crenshaw apparently understands the
topic
do you know how I know that
because he's acting exactly like a
person who understands the topic
he has introduced some pretty severe
penalties for the cartels and dealers I
guess on fentanyl should be higher
penalties there would be Federal
penalties so he could bypass the soft
local prosecutors because the local
prosecutor is going to let you out of
jail for too easy stuff so the first
part is good you make it Federal
that sounds smart doesn't it
would you agree put it putting a federal
crime on that that feels like a good
move
I don't argue with that
um he wants to go after the financial
institutions that are hiding the cartel
money
we haven't already done that
all right I'm I'm disappointed that
there's something we could have done
that we didn't do already but if if
Crenshaw thinks there's something to do
there he's probably looked into it
by the way do you know that Crenshaw is
really smart
even if you disagree with them
he's really smart
so keep that in mind
um
yeah stiffer stiffer crimes revoking
naturalized citizenship and green cards
for those convicted of stuff stuff
so all of that's good
do you know it's not on his list
did you see what's missing
build the wall
that that's how I know that Dan Crenshaw
actually understands Fentanyl because
nowhere here he said build a wall
because he knows that's not the answer
right
so when you see the smart people acting
you can identify them right away
not smart I'll say well informed the
well-informed Republicans will not say
the wall is an answer it's just poorly
informed
does anybody disagree
right it's just the Republicans are the
problem because they're wall obsessed
and they can't get past it and
politically they need the walls so it's
wall wall
so they are the problem
uh Trump could possibly break that Log
Jam
um
there is a
an experimental vaccine
for making fentanyl not affect people
so the simulation really hates us
imagine if you will that there was one
solution to the fentanyl problem
just one
and it was a vaccine
oh
that was my shadow impression
really why why
does it need to be a vaccination
it couldn't be a pill
couldn't be a pill
it couldn't be treatment it couldn't be
Consulting
can be a Criminal action there couldn't
be military action it had to be a
vaccination really
now
it might have some potential I mean
vaccination raises all the red flags
that it should but apparently they
figured out how in mice they haven't
tried it in humans
but in mice it seems to turn off just
the fentanyl love
so so the so even if a person took it
and they became immune to Fentanyl
presumably there would still be
painkillers that worked on them
different kinds
because you don't want me you don't want
to make somebody immune to painkillers
that would be a bad idea so apparently
it's so specific
but
but
it's a vaccination
how long will they have to test this
thing before you put it in your body I
mean you wouldn't have to
all right
but it does it does start to suggest
that there might be a suite of things to
offer to addicts
you might offer them drug counseling you
might offer them the vaccination as long
as they can refuse you know
well-informed refusal
uh
yeah so there might be ways to go
to get people help
anyway that would be a game changer if
that really made a difference
all right
um
if the government doesn't do anything
about Fentanyl and it looks like they
won't you know because I don't know what
are the odds of trump getting elected
and them carrying through on war on the
cartels
20 percent
if you had to put the odds that Trump
first gets elected so you know maybe you
say that's a 50 50. I'm not sure where
you are on that but then he has to get
elected but then he actually has to do
what he said
she has to actually you know get enough
people in the government to say let's go
hard at the cartels
20 percent
maybe 20 25.
I don't know
but if the government continues not to
be effective here's what I think is
going to happen I think there's going to
be a fentanyl vigilantism
Fentanyl vigilantism
it could take several forms now I'm not
recommending it
because vigilantism ends up killing the
wrong people too
so it's a bad idea I'm only predicting
it's likely if the government continues
to do nothing
um
Scots against vaccinations now
all right chick girl you stupid you
get to be hidden on this channel
for being an
good job
here's what the vigilanteism would look
like
for everyone who deals Fentanyl
there's at least one person who would
like to knock them out but doesn't want
to get caught
there will be a website where you can
anonymously name fentanyl dealers
and I think people would use it
don't you think
because
yeah now I'm not I'm not recommending it
because as all the dangers you can
imagine in that kind of a system you
know people with trolls would be putting
you know people's names on it it'd just
be a mess
but you can imagine it happening
couldn't you imagine it
if I lived in a neighborhood where the
fentanyl dealers were like killing
everybody in my block I put that name on
the list
if it were Anonymous and I trusted that
now do you think that will happen it's
the obvious thing that would happen that
the you the public doesn't necessarily
have to kill these people
all they have to do is name them
they'll take care of itself
on it
because there's always going to be
somebody who wants to go take care of
business
uh I don't think they should
but it's going to happen
all right um here's another idea
um
How about if the penalty for dealing
fentanyl is to lose your privacy forever
that you would be like a uh
pedophile
that if you ever got convicted for
fentanyl you'd be put on the be like the
the pedophile list that anybody could
find out if they live near you
anybody could know if you if you should
be hired
yeah being being a fentanyl dealer if
you knew you were doing it I suppose it
might be different if you didn't know
you were doing it
maybe you just ostracize them
maybe you say yeah you we're not going
to kill you but you're sure as not
gonna live next to me
if you put a fentanyl dealer in my
neighborhood
I'd probably vandalize their house
[Laughter]
maybe every week
maybe it would be my new hobby
yeah I mean sometimes information is all
you need the the public will take care
of it
there are enough parents who lost a
child
they'll they'll just go kill these
people
which I don't recommend it's a bad idea
but it's going to happen
um
how about this one this is more
speculative
what happens when drone technology gets
better
and you can operate a drone from
anywhere
through let's say you know starlink or
something so you can sit on your couch
in Maryland
and operate a drone in Mexico like a
small one
now that would require somebody locally
to launch it
but maybe you could control it from
anywhere
do you think that people will be using
drones to murder cartel operatives in
Mexico while sitting on their couch in
America
because nobody will know whose drone it
was
could you randomize the drones so that
even the people who launched them don't
know exactly who's operating them
that they might know the the pool of
people who could operate them because
maybe you signed up for something but
nobody would know because it's an
encrypted signal let's say let's say
nobody could know who was actually
controlling it
do you think it's technically impossible
to make it anonymous
again I'm not recommending it I'm
predicting
the ones who say no
what would make it impossible
because you've got the signal that goes
all the way from America to everywhere
through starlink so you can reach it
through the internet
and
you could weaponize it
and you could just have somebody locally
launch it that's all possible
yeah so some of you say it's not
possible
you know the people who say stuff like
that is not possible end up being wrong
don't they
I usually bet on the it is possible
people I don't know if it's possible but
it might be
uh unfortunately it would work both ways
so the cartels would be using drones to
attack America but you know
so that's bad
apparently the GOP has gained among all
minority groups
which means all they lost was white
women
that's all right they lost white women
they didn't lose white men did they
I don't know
um oh women between a certain age
yeah let me ask you this
uh
what is the most hated demographic group
in America
right now
what is the most hated demographic group
is it white man or white women
foreign
I think it might be a toss-up
it's a bad time for white people
somebody says and Johnny Guitar he says
the Jews that's a joke we are not
anti-Semitic
as a call back to T.A
yeah I hated by whom it this is the
exact right question
I don't know I feel like there's a lot
of a lot of dislike going around
uh but it might be white women who are
the the most disliked at the moment they
may have taken over for white men who
have ruled that category for years
um
how in the world
how in the world does the left explain
that the the left is supposed to be the
you know the diversity party
how do they explain that all the diverse
the diverse people are moving to the
other party
here's how I explain it
it's really obvious now
that the Democratic party is a woman
party
I've been saying it for a while but it's
pretty obvious Now isn't it now the
first time I said it maybe
four years ago five years ago do you
remember those on locals especially do
you remember me saying that the
Democrats are the woman party
and I I don't feel like I sold that like
nobody was agreeing with me when I said
it
what do you think today
after after the midterms it's clear that
the the women are in charge right it's a
woman party and if you're a male and
black do you think they have anything
for you
at least if you become a republican
you'll be respected
you can at least you could at least bank
that
do you know what is the best success
strategy for a black man in America
the number one best guaranteed success
formula for a black man in America
identify as Republican
now of course that would have its own
you know social backlash and stuff but
is there anything that white Republicans
like better than a black
Republican who is doing it for the right
reasons like he's not pretending
they love it because it makes them feel
smart
right when people join your team
you feel like oh I guess I was on the
right team look at that I guess those
diversity people and Democrats were the
wrong tape if they were the right team
things would be moving the other way but
you're coming my way I like that
and
I don't think I've ever seen a black
Republican man to fail
I feel like they all succeed
because you know they've got the right
strategy and there's nothing really
stopping them
so
um
that's what I'd do
ah speaking
so Instagram has become a cesspool of
bad relationship advice
I like really bad relationships advice
some of the worst stuff you'll ever see
in your life that is distributed with
great confidence now here's something I
saw today and I do not
necessarily think this is true all right
I'm only reporting what somebody on
Instagram who got a lot of attention
said there's apparently some kind of app
where a woman can calculate her odds of
finding the right man or it might be
just a census app
so it might not be for that purpose but
it could be used for that but uh so
there's a man on Instagram I didn't
catch his name and he was doing the
calculation he goes all right you're
you're a woman in America
and you're looking for a man let's say
between 28 and 45
right you're looking to get looking to
get serious she looks so you put in all
right it's got to be a man for a sort
you've got to be you know under 45.
I'll take any race no restrictions so I
have the biggest possible pool
um well I'm going to limit the men who
are under five foot nine this was the
gentleman's uh example he goes yeah you
know women like taller men so we'll
eliminate it under under five foot nine
then we'll also eliminate the obese
because you know women are not looking
for an obese guy according to this guy
and you want the women want somebody who
can make over 100k a year and is not
married
uh so how many what percentage what are
the odds
that you can find this guy he's young
he's any race he's tall he's thin
he makes over 100 a year and he's still
available
5.6 5.6
and there there's a theme going on
there's a theme on Instagram anyway of
uh both women and men
telling women that they set their
standards too high
have you all seen that it's like it's
just all over Instagram men and women
saying the same thing women you're
setting your standards way too high
and you don't have anything to offer us
I mean both the men and the women are
saying that women don't have anything to
offer
what am I getting I'm not getting
loyalty I'm not getting money I'm not
getting protection I'm having I guess
some kids that get taken away from me
what's in it for me
and and it's it's hilarious to watch
women try to answer the question
uh
and then part of this theme or not I saw
another video where uh an older couple
were jokingly reading a advice from the
50s on how to be a good wife
and the advice from the 50s was you know
is all this you know old sexy stuff you
know uh make sure you take off his shoes
when he comes home and don't talk loud
because he's had a tough day and don't
don't tell him any of your problems he's
got enough all this stuff and the in the
uh the the people reading it are sort of
laughing like you know haha
this would never work today and all that
and I'm thinking to myself okay the the
specific examples maybe not you know not
taking the shoes off or something
but
if both the couples are not thinking how
can I make that other one happy
and actually putting in the work every
day to do it
it's not going to work
so I've got a feeling they were laughing
at something that worked
I had lots of you know problems of its
own in that sexist time
so it's not something I go back to but I
think they might be missing the
thrown out the baby with a bath water
there
uh let's so I was curious there was a
story about what celebrities lost money
with this FTX thing
and one of them was Stephen Curry
I would love to know how much
you know anybody puts in crypto I don't
know how much they had yeah uh I guess
Tom Brady actually invested in the
company itself oh
uh
so we have learned that people who are
great athletes uh and actors are not so
good at making uh investment decisions
now I will I will take all of that back
if it was you know two percent of their
wealth or something because two percent
putting two percent into some crypto
thing
that's not crazy
that's not crazy
but if it was a lot of money
they need some better advisors
a little bit better advisors
question on Ukraine
how is it possible that Russia taking
out power plants as winter is
approaching in Ukraine how is that not a
war crime
is it a war crime and we just know that
we can't do anything about it so
nobody's treating it that way you know
why isn't the Hague or somebody saying
it's a war crime
no way
power plants are military assets but you
know really
you know if you're taking out the power
plant for a Kiev that's a military asset
it's a military asset if you're sending
in your ground troops but if you're not
sending in your ground troops to you
know conquer it and then turn the power
back on
then it's just a war crime isn't it
we did we did it in Iraq and I'm saying
that it does make sense for an act of
invasion in an act of invasion yeah
anything that gives any the the military
any
ability you take out but they're not
really actively invading you know the
bulk of Ukraine I feel like that's just
got to be a war crime
right
uh NATO attacked civilians in the East
somebody says
uh Russia
read the J on reach a on Urban Warfare
huh dual use facility is not necessarily
a war crime
really
the the civilian power plant is dual use
I mean I get it you know it might be a
base there or something but I don't know
I feel the people who suffer would not
be the military because the military
could operate you know independent of a
power plant but civilians cannot
no more of a war crime than something
well
I think if you're not aiming at military
people it's just got to be a war crime
all right I don't know we'll look into
that
what else is going on
that's about it
let me give a summary on uh Trump
um if if his strategy
is to act like the reasonable person
it could work
because what we saw in Trump yesterday
was a low enough energy that you could
almost call it the the Hayden Biden
election strategy what is the one thing
that would be the worst thing for Trump
running for re-election what's the worst
thing he could do
say something outrageous yeah go
bombastic uh
yeah just go a little crazy and scare
the women
he literally scares women and men who
are woman-like
not an insult
let me clarify that when I say he scares
women and men who are woman-like
that I'm not anti anything I'm just
saying that such people exist that's
that's the whole point of the lgbtq
idea is that there are people all over
the Spectrum so I'm just agreeing with
that there are people all over the
Spectrum and that the Democrats seem to
attract
the less dominant type of males on
average
that that's just an observation I don't
have any science to back that up but it
looks like it I mean to me it seems
obvious
so if Trump's biggest problem is that
he's actually a scary character
people who are confident
like it
you know if you put me in a room with a
scary character
I'm happy
you know if he's on my side
like hey scary character let's have
lunch
because you know I'm a scary character
as well let me say this about men I
don't I'm just going to throw this in
here
um I've sometimes heard that
uh
you know the the larger the man the
safer you're going to be
a science to suggests that because any
man can kill any other man
that's the that's the beauty of being
male
no matter who I meet
and no matter how threatening or
dangerous or big they are I know I can
kill them
I just have to run away
get a gun find out where they live hunt
them down right but bye could
now you know if they grabbed me and
killed me then well then no but that's
pretty rare
right so the fact the fact is that any
man can kill any other man and we all
know it we all know it right so Size
Matters in limited situations yeah if
you were going to do uh you know like
you're in the fight yeah Size Matters
but there aren't that many fights where
that sort of I've never been in that
situation have you
how many of you have ever been in a
situation
where uh
where your size mattered
let's say for males
just just males men have you ever been
in a situation that was like you know
dangerous but your size mattered
some say some say yes
I think it matters if you can intimidate
people out of fighting
you could certainly break up a fight
easier if you're bigger that's something
but but let me put it this way if I had
to protect
a woman
do you think somebody could get past me
not without getting seriously hurt
like yeah a big guy could kill me
but they would never be the same
right you you wouldn't you wouldn't walk
away from that the same and if I and if
I recovered
I'm coming for you
right it doesn't matter how long it
takes if I recover I'm coming for you so
that's that's like the promise all men
make to each other if you do something
to me I am coming for you
so that does keep civilization a little
bit together so if Trump is trying to be
less scary
and less provocative
I buy it if he decided to put all of his
provocation on Fentanyl
he's got a really strong package
I I I hate to say it
but he's getting closer to making me a
supporter I'm definitely not
all right I'm not on board with him or
anyone else I need a fence and I'll plan
I'm a single issue voter I'm not going
to change
so he's the one who's talked the
toughest but I'd need a lot more details
on that like what does it mean to go to
war with the cartel
if that doesn't mean bomb the out
of them then it doesn't mean anything
do you agree
like I need to say he's going to bomb
them
and then I'm on board
uh maybe
so I don't think he offered much new
except the Fentanyl and the Mars thing
is more of a musk thing than a
than a trump thing so I'm not sure that
helped anything but I would like to see
him
you know have a little bit more meat on
the bones you know part of the problem
is that you know exactly what it is
uh we'll talk about pens we know we know
exactly what Trump will give you
you don't have to wonder if he likes low
taxes you don't have to wonder you know
how he would deal with other countries
we know well you know so he does need to
add something that people can talk about
like a new thing that we can talk about
but you kind of know what you're going
to get
um
I haven't seen Jason whitlock's take on
that now
all right Pence apparently Pence is
running
um
is that a problem
you know I mean it's only it's only a
problem in the primaries but I can't see
Pence draving off enough support
to pull out of trump
what he might do
here's what I could imagine
I can imagine four Republicans getting
in in addition to Trump
and everybody gets drawn down to 20
support
I can see that and then it's then it's
anybody's bed
because there might be some people who
say you know I love Trump but you know
Pompeo is at least
a little more stable you might say or I
love Trump but no Pence did a good job I
feel like
uh yeah no I forget it now there there's
there are no Republicans that could take
Trump below the winning number for the
primary
you don't think so do you I don't see
there I don't see any way he loses the
primary do you
yeah
uh
I I just saw a prompt on there uh Elon
Musk uh tweeted that he is the taint
because he was standing between the the
two Pranksters
yeah so he referred to them as being
between the two of them as being the
taint
he really doesn't need a marketing
department at all
at all
all right
um
let me get your opinion give me your
opinion on the
Trump uh announcement speech just the
speech itself so give me a uh quality of
the speech ranking and do it with just a
few words
you know what what would be the few
words
that would describe somebody says 10 out
of 10.
some say lost his Edge math nine
rambling a plus a plus yeah didn't watch
effective seven out of ten
so once again the human Rorschach test
does his thing
Trump does something in front of
everybody
and we can't decide if it was a huge
failure or the best he's ever done
just like normal
so our Two Worlds just bifurcate
instantly as soon as Trump is the topic
and that Retreat to your bubble it was
either the best thing that everybody did
or it was a it was a big old mess from a
twice impeached insurrectionist
yeah
so here we go here we go
uh
his dress was golden white yeah
it was too long maybe so
uh you noticed he flubbed a lot of words
see I think that might have had to do
with he couldn't read the teleprompter
for one reason or another I think the
teleprompter people have some explaining
to do don't you I just feel like it
wasn't big enough or close enough or
something
oh you think you slurred see that I
think he was exhausted
I think he was emotionally and
physically exhausted
in an unusual way because I think he
gets energized by you know working and
campaigning but he probably had a really
tough time with his closest family and
friends for the past week I I think
Trump probably got the beat out of
him by everybody and then decided to do
it anyway
because that's Trump
yeah now let me ask you this do you
think so far let's just let's just look
at the announcement
do you think that Trump made it all
about Trump or did he make it about the
country
did he make it all about Trump or did he
focus on the country
a little bit of both a little bit of
both yeah I think I think he focused a
little bit more in the country and that
felt felt right
all right
um if Trump
solidifies his fentanyl message
I think he wins
I think he wins
without the fentanyl message being you
know first rate
it'll be a little tougher you know some
say that uh some say Trump's the only
Republican who can't win the general
but Trump plus a fentanyl plan
it's all over
if if Trump brings a real fentanyl plan
and he just says all the other stuff is
just what you think it'll be it's
exactly what you think you know me you
know what I'm gonna do
it's exactly what you think that's what
you're gonna get you know energy is
going to be Unleashed regulations will
be decreased you know I'll uh I'll talk
to all the dictators even if you think I
shouldn't know exactly what you get
but also you can imagine him saying I'm
going to treat the biggest problem in
the country like it's the biggest
problem in the country
if he said that
I don't know how he could lose
I don't know how he could lose
now he'd also have to not say you know
provocative things that could be taken
out of context but there's always a way
you could lose so you never know all
right that's All For You YouTube thanks
for joining
I'll talk to you tomorrow
