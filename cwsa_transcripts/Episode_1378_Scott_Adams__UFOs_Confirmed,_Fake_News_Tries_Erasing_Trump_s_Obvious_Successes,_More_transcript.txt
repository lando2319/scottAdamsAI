well ladies and gentlemen and
everybody undefined
it's good that you found me today
because you're going to learn so much
you're going to have a great time you're
going to be connected to people all over
the world yeah it's almost like one of
those mushroom things
you know how
how mushrooms are all connected with a
deep network of
connections yeah it's exactly like the
simultaneous sip but with mushrooms
so if you'd like to enjoy the
simultaneous sip to its maximum
possibility
and why would you settle for anything
less really all you need is a copper mug
of glass to tank your chelsea stein
canteen drug flask vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous
sip
and it's the best thing that's ever
happened in the history of civilization
and it's just about to happen now go
you know
every morning i prepare for these live
streams by making notes and printing
them out on my hp tango printer
so i've usually got quite a bit
so i've got this page
you can see front and back um and then
my printer printed this page
and then my printer printed this page
and then oh but it's not all bad it also
printed this page which almost has some
smudges on it
um and when i tell you that you would be
watching me throw my printer off the
balcony
i'm not kidding
the only thing preventing that is that
other people are asleep in the house
right now otherwise you would be
watching me heave it off of my balcony
onto my side to walk below
now i'm not promising i won't do that
before the end of this live stream
if i hear other people wake up
so
if i know that the rest of the people in
the house are awake
that printer is going off the balcony
and you can join in the fun however
luckily
i've got a backup
technology
all right here's the good news
texas governor abbott reports
that the number of coveted related
deaths in texas yesterday was
zero
zero
texas
the whole state of texas
zero cover deaths yesterday
wow
now it's not going to stay at zero of
course
but
wow they had the lowest seven day covet
positivity rate ever
lowest coverage hospitalization in 11
months
wow
wow amazing
so i was out last night
going to dinner
and i gotta tell you my my little town
is so hoppin
i mean there is some pent up energy let
me tell you
the the number of people who are out you
can't park
you know if stores are just packed the
restaurants you can't get a reservation
it is hopping where i am now is it where
you are traffic is crazy again
yeah vaccines are working
so um
new york the washington post has an
interesting analysis
if you can call it that
and one of their claims in this article
is that because israel has the iron dome
which is pretty good at shooting down
the incoming rockets coming from gaza
that that's making it harder to get
peace
because why would israel
need any peace if they're stopping 90 of
the rockets
now
is that a good analysis
that the reason you can't get peace
is because the the
is that one of the sides is too strong
um i i think that we should not
discourage people from having a strong
national defense
because it might prevent them from suing
for peace that they don't need and don't
want
i would say that israel is in a good
position they don't need any peace
so what is better
than having a peace you don't want and
probably wouldn't hold anyway versus
having
you know a dominant control
of your own security situation
i feel like
i feel like peace isn't even the first
choice is it
because it wouldn't be a real beast yeah
there would still be terrorists doing
what terrorists do you could get maybe
the leaders to agree
but it wouldn't stop the terrorists
so i don't think that
israel has any
reason for peace with gaza let's say
they just don't have any reason
there's nothing to be gained as long as
they have a dominant
uh situation
so
you know and israel is getting bigger
and stronger every day so whatever
they're doing is working and
they get situations like this and they
take care of it
probably be done in a month before it
flares up again later
somebody says palestinians use peace to
get money from their wars
well there's definitely a monetary
incentive to everything
all right
um
so we're also seeing uh the news trying
to ruin
trump's legacy
about the abraham accords
now watch watch the fake news do this
what they're trying to do
is they're trying to say that the
abraham accords were really about
the palestinian situation even though
and you know nobody involved in the
palestinian situation
directly was even part of it
but the idea was that if israel and the
other arab countries got along
maybe it would isolate
the palestinians and
possibly cause them to be a little more
flexible
if if indeed that's what it takes
but you're seeing the news trying to say
that the trouble with israel and the
palestinians
is somehow negating
one of the greatest accomplishments of
all time diplomatically which is the
abrahamic courts
so watch how the news tries to make
these two different things into one
thing
now i would argue
that the abraham accords are holding
meaning that the other arab countries
are not
you know they're not jumping on israel
and pulling out of the accord
obviously
it's a giant success
obviously you just look at it and you
say to yourself wait did israel and
those countries that made an agreement
with it
still keep their agreement yeah
even when the
gaza is uh hurling rockets and and
israel's responding is still held
so it's exactly what it was intended to
do
which is isolate the palestinian
situation
and maybe make that easier to either
deal with or to solve in the long run
so
it is disgusting to watch the fake news
try to turn a gigantic success
into a failure by making it look like it
was really intended to do something
directly
with the palestinian violence which
didn't it was never meant to be a direct
uh address to that problem
um
matthew mcconaughey is
apparently quietly putting out fuelers
to see if he should run for uh governor
now apparently he polls
uh so high that he might actually win if
the polling were accurate and held
now what do you think of that
do you think that whatever problems we
have
will be solved by a governor matthew
mcconaughey
well
i liked him a lot more before he did
that uh those lincoln commercials
is it lincoln
where it just is so cringy from
beginning to end
i don't know
uh he apparently does have he's got a
college degree and
some kind of uh
i think the arts
um or some some kind of bachelor of
science and some kind of communication
or arts sort of thing
so and he was thinking about a law being
a lawyer at one point so apparently he's
academically smart
so he's got that working for him
academically quite smart
and
he's well-meaning
and probably liked by both democrats and
republicans to some extent
i don't know if he needs to be governor
because i don't know that there's a
problem there in the first place i mean
does governor abbott
is he doing a bad job that i don't know
about
i mean i've heard criticisms but all the
all the governors are getting criticized
so i don't know if this is a problem
that needs to be solved but
i feel like
there's something terribly broken with
the world
if matthew mcconaughey can become
governor
or somebody says he wrote a book too
um
you know i think reagan was a different
animal because he was always political
even when he was an actor
uh but i don't know
i just don't know about actors becoming
governors
just doesn't feel like a good
a good trend for the long time long term
you know arguably even arnold
schwarzenegger was kind of political
before he ran for office
all right
uh how many of you saw the 60 minutes on
the ufos
so there's there are more videos of
alleged ufos which tend to be these oval
shaped objects
which they never get a good picture of
but they can definitely see it on the
infrared and on the radar
so we know something's
there i feel like it's fair to say
there's
something
and when we say ufos are confirmed which
i cheekily did in my tweet about this
live stream
confirming a ufo isn't anything
it's like confirming that there's
confusion
it doesn't confirm anything it just
confirms that we don't know what they
are
so when you say it ufos are confirmed of
course people think you've confirmed
aliens
but nothing like that has happened all
right so here's the question
there was at least one part of the 60
minutes apart that i hadn't heard before
there were four pilots
in the same situation i guess it might
have been two jets with two pilots each
and they they
all four of them saw the same thing they
report that there was some oval object
making the ocean swirl and then it flew
away and it went right past them and you
know they could they could clearly see
it etc and they didn't want to talk
about it until now
and so you have to ask yourself
what is more likely
that four people really saw something
that is not of earthly design because
apparently
it was doing things that earth
technology can't do
or they always seem to do that
is it more likely that four people
are
lying or mistaken
or
is it more likely
that
that there are aliens who are visiting
with advanced technology
which one of those is
more likely
well let's put it in context
most of our headlines
are about things that people see that
aren't there
right
most of our hoaxes
and in fact most of our headlines even
today today just pick a day
most of our headlines
today
are about things that people saw
that weren't there
it's most of the news
most of your experience
every day
involves people clearly seeing things
that aren't there your co-workers
remember a conversation that didn't
happen the news is reporting something
that didn't happen
i i just gave you an example you'll be a
few more before we're done
so
one hypothesis that four people could
have the same crazy
hallucination
or just mistaken perception
that is the most common thing in the
entire world
it feels like it's not right because we
all think that our perceptions are
pretty good
so we think well our perceptions are
good other peoples must be at least a
little bit good
so it seems like it would be really
unusual that four people would see a
ufo
right up close
and they'd be military people and they'd
have the same story
what are the odds that that didn't
really happen
really high
really high
like
close to 100 high
it's the most common thing
in your experience is that people see
things that aren't there
now
how common is it in all of our
experience
to see a confirmed
alien spaceship
well
so far none
in in the history of civilization
so far none
confirmed
but
we certainly have lots of stories about
them
now if you have one situation which is
the most common situation in reality
people saying things that don't exist
even when multiple people see it very
common
versus something that's never happened
and
would be extraordinary and violate
physics if it did
kind of equal odds would you say no
not even close
if i if i could bet my entire net wealth
and and have a certain answer you know
hypothetically if you could know for
sure
i would bet my entire net wealth
that is not an alien spaceship
now i don't even know if it's a
spaceship could be anything
but we'll maybe someday we'll know
here's another uh news that i'd say i'm
a little skeptical of apparel there's a
story in usa today
that a uh a woman who is a black
homeowner
had her home appraised twice
and worried that she was getting a low
appraisal because she was black
so she decided to do an experiment in
which he got a white family to pretend
it was their house
and then the third appraisal of their
house was double
double what the first two were
so
clear racism right what else could it be
i mean it's in the news so it must be
true
i can't imagine that the news would
report something that's totally untrue
but do you believe that one woman's
house
was appraised
by two people for i guess 110 125
and then the third one
was double it was like 249 000 or
something like that
do you think that sounds plausible
because the usa today reported it like
it's true
no it's not plausible
it's not
it's not even slightly plausible
and you should see the comments on the
the tweet from people who do appraisals
for a living the people who do
appraisals for a living say
nope
not possible
because you have to show your work
the appraisal business is about
comparables
finding other homes that are sold
for a certain price
that are similar
if the appraisal doesn't show that the
other homes in your area sold for a
similar price
you're not going to turn then you're not
going to turn in that appraisal
because your own appraisal would say
it's fake
here are all the other houses just like
yours
and then here's yours completely
different than all the other houses like
yours
and we're going to just keep it that way
because we're appraising it for half of
what all the other houses are worth do
you think that happened
no
no it didn't happen
now some people are speculating that
what did happen is that the first two
appraisals uh i think we do know this
was during the
the
the depths of the coronavirus problem
when nothing looked like it was worth
anything
and then the third appraisal happened
when things were picking up the stock
market was up by 50 percent or whatever
whatever the number was
and home values were zooming
so
but still
doubled do you think your home doubled
no i don't know what the real story is
but this is not real
all right
and have i told you about stories that
are a little bit too on the nose
a little bit too on the nose isn't it
the the clever black single mom i think
actually
i think she's a single mom i'm not sure
about that part
but
you know she she's
she's a victim of racism so bad that her
home was praised at half of its value
no that didn't happen i'm sorry now if
i'd seen this story and said there's a
30 difference
i wouldn't have even questioned it
really i mean i would have been
horrified if there was a if there were a
30 difference
that would be horrifying
but i might have believed it
but not double
come on i mean the news isn't even
trying anymore when they report stories
like this they're just so obviously not
true
remember i told you that the
the disagreement between dr fauci and
rand paul
about whether uh fauci had ever
supported funding for gain of function
stuff in uhan
and i said to you that my theory was
that they were both
correct
disagreeing
but both correct and the reason that i
gave
is that gain of function was probably
being used in two different ways
so that they were both right they were
just using the the phrase differently
and i feel like that's confirmed now let
me tell you what the collins who's the
head of the nih said and i want to
listen to his exact wording all right
so here he'll be denying that they were
involved in any funding for a
gain of a
gain of what do you call it
so here's what he says quote let me be
very clear we never approved any grant
that would have supported gain of
function circ research on dangerous
coronaviruses
okay keyword dangerous
to see if they could be more
transmissible or lethal for individuals
in the human species he added
and they said
that was not something that we would
have done
now watch the exact wording here we
never approved that kind of research
and that's something senator paul might
want to be a bit more clear about
that kind of research
so he starts out by saying
talking about
gain of function
on dangerous coronaviruses and he says
we never funded that kind of research
but
gain and function as a big category
and gain a function to weaponize it is a
subset of that category
so
is it true that they did
non-weaponized research on gain of
function
but they did not
fund in any way
weaponizing gain of function
i feel like that's what's going on so
this looks like fake news
meaning that it looks like there's a
disagreement but they're just using the
words differently i think
that's my that's my current hypothesis
do you remember project veritas said
that had an under undercover video of a
cnn
a technical director i think he was
and
he was saying about cnn plans to panic
us about the climate as their next big
theme that they'll weave into everything
well here's your example of your cnn
climate panic porn
and ever
so their tweet today in an ever warming
climate
ripple effects or chain reactions could
lead to altered weather patterns across
the globe thanks to a melting antarctic
ice sheet a new study says
so
[Music]
here's my problem
what would happen
if we knew that let's say we knew
that the fake news was damaging people's
brains
because they were getting too afraid
they were frightened to death about
white supremacists under the bed
now they're frightened to death that the
arctic ice sheet will cause you know the
earth to fall apart from global change
global climate change
what would happen to your brain
if you were believing the news
it would be massive mental health
problems right
now here's my question
if the news
created massive mental health problems
for profit
you know they're not they're not trying
to give you mental health problems
but it's an outcome of all the fake news
who would report it if it were happening
that's a problem isn't it if the problem
was you know imagine hypothetically it's
a massive
mental health problem directly caused by
fake news
who would report it
who would report it
there's nobody to report it
right
it's one of the biggest problems in the
country by far
but the news can't report it
this is one where even you know fox news
can't even report it about cnn cnn can't
even report that about fox news and they
fight all the time
but reporting it would require accepting
that you're both at least a little bit
part of that process
so the news can't report
on what might be the biggest story in
the country right now massive
mental health problems
from the news
now
is there any science to support that
apparently yes
apparently there's plenty of science
are we following the science and
reporting that the news is creating
massive mental health problems
nope nope we don't follow the news in
that case
will climate change become a precursor
for war under the bush doctrine well
that's interesting
i feel as if
climate change and racism have the same
overall quality
that you can apply them to every other
topic
everything could be something about
racism everything could be something
about climate change you can make those
fit
anything
so will somebody use it to justify a war
definitely
yeah we don't know the details but we
know climate change will be will be used
to justify
everything
all right
um
now how about uh
i just saw a mention of the new york
times article ben
was it ben smith
yeah ben smith was writing in new york
times about the story about the jeopardy
contestant
who won three times in a row but when
he's
the first time he held up one finger the
second time he won he held up two to
show he'd won twice
and the third time when he held up three
fingers he unfortunately decided not to
do these three fingers
but to do the
these i can't do it
without i can't i can't give you an
example but uh he used like a uh a
catcher in baseball
uses uh uses these three fingers to say
three
and
apparently there was a big organization
of past participants on jeopardy
it's a thriving
you know sub community on the internet
and they decided that he was really
sending the secret white supremacist
hand gesture
now ben smith just rips that apart and
essentially just treats it like nonsense
and the tone of ben's article
is that all of these
past jeopardy contestants
who are by definition
way smarter about facts
than the average person
were completely bamboozled
by the belief that they could see a
white supremacist right in front of them
now
ufos some people believe exist
because so many people saw it with their
own eyes
with their own eyes they saw it they saw
the ufos so therefore they must exist
right well
several million people saw this poor
jeopardy contestant
look like a white supremacist
and apparently he's not
so
um
is this mental health problem
i think yes
i think it is
i'm saying that the uh the news should
be covered by the fda
maybe should the news
be regulated by the
fda because it's like a drug
you could make that argument i mean it
would never fly
but from a scientific perspective yeah
you could make that argument
um
so are uh
can we say that there's a massive mental
health problem because all of these
jeopardy contestants thought they saw
something that didn't exist
yeah yeah we can
to me that looks exactly like
proof of a major mental illness caused
by the fake news
um
538 is reporting that nearly every
republican who voted to impeach trump
including liz cheney
has been either admonished by the party
or attracted at least one primary
challenger
so it really kind of suggests that trump
is still in charge of the republican
party
because he can take out anybody who
opposed him
if trump can still take out and i think
he can
anybody who opposed him
how is anybody
going to prevent him from being
nominated again
i mean i'm not saying you'd want to
prevent it i'm just saying
it feels like nothing can stop it at
this point
i i feel like trump can just take out
one person after another until
until the field is clear
so i don't know that that's going to
happen but it's certainly possible
all right here's some fake news alert
so you may have seen some video clips of
the director of the cdc
rachelle wallensky
and
she mentioned there that we now have and
this was mentioned in a tweet on this
week abc news
said uh
let's see she's quoted as saying we now
have science that has really just
evolved in the last two weeks
that demonstrates that these vaccines
are safe they are effective
what
wait what what did i just say
are you telling me
that the head of the cdc
only found out in the last two weeks
that the vaccines are safe and effective
that's what the tweet says
and it's a tweet from this week abc
that wouldn't be fake news right i mean
they wouldn't they wouldn't just
blatantly tweet out
a complete falsehood
would they
but it looks like they're saying that
the cdc just figured out that vaccines
are safe
that's what the quote says i'm reading
it with my own eyes
it's got to be true
because i'm looking at it
right if you see it with your own eyes
it's true
isn't that what we've all learned no
i hope not no you see it with your own
eyes it doesn't mean anything doesn't
mean it's true
at all in fact
the tweet is completely misleading
compared to the situation so i listened
to the full clip and the the tweet is
just misleading
of course they've known that the
vaccinations had passed all the testing
of course they knew the vaccines were
safe
there was more to the statement this is
a rupaur
she got the the statement was kind of
cut off
so that uh it looked like she was just
talking about the safety of the vaccines
as if they had just discovered it this
week or last week
no
the specific thing she said is that we
just discovered like in the last few
days that if you're vaccinated
but you also get the
the coronavirus
which can happen
you basically can't spread it
that's a big deal
that's a gigantic big deal
that you can't spread it even if you
have it
as long as you're vaccinated that
changes everything and that was the main
context of the the rest of her point
she said we know the vaccines are safe
and effective
and recently we found out they're even
better than we thought
that's all it was she literally said
nothing except things you'd
you'd want her to say which is we
thought it was safe
now we know it's extra safe and on top
of that we know that vaccinated people
who have it can't give it that's
gigantic
totally
uh but
the way it was taken out of context i
think you're going to see some fake news
that acts like they didn't know it was
safe or something nothing like that is
true
not that anybody could know for sure
anything safe
there's a uh
big news
in the nuclear
energy business so apparently there's
this uh consortium led by
rolls royce
that is building these smaller nuclear
reactors and uh
they call them the small modular
reactors smrs
and they're going to build all these
mini reactors and they found some new
technology to increase their output and
make them even better
so now these factory-built reactors
did you hear that
factory-built reactors
they're going to build
a nuclear power plant
in a factory
and then ship it to the location
do you know how big a deal that is
that's everything
that's everything that's the end of
climate change is a problem
if if they can pull this off
and apparently
it aims to bring 10 mini nuclear
reactors into use by 2035
with the first one coming in around
2030. now of course things get delayed
but if you're building your reactor in a
factory
you're going to be able to at least
build it on time or on time-ish
and i wouldn't think that they would
build it unless they knew that they
could get it approved and had a location
for it so i feel like
this is some of the biggest news in the
world
like
i'll go further
this is some of the biggest news
in human civilization
some of the biggest news
in human civilization
if they can pull this off
yeah paul well portable i think is maybe
uh overstating it but it looks like they
can build it in a factory maybe move you
know one part at a time to where it
needs to be and then assemble it but
if they pull this off
i mean seriously
this would be like the discovery of
electricity it's that big
because it changes climate change it
changes pollution
it would change wars
i mean it would change the balance of
power
it would it would uh allow us to
you know it's probably just you know
that the fact that we're getting this
good at nuclear energy would allow us to
populate space
because you need small nuclear reactors
for space and you need lots of people
who are trained to build them which you
need a domestic
domestic industry to get that now this
is happening over in great britain i
believe yeah in the uk
uh but certainly if they're doing it
over there and they will prove that
these factory-built uh generators work
that could be huge
uh michael smerkanisch over on cnn
uh and i've often told you that on cnn
he's the
i would say one of the two or three
most objective people on that network
and he says there was a survey and a
tweet he said survey on whether donald
trump deserves any thanks for the speed
of the vaccine
now
what do you think
somebody saying that new scale nu scale
is building some reactors in idaho so
the united states is is doing a lot with
small nuclear reactors too
um but do you think
what do you think do you think that
people in the country believe that trump
should get credit for how fast the
vaccines came out
and when i saw that i said to myself
wait a minute are you telling me that
there's anybody who wouldn't give him
credit for that anybody you you could
find
are you serious you can find one person
even one person
in the whole world can you even find me
one person who would say that trump was
not directly
responsible for the speed of vaccines
just find me one person
let's see how the poll went
half of the people say no
i'm sort of rounding but basically
half of the country
says no he doesn't get credit for that
what
and it turns out that the exact numbers
you know it's it's roughly half and half
but the exact numbers line up really
really close to the 2020 election
results
so basically
even the simplest truth
the simplest truth
that trump did make a difference on the
speed of the vaccines the most
unambiguous
simplest truth
reported exactly the same
on every network
like even msnbc i think
correct me if i'm wrong but i think even
msnbc's would say yeah
trump got us vaccines faster don't they
do they even argue with that
how in hell
do half of the country
not know that's true
how in hell and the answer is
they just they voted for their team
that's all that has nothing to do with
any information or
facts or anything it's just people voted
for their team
uh rasmussen poll
polled uh people to find out if uh
people thought that trump or biden had
better policies about
uh israel
what do you think people said do you
think that conservatives thought trump
was better on israel or biden
surprise
conservatives thought trump was better
about israel
but how about
how about liberals
well big surprise
the liberals say that trump was worse
in dealing with israel
now
again
yeah there's always room for
disagreement and it's definitely an
opinion but
i don't feel like this one is close
i don't feel that this was a close call
i'm positive that trump did better with
israel in terms of policy
i don't think there's any question about
that
the abraham accords of course you know
being a big context
for that
uh
it's just amazing that there's a
disagreement on that which is further
proof that we don't use facts or data
so you all remember the story of the ceo
of coca-cola getting a little extra
awoke and going public with his opinions
on the election
and uh
today there's uh the first dilbert
cartoon on dilbert's ceo deciding to get
more political because he thinks it'll
be good for business
maybe it won't be
so you've got a few days of dilbert's
ceo being
say inspired by the ceo of coca-cola
now how many of you know
elon musk's one of his rules for
work
this has been widely reported that elon
musk has a
let's say a philosophy for how
tesla should be managed
and he explicitly says this i'm
paraphrasing but he explicitly says this
that
if you're doing if you have a company
rule
that could show up in a dilbert comic
maybe you shouldn't do it
a very simple rule if you look at the
rule and you say to yourself oh that
could end up in a dilbert comic strip
maybe don't do that rule maybe that's a
rule you should rethink
so that's the the elon musk theory and
the ceo of coca-cola will be
testing out that concept because he did
just become
a character in a dilbert comic
we'll see how that works out for him
all right
that
is pretty much what i want to talk about
just checking my many notes
all right
is there anything i forgot to talk about
today
um
mustafa says we can colonize mars but
your printer won't work when we get
there
yeah
yeah that's probably true
all right anything else i forgot
all right we should
about the teachers unions
let me ask you this
is it my imagination
or have the teachers unions completely
destroyed all their credibility now they
still have tons of power
so maybe that won't change at all
but
i feel as though
the teachers unions were
a lot more popular a year ago
and i've been hammering on him for a
year corey deangelis has been doing an
amazing job hammering on the teachers
unions trying to get
school choice a little bit more accepted
and
i feel as if there's been a big change
now i've been trying for a long time to
paint the teachers unions as the primary
source
of systemic racism because they are if
you fixed education
everything else would go better
right there'd still be racism you can't
eliminate that sort of thing totally
but if everybody got a fair shot at an
education which they don't have now
i feel like the problem of systemic
racism would get a lot less
even though it would never go to zero
so
i'm getting lots of
suggestions here for
how to destroy my printer i like the
trebuchet
yeah
i might have to build a tray mache just
to see how far i can did i pronounce
that right
uh to see how far i can toss my printer
all right let's see
my senses the teachers unions are still
big but now very brittle
yeah i think so
i i feel as if
we're getting close to the breaking
point
now apparently there is more of a
waiting list for classic uh charter
schools
than
there are spaces
so there's that didn't make sense but
there's a waiting list for charter
schools and as long as there is that
pressure is going to continue and i
think there are a lot more
a lot more prominent people willing to
take on the teachers unions
you know have i told you that
the the government gets to be in charge
until they just can't do their job
and then the citizens
are
in charge
now that's not written in the
constitution right
and nowhere in the constitution does it
say does it say if you're uh if your
leaders are incompetent you can just
take over and just make the decisions
for them doesn't say that
but it's true
sometimes there's just for whatever
reason
our leaders just can't leave
for example in the coronavirus
leaders can't lead the way we want them
to
because leaders have to focus on safety
over lifestyle
makes sense you don't want them to
change that but it requires that toward
the end of the pandemic that the
citizens take control and i'll tell you
i in my town it looks like it's already
happening i mean the masks were pretty
much off yesterday
it's a lot of you want to see my printer
be destroyed i'm just watching the the
comments go by anyway my point is on
with the teachers unions uh neither the
republicans nor the democrats can go as
hard against them as they'd like because
the teachers unions are too strong so
they could they could fund you to be
removed from office if you go against
them so politicians are the wrong tool
for fixing school choice
because they're too weak compared to the
teachers unions
but
i don't have that problem
the teachers unions can't hurt me
i mean they could try but what are they
going to do the teachers unions can't
hurt corey deangelis
the teachers unions can't hurt any blue
czech person who retweets anything they
hear eyes say about the teachers unions
and so i would say
that this is yet yet again another case
where by design you know what it is that
it means to be a leader in america and
how you get your money and how you get
reelected
by design our political leaders can't
help us on this
it's sort of going to have to come from
the the parents and the public
so i think the public has just got to
take control of this decision yeah at
some point there's going to be enough
public force
that the politicians will just have to
cave
so we have to be more powerful than the
teachers unions or the teachers unions
get everything they want
so
what does social media give you
how many times have i told you
that our current form of government is
no longer a republic
this is real
we're not a republican anymore
we are something closer to an influencer
based
democracy
meaning that we let the public we let
the leaders you know pick up the garbage
and you know make sure we have the
military and do the basic stuff right
but the moment our leaders
can't do a decision they're just the
wrong tool for the job
as they are with coronavirus once it
gets to the end of it anyway
the public just takes over
and when i say the public takes over
there are usually some influencers
some handful of influencers who have
enough influence
that pretty soon they they start moving
the numbers if you look at the uh school
choice
preference polling
you look at it today compared to a year
ago
pretty big move
right there's way more interest in
in school choice than it was even one
year ago where did that come from
none of it came from our leaders
correct me if i'm wrong
but name the leader who's always talking
about school choice
um
who now i know that
republicans talk about it all the time
but it's usually just in a list
like there's no leader you can say oh
there's that's the that's the school
choice person
you know in the way that you could say
aoc is sort of a climate change
you know leader
like it or not i mean she's associated
with it
but who is who is the leader
who's going against the teachers unions
they just talk about it trump talks
about it a little bit
he doesn't really try too hard right
um yeah so so my point is that the
public does run the country at this
point
via influencers via social media which
eventually will push the news business
which will eventually push the
politicians
but for these complicated ones it's the
public the public is already in charge
you used to be betsy devos yeah but
bessie devos
when you have that job
you just don't get much attention if
you're if you're in the cabinet
yeah all the republicans talk about it
but it's not like a big theme you know
it's not like climate change or anything
you should be but it's not
uh did you hear the story there was just
a massive amount of fentanyl that got
captured at the border border
massive amount
now you know that that mostly comes from
china
so now we know that china is killing us
with fentanyl intentionally
and we know that the coronavirus came
from the wuhan lab
we don't know the details of that but
would it be fair to say that we are
already losing a chemical and biological
war to china
so china is polluting our atmosphere
which will cause us to spend massively
on climate change because they're
polluting it
sending us fentanyl
and coronavirus
it's basically full-scale world war
three chemical warfare chemical
biological warfare
we're in it i mean we're in the middle
of a gigantic war
that just took half a million casualties
this year but we just act like it's
something else
so
um i'm not on the side that says that
china released any kind of virus
intentionally i think that would be
crazy
like you know even if you could imagine
they had some kind of a way they could
come out ahead by doing it
i just don't see any leader doing that
just don't see it
the the that would be fair to say tell
me uh is are you saying paul that uh
that i'm going into too much hyperbole
um
that's how the big lie works bro
what is how the big lie works
how many of you believe
the big lie
meaning that uh it's proven that the
election was fair and untainted
and that anybody who suggests is not is
part of the big lie
how many of you watching this video
uh buy into the notion that that's the
big lie
how many of you
because that's pure um
brainwashing
if you buy into that phrase the big lie
you you've bought into
one of the most blatant
pure brainwashing
persuasion plays of all time
because you can't really know what
happened
in the thing you didn't look for or you
haven't looked for completely you can't
know something isn't there if you didn't
look
so the certainty with which the
big lie
is branded as you know we know this to
be true that it's a lie
it's amazing it's amazing that uh that
that's even legal
let me go further
it shouldn't be legal to use the phrase
the big lie
shouldn't be legal
because it does make a claim
that's not true
and that not true claim that we know for
sure what the result was either fair or
unfair
my take is that we couldn't know it's
unknowable given that nobody was looking
for it and it wasn't transparent
so
it feels like you should be illegal to
just blatantly do fake news like that
uh the great thing about education is
the teachers unions are being hollowed
out by local individual decisions
that's right there will be enough people
who are going to home homeschool
that two things are going to happen one
it's going to make it more obvious that
the schools need to compete or fail
and number two the homeschooling if you
get more and more people homeschooling
than the the technology and the systems
which do homeschooling will just get
better and apparently they're really
good now so they'll just keep getting
better
all right
yes teachers are good and
unions
teachers unions are bad
not unions are bad but teachers unions
are bad
um somebody says the big lie is abide in
one
that's no more smart
you know it
if you're gonna say that we know for
sure
either way
that's just that's just not where the
smart people should be the smartest the
smart people here's the smartest opinion
because it's mine
defenestrate the printer
maybe i will the smartest opinion on the
election uh
credibility is that we can't know
because we haven't looked for it
um so we don't know if it was fair or
not fair it's unknowable
but we do know that the system has
installed the president so the system
did what the system did
so i'd say that the
system gave us a president and that's
fine
somebody says scott's ego is taking over
well
you get banned for that
now what will i do shall i just uh i'll
hide i'll just hide you
so you don't exist anymore
um
keep in mind that all criticism is
welcome
but you have to give a reason
scott's ego
is taking over is not a reason
and if there's somebody here who
operates without their ego
please let me know because i would like
to meet such an amazing person
uh
all right uh oligarchs do work i don't
know what that means
uh
logic arguments please
yes yes please all right that's all i
got for now i'm just babbling and i will
talk to you tomorrow
