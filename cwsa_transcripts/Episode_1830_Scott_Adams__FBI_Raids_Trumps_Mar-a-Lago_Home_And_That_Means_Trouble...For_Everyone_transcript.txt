good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization
was there any news yesterday
yes there was there was and you came to
the right place because everybody else
is talking about it
all wrong
but we're going to do it right
and all you need to enjoy this
experience
is a copper mug or a glass of tanker
jealous either canteen jug or flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope being hit of the day
the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
ahead tastes like freedom
let's keep that alive
well we'll get to the big story of
course but i just had to
make this
announcement um that i'm going to start
blocking anybody who tries to vaxplain
to me
here's what you get blocked for
scott
don't you know
that the vaccinations
that you call shots are not really
vaccinations
because they don't prevent you from
getting it
blocked
you're right
but how many times do you have to tell
me what everybody knows
if you just tell me the same thing
everybody knows
do you assume i'm the last person in the
world to find out that the vaccinations
so called
don't actually block transmission no no
i actually know it
and every time you mention it again i'm
gonna block you
please don't do it just please stop
saying it it's the soylent green of
of the pandemic
all right well uh i don't know if you
heard but uh trump's mar-a-lago home got
raided by the fbi
don't call it a raid the democrats say
it's no raid
it's just people showing up unexpectedly
at 4am with guns and asking for access
to your house
but not a raid no no no it's serving
wart
the democrats would have you believe
that there's nothing raid like about
that whatsoever just the legal process
working exactly the way it's supposed to
uh my take is that uh trump just won the
black vote for 2024
because every time he seems unfairly
targeted by law enforcement
i feel like there's a little
a little bell that rings inside the head
of everybody who feels like
maybe they have also been unfairly
targeted by law enforcement
if you're going to bond over something
bonding over being unfairly treated by
law enforcement
is a real good way to go
the best part about this
is that trump backed prison reform
trump worked hard and sacrificed quite a
bit of his political capital i would
argue
to get a lot of black people out of jail
sooner than they would have
now it wasn't just for black people of
course but
since they're disproportionately
affected by the justice system
so here is trump
who
to his credit i would say because i was
in favor of it
um did a great deal to reduce the amount
of jail time that black people were
experiencing in the united states
and now he has
it looks like
we don't know what the justification is
yet
we may be surprised maybe they have
something
maybe this time the walls really are
closing in on trump
maybe it's really worse than watergate
for the first time
maybe
maybe anything's possible
but i think if you look at it it kind of
looks like they don't have anything
because i feel like we would have heard
about it
if it were anything big
but
yeah so
certainly the voters are going to have
some reaction to this but there's more
there's more to learn
because i think our our opinion won't be
finalized until we find out what the
warrant is about
um
does it feel to you that
let me just tell you how it feels
so the next is is just literally just
how it feels so there's no factual basis
to the next thing i'm going to say
it feels like the fbi is protecting
itself from trump
am i wrong
it feels like they're protecting
themselves it doesn't feel like this was
for the country
because i can't think of anything that i
felt threatened by
by knowing that the president who has
full clearance
for
for any kind of information an
ex-president has complete
security clearance if somebody with
complete security clearance has some
documents
that probably we have copies of
let me ask you this
how many documents make it into the
white house
that are not digitally recorded before
they're handed to the president
do they only record it after the
president touches it
and then what happens to it when he's
done he sets it on the desk or whatever
does somebody just say well there's a
document we don't have to do anything
with
or do they just scan everything
don't you assume it's all
it all exists in a scanned form
what kind of documents exactly is he
taking home
from the white house
that are not recorded in some form in
another place
i guess i have some questions about the
process
well to me it looks like the fbi is
trying to
avoid trump looking into their own
behavior that's what it feels like i
have no
no proof of that can't read any minds
but it feels like it as a as a citizen
of the united states it's just how it
makes me feel
it makes me more likely to want to vote
and i don't vote
right that's a long story you know why
but
this makes even me want to vote
and that's a pretty high bar
but again we're reacting on
incomplete information
now
what the democrats are trying to sell us
and even uh
david axelrod
uh came at us with this
so this is a david axelrod tweet and
because it came from him
it means a little bit more i'll tell you
why
he tweeted one thing is very clear
garland the attorney general garland
would not have authorized this raid and
no federal judge would have signed off
on it if there weren't significant
evidence to warrant it
to which i say
what
what kind of a country do we live in
that anybody would even
say this in public
have we not proven beyond a shadow of a
doubt that the fbi would in fact
falsify information
uh
to the court
we don't have to wonder if that's true
somebody's going to jail for her right
or is plead guilty to it we have a
guilty plea
that this exact behavior
faking a you know reason for action
and in the same domain it's not even a
different domain it's trump
so we know that they will falsify
information to make trump look bad the
very organization
oh let's say the department of justice
plus the fbi i'm gonna i'm gonna lump
them together for this conversation
but here's what's interesting
in my opinion axelrod is one of the
democrats who's least likely
to directly lie to you
now of course he's you know on team
democrat solidly so he's going to give
you the the democrat spin on everything
but i can't think of a time when he's
lied directly
he's one of the higher credibility
democrats
who you know sells his point of view and
you know it's a point of view
do you have do you have evidence of
something he did that was
as bad as this tweet
and and so he's he's sort of like an
indicator for me
there's some people on the political
left
who have more credibility than others
and i think he has more credibility than
most of the people on the left because
he's more transparent about being on a
team and he says things that don't sound
that crazy
so to me that's pretty credible yeah
fully transparent i'm on this team
here's here's my opinion okay i get that
but this seems to be a departure
from what i
have noticed of his pattern now that's
only based on what i've noticed so
there's a gap in that
but it feels like
he's completely bought off on
um
selling this
perspective that's clearly ridiculous
this is the first time i've seen him try
to sell a perspective that's obviously
and clearly ridiculous
now if you're going to respond to
something that's obviously and clearly
ridiculous
what is the persuasion method
most effective
what would be the the persuasion
technique which i've taught you many
times by different
well mocking mocking is good
but i think mocking has lost a lot of
its
importance
mocking in the political
field doesn't really work
mocking in the corporate world works
really well
let me make that distinction that's
important
mockery
is brutally effective in the corporate
world
brutally effective
nobody wants to get mocked in the
corporate world
in politics it's just the it's the
atmosphere
i mean mocking each other is literally
all that's going on
there's nothing but it so it doesn't
really have any power in politics
so i would say that responding to a
ridiculous point of view
with mockery
just doesn't work in politics it's fun
i do it all the time
it could be entertaining for your base
but there's no persuasion element to it
uh
agree and amplify
no no there's a there's a cleaner way
it's called the
the high ground
so here's my response to
the david axelrod tweet he got he got
tens of thousands of responses so he's
not going to see mine
but
here's uh
here's the high ground approach so when
he says
there must be significant evidence to
validate the warrant
i say this
i said this point by david axelrod might
have been valid 10 years ago
today anyone not zombified by fake news
assumes an fbi raid on a republican is
probably illegitimate
because the pattern is hard to miss
that's the high ground the high ground
is well you're absolutely right
10 years ago
if i just said everything you're saying
is ridiculous
that just sounds like somebody
disagreeing just to disagree but if you
say your point of view was absolutely
valid
10 years ago
but it ignores our recent history in
which the fbi has shown that they can't
be trusted on exactly this question
of do you have a good reason to act
this exact question has been you know
proven to us
publicly and without any doubt
this is something we have to worry about
and so the fact that david axelrod would
live through the last several years
and would say
without any hedging
that if the fbi is acting on a warrant
there must be good significant evidence
for it
and everything suggests that that's just
not true
now if i just said well you're full of
 and you're lying
that has no effect but if you say
yeah you were right 10 years ago that's
the way it used to be
you've really
you've really accepted the point of view
but you've infantilized them at the same
time
so that that's basically what i did with
with his point of view i i infantilized
it i basically said well
you know
you were right as far as you went
but the adults can go a little bit
further
right
the children can say yes
warrants need good reasons that's a
child's point of view an adult's point
of view is well not lately
you know lately the pattern has been
very clear and established by the courts
or at least a legal system because we do
have somebody admitting to it right
there's a confession
so that's pretty clear
all right so we're going to find out
today
how many americans have not heard
of the
russia collusion hoax
there are actually people who don't know
that the russia collusion thing was a
hoax
and they're weighing in on social media
they literally don't know that that was
a hoax they actually think and they
believe that because
what's his name manafort
the democrats that believe that because
manafort
is known to have shared some internal
polling information with one russian
for money i guess
therefore russia collusion was proved
now
has anybody asked the question
how much national security value
was internal polling information
how in the world was that valuable
internal polling information
really
what was in that internal polling
information wouldn't you like to know
what what do you suppose manafort told a
russian that was useful
that actually the russians said ah
it's a good thing i know that from your
internal polling
i can't even imagine
anything that would have been useful
can you
like what would be an example
give me any example even just make one
up speculate
speculate what what could be possibly an
internal polling information
that would make a difference to
international
i don't know security or anything
nothing
that the best case scenario is it might
have been a heads up
about you know maybe who's going to win
or something i don't know
something like that
but even that would be sketchy i mean
internal polling is not exactly the most
reliable stuff
alright
so nobody's going to ask the question
what did manafort actually share
because if i were manafort i would have
done the following
i would have found something i could
give to this russian who would pay me
money or
return a favor or something later
but i'd make sure it didn't hurt the
country
because i'm pretty sure manafort didn't
want to hurt america he just wanted to
make a buck
i assume
because he wasn't really trying very
hard to hurt america i didn't see any
evidence of that just trying to make a
buck
and
i'd love to know what he thought was
useful to them but also not harmful to
america because that's probably what he
gave him
just speculated
all right
um
so
god there's so much going on about this
one story
uh
so jerry nadler when
he he retweeted a
new york times headline that said
trump's mar-a-lago had been raided
and jerry nadler responded with one word
good
exclamation mark
now i understand
that you know he's a politically on a
different side
doesn't that feel too far
it feels too far doesn't it because as
far as i know there's not even an
alleged crime not even an alleged crime
that
would go to this level in other words if
it's really just some documents
you would not expect a raid
so what is he saying good to
what part is good the fact that america
doesn't know why the fbi which has no
credibility just raided a political
enemy of the current administration
how in the world is this good
in what world can you say in public that
this is good
even if you thought trump
had been guilty of a crime
is this good
and so i would like to
i'd like to put a stake in the ground
when jerry nadler dies of natural causes
which i'm guessing could be within the
week i mean if you just take a look at
him he looks like he's going to go any
minute
but when jerry nedler dies i'm assuming
i'm going to outlive him
i don't know maybe not but i'm going to
make that assumption i'm going to
outlive him
i'm just going to tweet one word
good with exclamation good
because i think he's proven that he's
he's not
he's really not on team america here
whatever team he's on it's not my
country because in my country
if biden's home got raided
and and i didn't have an alleged crime
that i was even aware of
i would say that
i don't care what team biden's on
if you send the fbi to raid him and you
don't tell me why
just you know i i hate to do this but
sometimes you have to just imagine the
reverse
imagine trump in office
and having him investigate biden but
let's say there was no
biden laptop there was nothing like that
there was no actual specific crime
imagine that
would you be in favor of that
hell no
hell no
if trump had done this to biden with
you know equally sketchy reasons let's
say biden had some
documents that were you know in question
let's say it's the same situation
hell no
hell no i would not support trump doing
that or the trump administration doing
that no no no
now i suppose it's easy for me to say
that
because i'm not in that situation but i
i feel like i know myself well enough
that there's no situation in which i'd
be okay with this
because it's the ex-president thing
right
even if i thought biden had done
something sketchy i still wouldn't be in
favor of it
because that whole don't don't go after
don't go after your political enemies
that's a tradition that we kind of need
to keep
right kind of need to keep that one and
i get the whole argument of well
it really depends how bad
the accusation is that's in the warmth
that we haven't seen yet
well
okay
if it turns out that there was a hostage
situation
at mar-a-lago and the hostage was in
some kind of a container with limited
air
and the oxygen was running out and there
was no time to delay
well yeah
execute the warrant even if you're not
quite sure
sure
sure
but
are we going to find out that whatever
the reason that's listed on the warrant
is that going to sound to you
like
a hostage running out of oxygen
do you think you're going to feel the
urgency when you find out what this is
i feel like the urgency might be missing
because these documents have been there
a long time
now here's the other funny part about it
for the democrats point of view to be
valid you would have to accept the
following and by the way this is a
really good
persuasion tip
and the tip goes into the category in
order to believe x
you must also believe
these following things because they're
necessary to support your belief
all right
so in order to believe that there's some
something incriminating in the documents
here's what you'd have to believe
that trump took incriminating documents
that everybody would expect to be
incriminating because you know he took
them he would store them where lots of
people knew where they were because
obviously people at mar-a-lago would
know where they were stored
and that he would
have
them stored in a building that's full of
and i don't know if you know this but
mar-a-lago
was built in the era in which they have
toilets
there are toilets all over that place
i'm pretty sure that trump has a toilet
probably the guests have at least one to
share
now they probably have their own toilets
i'll bet you i'll bet you that place is
just
filled with toilets
so here you have your incriminating
information on pieces of paper
sitting in a building
with a guy
with the democrats say
would never want anybody to see what's
in those documents
and then they're sitting next to
probably 25 toilets
and we have evidence photographic
evidence that trump has allegedly
torn up documents and put them in a
toilet because we actually saw the
photos of actual documents in a toilet
now do you think
that trump could have put all these
things together
and said
documents that would be
highly incriminating to me
but i've got possession of them
i'll store them here next to my 25
toilets
if only there were a way to get rid of
the incriminating information if only i
could come up with some way
so that that's the democrat point of
view
the democrat point of view is number one
the fbi
would never
would never raid somebody
on a warrant unless they had really good
good evidence
ridiculous
ridiculous in 2022 that's ridiculous of
course they would
because there's nothing they wouldn't do
based on their recent history
once you understand the russia collusion
hoax
once you understand what they did
that's known
that part is known
we're not guessing
once you understand that
all bets are off
because what exactly was worse than
trying to depose or change the course of
american history by making up a crime
there's nothing worse than that
there's nothing worse than that
whatever this is
is not worse than that
it's just bad
not worse than that
all right um
so
i'm just going to throw this story in
the middle and we'll get back to it
so israel and gaza have reached a
ceasefire
and i would like to congratulate both
israel and gaza for getting everything
that they wanted
and of this uh recent flare-up
and i say that because
the government of israel kind of needs
to have an active
enemy
every time somebody attacks israel
israel gets stronger
you know they take a little more land
they you know have to take a high ground
to defend themselves maybe keep it you
know what i mean
so israel sort of needs a permanent
enemy but the best case
scenario is that it's a low-grade
conflict
and they need it to flare up now and
then to remind you
and then they needed to go back down
likewise the uh the folks in gaza who
are who are firing the missiles and
stuff they also need a flare-up of
violence every now and then because
that's how they get more funding
from their sponsors
and so this was just theater you know
nobody in gaza thought they were going
to conquer israel
am i right
nobody in gaza thought they were going
to conquer israel
but here's the other question
do you think israel couldn't completely
stop this from happening if they wanted
to
of course they could but it would be it
would require far more brutality than
they could handle right reputationally
so the very best situation is that this
this type of attack flares up
it killed 43 people this time
including 15 children
i don't know on which side it doesn't
mention whose side they were on but from
israel's point of view that was an
acceptable loss
especially since it's not all on their
side
and from the the gazan's point of view i
think it was an acceptable loss
because they got everything they needed
out of it
i'm not even sure this needs to be news
anymore
like it's a weird kind of news where
it's just two sides getting exactly what
they want and then going back to the
status quo to wait until the next
flare-up
it's just theater
i wouldn't even bother trying to fix
that
so
how angry are you about the mar-a-lago
raid
tell me your uh
tell me your feeling
did it did it immediately make you
want to go all january 6 on this
situation
so here's the thing
i'm going to warn you about
don't overreact
don't overreact
because you know there's some militia
right now that
that just got their marching orders
right
somewhere there's a right-leaning
militia
that trump will get tagged with even
though he doesn't even know the names
probably
and they're firing up right now and
they're going to use this as their
justification for marching or whatever
now i don't think they're going to start
shooting
i think they're just going to make
another show of you know a show of here
we are
and then the democrats will run
run that and they'll say not only
is trump obviously a president a
criminal they will say
because look at this warrant
which we have no details about well
clearly it must be a valid warrant
because nobody would do an invalid
warrant just because they have done it
recently
in right in front of us nobody would do
that
right
so
it looks like a setup
it feels like a setup
so i would worry that the democrats at
least part of the strategy would be to
provoke an overreaction
because remember the january sixth thing
completely fell apart
they were trying to show that the
republicans are a bunch of you know
armed dangerous insurrectionists and the
entire january 6 they just dissolved in
sunlight
in fact the harvard uh
the harvard sponsored
survey
showed that the vast majority of the
people attended thought they were saving
the republic
they didn't think it was an insurrection
they thought they were saving it from an
insurrection that's all of evidence now
now we know what the crowd thought
they were not there for an insurrection
most of them some of them were but you
know any big crowd is going to have
some some minority opinion in it
uh
and then we saw the evidence and the
evidence didn't seem damning of trump at
all
you know at least in a criminal sense
uh
and now coincidentally we get this
imagine what would happen if all the the
militias show up
and they start looking dangerous again
don't get suckered into this you know
if if you know anybody in the militia
i'm sure there's somebody in the militia
who's watching this there's got to be at
least one
be a little more strategic
whatever whatever your militia
you know long-term objectives are i'm
not saying they're good i'm not saying
they're bad i don't know i have no idea
what they are probably lots of different
different ones
but just be cool for a little bit
just be cool for a little bit because
you don't want to make a big show that's
exactly what they want
so
um just wait
now
what do you think they're actually going
to come up with as their explanation for
the warrant
and and by the way do we ever find out
how does the process work
because at some point
trump himself has to find out what it's
about right
is that not part of the prop
process
the person who's targeted
has to hear what the charge is
am i wrong
uh the warrant should say
and when the warrant is served somebody
reads it right on the receiving end so
are you
okay now i have a big question are you
telling me that somebody at mar-a-lago
got a search warrant and read it
and it said why they were there
and we don't know that yet
really
there's somebody at mar-a-lago who
actually read the warrant
because they had to let him in right
it's a sealed warrant somebody says
it would be initially sealed
so you're telling me that the fbi can
come to your house i guess you are
telling me this and they can say
i have a secret document you can't see
that says i can search your house
and you're not even accused of a crime
that's actually the process seriously
seriously
i'm not going to take that as a fact
i feel like there must be some nuance on
that there's enough people saying no
uh a no knock warrant
yeah they did have no knock warrants so
that would suggest that it was legal at
one point
but that but the no knock bar had more
to do with avoiding violence that's sort
of a different situation
the warrant has to be served
but how can it be sealed and served
does that mean
are you telling me that the target of
the warrant is not told why they're
searching
literally
the indictment is sealed not the warrant
okay that makes more sense i feel like
we're all bad lawyers trying to figure
this out
if anybody here is actually
an attorney
could you put that in your comment you
know like
i'm a lawyer comma
here here's what's true
that would help a lot
because the rest of us are just guessing
they don't have to show you the details
until later
so apparently so somebody's saying they
can say we're here for these documents
for example
but they don't have to say because the
documents might say x y or z
yeah well let's let's watch uh
barnes and
and fry talk about this they'll be
better
the warrant oh the lawyer says the
warrant describes the premises to be
searched okay thank you so from an
actual lawyer the warrant describes the
premise
it doesn't describe the
crime or alleged crime
now i guess i guess you could have a
warrant to search somebody who's not
accused of a crime
correct
because you could be searching a
confederate's house or a family member's
house so you don't have to be accused of
a crime to be served a warrant
okay so that does suggest that the
person whose home is being searched
doesn't have to know the topic
they just have to know that the warrant
describes
what will be searched
that sounds right
i'm going to act like that's right
because it sounds right
um
they search for evidence so they can
accuse you of crime rights but they have
to have some reason to suspect there's
something there
where was melania i don't know that's a
good question yeah was melania with
trump why didn't they report that
now as jack posabic reminds us on
twitter
the the big risk here is if
trump
is i don't know if indicted is enough
but if he's found guilty
of doing some kind of a document
destruction and crime he would be
ineligible to hold office
and it looks like that might be the play
but they don't have to get that exactly
they can just smear him you know until
election day
all right
um
where were the security people
yeah now
the security people presumably
looked at the warrant or
listened to somebody who looked at the
warrant
and decided that they would step aside
but it does make you wonder what their
job description is
all right um
this is going to drag out for years
so do you think that the real play is
just to
put trump in legal jeopardy
at the same time he's trying to run for
reelection
is it called reelection if you
if there's a term in between yours
yeah it's creating some friction exactly
well
does it seem to you
that this would backfire
if you were a democrat would you think
that
indicting trump would
make people less likely to vote for you
i i don't think so
i i think that republicans would be more
likely
because remember republicans just
watched the whole january 6th thing play
out and two republicans it looked like
people who look like them
and think like them were being rounded
up and jailed
and now the leader of the people who
look like them and think like them
looks like he's being targeted they
would say unfairly
i feel like
i feel like this would
vastly
increase the number of
people who voted
so here's here's my hypothesis
there there are two possibilities
i think that is suggested by this whole
situation one and they're opposites
which is interesting
one possibility is that they really do
have something on trump and is good
i mean from their point of view from the
the jerry nadler point of view would be
good
right
so that's one possibility they they have
the goods
but they need these documents to really
you know seal the deal
that's one possibility
the other possibility is desperation
the other possibility is that they know
they don't have anything and nobody has
anything that all of the various
walls are closing in
theories have all turned to dust
and they watch the january sixth thing
turn to complete crap right in front of
them
it could be
that they're so afraid of trump getting
the power to
to hire a special special prosecutor
that they can't take the chance because
once the trump administration gets in
there one assumes
they're going to look into the biden's
association with ukraine
um
and they're going to be looking at a lot
of stuff that maybe wasn't being looked
at you know the hunter laptop and stuff
and so i've got a feeling that this is a
desperate attempt
to try to keep the bidens on the jail
and people associated with them
it looks to me
like desperation
because under the theory under the
scenario that they really have something
real and that just finding
finding something at mar-a-lago would be
the final thing
what are the odds of that
i mean as i talked about before what are
the odds that trump would keep something
incriminating
on a piece of paper
i don't know if i've mentioned but paper
is easy to destroy
you could flush it
yeah you can flush it
yeah so it seems deeply unlikely that
there's something in there that's
incriminating
it's more likely that he wanted to keep
some things
maybe embarrassing
but that's not a crime
um
i i'm going to tell the
locals people
some some stuff after i turn off youtube
in a little bit
i give them the behind the curtain stuff
that i can't say in in a more public way
so there is something fun about this
story that nobody's mentioned yet so
i'll mention that just the locals people
later so stay tuned for that
all right um
so those are your two possibilities
which one seems more likely
is this does it seem likely
that the democrats would have some kind
of allegation
that so strong that trump would be in
actual legal danger and yet that
allegation would be so strong
that they need these documents that are
in mar-a-lago
to make the case
do you think that's likely
do you think it's likely that something
in his possession
would make their case i feel like that's
the least likely thing in the world
i mean it just feels ridiculously
unlikely possible
possible
but ridiculously unlikely
all right so to me it looks political
so it looks political based on the
history of the fbi
the fact that there's no uh there was no
larger allegation
that this is obviously tied to
the timing of it
and and the way it was done
every single thing about this is screams
fraud
and corruption
every part of it
now here's the thing
if you're a citizen of the united states
and you're accused of something what is
the standard to which we hold you
everybody
what is the standard when somebody who
is an american citizen is accused of a
crime
the standard is
innocent
until proven guilty
and we all agree with that right
like that's one thing that every
american is going to say yeah okay we
can we can disagree a lot
but innocent until proven guilty
that's a bottom line
that is a bottom line american principle
you you don't you don't play with that
one
right
now that's how we treat citizens
how do we treat government organizations
remember an organization is not a person
organizations don't have constitutional
rights people do
so what should be your guiding
assumption
about the guilt of the fbi
in this case
you should be guilty
your starting assumption should be
guilty
and you can be forgiven for that
you can be forgiven
now if the fbi had a spotless record up
to this point
they still need to make their
their argument
they still got to make a good case and
they haven't done that
i mean maybe they will
anything could happen
but you have to assume that the fbi is
guilty unless they prove otherwise
so your
your best
citizen
positive
protect the republic point of view is
that the fbi is corrupt
in this specific case
that's the best thing you could assume
as a citizen
it's the thing that protects the system
the best
if you want to protect the american
system
you should start with a solid assumption
that the fbi is corrupt
in this case in particular
based on pattern and history
they need to prove the out of that
if they want to change my mind do you
know how hard it's going to be to change
my mind that this was anything but a a
political
thing very hard
they're going to have to prove it beyond
a reasonable doubt
and they're going to have to try hard
and if we if we don't hold them to that
standard
i'm not sure we should
expect that our standard will be held to
either the innocent until proven guilty
the thing you like
i don't know if that can hold up either
if you let the fbi get away with
innocent until proven guilty when it's
obvious they don't play that way
they play guilty
we know that that's not a question
so
uh the best
wisest
most practical
most useful starting point of view
is that the fbi is guilty in this case
and they better prove otherwise and i'll
wait
so
um i think
you know i tweeted yesterday i'll give
my government 48 hours
because i think 48 hours is enough that
the fog of war situation will calm down
a little bit
and then after 48 hours people said well
what then cartoon boy
what are you gonna do
make a
make a
witty cartoon about it
no i'm not threatening
i'm saying that after 48 hours i'll form
an opinion
does that sound radical
that i'm going to wait until i
know enough about this situation
to form an opinion
i didn't tell you what the opinion is
going to be
if i told you what
if i told you it was a threat
as in you know if this happens i'll do
something i don't know what
it's not a threat
i'm just telling you what's the minimum
i need to form an opinion
i need some information you know beyond
the fog of war i need some actual useful
information
so when i get that i'm going to form an
opinion but i'm definitely not going to
form one yet
at this point we have questions
we have speculation
we have a complete lack of trust
in our institutions but that's earned
so we don't need to change that
erica says you sit on the fence
do i erica
am i sitting on the fence
or am i
waiting to find out
what's actually happening
i'm not sure that's the same
because one of them is uh um
erica
all right here here i'm talking to the
fake erica
you know there's apparently there's more
than one erika in the
in this situation here so we we've got
one erika on the locals platform but
we're not talking about that erica
we're talking about all capital letters
erica over here on youtube
dark erika
you know if you're at the
the democrats are calling biden dark
brandon
they're trying to take advantage of the
negative labeling it's not working
all right um
do i think the queens of drilling dark
dry holes finally hit oil probably not
um
all right
giving the benefit of
did i just do that did i just give the
fbi the benefit of a doubt
while saying they couldn't be trusted
that's what somebody on youtube says
no
i'm not giving anybody the benefit of a
doubt
i'm saying that i'll know more tomorrow
how is that even
provocative
the the most reasonable opinion in the
world is huh
maybe i'll wait and hear what this
warrants all about before i make an
opinion
because what if they come up with their
you know there was a hostage or some
damn thing anything can happen
and remember
there's a chance
that this is all a trick
right
one possibility
is that trump you know knew there was
nothing there but he baited them into
raiding him to get these documents
maybe
yeah he may have tricked them into
thinking there was something there that
they needed so that there would be a
raid
which would be amazingly clever
but you know i don't assume that's true
i i think that would be a little too
clever
but you can't rule it out
we're at the point where nothing can be
ruled out at this point
uh yeah i don't think it's 3d chess but
can't rule it out
i i agree with what you're saying
um somebody at locals was saying it's so
hard to
be friends with a democrat now
it really is
it really is
the only way you can do it is if they
don't follow politics if they follow
politics you just can't even hang out
with them
scott's waking up
now
now i did learn
that at least one person when they say
scott's waking up
uh is
just joking
so i'm gonna treat it like it's just
joking when you say that because i don't
know the difference
you've lost friends since listening to
my
my podcast
how many of you have lost friends
because of something i've said
that's probably
oh my god
because of something i said
oh
well turns out i've cost a lot of people
their friends
you're all saying yes are you serious
somebody said check the market
what is the stock market doing
nothing
why'd you say check the market there's
not really anything happening
oh your friends are tired of you quoting
me
does anybody else have that problem
oh my god
apparently i've cost a lot of you a lot
of friends
oh my god this is horrifying
my wife doesn't like hearing you
do any of you how many of you have a
spouse
or a significant other
who uh
can't stand your habit of listening to
me
does anybody have a spouse who's going
crazy
all right
can you um do me a favor if you have a
spouse
who hates you listening to me
could you just turn up the sound right
now
because i have a message for your spouse
i'll give you give you a second
everybody
could you just turn up your
volume really loud
if your spouse is around i want to talk
to your spouse for a second all right i
think that's long enough you ready
hey spouse you should totally be
listening
to these live streams
because you would learn so much
your spouse is the smart one
you should be possibly doing more things
for him or her
because the smart one is watching my
live stream
now you've been warned
if you're watching the other news you're
deeply uninformed
join your spouse
join your spouse
you can turn down the volume now
i feel like
i feel like we came together a little
bit there
did you feel it
ah yeah it was like the world was
divided and then i feel like we brought
them together
bonding exactly
ann says no sex for a month for her
so
anne's available
[Laughter]
that's too funny
if there's anybody else not getting sex
from their spouse
you might want to call it out here
because there's plenty of people who are
willing to fill in
yeah
i'm just talking about transitory
sex i'm not talking about the permanent
kind of a sex partner
i just mean to get you past the live
stream and through the political
period more of a transitory cheating
so
so you got that to look forward to
oh my
i had
i've taught all of you how to lose your
friends
oh that's
that's more than true
all right all right well let me ask on
the positive side how many of you
have bonded with your spouse or
significant other or even a family
member
over my live stream
is there anybody here who listens to it
with their mom
for example
i know i know some of you do
some of you listen to it with your mom
all right okay good
see i'm bringing people together
i'm bringing families together i'm not
just ripping people apart
i'm bringing them together
all right good
so um let me ask you this how many of
you came into this live stream
uh on fire
because of the raid on mar-a-lago
and i talked you down a little bit do
you feel more relaxed
just wait and see
because first of all if what you want is
a trump presidency
i think he got closer
right
if this follows the pattern of every
other thing we've seen
the pattern would be they they're over
claiming
they don't have evidence of any kinds of
crimes they're going to act like they do
and then the republicans are going to
get really really mad that they have
been hunted
by the way have i ever made a better
prediction than the one i most mocked
for
that republicans would get hunted
huh
uh your dog does anybody have a pet who
likes to listen to me in the morning
anybody does anybody have a pet
dog or a cat
yes dogs mostly right
yeah because i don't really speak to the
cats
i i try to do uh content that leans
human canine
and a little bit less
less a cat
cats won't listen well you need new cats
you lost your pet friends oh you're
somebody lost their pet friends
because of listening to that's that's
bad i'm sorry
the pets couldn't handle you anymore huh
was it because you're recording me too
much
has anybody ever quoted me
i've got a feeling that happens
sometimes
you know i was
before i did any public stuff
here's a little uh weird little anecdote
since i have a minute here
uh back in my corporate days before i
started dilbert before i had any any
kind of public notoriety
when i was just guy in cubicle
one of the things i noticed was that my
my boss's boss
would quote me
and the first time it happened i thought
oh
look at me saying something
so well that it got quoted by you know a
senior member of
of the company
and then i noticed it happened
again
and uh i realized well before i was
famous i realized that i was quotable
like weirdly quotable
because people were doing it and i i
don't remember a lot of other people who
were being quoted as co-workers like it
was sort of an odd thing but apparently
i had the ability to you know wordsmith
clever little sentences that people like
to quote and um honestly to me
that was the first
signal that i received that i could do
something in public that people would
care about
now i always imagined it like i
visualized it so i imagined myself doing
things in public
long before i had any public
interaction
but i didn't have any
you know reason to think it it was just
a vision
but once once i saw regular people
quoting me
i thought well
there must be something i do with words
that people want to hear
and sure enough turns out
people like to hear me put words
together in a variety of different
formats
so i would look for that by the way so
if you're looking for somebody to you
know maybe
break out from your work situation look
for people that you quote
because it could even be like a kid in
your family
some of you have that situation right
it'll be like a 12 year old in your
family and you find yourself quoting the
12 year old because they actually said
something that was kind of cool and you
actually just liked it
right just keep an eye on that if that
happens more than once
if you find yourself quoting a 12 year
old more than once
buy some stock in that 12 year old
because because that's the kid who's
going somewhere
quoting yourself is
quite
fine how many of you think that my voice
is somehow related to
why you watch this
because in my opinion my voice is
terrible i'm always clearing my throat
and
sneezing and
full of allergies
huh
so a little bit uh both ways
right
yeah i told you before i i listened to
my voice five years ago
on on the joe rogan
show or whatever it was
and it's really different now
so five years ago my voice sounded like
a senior citizen because it was still
weak from the years of not being able to
speak but because i do this for an hour
a day
my voice just got stronger i was
listening to it recently and it
it sounds younger
oh what do you think instead of me
telling you i'll ask you does my current
voice
sound younger than my age
i think it does
but it's only because it's stronger
and i think anybody who practices their
voice muscles
i think if you're if your voice gets
stronger
it makes you feel younger
i mean your register is younger
because i think the the
old person voicing you here is weakness
right
if you listen to an old person it sounds
like there's literally muscle weakness
like
uh
get off of my lawn
you know like there's just no muscle
there
and
speaking is like every other
you know muscle
the more you do the better you can do it
so the fact that i do it a lot
is what makes me age backwards
i do feel like i'm aging backwards in
some ways
um
did you turn off youtube no not yet
all right but i think i'm done
youtube do you have any questions before
i go
yeah my nose always sounds plugged
um you sound like i have a permanent
allergy well that's true
every now and then maybe one out of 20
times
my head is clear from allergies
it does sound very different
i sound good for 75.
all right
uh youtube thanks for joining let's wait
and find out what's happening with this
mar-a-lago stuff and we'll talk to you
tomorrow
