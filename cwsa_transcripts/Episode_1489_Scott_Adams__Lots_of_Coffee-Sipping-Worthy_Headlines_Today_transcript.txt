good
morning everybody
it's time for coffee with scott adams
and i don't have to tell you it's the
best thing in the history of the
universe
not every time
but today for sure absolutely
and if you'd like to take it up to here
to four
unknown levels of pleasure
and i know you do all you need is a
copper mug or a glass a tanker jealous
diana canteen jugger flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
yeah i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day it's the
thing that makes everything better
as long as you do it with me it's called
the simultaneous sip it happens now oh
delicious
now some of you are wondering scott why
is it that you are streaming on youtube
and also the locals
platform but you are not streaming on
the rumble
platform
why is that scott why is that
well
let me describe the rumble onboarding
process
it goes like this
if you'd like to be a creator
click this button and somebody will help
you become a creator account
and then you click click that button and
the next part is easy you just wait
but there's no part after that
apparently you
you asked to be a creator on rumble and
then
there's a thing called nothing that
happens after that
so then nothing happens i've tried that
a couple of times i've also been
contacted by rumble
um employees
and they've offered help
so i've emailed back and said that's
great
just make me a creator account and i'll
be
i'll be live streaming like crazy and
then the process that happens after that
is a nothing
so i've tried
three or four times
to live stream on rumble and each time i
can't i don't know apparently i'm the
only person who's not allowed to live
stream on rumble but
should i ever be allowed i might try to
do that
we'll try to get that solved
here's a tragic story of a a diner a
small business a diner in central
florida
who announced that it would not be
serving anyone who supports president
biden and i guess this is over the
botched and disgraceful
afghan pullout
and well you can imagine what would
happen if you say that you will not
serve
more than half of the public in your
town
and you depend on the public for your
income
it's pretty obvious that if you're a
small business and barely struggling to
get by as it is
it's pretty obvious that if you tell
half of your potential customers that
they can't eat there
you're pretty much going to have to
you're going to be forced to shutter
your business
and that's what happened she was forced
to shutter her business
because she said that she wouldn't even
sell to
half of the people in the community wait
i'm getting an update i'm getting an
update
she was forced to shutter her business
uh but it was because
there was so many customers they ate all
the food
and she didn't have any food left to
serve
okay that's so that's exactly the
opposite of what i thought it would be
it turns out that when you tell half of
your customers to off
you really
it's good marketing
earlier yeah if i'd known that i think i
would have tried it
moving on to the next story a tragic
story not all my stories are happy
this one is tragic
uh there was a woman a high school
biology teacher age 34 who's accused of
having sex with a 14 year old student
um
this is terrible um apparently this
biology teacher
um
had sex with his 14 year old boy during
at least three one-on-one independent
study sessions
now
i think we have to dig a little deeper
into the story
now of course it's tragic and uh i feel
sorry for this poor 14 year old boy he
was a
a victim of this horrible crime
sex with a hot teacher
um
i hope he'll recover
i hope he'll i hope this isn't a
permanent
problem for the rest of his life
but the the victim they talked to the
victim the 14 year old boy who had sex
with his teacher three times
and he was quoted as saying it was quote
the best three days of his life so far
um uh he doesn't think he'll need
therapy therapy
but he said he had agreed to get therapy
under the following condition quote
if the therapist is super hot
so i guess that's sort of a yes um
so the so the child will be treated
probably with therapy
um but i i have this question to ask
this was a biology teacher
now
i'm just going to put this out there
because i don't know if the news is good
at context because you have to consider
everything right
we've talked about the tragedy to the 14
year old boy and
i don't know if he'll ever be the same i
hope he recovers from this
but
we should also say
that when that 14 year old boy took his
biology exams
it turns out he knew more about biology
than all of the other kids in the class
yeah he did
because he had three
independent study sessions on biology
that you just can't get everywhere you
know what i mean you know what i mean
you know what i mean yeah
so that's enough of that tragedy
i have a prediction prediction uh most
of you are
savvy and well-informed people
and
i know that you know
that elon musk recently had
been critical of
bitcoin because it requires gigantic
amounts of energy
to
mine a new coin now if you don't know
cryptocurrency
let me explain that in order to create
a new bitcoin it's created by
uh massive computers crunching things
algorithmically i'm not sure if that's
the right word but
by formula
and only once in a while can it discover
or mine as they say
um a new combination that will be a new
bitcoin
so without getting too technical to
create a bitcoin you need a computer and
there were very few bitcoins in
production you could use just your own
little computer and they could maybe
find a bitcoin for you
but as the number of bitcoins continue
to get mined they are harder and harder
to find mathematically they're harder to
find so you need bigger and bigger
computers
to find the increasingly rare bitcoins
that are left
and
so it takes entire data centers now
to just find some bitcoins and it's it's
a pretty big drag on climate change
say the experts i mean it could be like
half a one percent of all the energy
used it's pretty big number
um
so here's my prediction someday a
billionaire will build a gen 4 nuclear
power plant just to mine bitcoins
now this
said billionaire would have to find a
country that was you know willing to
allow a
you know more experimental nuclear power
plant but because you're using it to bit
to mine bitcoin
you can put it anywhere
right your your nuclear power plant
doesn't need to be near a power it
doesn't need to be near a population
center
in fact that would be the worst place to
put it
the best place to put it if you're only
going to use it for your own
bitcoin mining operation
the best place to put it would be as far
from humans as possible so if something
went wrong
no problem
now the generation 4 nuclear plants are
built so such that nothing big can go
wrong
if if everything fails
here's here's the idiot's definition of
generation three versus generation four
generation three
which would be the kind of power plant
you would you would build today you know
kind of a traditional one
if you have a major problem
it could lead to some kind of a meltdown
situation that would be bad
but generation 4 would be designed such
that the problem itself
would cause the
the power plant to shut down
so instead of a
design where a problem causes a massive
potential problem
generation four the same problem or
let's say conceptually the same kind of
problem
would cause it just to turn off
so that's a pretty big difference right
major you know chernobyl meltdown versus
oh it's off now
that's it
so yeah you're gonna
i suspect that bitcoin could
become a huge driver of generation four
nuclear power so bitcoin could actually
become the financial incentive
to have a robust generation four
nuclear industry maybe
who knows i'll put that out there
there's nothing funny about death
let me start this uh story by saying
when people die
there's nothing funny about that
and if you laugh
at a story in which people die
well you're a bad person and you're
going to have to
deal with that for the rest of your life
live in shame
live in shame if you laugh at this
following story which is tragic
turns out that the taliban tried to
celebrate a
victory
against some rebels in the uh panshir
valley
turns out it was a
premature celebration
it turns out that they did not have a
victory yet it was premature
but they decided to celebrate anyway as
the taliban do by
firing their weapons in the air
uh so many taliban fired their weapons
in the air
falsely believing that they'd won
a war against the rebels
and uh when the taliban fired all their
weapons in the air
they didn't count on gravity
gravity kind of snuck them and bit them
in the ass and a lot of those bullets
fell down after they went up
resulting in the death of 17 people and
injuring
41. now if you're laughing about that
you're a bad bad person
oh bad people
bad people i see you in the comments
don't be laughing at death
even if it's a taliban
well first of all we don't know if it
was the taliban where the 17 people
killed could have been anybody
probably innocent people the way things
go
but not funny
however
it does open up a possibility
is it possible
that joe biden was this close
for those of you listening i'm putting
my finger and my thumb
in a very short distance from each other
is it possible that joe biden was this
close
from a major victory against the taliban
maybe
and here's how that could have looked
the taliban you think won an unexpected
11 day victory and took over
afghanistan with almost no resistance
that's what the news told you
or
was it a trap
because if the taliban took over really
quickly
and they still had a lot of ammo left
over because they didn't need to use it
because they took over so quickly
what would the taliban do with all of
that ammo left over
to celebrate their victory over
afghanistan which they've tried
20 years to take back what would they do
would they
shoot their weapons in the air
and would they have so much ammo
because they didn't have any resistance
in the actual war
that those bullets would come down and
wipe out the taliban
okay it's a long shot
it's literally a long shot
up in the air and it comes back down
so
i think
biden was this close again if you're
listening to this adams is putting his
finger and his thumb within a close
distance to each other
almost
could have worked
now you say to yourself scott that was a
bad plan
really you're going to coax them into
shooting in the air and hoping enough
bullets fall down to wipe out the
taliban without hitting any innocent
people what's a terrible plan
is it
is it a terrible plan
compared to what we actually did
yeah
now it doesn't look so bad does it
yeah
if you compare it to the right
alternative
which is what we did cut and run
looks pretty smart so it could have
worked
worth a shot worth a shot
it was worth a shot
well uh turns out that artificial
intelligence is super racist
um do not laugh at this joke
because you would be labeling yourself
as a racist
just like ai
you don't want to be that
don't be a racist and don't laugh at
this joke there's nothing funny about it
but facebook recently apologized after
an ai program facebook ai
mistakenly labeled a video featured
featuring black men interacting with the
police as quote
about primates
don't laugh
don't laugh you bastards
stop it
it
all right
now
apparently an automatic prompt came up
and it says do you want to keep seeing
videos about primates
despite the video clearly featuring nope
no primates whatsoever
but here's my question
wait a minute wait a minute
are we analyzing this story correctly
because the story says they were quote
black men in the videos
but there were also
police officers
do you see where i'm going here
do we have confirmation
that the
that the ai was confused by the quote
black men in the video
or
was it confused by the police officers
who wore
uniforms that were the same color all
over
uh yeah
now you don't know what to think that's
a norma mcdonald line one of my favorite
lines i don't know what to think
because
police officers were the ones the ai
thought were the primates
because they were literally uniform
in color
because they might have had you know
full uniforms that were all this
i mean if you look at let's say a
gorilla
what would be the distinguishing
characteristics of a gorilla
same color all over
right
so the gorilla is the same color all
over
just like a police uniform
i don't know
if the ai was looking at faces and
making a racist kind of a conclusion
probably probably i mean it's reasonable
assumption
but why do we go to that automatically
why do you automatically think that the
iai thought that the black men were the
primates as opposed to the police
officers
maybe the article itself is racist
because you can't tell
which ones the ai was looking at
right
can't tell
so you would have to be a racist
yourself
gotcha gotcha you'd have to be a racist
yourself
to assume
that the ai was looking at the black men
in the video
because i don't think that was an
evidence
all we know is that the ai thought there
were some primates in the video
so why are you so racist that you think
it was the black people in the video
well i think you should be ashamed of
yourself
by the way i don't think that um
any
nothing in the things look like other
things and remind me of other things
have any meaning
are you all adult enough to know that
right like even if
you said to yourself hey i think you
know some person's reminding me of a
primate it doesn't mean anything
it just means that you were reminded of
something
like to give that any importance would
be ridiculous
um
jonathan turley tweets and you should be
following jonathan turley on twitter one
of the best follows
um
he says there's a program at boulder
university i guess that encourages
faculty to quote uh shed the
cultural norms of white supremacy so
what are these cultural norms of white
supremacy well among them
in your attempt to quote decolonize the
classes
you should be rejecting neoliberal
concepts
so what are some neoliberal concepts we
would like to reject well among them
perfectionism
and a sense of urgency
now when i was coming up in the business
world i was told literally and
continuously
that a sense of urgency was exactly what
i wanted to develop if i didn't have it
already
that in fact success this was not the
phone company they would use this
language all the time
the phone company would use the sense of
urgency to tell you you should be
working hard and act like everything's
important
but it turns out that that sense of
urgency the very
the very qualities and perfectionism the
very kinds of qualities which might lead
one to success you could argue about the
perfectionism one
um
are maybe a little bit too white
supremacist a little bit too white
supremacist
so uh
this program will try to get rid of that
but here's a question
for you
hmm
it raises an interesting question
let's say that we accept
this
premise
let's say we accept the premise that we
should not be living in a
uh white supremacist cultural norm
anybody have a problem with that
i think we can reject
white supremacy as a cultural norm i
mean if you could get rid of it
that'd be fair
right you live in america damn it nobody
should be having any supremacy
that's the whole point of america so of
course we'd like to get rid of any
cultural norms of white supremacy if
they were real
but here's the question
if you could damn perfectionism and damn
a sense of urgency as why a supremacist
couldn't you damn
success itself
isn't
success the way we define it you know in
economic terms and
in the west
isn't that
white supremacist
and shouldn't we
and shouldn't the boulder program try to
get rid of success
entirely
because success is what up
everything
if nobody succeeded
you wouldn't have to worry about income
distribution nobody'd have any
and if nobody succeeded real
big
yeah
i see your comic eric calling that
uniquely white is pretty racist
isn't it
imagine you're a
i'm just trying to get in the heads of
other people right it's impossible but
just imagine put yourself in this place
you're successful black entrepreneur
all right put yourself in that hat
you're you you are a successful black
entrepreneur you've made it like you
really you killed it you got stuff done
you made some money you've really done
well
and then some tells you that
you should get rid of your sense of
urgency and your perfectionism and your
other traits and you what do you say to
yourself
i mean i don't know because
that's not me
but i feel like if you put me in that
situation i'd be pretty angry about this
because i think to myself wait a minute
i wasn't trying to be white
i was trying to
succeed
and if trying to succeed made me look
like i was trying too hard to be white
who the hell is telling me that
right you imagine you're you're a black
entrepreneur wouldn't you be pretty
offended by that
it's like oh the only way you can
succeed is by acting white
how about no
how about i was able to succeed by doing
the things that everybody who succeeds
does
same stuff
i mean doesn't matter what color you are
you pretty much do the same basket of
stuff to succeed
so anyway
um
recently uh several several of uh
dan
ariely's i hope i'm pronouncing his last
name right so he's an author and
researcher and a guy and he's been
writing books about behavioral science
but it turns out that a lot of
behavioral science studies don't hold up
and one of them was a study that said
that if you ask people to declare that
they're going to be honest at the end of
a form
they're more likely to lie and then at
the end say uh yeah
sure i'll be honest then if you put
their declaration at the front and the
thinking was that if you make people say
yes i'll be honest before they answer
the questions
they'll be biased toward being more
honest because they committed to it but
it turns out you can't reproduce that
can't be reproduced so that would be uh
just another example of behavioral
science that just
it's just can't be reproduced
now
i also have my questions about why that
wouldn't work
because everything i know about
persuasion and brains and hypnos
suggests that it would work that putting
it first would make a difference
so i'm not sure which one to doubt
should i doubt the studies that couldn't
reproduce it
or should i doubt
um i don't know i guess i doubt
everything so
behavioral science
comes pretty close to guessing it turns
out
um
so here's a mystery that i think i've
got i'm gonna try to explain this as
best i can
uh i like to think that one of my
superpowers is explaining complicated
things
in simple ways
so so that's my challenge to myself
here's a complicated thing and i'll see
if i can explain it to you for the first
time in a simple way i'm not sure i can
but i got some help from
andres backhouse on twitter and
some other tweets but here's
here's the conundrum
so israel
is reporting that most of their new
infections are of vaccinated people
so that makes some people say wait a
minute
if most of the people getting a new
infection are vaccinated
doesn't that tell you the vaccinations
don't work and the answer is no it's not
telling you that at all
apparently israel is very happy with how
well the vaccinations work
but it's also true
simultaneously that infections among the
vaccinated apparently are higher
than the unvaccinated
so does that tell you that the
vaccinations are
making it worse
no
here's why
children are still mostly not vaccinated
and still mostly don't get it
right
so children
are mostly not vaccinated
and also mostly don't get it
for whatever reason whereas older people
or at least they're not getting you know
hospitalized
whereas older people whether they're
vaccinated or not
if you're old enough and you get it well
there's a good chance you get
hospitalized anyway
so
so you've got this situation where
you're looking at very different groups
with different risk profiles
so any imbalance and the size of those
groups just changes your whole average
it makes your average ridiculous so if
on average
the people who are vaccinated are more
likely to be infected
am i saying that wrong
let's say it a different way if on
average
most of the infections are with
vaccinated people
that has everything to do with the size
of the population of vaccinated people
with the size of the population of the
kids who are unvaccinated
so as long as you know that the average
doesn't mean anything because you're
averaging two things that are just like
an apple and an orange
maybe that helps
i think i did a terrible job
usually i'm better than this
is there anybody who knows knows what i
should have said to know if i'm even
close
but the basic idea is
that uh there's nothing wrong with the
israeli vaccinations
that they're actually super effective
against for keeping you out of the
hospital and keeping you alive
but it might not look that way and it's
just because how numbers work
apparently trump said recently that he
wouldn't get a booster
now it was reported that when trump said
he he was thinking about not getting a
booster that it probably wasn't he said
i'm not against it but it probably isn't
for me
and i saw cnn say oh yeah you know
that's that's not so good because then
all the trump people will say
hey
if he's not getting a booster then why
should i get one
but what did they leave out of the story
yeah i'll just leave the comments what
did what did cnn leave out of the story
that he already had coveted
he already had it
come on
come on guys
news industry
seriously
you're not going to put that in the
story
the most important fact that he had
already had covered and that gives him a
kind of immunity which science
says is way better than a booster
is is trump making the wrong decision
i i don't know
but if i had had the if i had recovered
i know if i'd recovered and maybe i had
the wherewithal to test my antibodies
anyway
i think i would think twice about a
booster wouldn't you
so they're they're treating it as if
trump is being unscientific or giving
bad advice when as far as i can tell
he's completely compatible with the
science
and is giving good advice
for himself
he told you that he's not against it so
he's not telling you what to do he's
just saying for himself his special case
i think he's probably right
so
that's some fake news there
um
all right so i'm going to play you a
little video um
so last night
this will just tell you how weird my
life is
so here's a little background uh greg
goffeld got an interview with
trump
so the interview has not aired yet i
believe it'll air this coming week
uh probably wednesday-ish tentatively
and maybe maybe a spread over a few days
we'll see
but
so uh greg goffeld was with
trump uh yesterday for the interview and
i think they got something after with a
bunch of other people
and then i get this video
scott
there's a man here that wants to say
hello to you hey scott i want to tell
you you're a man of great common sense
and i really enjoy listening to you and
you've been generally speaking a fan for
a long time you agree with what i'm
doing but keep up the good work up with
greg and some of his friends we did an
interview and
thank you for everything scott keep up
the good work awesome thank you
i i i told you my life is weird right
i swear to god i wake up and i don't
know what's going to happen in any any
freaking day
so yeah that was that was trump giving
me a uh
a little personal video message
how weird is that
so
um
i guess one of the advantages of having
the number one uh you know evening show
uh which greg gutfeld has
is that you get a lot of you get a lot
of good interviews so i would encourage
you all to watch that interview um can
you just imagine
just think about it you say you know
greg guffeld and you know trump
is there any chance that this isn't a
good interview
you know it's going to be fun
so i can't wait to see that
all
right you know what i would love to see
a risk management worksheet maybe it
could even be an excel you know
something simple anybody could use could
it could be a website where there's just
some programming to do it but i think
there should always be some kind of
government
blessed
thing with the odds and they would
change of course as we learn new things
about what the odds are we change the
odds but you should be able to just fill
in your own situation
you know stuff like
you know can you socially distance
what's your
your age your comorbil
morbidities
and then put in stuff like uh what is
the known risk
of getting vaccinated
and then then make some guesses about
the the long-term unknown risk
and
you know you'd have to put in your own
assumptions so people would get
different results based on their own
assumptions
plus the official scientific assumptions
and shouldn't we be doing that
why in the world do you and i have a
dumbass conversation about whether or
not it's a good idea for you to get
vaccinated
that's like the dumbest conversation
that any two humans can have
because your situation and mine aren't
even close
and what are the odds that you're in the
same situation i am risk-wise and
everything else
zero
so i should be making my decision you
should be making your decision and
that's it right your decision and my
decision don't need to
be compatible
they shouldn't be there's no reason for
them to be
so why don't we just reduce it to math
and just say look
here's the worksheet
okay grandma
you watched uh
somebody some pundit now you don't want
to get vaccinated so just work do the
worksheet and if the worksheet comes out
and says yeah you know in your situation
let's say you were already infected like
trump
if trump did the worksheet
would it tell him to get a booster
what do you think
if trump did a worksheet
to figure out the odds his best odds
of what would be the biggest risk and
reward
in his specific case because he already
had the infection
and he can probably monitor his
his antibody level i'd be surprised if
they're not doing that once a month
right if you're an ex-president
you've got all the money in the world
yeah you're probably looking at your
antibodies every month or so
so a new special case
different than other people right
all right i'd just like to put that out
there because we're arguing about stuff
that should just be math it should just
be in a worksheet
you know with your assumptions of course
now here's
what i thought was a cnn typo or error
and i still believe it is so here's
something the cnn says on its website
that i tell you in advance
i think that i think they're saying the
opposite of what is true right so i'll
tell you what they're saying
but i believe it's the opposite of truth
and i think it's just a typo
of the 10 states with the worst coveted
19 case rate now this is not deaths
and this is not hospitalization this is
just number of people infected
over the past week
seven of them so 7 out of 10 also had
among the 10 best
vaccination rates
so this would suggest that the highest
vaccinated
states
are also having the most infections
is that true
or is that opposite of true
well um andre spekos
looked at the data and he said it looks
like it's the opposite of true
that in fact the least vaccinated states
are the ones with the most infections
so i'm not sure what cnn was trying to
say but that's a pretty gigantic error
if it's an error which it looks like
so it could be i'm reading it wrong or
maybe i'm interpreting it wrong or
something but it's the opposite
it looks the opposite of what i believe
to be true
so let's say
let's say that it's been fact checked by
andres
but again i think either one of us could
be wrong about what they thought they
meant i don't know it could be just an
interpretation problem but it looks
wrong
i'm also in the middle of this
matt gates story is anybody following
that
so you know that matt gates uh now has
been semi-vindicated meaning that
there were two parts of the story one is
that uh he was being charged with
allegations about something with a 17
year old girl
we have no actual victim come forward no
details no evidence i've seen no
evidence that any that's true
it's it's just an allegation
but the other part of it was that he he
claimed he was being blackmailed in some
weird scheme for 25 million or his dad
was
and that he would end up with some kind
of immunity for his
alleged other problems that don't have
any evidence that i've seen
and so it's this big weird story but
um
you might know that i was also
sort of part of it accidentally
because as matt gates
forwarded on twitter some private
messages between jake novak
who works at the moment at the israeli
consulate he's american but he works at
the israeli consulate and
he asks some questions about it
now
the question you want to ask is how does
matt gates have a private message
from jake novak to me
how does he have that
and
the answer is
i don't know
which is funny
of itself i actually don't know
i can think of at least four ways he
could have it
but i don't know i mean i didn't give it
to him directly
i will tell you i showed it to one
person
who has experience in the you know law
enforcement intel world
doesn't work there but has experience
with that world
just to get a second opinion
because when i saw it um
all of my spider senses
tingled
there was just something wrong with it
that felt like a national security
problem or not
and i just needed a second opinion so i
did show it to one person
um
but
on top of that
and then i don't know what happened
after that but
on top of that
i assume
that because we're talking about you
know a foreign nation
uh i assume that my communication is all
uh compromised
and i assume
that probably uh
you know jake novak's communications are
probably compromised
um and i would think that you know
various intel agencies are probably
watching everything i do
now
um
without getting into any details i do
know for sure
that at least
three to four
intelligence agencies have been curious
about me let's just say they've been
scot curious
and part of the question was who i
worked for
right so apparently i was a little too
influential
and
it caused people to wonder who i was
really working for
surprise
i'm a patriot
i don't work for anybody
and i think it's weird
that
uh
that people even have to ask the
question
is everybody so bought off that that you
can't have somebody who literally just
wants what's best for the country
now everybody of course wants what's
best for themselves and their family
and that's just normal but can't you
beyond that just want what's best for
your country
that
it's not an option
why not
so i guess i don't know um enough about
the details of what's happening in this
story but i will just tell you one thing
that if you look at those messages that
are now in the in the public domain
um you can see that i was deeply
skeptical of the black male story the
alleged blackmail story it wasn't called
that at the time
and it appears that based on
the indictment my skepticism was on
point
so the only the only thing i want to add
to the story is
from the first moment i heard it it
sounded like it was sketchy
and it turns out there is something
sketchy about it
or at least enough to get an indictment
but we don't know exactly the whole
story so we'll still wait for that
um
george soros is tweeting about the
taliban and uh he makes a good point he
says the taliban's behavior raises
serious concerns
about their commitment to respecting
human rights
i'll just leave that there for a moment
just let that settle in a little bit
let that marinate
okay you good
you good
i'm gonna read it again because you're
probably thinking wait did i hear that
right
yes according to george soros he's a
little bit concerned
because the taliban's behavior raises
serious concerns about their commitment
to respecting human rights
yes george
it turns out we found your limit
we we found out the point at which
george soros would say
wait a minute
i'm not so sure this is going in the
right direction
it turns out it's a taliban
socialism
cool
open borders
no problem
taliban
taliban you're on the watch list
you
might not be as cool as i thought you at
first
so
george zarosa having little second
thoughts about the awesomeness of the
taliban
good to know
but
am i anti-george soros
well here's the problem george soros is
being very anti-china at the moment and
he's warning us that china has big
trouble coming and investors should uh
beware
what happens when george soros
one of the most legendary best investors
of all times
tells you to keep your investments away
from china or at least beware of
investing in china
what happens
well it ain't good for china
because if george soros tells you not to
invest in china or at least that there's
you know bigger danger than it looks
like
he really doesn't like china
that guy that guy hates china
and he doesn't seem to be a fan of
president xi
so
hate to tell you this but
enemy of my enemy
you know where i'm going
hate to say it
enemy of my enemy
so i'm gonna be pro george soros when
he's anti-china
anything else he's gonna have to defend
a little bit better like his open
borders etc
but uh
it's kind of interesting to see the
soros is going after china
keep an eye on that
all right
that
yes
that
is the
incredible content that i had for you
now i know i know you're begging for
more because it was so damn good
so damn good
uh oh stefan says that uh soros is
probably shorting china
that's a good point he probably is yeah
now that's legal right you can shorten
something and then talk it down
as long as you're not lying i think
i believe you can do that i think that's
legal
as long as everything's transparent it's
legal
all right
um
i'm just looking at some of your
comments as they go by
where has boo been uh
well i got a little bad news about boo
um
boo uh has little health problems but i
don't know what it is yet
she's a little unstable on her feet and
i think she has a concussion
actually
so i didn't see anything happen but
she's not uh she's not walking right at
the moment so i'm gonna
get her checked out
um she looks healthy
just she's got one eye dilated in one
knot and
it's not good
so
um
your cat is all sketchy too
could be worms somebody says well
yeah but you know the one eye is dilated
more than the other that's usually a
concussion isn't it or a stroke i
suppose so
yeah it could be any one of those but
i'll get that checked out i don't think
there's anything i can do about it
uh could be an ear infection but an ear
infection would resolve itself faster i
believe
sounds like a stroke maybe
yeah so i've been giving her eye
vermectin no just kidding
no i've rebecca
um
i'll give her eye for mexican for worms
maybe
um
oh so christina's today's her first day
of actual um
aerobatic
flying competition
so she's in a redlands
uh california where they're having an
aerial show
and it's her first competition so she's
competing in the you know the entry
level
area
and that'll happen sometime today i
don't know the exact schedule of the
flights
um do you worry about her risk
yes
but you know analyzing risk is sort of a
weird thing
so here's the pro in the con
if you hear that your spouse wants to
fly airplanes upside down and
do tricks in the air
what's the first thing you think
well that's pretty dangerous right i
mean it's scary
but there are two things you need to
know one is that the height that you are
in the air is the biggest factor for
whether you're safe so when they do the
air shows they're they do them high
enough up that if you were to let's say
lose your
i don't know balance or lose your
control of the airplane
and you're three thousand feet in the
air
and you're a trained aerobatics pilot
it's actually not that dangerous
because if you're trained aerobatics
pilot for fun you put your plane into a
spin
so that the most dangerous thing a plane
can do is to get into a spin
heading down
but aerobatic pilots do that just for
practice
they'll just kill their engine put it
into a spin you know thousands of feet
in the air and see if they can recover
before they hit the ground
right now generally they're trained well
enough that they can recover almost
immediately so they don't get close to
the ground they just they can recover
the moment they they lose their control
so
here's the weird part about it
if you're a trained aerobatics pilot
but you happen to be flying some other
kind of plane one day
and you get into a spin
an aerobatics pilot can get out of it a
regular pilot has never been in one
it'll be the first time
and their their reflexes won't
necessarily
lead them in the right direction there's
something sort of
non-obvious about getting out of a spin
i don't know the details but um
so here's here's here's the risk reward
to be an aerobatics pilot add some risk
while you're doing the aerobatics but
to be a trained aerobatics pilot makes
your other flying way safer
so what's the net of that i don't know i
don't know
i can't remember the last time an
aerobatics pilot died
can you think of a time when was the
last time you heard an aerobatics pilot
died
i don't think it happens very often
because as long as they stay high enough
in the air they can pretty much recover
anything and they can land anywhere
because they're that good they find a
road flat flat field they can pretty
much land anywhere
so that's all i got for now and i will
talk to you
