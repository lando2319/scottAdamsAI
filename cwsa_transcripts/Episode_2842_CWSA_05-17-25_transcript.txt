Hey
everybody, we're going to have a show
for the
ages or
not. There we go. Just want to see your
comments.
[Music]
Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
it's the best thing that ever happened
to you. But if you want to take it up to
levels that no one can understand with
their tiny shiny human brains. All you
need for that is a copper mug or a
glass, a tanker, just dying a canteen
jug or flask, a vessel of any kind. Fill
it with your favorite liquid. I like
coffee. And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day thing makes everything better.
It's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens
now.
Good. Well, I got to warn you that I'm
uh so tired I've been hallucinating. And
there's a nonzero possibility that I
will actually fall
asleep during the show. And I mean that
seriously. So if you see me fall asleep,
you don't need to call 911. I'm just
really, really tired. And if I start
hallucinating or talking like Joe Biden
talking to uh special counsel her, don't
worry about that either. Um, I just need
a nap. So, usually on Saturday, Owen
Gregorian does his spaces uh event after
I'm done, but he's got a conflict. So,
he'll be doing that on Sunday. So, if
you're looking for the spaces after the
show, it'll be on Sunday, not Saturday
this week. All
right. Well, let's check the world of
science.
Um MIT says it uh no longer stands
behind a student's AI research
paper. So some student an economics
graduate who is no longer with MIT uh
did this paper that got a lot of uh
attention because he said that uh AI had
been used to
uh in the material science lab and led
to all kinds of gains and discoveries.
Um, but the scientists who used it were
sad that it worked. Turns out none of
that was true and wasn't based on any
science at
all. It was completely made up appar
apparently because there were no
sources. So, and the the author of the
paper is no longer at
MIT. So, there's that.
Um, in case you were worried that uh
Trump wasn't doing
anything, uh, he's insulting Taylor
Swift. So, so Trump posted on truth. Has
anyone noticed that since I said I hate
Taylor Swift, she's no longer
hot? Which caused Bill Maher and other
people to be trying to sort out? Wait,
does he mean she's no longer attractive
hot or her career is no longer zooming?
It doesn't matter. It's funny either
way.
The fact that Trump would spend one
second on this particular topic is once
again just hilarious. I I I can't get
enough of that. But he also uh had some
words for Bruce Springsteen because
Springsteen was in doing a concert in
another country and he was criticizing
uh Trump. He says that uh in the truth
social, which was a long long one, he
said that uh Springsteen is dumb as a
rock.
Um and
uh oh my god, I was hallucinating when I
wrote down this
note. I was going to read it the
sentence, but the sentence doesn't make
any sense at all. Oh my god. This did
out prune of a
rocker. Okay, that's definitely not what
he said. Um, his skin is all atrophied.
Now, that part did
say I think it's so funny that uh Trump
goes after a political opponent by
talking about his skin being
atrophied. That's pretty good. Anyway,
um Daily Mail is reporting that
um there's going to be possibly there's
a bill being introduced by a Republican
from Ohio, Warren
Davidson, the Trump Derangement Syndrome
Research
Act. And uh the the uh the bill is to
try to get some research into the
phenomenon of Trump derangement syndrome
so that we can understand the causes and
maybe maybe the solution. Well, here's
one of those things where maybe you
should just ask Scott. Scott,
um what do you think is the cause of
TDS?
Um, I've got the answer to that. It's
fake news. If he removed the fake news,
do you think there would be any
TDS? No, there wouldn't. It is entirely
a phenomenon of fake news, which then
gets into social media as well. But you
don't need to study this, Representative
Davidson, although I think it's
hilarious that you proposed it.
All right. Um, and they say it won't
cost taxpayers a
dime.
Good. Well, Netflix
um has unleashed, according to
interesting ad engineering, an AI
powered bin roll ads. So, the AI will
determine your mood somehow, which is
weird and and eerie, and it will push
ads to you based on your, I guess, your
personality and how they think you feel
that day. I don't know how they figured
that out, but guess AI will be doing it.
So, did you have any questions about
TDS? Of course,
the it it's obvious that the news
coverage is what caused TDS. And if you
weren't convinced of that, then why does
Netflix think it can manipulate you by
their ads? It's the same thing. If if
you're if you're a captive audience and
you're staring at a screen, they can
make some percentage of you do just
about anything, including buying
products and going crazy.
Well, the Border Patrol saw a 44% spike
in
applications after Trump got elected.
The postmillennial is reporting on this.
Uh, but here's the part that is not
funny, but it's funny. Can we agree on
that? So, the next thing I tell you is
not funny at all. There's nothing funny
about it, except it's kind of funny. So,
we're going to do some contrast. The
contrast is that when Trump is the
president, there's a 44% spike in
applications for the Border Patrol.
But apparently under
Biden uh the morale of the border patrol
was so bad that they actually hired
something called a
suicidologist in
2021. So under Trump, people are
scrambling to try to get jobs and under
Biden they were trying to keep them
alive so that they didn't hate their
jobs so much they would kill themselves.
There's nothing funny about that. Stop
laughing. There's nothing funny about
that. I told you. All
right. There's nothing funny about this
next story either. Uh did you hear about
the uh accused serial killer in Florida
who was uh given a chance to say his
last words before he was executed.
and his last words were, "President
Trump, keep making America great. I'm
ready to
go." How long did he think about what
his last words would be? And at what
point did he decide he was going to he
was going to
say, "Keep making America great, Trump."
I don't know. Well, there goes another
Trump voter.
There's nothing funny about that.
Nothing funny about that. All
right. Um, there's a new bipartisan bill
that's being introduced. Fox News is
talking about it that would allow the
military to shoot down drones that are
over our military bases. Apparently,
um, in the last year or so, there have
been
350 drone sightings over military bases,
which I guess we think most of them or
all of them or some percentage of them
were enemies spying on our
bases. So, at the moment, it's not legal
to just start blazing away. I don't know
what kind of weapon they would use, but
they're going to if this passes, and
it's bipartisan, so pretty good chance
it will. Um, the military would be able
to knock them out of the air. It'd be
good
practice. Um, here's the worst idea that
Switzerland ever
had. It looks really good in the video,
but it's got to be the worst idea I've
ever heard. So Switzerland is putting
solar panels
uh on train
tracks, but these are active train
tracks. So you know the the in between
part of the rails, you got all this
space and it's just sitting there. So
Switzerland decided uh it's a I think
it's still in trial uh to put solar
panels between the rails and they
they've got them so that the train
doesn't touch them. Now problem number
one, if you have solar
panels, they're really a lot more
effective if they're facing the
direction of the sun. If they're if
they're facing straight up, you you're
already giving up what 30% of all your
efficiency. Number two,
um I don't know if you know this, but
trains can cause some
vibration. Are you aware of that? In
fact, there are very few things that
cause more more vibration than a train
going over a solar panel. I can't
believe that they're not going to have
the biggest maintenance problem in the
world. And then number three, I don't
know what things are like in
Switzerland, but in the United States,
if you put a bunch of solar panels on
the
ground, people would just break them
with
rocks. No reason, just because they
could. So, you got a problem with, you
know, maybe vandals breaking them,
unless Switzerland doesn't have any
vandals. I don't know, maybe they're
special that way. But no, I'm not uh I'm
not thinking that this will sweep the
world. I think Switzerland's got some
problems
going. Well, China says that their
humanoid robots won't take your job or
anybody's job. uh they'll simply boost
the efficiency of the current employees.
It's not going to replace them. It's
just going to boost their
productivity. Uh do you believe
that? Do you believe that they will do
nothing but boost your
productivity? Well, I would say that
depends a great deal on what job you're
talking
about. If you're talking about a job
that's literally just carrying things
from one place to another,
maybe that will replace your job. But if
it's uh a lot of variability and you
need a person there to to figure out if
the robot's doing the right thing, well
then maybe maybe it won't take your job.
Reuters is reporting on this.
Well, have you heard yet the uh the
audio of uh Biden being interviewed by
special counsel her? So, we'd seen the
transcripts, but we had not heard him
talking. And uh it's as bad as you
imagined
it. Uh Biden didn't remember the year
that his son died. Um, and then then
even when he was told he got it wrong
again and he started rambling about his
dead
son, which wasn't even the answer to the
question, I don't think. And you could
see why special counsel her said that
there was no point in prosecuting him
because you would just look like a, you
know, a forgetful old man. It's pretty
bad.
So, so here's what I want to add to the
fact that uh Democrats are acting like,
well, how could we have possibly known?
I mean, we didn't hear the her audio.
Well, I'm going to add to that. How
could they possibly have
known? And
also, was there even one Democrat who
pointed out even
one that Biden ran on the fine people
hoax, which wasn't even
real? Do you recall even one
Democrat saying, "Well, your entire
campaign theme is based on a
lie."
No. That's all you need to know. If they
can't even point out that the entire
campaign was built on one of the most
easily debunked
hoaxes, then obviously they don't care
that he was mentally I mean,
that they wouldn't care about that at
all. And now Jake Tapper is uh he's
modifying his message a little bit to
say that, you know, he needs to have
some humility about the fact that he
didn't catch it.
He didn't catch it early. Does anybody
believe anything that Jake Tapper is
saying about this
topic? Unbelievable.
Well, Harry Anon, the data guy on CNN,
um was talking about a new Reuters Ipsos
poll that uh shows that Trump's uh uh
popularity had gone down quite a bit,
but seems to have recovered. Uh in late
April, he was uh eight points
underwater, but uh he's already
recovered almost all that. He's up seven
points to a negative one net
favorability. And as Harry Anton says,
this is not the picture I think a lot of
people were thinking that we would be
painting in late April. I think a lot of
people expected his approval to keep
dropping, but in fact it rose. Now
that's almost entirely based on people
were afraid of the tariffs, right? And
then then after he said, "Oh, we'll take
down the tariffs or give China 90 days
or something," then everybody said, "Oh,
okay. I think it was mostly based on
that." I don't I don't think the timing
would have included his Middle East
trip, which was a big
success. Well, you've heard of uh the
big beautiful bill that is the the
budget bill that Trump's trying to get
passed.
um apparently it's already been voted
down by the first committee
um by
2116. Now that's a committee vote.
That's not the whole Congress. So I
guess they'll have to go back and
negotiate and change things. Now, the
the budget, of course, is a complete
failure by the Republicans and by Trump
because it does not address the deficit
in any meaningful way and that's the
only thing that matters. Every
everything else is optional, but the
deficit will kill us. So, they've
decided not to do anything about that.
The sticking
points seem to be the uh salt
deductions. That's a state and uh local
tax deductions. So the blue states
mostly like California and New Jersey,
New York um have very high state
taxes. It wasn't long ago before Trump
when you could deduct those from your
federal taxes. So I mean it was a
deduction, not a not a subtraction.
But, uh, there's a big, uh, conversation
about whether those should come back and
if they do, at what
level.
Um, you know, I don't know if you know
this, but my taxes, I'm pretty sure went
up
uh when Trump does did his first tax
reduction because if you're in
California and you lose your state and
local tax deduction, which by the way, I
don't see why we deserve it. Why do we
deserve some kind of special treatment
because our state is so poorly run that
our taxes are
high? Why does that give me the right to
a
deduction? It never made sense. So, I
never really argued against it. But I
think when when I lost my salt deduction
that I ended up paying more even though
my
um my tax rate went down. So, Trump
actually raised my
taxes. Uh, I think I'm pretty sure he
raised my taxes. Uh, anyway, there's
also some uh conversation about
Medicaid.
Um, the weasels the the weasel
Republicans
um are trying to add some kind of work
requirement. So, you have to be in
college or you have to be doing some
public service or have a job or you
won't get Medicaid. But they don't want
that that to kick in until 2028 after
the presidential
election. So, I don't know if you could
be more lame than that.
you know, they come up with an idea that
would kick people off, but it's a clever
idea because it only kicks off people
that you think are lazy or not
contributing. But 5 billion people would
lose their Medicaid under this work
requirement. But they push it to
2028 where probably it'll be reversed
before
then. So that's like not even
trying. Not even trying.
According to the Wall Street Journal, US
oil production, I was kind of expecting
this, is going to decline in 2026. Not a
ton, but it won't go up. And I guess the
shale companies are slowing production
because the price of oil is
down. Um, and we might be, you know,
reaching peak oil in terms of what we
have to to get out of the ground.
Anyway, I don't know about that peak oil
part, but
um so if you thought that low oil
prices were a good sign, they're a good
sign in some ways. You know, Putin won't
have as much money to, you know, wages
war. Um, but in other ways it's just
going to cause people to drill for less
oil and then prices will go back
up. So oil's kind oil is kind of
uh kind of hard to evaluate because it's
got the negative and the positive at the
same time all the time.
Um, according to Wall Street apes,
um, there's a story here about Ted Cruz
who was talking to the chief diversity
officer of the State Department and
apparently they had a hiring
policy and Ted Cruz was getting to the
bottom of it. include an email that was
sent out from the chief diversity
officer saying that white men, straight
white men, and being Christian was a
disability and those people can't be
hired.
So that was as bad as you thought it
was.
Unbelievable.
Um, a disability being a white man.
This was the State Department. It's not
even a private
company. I mean, what what can you do
except just shake your head? I feel all
those uh the these South
African whites who are coming here to
get away from South
Africa, I feel if they knew how bad
things were here, they might they might
have gone back. I don't know.
Anyway, Syria is now talking to Israel
about joining the Abraham
Accords and Trump is allegedly brokered
that. Do you think that's going to
happen? Do you think Syria and Israel
are going to start getting along and
Syria will join the Abraham Accords?
Maybe. Maybe. I wouldn't rule it out.
So, that might be some good news
coming. All right. So, I didn't want to
talk about James Comey and his
8647, but it's just all over the news.
So, we got to, you know, my opinion was
that it's it was innocent because 86
just means get rid of food. I mean,
that's that's the definition that Grock
will give you. But a number of you said,
Scott, you don't understand. In my
world, you said it means do violence,
you know, kill somebody. And I thought
to myself, what the hell world do you
live
in? Now, I will I will give you I will
give you that if you were in uh the back
room of a mafia
situation and the mafia boss said to
you, "Hey, Scott, I need you to 86
veto." That would mean kill him. Can we
all agree on that? that if the context
were a dangerous context, let's say you
were in the military and you were
talking to a sniper and you were giving
your sniper some instructions. All
right, we see these guys standing on
that on that wall over there, 86 of
them. So, I think we can all agree that
86 depends entirely on the context.
And if there's one thing I know, when
you want to get some violence and kill
somebody, the way you communicate it is
with
seashells. You organize them in
seashells on the beach. So that's how
you know it was really violence cuz the
seashells context context people. But I
guess uh Comey's already been talked to
by the Secret Service. Uh the smart
people say he's not going to be in any
trouble because uh he he already deleted
the post and said, "Oh, I didn't realize
that there's a a violent meaning to
that." Not
uh on restaurant shows. Not even Yeah.
Yeah. Is that a good argument that
Gordon Ramsay hasn't said 86 so
therefore it's not a restaurant thing?
It's literally the definition of it. go
to any
AI gro will help and just say what is
the definition of 86 and it will say it
came out of the restaurant industry now
but but I'm
acknowledging that if you were in a
different context where people do get
killed and that's normal for that
context that if you used it in that
context it probably would mean kill
somebody but no the normal context is
not kill somebody. It just seems to be a
secondary
context and I will acknowledge that
anyway. He's not in any risk. You won't
be arrested
because there's a nonviolent more common
use for it. As long as that's true, you
don't have to worry about it. He doesn't
have to worry about
it. Um, but I will give you this. I I I
do think the Republicans just want to
pounce on it because if if Trump had
said it, they would have said it's mafia
talk. Yeah, Trump's doing that mafia
talk. And we would say, are you kidding?
That's not mafia talk. It's just
talk. So if you want to go after Comey
and act like he was doing mafia
talk, have
fun. Just have fun with it. But don't
drag me into
it cuz to me that issue is
done. So the Supreme Court was looking
at that issue of whether
um it would be legal well no it wasn't
looking at that but it was considering
the Alien Enemies Act and birthright
citizenship and it made a ruling that
had nothing to do with either of them
directly. Um, so it kicked back, the
Supreme Court kicked back to a lower
court the question of how long you would
give notice to these alien enemies
before you pick them up and deport them.
Now, I'm no border security
person,
but is it a good idea to give notice to
your alien enemies before you pick them
up? And how much notice do you
give? Yeah, there you go. There's the
Grock definition going by in the
comments.
Um, and I I saw somebody suggest, all
right, well, if you have to give them 72
hours of notice or something like that,
can you do it all at once? Can you just
announce, hey, if you're in that trend
raw, you know, gang, uh, we're telling
you now publicly, it's your 72-hour
notice. You better get out of here now.
Maybe maybe you can do them all at once.
Or do you have to do them individually,
like with their name? Juan, I'm here to
tell you, you've got 72 hours. then
wouldn't one kind of disappear or can
you tell them after they're
captured? So, I don't know anything. I I
don't understand the story at all. So,
it's going to a lower court to decide
how much notice you get if you're if
you're a target of the Alien Enemies
Act. So, I think the Supreme Court,
somebody said, punted. Yeah, they they
just decided not to be part of the
solution.
Maybe that was the right answer. Well,
Moody's has downgraded the uh credit
rating of the US. Uh I think it's the
last one that did it because the other
credit agencies have already done it.
And it's because of our
debt. Too much debt. And then they
looked at the new budget proposal and
said to themselves, well, that's not
going to help. So there you go.
That should cost us a lot of money for
nothing. Over in Gaza,
um there's a question about whether
Israel succeeded in taking out the head
of Hamas, which his last name would be
Sinoir. Now, you might say, "But wait,
they already took out Sinoir." Well,
apparently he had a brother. And so
Sidoir's
brother was the head of Hamas and they
they bombed
something that they believe he was in,
but they say it's going to take a while
to know if they actually got him. I
don't know why that would take a while
because it seems like if they didn't get
him, wouldn't the Hamas want to brag
about it? Ah, you missed. I don't know.
But I guess the uh Israelis are doing
what they're calling Operation Gideon's
chariots. Um it involves a lot of
bulldozers and tanks and stuff and
they're going to push deep into
Gaza and uh backed by heavy
artillery and they're going to occupy
the entire strip and rescue the
remaining hostages. Well, I don't know
how much rescuing they're going to do,
but they're gonna basically occupy the
whole thing. Now, I've got a
question. I've seen lots of pictures of
Gaza since the war started. Have you
seen any pictures of anything in Gaza
that look like a habitable home? Because
I haven't. Haven't they destroyed 100%
of the habitable homes?
So, what did where did the uh
non-combatants
go? I mean, I I assume that was, you
know, the plan to make sure that they
didn't have any incentive to stay. Um,
but I've never seen a single image in
Gaza since, you know, recently. Anyway,
uh, where there was a home that could be
occupied by a real
person. I explained the 86, but what
about the 47?
That's That's President Trump, 47th
president. Teemo
Sinoir. That's always funny seeing in
the comments. He He's not the original
Sinoir. He's Teemo Senoir. Anyway, it
looks to me like uh Trump is staying out
of the Gaza situation. U giving himself
a little distance because nothing good
is going to come out of that
reputationally.
Um, you know, Israel is pursuing what
they see as in their national best
interests. They might be right about
that, but you don't want to get tired by
that same brush. You know, you you don't
want to look like you're
helping because there's nothing good for
our country that's going to come out of
that. Um, except, you know, bad
reputation for being in favor of that
much war. So, I think Trump is still
saying something like, "Stop fighting,
end the war." But I don't know how much
he means it because Israel is not has no
intention whatsoever of ending the war
until they've gotten everything they
want. And uh they probably
will. Well, remember I told you there
was some advisor in
Iran who had claimed that Iran was ready
to deal and they, you know, they would,
you know, maybe uh limit their uranium
enrichment
uh in return for the dropping of the
sanctions. And I was mocking that a
little bit because he wasn't an elected
official and it just seemed like just
some guy talking. Well, Iran says that
that uh basically nothing's going on in
terms of uh
negotiating. So that wasn't real
uh at least in terms of the leadership.
So that there was no there was no any
kind of
anything. So um Trump has said that that
they've sent a proposal over to Iran.
Iran's uh leader says there's no
proposal from the
US. We there's nothing. We don't have
anything. We don't have anything written
down. So everything that we're hearing
about the negotiating in Iran,
apparently it's all fake. Uh whatever
Trump is saying about ongoing
negotiations, nope. Nothing like that
happening according to Iran. So, I don't
know if that means that there are secret
negotiations, but it kind of looks like
there are no
negotiations and we're not even close.
And uh there's not really much chance
that that's going to turn into a peace
deal anytime soon. So, I wouldn't think
that Iran is going to be some big
victory for Trump anytime soon.
Uh and then according to the Hill
um at least one expert on Russia and
Eurasia said it's clear that most
observers that Putin is not interested
in serious negotiations or a ceasefire
according to
Maria. She's some kind of expert in that
area.
Um, and then some people say that if
Trump were to meet with Putin privately,
which Trump is suggesting he'd like to
do, that it would not not produce any
kind of a peace deal, but it would raise
Putin's profile. So, it'd be good for
Putin to meet with Trump, but there's no
way it's going to turn into a peace deal
because Putin seems to have no interest
in that whatsoever. I would agree and
I've been saying it for some time that
Putin is clearly
signaling that he doesn't want a peace
deal. He just wants to keep doing what
he's doing. So I wouldn't expect any
kind of Ukraine peace
deal. Um but Emanuel Mcronone says that
Europe is putting together some new
package of Russia sanctions coordinating
with the United States. zero hedges
reporting this and um we'll see if
there's if if that makes any difference.
Do do you think there are enough
sanctions left that we haven't already
done that are going to bring Putin to
his knees? It doesn't feel like
it. Like what what exactly are they
going to do? Are they going to say well
Europe is going to have no energy this
winter?
I mean, I think Europe kind of has to
buy from them because it's not like they
have another source that would give them
the volume that they need. So, I don't
expect anything to happen in
Ukraine, anything positive to
happen. Well, according to interesting
engineer engineering, China is using
their AI deepseek
um to make decisions in the battle. you
know, during a battle 3,600 times faster
than
humans. Does that scare you
yet? Imagine going into a
battle where there, you know, robots and
drones and whatnot, a lot of automation
and it's being completely run by the AI
and the AI is making instant decisions
that humans can't keep up with. That's
some dangerous stuff, but that's what's
coming. And I'm sure the United States
has to match that. You know, even if we
thought, oh no, it's too dangerous for
the machines for the machines to be
making
decisions. Um, I think we'd just have to
because if our adversaries are using AI
to make
instant multiple decisions, we're going
to have to have that capability even if
we think it's dangerous. So, there's
that. All right.
So, I think I may have mentioned or did
I that I'm really really tired and uh
trying not to hallucinate. So, I'm going
to end it here. Um I'll remind you again
that usually on Saturday Owen Gregorian
does a spaces after this show, but that
will be Sunday this week. So, it'll be
