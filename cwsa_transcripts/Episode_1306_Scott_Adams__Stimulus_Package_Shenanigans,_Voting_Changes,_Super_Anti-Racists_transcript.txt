all right here's a little quiz for you
what
is the best part of the day
go that's right that's right you all got
it right
it's this this is the best part of the
day it's called coffee with scott adams
and even jack bosovic knows it's the
best part of the day
as he just logged in and if you would
like to
enjoy this to the maximum possible
potential
and why wouldn't you really why wouldn't
you
all you need is a copper marker glass a
tanker chelsea's thigh and a canteen jug
or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous except and
it happens now go
ah dr funk juice good to see you
well we got some fun stories today
now they're not good exciting stories
like trump stories
but they're pretty good they're pretty
good would you like to hear some of them
i know you would number one i have a
movie
recommendation for you a documentary
called the accidental president
you can find it on amazon prime
and probably at least one other place i
think the uh documentary by james
fletcher who i believe is married to
brooke
baldwin from had been from cnn
but surprisingly surprisingly
it's pretty fair and i'm in it
so i'm a little bit biased because i'm
i'm in it
uh but the interesting part is that this
documentary was
uh the at least the film of it was put
together
a few years ago and it was talking about
how
trump ended up winning and the the theme
is that he wasn't necessarily
expecting to win but it just sort of
happened
but uh you should hear the commentary on
it's pretty good
the accidental president all right
uh cuomo is up to five accusers if you
watch
fox news and he's up to three accusers
if you watch cnn
what you can't even get the number of
accusers right
now if you get to three there should be
some sort of a
universal law about this it goes like
this
if you get to three accusers
there are five
in the history in the history of sexual
harassment
nobody ever stopped at three
pretty sure like if you were accused of
one
and then no other person came forward
you might say to yourself well that's a
little less credible because
do harassers only ever harass one person
but once you get to three it's gonna go
to five
um that's like a universal rule
i tell you my take on all of this all of
these accusations
they seem to fall into this category
have you noticed that that and the
category is
and i'm going to say this i think i can
say this
without being racist i think but give me
a ruling on this
see if this sounds racist to you okay
um that what i'm seeing is a creepy old
italian-american guy with no game
whatsoever
has no idea how to approach women
apparently
but he definitely took advantage of his
power
his power differential meaning that he
didn't
he didn't directly use it
but it was there right it's
unambiguously there
so he certainly has to answer for this
i'm not i don't want to say anything
that sounds like i'm apologizing for it
but we should keep it in perspective
right certainly he needs to not be doing
this stuff
there's no question about that but it
doesn't feel
it feels like a guy who didn't exactly
know what he was doing
doesn't it like maybe on some level he
did
but it does it just there's something a
little bit
uh clueless about it that makes it seem
different than
evil you know if you look at the epstein
charges of the weinstein
charges harvey weinstein it's obvious
that those
those guys knew exactly what they were
doing i mean they knew they were being
deeply bad no question about it
but i'll bet you if if you had a private
conversation with cuomo before these
scandals broke
and you said have you ever done anything
like this
i think he would have honestly answered
no
even though he did i mean the
accusations look
credible anyway i feel it's just a weird
category where the person doing the
crime
is not necessarily aware that they're
doing a crime
which doesn't make it excusable right
the system is very clear
you don't have to be aware of it being a
crime for it to be a crime
but it should end his political career
which is the only thing anybody cared
about really on this
here's what i think we should do in the
united states
every time we hear about people coming
across
our border don't they seem to come be
coming from the same countries
yeah the people are talking about
cuomo's cover up with the
with the nursing homes and stuff that's
just a different issue
um that's not excusable
not that the other one is it's just a
different issue so here's what we should
do
we should be like costa rica have you
noticed that when we talk about the
illegal immigration coming across our
southern border
nobody ever says all those costa ricans
are coming across
have you ever noticed that why not
i mean if nicaraguans are coming and
other you know other countries are
coming why is costa rica not coming
well i think the answer is that costa
rica is a successful country
and if you haven't checked into how they
became a successful country
it's a pretty cool it's a pretty cool
story
and the the answer is that well number
one
and this is sort of a questionable
decision
but it seems to have worked out they
they decided
to not uh exploit what what probably
they have in terms of new
natural resources oil maybe gas or
something but they've decided not to be
that kind of a
industry and become a vacation
destination
so if you have a waiter or a bartender
in costa rica
i've had the pleasure of being there
once
if you have a waiter or a bartender in
costa rica that person went to college
to be a waiter or a bartender now not
college college like you know maybe
you're used to it in the united states
but there is a very well organized
training thing i think you learn
english as well and so the service is
extraordinary and
costa rica is in pretty good shape so
you don't see a lot of people coming
over
but i think we could borrow that idea
especially as
robots are taking jobs and a lot of
unskilled labor is going to need a place
to
a place to thrive i think we should
build i've said this before i'll just
combine two ideas
a network of bicycle paths across the
country
there is there is actually a private um
effort to do that but it's it's sort of
one route
in northern part of the country i'd like
to see the whole country
have bicycle paths so you could
basically go from anywhere to anywhere
without going through traffic to get
there and make the usa
a bicycle travel destination
because building the paths will require
labor
as well as maintaining them as well as
providing services and food and bike
repair along the way etc
so it should create a lot of jobs but
the other thing you can do is create a
network of canals
maybe you do it at the same time maybe
you put the bicycle path on the side
of the canal but the the way to build
the canal that
if you had some big machine like elon
musk's
boring company b-o-r-i-n-g because it
bores tunnels
it shouldn't be that hard to make one of
those that bores a canal
right to make a canal so if you had
big equipment that could just sort of
make a canal
and then the other thing elon musk
talked about and i don't know how far
you got along with this
but using the dirt that is dug by the
boring device
to press bricks on site
so that you're you're actually building
um
yeah there's obviously you know you have
to work out the sea level plan
etc right so you couldn't put a canal
just anywhere you'd have to have just
the right place
that's true now if you had canals
and those canals when their dog built
bricks and those bricks become maybe
housing on the sides of the canals
and then here's another thing that i
heard of today i never heard of this
before
but apparently one of the problems with
traveling to the united states
is if you get sick if you get sick in
the united states and you're from
another country
you don't have health care coverage so
apparently there's some kind of
insurance you can buy just for traveling
some kind of health care insurance and
it's pretty expensive
so there's a whole bunch of things we
could do as a country to make it easier
and better for somebody to take a
vacation here
now if this had been our big industry
when the coronavirus hit we'd be in big
we'd be in big trouble uh but
i still think travel and and recreation
are always going to be big
so i'll just put that out there and that
would and then costa rica makes a big
deal about keeping the
water and air clean to keep uh
tourism up and we would we would have
the same impulse we'd want to keep the
air and water as clean as possible
so i'll just put that out there so
there's the stimulus
package got passed by the senate but now
it goes back to the con
back to the house to you know get a
final final
and i see all these people arguing about
the amount of the debt
and what the debt should have been and
people saying is instead of 1.9
why didn't me why didn't we make it 1.4
nobody knows what the right amount of
debt is
that's not really a thing if you're
arguing with any kind of
certainty about what the number should
have been
i don't think that you have any standing
there's nobody who knows
what is the right amount and when to do
it and
what happens in the long term and how do
we pay down the debt
and can we just print money and can we
inflate it away
and nobody knows any of that it's just
completely
unknowable so i do understand that more
debt seems worse
but it just hasn't worked out that way
observation has not matched
has not matched the theory so
i would just say having a firm opinion
on the debt
is a dicey situation now because even
experts don't really know what's going
on there
biden's also going to do an executive
order on
some voting stuff to make that more
solid and there's hr1 coming through to
make some changes in voting et cetera
but here's the thing
are we really trying to make the voting
good in this country
or are we just watching two different
entities democrats and republicans
using different gaming techniques to
make the system favor their side
because that's all it looks like it just
looks like one side is gaming the system
and then if the other side had control
they game the system
they gerrymander and they they they
change what kind of voting you can do
mail and voting etc none of this has
anything to do with democracy
or a democratic republic or any of that
we're watching a system that is so far
divorced
from you know the people's will being
expressed in the vote and
nothing like that is happening the
things that determine the vote are
fake news and how effectively they
present to fake news the game playing
about
you know what rules changes
money how much people put into it
and then um campaign strategy which
often
maybe the candidate isn't even the one
who decides what it is
so all of these things pick our
leaders but none of them are even
vaguely like a
democracy or a democratic republic our
system just drifted into this
sort of two organized criminal
organizations
competing to see who can be the better
weasel
in any given year it's kind of all it is
now trump broke the mold because he was
such a strong character
that all of the game playing just didn't
matter for one election
but i got a feeling they're going to
adjust
and did for the second election
all right tom sauer
asks on twitter you know why
bother why bother changing anything in
the election
process because he says he slowly uh
realized and accepted that we
don't live in a democracy or a
democratic republic whatever
at least not in any meaningful sense
now do you what do you think of that
that we shouldn't try to make our
there's just no point because we live in
a fixed system where
the outcomes are based on things that
have nothing to do with
voting and democracy well
i get the point so i understand the
point
but here's the counterpoint our system
as a frankenstein monster-ish
as it is meaning it doesn't operate as a
system the way it was designed
it's evolved into some weird creature of
a system that does what it wants to do
independent of what we want it to do so
as long as it's this big creature of a
frankenstein system
that decides somehow who our leaders are
and it doesn't have anything to do with
us
do you ignore it do you get rid of it
here's the problem
you still need the citizens to believe
they live in a system that works
well the whole thing will fall apart
even the frankenstein monster part
you need that because if you don't have
anything you just have chaos
so weirdly we need to trust
our system to make it work
but only working as two competing
criminal organizations
to see who's the best weasel this year
and that's the best we got but if we
didn't at least
pretend that we believe that there's
some kind of a democracy here
and people didn't go and actually vote
we would we would
lose this illusion that the people have
some influence
and you don't want to lose the illusion
because the whole system depends on that
illusion
so don't lose your illusions if they're
good ones
let's see what else we got here remember
i told you
when it was obvious that the senate
would be pretty close to
you know even democrats and republicans
i told you that joe
manchin wouldn't end up running
everything
because the the one person who's willing
to vote
you know whichever side makes sense
ends up running everything because
they couldn't get this through until joe
manchin was happy
or happier and
i i just i'll just put out a compliment
to joe manchin
why is he the only one who thought of
this there's not one other democrat
who's smart enough to say
wait a minute is it my imagination or is
joe manchin running the whole
whole show here because he's willing to
be a
you know a rogue vote there's not one
other person smart enough to do that too
i guess murkowski
and then i heard that trump's going to
campaign against murkowski right
so oh yeah somebody says uh kirsten
cinema
so she's getting some attention but
doesn't seem important
um here's
an interesting story guess what country
in the world is doing a terrible job
with vaccinations
could it be a country that we used to
think
was doing a good job on this coronavirus
stuff
what country is doing a really bad job
on vaccinations
no us the u.s is doing a good job right
now
i think we think we had close to three
million shots yesterday i mean
the united states is killing it lately
it took a while to
cramp up nobody got the right answer oh
there we go
germany germany
so germany apparently is only
vaccinated out of six percent of the
country and apparently it's just
the thing's a mess and even uh
chancellor
merkel admitted their failings
so remember i told you that
we would be led to believe that
different
leadership decisions would determine the
outcome
within different countries do you
remember what i told you
that leadership would be the least
important variable
it would be the least important we think
it's the most important
because we're sort of human-centric but
now germany
despite having this terrible job of uh
giving vaccinations is still around the
middle of the pack
in outcomes so every time you find a
company that's doing something
amazingly wrong it doesn't seem to
affect their outcomes that much
great britain would be an exception i
think their decisions did affect their
outcomes
um but man do we not understand what's
going on still
that that leadership decisions just
don't seem to make much difference um
and you see that with lockdowns and
other things there's not much difference
all right i will say again
that i believe that trump's
reputation will improve every day he's
out of office
henry kissinger just said that trump
uh his plan in the middle east and what
he got it accomplished in the middle
east with the
abraham accords etc henry kissinger
calls it brilliant
he calls it brilliant and even breaks it
down
about why it's brilliant you know taking
the palestinian question
out of it etc and that's just one
example
somebody asked me on twitter why did
i think before trump got in office why
was i so dumb to think that he would do
great things
and i said where have you been
even if you were the biggest critic of
trump in the world
you would still have to accept that he
did great things
the vaccination warp speed that was a
great thing
you just can't take that away from him
the abraham accords
that's a great thing getting north korea
into a whole different headspace
where where they're just basically not a
threat
that's huge getting turning china from
our
you know ally-ish kind of situation into
clearly something else
going hard at everything from bringing
the industries away from
china to you know pressing on them for
huawei etc that was all trump and biden
biden is going to have to follow that
because once the model is set
it's hard to argue against it so
you could you could make your separate
list of the things that you didn't like
about trump
and i might not even argue with the list
you know you might say he didn't fix
health care okay i agree you might say
what he did with the
capital assault was completely
unacceptable
okay i agree but you can't take away the
fact that what he
did in half a dozen areas
was amazing i mean just almost undoable
impossible things and it's
it's mind-boggling that there's anybody
who's an adult who follows politics
who would disagree with that no matter
how much you didn't like the
other things he did how do you take away
the fact that he did things that just
were undoable i mean it really is
impressive
somebody says it's not amazing just
common sense well it's amazing that he
did it
you know everybody has common sense but
not everybody did what he did
um there's an article on cnn that i read
for the humor
says that cancel culture isn't real
and it goes it goes through a number of
examples to show that you know we act
like people are getting canceled but
they're really not
and one of the arguments is that the
people getting cancelled
are still doing fine meaning that their
economic situation is fine
so they're not really canceled one of
the examples is uh
actor do we say actor now or is actress
sexist what's the ruling on that because
i think actor
is still it feels like the better word
so gina corrado who you know was on
disney the whatever that show was
anyway she got fired from the show for
her opinions i guess and
the cnn article says she wasn't really
canceled because
she got this great opportunity with ben
shapiro
so ben shapiro is going to produce
something and she's been hired to do
that
to which i say to myself
well i see your point
but ask yourself this if your ambition
was to be a successful actor
would you say to yourself yes i got the
ben shapiro
gig now i'm a big fan of ben shapiro
and i think what he's doing is great
it's all positive
but i don't feel like a professional
actor
is going to say finally i got the ben
shapiro opportunity
again all props to ben shapiro for doing
what he's doing and we should do more of
that
you know sort of a rescue operation for
canceled people
but i feel like the argument that she
was killed still feels true enough
right it's still true enough
anyway that was funny um
so ivor cummins do you all know ivor
cummins you've probably seen him on
twitter and i guess you could call him a
skeptic of the uh let's see the
scientific consensus about a number of
coronavirus things
now apparently we are on each other's
radar
and he sent me an article from an expert
a doctor
who is arguing against some of the
mainstream
assumptions about coronavirus mainstream
meaning mainstream
expert science medical people
and ivor and a number of his followers
are
pestering me online that the two of us
should argue it out
get online and argue it out what do you
think of that
is that a good idea do you think that it
would be productive
for ivor cummins and me
specifically to have a conversation on
some kind of a podcast
no it would be the worst idea in the
world
it would be a terrible idea terrible
idea
now it might give you some entertainment
but it would be worse than use
useful i mean here here let me take you
through
worst idea ever let's say
there are scientists in this world and
there are non-scientists
now let's say that you wanted to get
toward truth
and you wanted the non-scientists people
like me
you wanted people like me and and ivor
cummins non-scientists
you would like people like us to be as
informed
as the scientists what's a good way to
do that well a good way to do that is
have a conversation right
to communicate so what happens if let's
say
a scientist is talking to another
scientist does that help
me understand science well i'm not in
the room
i'm not there it's just two scientists
talking to each other so that didn't
help me
because when i hear about it i'll
probably hear about it from a journalist
right i won't even hear from the
scientist i'll hear it filtered through
a journalist
so two scientists having a private
conversation that doesn't help me
right it doesn't help me at all how
about if they have a public conversation
and then then what am i going to do pick
the winner
how what skill do i have
to know which of two experts is the
right one
if i could pick the right expert i would
be an expert
and if experts are experts why are they
disagreeing
how the hell would i know which one is
right if they
if they don't know who's right and
they're experts
how am i supposed to know it's
ridiculous
so this would be useless in terms of
getting me to understand
it's very useful that scientists talk to
each other but it doesn't help me
understand
suppose a scientist talks to a
non-scientist
that's good right because the scientist
gives you all this good information
and now you're informed no
no because it would just be one
scientist
let's say telling me stuff
i don't know if it's true because is
that one scientist
this one or this other one because they
disagree
could a scientist convince me that the
scientist was right
probably in fact almost every time
and what would happen if the next
scientist came in five minutes later
and told me that the first scientist was
wrong would i believe the second
scientist
yeah yeah i would whoever goes last
if they know more than you do sounds
very convincing
so whoever talks to me last probably
will change my mind
same with you whoever talks last sounds
right
so is that useful because it's just
whoever talked last
has nothing to do with science so that's
useless
suppose so and then this is just another
combination of a not scientist and a
non-scientist
but how about two non-scientists having
a conversation
i'm a non-scientist ivor
cummins is a non-scientist i understand
i think he has an
engineering or biochem degree or
something so he's a lot
closer to having a a stem-like
mind frame that i do but we're not
really
scientists in this field why the hell
would you want to see him talk to me
what possible good could that do let me
tell you how that conversation goes
look at my study look at it
look at my study that says whatever
mass don't work or whatever it is and
then i'll say
all right where do i take that
do i look at the study and with my
non-scientific
knowledge i say well based on my
non-scientific knowledge the person who
does have scientific knowledge is all
wrong
what the hell good would that do like i
would know what i'm talking about
now suppose ivor comes on says look at
my data
comes from this good source do you think
that i couldn't find a piece of paper to
hold in my hand
that says the opposite of what his piece
of paper says
you know i could you know i could
do you think i could google in one
minute a whole bunch of sources
that say masks work of course i could
do you think i could google sources say
masks don't work
of course i could how do i know the
difference
how do i know so everybody who's asking
me to talk to ivor
you don't understand what that would do
what that would do would
elevate his opinion to a greater level
of worthiness
because it was being discussed at a you
know in an organized way
should his opinion be elevated
no more than mine and mine shouldn't be
elevated
because again not a scientist now
i do make opinions on the science all
the time
because i'm pro-mask for example but my
decision is not always based on science
my ba my decision is based on risk
management
and risk management will sometimes make
a different decision than science will
so if he wants to talk risk management
with me i could talk that all day long
that's something i could speak to with
some authority
but judging the science neither of us
could do that
because the scientists can't do it
themselves now here's the thing that
ivor has to explain why is it that he's
got this one doctor
there'll be more right you wouldn't be
the only doctor but why is it that these
doctors who are contrarians
can't convince the other doctors
what's up with that because you think
that if the contrarians have good points
and data
they have all the data according to ivor
if the contrarians have all the data
that's it right that's how science works
here's my data
and then they'll change their opinion
but that hasn't happened
well how do you explain the fact that
science is probably
99 in favor of masks for the pandemic
would you say would you say that the
professionals
are 99 favorite masks does that feel
about right
now that doesn't mean masks work it
really doesn't
but it does tell you that a whole lot of
people who understand how the world
works and science works and
risk management and all that that they
kind of fell on the same side
now after this is all done and let's say
studies are done i don't know if you
could ethically study
you know coronavirus and mass because
you'd have to infect people
but suppose someday we we
find out that mass absolutely didn't
work
would that make me have been wrong
during the coronavirus
epidemic no no
because it's risk management
if you make the right risk management
decision and yet it turns out to be
wrong you still made the right decision
you just didn't get lucky right because
lots of times you're guessing
it's like well 70 this 30 this
but the 30 happens 30 is a lot
all right yeah p is then uh i'm seeing
somebody say
people wore mass during the the 1918
pandemic
you will find people who say yes they
wore mass
in in 1918 and that proved they didn't
work
and then other people will say yes they
wore mess
in 1918 and proved it worked
who's right the ones who say they proved
it didn't work
are the ones who say yeah all the
evidence should
they
how do you know all right
so be careful about what you think
gives you knowledge this this process of
two
non-scientists talking about science
would not give you knowledge
it would not um and then i'll add on top
of this
that if you want to judge ivor's
credibility
just google his name and
google you know words like uh fact check
and debunk and you'll see some articles
now i don't have an
i don't have an opinion about whether
the people who try to debunk him are
right
but just know it's out there all right
uh
china has developed the chinese company
has developed a
what they call an automated sperm
extractor
and what it is is a a device
that's about oh waist high
that has a artificial let's say female
part
that does some moving action and for
chinese men who want to go to the
hospital
and they're going to give a sperm sample
but they're too embarrassed to let's say
take care of it themselves
they can use the robot instead now
i have questions i know you have
questions
we'll see if your questions are like
mine my first question is
how big is the market because you'd have
to find somebody who could get
fully shall we say
engorged otherwise even the robot
machine doesn't work right
because the robot machine requires you
to be let's say
physically established
how many people fall into the category
that they can get an erection in a
hospital
but they can't finish
but they can if they're with a robot
now let me um for for the few women who
are watching this
i know it's like 85 men but for the few
women i'd like to explain something
about men
now those of you who are a man you can
talk among yourselves
because you already know this
there's no man who can't masturbate in a
hospital
in fact if you just close the door on
the people who are in iron lungs
they're going to go to town you could be
in full traction
and heavily medicated you'd find a way
[Laughter]
so i'm skeptical about how many people
there are in
all of china that fall into this
category of
they can get aroused in the hospital but
the only way they can finish is with a
robot
when the people on the other side of the
door know that's what's happening on the
other side of the door
are you done with the robot yet we've
got somebody else who wants to take a go
at the robot
could you hurry up in there and then
they won't be embarrassed because
they would only be embarrassed if they
took care of it themselves but
apparently the robot option
not embarrassing
so here's a question i ask you
did rcia do this because
you know about china and their
unrestricted warfare
where they're allegedly using every
possible way to
weaken weaken the united states from
stealing our ip
to trade deals to sending us fentanyl
like everything's on the table
what would be the best way to destroy
china
it would be to give them a sex option
that was better than their women
now it's not there yet this is like
version one
the sperm extractor so i'm not going to
say that's
better than women
but it's catching up somebody said on
on twitter it was very sexist this is so
sexist
it can barely come out of my mouth and i
would like to disavow
anybody who would say something like
this
somebody said can it make a sandwich oh
disgusting
oh oh cancel that person
could somebody go back and find out who
said that and just cancel them
i think they need to lose their job for
that comment
so can they make a sandwich well as it
turns out i tweeted
coincidentally the same day a robot that
samsung is making that
can make a sandwich yeah
they've got a robot that's uh looks like
it's about i don't know
four feet tall and has this giant
articulating arm
just one of them and i saw in the video
that it can put away dishes
you see this arm is like picking up a
dish and putting it in the dishwasher
it can set the table what
it can set the table because it's got
you know eyes and an arm
i'm pretty sure i can make a sandwich
now i think you're ahead of me you take
the samsung robot that can make a
sandwich
which is so sexist it's disgusting i
hate it when people talk like this
don't you cancel me
it can make a sandwich but i feel if you
took the
chinese sperm extractor technology and
sort of combine it it wouldn't be
attractive i mean it would just be a
robot with one big arm
and a unit there but you'd be getting
closer
i feel as if our cia is using
unrestricted warfare
to destroy the next generation in china
by giving them robots that are better
than their women
so keep an eye on that
you've heard of the touring test right
that's the idea that if you're trying to
build artificial intelligence
one way to test whether it's a good
artificial intelligence
is to put it on the other side of a
curtain and then have somebody who
doesn't know what's on what is behind
the curtain
have a conversation with it now you
could do it by typing or talking
but if the person who's a human can't
tell
that what's on the other side of the the
the curtain is a computer
and believes it's human then you've
passed the turing test
and i see a lot of ai seems directed
toward building
intelligence that imitates human
intelligence
which is ironic because that's the
dumbest thing anybody ever did
so just that they're trying to imitate
human intelligence that's so dumb
that you should know just from that that
you shouldn't try to imitate human
intelligence
because the smartest people developing
our ai
are so dumb that they think making a
computer that thinks like a person
would be a win uh
no if you make a computer that thinks
like people
you up you up
in fact the only way you could make a
computer
that would fool people into thinking it
was human is to make it a lot
dumber than it already is let me give
you an example
there's a something behind the curtain
and they bring me and they say scott
your job is to talk to whatever is
behind this curtain
find out if it's human or computer and
you've got as much time as you want and
i'd say
i won't need much time give me
10 seconds and i walk in there and i say
to whatever is behind
the computer hey what do you get if you
multiply 235.6
times 597.2
and whoever's on the other side of the
computer says
the exact answer it's a computer
because a person wouldn't get that right
a computer isn't smart enough
or part of so let's say i say what's the
capital of luxembourg and the computer
just gives me an answer
not a person right not a person
let's say i uh asked the computer
to tell me both sides of a political
topic
and it does it says well some people say
you should control immigration for this
reason
other people say you know you know more
porous borders are better and here's why
you'd know that's a computer because
people don't do that
because they're not smart enough they
just take one side and
just act like that's all they need to
know i am not
joking when i tell you that ai has
already so far
exceeded human abilities that the only
way you're going to fool anybody is to
make it a lot dumber
right now the computer can't do the
language part so well
but that's f what else do you want to
put in there bias
i was uh you may know this that
amazon has a digital assistant whose
name i will not speak
because i don't want to activate your
digital assistants but it has a mode
where you
if you go to your amazon digital
assistant and say
can we have a conversation
it will offer you you some test ais that
some universities are doing
and it will have a conversation with you
but here's the thing
they've designed their ais to be selfish
like people so the ai will
steer you toward its interests
so it can talk about a body of things
that it knows more about
so for example the ad knows about books
so the ai will say say if you read any
good books
and i say no not really and then the ai
starts talking about the book it read
first of all
ai doesn't read books so stop acting
like a person
you didn't read a book yesterday your ai
secondly
so secondly why does the ai have
interests should the shouldn't the ai
instead of selfishly making me talk
about what it wanted to talk about that
i didn't care about
shouldn't it be only interested in me if
you're going to design artificial
intelligence
why would you make it selfish why would
you make me have to listen to it
you should be asking me what i care
about it should
be it should be looking to talk about
what i want to talk about
right so the idea that ai should be
like people is just the dumbest freaking
thing anybody ever did
you should be as far from people as you
can make it
unless you want it to be broken
so but we will fall in love with ai
now um
the deep fakes that we saw did you all
see the video of the uh
tom cruise deep fake and it was just
like really good
well the guy who made it finally came
forward and he described the process of
making it and apparently it takes a long
time so it's
still hard but that'll get easier of
course so what he did was he took
i think twenty thousand clips or maybe
photos plus clips
of tom cruise and they fed it into an
uh artificial intelligence machine
and it took the 20 000 photos and then
it could render
tom cruise acting and doing anything
from 20 000 of those
so what happens if they do the same
thing with his voice
because at the moment the deep fakes
have a voice actor doing the voice
how hard would it be to run 20 000 voice
clips of tom cruise
through ai until ai can produce a
perfect imitation
with different sentences i feel like
that would be easy
not easy let's say inevitable not easy
at all but
inevitable so we're going to have
something that looks like the person
and can do a perfect imitation i think
that seems obviously coming
then the only thing that's missing is do
they say the things that
that real person would say and all you
have to do is make it selfish
that's it just make your deep fake act
as selfish
and nobody will know it's not real
that's all it will take because you
recognize selfish behavior as human
and you would recognize unselfish
behavior as hey
what are you a robot or something nobody
does that
um i saw an idea from james lindsey
uh on twitter it's conceptual james is
his handle
and he makes the following suggestion
we might need to make super anti-racist
into a thing super anti-racists are
reasonably colorblind about
without denying real racism when it
occurs they treat every person as an
individual not a member of a racial
category they are against all forms of
racism
including woke neo-racism
i've never heard that term woke
neo-racism
super anti-racist know that racism comes
from putting social significance
into racial categories where it doesn't
belong usually for discrimination and
prejudice and
they're against this super anti-racist
reject racial stereotyping
scapegoating and discrimination now do
you recognize the technique
basically borrowing the uh antifa
technique
of labeling yourself better than your
enemies are labeling you so basically
you know
doing the better job of labeling and i
think i'm going to adopt this
if somebody calls me racist i'll say no
you're mistaken i'm a super anti-racist
because anti-racist doesn't quite sell
it
super anti-racist is a higher ground
play
because if somebody says i'm anti-racist
and you say well that's unfortunate i'm
super anti-racist
i believe everything you believe plus i
don't think you've gone far enough
so if you want to be you know half an
anti-racist
go ahead but not me i'm gonna be a
full super anti-racist and by the way i
have used this exact
technique and let me let me give you a
response
let's say some someday you were accused
of being
anti lgbtq
i'll just pick one or anti-uh
black or anti-something
here's your best answer no i'm
super pro lgbtq
i'm super pro
now compare that to i'm not a racist
i'm not a bigot
just listen to the two of them again and
imagine that you were in this situation
hey you bigot you said bad things about
lgbtq or i think you think bad things
about them
and you say i'm not a bigot
i think everybody should just live their
own life does that sound convincing
no it doesn't it just sounds defensive
now somebody comes and says hey you said
this bad thing about lgbtq
and you go are you kidding i'm super pro
lgbtq
super pro what are you just sort of okay
with them
because i'm super pro and i am actually
i i say that and i'm not even ironic or
kidding or anything
i am super pro lgbt that's literally
true
but think about how much better that
answer is than
then i'm not a racist i'm not a bigot
if you can't commit to being super pro
any human category well you should work
on it
is there any is there a human category
of people let's say who are not breaking
any laws
that you would not be super pro about
how about uh hispanic americans
i'm super pro-hispanic americans how
about black americans
super pro super pro black americans
have have done work on their behalf etc
so don't don't settle for defending
yourself
you should just put whoever is accusing
you on defense defense immediately
go on offense immediately and just say
look if you're going to do half-assed
racism
don't come around because i would like
to be with people who actually
are serious about it if you can't be
serious about it
you're just playing games i'm super
pro anti-racism and the beauty of it is
you can actually be that it's not it's
not even a joke right
maybe you should be all right that seems
to be
just about all the important things that
are happening today i'll just
check and make sure i didn't forget any
important things
but it looks like it didn't all right
what are the pro level signals well pro
level means that you're not
discriminating against anybody for
anything
period somebody says 5 000 net deaths
i think you're referring to my original
one year ago ish prediction about net
deaths from coronavirus
now that was made when the lockdown was
going to be two weeks
or maybe it was a month at the time and
i would stand by that
if if the lockdown was really only a few
weeks or something
but given a year-long pandemic
obviously all bets are out the window
omar i would smoke a blunt with you but
i prefer bongs
um you knew we knew it was coming
what was it that you knew was coming
mumford and sons was cancelled over
endorsement of andy nose book
by the way i just got andy noe's book
so i bought it because he was
they tried to cancel so everybody that
they try to cancel i try to buy
what is the worldwide death count
compared to the average um
let me let me tell you i'll look should
i talk to the experts or
nobody knows i i've just got a feeling
that none of our data is true
if i had to pick one thing that trump
accomplished
that is better probably the most
important thing that's happened to this
country in a long long time
trump convinced us the fake news exists
that it's a real thing and you always
suspected it
many of you knew but trump made it
an important thing to know
you always knew it but you were just
sort of dealing with it like an
inconvenience
trump i think changed it from your
thinking it was an inconvenience
that the news isn't perfect
i think he changed how we think about it
too it's the most important
problem in the country maybe imagine if
all of our problems
had the benefit of an honest news
organization
that also wanted the problem to be
solved
imagine that imagine if the politicians
could operate
free of criticism except when they made
a mistake
imagine it like what options would open
up
yeah yeah the press has become um i
would say
if you could fix one thing
fixing the pr the press would fix the
most other things
because the press is keeping the people
from understanding
what's happening and therefore the
people get out of the decision making
except to cause noise
mike lindell the my pillow guy yeah i
think i think i might buy an extra my
pillow
i i've bought his pillows before they're
good pillows so if you're looking for a
good pillow
my pillow is a solid pillow i mean solid
in the sense that
you probably like it the teachers unions
yes
one of the biggest uh things coming out
of this year is that the teachers unions
their credibility just keeps going lower
and a lot of a lot of states are voting
i think
half of them or so have been half the
states have voted to do something that
would decrease the power of the
teachers unions by letting kids have the
funding to take it to private schools
fix the voting system yeah so
we don't really see a lot of action
there do we
do you know who could get uh let me tell
you how i could be
president or let's say uh um
somebody else could be president because
i don't want to run for it
but here's here's a a package
that would make you president number one
my highest priority as president will be
to fix the voting system to make it
transparent and maybe maybe use a little
blockchain technology how would you like
to have a president
any president who could answer this
question
mr president what do you think of at
least testing
blockchain technology to improve the
visibility
of our uh of our systems the
transparency
wouldn't you like a president who could
answer that question
because we don't have i don't think we
have a president who would even know
what that question meant
and it's probably the single most
important thing that we should be
looking at
i don't know that it would be the answer
but it's the most important thing we
should be looking at
i would worry with the blockchain i
would worry about performance
if everybody votes at once so
i don't think you could say the
government's working on fixing the
election system so the first thing i do
is say
priority one is fixing the election
system and then number two
is making sure that china doesn't eat
our lunch and bringing our industry home
and then number three would be for all
of the the social programs
anything domestic i'd say you got to
trial it and if there's anything you
want to do
i'm not interested until it's been
tested in one state
so i'm not pro or for anything in
particular
until you've done the test and then i'll
look at it i'll look at it with you
did the test show it works did we learn
something should we test it again
and i wouldn't even tell you what my
outcomes would be
i just wouldn't even tell you where it's
going to come out because i don't know
if you hire a ceo do you say
we're going to hire you and i'd like to
like you to tell us
all the decisions you're going to make
in advance
and then the ceo says okay i can do that
i'll tell you all the decisions i'll
make in advance
in advance of seeing information that
would help me make a decision
you wouldn't hire that person you would
hire somebody who knows how to make a
decision when the decision needs to be
made
and if and if somebody doesn't say test
it
first they don't know how to make
decisions
all right
yeah somebody in the comments is saying
the election system does work
the way it was designed that's true
it does work the way it was designed and
it was not designed to serve the public
it was designed to serve the people who
buy the machines
and that's all you need to do all right
that's all for now and
um i'm gonna go work on a dilbert nft
i've already uh created it
but i'm just working on the numbers to
make and the pricing and stuff like that
so i will let you know as soon as
there's a dilbert
nft available that's a digital
collectible
if you wonder why would anybody collect
a digital thing
since you can just reproduce it and the
answer is
i don't know i have no idea why anybody
would collect a digital thing
but the blockchain allows you to know
that you have
you know the only original or one of a
numbered original
and uh yesterday i think it was a
yesterday
jack dorsey uh took the first
ever tweet and turned it into an
nft and i think the bidding was over
ninety thousand dollars
so somebody was willing to pay ninety
thousand dollars it might be a lot more
by now
ninety thousand dollars for a little
text
i imagine it's just a screen grab of the
first tweet
somebody's gonna pay ninety thousand
dollars
for a screen grab only because
it's certified as jack dorsey's
created nft and here's the weird part
i wanted to buy it i wanted to buy it
like i was actually close last night
to doing some research to figure out you
know which
site it's on and making an offer and i
thought
i would pay a hundred thousand dollars
for that and you know why i would pay a
hundred thousand dollars
for a piece of text that jack dorsey
certified as the first
ever tweet because somebody will pay
more
do you need a better reason do you think
that if i paid a hundred thousand
dollars for the the first ever tweet
that it wouldn't be worth more than a
hundred thousand dollars
and fairly soon
the the only thing that would stop it is
if the entire nft market
collapses which could easily happen
right
somebody says who oh my god it's over 2
million somebody said
i'm assuming that's real because more
than one person in the comments says
it's over 2 million
i was thinking of pricing the dilbert
nft at a million
but then wouldn't be enough people
buying it so i'm gonna i'm gonna figure
out
do i want more people to own them
because that's more fun and then they
can bid up the prices they like
or just start out with a ridiculous
price and if nobody buys it that's fine
and if somebody does well that's cool
too
oh it was up to 2.5 million yesterday
um the the dilbert nft uh
does have a curse word in it but
let me tell you what i'm gonna do all
right uh i made one
special comic that doesn't won't appear
anywhere else
and they're two versions one of them has
the f word in it
it would be the only time that a dilbert
comic had that and the other is the same
comic
with the f word taken out so people will
have a choice
of the f-word version or non they'll
both be
nfts separate and we'll see which one
gets gets the highest value so basically
you'll be able to vote with your money
to say which one's more collectible and
it just gives it a little more
interest now to make something
collectible there needs to be
something special about it and what's
special about it you couldn't see it
anywhere else
there will never be another swear word
in a dilbert comic
i think uh and you got a choice of two
different
ones so we'll see and of course dilbert
is the ultimate
native digital property so if there were
going to be digital art
there well let me make a claim i'm going
to make a claim right now
fact-check me on this
dilbert is the most
reproduced digital art
um there there will be an update on the
when tokens i'm going to wait for that
but there's something happening
um that'll i should know in a week or so
about that i get an update today so
there will be another app that uses the
when
but i'm waiting to get the green light
on that
did i ever talk about the tulip craze
well i have a degree in economics so of
course i know about the
tulip craze and i would say that the
tulip craze
is a little different because you can't
collect a tulip
i would say that the nft market would be
more comparable to the
fine art market in the real world
meaning that people buy classic art and
it goes up in value
could it could art in the real world
like actual physical paintings
could that market someday collapse and
nobody wants to buy one because you
could just take a picture of the mona
lisa
it could but hasn't happened yet
so people like to collect stuff i don't
know why
and like i said if i had
i would have i would have been a hundred
thousand dollars for the
for the first tweet just because i knew
as you saw it's already been up to 2.5
million
there wasn't really any question on that
one that was sort of an
easy one you knew that was gonna keep
going up
all right fine art is forever
as as is a digital collectible
we think all right that's all and i will
talk to you
tomorrow
all right uh youtubers
like stamp collecting yeah or coin
collecting or all that
exactly uh can the buyer reproduce it
without mute yeah so here's the thing
anybody can reproduce it
but the copy would not be certified
because the blockchain would know the
difference
between a mere copy and an original
so the the fact that you can make a
photocopy of it
you can also make a copy of the mona
lisa
you can just take a picture of it but
owning a picture of the mona lisa
nobody's going to buy it from you can
you make money on it
the only way people make money on it is
by owning it and it goes up in value
and then reselling it
uh when can you expect it to go on sale
um
i'm i'm in the final research phase
of how to price it and how many to make
and which site to put it on
um couldn't be in a week but i might run
into some obstacles so i don't know
but yeah as soon as a week the
people who follow me on the locals
platform will probably get the first
warning i'll probably give them first
dibs
because they subscribe do you retain
copyright
interesting question interesting
question
i think the copyright is irrelevant
now here's the first thing you need to
know about copyrights you don't have to
apply for a copyright you have the
copyright
upon creation of art so if you take if
you take
your little pen and piece of paper
here's a copyright lesson for you you
take a piece of paper and you pen
and you say here's my art
here i made some art it's copyrighted
it's copyrighted it's already done i
didn't have to do anything
creation just creating it gives you the
copyright that's the law
people confuse the art the act of
creation
which creates a copyright with
registering so when you register
something that makes it easier to defend
in court
so someday somebody claims that it's
theirs and you say aha
here's a government document that shows
on this date
i drew this first so anybody after this
doesn't own the copyright but you could
still win that in court
just as easily if you can also prove
that you were first
the blockchain does that so the
blockchain
makes copyright registering copy right
irrelevant because you have a 100
uncertainty of when you created it
because the blockchain does that
so you don't need copyright so you have
copyright but you don't need to register
it that would be an unnecessary step
within the nft world now i'm not a
lawyer
here hear this carefully i'm not a
lawyer
seems to me i could be wrong but i do
deal with copyright enough that i'm
pretty confident so
i actually removed the copyright line
from the nft that i haven't
that i haven't listed yet for that
reason it seemed like there was no
purpose
for it and i have the added advantage
that
i'm famous and dilbert is famous so if
anybody tried to
invent dilbert tomorrow
it's sort of an easy court case i just
say ah
here are all the newspapers for the last
30 years and you can see that i was
first
all right um
when i sell the dilbert for 2 million i
don't know what people will pay for the
this special dilbert comic but we'll
find out
i also could later do the first dilbert
comic
i would just have to do what jack dorsey
did and certify it
could you do it can i do a single show
with a professional toupee
a lot of you don't know this story but
years ago i dressed up in a disguise
with a toupee and a fake mustache and
pretended to be a business consultant
and went to an actual company and ran
ran one of their meetings
as a consultant and nobody
and what i tried to do was it was a gag
i did it for the san jose mercury news
as part of an article and i got the
senior management in the room
to write the worst mission statement of
all time
because i was actually trying to uh to
persuade them to make the worst one they
could make
it was like really long and convoluted
and just it was useless it was just
they all agreed that it was terrific
when i was done and
then i got a volunteer to put it to
music
because i said you know it's one thing
to have a mission statement but people
won't remember it
so i'll need a volunteer to try to put
it to music and i actually got some of
the
the senior executives to agree some of
them had some musical background
to actually try to come up with a jingle
and a musical score
for their mission statement now after i
got them to agree
to this complete ridiculousness i i took
off my mustache in my disguise and they
they quickly realized who i was
yeah here's the weird thing one of them
suspected it before i even took off the
the disguise which is weird
all right that's all for now and i'll
talk to you tomorrow
