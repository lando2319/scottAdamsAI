all right let's uh check the stock
market
um S&P 500's up a little bit oh it's
Tesla was up almost 7%
we'll talk about that but first let's
make sure I got all your comments
so I can see them as I go
all right there we are
good morning everyone and welcome to the
highlight of human civilization
that's right it's called Coffee with
Scott Adams and you've never had a
better time but if you'd like to try to
take this experience up to levels that
no one can understand with their tiny
shiny human brains all you need is a mug
or a glass a tank or cherine a canteen
jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine end
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called a
simultaneous and it happens now
[Laughter]
don't choke on it like I did
that's good advice
all right well if you didn't know the uh
Tesla robo taxi has launched in a very
minor way there's a few dozen cars
in Austin and I've been watching uh
videos of people riding in the robo taxi
so the robo taxi apparently they put a
safety person in the um passenger seat
so there's no driver of the car the
current versions have a steering wheel
because it's just a regular Tesla but
the uh the ones upcoming will have no
steering wheel and no safety person
riding in the passenger seat
the uh price apparently for every ride
because it's just a very small um test
is $4.20
it's amazing to me that uh that Musk is
is so entertaining all the time so um
the early reports from people who would
uh use their phone and take a picture
and ride in the back of the robo taxi is
that it's awesome
so probably no surprise that Tesla stuck
is up this morning because this is this
is sort of a uh Lindberg you know the
first flight of an airplane kind of a
day where you say to yourself hey this
airplane business this might really take
off um because there's no way in the
world that robo taxis are not going to
be a thing they're going to be a thing
definitely big
all right uh
I'm sure you want to talk about the the
war
so as you know I'm no expert on warfare
or Iran or Israel or anything else but
um I do know the Dilbert filter
and the Dilbert filter is uh when you
assume that everything is like any other
big organization
that as long as you have a you know big
organization
you can make some predictions
and one of the predictions is that the
people in charge will exaggerate their
successes does that seem fair
it's not hard to predict that right
so uh there were these big attacks um
you know what i might not be able to
complete the show today um
because I'm having a little bit of an
event
um so
[Music]
yeah um
let me see
yeah I'm going to have to end the show
now um I'll tell you about it later but
unfortunately I have to end the show now
