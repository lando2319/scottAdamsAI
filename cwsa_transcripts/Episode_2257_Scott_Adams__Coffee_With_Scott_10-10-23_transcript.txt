good morning everybody and welcome to
the upgraded technologically improved
version of coffee WIS Scott Adams the
best thing you've ever seen in your
entire life how'd you like to take it up
to another level wouldn't you I know you
would all you need is a cup mug or a
glass attack your chalous a canteen
joger flask vessel of any kind yes at
the moment we're being held together by
duct tape literally but enough about
that uh it's time now for the
simultaneous zp please join me it
happens now
go oh that's a nice mug you got
there that's
good VHS quality are you kidding me this
is the highest quality this show has
ever been got a new camera over
here I can set her myself a little bit
better no I can't because it's duct
taped
down all right let's talk about all the
things yes we will talk about
Israel but maybe not right first let me
warm you up a little bit before we get
into the heavy stuff
okay well I don't know if you saw Trump
give a spe
uh yesterday the day
before and I just got to tell you that I
was worried that he was losing a step
and maybe he is
but he gave the best speech I've ever
seen actually not just the best for
Trump but maybe just the best thing I've
ever seen a politician do for an
extended speech now there are lots of
speeches where somebody have like a good
line you know uh
you know Martin Luther King you know
JFK there they had some lot of memorable
lines but I happened to turn on Trump at
a rally was it Foxboro or someplace I
forget where it was or maybe something
remind me it where he was the other day
and it was the most relaxed it was in
New Hampshire yes it was the most
relaxed capable speech I've ever seen
anybody give in public
he was funny from start to
finish he failed every fact
Jack the fact Checkers would go crazy
but I was I was especially paying
attention to see if when he failed the
fact checking that you know even I could
tell if it was ever directionally untrue
and it wasn't it wasn't it it was uh
hilariously uh
I'm sorry somebody said it wasn't
streaming on
Rumble oh that's
interesting I've got some kind of a
message going on
there now I'm live I'm live on Rumble
don't worry about it rumble's
live anyway um I thought the contrast
was striking because Biden is
decomposing to the point where you
wonder if B can even stay you know ight
through a
speech so at the same time Biden has
reached his lowest lifetime capability
in public speaking would you agree that
that's true that Biden today is at the
lowest capability that he's probably
ever been as an
adult by contrast and I didn't think
this was going to be true so we'll see
if this is a trend Trump's speech was
the best he's ever given
he he's peing while Joe Biden is close
to
death how in the world is this going to
be a close
election except for I know what your
answer is going to be I know what your
answer is going to be shut up we all
know what your answer is gonna be yes
you didn't have to put it in all capital
letters all capital letters were not
required all right um
so you should actually watch that I I
actually watched the whole speech for
entertainment I had other things to do
but I couldn't think of anything more
entertaining than watching the rest of
his speech and it had nothing to do with
work or anything else it was just flat
out entertaining nobody can do that he's
the only one who can do
that um the other thing I noticed is
that Trump seems
to smartly this would be the smartest
thing he could do it seems like he's
dialed down the dangerous part a little
bit you know when you're first trying to
make a name for yourself you can be you
know much more dangerous sounding
because you don't have to necessarily
execute on anything you say but I think
now as an ex-president he can run on
what he did compared to what's happening
now it's a pretty big
contrast and he doesn't need to make you
afraid or excite you so he's talking
more matter ofly sort of like a dad
who's figured down oh that's what it is
that's his Vibe he his Vibe is a dad who
has it figured out and he's not
wondering what to do like he knows what
to do and he's making jokes with you
about why would you be dumb enough not
to let him do it he knows how to solve
all the problems so it's a really good
vibe the relaxed dad is coming Vibe
rather than the scary I'm going to go
you know kill all the people and drain
the swamp that stuff's a little alarming
to his
non-followers so I think he's made a
good adjustment there but I don't know
if it was
temporary uh RFK Jr announc his
independent
run uh can we agree that he has the
worst luck with timing of any politician
in the history of politicians with
timing he timed his announcement in the
middle of the Israeli
War I don't think there was any other
news yesterday was there was there any
other
news he was the only other news and he
still couldn't get much
coverage
well I know what you're thinking you're
thinking um RFK Jr is going to pull more
votes away from uh Trump voters and make
Trump not win is that what you're
thinking you might be right uh I'm
waiting to see the poll
results so I've decided to hold my
opinion of who he would draw more from
until he actually see I think we'll get
a read on this pretty soon you know I
would imagine the polling companies are
coming up with questions to sus out what
it will look like but uh notably Rob
Riner who you would imagine is uh as
left and Democrat as you could possibly
be he actually well he tweeted this we
don't know what he believes I'm not
going to act like I know it's in his
head I'll just tell you what he tweeted
uh so Rob Riner tweeted this Bobby
Kenedy Jr's announcements run as an
independent is a dangerous and cynical
move by wealthy Republicans to put Trump
back in the white house huh huh I talked
with Bobby and told him that what he was
doing could destroy American democracy
he didn't
care he didn't care I I read it like
that he didn't care he's a director so I
feel like he would approve of me reading
it with you know bringing bringing my
own my own uh skill to
it he didn't care all right here's what
I want to tell you about Rob Riner
number one I don't think anybody knows
less about the world or politics or at
least the way he demonstrated but I used
to think that he just had something
wrong with him or that he was political
brainwashed I don't know if any of those
things are true but I'll tell you what
made me feel a lot better about his
tweets now you cannot say
Mead I will not allow
it that only the NPCs will say
Mead if you say Mead I'm going to stop
every single time and say swimming is
the best form of
Suze because it adds nothing
also yeah
um anybody else do we want to yell a
meathead because swimming is really the
best form of
exercise uh I know it's fun you like to
yell his TV name because it's it's so
amusing right here's all I want to tell
you when you look at Rob rer if you
think of him as performance art which I
do it's actually quite
entertaining because I don't think a
serious person would write any of this
let me ask you what serious
person would say in public that he
doesn't think Bobby Kennedy Jr
wait believes in American democracy or
cares about
it all right that's not really an
opinion of a normal person but it's also
not the opinion of a insane person or a
hypnotized or programmed person the only
person who would say this is somebody
who is
performing now maybe maybe I'm wrong all
I'm saying is if you read it with the
the frame of mind that is performance
art it it works
perfectly who in the world would say
that Bobby Kennedy Junior doesn't care
about democ ruining
democracy no no troll would say that
it's it's just not like even a thing you
would have to say that if you did it for
effect that's something you would have
to say for the effect it would have on
the listener not because you believe
that nobody would believe that so so the
effect he's trying to get in his
performance is for us to say my God my
God how could
anybody that that that a Kennedy who's
done nothing but you know work that
seems directly for for the benefit of
the public and as this long Legacy of
you know of uh benefit to the country
and working for the benefit of the
country that really that person that
person doesn't believe in democracy so
once should see it as a performance that
doesn't bother you at all you go oh that
was pretty clever how you said that to
get people worked
up so try it you'll like
it um question we all have or you should
have is what we're seeing happening in
Israel could some version of that happen
in America could the you know the
attitudes and temperaments against each
other turn into
violence well I would say yes because
we're human beings and we're still part
of History so history suggests that this
stuff can happen pretty quickly and come
out of almost
nothing and I would suggest that we're
see seeing the first signs that um I
didn't realize that colleges are
teaching students that they're that some
of the people in the United States are
colonizers and that when they use the
word
decolonization which apparently is now
becoming popular in college
curriculums uh here's what I see when
somebody calls me a colonizer to me
that's the end word for white
people if somebody calls you a colonizer
let's say you're a white person to me
that's just the nword and it's a called
a violence I don't recommend violence
but just as if you were if you were
black and somebody used the nword in
front of you in a let's say non-ironic
way your first impression would be
violence and you know what I get that I
don't recommend it do not recommend
violence but I get it right if somebody
uses the most
insulting um de
just the most insulting word we we all
have an immediate reaction to that if I
hear somebody call me a colonizer I want
to punch their head off because
it's a called the violence against me
and so my reaction to violence against
me is violence I mean immediately I
don't recommend it and I'm not going to
punch anybody's head off and you
shouldn't
either but I'm only describing the
emotional reaction to it so you you can
use the word colonizer if you want to
but you're going to get the
effect of if You' called me the nword
and I were black that that will be the
outcome can't guarantee what'll happen I
can make no promises about the outcome
of that
interaction um but calling anybody a
colonizer or calling for decolonization
to me is a call to kill white
people let me say it as directly as
possible it's a call to to kill white
people not right away because it's
moving from sort of academic into the
rest of the world but it's a clear
indication that the direction is to
murder white people so I do think that
we'll I don't think that colleges will
self-correct so we are creating a bunch
of students who are primed to murder
white people so it' be amazing if it
doesn't happen I think it will happen I
think there will be waves of murderous
uh decolonizes in our future maybe 5 to
10 years from
now um Hamas has
killed over a thousand uh people in
Israel and of course there are lots of
casualties on the other side as well in
Gaza huge number of
casualties but uh less reported is that
Hamas also murdered uh
Harvard do you remember
Harvard when you were when you were
young didn't you think oh my God if
somebody went to
Harvard there's somebody you can
respect like there's somebody who's got
a you know a really good mind somebody
who's paying paying attention to their
work really trying to make a difference
in the world probably that's something
well as of today uh notable Harvard Alum
are actually disavowing Harvard for
being uh Pro Hamas
now I I might be that might be hyperbole
to say they're Pro Hamas but I've read
the statements from some of the student
groups and it looks
promomy I mean I don't think that's too
far but it might be a little too
far so um I say this without
exaggeration if a young person and this
would not apply to anybody above I don't
know 40 or something if you're above 40
and you've got a Harvard degree I have a
lot of respect for you actually if
you're above 35 something like that uh
I'm gonna say wow you know you really
accomplished something you got into a
you know tough place and made something
of
yourself um but today I wouldn't hire a
young Harvard graduate would you how
many of you would hire somebody who
graduated from Harvard this
year I mean I suppose you would treat
them individually and you still
interview them but if I got if I got
even like a
taste that they had bought into this
cultural uh brainwashing not a chance
you would not want to bring that into
your
company so the weird thing that happened
is that Harvard decided to be really
really open to you to be as diverse as
they could which is a good impulse I
don't mind the diversity part I do think
our institutions should have some
representation that looks a little bit
like the country so I don't I don't
disagree with that but the ironic thing
is that they opened they they had this
huge valuable asset called Harvard and
they opened it up to far more people who
would not have had a chance to be there
otherwise at the same time they ruined
its
reputation so there'll be all these
people was like Yay I got into Harvard
and then when they go for a job
somebody's going to say really Harvard
what year did you graduate
2024
oh that's a
problem yeah no now maybe what will
happen is that there will be like a band
of 10 years where people say you know I
graduated Harvard and people say what
year and it's going to make all the
difference all
right all right the big question in the
news is was Iran directly or indirectly
involved in the Hamas attack on Israel
there's nobody who thinks they weren't
right don't we all just assume like is
that even a question because at the very
least um Iran has been funding them and
organizing them and encourage them so
whether they had a meeting about this
specific
event is a little less important but for
galvanizing public opinion wouldn't it
be nice if there was a specific meeting
that you could point
to right it's one thing to say oh Iran
backs
them but that's not really even close to
saying they had a specific meeting in
which the Iranian officials greenlighted
the
operation th those really feel different
now remember in the fog of War you
should assume that all the news is fake
some of it won't be but but if you want
to be right 90% of the time just assume
everything's fake so we heard from one
news
outlet that they have some secret source
that apparently the government of the
United States does not have because the
government of the United States is not
confirming that there was any meeting
that they know of but it's being
reported in the Press does that sound
like a legitimate story to you do do you
think that our intelligence people dro
the ball and they didn't realize that
they need to make a more direct
connection to
Iran no the story is obviously
fake to me it's obviously fake now
here's what here's what I'm saying and
what I'm not saying I'm not saying Iran
was
uninvolved I'm sure they were and I'm
not saying there was no meeting let's
see I'll say that within a double
negative uh there might have been a
meeting in which it was green light
but do you believe that there's a news
organization who had knowledge about a
specific meeting in a specific time in a
specific
place I'm going to say
 that's the sort of story you
want the public to think is true because
it's actually closer to the truth than
whatever you had in your head whether or
not there was a specific meeting at a
specific time in a specific place it
doesn't really matter it doesn't matter
at all but how would it how would you
feel about it if you thought it were
true the way you'd feel about it is
you'd say oh we've got to directly do
something against Iran but if it was
more just background well they always
support them and always have you know
their money is going there you'd say to
yourself ah I really hate that they're
funding them but I guess we'll just keep
going on the way we are what are you
going to do what are you going to do so
to me that looked like an OP I don't
believe that that's true but it's also
entirely true that the United States
government would intentionally be lying
at it so that there were not greater
calls for war it could suggest that the
military-industrial
complex and the intelligence services
are not on the same page as Biden which
would not be too surprising would it
would you be surprised if you found out
the intelligence people disagreed with
the
administration I I wouldn't be too
surprised because the intelligence
people tend to stay there while the
governments change from Republican to
Democrat at some point you'd imagine
that there would be disagreement between
intelligence and the
government um so that's what it looks
like but none of that should matter the
the least important question should be
was Iran involved of course they were
like why are we even talking about it of
course they were well I don't know about
that specific
meeting all right what about uh
fungibility uh are you sick of hearing
the word
fungible by the way I've never heard the
word fungible so much I I feel like I
caused
it I I know I didn't but it's like Just
an Illusion because you know I'm always
one of the first people to say fungible
because if you're an economics major
it's just one of those words you like to
show off with oh did you know uh I don't
know if the Zeitgeist has picked this up
yet but in my aonomus
book I do talk about the fungibility of
oil and cash yeah so it's one of those
douchebag words people like to pull out
um but since I'm usually one of the
first douchebags I thought God there's a
lot of people saying fungible that
didn't used to say that because the
public doesn't know what it
means but does that
matter does it matter if Iran used the
six billion that
was allegedly
released it doesn't matter at
all do you think they wouldn't have done
this except for that except for that
money that they have spent zero
of now the the Democrat
argument is just so
stupid they try to ignore fungibility as
like a concept and just say that
specific money the specific $6 billion
is still in the accounts and can only be
used for specific things and none of
that money has actually been spent so
therefore they have nothing to do with
it and then the democ then the
Republicans say um but if they knew that
money was coming for things they were
going to spend their money on otherwise
didn't that free up the same amount of
money conceptually that at least
budget-wise they would say to themselves
well we don't need to save money for
these humanitarian things because that's
being taken care
of and then do you know how the
Democrats respond to that
criticism I've seen it a million times
if you watch the news you'll see it over
and over again how do how do the
Democrats respond when you tell them
that money is
fungible I'll tell you how and let's see
moving on to the next
question that's how I've never seen a
Democrat have to answer the
question why do you think money can only
be spent for one thing you know you
don't think people could adjust even
mentally their budget I just want to see
you know Jessica tarlo on the five just
answer that question Jessica do you
understand how money works like you know
the the dollar bills in my pocket you
understand they're just as good as a
dollar bills in your pocket right same
thing money it's unable anyway I don't
think the $6 billion argument has any
bearing on anything completely
irrelevant so the two things we'll talk
about the most are the two least
important things to know the answer to
you know did the $6 billion dollar make
it make a difference it
didn't you maybe it gave them more money
but no if they were going to do this
they were going to do this
it's possible they waited until they got
the six
billion or thought they but they don't
even have it yet we can still pull it
back they still don't have control over
it the I guess the us or somebody still
has control over
it um anyway so don't don't think that
the is Iran involved of course they are
and is money funable of course it is
those are not real arguments those are
just TV arguments because they don't
have enough footage of of the actual
damage happening right now now here's
the other thing you're not hearing on
the
news um why are we still talking about
the Israeli Army going you know door too
and having heavy
losses when Israel calls it a
Siege why don't we just listen to what
they called it they called it a
Siege and they're letting people out who
are
non-combatants so
now I don't know if those people feel
free to leave but that really wouldn't
be Israel's problem they have their own
problems to deal with if if Hamas wants
to start killing its own people to
prevent them from leaving so they can
use them as human Shields that's just
the way it has to go but I would imagine
that um Israel will now starve out the
population to force them to move toward
food and
water now I was corrected on social
media when I suggested that uh
encouraging people to move toward the
food in the water is the same as killing
them all then it's all
genocide I'm not sure that's the same I
I feel like moving people toward food
and water and
safety um is a little bit better than
murdering neither one are good so for
the NPCs watching yes I know it would be
an amazing hardship that I can't even
imagine on on the Gaza residents were
non-combatants I I think the tragedy
will
be
incredible it's also true that they had
a nonviable society that was supported
only by
donations if you live in a nonviable
society that's supported only by
donations something's going to happen
and it's not going to be good so
here um in no special order here's
another argument that's pissing me
off I support Israel and their right to
defend themselves I've always been Pro
pro-israel but there are some arguments
that just piss me off because they're
just too stupid and one of them is that
Israel's the good guy because they
allowed 18,000 workers from Gaza on a
daily basis to come in and work in in
Israel
18,000 out of a million adults when they
have a
70% 70% unemployment
rate if you thought 18,000 was a big
number uh it's not really a big number
when the only jobs that they have are on
the other side of their own border so
that's a small number but I will say
that it's not nothing right letting
18,000 people a day um not knowing
exactly if any of them could be
dangerous
is probably a little risky but I imagine
they go through some heavy fetting
before they do it but 18,000 people it's
not nothing but it's not a lot so don't
imagine that that's like any big
gift because it's
not now what about the question about
the hardship that the Israelis have
imposed on Gaza because that that would
be the argument on the other side well
here's the thing
um as long as Hamas wants to hide among
them and has their support apparently to
do
it um Israel doesn't know of them
anything because it's not their job to
sort out the bad guys from the good guys
in their population it's sort of the
population's job and unfortunately
nobody can help especially if they
especially if they're hypnotized into
thinking that they should be on their
side or if they're threatened I suppose
but Israel can't do anything about about
that that the Israel just has to protect
itself as everyone does all
right um I saw a report that you should
not believe that uh because it was on a
non-credible source but people are
tweeting it around um they're reporting
that Israel is using some kind of
phosphorus bombs in residential
neighborhoods
no I'm sorry that that is just so on the
nose like it's exactly what you're
expecting to see a report of Israel
using illegal Munitions why the
would Israel use illegal Munitions in
this
fight it's I mean it's so it's so
impossible to believe now if if Israel
had an unorganized military where they
couldn't guarantee that you know there
was control of all the units oh maybe
Anything Could Happen but that's not
Israel they do have good you know
command and control if you have command
and control and you're fighting not only
for your
survival but for the hearts and Minds
you're not going to use even one illegal
munition if you had any I mean I'm
guessing every military has some bad
stuff they don't use but it's it is the
least believable thing you're going to
see today and they show a neighborhood
that shows no people and could have been
any where and it shows some like white
powder drifting up or something don't
believe that one all right if you had to
bet on that one you should bet against
that one being real like a 99 to
one all
right
um so as I'm trying to get a feel for
how people are thinking about the uh war
in
Israel um I Look to see how many things
get retweeted and how much so if I tweet
something that gets a lot of retweets I
say to myself oh I must have said
something that other people were
thinking too but I guess I said it well
so along those lines when I did my
thread on um what it looks like is
happening or why Hamas is doing it it's
it's already over eight million
views now if you don't use the X profile
or the
xplatform uh I will tell you that 8
million views on one of my tweets I only
only have a million viewers but
typically I would get
20,000 uh a good a really good post of
mine might get a quarter million like
that's really if I'm killing it getting
a million is pretty rare a million views
but 8 million and growing is
crazy so that means people didn't just
agree they like really great
and one of the things I have to correct
I have a a a correction correction I
gave you some incorrect news some fake
news yesterday I told you that Saudi
Arabia um had already broken off
discussions of normalizing relationships
relations with Israel which was
reported uh not reported it was on
social media but not true not true they
might be
suspended right but suspended means you
know delayed Anything could
happen however so so I'm acknowledging
my fake news
there however it does put Saudi Arabia
in the
narrative uh
s here's what I mean if Saudi Arabia
Waits a little while and then they say
you know what Israel you bastards we can
never do do business with you it's
canceled
forever that changes the narrative to um
maybe Hamas had a
point right that's a big big
problem to the hearts and minds but
suppose the opposite and this might be
the only time the opposite is actually a
possibility suppose uh the Crown Prince
who has so far shown himself to be
ultimate practical leader meaning he'll
do some bad stuff if he thinks he needs
to he'll do some good stuff if he thinks
he needs to and he seems like a
dealmaker um I said that before the
Abraham Accords that there was this
weird situation where Trump Netanyahu
and uh MBS the Crown Prince uh they were
all dealmakers you know by their nature
their personalities they they like to
make deals and so I wasn't I wasn't
surprised when the Abraham Accords
happened because it was dealmakers but
he's still a
dealmaker Netanyahu still a
dealmaker Biden's in charge so that
takes away you know the strongest
dealmaker of the three
potential however imagine if you're
MBS Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and
imagine what it would do to the hearts
and minds of everybody if if after the
waiting a few weeks to see you know what
a TR
what atrocities pop up because there
will be reports of atrocities there will
be reports true or not true of Israeli
atrocities you know that right you can
guarantee there will be reports of
atrocities oh I just told you one I mean
the alleged but almost certainly not
true use of illegal Munitions that's a
report of an atrocity almost guaranteed
to not be true but you're guaranteed to
hear them so guaranteed that some of
them if not most would not be true but I
always want to say that in war there's
nobody who's completely
good right once the soldiers have guns
and the bullets start flying people can
do anything so I don't know maybe they
would be an atrocity Anything Could
Happen from individuals obviously the
government's not going to sanction that
but Anything Could Happen uh but just
assume that any reports you see are
99% on likely to be
true anyway so imagine if the Crown
Prince of Saudi Arabia said you know
what um I've watched how events have
played out over the last month or so
because this is going to last a long
time I've I've watched how events have
played out and I've decided I'm not
going to pick a winner or a
loser and I'm just going to go ahead and
with this
deal that would change
everything it it would just
kneecap uh
Hamas because it would kind of say
they've gone too far basically it would
just be saying I can't support them
they've gone too far and that would
probably be a huge positive in the
region it would isolate
Iran all right um do you think that uh
terrorists are coming through our
borders right now and that it's
inevitable we'll have some kind of mass
event like this where multiple gunmen in
multiple
places attack at the same
time uh well Elon Musk said and I quote
only matter of
time because apparently dozens of known
terrorists have gone through the
Border how do we know that how do we
know that known terrorists went through
the Border doesn't that mean there was
some point where we were looking at
their paperwork like how what what are
the mechanics of that what's that look
like it's like all right uh your name
right says known known
terrorists known terrorist why are you
here are you here for business no no I'm
not going to do any terrorism I'm here
to uh apply for Asylum because I think
people are after me yeah yeah they might
be after you because you're on the
terrorist watch
list I'm here for
Asylum I don't have any specific charges
against you but I do have this law that
says I have to let you
in
approve walk right in sir is that what
happened no I don't think that happened
but what actually did happen how in the
world could we know that there are two
dozen terrorists here how do we know it
unless we talked to them interviewed
them took their picture looked at their
paperwork you had them sign something uh
are you uh terrorists yes I am sir
applying for Asylum yes I am go right
in well here's my second question if
there are two dozen known terrorists in
the
country can't we find them in one day
just by publishing their
photos you just have to tell the public
who they are if you think they're
terrorists and they're here
illegally I'd like to know who they are
I'd like to see a picture of their face
because if they live next to
me I might have to plan accordingly you
know at least move at the very least let
me move right I don't have to take
matters into my own hands but I'd like
to defend myself from the you presumed
terrorists all right um I would agree
that mass terrorist attacks in the
United States are guarant guaranteed at
this
point guaranteed I agree with Elon on
that the current system guarantees
it you know I often tell you that design
is
Destiny we're designed to attract
attacks because The Border's open that's
the design so if you're if you're
predicting that it won't happen you're
not really looking at the design it's
designed to happen it's guaranteed it's
built right into the engineering of our
country right now all
right here's a question um what if men
were in charge of the
country do you think the Border would be
open if men were in charge now I'm not
suggesting this it's not a practical
idea but what if women just couldn't
vote the Border would be close wouldn't
it do you know
why in my entire life I've I've never
met a man who would put up with an open
border and and lawlessness pouring in
I've never met a man now you're saying
but Scott Scott Scott there are plenty
of Democrats who identify as male and do
say we should keep it the way it
is well there's clearly a testosterone
effect here like I I I don't mean to be
insulting but when you see somebody who
identifies as a man
saying that it's okay to keep the
borders porous they're low
te I hate to tell you there's nobody
with a high testosterone who thinks the
Border should be open and can we say
that out loud will I get canceled for
that it's
obvious it's
obvious so let's just let's just call it
like this we're acting like it's the
Democrats who want the Border open it's
kind of women now not Republican women
women not not Republican women but as
women the open border is a woman problem
and a low te problem and our political
parties have divided pretty much along
those lines the high tea
men and the women who like men with
testosterone are on one side and the
lowy men and the women who don't want
strong men anywhere around them are on
the other side so I see this as almost a
chemistry problem as opposed to a
political problem if our chemistry were
right and our testosterone had not
dropped for the last 40 years the Border
would be closed and by the way this is
one of the few opinions in which I have
a 100% confidence most of what I say and
I I try to say it this way I talk in
terms of uh the odds well you know
there's a 50% more chance this will
happen or 99 I just just used the odds
99% chance these stories are false I
like to talk that way but not in this
case because this is just
direct if if the Democrats had the same
amount of testosterone as Republicans we
wouldn't have this
problem if if you back this up to the
root cause it's not politics and it's
not
Trump it's low te this is just a low
test testosterone problem I mean let's
call it what it is it is a low
testosterone problem no man leaves his
family
unprotected if it's easy to to do if
it's easy to solve it as in close the
border we know how to do that stuff no
man with the normal amount of
testosterone agrees to that situation no
man so we should call it what it is it's
a it's a chemical imbalance
which has had a ripple effect on our
border which will get a lot of us killed
for sure it'll get a lot of us skilled
so low te is
deadly um actually low low testosterone
will kill more people probably than
Corona
virus you know if you had mandatory if
you had any mandatory shots it should be
testosterone boosters for
Democrats I am I right if the point of
giving somebody a mandatory
shot is to make the country safer right
it's not for the individual do we agree
with that the the mandatory the fact
that shots are ever mandatory is for the
benefit of the whole it's not about the
individual I mean we want them to do
well too but that's not the point of a
mandate if if it were only about the one
person it'd be like cigarettes well we
we recommend against cigarettes but
you're only killing yourself so free
country go ahead but we don't do that
with shots because it's about it's about
the hole if you want to protect the hole
give Democrat men testosterone boosters
because it's the only chance we'll be
able to defend the
country I've got a feeling that's going
to be a viral
clip we'll
see all right well I have an idea for uh
f ing the situation with Hamas and
America too um and uh this is this is a
recommendation for just Democrats
Republicans can set this one out because
you guys don't know how to solve
anything but Democrats have a
solution um for the open borders as well
as Hamas which is to open their doors
and allow the Hamas people and uh also
all the people streaming across the
border to have a sanctuary in their
homes because we'd like them to be
consistent with their opinions and I
think that we should help them because
they've got this problem where they want
to be helpful to this group of people
that they think are uh victims and
rather than arguing with them why don't
we help them get what they want which is
uh them personally being as close as
possible to the people who they say are
safe and beautiful but others who are
bastards say that they could be
dangerous in some way so I don't think
Republicans should participate in this
but I think the Hamas people would do
really well with the low testosterone uh
men in their Democrat Party and their
women they'd have a lot of fun with
their women so that would be uh an
excellent uh solution for both the
cartel members who are streaming across
the border and Hamas who who will need
someplace to go um and that's something
I call problem
solved Portland now there's the answer
just send them all to Portland everybody
wins right because Portland would say
absolutely bring them here I got an
extra
cut I think that's a win-win we would
have of course have to put a Siege
around Portland but that's down the
road um has anybody seen any news of
Hamas executing any
hostages I have not seen that I don't
know that we
would
no news of that so so they threatened
that they would kill a hostage for every
I don't know day or something that
Israel is attacking
Gaza but yet there are no reports of
it there are no
report oh somebody says they saw a few
videos that weren't real all right
here's what I think will happen given
that Hamas is probably somewhat
distributed and they probably don't have
good command and control I would say
there's a guarantee that some hostages
will be killed and it will be filmed
would you
agree I think that leadership probably
would not order it because it would be
crazy it would be crazy to order it but
they are crazy I think individual like
cells you know who just were through the
fighting and their brains are scrambled
and they're on drugs and stuff I think
they might do it and they might try to
get out now here's here's my uh provoc
statement this won't
happen but imagine a major News Network
um or even a platform a social media
platform uh allowed that content to be
transmitted now I'm not talking of some
troll put it on social media because
that's just the individual but let's say
the
network or the platform allowed those
videos on there would that make that
News Network a legitimate military
Target for Israel
not that they would attack you know NBC
news or something but that wouldn't be
helping here's
why presumably showing uh hostages being
murdered would uh
reduce the Israeli will to
fight because they'd say whoa whoa you
know the the weaker people would say no
no we've got to do everything we can to
save the hostages so let's let's do a
ceasefire we can't see another one of
these videos let's do a ceasefire and
then we'll do a trade of prisoners and
then we'll do some kind of a peace
deal so I would think that the last
thing the uh Israeli leadership wants is
for any of those videos to
service so it wouldn't be good for
Hamas but it also wouldn't be good for
Israel do you agree with that so far
Hamas is leadership really doesn't want
these to get out because that's the end
I mean if there was any any remaining
sympathy for them in any way it would
just
evaporate I don't think there's too much
sympathy for Hamas
specifically but given that neither
hamas's leadership could possit from it
at the same time there's no way that uh
Israel's leadership would want you to
see
them I feel like there's a strong
impulse that no news entity would show
them and social media would scrub them
as soon as they showed up now it might
show up on telegram or something but I
feel like you're never going to see one
because there's going to be something
like a complete news blackout now as
somebody pointed out but Scott that's
how War works there's a news blackout
well it wasn't true in Vietnam so much I
mean the Vietnam War probably went the
way went in part because there were
cameras
there but I would say that recent Wars
recent Wars have definitely been uh a
news
Blackout
um
yeah you can find the videos if you look
but are they videos of hostages or
videos of violence that happened during
the attack because people were
executed during the attack you know
execution Style I don't know if you
could tell the difference could
you is there a difference yeah there's a
difference because one is an attack and
one is a hostage situation in which
there's a risk of them dying and being
filed I say that's pretty
different um anyway I'm going to predict
that you won't see much of these
hostages being executed even if they are
I I I suspect that Israel's calculation
is that they're already gone
you're blaming vaccinations on the
attack okay why not climate change have
we have we blamed the attack on climate
change
yet all
right um so I don't think you'll see it
now I would say that one of the biggest
parts of this story may be suppressed in
the news and it's this drug called
cicon have you ever heard of it it's
what isis uses sort of a meth that makes
you um zombie like it makes you go all
day right you can you can run all day
but also you became immune to
violence so you could just dissect a
person while you're on Capon and you'd
be like okay just having fun here
dissecting a person I disemboweled an
enemy that was fun
yeah so the drug turns people into
zombie
killers
now when you hear about a terrorist
attack of a let's say a cell of
terrorists may maybe it'd be like a
handful they do an attack where they
know they're not going to survive and
what do you say to yourself usually say
thank God this is a rare thing there
there aren't that many people who would
be willing to kill themselves for some
political Point that's not even going to
move the
needle that is very unusual to get
people who be willing to do that even
though there's plenty of it it's a
pretty small part of the
population but
somehow Hamas got a thousand people to
go on a suicide mission at the same time
how do you do that how you get a
thousand people to go on a mission where
none of them would expect to come home
some of them probably did but they
wouldn't expect
to I feel drugs are the drugs are the
story that's not being told I don't
think you can get a thousand people to
do this at the same time without
drugs that's what I
think and by the way if you had access
to that drug and Hamas would have access
because it's all over the Middle East if
you had access to it why would you not
give it to your soldiers it would
actually be like a giant military
mistake to not give it to them when
they're going into a you know almost
certain
death so I'd want to know a lot more
about that yeah I think the Nazis used
it um Isis used it and they got similar
outcomes you know they they did more
attacking than you think people would
have
attacked uh somebody says the japanes
did it for the Bonsai attack I would
imagine why wouldn't you if you had
access to it why wouldn't you
so that's part of the
question now what do think's going to
happen with the siege the first thing
that's going to happen is you're not
going to pretty soon you won't see video
you'll see distant videos of you know
things blowing up and you'll see you
know ones and TW e of people being
injured and being loaded in ambulances
and stuff but you're not going to know
if it really happened from this war or
some other war that they just took the
video from but how would anybody get a
video out of
Gaza because at the moment they don't
have electricity so they won't have
phones they won't have internet how
would they they w't have cell phones
right um how would they get any video
out you well I doubt was
Starling I mean I don't know so they
have generators in the short run but do
you think those generators well actually
let me correct myself I'll bet they've
had
um poor Reliance on their grid so they
probably more generators than we know
about but generators operate
on generators operate on gas right how
long will gas be available I feel like
they've got 30 days of generators
maximum like there might be some hidden
lies of them or
something solar I don't know I don't
feel like they have a lot of solar power
over
there but but you're right solar could
be part of
it they smuggle out v v
VHS yeah I
suppose they could smuggle out some
stuff um but I don't think you'll see
much I think the uh lid will be pretty
tight
no these videos were on the internet
well I haven't seen any so I don't know
which internet you're looking
at um rescue up being planned do you
think there will be rescue Ops for
the um for the
hostages not even sure that that will be
attempted honestly because I think it'd
be too dangerous to go in and it's not
likely anybody survive if you
attacked it looks like a bad play maybe
if there's a special case all right I'd
like to solve this problem with
something called economics you ready
what is the most valuable information in
the world
today what what is the one piece of
information that somebody would pay the
most for this current information I'm
not talking about something that's
always been true or solving an equation
nothing like that I mean something
that's happening in the world right now
what's the most valuable piece of
information let's see if you can get
this your PayPal account okay your
crypto password now the most valuable
information in the whole world not just
for
you there you go there you
go uh I'm G give you partial credit
because I'm not sure which leader you're
talking about the most the most valuable
information in world is where the
leadership of Iran is at any
moment am I right if you're
Israel you should have already the most
enormous reward set up by crypto so it's
untraceable uh a Bitcoin reward if you
can tell me where the leadership is now
I'm talking about the top five you know
top five or so and if and here's another
way could you could also do it as a
betting
app Could you um no that wouldn't work
it would have to be some kind of an app
where you would have multiple reports
like you wouldn't rely on one report and
you'd probably have to verify it so if
somebody said all right I got a $10
million reward or it could be A1 billion
do reward what would it be worth to you
to know where the leader of Iran was so
you could take him
out
$10
billion that would be cheap compared to
a war I mean that would be nothing yeah
it'd be worth about10 billion nobody
would pay it but that's what it would be
worth so the most valuable information
in the world is where the Iranian
leadership is because in my opinion
Israel has a free pass to take them
out that's what I think in a way they
never did before and it's possible that
that time will pass like they will no
longer have that window
where they can take out the leadership
have something like some kind of
explanation or reason for it and not
make things worse it might might make
things worse but they're likely to rip
the Band-Aid off because here's the
problem if everybody did a truce
today and Iran is still has money and is
still in charge it's just going to
happen again later except bigger and
better their entire plan is that we will
keep doing this forever until it works
if your plan is explicitly we'll keep
trying until it
works you've got to get rid of those
people it's your only it's your only
path to uh
safety now what would happen if how
would the Iranian public react the
public if their leadership were taken
out because of
this it would actually be
uh um
okay I'm just shaking my head some
somebody was pointing out that it would
be an AC of war against
Iran that's exactly what I'm
suggesting I'm suggesting it's an of War
you don't have to put a word on it total
Act of War they they have uh and of
course it is a war they've literally de
declared war so any military Target is
game at this point and the and the
leadership of Iran is just a military
Target so whether or not you call that a
war or not it is what it is and doesn't
matter what you call
it
um could you say that Ukraine is an
active
war against
Russia by the
US I mean I'm not going to make
analogies now you're missing my logic
you're missing my
logic I don't give a if it's an AC
of War so if you're arguing well what is
this an act of war or is this an act of
War you're missing my point I don't care
and I don't think Israel should care
because your label for it doesn't change
anything shit's going to happen the way
it happens no matter what label you put
on it so label it a war compare it to
other places if you want it doesn't have
any real world impact that's just talkie
online
um remember when hell times used to ask
Obama
often that's a weird
comment by the way how do you like my
camera setup is this
better
better I think it's a little
better all right ladies and gentlemen
that's all I've got for today I'm going
to talk to the people on the locals
platform because they're special but I'm
going to say goodbye to uh Twitter and
YouTube and Rumble where we're streaming
live at the same time on this camera
this camera right
here and I'll talk to you
tomorrow
