hey everybody
come on in yeah i'm almost a half a
minute late
i know that's not like me but you know i
got a lot of stuff going on
so aren't you glad you're here at the
best part of the day
coffee with scott adams yeah doesn't
matter what else happens today
you're off to a good start and if you'd
like to make it
the best all you need is a couple of
mugger glasses tanker jealous designer
canteen flash a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the
dopamine of the day the thing makes
everything better except the
variant of the coronavirus it's called
the simultaneous up it happens now
go
well i hope that made everything better
for you
all right uh let's talk about the news
um i wonder if there were if there's any
way to calculate
how many people the fake news kills
because in theory you could do that
right
so take the uh the vaccine situation
so you've got a very high number of
african americans
who say they don't want to get the
vaccination and you have to think
that at least some of that is because
the fake news
uh said that trump um
was supporting neo-nazis in
charlottesville
also known as the find people hoax
because in fact you said the opposite of
what was reported
and also the drinking bleach hoax
imagine if those two stories didn't
exist plus you know the whole
rest of the stories that trump's a
monster racist
and anti-science imagine if the fake
news had not been saying for four years
that trump was not only a racist by
anti-science
what would be the difference in the
vaccination rate
of black americans because i feel like
it would be
something right and i feel as if you
could probably come up with an estimate
of like well
you know we got 60 but it would have
been 70
so 10 didn't get vaccinated and then you
could just sort of work the math and see
how many people they killed
am i wrong wouldn't you be able to do
that math and actually estimate how many
people he literally killed
now the tuskegee story
ask yourself this now everybody knows
the tuskegee
uh horrible story about uh black airmen
who were
uh let's see was it intentionally
infected right
and that story i don't believe would
have necessarily
been in the news if obama were president
because if obama were president the
story would be
hey everybody obama's got a vaccination
you're going to like it i think it would
have been fine
and the black citizens of this country
probably would have said something along
the lines of all right i'll give it a
chance
but i do believe that the fake news
has an actual death count at this point
that would be hard to dispute
here's my biggest question in the world
right now
how does china have no infections
especially in wuhan how do you have
international travel or is this the part
i have wrong
did china stop all international travel
at the moment unlike currently is there
no travel from outside the country
into china because there has to be right
and how in the world if there's still
international
travel in china how is it they don't
have an
infection problem during a pandemic
doesn't it tell you that there's
something
really big that we don't know about this
story
now you might say to yourself yes scott
what you don't know is
that they you know there's some kids
conspiracy theories story
about 20 million cell phones going dead
around the time that wuhan was being
locked down
the implication being that they just you
know killed 20 million people to stop
the virus
well suppose they did you know i'm not i
don't think they did but suppose they
did
or suppose that their extreme lockdown
in wuhan
was like really really extreme like like
you heard they were boarding people in
their you know boarding up doorways and
stuff
suppose all of that happened let's say
they murdered 20 million people i don't
think they did but let's just say they
did
and they boarded people and they it was
extreme extreme
extreme lockdown and let's say it worked
because why wouldn't it really i mean it
should work right
if you nailed everybody in their homes
for three weeks
there would be no virus but here's the
problem
don't they still have international
travel am i wrong about that
now i don't think that they have quite
the testing that they could
thoroughly test people getting on and
off planes
so there's something else going on right
am i wrong about that how in the world
can you explain anybody controlling the
virus
when there's still international travel
how is that possible
it's only possible if there's some
gigantic variable
that we don't know about somebody's
saying it's because the survival
rate is high so maybe they just don't
notice i don't think so
i think the hospitals would be impacted
we probably know by now
so uh you have to sort of
assume that there's something bad going
on not just
something you don't know about but at
this point
it almost seems obvious that either the
virus
doesn't have as much effect on chinese
ethnic people or they have a treatment
that works well and they're not sharing
which i think would be the highest
probability
my guess is that they're using some
other kind of
treatment in china and we just don't
know about it that's my guess
here's an example of good persuasion in
the form of good
framing from josh hawley in congress
and i just want to tell you the way he
framed a topic it was better than i've
seen before so he's talking about
the allegations of election fraud
and most people when they talk about
election fraud
they say the election was stolen look at
my numbers
you know lots of people voted for trump
and
sizes of the crowds etc now you've
noticed that that attack has not been
extra persuasive right everybody who
says
the election was stolen is met by some
democrat who says
there's no proof and that's it right
the election was stolen there's no proof
that's kind of the end of the
conversation isn't it
so josh hawley does not fall into that
bad framing that is just a clear dead
end
and he says this instead i'm
paraphrasing but it'll get you the
the idea he talks about how after four
years of the russia collusion hoax
that it's sort of rich that the
democrats would be
uh saying that the republicans should
just accept that the election as
legitimate
after experiencing four years of the
other side doing
nothing like that and it all turning
into a hoax
but here's how hawley i can never
pronounce his name
here's how he sums it up instead of
saying that election was stolen
he says that republicans are being told
their concerns about the election don't
matter
isn't that good republicans are being
told their concerns
about the elections don't matter that's
really strong
because it's true even if you are a
democrat
and even if you think there is nothing
wrong with the election and you just
want to move on
even if you think the republicans are
just crazy
it is nonetheless true and unambiguously
true
the republicans are told their concerns
about the election
don't matter don't matter
now it would be one thing to say that
the election was stolen or not stolen
but we don't even get to that point
we don't we don't even get to determine
whether
there's any evidence or not because
things that were
tried to get into court were rejected
for standing and
doctrinal latches and other
so we've never really had a hearing in
which the evidence was presented
with some you know some opportunity for
counter evidence and debate so it's
never really happened
so since we've never had a forum in
which the evidence
that is you know still being collected
could be presented
along with the people who who have the
counter evidence
never been presented wouldn't you say
that perfectly what perfectly describes
the situation is that
republicans are being told that their
concerns about the election
don't matter that's exactly what's
happening it's really strong persuasion
to say it that way
well rasmussen is saying that both the
legacy media
and congress have approval levels below
20 percent
to which i said below
20 percent are you telling me that
congress
and the media are higher than 10
doesn't that seem wrong have you met
anybody who approves of the media or
congress
ever if you go into a
uh how about this holiday season try
this experiment
go around to each of your relatives that
you're not supposed to be seeing because
you're socially
distancing and ask them one at a time so
the others can't hear it
so uh what do you think of the job of
congress
see how many of your relatives
apparently there are 20 percent of
people who will say yeah they're doing a
good job
see if you can get even one of your
relatives to say
you know all things being equal if i'm
being fair
yeah i think they're you know i think
they're criticized unfairly
think they're doing a pretty good job
see if you can get
one relative to say that do you believe
that
that nearly 20 percent of people said
yeah congress is pretty good and by the
way the media is pretty
pretty accurate i don't know about that
you might get it from the media but i
don't think anybody
is going to say they like congress
there's this chronovirus variant now in
the uk and maybe other places it's been
there for a long time and the question
is
whether we should close travel
and i guess canada is closing travel
from great britain
and the united states is not
now which of those decisions sounds
better to you
we don't quite know exactly if this is a
big new threat
because maybe the vaccines work the same
they say it might be
more virulent or you know more
transmissible that would be
horrible but i don't think we know that
feels like it's too early to know if
it's more transmissible but
what should we do about it
should we do a candidate did and say
well we don't know
could be bad maybe it's not but we'll
just be careful in close travel
or do you say like we did apparently
well we don't see the reason to close
yet
so not yet which one of those two
strategies
is smart and which one
is really dumb
you should know the answer to this
question the smart one is to shut it
down
because you don't know how big the risk
is it's kind of a no-brainer
are you telling me that there's somebody
in the uk who just
absolutely needs to travel to the united
states
now if we have americans who are trying
to get home
there's probably a testing regimen that
they can do and you know
until the until they have the result
they have to stay in a room or something
so you know there might be some trouble
getting people back
and then of course there's also the
problem that the other countries that
have not closed travel the uk people
could just fly to germany and then fly
here or something like that
so you don't get them all but you get a
lot of them
it feels like it feels like it's
obvious that closing travel from the uk
at least until we know more
it just seems obvious you may remember i
was
among the first to call for a closing
travel to china
about a week before the president did
and that was right
why would i be wrong this time
all right so we got this uh
giant relief package for the coronavirus
uh and it's uh 2.3 trillion
and it looks like it's uh over 5000
pages
and even aoc apparently aoc is on the
same team with everybody she said that
members of congress have not read this
bill it's over 5000 pages
arrived at 2 pm today and we're told to
expect to vote on it in two hours
so congress got two hours for every
member of congress to read a 5
000 page document
and what aoc says is that this isn't
governance
it's hostage taking which is a pretty
good analogy as analogies go
and when i tweeted this people
went into the comments and they said
yeah but you voted for it
if you're if you don't like it why'd you
vote for at aoc
you're complaining about it but then you
voted for it i'm seeing it in the
comments
what does hostage situation mean to you
she called it a hostage situation
do you let the kidnappers kill the
hostage is that your plan
because i feel as though if you have the
money
depending on the situation you might
want to pay the the ransom and get your
hostage back
i don't feel the aoc was being
hypocritical
saying it's a hostage situation and then
treating it like a hostage situation
which is she had to vote for it she had
no choice
now remember i was telling you that the
republic is dead
because we at the very least we can't be
sure
that the will of the people was
translated into the outcome
you know it could be it's possible that
the election was
fair enough that the actual outcome was
represented in the
you know in the vote but we don't know
and it seems highly unlikely that it was
because there are so many ways it could
have been
gamed and so many people want to do it
but on top of
having no idea if we're voting for our
candidates or not
you actually don't even know if your
vote made any difference on top of that
once they're in office they create
legislation that even they don't read
so what you want to have is a republic
right and the republic would be where
you elect your representatives
and they go make decisions on your
behalf
now if that worked you know if that's
what we were actually observing
i'd say to myself on paper on paper that
looks pretty good
looks pretty good because we elect smart
people
and they could probably make better
decisions than we can you know they're
checking in with us
of course they're not ignoring the
public they're just taking the
leadership
but what does it mean
to have elected your smart
representatives
and give them no opportunity to look at
the things they're voting for
the big things right that's
not even close to a republic
because first of all we don't know if we
elected these people
and second of all they didn't do
anything like representing us
they didn't do anything like that nor
did they even have the option
all they had was the option of a hostage
situation that's it
so we have never been further from
something that looked like a
you know democratic republic will of the
people we're
we are a million miles from that there's
just nothing
like representative democracy
um and so
uh looks like uh congressman matt gates
is going to join other
republicans in challenging the electoral
college now
as i understand it if you get at least
one senator
you force a a debate now
forcing a debate doesn't mean the
outcome will change it just means
procedurally i guess you have to have a
debate now if we have a debate in
congress
will that be the first trial
like thing in which there are people on
both sides of the issue
who can ask the experts about the
evidence and the witnesses etc
this would be the first time wouldn't it
because
and i don't know exactly if if congress
ended up debating the electoral college
do they get to bring in witnesses and if
they don't get to bring in witnesses i
would think that at least they could say
what the witness
you know wrote wrote down on a affidavit
so will this not be the first time
there's a trial on the evidence
such as it is not proof all right we
don't know if it's proof
but there's plenty of evidence it'll be
the first time right
fact check me on that it would it be a
proper debate
with both sides because it's the both
sides that's important
if all you do is another hearing where
republicans
talk to friendly witnesses that means
nothing you got to have the other side
in this or
you don't have anything um
there have been a few before this i'm
hearing
i'm confusing this with senate hearings
maybe
now now uh general flynn and i guess
some other people have
uh been involved in conversations
talking about you know what to do about
the
alleged election irregularities
and some of the ideas that have been
floated are a
federal seizure of voting machines in
the swing states
so just have the federal government
through i guess an executive order
just go take control of them and then
they can be watered in etc
and then another one is uh scarier
which is the military would go into
these the swing states that
we have some questions about and they
would hold the second
election that feels
so impractical i think we could rule
that one out
but what about the federal seizure of
voting machines
i can't think of any reason not to do
that can you
because whether or not there's anything
on these voting machines that's a
problem
do we all agree that we we as citizens
would like to know
and we'd like to know if there's a
problem on there
i don't want to just guess and if the
only way you can do that is to have the
feds
seize those machines is there even any
argument against that
you know i i get that you don't want the
the feds to step on the states and it's
the state's responsibility
but in a situation in which there is
extreme doubt about the outcome of the
election and the
viability of our system that seems
perfectly appropriate
why wouldn't you have you heard any
argument against that why wouldn't you
somebody says the logs have been wiped
if the logs have been wiped
then that's reason enough for congress
not to certify anything because that
would be evidence of
uh of bad stuff i would think
well the ceo of fireeye a cyber security
company
um so they're involved in uh the looking
at
who was involved in the massive cyber
attack that is being blamed on russia
but apparently this fellow who is
an expert in a company that's an expert
at this and is involved in this very
situation
they're not so sure it was russia
so pompeo says it's pretty clear it was
russia
and this expert also agrees
that it is uh it fits the russian
profile
and it's very consistent with a russia
attack
but he's not willing to say it's
definitely russia
however here's the interesting part he
says that with time
and enough effort you could actually
know for sure
do you think that's true do you think
that with some amount of time and effort
that somehow we have not had enough time
and effort yet we've known about this
hack for i guess months now
but with additional time we would figure
out who it was
and we haven't done it so far it feels
like if we haven't done it so far there
wouldn't be much of a trail there at
least digitally
so maybe they have other assets or other
ways to find out with human intel
i'm a little suspicious that if you wait
longer
you could be sure where the attack came
from that just feels like something
that's not a thing
if we don't already know if we knew
already then i'd say oh yeah i guess we
found out
um so there's some
talk that the modern vaccine
vaccination and maybe the other ones do
would work against this
variant in great britain and that would
be good news
i don't know if it's good enough news to
continue the way we're going but
yeah good news
and that is just about all that's
happening
because it's the week of christmas
um and it's a slow news
time have you looked at poor cnn lately
look at their news page
it's it's a little sad actually
it's a little sad because
they don't have enough trump news
because trump just sort of went
undercover and all all he talks about is
you know the election and stuff
i see here's somebody saying something
about tesla is there
something happening with the tesla stock
today that i need to know about
not really down a little bit no big deal
all right yeah no trump no drama so
apparently
biden's plan of starving the news
business
of anything interesting is working
really well
and he is so far successfully starving
the news
industry of of everything
um oh somebody's saying uh
tesla is moving to texas and tesla is
putting in the s p
500 so there's some news on that
all right um
if you're not familiar with q look it up
i don't think i'll be looking for q i
see you asking for a wenhub
update i'll give you the the brief thing
is that the coronavirus the pandemic
pretty much put us out of business but
the uh
the tokens the when still exist because
they they live forever on the blockchain
so we are looking for other other uses
for
a token that exists and could be used
for anything so if there's anybody who's
thinking of starting any kind of a
business that would require a token
we could potentially fund you with some
of the tokens for free
if what you're doing creates a demand
for other tokens
so if there's anybody out there who has
a business that they don't want to start
their own tokens and get them listed
which is kind of hard it's really hard
if you just want to use ones that exist
we could set you up on that and that
would make the web token
valuable all right um
if your business model was remote
experts why would covet kill the
business
had more to do with the the team and
where our efforts were
and my own my own efforts being entirely
this stuff so
uh newsome recall you know i know the
news and recall
uh petitions and stuff are going on but
i don't really have a
big opinion on that apparently he has 60
approval rating in california i don't
know if that's true
um somebody says to check my thyroid
because you think i have a goiter why do
you think i have a goiter
oh are you seeing this this is a if
you're seeing my neck
uh this is a scar from um
voice surgery so my vocal cords so if it
looks like there's some irregularity on
my neck
that's that's what that's from just the
scar
yeah somebody on twitter suggested it
was time for me to make my move to take
over the world
and i've been thinking the same thing
really i think it's just time for me to
take over the world
now i don't mean in a dictator kind of a
way
but i feel as if all the people are in
charge are not
believable anymore and that
the the real government will you know
there's a good chance it will migrate
to simply smart people that you don't
think are lying
they might be wrong they might be right
they might have a different bias than
you have
but if you're not getting your
leadership from people that you at least
know aren't lying
you're not really getting leadership
right so do you think that biden will
always tell you the truth did the
democrats think that trump was always
telling the truth
no but let me ask you this do you think
you pick pick anyone from twitter who
you follow
that you think is honest do you think
that they'll lie to you
intentionally no no
they will not lie to you intentionally
there's there's lots
lots of people you could identify who
are not in politics
uh let's i'll just pick one name tim
poole
if you watch you know independent
journalist tim poole do you think that
tim poole will ever
just lie no
there's almost no chance of that right i
mean you can say anybody can lie i
suppose in some generic way
but no no you know that he might be
right
he might be wrong he might agree with
you he might disagree with you
but you don't really have any doubt that
he's telling you the truth
take joe rogan do you do you wonder if
joe rogan is telling you the truth
no no he heard that he earned it through
you know lots of public stuff that makes
it very clear
that he can be right he can be wrong but
he's always telling you what he thinks
is true
even if it's wrong yeah cernovich is
another one etc
so there are people who could be wrong
but they're not going to lie to you
and we probably need to start
moving a little bit of the the power or
the influence of this country
over to the people who aren't trying to
screw you
so maybe there's some kind of a hybrid
system that would compensate for the
fact that the republic
is is over you know we're sort of
running on fumes it's just inertia right
now but the
the system the republic truly doesn't
exist
we're we're like the homeopathy
version of the republic you know where
you
you keep diluting the water until it's
there's only the
memory of the drug but the drug isn't
there anymore i don't think it's real by
the way
but that's what homeopath homeopathy is
about
all right uh it's called free enterprise
but what are the yeah i'm seeing you
making a uh eric swalwell
joke because his last name has a sexual
connotation and sure enough
he found himself in that situation
um why do i blink like that
so i've often been told that i get
blinky i think it's when i'm tired or
nervous or something
i mean i don't feel especially nervous
but i'm i'm a serial blinker
and i don't know it when i'm doing it i
only know it when i watch it
on playback uh
your sinuses are acting up they feel
pretty good at the moment
pretty good all right um
is locals the best way to contact you
about business no use linkedin
so just use linkedin i do i see all the
messages in linkedin
i don't respond to them all but if if
it's a business
thing i'll see it so you can guarantee
you'll see it sometime in the next
week or so and that
is all i have for you today
unfortunately unless you have some
amazing questions that i see in the next
five seconds
we'll make this a short one why only one
sip of coffee
because that's all you need that's all
you need is one
am i leaving california as of today
i'm probably going to think about it
if you asked me yesterday i would have
said no but
things move fast
thanks for dunesberry thanks a lot
your head is blocking your books well
there you go there you go there's those
books
by the way my book had to fail at almost
everything and still win big came out in
2013
and when it did my publisher told me
that it would be
an evergreen an evergreen is a book that
doesn't just sell well for a year and
then disappear
but rather it becomes one that just sort
of lives forever and
sells well for year after year after
year and sure enough
the how to fail book actually the oldest
of my books
is selling the most briskly and actually
picking up steam
years later because there's so much buzz
about it now
so i don't know if you've noticed how
many things that book
influenced so anywhere you see anybody
talking about
something that sounds like a talent
stack that was from that book
anytime you see somebody talking about
systems being better than goals
almost certainly they read that book
before they did their own thing
please fill your shelves does it bother
you that the shelves are not filled
um your wife is reading how to fail
right now
and i'll bet she'll like it oh you you
bought two copies yeah the most
common thing i hear about that book is
people buying multiple copies and buying
it all the time
thc today as soon as we're done here
i i haven't started but today today's
the day i'm gonna need to dig in pretty
hard
um haven't heard much about christina's
pilot license
well that's on hold at the moment
and uh
all right how was the expanse oh yeah i
started watching the expanse
it's good i mean the the sci-fi shows i
don't watch the same way
as i watch other stuff the sci-fi stuff
i want to i want to feel like i'm in a
world you know it creates a world and
you know those people and you go live
with them
so i watched the sci-fi less for the
plot
and more for the absorbing atmosphere
all right
why not russia as a new u.s state
okay who will be president at the end of
january i would expect
biden will get in because as josh
hawley said people don't care that
republicans don't like it it's just
going to happen
all right
how are your sinuses very good so i had
the sinus surgery
unfortunately i have a marker that
suggests my
sinus problems will re-emerge but won't
happen right away
and that's all i got for now don't want
to bore you to death
i'll let you go bye for now
all right we're done with um
we're done with periscope uh how's your
week after you said last week was the
worst week ever
it's about the same honestly about the
same
um i i can honestly say that this month
would be one of the two or three worst
times of my life
probably but i'm perfectly healthy
and still rich so
i'm very resilient i i've had my entire
life
destroyed a number of times so it's
nothing new
all right that's all for now i will talk
to you
tomorrow
