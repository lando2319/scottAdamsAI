good morning everybody and welcome to
the best thing that's ever happened to
you
yep i say that every day because it's
true every single day we're we're going
nowhere but up we're like the omicron
variant
of podcasts you can't stop us but we're
mild we're mild and we won't hurt you
but you can't stop us
and if you'd like to take this to the
next level and why wouldn't you
when i look at you
i see
people who are smarter
better sexier than everyone else who's
not watching this
and so i know you'd like to take it up
the next level and all you need is a
couple of mug or a glass of ticker
chelsea's diet a canteen joke or a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
it's better than a vaccination it's
better than ivermectin it's better than
lots of things go
sublime
savor it
savor it
stop and smell the coffee beans
or whatever you got going there
all right so i have to ask this at the
end of yesterday's
live stream i gave you a tip for
removing
foods from your diet and sulfites in
particular has anybody else discovered
that they do have an allergy to sulfides
or sulfites
i'm seeing some more people here i've
got a feeling it might be massive
could it be that have you noticed that
there's a asthma
uh i need an update on this but the last
i knew
there was this um
huge uptick in asthma in adults
in the united states
can somebody fact-check that for me
i know that was true a while ago you
know years ago that there was this giant
unexplained uptick in asthma
and it took me decades to find out it
was that additive that was that was
getting me what if it's just the
additive
what if that explains everything because
most asthma is either triggered by
exercise or allergies
and if this if if there's a food
additive
that
got to some percentage of the public and
caused them to have allergies that would
trigger your asthma
so it could be a food allergy
is the reason that the asthma spiked
i'm gonna say maybe
just to guess but speculatively maybe
let me tell you something that a system
i've been using on twitter that's one of
the best things that i ever came up with
you've heard it before but i just want
to reinforce it so you can use it
yourself
if somebody comes after you personally
on twitter you know they're not
criticizing the argument they're calling
you stupid or you know just some
personal insult
before you respond
before you respond because you want to
you're going to want to insult them back
right away
check the profile
and see if it's somebody who works in
the arts
because ever since i started doing that
and then sharing it with you
you'll find that people who work in the
arts go for the ad hominem
i don't know exactly why
it could be a combination of things one
it could be they don't have the
analytical skills to go at it a
different way
but two it could be they don't have the
same distinction between reality and
fantasy
in other words it might not you know
matter to them so much if you're right
it just matters that they're mad at you
because you disagree
and
so i think there's also a performance
element to it
that people insulting especially
somebody who's you know in the public
eye when people insult me i think
there's always a performance element to
it that has nothing to do with me
specifically
and so as soon as i see that it's
somebody in the arts
i completely discount it
because i just say oh that's just them
that's just them that's just them being
them
because the moment you think it's about
you
you're you're going to be mad
it's not about you
it's about them it's about the
performance they want to put on
it's about them dealing with their own
feelings and emotion
and
the the number of times that i get
insulted and then i check and oh it's an
artist
it's a writer
or it's a visual artist of some kind
uh often they work in hollywood
yeah i'll tell you the
the hollywood
writers are absolutely the worst
they're the ones who come after me the
most because they hate me also because i
make money writing
and if you're a writer you really hate
people who make money writing
98 of them do because 98 of writers
don't make much money writing
so
that's my advice to you now did you all
see the elon musk response to elizabeth
warren on twitter
if you haven't seen it it's one for the
ages so on the same day that elon musk
becomes time person of the year
elon musk proved to us why
he is the best choice they've ever made
for the time person of the year
if he wasn't already time person of the
year
you'd have to give him some
consideration
just based on this tweet response
that alone if he'd never if he never
fired a rocket into space or become the
richest person in the world
so uh or the country i guess so
elizabeth warren decides to use elon
musk as her
i don't know uh
there's some word for it uh if you just
use somebody as your
example i guess but i'm looking for a
smarter sounding word
and she says let's change the rigged tax
code so the person of the year meaning
elon musk will actually pay taxes and
stop freeloading off everyone else
what
[Laughter]
what
freeloading
elon musk
he's like single-handedly solving the
biggest problems in the world for our
country
i mean between he elon musk i would say
is the reason that battery technology is
advancing so much i mean tesla's got to
be the big driver of showing that that
market exists etc and of course battery
storage will be you know one of the key
technologies of the future then you stay
here's the space
better than nasa was doing the most
important strategic thing in the history
of well the entire history of the united
states
controlling space and having space
competence
first
nothing's more important than that
so elon musk is doing like the work that
even our government can do it's so
important
and and she's like calling him a
freeloader
so elon musk who also is the only
marketing for tesla
which is also a wonderful fact
that he's so good at getting attention
that he doesn't need to do marketing
there's nobody who doesn't know him you
know everybody's following he's the
person of the year time person of the
year so it's the best marketing
i've ever seen i've never seen anybody
do marketing better than this have you
i mean apple was pretty great but they
spent money on it
he spends no money and he gets the same
bang for the buck as apple does
i think he's the best marketer
of all time
i mean is it
is that is that too much
there's nobody else who spends zero
and guess this
consistently right so i think you could
make an argument he's the best marketer
who ever lived
if you're just looking at the numbers
anyway
so after elizabeth warren tries to dunk
on elon musk which is the
literally the worst idea anybody had
ever had in the world
elon first his first reaction tweet was
just this
stop projecting
now of course that one's
you know it doesn't really hit the mark
it's just you know just sort of like a
warning shot
he followed it up soon after with
another tweet
he said
you remind me of when i was a kid with
my friend's angry mom would just
randomly yell at everyone for no reason
oh my god
now
it's not that
it's not that he wrote it like a joke
per se
but it's the combination of who he is
and who she is
and what she did
that makes this so wonderful because as
soon as he says it you can see it that's
what makes it so powerful
because elizabeth warren does have sort
of a
she does have sort of an angry mom
persona
and
when you hear the richest man in the
world call it out like like the topic is
taxes
so instead of talking about tax rates
he calls her out for big
like his friend's angry mom and you
can't stop seeing it the trouble is this
is a trump-like attack
as soon as you hear
that she looks like your friend's angry
mom
good luck ever seeing her another way
again
this is pure uh low energy jeb um
level quality
stuff
so i'll never see her as anything but
elon musk's friend's angry mom but then
he's not done
he's got one more tweet in him he's not
done
the next two years follow-up is
please don't call the manager on me
senator karen i'm like
oh god
the fact that
oh
somebody
uh somebody who was must have been a
democrat
tweeted in that uh that elon musk you
know he has all this money he should uh
hire a professional to write his tweets
for him
and i thought to myself i don't know any
professional who could write a tweet
this well
except for trump but i don't think he's
for hire
this is like the best set of tweets i've
ever seen i mean i'm exaggerating a
little bit but you can't do better than
this
you can't do better than this this this
is peak tweeting right here
he's the richest man in the world the
number one best marketer of all time and
damn it he can tweet better than
everybody
it's probably not a coincidence
he might be smart or something
rumor has it
anyway
i don't know this could not be more i've
never seen a more complete takedown of a
politician
he basically ended her
i mean this seriously this is this is
bush level take down you know with with
trump taking out jeb bush
this is just wonderful
and then later he followed it up i
didn't copy that tweet but he noted that
in all likelihood
that elon musk will pay more taxes this
year
than any human has ever paid
this year
at least in the united states he's going
to pay more taxes just this year than
any human has ever paid
[Laughter]
now i assume that's related to his uh
selling his stock
because he agreed that he would sell the
you know 10 of his stock or something in
that range
so that creates an enormous uh i think
something like
what uh three or four billion dollar tax
bill
does anybody know what his taxes would
look like
just based on what uh stock he sold
somewhere in that range right a few
billion
so when you're going to pay your taxes
just realize that
that he's paying a few billion yeah it
would be capital gains would probably be
25
of whatever he sells 2.5 billion maybe
something in that range
uh anyway
that was fun
so the uh january 6 uh
committee they they're they have so they
they have so much nothing
that they're trying to turn nothing into
something
so yesterday i kept reading the uh the
headlines
they were trying to make something
out of the nothing
that uh i guess three fox news hosts
had texted mark meadows on january 6 and
asked him to ask the president
to call off the protests
but the way that the stories were
written
it was as if they'd found a bombshell
as if this was a big breaking story
if they finally found the smoking gun
what
there's literally nothing there
what are we supposed to take from it
that
some fox news hosts knew how to text
mark meadows
no surprise there right
are we still supposed to take from it
that uh
hannity and laura ingram were in on the
plot
because their texts say the opposite
it's pretty clear from the the text
that nobody at fox news
had been aware that there was some kind
of an insurrection plan
now let me ask you this so most of my
viewers are you know you lean at least a
little bit right
and this is one of those blind spots on
the left let me ask you this
if there had been an actual planned
at any level
insurrection
in which trump was part of the planning
which would mean some some constellation
of aids were part of the planning
do you think that hannity would not know
that
right
seriously if you know anything about the
world
or certainly anything about the
conservative ecosystem you know who
knows who who's connected to who
tell me the odds that hannity and laura
ingram
wouldn't would be unaware of an
insurrection plot
if there was an insurrection plot
i mean seriously
hannity
had he would talk to the president like
every day
do you think the president
would have even attempted
wait for it do you think trump
given given who he is his knowledge of
of you know the media how things work
do you think that trump
would have planned an actual
insurrection
without talking to hannity
to find out how hannity would handle it
nope
because there's no way an insurrection
works if fox news doesn't go along with
it right
am i right
everybody on the right knows that
the president knows that
if if fox news just turned hard against
the president let's say there was an uh
insurrection
would have turned on him
and the whole thing would fall apart and
the right would turn on just not fox but
the whole right would turn on
and you don't think that the president
was smart enough
to check that out first
say hey you know sean
i'm just noodling with this idea
how would you take it if i did that
now if hannity said i'm all in let's uh
overthrow the you know the constitution
well that would be a different story but
obviously the opposite happened he was
not in on anything
and as soon as he saw something
developing
he panicked not panic that's
i hate when people say that about
anybody he immediately acted no panic he
acted
as he should
as a patriot as a citizen
and he did what he could do to try to
make you stop
here's what the story should have been
fox news hosts
highly responsible patriots
act immediately to stop trouble
now they were saying things like it
looks bad for our side and that was
obvious
still
they acted as patriots am i wrong i mean
you could dislike
them for whatever opinions you disagree
with blah blah
but in this instance
the fox news hosts were just pure
patriots in my opinion i think they just
said they saw trouble and they tried to
stop it
so that's the story and somehow the news
was trying to present it like there was
some big breaking thing that was
negative for the right and was really
exactly the opposite
it was very complementary to the right
in you know within this context
and yeah and it was self-preservation of
course it was self-preservation but what
is the situation in which a patriot
uh
is preserving you know themselves and
it's not the same as the country i mean
the country's interests and and their
own were matched
so you know if you say it's
self-interest that's true
but do you think they wanted a riot at
the capitol i don't think they wanted
that either you can want two things
it's okay to want two things
all right
so this whole ivormectin thing won't go
away
and
uh here's just a
couple of things
that people said about it
uh anatoly lubarski was pointing out
that
uh hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin
both were widely used in peru since the
beginning of the pandemic he said this
in a tweet
and then he showed some data that says
now peru is leading the world in deaths
per million in excess deaths
um so i had asked is there any country
that just went you know wild with
ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine and got
a good result
well we know there's one that
used it heavily and got a bad result
doesn't mean because of it
yeah we could have
also bad information or something
um and then another doctor was pointing
out that uh and i only heard this
yesterday but it sounds about right
there's some trials showing the effect
at least ivermectin's positive effects
for covid were either frauds so we do
know that some of the ivermectin studies
were frauds not all of them but the
apparently some of the biggest benefit
ones were frauds and that excuse the
rest of them
um if you're doing a meta-analysis
excuse the average
and
but also it turns out that some of the
benefits of ivermectin could be
explained by co-infection with worms
in other words it's a bad deal to have
worms in you at the same time you get
infected with covet because you've got a
double whammy
so
it makes perfect sense that if you
treated the worms with hyvermectin
and that made a difference
that that would seem to have an effect
on the coven recovery because you go
from two big problems to one
so that could be blinding us to the
actual effects of uh ivermectin on
coven
now uh i know that you don't believe
this
um yeah somebody's saying japan lowest
case in the world
the
do you know that
there's no bad cases in any asian
country
can somebody confirm that
can i get a confirmation there's no bad
case in any asian country so if you're
looking at any western country
i'm not going to count india so i'm
going to count uh i'm going to count
yeah in india's
part of the region but of let's say of
asiatic people
um
i don't know where they're you know
there you have a let's say
what's the best say
um
ethnically asian
because that would not be the case for
indians right
uh
and part of the speculation is and by
the way india would be a counter example
to this some of the speculation is there
might have been some prior infection
that was more
uh asian-centric and so a lot of people
have some prior infection
in a related cousin coronavirus that
gives them some protection
so that's one possible because the a lot
of the asian countries are handling it
differently
and if they're handling it differently
and all getting a pretty good result
there must be something else going on
right
but uh japan is not a story of
ivermectin that that's just not true
um as far as i know
i could be wrong
but
um
here's my take on it
so
would you agree with me that no matter
how many smart people
no matter how many smart people are
telling me that ivermectin works
i can't say for sure it doesn't
would you say that's fair
if i were to tell you i am positive this
doesn't work
i think you could call me an idiot
and that should stick
fair if i were to tell you that
definitely doesn't work
i think you could call me an idiot
for being certain
just for being certain but suppose i
told you this see if this is fair
the longer we go without a confirmation
the kind that even the top experts say
oh yeah that's confirmation the longer
we go without that confirmation the less
likely
there's something there
that's just my general feeling about it
same with hydroxychloroquine
we've gone long enough now that if
something was there i would be super
super surprised
not a hundred percent
right i'm not even 100 of the
hydroxychloroquine and i think
that's been you know more disproved than
just about anything
by time
so
um here's my take on this
there's there's the belief the people
following dr mccullough especially that
there might have been some early
treatments that the big
big medicine machine
uh
kind of
used some fake news and
some shenanigans to make us think that
the alternatives to vaccinations don't
work
okay
so do you believe
that big medicine whatever that means or
the big medicine machine which might
include you know i don't know the news
and
the government somewhat do you think
that big medicine machine
suppressed
ivermectin
just because they didn't want
competition
maybe
here's my take on it i don't think
that's the case but
let me let me get on your side for a
moment if i may
if it ever came out
if it ever came out that anybody in a
professional
field
intentionally
and the and the key word here is
intentionally with data
if it ever came out that somebody
intentionally killed
a treatment
that we knew to work or had a high
likelihood to work
i would say that's got to be the death
sentence
i think that we have to treat
big pharma
misdeeds
as mass murder if that's done
intentionally if it's uh if it's
negligence
that's something else
but if we could ever show that somebody
knew
they were doing something to manipulate
public opinion or even medical opinion
or
or government opinion if we could
confirm that somebody did that in a way
that was just to make money
and we knew that it cost
people their lives
what's the penalty for that
it should be death
does anybody disagree because it should
be about the same as terrorism
and i think that should be a death
sentence
because it's mass murder and it's
intentional under the hypothetical
right now let me tell you that i don't
have any information anything like that
has ever happened
here's what i think does happen
now here's a here's a view of the world
that i suspect
is annoyingly accurate
which is that people only know what they
decide they want to know right
so let's say you were a vaccine
executive
and you were trying to make a billions
of dollars a trillion dollars on
vaccines
and somebody came to you and said well
what are we saying about ivermectin
there's all these meta studies that show
that it works
and
a lot of serious people say it works
yeah oxycontin is a good cautionary tale
you're right
so what's the more likely
thing that a an executive of a drug
company would say
well if it were me and i were a weasel
i'd say
don't show me any ivermectin data
ever until somebody official says it's
proven that it works which hasn't
happened
i'm gonna say it's not proven that it
doesn't work so we better get these
vaccinations
now
is that a crime
because they're just willfully
keeping themselves away from a certain
kind of information
because they feel that they have enough
not exactly
so i think that you can get a situation
where a lot of people would be making
choices
that coincidentally
are good for their uh financial futures
and may be bad for the world
i'm just going to say that i don't think
if if you look like you're going to make
billions of dollars for vaccinations
you're not going to dig too hard to find
an alternative to it
and you're not going to say anything
good about it and if you're talking to a
politician you're going to say look
vaccines will probably work because
that's who you work for
but i ivermectin that's not your product
so you say
you know a lot of people are warning
against it a lot of people are calling
it horse medicine you could just talk it
down
without saying anything untrue
my suspicion is
that the you know
big medicine machine did try to kill
these things these competing things
but that they also thought they probably
didn't work
so i can't take the side that says they
knew they worked and they tried to
suppress them anyway
i haven't seen anything like that
or the one that says um
they they definitely don't work
blah blah because i don't know
so i'm on the side that says probably
the people who were
trying to suppress it suspected it might
have worked but they were using the fact
that it wasn't proven
to further their financial gain which is
not illegal
i don't think it's illegal it's more
like marketing unfortunately
now
there's also the
the belief which i see a lot
that the real reason that the cheaper
alternatives to vaccinations were not
pursued is that if they existed
the vaccines could not get their
emergency authorization how many of you
believe that that's true
do you believe it's true that
alternatives were suppressed
because the medical community wanted
vaccinations to be the thing
um here's a perfectly good study no
there's no such thing as a perfectly
good study
spectre
uh yeah showing me a study on ivermectin
isn't gonna have any impact on me
because the studies we know are so often
fraudulent i just wouldn't know what i'm
looking at
i wouldn't know if it was a good study
or not
all right so here's here's my take on
the belief that we couldn't get an
emergency authorization for vaccines if
we found that there was an alternative
who do you think was making that
decision
do you think the trump administration
was presented with this alternative hey
mr trump
we could not only get vaccinations
but we could be treating the heck out of
this with these therapeutics until the
vaccinations get there
and the only problem is if the if they
work we can't get the emergency
authorization
mr president trump so what do we do
does trump say oh
damn
i guess we'll have to suppress all those
excellent treatments
to wait for the vaccination
do you imagine that's how that
conversation went
did you think that trump was presented
with the choice of totally good
therapeutics and that he said
no don't push those because then the
emergency authorization won't work
does that sound like something trump
would do
have you ever met trump
no
no
no no hold on whoever's uh i'm gonna get
rid of you for being an
top naivety today
see that that's the kind of um
comment that you're either new to me or
you're just
alright
i believe it is uh impossible
literally impossible to imagine
that president trump would say oh
there's nothing i could do when he's
handing out executive orders like candy
in the middle of the pandemic
trump would have said
and i can't read minds but i'm pretty
confident about this
one because anybody would have done this
literally anybody would have said wait a
minute the only thing that's keeping
this from not happening is that there's
some rule
oh give me an executive order we'll get
rid of that by this afternoon
now suppose it wasn't trump himself
suppose trump never heard that
proposition but rather
members of staff heard it
was there a member of the staff who said
well i could take this idea to the
president
and it would solve the pandemic
but i don't think i want to
because i want those vaccinations
do you think that happened
no so the part of the story that's
clearly missing
is the part where somebody in the
administration actually made that
decision
nobody would make that decision
the the vaccination or the
the pharma companies might make that
decision
but they're not in the government
you're telling me that
uh i don't know trump and his whole
administration were all bribed by big
pharma
to ignore the other treatments when
obviously the other treatments would
have made trump president for a second
term
you're telling me trump would give up a
second term
just so the vaccinations would be the
only thing
it's not good for trump
wouldn't be good for anybody on his team
so you'd have to assume that trump and
his entire team acted against their own
interests for that
theory to make sense
uh add layers of censorship and threats
of losing one's life no because every
every citizen knew about this trade-off
it's not reasonable to assume that his
staff
working on this issue
weren't also aware of the rumors at
least
that the
that the emergency authorization was
holding things up they would have known
that we all knew it
if the public knew it they obviously
knew it
deep state in bed with pharma doesn't
work that way
it doesn't work that way
if you are an underling you might take a
bribe or be influenced by big pharma
if there's something that doesn't matter
to your political future
even if you're a top politician well you
might be influenced by big pharma
but if there's a direct choice
between getting re-elected or doing what
big pharma wants
you tell me that trump chose to do what
big pharma wanted
instead of getting re-elected for a
second term
in no world did that happen in no world
did that happen
all right
trump is as close as you can get to
incorruptable on a question limited to
that right
yeah any other question you know you're
on your own but on the very limited
question of did he want to get
re-elected
no there wasn't any bribe that was big
enough
there's no bribe big enough that would
have kept him for wanting to get
reelected i feel very confident about
that can't read minds could be surprised
nothing's 100
but really if you if you believe the
emergency authorization held things up
you've got a lot of assumptions that you
need to wrap around that to hold it
together and i just don't see how it
could be done
but i could be wrong
there could be some twist to this that i
don't see
could be wrong
all right but i do think if we find
anybody in big pharma who is doing that
sort of thing the death sentence is not
too strong
it should be the death sentence
and by the way we should put that out
there it should be actually i think we
should put it into law
we should say that if big pharma
hides information that causes mass
casualties that that should be a death
sentence
because you need to put that fear into
them
because you know i think a career
criminal might not care about the death
sentence
but if you're an executive and you're
just doing stuff for money you might
care about the death sentence
you might you might care about that a
lot
all right so omicron is out competing
delta we hear today
and that
one death in great britain or the uk
that we heard about there was somebody
who died with
omicron
cnn has now converted dying with omicron
to dying
of omicron
so it made that a subtle shift
of dying with it that could have been a
coincidence
to dying of it
i don't know that that was supported by
the facts could be it could be that they
have better information about what that
one patient experienced
but i doubt it
i doubt it
all right
and we are still being told that even if
omicron is mild we should not get
too complacent because the sheer volume
of this mildness might crash the
hospitals
wait
wait what
we should not be complacent
even if it's mild
because there would be so much mildness
it would crash our healthcare
do you think somebody is trying to
brainwash you into getting vaccinated
because this doesn't even make sense
here's how it would make sense if they
were not trying to brainwash you
there are a couple different ways this
omicron could go
it could be the thing that solves all of
our problems and turns out to be more of
a vaccination than a virus
or
this is a real possibility we could be
underestimating it and it could be a big
problem
wouldn't that be fair
did i say something that was
unreasonable
given that we don't know
it could be a vaccination and it could
be more of a problem than we think
but to say one person died of it which
probably we can't even confirm
and it's so mild there could be a lot of
this mildness isn't that exactly what we
want
lots of mild virus
what could be better than a super fast
mild coronavirus that is vaccinating us
from the delta
because i think that's what it does
yeah when you see the the news treated
this way i mean this is so not
an objective look at the news
all right
um talk about timing
who has the best timing in the world
well
sometimes me
sometimes me
do you remember yesterday i was uh
giving i think it was yesterday
the day before i was giving you the
the best doves for the year
was that yesterday
and i called out the most persuasive
person was michael shellenberger
and i said that he'd move the needle on
people's opinion about nuclear energy
from half of the country being negative
to literally everybody's on board now
basically the entire the entire country
turned pro nuclear
at just about the time he was doing the
most
i'll use this phrase nuclear-powered
persuasion on it
i think he actually turned the bow
but it gets better i mentioned just as
an aside i said that he'd changed his
focus recently
to san francisco he's got a book out
called san francisco
which is doing really well you should
read it
and
uh he's going after the you know san
francisco in particular their management
of the the homelessness and the the
drugs and the crime
and he had a bunch of of
real world solutions so it wasn't just
complaining it was saying other other
places have done these things these
things work the things they're doing
don't work
and he was really pounding it hard i
mean really talking to the right people
tweeting writing articles that were just
pure fire
and
showing data
to back everything up i mean just really
persuasive stuff
yesterday
san francisco mayor london breed
just uh gave a press release
and she has announced a major crackdown
on crime including open-air drug dealing
which was
michael schellenberger's one of his
biggest focuses car break-ins and retail
theft
and as michael points out in his own
tweet about it he says the plan contains
much of what i and my colleagues at
california peace have been advocating
damn
he actually got this done
what
what
he actually got this done
so london breed went on further the
mayor of san francisco
and says we need to change course and
how we handle public safety in san
francisco we can't be a place where
everything goes everything where
anything goes on the street
today i am announcing a series of new
steps steps to address public safety in
our city
boom
boom
i called that yesterday
[Applause]
i called that yesterday
now bradley says it was an accident it
wasn't
it wasn't
i can tell you that michael
sheldenberger had burrowed deeply into
you know all of the heads of the
decision makers
because he does have that skill
well merry christmas
for at the venice beach dub club
even though you don't agree with me
merry christmas to you and merry
christmas to everybody who doesn't agree
with me
speaking of agreeing with me i ran this
obnoxious poll
possibly the most obnoxious thing i've
ever done and i've done a lot of
obnoxious things
this is the most obnoxious thing i've
done well recently this week
i ran a poll and said this if you saw me
specifically me
disagreeing with the top expert in a
field in which i have no experience
but i'm only disagreeing on one specific
point within the field
who would you bet on
if you didn't know anything else about
the topic so no fair saying i need to
know more about the topic you have to
bet
whose side you're on without knowing
anything anything else
and why would you why would you bet on
the expert or why would you bet on me
um
i see expert i see some people agree
with me
and i'm seeing on locals they're saying
my history of prediction
all right here's the answer
you should bet on me
right
and i realize how
[Laughter]
dr robert johnson is saying bet on scott
all right here's here's the reason why
the answer is me
number one
uh and here's the trick part of the
question
the important part of the question is
i'm disagreeing on one specific point
if i looked at everything the expert
said
i'm not questioning it
so the only situation in which there
would ever be a disagreement between me
and an expert who was a top expert in
the field the only time i would ever
disagree
is if i saw one little thing
where my special skills of
detection
could just see it clearly
so in other words i wouldn't take a shot
unless i knew i could hit it
see what i'm saying
if you've watched my track record you
know that i don't i don't take on every
topic
because i think well i don't know what
do i have to add to that well if the
experts say so
i mean 99 of every topic i go with the
experts
one percent of the time or something
small i say wait a minute wait a minute
i have a little insight on that specific
thing just that one point
and i know that's a lie let me give you
an example
when dr fauci initially said don't wear
masks they won't help now forget about
the argument of whether masks help okay
i'm just telling you i can call in a lie
i am the only person in the united
states a public figure who said loudly
and clearly that's a lie
i detect that
now am i an expert on masks
no
no
does fauci know way more than i do about
infectious diseases
yeah
yeah i mean you can criticize him all
day long about whatever but he's
definitely
a top expert in the field now who was
right
turns out that i accurately called out
his lie
number two
when we first heard that wuhan was
having a problem
who was
one of the two first public figures i
think jack bassabic was on this fast
who was one of the top people who said
nope you're wrong all you experts are
wrong close those borders close the
borders
i did
i was literally cursing the storm and
screaming at my screen
for trump to close the border
a week later he closed the border what
do the experts say now
should have done it sooner or more
completely might have made a difference
it might have saved a hundred thousand
lives may have sounded may have saved a
hundred thousand lives
when we did it i mean it could have been
worse
so
if you see me disagreeing with dr
mccullough
who is as somebody pointed out one of
the most cited people in the field a top
expert
but i'm only picking out one thing
i haven't done that by the way by the
way i haven't found anything i disagreed
with
only because i don't know everything he
says
but
if i did that
who should you bet on
me
and it has to do with the fact that i
would select
the one special area
that that i could see quite clearly
there was a problem
now
does this make me magic
nope let me give you you know an example
if if a an experienced police officer
told you that somebody was lying
but you weren't sure
who would you believe
well i'd believe the police officer
because even though i feel pretty good
about my lie detection skills i wouldn't
put it up against a 25-year police
professional
who only sees lies all day
i mean if you've been a cop for 25 years
and you can't detect
a perp who's lying to you
with you know 80 90 accuracy
uh then you haven't been doing your job
so
you have to look at what the specific
thing is and the specific question but i
wouldn't take a shot at a top expert
unless i knew i had the shot
so that that's what's different about me
i have a track record where you can see
that
if it was just some random smart person
you wouldn't know there wouldn't be a
track record to look at
okay
um
surprisingly in the poll
at least last time i checked i was
slightly ahead of the experts
because i think
i think many of you were clever enough
to know that when i added the one
specific point part
that that gave me an advantage
that's you know not representative of my
knowledge
yeah don't take the shot unless you know
you can make it that's a similar to a
trial lawyer you're never supposed to
ask a question if you don't already know
the answer
so it's sort of like that yeah
low-hanging fruit
yeah that's another way to put it
low-hanging fruit
all right those were my prepared
remarks i told the people on locals i'd
take some
questions for i haven't watched rogan
mccullough and i have a challenge for
you because joe rogan interviewed dr
mccullough
now
here's my challenge to you
summarize
if you can in one sentence ideally one
sentence but i won't hold you to it
summarize for me and then tweet it at me
or put it in the comments
one claim that he makes
that you think i would disagree with
because i haven't heard anything i
disagreed with yet
i've only heard people talking about it
yet so i want to hear something that you
think i would disagree with
the masked thing was possibly a plot to
make people believe
uh oh i don't know about that okay
all right
no asymptomatic spread i don't know what
that means
oh is he saying that it doesn't spread
asymptomatically
that sounds like word thinking to me
that just means somebody's not aware
that they have it
i'm not sure that there's anything there
i would disagree with
that you can't catch covet twice
i
i believe the science says
that at least one person has caught
covered twice but it's rare so what
don't we agree on that that's the same
thing he would say right
he says you can't get kova twice i agree
with that
with the exception that i know there
were a few people
who got it twice but they were i think
they were immuno compromised so it
doesn't mean anything so in terms of the
larger picture i completely agree with
him okay
i'm not sure if these are his thoughts
or your thoughts
somebody says no there are many that got
it twice
i'm not aware of that
will i please um about the interview
maybe i don't think that got lost
um
can't catch the same variant twice i
don't really have an opinion on that so
there's nothing i would disagree with
um
he said
hydroxychloroquine is effective
he did or did he say it might be
i'll bet he didn't say that
uh i bet he didn't say that
oh betty said
it might be
so that it was a it was a good risk
management so you're saying that he's
the so he alone is saying that
hydroxychloroquine works
what about ivermectin does he say that
works
he said it worked for his patients
oh
that's it
uh can somebody confirm this i hope he
didn't say this are you telling me that
dr mccullough thinks hydroxychloroquine
works because it worked for his patients
did that actually happen that didn't
happen did it please tell me that's not
true
okay i'm seeing somebody say it's not
true
no that's nice okay i that didn't sound
like it so i think here's the problem
i'm not sure if anybody understands him
well enough
to tell me something that he said that i
would disagree with
i don't believe you on the
hydroxychloroquine part i think you're
you're not accurate on that
you said hydroxychloroquine is 64
effective
when used early
um now what's my opinion on that
my opinion is
that if it were effective we would know
about it
by now
um
everybody agrees with early treatment
but he's talking about a specific way to
treat it
which is exactly why you should just
watch the interview well i will watch
the interview
but what i'm telling you is i'm
fascinated by the fact that
everybody thinks he's saying great
things
and you can't describe them
even in layperson's terms
uh your advice to me is terrible by the
way so your advice is
that if i watch it i'll be convinced can
somebody here tell me what i always say
about that
do you believe that if i watched dr
mccullough
i would be convinced that he sounds
credible how many of you think i would
be convinced
would i be convinced if i listen to him
well
i'll give you two answers
my rational brain would say i should not
be convinced because i'm not hearing the
other side
anytime you're hearing one expert
talking to a non-expert you are being
misled
because you don't hear the other side
but
i also might just
disagree on sort of a general statement
because he's a rogue doctor
the elephant in the room covent is
dangerous but not at the border why
scott
are you really confused about that i
feel like that's just one of those
political things people say
like they act confused
like why
if covet is so bad
why are we opening the borders is there
anybody who's legitimately confused
about that i know it's one of those
things people say to make a political
point but is there anybody who actually
doesn't understand it
you actually don't understand it
it's because they value
um the
the well-being of the immigrants over
the well-being of these citizens
what else would it be
why is there any mystery of this at all
it's very direct
if they valued the citizens health over
the well-being of the immigrants it
would be the opposite they'd just stop
them from coming in
but that's a decision
it's a decision to rank the well-being
of the immigrants
higher
than the the risk to the
the country
what what is the mystery about that
where do you see the mystery
why is that confusing
now if you say you would have chosen
differently i get that but it's not
confusing
you act like it's a mystery or something
it's very direct
now
could i support their opinion yeah i
could
here's the argument for it it's not my
argument right i'm i'm america first
so this is not my argument but i'll show
you that there is an argument for it it
goes like this
people are people you know
one life is one life
the people coming across the border are
in desperate situation
um
you know we try to keep them someplace
for two weeks there's probably some
mitigation that we don't know about
maybe not
but
all things considered
we'd rather help these people in
desperate situations
than we would protect a few extra
hundred thousand americans
that's the argument
the argument is it's bad for everybody
but it's worse bad for them so
so that's where empathy goes
um
you could argue that it's being done
poorly that's a separate argument
um
yes you can get covered over and over if
your immune system is depressed that's
right
uh not desperate
yes you're right uh i i live in
california so i do have an insight
into how many of the uh people coming or
just for economic reasons and how many
are
desperately in trouble and just claiming
that they're a risk and the answer is
it's for economic reasons but everybody
knows that right
there's nobody confused about that it is
for economic reasons
um oh interesting somebody's wife works
with adults with special needs and a
number of them have contracted covert
twice
interesting
all right um
what are your thoughts on dave rubin
leaving california
i don't know do you need my opinion on
that
isn't that between dave and california
like why does my opinion have anything
to do with anything
um
it certainly makes sense i mean i'll
just say the obvious thing which is
uh you know he's going from a less free
state to a more free state
but you know he also has to deal with
the humidity
if he can handle the humidity
uh then it was an excellent move
i don't think i could handle the
humidity so i'm not sure it's an option
for me
texas maybe
all right
please ask locals if anyone has been
able to play back the interview tips
well they should also exist on youtube
so if you know which day i did that
go to the youtube version
that will play for you
why do you continue to support
california with your tax dollars
well not paying taxes is a bad idea so
the real question is why do i stay in
california
and the answer is it's it's hard to move
and i haven't found someplace better
now there are lots places that are
better in certain ways
but i haven't found a place that's
better in all the ways that i needed to
be better so i would i mean
nothing would stop me if if i could
solve all my connections
but i can't
all right um
it's sort of a network effect you know
for for you techy nerds so california is
sort of a network effect you get
embedded in every way
it's just it's just so hard
um
oh yeah the two-stage solution would be
the ultimate but i can't have two houses
i'm a one house one car guy
as soon as you add a second car or a
second house
which i've done
the the complications just go
just you know it just becomes incredible
so i need simplicity so one car one
house
um
ignorance is no defense ignorance of
what
i don't know what you're talking about
all right um
yeah imagine all the water leaks
i've had something like 12
major water leaks and none of them are
related to any construction problem or
material use they're just all
coincidences they're just all unrelated
scottsdale arizona i don't like deserts
deserts make me feel creepy i've never
liked being in any kind of
desert escape i just feel
i feel exposed
here's what it is
i don't want to die
because i went
outdoors that's one of my biggest
reasons for living in california
is that where i live
i could go outdoors
for
two hours
any time
and not die
like it could be the coldest day in the
winter
but i'm still going to be in the 40s
you know i could go out without a coat
for two hours i'd be very unhappy
but totally alive
totally alive very unhappy
but i wouldn't die and there are tons of
places where you just couldn't go
outside you know if it's winter there i
almost died in the snow once that's a
long story but
um
oh
when will the jackhammering end i think
never
it feels like will drought kill
california we've had i think
historically there have been worse ones
uh but it
could
you said yesterday that you don't fear
death i don't fear it
i avoid it
isn't that different
i don't want to go outdoors
where where death is a possibility it's
not because i'm afraid of it it's
because dying is not on my wish list
california has banned gas-powered
engines and starting in 2024 that
doesn't sound right
how are the desalination plants going i
don't think there are any
dude you don't go outside
oh you'd be surprised
um i'll watch the mccullough playback
today
i guess i have to go to spotify for that
right
it's a spotify thing
it's just a small engine band in
california that sounds more right
oh and and generators that's right gas
generators and
oh leaf blowers
i don't know are the electric ones any
better
all right um
no gas generators interesting
but that's gasoline right that's not gas
as in
the gas that runs your stove
does christina ever talk about going to
space she would go into heartbeat yeah
she she actually said she would go to
mars
she likes that stuff
all right that's all for now and
i would like to take my leave now and do
some other things
i think you'll agree this is the best
thing you've ever done in your life
i'm going to turn it off before i see
any disagreements but
go forth and have a merry christmas
i'll talk to you tomorrow
