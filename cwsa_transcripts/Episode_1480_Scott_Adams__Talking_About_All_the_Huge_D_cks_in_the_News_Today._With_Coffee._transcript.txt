[Music]
good morning everybody
and what a terrific day it is
today is the day that you'll have an
unexpectedly better day than you
expected
yeah never start a sentence if you don't
know how it's going to end it ends up
like that
but if you'd like to start something
that does end well
well let me tell you i got something for
you it's called the simultaneous sip
have you heard of it
yeah it's very big it's all over the
world and all you need to participate in
this
mass exercise of
unity
is a copper mugger glass a tanker
chalice or stein a kentine jugger flask
a vessel
of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i still like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it happen now go
that's some good stuff
speaking of good stuff
i once had the following idea which is
that we spend a lot of time in the
bathroom
and wouldn't it be great
if every time you entered let's say the
bathroom that you usually use because
most of us are
creatures of routine
if uh there was some kind of sensor that
knew who you were
recognized you by your i don't know your
apple watch or something
and automatically brought up a
two-minute
lesson
of something useful that you could learn
in two minutes
and i called it turd university
because you'd be doing your business
and in about two minutes you'd learn a
new skill
and since you use the restroom every day
you'd learn 365 skills in one year
with no effort whatsoever you're going
to be there anyway and maybe you didn't
bring any reading material
and so
i didn't realize that i had accidentally
created turd university
but i called it my locals
my
my locals subscription service
so in addition to my other content
that's too edgy to be in the general
public such as my
robots read news comic strip
um here are some of the things that
people are learning in
on the local subscription platform
uh i'll just give you an example i think
i've got hundreds of them now so these
are micro lessons two minute lessons or
so that i give people
so you can learn how to maximize your
creativity how to set up your own live
stream
uh when to believe the experts uh voice
variability
uh fun versus efficiency
just give you some more
there are just hundreds of them
controlling what you can control
some of them are just funny determining
your human value managing your ego
learning to speak well and i've got one
coming up that i'm going to record today
on how to brag
without bragging
so those are the things i've got my
white board all queued up
and if you were paying seven dollars a
month
to be on the local subscription platform
uh
one of one of the things that i promise
is that you will get hundreds of dollars
of value every month
in terms of how it makes your life
better
all right so
let's see what's going on here
in the in what we call the news
um
first of all isis k
may have just attacked in
just before i got on i saw that
the kabul airport had some kind of
explosion and gunfire at one of the
gates
could be isis k
now i don't like isis k as a name
because it's a little bit too cool
i don't like naming a terror
organization
after something that sounds like a boy
band
it sounds just a little bit too
attractive
hey have you seen what isis k is up to
what i'd like to get their album
so i think we've branded them poorly
just a little bit too cool
now if you don't know about isis k they
want to start a caliphate
over there in the afghanistanish
and
the taliban are considered too liberal
for them
that's right they're the natural enemy
of the taliban because the taliban's a
little too flexible
but isis k not so flexible
and so the question is
and again
you have to wonder about this don't you
will the taliban's control of
afghanistan make us
more safe or less safe from isis k
i don't know
because the taliban are their enemies
and the taliban could probably be more
brutal in tracking him down and killing
them than we would be
so isn't one possible unexpected outcome
that
isis and al-qaeda are degraded in
afghanistan because the taliban really
doesn't want any more trouble with the
rest of the world
they just want to run their little
fiefdom there
so anyway i'm not saying that's
necessarily likely but i don't think you
could rule out the possibility that
retreating gets us better
protection from isis k
uh
yeah i'm seeing a lot of no's yeah i
wouldn't say it's likely
but i think it's one of the
possibilities
rasmussen poll asked is afghanistan
situation better or worse than the news
portrays 57 say worse
really
because it feels like the nurse the news
is portraying it is pretty bad
this is the one situation where all of
the news is on the same side you rarely
get that right the entire news thinks
this is pretty pretty bad
here is a here's a little warning shot
for you
now
you all of course know about the
controversy of ivermectin
and
boy if you're on the side that thinks it
works
and you're wrong i don't know if we'll
ever know for sure right are we ever
going to know for sure but let's say we
could know for sure someday
if you're wrong about ivermectin it's
going to be really embarrassing
because the setup here is that
let me just say what chris eliza said on
cnn
and normally i don't agree with him and
i'm not saying i
agree with him here but the way he
worded it is is worthy of repeating
he said uh owning the elites by taking a
horse bill so i guess ivermectin is
often used as a in veterinarian work
so owning the elites by taking a horse
bill rather than getting the vaccine is
really a telling commentary on just how
much blind partisanship has taken over
among trump conservatives
telling and terrifying
owning the elites by taking a horse pill
rather than getting a vaccine
that's pretty brutal
now
what if he's wrong
what if chrysalis is the one who's wrong
well the joke's on you chris
because if it turns out that vaccines
are bad and ivormectin is great
he's gonna have a little egg on his face
except that
it won't be as easy to mock him
because he's on the same side as you
know science
so you don't want to be on the wrong
side of science
and also be promoting something that
other people can reasonably call a horse
pill
so persuasion wise
this is no longer a balanced
situation if it turns out that the chris
salizas of the world who think the
vaccination is real and good
and ivor mechna is not if he turns out
to be wrong
is still not that embarrassing for him
because he was in group he was agreeing
with the entire scientific community
not entire but you know the consensus so
if you agree with the consensus and
you're wrong it's not too embarrassing
but what happens if you take a
a radically different opinion from the
consensus and then you're wrong
not so good
right you don't want to be the one
pushing the horse pills the horse pills
if it turns out to be wrong
so one of the things you have to look at
with persuasion is who's got the bigger
downside
because we don't like downside right so
chris eliza is taking a bet
with not much of a downside if he's
wrong well so were a lot of other people
but boy if you take the eye for mectin
sided you're wrong you're the one
pushing a horse bill
because you were so partisan that you
couldn't believe the other side i guess
personally
i would say that
i don't believe
i would say every day that goes by
when ivermectin has not proven to be
effective
reduces the chances that it is because
you know i don't know one way or the
other
but i'd say every day that goes by i
would lower my odds same as i did with
hydroxychloroquine
every day that went by there when it
wasn't proven to work i said well i
think the odds are going down every day
and sure enough we still do not have
evidence it does but there's some
some high ranking
doctor and some medical association in
japan
who is saying ivor mechtin he still
doesn't know if it works
he's not saying it works he says the
evidence is ambiguous but he's promoting
it
based on the cost-benefit analysis so
that would be a big break
with
the rest of the
medical community i don't think it's
necessarily government policy it was
just the head of some medical
organization
we've got a hundred thousand people
hospitalized with covet in the united
states
we just broke last year's record
we're about at it
it's actually worse
than last year but does it seem worse
why is it worse than last year but it
doesn't seem worse well some of it's the
way it's reported right
because once again
a hundred thousand people hospitalized
how many are gonna die
isn't that really different from last
year
wouldn't it be more fair to say
ex-people died last year and this year
very very
much fewer
will die because of vaccinations and
whatever and also because
weaker people have already died so a lot
of people who could die from the
vaccines are already dead
are not from the vaccines but from the
coven
and here's a statistic that i didn't i
didn't know this
but see if you did the 48 of the us is
still not fully vaccinated
did you know that
i thought the number was much higher by
now i figured we were in a 60-plus
percentage of already vaccinated fully
but were 48
are not fully vaccinated
that feels like a gigantic number
doesn't it
wouldn't you say could you not say that
well i suppose it depends on your point
of view but
if the biden administration is trying to
convince you to get vaccinated
this is a complete failure isn't it
wouldn't you say
48
uh
not fully vaccinated looks like a
complete failure given the time and the
fact that we have vaccinations so
persuasion wise
how many people did the fake news kill
you see where i'm going with this
why do you think that so many people are
not vaccinated in the united states
i think that so many people are not
vaccinated because there's no trust
whatsoever in institutions
why is it that primarily has caused us
to not trust institutions what is the
one thing
that makes people so skeptical of
everything and maybe they should be
it's the news and it's the news dividing
everything into a partisan world and
that partisan stuff works great if all
you're doing is talking about politics
it's fun that way
but as soon as you get into a medical
discussion
and the and the the world divides into
its two camps you just killed a hundred
thousand people
right
because you divided people into
political camps so they made a political
decision on a medical decision
if you make a political
calculation on your own medical decision
you're not going to get the right
outcome you need to make a medical
decision on your medical decisions right
so
i feel as if you could make a case and i
believe that after all this is said and
done
the people are going to do all kinds of
economic studies and death studies to
find out who killed the most people
how many people did i kill
it's not zero
probably it's probably not zero
right like how many people did i
personally
kill
because of anything i said that had some
influence on somebody who made a
decision they wouldn't have made
probably not zero right because enough
people watch this
that there's probably a few people who
died of covet
and maybe they didn't need to
maybe i said something wrong i don't
know what that would be exactly but
maybe i said something wrong and kill
somebody that's very possible because
that's sort of a risk that just comes
with this kind of work but what about
what about trump
how many people did trump kill
well it depends if he was right about
stuff or wrong about stuff or if he
didn't persuade enough or he persuaded
too much on say hydroxychloroquine
but you could probably figure out how
many people he killed
or how many people he saved maybe he
saved more than he killed then you'd
look at the net
and but i would think that the biggest
kill
statistic would be the news
because the the business model the news
forces them into the two camps the two
camps make people make bad medical
decisions because they're really
political decisions they're just
dressing them up as medical decisions
and then they die
so i think the fake news probably killed
a hundred thousand people in the united
states
and do you know where you'll never see
that reported
the fake news
so that the news is the only industry
that can kill a hundred thousand people
and you'll never hear about it
the world we live in
all right
um
you may have heard that uh famous aging
porn star ron jeremy has been indicted
on
30 counts of sexual assault and a bunch
of just horrible sounding stuff
and i had this observation about context
now ron jeremy is famous for having
nearly a foot long penis
if you didn't know that
now you do
now here's how context makes a
difference
if i said to you there's a famous porn
star
with a foot long penis you'd say to
yourself well that sounds about right
sounds like he's got exactly the right
profession
indeed if i were to watch said
entertainment i would expect exactly
that exactly that
so
porn star
gigantic penis it's a really good fit
the trouble is once you retire
and you decide that you would rather
look less like a retired porn star and
you like to make a change with your
physical appearance
you know maybe exercise a little bit
less
and turn into something that looks
less like a porn star and more like a
i don't know
meth addict uh
sort of a homeless meth addict
i don't know if you've seen him lately
it's not good
he looks like a hobo who's been in a
fight
now
here's where context matters
if you've got somebody who looks like a
a hobo
on meth
and i told you that he had a 12-inch
penis
you'd be twice as scared
am i right because it just doesn't it's
not good
hey there's a hobo inside what's your
first thought
hey maybe i could give him a ham
sandwich
because it's a hobo you know maybe you'd
like to help help feed him so you go and
you make yourself a ham sandwich and you
give it to the hobo and everybody wins
but suppose i came and said to you
there's a hobo
outside your door with a 12-inch penis
would you make him a sandwich i don't
think so
i don't think he gets the sandwich
because he's a little too scary at that
point that's all i'm saying speaking of
uh huge dicks uh governor newsome
uh is looking
to be in danger
so if the recall gets 50 percent plus
one vote
he's out and the person with the next
most votes of all the competitors is in
at the moment that would be larry elder
um i was looking at larry elder's motto
and it apparently it's the one he's
settled on
which is because we have a state to save
and i'm looking at his uh his profile on
twitter because we have a state to save
what do you think
how do you like that uh as a political
motto for california specifically
because we have a state to save like it
or not
what do you say
i like it it's it's short
it's right to the point
and it doesn't you know doesn't focus on
a particular topic so here's a hypnosis
persuasion trick
if you said i'm running for governor
because we have these three problems
what do people say
well a lot of people say you know those
are not my top three problems
so i guess i don't need to vote for this
guy
but if you leave it open and you say we
have a state to save
everybody fills in the blanks with what
scares them the most
and what scares me the most might be
running out of water
what scares someone else the most might
be the forest fires or the homeless
people or drugs
so if you can if you can make people
fill in their own fear
you have freaking nailed it
so i have to say that my first
impression the first time i saw this uh
because we have a state to save
it it felt a little flat
i didn't have a little punch
but the more i look at this
it's really good
like really good i'm wondering if he had
some advice or maybe he be tested it or
whatever he did
but so that's just one thing it does
right it makes you fill in the blanks
yourself of the state to save
secondly it puts it in uh fear
persuasion territory because he's saying
the state has to be saved
so it's scary right it's not just he'll
do better he's bringing us hope and
goodness you know it's not about the
economy stupid he's saving the state
so it's a it's a fear persuasion play
and appropriate to the situation there
is a genuine fear that matches
the the public
so he's got the fear in there he keeps
it simple he matches the mood of the
public which is we're feeling the same
and
and he leaves an ambiguous so you fill
in your your best fear in there
but
did you notice the first word
because because we have a state to save
the first word is because
where have you seen that before
i call it the fake because
because
studies show that if you start something
with the word because
people think there's a reason there
and they respond to it
he actually gave them a reason
to vote for the recall and allow him in
and
and you also fill in the reason
the because
now we have a state to save tries to
hint you at the reason but you're
filling in your own reason
so you are actually talking yourself
into it
through this slogan
that's good that's like really good
it's something that allows you to fill
in your own best slogan into his slogan
i don't know if i've ever seen this
before well you know i guess you could
argue that make america great again have
that quality because you did fill in
you filled in the blanks yourself so i
but it wasn't
it wasn't fear uh stuff it was more
hopeful
all right
so the best uh i guess the best attack
against larry elder because the of
course the democrats have to come after
him
uh they've got some allegations from an
ex about
brandishing a gun
now apparently there's no
no claim that he threatened anybody
there's no claim he threatened anybody
and there's no claim
that he aimed his gun at anybody
he brandished it
so i guess there was some point where he
was you know checking the ammunition of
his gun or something while having a
conversation
and i don't know if this stuff got
conflated but i don't think it matters
and here's why
nobody believes in x
am i right
nobody believes anybody's ex
if if so if you heard somebody's ex say
that somebody brandished a gun
but no they didn't thread me with it
and no he didn't point it at me
no you know he didn't point it at me
and he didn't threaten me with it
he just brandished it
what's your first thought
 right
it it's in the category of things that
we sort of discount
a little bit because an x is always
saying about you right what do you
say about your ex
give me uh two sentences about whatever
x you x last
not so good right so nobody believes the
x if that's the best they have
i think he's in good shape
here's a question i asked on twitter
when did we stop crowing about electing
the first black
fill in the blank
the first black president the first
black
governor of california the first black
republican governor of california
don't you think
that if larry elder were a democrat
all of the news coverage on cnn would be
about oh we might get the first
black
democrat
president in california
don't you think they would just talk
about that nonstop
yeah
they would
but here you have
something more historic
what would be more historic
than a black
republican
winning in california
because you could say to yourself oh
sure you know tim scott wins
for the senate but you know i'm assuming
he has a large black base
or you could say
um sure obama won the presidency but he
had to get you know 90 plus percent of
the black vote to do it
kind of special cases
but what the hell is the special case of
a black republican in california
that's the opposite of a special case
this is like the first case
where race didn't matter
right
has that ever happened before have we
ever been in a situation where
race was erased from the conversation
larry elder just did that
this is like one of the greatest
accomplishments of any politician in the
history of the universe
think about this larry elder
took race
out of the conversation
why
because he didn't put it in the
conversation he never put it in there
so
i would say
that larry elder has accomplished
something more special than any
any politician has ever accomplished he
took race out of the conversation i mean
that's crazy
who else has ever done that
and how did he do it
he didn't do it by what he said
he did it by who he is
he did it
by living the life he lives
by being the person he is
he took it right off the table i mean
think about that who has ever done that
before in the history of politics nobody
nobody's ever done that and we're going
to ignore it
joe lonsdale asked me on twitter he said
curious why more people like you aren't
talking about the elephant in the room
that they've changed the rules in
california to send ballots ahead of time
to everyone and allow unions to go door
to door to
help millions of people with them
which makes the recall very unlikely to
pass
what do you think
do you think that the rules changes
are what elect our presidents
i think yes
we don't really live in a system
where votes determine presidents anymore
we live in a system in which the rule
changes
determine the present
so if that happens in this case
it will be a giant recall
in which
the votes didn't matter we would have
spent i don't want two years
on a recall
to find out
that the
 votes
didn't matter
and that's sort of where we might be
now i happen to think
that there is so much dislike of newsome
that the polls are misleading
i believe he's gonna i believe elder's
gonna win
and i don't think the rules changes
while significant
i don't even think the rule changes can
get there maybe i mean it might i mean
newsom's saying it's a turnout election
and he could be totally right about that
so we'll see
um
so it looks like coven is permanent now
what
what would you feel about china
if you knew that the pandemic they
released or we believe they released
what if it's permanent
how does that change what you think
about what needs to be done
if it's permanent
that feels different doesn't it it's one
thing that they you know killed 600 000
people in america
if if it passes right and it gets better
but what if it doesn't
i don't know that's there's there may be
some uh big reckoning coming here with
china
uh cnn is still using what i call the
anecdotal brainwashing technique in
which instead of reporting statistics
they report this one guy had this
problem
and then they try to persuade you that
the one guy
tells you something about the big
picture of course it doesn't
unless it's a coincidence but here here
are their uh offerings just for today
they do this every single day
uh here's headline fitness trainer
decline vaccine
stunning photos show what happened to
him
all right it's going to be a whole bunch
of
guy
didn't want to take vaccine well he's
sorry now
isn't this guy sorry there'll be one
every day i'll bet you here's another
one
uh
quote i had to turn away a cancer
patient that needed an emergency
treatment florida oncologist
dr baba perriani told cnn
same trick right there's this one doctor
who had to turn away one patient now do
you think the patient went home and died
because it was an emergency treatment
for cancer
so when he got turned away from the
hospital did he just go home and die
no
no they don't mention what happened to
him
he probably dry he probably drove an
extra five miles to another
hospital got the life saving you know
probably i mean i don't know
but i would say this is a misleading
anecdote
edward snowden is writing about apple's
new os that apparently will spy on your
photos on your phone and alert the
police if you've got a lot of bad stuff
there
i'm thinking you know various illegal
porn etc what do you feel about apple
having an algorithm that will alert the
police
based on the pictures on your phone
what do you think about that
that's pretty bad
that's about as bad as it gets
and
weirdly apple is the privacy company but
they're also the anti-porn company
so they do have two
you know branding things that are in
conflict here
and
i know i i guess it depends how what you
feel about
uh you know underage
photos on people's phones
now if you think that's the biggest
problem in the world then you'd be in
favor of this maybe if you think privacy
being eroded is a bigger problem well
you'd be on the other side
um obviously i'm not in favor of those
pictures on anybody's phones
but
you have to look at apple's privacy
situation and it looks
it does look like an overage in my
opinion it's a rare
gigantic mistake by apple
so that's my opinion i would say
gigantic mistake i would also say that i
don't think steve jobs would have done
it
because it feels like a gigantic mistake
and i think he would have felt it
because he was a little bit more
intuitive about
you know the psychology of things
apparently employees are quitting in
record numbers because they kind of
liked working remotely and the thought
of going back to work just seemed so
horrible
that
68 of job separations were people
quitting
and one in three workers this is from
media insider a tweet uh one in three
workers are considering leaving their
jobs
well sixty percent of them are
rethinking their careers
talk about a reboot
basically i think you know this is
something i tell you a lot this is
another persuasion trick
people get used to anything
so you tell people hey your commute's
gonna be half an hour and they're like i
hate that but it's half an hour and then
traffic gets worse and they're like hey
your commute is 45 minutes you're like
well it was already half an hour now
it's 45 minutes i guess i could handle
that next thing you know you change jobs
but your commute's going to be an hour
if you change jobs you're like well it
was already 45 minutes
so what's an hour
i think you can just get used to things
because they gradually happen
and i think that people realized they
had been living a nightmare
of driving two hours you know each day
to and from work just a nightmare and
when they got to work remotely they just
said i'd rather starve to death than do
this again
so i think that the
the reboot of the pandemic just changed
how people just see their whole lives
and you see it coming through the
employment stuff
um
apparently uh sydney powell and linwood
lawyers for the
about the alleged
election fraud
they were a federal judge
federal judge ordered sanctions against
them
for their uh trump-aligned lawsuits
challenging the election and i guess the
reasoning here is that there are
lawsuits who are so frivolous and
ridiculous
that they need to be sanctioned for that
now if you are
checking people's predictions
what was my prediction when i heard uh
cindy powell and then would say that
there was
that they had discovered that the
software was i don't know
uh somehow being manipulated
by it had something to do with venezuela
and all that
what did i say when you first heard that
i remember i was on trump's side
right i was on trump's side
and then i heard these claims and i said
complete
hey carrie
thanks for the buck 49
um
and
i don't know this is what i predicted so
check your predictions uh in the
comments how many
yeah
we don't know yet right so who knows
but only i'm only talking about the the
venezuela dictator stuff
that was in my opinion was obvious
 on the surface you didn't need
to wait for that that was obvious now
whether or not there's any shenanigans
in the election i think that's an open
question because we can't check
everything but in terms of the the the
biggest kraken style
things i call on day one and it
looks like that will be right how many
of you
were right or wrong about that if we
assume that there's nothing to the
venezuela part and i think that feels
safe at this point
um
uh no i'm not saying it's uh bs because
a judge said so
i'm saying that it's bs because by now
we would know if there was anything to
it
and we don't
my guess is that they were fed some
misinformation by somebody who wanted to
discredit them exactly the way it
happened
i feel like that was an intel
or somebody aligned with them something
like that there were some dirty tricks
involved in duping these two into
thinking that these ridiculous
claims had some merit
so
anyway check your check your predictions
were you right on that one or not
all right let me make sure that i've
addressed all of the fascinating things
in today's news
and did not talk too much
about those topics you hate
so
um
now that uh i've gone a few days without
talking about the forbidden topics the
ones which make you turn off this live
stream you know what they are
better or worse
give you some feedback
all right so i didn't do any uh any deep
vaccination stuff i mean you have to
mention exercises in the news but i
didn't do any deep vaccination thoughts
or any deep mass stuff
people people on uh so he says worse
well done
on the locals platform it's universally
they like it better
so it looks like 100 there
on
youtube a little a little more muted but
also it seems like
people are on the same side
you know here's the thing i want to ask
you though
i want to ask you this
you love the angry ignorant
that is
somebody said talk about vaccines more
because i love the angry ignorant uh now
i'm not sure which side you're calling
the ignorant so that's the fun part
but that is the fun of it the fun of it
had nothing to do with whether you
should do those things it was only
you know exposing people's
thought process
um
uh we need the age of those dying from
covid that is right
you know i also wonder how many people
are left
you know if if the only people who die
of covet are the you know .01 or
whatever
don't you get all of them pretty quickly
or don't you get half of them pretty
quickly i feel as if we would just burn
through the people who could be
killed by it and you just run out of
victims after a while
talk about how india beat the delta with
only four percent of x rate i don't
think that happened
most of what you
you see on internet about countries
is wrong
so i'll say most i'd say more than 60
percent i would say anything you see on
the internet
that says country x had this experience
automatically wrong
let me give you some examples of things
which are in the category of almost
always wrong you ready
you're not going to like this
i'll give you an example and you tell me
if you think that they're usually right
or usually wrong
there's a rogue doctor who made a video
saying that all the experts got it wrong
and what they're recommending is going
to make it worse for you that's all you
know
i'm not referring to any specific doctor
i'm saying there's just a pandemic
just imagine
this is just imaginary there's a rogue
doctor
and he's telling you that everybody got
it wrong
what are the odds that the rogue doctor
is right and everybody got it wrong give
me the odds
i want odds i don't want words but you
could put a number on it
all right i'm going to read some of your
numbers 90 percent to 5
20
eighty percent
look at that difference ninety five
percent five percent ten percent
five to zero zero five percent
i'll give you my estimate ninety five
percent chance it is not right the lone
doctor or the you know the the three
doctors
the any viral clip of the doctors
disagreeing with the majority
in my opinion
based on life
95
chance is
five percent chance
you really have something and if it's
that five percent it's world changing
i mean it's a big big big big deal
if they're right but 95
time they're not
um
likewise let's say you see a story about
sweden having a certain outcome
how much should you trust
the internet report of sweden oh about
any country it doesn't matter what
country is israel
india whatever country you think you
can't explain
what are the odds
that that story or the data about that
one country
is accurate and telling you something
useful
no more than five percent
everything about individual countries is
just all of it
right so those are categories of things
where you should automatically just say
well it could be and maybe we should pay
attention and if the argument is good
maybe you follow it up a little bit
but
um
dr chang says we listened to
dr chang ji we listened to sweden press
conference it's true
it's true because you listen to a press
conference
are you a chinese spy
are ya
because you look like a chinese spy to
me
um
now here's an interesting question uh at
least on the the youtube feed
how many chinese spies
um you know trolls
are following this right now
i mean i have to think i'm in the top 10
american
anti-china
persuaders so if they're not following
me i don't know who they would follow i
mean
you should be following me so i should
have some chinese trolls on there
if everything i know about everything is
right
um all right
that is all we've got for today and i'm
going to go do some other things
and i'll talk to you
tomorrow
yes i hear some voices
