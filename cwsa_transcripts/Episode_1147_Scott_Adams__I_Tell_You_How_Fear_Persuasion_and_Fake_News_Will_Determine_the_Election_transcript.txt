pleasure of the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better
everything it's called the simultaneous
hip and happiness now go
i feel all my vital signs improving
white blood count up
vitamin d levels improving
yep it's all coming together now
so what's happening in the news
apparently fbi chief
christopher wray has something to tell
us this morning
if you find out what it is
while i'm yammering away here tell me in
the comments what the news is some big
news
i saw somebody saying they thought he
was gonna resign
but i don't think that's
anything like confirmed
so we'll see could could be a whole new
news cycle could be interesting
all right here's a question
uh i wonder about whenever we talk about
death rates for coronavirus we're always
talking about averages
and the averages are useful
but they could be misleading as well and
here's what i'm wondering
how many people in trump's position
meaning they they were diagnosed early
so there was sufficient testing to
to to catch it before the symptoms were
bad
and they got the full suite of let's
call it the trump protocol
every drug that trump got
the same way that he got it and let's
say they were in their 70s and let's say
they had one comorbidity
they had some extra pounds
how many people in that situation
who were lucky enough to get treated as
well as the president which would be
rare
but we could get there
how many of those people would die
because i'm starting to think that the
number is so close to zero
that we should just forget about it
i mean if we can get to the point where
we can catch people early
and give them exactly what trump got
and whatever else comes along
i feel as if
vaccines are not going to be the answer
you know
one of my predictions i made
months ago
which i haven't i haven't
re-upped but i think i'll do it now
i'm not sure we'll ever see vaccinations
i'm just not sure vaccines are going to
be the answer
as other people have noted we've never
successfully made a coronavirus vaccine
so
are you wondering why is it we've never
been able to make one in the past
but now
you know six or ten different companies
suddenly can all make one and they can
make it all with different techniques
so suddenly
the thing that was impossible every year
until now
is now so possible that you can do it
ten different ways
there's something wrong right
there's some there's something terribly
wrong with what we're being told now
maybe
it was always possible and there was
some financial or other reason it wasn't
being done
maybe it was a timing thing maybe
those coronaviruses weren't so bad so we
didn't have to try so hard but we're
definitely not getting good information
about what's going on in the world
have you seen the latest polls
uh it looks like the polls
are starting to show biden with a
commanding lead
what do you think
do you buy it
apparently this is the same week
in 2016 relative to election day the
same week that hillary was at her
maximum poll numbers
now
does that mean that this will go the way
i went last time
well i certainly suspect
that
people are lying to pollsters first of
all
we'll see how much
um but it's also true
that this might be one of the
president's worst weeks wouldn't you say
and we also see that these numbers can
swing wildly in one week
so what it is today is really not
terribly predictive of what the election
is going to be as we know from 2016.
so i wouldn't worry
yet but if things don't change it's not
looking good
that's for sure
all right let's talk about persuasion
and the strongest
elements of persuasion to see if we can
get a little visibility on what's going
on here as i've told you before
the strongest persuasion especially for
the presidency
is fear
you could pretty much predict that
whoever does the best job of scaring
voters in the way that they want to
scare them
that's probably who's going to win the
election
fear is the big persuader it's the one
thing that'll get people off the fence
it's the one one thing that'll make you
show up to vote
and it'll certainly get you to switch
parties
if you're afraid you might not do it for
other reasons but
if you're afraid you might switch
parties
so let's look at the fear
filter
so number one fear is kovid right
so the democrats quite wisely decided to
focus on cronovirus
as the primary
you know
push against president trump it works
for two really good reasons number one
there's a general impression that he has
not performed as well as he could
so they've got something to say about
his performance now i of course have
said
that those those opinions are probably
ridiculous
it won't matter because we make
decisions based on ridiculous thinking
but my point is this
what do we know
about how well let's say a different
leader would have been in the united
states let's say if we picked
the leader of germany the leader of new
zealand pick anybody who you think did a
good job on the coronavirus
and and tell me that you know for sure
if that other leader
had just been born american
and had been the president instead of
trump
that we would have gotten a better
result
because you can't say that
it's unknowable
and if you use your common sense to just
think it through
he probably whoever that other president
would be hypothetically would probably
get the same result
because they would have the same
limitations
they would come into a administration
that faulty tests from the cdc
wasn't the president's fault
but they were faulty
you would have the states jockeying for
power we have a system where the states
have a lot of control they would be
making a variety of different decisions
just the way the system is supposed to
work that's exactly what it's supposed
to do
i don't know that some other leader
would have gotten a better result
but
the country is not good at analyzing so
they won't make that comparison they
won't know enough to say wait wait the
only thing that matters
is what another leader would have done
in the same situation as
president of the united states
it doesn't tell you anything
to know how somebody did in another
country
because they're just too many different
variables
so point is
fear is always
the big the big motivator persuasion
wise coronavirus has been our biggest
fear
and the president is vulnerable to
criticism because people aren't good at
analyzing
so they quite rightly went after this
but the president
and i don't think
i don't think this is getting enough
attention
the president's instincts to downplay
the fear of the coronavirus
is politically
probably right on point
because you might say to yourself scott
i think the country would do better
you know if people were more afraid
maybe they would take more precautions
or something
maybe that's entirely possible
but from a political perspective
if the president can take the fear off
it
he can take the criticism and it won't
hurt as much
politically
so if you are on a scale of one to ten
if your fear of coronavirus was
let's say a nine or a ten
and he can bump that down to us to a
seven
he probably wins
now what what do you feel about the risk
of the coronavirus when you see a 73
year old
73 or four
year old
man who's got some comorbidities got a
little extra weight on him
what does it make you feel when you see
him going to the hospital and shake it
off in a few days
less afraid right
now you might say to yourself well i'm
not going to get the same
you know health care as the president
but even so
when you watch him go through it you you
sort of relate to it more because it's
somebody you sort of know
and
and you feel
okay i just watched
the cycle from beginning to end
and there was nothing that happened
there
that looked extra dangerous
it could have been if he had not gotten
the right treatment etc but your
impression of it
right or wrong just your impression of
it is less scary so i think that the
president is knocking that down from a
nine or a 10
to about a seven
and you don't really see it it's sort of
an invisible play
because what people are concentrating on
is what that will do to let's say the
actions of the citizens will the
citizens then
expose themselves to greater risk than
they should because they're less afraid
they might
that's entirely possible they might
but
that will count much less
let's say that you know the the death
rate is
235 000
but it could have been
232 000
just to pick in numbers would you notice
would the public say ah
that was an extra two thousand people
if the president had just said different
things about his own infection
two thousand people would be alive well
we'll never be able to demonstrate that
anybody died because of what the
president said it just won't be
studyable
we won't know and certainly won't know
by election day
that's my dog making all kinds of noise
if you hear that
so
here's the thing
the president is doing a good job on the
fear reduction now in order to win
they've got to
amp up the fear
on the in the other direction
so right now there we don't have enough
fear about what would happen if
joe biden got elected what would be the
thing you would fear the most
well you can think of all kinds of stuff
he's like well
maybe he's a little you know too
friendly with china
but you don't feel that is going to kill
you tomorrow
it feels like some kind of long-term
you know sub-optimal situation
um
and then you say okay well he might
do something with your healthcare
but it might not affect you personally
it might take a while
maybe it would be okay it doesn't scare
you
you just have a preference
so the president needs to apply some
fear
to his persuasion or it probably won't
get done
meaning he won't win what would be the
scariest thing
that they could persuade on well street
violence and crime revolution
uh socialist taking over and destroying
the planet
so i would be
expecting that mike pence in his
in his uh
debate tonight i think he's going to be
pushing hard on the
the risk of socialism
and that would be my guess i think he's
going to push hard on how that will
destroy the country and we're all in
trouble
um
the the democrats are also doing a
better job
lying as it turns out they're telling
people that they're going to lose their
health care if if trump gets reelected
that they'll you'll lose
pre-existing conditions
there's no evidence that any of this is
true and there's evidence that is false
but
because the country is so in such
uh information poverty
you can make any claim on on the left
and it will never be fact-checked
because they don't fact-check themselves
and the people watching the news from
the left just will never see the other
argument
so the the democrats can literally just
say anything just anything
so they can push the fine people hoax as
you know they can tell you that trump's
taking your health care that he's going
to cut social security none of this is
true
none of this is based on anything
but they can just say it just put it out
there now i'm not saying that the
president isn't also making wild claims
but
i think his wild claims get fact-checked
but they don't get fact-checked on the
left
i would go for starvation as the fear
that the
that the republicans can push
um
so joe biden gave this speech at uh
gettysburg this the scene of the
gettysburg
um i'm going to talk about sweden in a
little bit i see your comment there
um and i would say that i listened to a
little bit of binding speech and i'd
have to say
high marks i give it high marks i would
say that biden
uh in terms of going to gettysburg
because it's you know a place of you
know famous for civil war national
unrest
so image-wise
pretty good
speech-wise
pretty good
you know if if i'm being objective
he did he did a solid job there i would
say
just a really good job and i thought the
content of his speech was strong as well
but as uh
joel pollock pointed out in his article
in breitbart
that he was doing a unity speech
in which he led off with the most
most divisive lie in american history
the fine people hoax
so he goes to give a speech on national
reconciliation
and he leads off
with his own bad behavior
the worst thing that's happening in the
country and that's i don't think that's
an exaggeration his lie about the fine
people hoax is the alpha
problem in the country
if you even more than coronavirus in my
opinion
because to the extent that people
believe the fine people hoax
and apparently people on the left do
that makes everything that they do okay
it's the approval
to be dangerous it's the approval to be
extreme
because they think they're fighting
something extreme
which as it turns out just didn't happen
doesn't exist
um
so but he can get away with that because
again there will be no fact checking of
his
false claims
um
let's see
there's a big story of course
which will only be
shown in the right landing media
so maybe that what would be normally the
biggest story in the country
will be non-existent on cnn and msnbc it
just won't exist
now i've told you in the past
that that's usually an indication of
fake news
fake news is usually when either only
the left or only the right report it as
even happening
and the other one just doesn't act like
it didn't happen
that usually means it didn't happen
if both of them reported happened it
probably did
if you know they might have a different
spin on what it means
but if they both at least report it
happened
probably happened
so right now we've got this
story that only exists
on the right
and may only exist there and it may
never be covered by the left
that the
the president has now
you know ordered declassification of all
of the uh
all of the russia collusion
uh stuff
now i don't know what that means
but does it really mean it's all
declassified
really all of it because most of the
stuff we've seen had redactions like
crazy
is he really getting rid of
all the red actions
so first of all i don't believe it you
know it seems like too much of a claim i
feel like there have to be redaction
somewhere
but
that's not the big story the big story
is that what's already released
shows that john brennan was aware and
must have briefed
i think he briefed obama he must have
been aware
that hillary clinton had a scheme
to detract from her own email problem
by creating a fake scandal about trump
and russia
which she did
and with the help of her you know
helpers in the department of justice and
the fbi or whatever
cia and with her helpers almost
succeeded in overthrowing the country
almost succeeded and you know what
she's almost there again
we're at the brink of hillary clinton
succeeding
in
in the coup that she attempted in 2016.
now when i say she's on the brink of
succeeding if you look at the polls it
would suggest that
the collective lies coming out of the
uh and the left
would have done their job
and that those lies collectively might
you know get bite and elected which puts
the hillary obama crowd back in charge
we don't know exactly who
but
it's starting to look
like hillary's coup attempt which is now
clearly documented in 2016
um is actually going to work
like right now
because this election
will be completely fraudulent because
none of the information the voters have
to vote on
is real
all of our information is just made up
which is fake
now of course the russia collusion thing
was fake news
that was an attempt to overthrow the
country
this is just more of that
it's just more fake news the the fine
people hoax being the prime example
it's just a whole bunch of fake news
that collectively the left gets together
and promotes
that is so strong
when you put it all together
it might actually cost trump the
election
i'm still predicting he'll win
but at the moment that's what it looks
like
so
that should be the biggest story in the
world right
not just the biggest story in the
country it should be the biggest story
in the world
won't even be covered on cnn
won't even be covered
now there's a race to the finish line
that's really interesting
because brennan and maybe some others in
the government
might be
in a whole lot of legal trouble
but only if trump gets reelected
because otherwise they can stall until
biden gets in office and then
everybody's home free
so
it looks like we have documented
evidence of an actual coup in 2016.
we have an actual coup that's in
progress right now a fake news coupe
it's it's you know the the fake news
creates
you know the the coup basically
and
and the people that we know are involved
are on a path if things go the way the
polls are indicating
they're on a path to completely get away
with it
not only get away with it but it might
be your next head of the cia
brennan could be that next out of the
cia
that's completely possible at this point
i can't think of a worse outcome
but we're we're certainly on the
precipice of that being possible
um
let's see what else we got going on here
the
the stimulus is off
and this is another example of how the
fake news
can overthrow a government
the accurate news would be like this
nancy pelosi put a bunch of things in
the stimulus bill
that anybody would have known would make
it impossible for
republicans to pass it anybody would
know that
so it's quite obvious
that nancy pelosi
knew that that bill was impossible to
pass
the way it was designed
and she wasn't going to negotiate it
which further tells you it was never
intended to be passed it was intended to
fail
so they could blame it on the president
that's right
nancy pelosi is actually starving
americans
starving starving americans for
political gain
but because they control the media so
much of it anyway
that story will turn into the opposite
of that
they can just say it's the opposite it's
the opposite it was a perfectly good
bill
and this president trump
he decided not to negotiate and walked
away so it's all on him right
of course the president has said that he
would be perfectly happy to sign a a
clean bill that just had stimulus checks
and i think one other thing
but they won't send that to him
because they can starve the public
and blame it on trump because they
control the news
amazingly
uh
yeah so
and also since the
the media doesn't understand how
negotiating works
when they see trump walk away from the
negotiating table
they say
hey
trump stopped negotiating
which is exactly the opposite of what
happened
they can report exactly the opposite of
reality and get away with it completely
when he walks away from the table
that's negotiating
that's what it is
and he's told us specifically he wrote a
book about it
walk away from the table
otherwise you can't get what you want so
he's negotiating
but the news will treat it as he stopped
negotiating
because they can they just can they just
have the power
to report things as the opposite of what
is obviously true
and they can get away with it it's
amazing
um
and of course the ignorance of the
public really helps them there
um i'm seeing more reports about that
drug that uh trump is apparently on this
dexa
dexamethasone
and some doctors are saying it has the
side effects including aggression
agitation and confusion
now
most people won't have those side
effects
but
i don't like those side effects
and i gotta say as much as i i love my
president trump
any president who has a was taking a
drug that might have those side effects
i think you have to take the
nuclear codes away from them
i really do
and i you know it's so close to a
election that i can't imagine that would
happen
but under normal conditions yeah
yeah no matter how much you love your
president
that's a pretty big risk
right i you you would find it no value
in my
commentary if i if i just agreed with
the president on everything that would
be no no use to you at all
so that's my opinion on that
here is the strangest simulation
thing
um as you know kellyanne conway has been
tested positives and as well as her
daughter
so both kelly ann and her daughter have
the coronavirus
i i was googling this morning to try to
determine if george conway
has tested positive for coronavirus
you would think that if two family
members have tested positive his odds
are pretty high
now this opens up the following
completely possible scenario
you've seen george conway right
he doesn't look
let's uh how do i i don't like the fat
shame but it's important in the story
so i'm not going to fat shame him i'm
just going to say he's got an obvious
comorbidity
what would you agree and far more i
think if i can remember what he looked
like far more than trump
and there is a non-zero chance
that trump through the coronavirus
will take out his biggest
critic
and that would be first of all tragic
i'm not i'm not hoping that that happens
i'm not a george conway fan
but we don't we don't hope illness on
anybody
we don't hope
you know we don't wish for any violence
or
any kind of bad outcomes for anybody i
hope you don't either
but in terms of the simulation
this is really possible now it's
entirely possible
that trump's number one critic
could be susceptible to this
and if it turned out that um
well if it turned out that that happened
i i don't know what i would think about
reality after that it would just be so
mind-bogglingly
looking like a movie script i just
wouldn't know what to think of it here's
another one like that
i saw a
chart of various countries opinions of
china
and if you look at you know the various
countries and what they thought of china
over the years it's you know up and down
but
about
2018 the dislike of china just went
through the roof
so every
every country in the world just had a
big change around 2018
boom
now here's the simulation part of that
okay
and i know i know from experience
that at least a third of you are going
to misinterpret
what i say next
so
i'll just let that happen because i
can't help it i can only say this as
clearly as i can
knowing that a third of you will
permanently misinterpret it goes like
this
in 2018 my stepson died of a of a
fentanyl overdose fentanyl of course
comes from china and they do it
intentionally to hurt the united states
at that time
i declared that china was my mortal
enemy and i was going to take them down
or
certainly try as hard as i could
so exactly the time that i publicly
announced i was going to take down china
and destroy their
reputation first
their reputation just fell off a cliff
and all over the world people were
hating china now i'm not going to say
and here's the part you'll misinterpret
i'm not claiming i did that
a third of the people listening will go
go away and say he just claimed he did
that
i'm just
i'm telling you i'm not claiming that
i'm claiming it as a coincidence
but it's a big one
and
by itself it wouldn't mean anything
right because a lot of people probably
turned a negative on china around the
same time
so if you just looked at it in isolation
wouldn't mean much
but i got to tell you the number of
times in my life
that i've
you know picked a desirable uh global
thing to happen
and then watched it happen just when i
decided it should happen
is really freaking me out a little bit
just a little bit
so the point of the story is not that
i'm changing world events it's that i
don't understand why they change when i
want them to
am i
just good at guessing what will happen
i'm genuinely confused by it because it
happens so regularly you know someday
i'll give you the list of things
that happened just about the time i
started persuading that direction
i feel like
somebody says breaking news
is something breaking right now
tell me in the uh
tell me in the comments if you see
something
um
somebody says hey
you costed i know you did well i don't
make that claim but i will tell you that
i was trying to make exactly this happen
and at the time you would have said it
would be unlikely wouldn't you
if in 2018 when i said publicly as i did
a number of times
that i was i determined that china was
my enemy and i was going to try to take
them down
you probably didn't think much would
change did you
you probably thought
2020 would look a lot like 2018
in terms of china you probably wouldn't
think much would be different
except we're decoupling and
there's a lot different
there's a lot different
but i don't take credit for that all
right
facebook has decided to ban
q anon across all of its platforms
what do you think of that
do you think it's reasonable for
facebook
to ban q anon based on the fact that
they spread i guess this would be their
argument that they spread untruths
that presumably are you know potentially
dangerous untruths
do you think that's reasonable
here's what i think
it might be reasonable
i i could totally see how it would be
reasonable to remove
conspiracy theory bs
from your platform
but
don't you have to be a little consistent
that's my only issue
why can they allow
joe biden
to to base his campaign on an obvious
falsehood
the fine people hoax when you just have
to look at the transcript to know that
it's not true
just look at the transcript it's that
easy now why is it
that the most divisive and dangerous
hoax in the history of america that's my
claim for the fine people oaks the most
dangerous hoax in all of american
history
why is that okay
now
you could say well
you know it's a political claim and
there's lots of political claims and we
can't really fact check all that and
people will just put it in context it's
just a political claim
is it
i would say no
here's here's a political claim
president trump will cut your social
security it's not true
it's the opposite of what he says he'll
do and he's been pretty good about doing
what he says he'll do
and not doing what he says he won't do
he's been pretty good at that so it's
not true
is that okay is it okay to have
something that's clearly not true
that's a political claim i would say
probably that's okay
because
as soon as you get into the business of
determining what's true and not
you it's just a forever rabbit hole you
can't get out of that hole right because
you know there's lots of things that are
gray area
some people could say it's true some
people would say it's not true you could
never really use that standard
of that it's true or not true you'd have
to use the standard
that is not true and on top of that
it's dangerous
i think that's what put q anon over the
top
not that it's untrue
but it's that it's untrue and has
a fairly obvious potential for for
danger
that's what define people hoax is
the fine people hoax isn't just
something that's untrue it's not like
saying i'll raise your taxes it's not
like saying i'll cut your social
security it's not like saying
you know although you can keep your
doctor
yeah it's not like any of those things
those are just untrue
they're not dangerous
the fine people hoax
could get me killed
me personally
i could get killed
because of that hoax and all that it
supports because it supports a whole
structure of beliefs
that you know i think that's the the
strongest pillar and it's not real
so that's the world you live in all
right so i think facebook just needs to
be consistent
i wouldn't mind them banning q anon
uh if they also banned the fine people
hoax
i would say those are equivalents
um
interestingly a fellow named glenn
lowery who's a scholar
he's got together with a bunch of other
scholars
and they're calling for the pulitzer
board to revoke the pulitzer prize
awarded earlier this year
to nicole hannah-jones for her 16-19
project
and they're asking for the pulitzer
prize to be revoked
because the scholarship in that piece of
work
is lacking
meaning that there's a claim in there
that's ridiculously untrue
specifically the claim that the american
revolution was fought in large part to
preserve slavery
apparently there's no
historical evidence that that was the
case
but that's that's part of the learning
and somebody got a
pulitzer surprise for that completely
false claim
uh of course you're all going to watch
the vp
um debates tonight
i think the vp debate is going to be
more interesting
than you think might be more interesting
than you think
um of course the big drama is that
kamala harris is going to ask for a
plexi glass walls and pence is
wants to have no wall
now if it turns out that kamala is in a
plastic glass box
and pence is not
who wins
who wins
does kamala harris win because she's the
one playing it safe and she's got her
little plexiglass cubicle
or does pence win
because he's clearly far enough away
from people to not infect anybody but
he's also not being a little in a
plastic box
who wins
well it might depend you know people
will pick sides with their political
favorite i think pence wins that
in terms of the optics you don't want to
be the bubble girl
all right
if pence is a free-range chicken on that
stage
and kamala harris is a bubble girl
bubble girl does not beat free-range
chicken in optics it's not even close
all right so i don't know if it'll turn
out that way one's in a bubble and one
isn't but bubble girl doesn't have an
advantage
now here's the other stuff
the first thing you need to know about
vice president debates
is that that's a good place to test out
messages
so what you might see is uh you might
see pence
framing one of the issues or more in a
way that you haven't seen before
which would be really interesting
because if you see that it means he's
testing it because that would be a
normal procedure you let the vice
president test it if it doesn't work
you just don't do it yourself
if it becomes a big controversy and it's
a problem
then the president could say well that
was the vice president you know just
listen to me and sort of make it go away
because that's typical too
vice presidents do sometimes say
something that the top of the ticket has
to
has to modify
fairly ordinary i think it's happened in
a lot of different races
so
it's a it's a low risk thing for pence
to try on a new argument so see if he
does that
and here's what's uh interesting and
i've said this a number of times and i'm
just going to keep saying
i think
pence is the most underrated
public servant
in america
the most underrated in terms of how good
he is
because
the job of the vice president is
primarily not to cause trouble right you
don't want to become a problem you just
want to be a steady spare tire and i
think he does that better than just
about anybody's ever done it
i think that he stays out of trouble
like nobody's business
he also can win debates
i believe he was considered the winner
of his tim kaine debate in 2016. he's
good at it he's excellent
in in public
you know he's not going to have a weird
gaffe
you know he's going to be prepared you
know he's going to present well you know
he's not going to have a an emotional
flip out moment you know he's strong
enough to handle whatever is
coming he is really solid
now do you know that about kamala harris
would you say to yourself yeah i know
kamala harris is just as strong as all
those things i said about pence
nope
she could have some moments so she is
capable of moments you know to to
capture the news cycle and that could be
dangerous but she's not in his class
he's he is just
a better debater
and if i were her i'd be a little bit
worried because people are going to look
at the vice presidential debate a little
bit harder than they would normally
because people are looking at kamala as
maybe the top of the ticket
think about
this pence
could
i'm not predicting this because this
would be an unlikely outcome
but he could
he could he could end the election
tonight
that's possible
here's how he'd have to do it he would
just have to expose kamala and just
destroy her and eviscerate her in the
debate
if he does that
suddenly joe biden doesn't look like
such a good package because you've
always thought
all right really it's about the number
two
right if he destroys number two
he destroys number one
that wouldn't be true the reverse if
pence were to lose the debate
what's anybody going to say really
you know are you going to say therefore
i change my vote
nope
you're not going to change your vote
so first of all it's very unlikely he's
going to lose
it'll be a tie
or he'll win
i would say that's a fair estimate but
he might win and this is the thing i
don't think people are counting on
he has the skill
he does have the skill
compared to kamala harris
to eviscerate her
now
probably not i think she'll rise to the
challenge and usually these things look
closely even even if you think somebody
won
but he does have the talent
he has the talent to completely take her
out and then and i don't think the risk
works in the other direction in this
case
so if he exposes her as unusually weak
could change the race we'll see
um
have you noticed let me just do a little
uh recap here on
oh i want to talk about sweden before we
do that
so i was looking at a tweet by uh i
don't know how to pronounce his name
yainan
weiss i think
yennan or yainan
and he showed some graphs
about showing sweden compared to some
other countries uk france and spain
and the the point he was making is that
sweden is doing great in terms of death
rate and infections so very low
and i think trending down
whereas there are at least three
countries he mentioned and the us i
think you threw in there too so uk
france and spain where they're having
you know more infections now his point
was the sweden has essentially stopped
the lockdown they've gone back to
something closer to normal
and he's saying that
sweden is doing great
doing none of the things that the
countries that are doing poorly
feel they need to do like the lockdowns
and the masks and stuff
now i don't first of all i don't think
the sweden story is that clean i think
that the swedes are wearing masks and i
think that they are voluntarily socially
distancing
so it's not really a clean comparison
but
he makes he tries to make this case
and i am not convinced and here's why
number one every every time you see
somebody say i'm gonna compare one
country no matter what country
to these three or four or five countries
you can just forget what they're saying
because nothing they say is useful
if out of all the countries in the world
i don't know 180 whatever there are if
you're going to take six of them
and say i can tell something from these
six that's probably not true
it's probably cherry picking if you
would pick other countries you might get
a different result so first of all
anytime you see a coronavirus graph
with three or five countries
don't believe anything you see on that
graph
that is cherry picked data it might be
true
but you shouldn't assume it's true
because it's non-credible by design just
a few countries so
but here was uh in part of his twitter
thread
he had this little throwaway line he
said and yes
other nordic countries did better than
the swedes
what
wait a minute his point was that sweden
is doing a great job without the
lockdowns and the masks but he compared
it to uk france and sweden but then in
the tweet he throws in this line yes
other nordic countries did better than
the swedes
but that is not proof lockdowns work
because the other nordic countries did
the lockdowns
it may just be proof that the swedes
should have protected their nursing
homes better
maybe
here's my take
in other words the nordic countries
the ones that supplement with vitamin d
all year round because they don't get
enough vitamin d
so apparently in sweden it's typical to
take you know fish oil
on a daily basis to get your vitamin d
is that true in the uk do people in the
uk supplement with vitamin d don't think
so
france
nope spain
don't think so
so
here's what i see
i see that when yainan weiss was trying
to make the case
that the mass and lockdowns don't help
that much because sweden is doing well
that's not the story i saw
i looked at his own tweet thread and
said um
there's more evidence in your own tweet
thread
that the vitamin d levels are the main
or the main thing
because if it's true that it doesn't
matter if you have a mask or a lockdown
or not
you get wildly different results
but that the people who do well all seem
to be the vitamin d supplement people
is that a coincidence
is that a coincidence it could be so the
first thing you should say to yourself
is yes scott
that could be a coincidence
it totally could be a coincidence
but
what i'm saying is that all of the other
correlations or causations that you
imagine you see
don't believe them they're just not
credible is the vitamin d correlation
incredible no
no
not based on the little bit of data that
i just mentioned it's not credible at
all
but
it's not less credible
than the idea that masks and
lockdowns don't work
and then sweden is telling you that
all right
how many of our stories today
uh
stories in the news are based on just
lies
all right let's go through them
so we've got the coronavirus situation
which you know that that's been
filled with lies we've got the uh
russia collusion thing and who's behind
it
that's filled with lies it's all about
lies
we've got the stimulus deal being off
but the stimulus deal was never really
being negotiated it was a lie that it
was ever being negotiated because it
wasn't so that's just a lie um
see what else uh
facebook is banning q anon because those
are lies
uh the pulitzer prize
might get revoked or at least some
scholars are asking for it
because
the
the document that got the pulitzer prize
had a big lie in it
do you see a pattern yet
the pattern is pretty clear
all of our biggest problems
are based on the fact that we don't have
a credible
news
media anymore
as soon as your news source becomes
completely non-credible
then all of your news becomes
it's just all
every one of our problems
is
but the problem is real
but what people are saying about it is
just just not true
all right
um
somebody says that i'm conflicted about
kamala because she's my creation
see you get blocked for saying stuff
like that because that's a mind mind
reading thing
so hold on a second
i have to move something in order to
block you
yeah it's not worth it i'll block you
next time
i'll catch you next time so uh if if
that confuses you the the blocking is
when you uh
when you ascribe opinions to me that are
inaccurate you can ask me my opinion
and you can certainly criticize my
actual opinion but when you assign an
opinion to me that i do not hold and
then criticize it
you get blocked
um
depends somebody's saying pence is more
disciplined than trump i think that's
true that's that's true
he's more disciplined less interesting
all right um that is all i have for now
and i will talk to you
periscopers
tomorrow
and you youtubers
still with you you look at your comments
here as we
close up
um
is anybody enjoying the youtube
experience better so you might have
noticed i took out my
um my air pods that i was using for a
microphone
i i'm not seeing anybody
oh somebody's saying the sound is
echoing okay that's what i was going to
ask so you should hear a little echo let
me give you a little update on the sound
because so many of you have asked for it
now people have said to me scott you
should upgrade your sound system
yes
yes i should
i've got
every kind of sound device you could
possibly think of i've got a whole rack
of iron sound equipment i've got
i've got this
i've got
i've got this
and all this
and here's what i've learned because
i've experimented with all of this stuff
if you do the super end stuff like the
shure microphone and the sound boards
etc you can make that work but only if
you have a soundproof room because this
kind of microphone will pick up too much
room noise and you get way too much
the the preferred um method which i just
bought um i bought another lavalier to
use that the lavalier when it clips on
doesn't give you the full richness
of the the high-end sound system with a
soundproof room but you can use this in
a non-soundproof room without the echo
so on periscope the sound is pretty good
it's not as good as the the best that
could be but it's fine
and
i had to order a second one of these
so that i could use it with youtube so
here's the bottom line the sound will be
different in a few days on youtube
without the echo
um
and i think that will be the best it
could be i have tried
for four years
every possible
sound and video combination and this is
what i've learned
you can't beat the video from an iphone
or an ipad so this is just my iphone
that you're you're watching right now
it's it's the best video uh if you get
any kind of high-end camera
you can get a better video but the
complexity of a high-end camera because
you have to run it through other
equipment and other software
it basically makes it completely
unusable
because you can get it to work
but the very second time you want to you
want it to work some software will need
updating something went off something
time down it just never works twice
so
the iphone or the ipad is the number one
way to get a clean uh video that works
every time but to get the sound
uh like i said i've purchased expensive
sound boards
such as
this one
such as this thing
and you know i've learned to use it i've
hooked it all up i've got ever i've
soundproofed a room you know different
room in the house i've tried every
combination of microphones and the best
kind you know i'm buying some pretty
high-end stuff
and nothing works as well
as a 20
plug-in lavalier microphone on an ipad
nothing comes close
now i could come close
if i had a full-time engineer
and a a room that was designed for sound
and then this high-end equipment and
then the engineer troubleshooting it
every day because you have to
troubleshoot it every time you use it
all right so i just thought i'd give you
that uh update and i will talk to you
tomorrow
