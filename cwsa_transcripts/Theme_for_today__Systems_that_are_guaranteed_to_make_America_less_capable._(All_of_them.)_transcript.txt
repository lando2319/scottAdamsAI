early today did anybody notice that do
you know why it's an hour
early cuz I'm really bad at telling
time and so it's not supposed to start
for another
hour I looked at the clock and it was
like 10 minutes before the top of the
hour and I said to myself oh I'm
late I quickly I quickly signed up or
signed on but this is not the show so
thanks for those of you who uh hung
around waiting for this uh this blue
ball experience
here have I ever told you about my
calendar
problem I don't know if this is related
to that but I have the toughest problem
determining what date it
is all right I'm going to sign off and
I'll do the real one in uh 10:00 a.m. on

accidentally think this that this was
time to go no Look Away you did not see

dream you were never here all right I'll
see you guys at the real
time
