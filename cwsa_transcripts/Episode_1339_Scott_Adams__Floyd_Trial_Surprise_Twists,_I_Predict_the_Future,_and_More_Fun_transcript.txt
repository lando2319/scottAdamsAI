hey everybody
running it's time time for coffee with
scott adams the best part of your day
every single time still alive
yes i'm still alive i went to get my
vaccination yesterday
but it didn't work out for me i'll tell
you about that in a minute
now what would you need to do to make
this the best
day ever well part of it is having the
simultaneous
zip and all you need is a copper mug or
a glass a tanker jealous or stein a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid have i
mentioned i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes everything better come
on come on come on
grab your cup it's time now
ah i think we nailed the simultaneity at
that time
better than usual really yes
so i'd say your day is getting off to a
good start isn't it
so yesterday after weeks of waiting
for my first vaccination shot
the closest place i could get one was
about an hour away
in heavy traffic but i thought to myself
nothing will stop me nothing will stop
me from driving an hour across down
getting that jab i'm gonna take the
chance
and then i did something that you should
never
do before you go to get a vaccination
i'm gonna give you a little bit of dare
i say
medical advice and it goes like this
before you leave the house to get your
vaccination
don't do what i did don't be like me
do not do this huh i think i'll see
what's on twitter before i uh
yes the very last tweet i looked at
before i walked out the door
by coincidence was somebody who
allegedly got the shot and dropped dead
within hours
now given that tens of millions of
people
are getting these vaccinations and that
they're being targeted primarily
in the early days at the people most
vulnerable
weren't there going to be a lot of
people dropping dead after the
vaccination
no matter what because a lot of people
drop dead
and if millions of them are getting
vaccinations
some of them are going to drop dead
pretty soon after getting a vaccination
doesn't necessarily mean the vaccination
didn't but
if it's the last thing you see before
you leave for your vaccination
your experience might go like mine i
drive an hour
i get there and when i get there it's a
big fair grounds parking
lot with you know massive operation and
a guy waves me over and i drive up
and he and he says to me what county are
you from
so i guess depending on your county you
got a different line
and so i said alabita he was standing
right here
i mean he was sort of this far away and
he said
but what county are you in and i said
alameda and he looked at me and he said
but what county and i looked to him and
said
alameda. and he looked at me and said
but what county and i said
alameda and then he said
what's that line over there now i don't
know why that conversation happened that
way
i just know that it did and so i looked
at the line and i said
whoa there's a lot of cars in that line
so it was a line of cars but i said
i don't know how long that line is but
i'll go to the end of it and see how it
goes
so i pulled down the block to find the
end of the line and
turns out it continued around the corner
so i turned the corner and kept looking
for the end of the line
and then it turned a corner again and
then i looked to the end of the line
and i couldn't see it the the line for
alameda looked to be about two hours
would be my guess about two hours
and uh i didn't have gas
in my car and i can't go four hours
without using a restroom because this
looked like it was gonna take a while
you know plus you gotta wait after you
get it and stuff so i turned around and
went home
so will i be
like that person who missed the flight
and is glad he did or am i going to die
because i didn't get the vaccination
one of those two things could happen or
none of it will make any difference at
all
that's also possible but in my case it
didn't really make any difference if i
got the vaccination
unless christina got it about the same
time
and she's not eligible yet being so
young
i gotta tell you though i wanted an
extra week or two
to just see what's coming out lately
because it feels like there's some more
stuff coming out lately
kind of like another week or two to see
but i tried to make another reservation
and i can't do it
so i'm eligible for it but i can't find
a way to get a vaccination in my county
that i could actually do so i'll try to
work on that
but i don't know how dumb people do this
i honestly don't
how do dumb people just navigate this
situation
i'm pretty smart got a lot of
capabilities
i got computers and internet and all
that i can't figure out how to get a
vaccination
now you're going to say scott scott
scott
i don't think this could be much easier
look at this website
follow the link you just put in your
town and you put in your eligibility and
it just tells you where to get it
it's as simple as that well don't you
think i tried that
i tried that here's how that goes put in
all your information
put in some more information put in a
little more information
now about some more information now
we'll tell you where you can get the
vaccination
you can get it as cvs right down the
street from you
perfect that's this is a good website
gave it my information it told me the
store is right down the street
bam click on the store no vaccinations
available
at all not like in a long time
just none so go back
put in your information pick another
store finds out
no vaccinations so there's not actually
even a website that helps you
because you can find places that don't
have it
in fact it's literally a database of
places you can't get it
that's it it's literally a database
where you put in all your information
and it tells you all the places that
you're not going to be able to get
anything
here's another place you can't get a
 well i'll put in a little more
information
oh here's another place you can't guess
yet
that's very helpful all right i would
like to predict
the headline for next week are you ready
for this
i made a lot of predictions some
some good some bad but this one i'm
feeling good about
are you ready seeing into the future now
into the future everybody
please calm your thoughts this helps me
looking into the future one week from
now
headline on cnn and maybe other major
news outlets will be
experts concerned about a new
wave of infections there you go
next week's headlines experts are
concerned
about a new wave of infections
anybody want to make a bet make a bet
come on yeah you're not going to bet
against that are you
well if i were to ask you what would be
the most
perfect headline for a story something
with that when you read the headline
it doesn't make you unhappy that would
be good right most headlines make you
happy
or unhappy so you'd want a headline that
was so perfect it didn't make you
unhappy
but it just made you think oh
you know that feeling oh here's the
headline this is a real headline
i'm not making this up
elon musk's partner says he could build
the real jurassic park
with genetically engineered dinosaurs
that is what i wanted to hear today do
you know what i wanted to hear when i
woke up
please dear god somebody tell me that
they can make a jurassic park with
genetically modified dinosaurs
which is by the way better than
actual dinosaurs the real jurassic park
the real one the real movie jurassic
park
they try to revive actual dinosaurs
which i feel is sort of the loser way to
do this
once you've got your genetic engineering
up and running and you can
mate your genetic freaks uh as elon
musk's
partner in i guess neurolink
um he says you could build a better
dinosaur
why would you build a traditional
dinosaur when you can build like a
a turbo dinosaur with you know freaking
lasers on its hat or whatever it is
so i don't know what could make me
happier
nothing could make me happier than
elon's musk elon musk's partner
because you know he's smart right if it
was just some dumb guy
you wouldn't care but uh can't wait for
that
on joe rogan's recent podcast in which
he was talking with dan crenshaw
my name came up in a discussion of the
simulation theory
and i wanted to add to add a little bit
to that
the first thing i would like to note is
that i can't remember
another time when somebody mentioned my
name in public
without adding the dilbert guy
something's happened in my life or
career that my name can be mentioned in
public without adding
the dilbert guy and people will still
you know have a good chance of knowing
uh what they're talking about so one of
the things dan crenshaw said is that
whether or not the simulation theory is
true or false or independent of its
reality
what good is it like what would it do
for you
what would be the functional purpose of
believing we're in a simulation
it's a good question right because if
it's just something that happens in your
brain and
you don't make any different decisions
nothing's different
it's as if it's you don't even need to
talk about it which is
an interesting point but i would uh
i would submit that
a belief in the simulation if you can
call it belief
because it's more of a statistical risk
management situation in my opinion
um that you would i think you would act
differently
and here's why let me give you an
example do you know the story of the
four minute mile
it used to be believed that no human
could ever run a mile
in less than four minutes and everybody
who tried failed
and then one day somebody did it
one day somebody broke the four minute
mile and as soon as one person did it
lots of people broke it was it bob hayes
somebody saying you have the right name
uh i have allergies not a cold
somebody's asking me
and
so after the four minute mile was broken
then other people
broke it too and the the thinking i'm
not sure if this is true
and might have been they were just just
better training
in those days but the thinking was that
it was a sort of a psychological barrier
somebody says roger bannister
i'm seeing different names here
so i don't know who was giving me that
other name but right it looks like uh
oh now i'm seeing john walker roger
bannister
it doesn't matter who it was you can
google it
i'm seeing a lot of different names for
that that's interesting
but here's why i think it's important to
think of the
your reality as a simulation number one
if we are a simulation could we steer
our reality meaning that could you
influence your subjective reality
more easily if you were a simulation
than if it was something like a
traditional reality where you just
you know you're subject to the law of
laws of physics
but in a simulation you wouldn't be you
would be in the sense that code is part
of physics
but you would be able to do anything in
a world in which software was your
conscious experience so the first thing
is
could you use affirmations or any other
technique
to to change your subjective reality
which is the only one you experience
so that's the first thing and
nextly would you feel the same would
your
subjective experience of your life be
different if you thought you were in a
simulation
well one thing it it would do is make
you wonder if some people are npcs
right now that might be bad because you
might think well they don't have
souls or something like you do but
here's
here's a uh here's what i think is the
most important part
of thinking you're in a simulation
and that is prediction i feel as if
if this is a simulation that we would be
able to predict
some things and i made it i've made
predictions before based on the
simulation and they happen
freakishly um consistently
which doesn't mean we're in the
simulation it's just an experience i
have right it's not
science so let me give you an example
um i have noticed a pattern in my life
that my actual life plays like a video
game
meaning that i get one problem after
another
in a very consistent schedule the moment
i
solve any big problem in my life see if
this is true for you
the moment i solve any big problem
the new one cues up as soon as you
celebrate it
like it might be a few hours but right
after you solve a big problem
a new one takes its place have you ever
noticed that
and you say to yourself that can't be a
coincidence
because if problems came in randomly
sometimes you would have 15 problems
sometimes you wouldn't have any
how long do you ever go without a new
fairly substantial problem just showing
up on your doorstep
it's just hours right is it just me
so i've started to actually conceive of
my actual life as a video game
and then i see all right how consistent
is it to being programmed i'm sorry
a lot of people are saying yes in the uh
comments you're having the same
same experience okay i'll tell you so
last night
christina and i went out to dinner
finally can you go out to dinner
and we were having this amazing dinner
we had you know incredible night it was
just wonderful
and we were sort of celebrating that you
know
one other of a million problems had just
been
defeated so we were and while we were
celebrating
i said to her you know if this is a
video game which it feels like it is
then our new problem will arrive
sometime tonight
because you never wait long after one
gets solved and it did
it did it came right on schedule came
out of nowhere
it was something i'd never even heard a
hint of
now is it solvable yes it is just like
the last
problem it's a whole series of large
you know large meaning you're really
going to have to put some put a little
muscle
into getting past it but completely
solvable
somebody says i jinxed it i'm not sure
jinx is the thing
but uh when when you see how
how consistent your challenges are
like scheduled it just doesn't look like
an accident
it looks like you entered a game and you
had a series of challenges and you're
trying to accomplish something
you know i told you before that you know
my life is the strangest
life you've ever seen i mean the the
number of times
well let me ask you you've probably seen
it yourself have you ever noticed
how many times i'm at the center of
national stories
in the comments i want to see if anybody
else has noticed have you noticed how
often
it just feels like this weird
coincidence doesn't it
just a weird coincidence that i'm at the
middle
of a whole bunch of national stories now
do i do i say hey there's a national
story
i'm going to go get involved in that not
really
not really i mean i'm interested in a
lot of things
and i get involved in a lot of things
but i'm not pursuing that objective
but it does seem to happen the number of
times i turn on tv
and there's some big story and there's
somebody i just talked to
you know somebody i just texted and now
they're on tv in the middle of a
national story
all the time almost every day or at
least every week i would say
so i can't explain that my life seems to
defy any statistical observation
by a lot all right
um so that's the bottom line if we're a
video game
and you tell yourself that you're
playing against a bunch of uh
tests and your reward is to get to the
next level and it feels like
that's what my life feels like i feel
like i keep getting to the next level
and what that did was it removes your
stress
because if you think you live in a
simulation that's a video game
and you're trying to solve these little
puzzles you say oh this is a video game
i'll solve this little puzzle
that feels different than i have a
gigantic problem
oh another gigantic problem so if you're
processing your
experience as a bunch of gigantic
problems
as opposed to a game that has a bunch of
puzzles
how do you feel well you feel a lot
better
if you think you're playing a game and
your experience will probably look
just like you did at least mine has
uh check out decentral land
many of you have been uh suggesting that
so i think i probably will check that
out i'll google it i swear
i always talk about the floyd trial
if you read cnn's coverage the
prosecution
ripped apart the defense and it's all
over because
everybody that the prosecution talked to
says
there's no doubt about it what officer
chauvin shaven did uh killed george
floyd and there's no doubt about it
so that's how cnn covers it what do you
think is a reality
well it's not what cnn says that's for
sure
here's closer to the reality
apparently yesterday was the day the
prosecution got to
show some evidence that hadn't shown
before and the
it's a day when the uh defense doesn't
get as much
um let's say as much time
and as much ability to introduce their
own evidence
so basically it was the prosecution's
day to present a case
and what do i tell you happens every
time
lawyers are involved and lawyer one
presents a case is it convincing
yes whichever lawyer is talking today
is going to be convincing so when nelson
was initially having his day was he
convincing
yeah yeah he was convincing
it looked like fentanyl was the problem
and that's the end of the story he had
experts and the experts testified and
what else is there to say
reasonable doubt all over the place but
then the prosecution talks and the
prosecution brings in
its experts and they apparently are
experts
and those people say nope it's a
100 clear at least to these experts
the fentanyl had nothing to do with it
because they could look at the video
and they could determine the the
breathing pattern for
the video and they could know the timing
of things and there was a
leg kick that means you know maybe your
last gasp or something
and they they looked at you know
positions and
angles and they they looked to some
documents
and they concluded that there's no way
that this was a fentanyl death because
his breathing wasn't consistent with
a fentanyl death etc
so so what do you think
so the prosecution just put on a case
that had experts saying
there was nothing here except the
officers actions
and they should have probably should
have known better are we done
are they are they convicted no
it always looks like a slam dunk you're
done
no matter which lawyer talks i've told
you this 100 times
so whatever you're feeling about it
today doesn't mean too much
um here are the facts that
um seem relevant to me at this point
um we now have the the autopsy
that said the fentanyl level was high
enough to kill him
but other experts who looked at video
and other evidence and said uh
you know probably wouldn't have and that
it didn't
so we have now a disagreement about
whether fentanyl killed them or not
now i think the autopsy or chief
examiner or whatever is going to be
talking today
so the side that says fentanyl was
potentially just potentially a cause
will be cross-examined i believe so
so today's going to be maybe maybe the
most important day
could be the most important day um
but here's here's a here's a point from
uh legal insurrection
which is if you are the police officers
and you're in the middle of doing what
you're doing and the crowd is around you
you're distracted uh floyd is big and
dangerous and he was just
or they could have thought and he was uh
you know just resisting rest and you've
got
all these variables going on they didn't
really have the same
luxury or even training as the experts
so would it be important that the
experts were sure
the cops were doing something wrong but
the experts had all different
information because they're watching it
after the fact and
they can watch it in slow motion and
different angles and everything
so what the experts has had was the
luxury
of no distraction they could just dig
down and find out what's real
plus the luxury of being experts
which these police officers did not
share this medical expertise
the police officers being blamed for
their actions either intentionally
killing him which is not really the
charge
but rather putting him in a situation
where they should have known it was
dangerous
i believe that the experts for the
prosecution
have proved in the following if you were
also an expert
and if you were not in the middle of the
situation and
if you were not the police officer
worried about the crowd
and if you did not have 15 things in
your head trying to keep it going
and if you had been trained in a way
that you weren't trained you might have
had the same opinion as the experts
meaning that you would have handled it
differently
but there's no evidence been been
presented
yet that the police officers had any
training
that would map to what the experts have
in other words
the experts kind of made a case
that you'd have to be an expert to know
that floyd was in danger
do you feel that yet the experts proved
you would actually have to be an expert
to know that the guy was going to die in
that situation
if you were trained as a cop you
wouldn't know that
you wouldn't know that now when nelson
and i don't think he's
he's got his teeth into this yet i think
he's got a
shot coming up when nelson gets a hold
of this
i think he's just gonna eviscerate it
i mean i think a very strong prosecution
case is strong in the sense that the
experts
said exactly what the prosecution wants
you to say but they also proved that
you'd have to be an expert to know it
i feel like that's the end of the case
isn't it now is this the second or third
time that the prosecution
has made the the defense's case for them
i believe the prosecution just made the
defense's case
you would have had to be an expert to
know the difference
that's it that's the end of it isn't it
am i wrong now of course i'm wrong in
the sense that
until the court is over until the trial
is over you don't know what evidence has
been presented or how well
and there could be plenty of twists and
turns
let's see
here's another question i have does it
matter
in terms of the prosecution as long as
the police officers were following
procedures
as long as the police were following the
procedure and i believe that the
testimony is that they were
according to the trainer as long as they
were doing what they were trained
do they have any liability i just it's
just a question
now i suppose beyond their training if
they saw something that
any person would have known was a
problem then yes of course
but if they were consistent with their
training and they did not have
expert ability which you might have
needed to know there was an extra
problem
i feel like the case is over and then i
have another question
this this latest expert was testimo
testifying
that i think pressure on the back of
george floyd is what caused him to
lose his ability to breathe now isn't
the case
that shaven had his neck his knee on the
neck area
so didn't did not the expert
prove that the only person there who
could not have killed him
was shaven because he wasn't on the back
that's their case
their case is that he was on the neck
their own expert said it was the back
pressure
you know plus the position you know plus
other variables
but the back position and the pressure
on the back is what killed them
that wasn't shaven that was the other
cop
am i wrong do i have that wrong wasn't
it the other cop who was on the back
so i feel like the prosecution just made
the defense's case
or at least you know put enough doubt
about which police officer was involved
in what way
if i were the jury i'd be i'd be kind of
confused right now
there's also the idea that the crowd
killed floyd not intentionally but
because they were the distraction which
made it impossible for the police
officers to do their job
because apparently their training
requires them to secure the area and
take care of their own safety before
they even deal with somebody who's in
trouble medically
that's actually the procedure and so the
the crowd
you could call them the mob i see
somebody saying that
uh the crowd is complicit
they created the situation that made the
the police officers
far less able to notice something that
maybe you wanted them to notice
secondly how could the drugs not be part
of the cause
and if they're part of the cause isn't
that the end of it too
like how how could how could the drugs
just
not be part of any of it because i i
can't imagine
any amount of serious drugs in your body
that you had just ingested
to not have any effect because fentanyl
is
something that affects your breathing i
mean if you had a little bit in there
now the big question is whether floyd
had enough in his body
to be part of the um problem the expert
said he didn't look like he
he was in it but there's some ambiguity
about whether you could tell
you could really tell if he looks like
he's on fentanyl and then there's a
timing question
because if we don't know this for sure
but if he put some fentanyl in his body
just before the arrest it takes about
five minutes to peak
and so during that five minutes he would
look like he's not dying from fentanyl
but just about the time he was dying in
real life
would have been just about exactly the
time the fentanyl kicked in
and apparently we're going to hear
testimony that there was enough
enough to kill him under some
circumstance and his circumstance was he
had
coveted and heart problems and
high blood pressure i mean if you're on
this jury
you got some you got some serious uh
reasonable doubt here all right um
and it's going to come down to some
doctors who looked at some video
compared to the chief medical examiner
who did an actual
autopsy now i guess there's some
competing autopsies too
so you can have experts disagreeing and
so i ask you this
what good are experts
isn't that the big question the big
question not just for the trial
but life what good are the experts
if experts if if expertise
were a thing they would agree
wouldn't they because if experts
disagree
what is expertise
what is it because you would think at
the very least it's people who are
correct more often than you are but if
you have
two sides both qualified experts and
they're completely opposite opinions
that's not better than you guessing is
it because you
you would have to guess which one of
them is right you don't know
you're not an expert so you would be
asked to be
an expert to figure out which expert is
right
that's absurd because you're not that
expert
so this is one of those cases where you
can see as clearly
it's just as clear as you could possibly
see
that belief in experts is stupid
it's stupid and and we've been fed this
constant diet from
cnn and everybody who wants to look
smart to say if you don't believe the
experts
oh what kind of a dope are you if you
don't believe the experts
and yet every single trial we
have you can bring in experts who can
say any thing sorry
too many in there i know um
that you couldn't have a more clear
example
that's really it is true i would say
this example is very much
generalizable to the whole world my
point is this isn't special
this is exactly the real world experts
are guessing most of the time
most the time and when they're not
guessing
when the expert actually is just right
they're not guessing you can't tell the
 difference
because wait for it you're not an expert
the whole expert thing is
stupidity that we've patched up as
brilliance
it's not it's stupidity
packaged as brilliance and just the dumb
people buy into it like crazy
they just eat it like candy a lot of
experts give me some experts
and anybody with like a little bit more
experience
just saying you idiot you'll
believe anything
all right sorry i'll stop swearing for
the rest of the livestream
but i will i do submit the swearing
is important communication seriously
in all seriousness if you can learn to
use wearing correctly
it's just a little flavor on a point it
makes it far more likely to be viral
frankly not for good reasons but it does
so there's that all right so
um i have called upon our national
leaders in a tweet i made i said i call
on our national leaders to start now
the start now being pretty important to
persuade the public against staging
violent protests after the floyd trial
verdict
i think we all agree there's going to be
violence no matter what the verdict is
right
feels like this and i would say that
given that we know that's going to
happen
i feel like our leaders have an
obligation to
tell people to stand down because if
they don't
is there any precedent for a national
leader let's say
who could have said more to stop an
obvious riot that was forming
if somebody is a national leader and
they could have said something
to stop an obvious riot before it starts
an obvious one see it's the obvious part
that makes it different
if you don't know it's going to happen
maybe that's different but if it's
obvious it's going to happen such as the
capital insurrection
i would call it a capital protest or
capital riot
right it's exactly like the
insurrectionist
and i believe that the news business has
created a little box
that wasn't there before that says if
you know there's going to be trouble
you're not guessing you know there's
going to be trouble
and you're talking in public and the
people you're talking to
are in some way influenced by you you
know they are
democrats are influenced by democrats
exactly
trump supporters are influenced by trump
if you
know there's going to be violence and
you don't stop
if you don't start right now to try to
reduce it
you're encouraging it you're encouraging
it by lack of doing the obvious thing
you should do
people are going to notice if pelosi
isn't telling them to stand down
people are going to notice if biden
doesn't say
anything about potential protests people
are going to notice that kamala harris
just stays silent and if they do
you have to believe that they want these
riots
that is not too far feels like it
doesn't
feels like i took that a little too far
it's like oh scott no
that's not like they're encouraging the
riots no it is it's exactly that
no doubt about it it wouldn't be
encouraging the riots if they weren't
sure they were going to happen
i would say a little different situation
but when you're sure they're going to
happen
and everybody's sure they're going to
happen and they're already organizing
i'm sure
if you don't try to stop it you're
trying to create it
and and i didn't make this standard
i'm not the one who set the standard
this is the mainstream press
this is the democrats it's a very clear
standard
and i've accepted it right i didn't
argue
when they said trump could have done
more
that's a fact trump could have done more
i don't know if it would stop
anything right that's a different
question would it have made a difference
i doubt it but he could have done more
and i think as a leader
he should have been and i've been very
critical of president trump
you know when he didn't do more to you
know control that capital situation
completely legitimate criticism
i would say that's a legitimate
criticism of president trump
it is also a legitimate criticism
of biden if he does nothing right
and pelosi and other leaders so um
that's the trap that they created for
themselves and now they'll they're
walking directly into it
and i expect bloodshed
unfortunately let's do some uh fake news
fact checking on the fact checkers who
are fake news
are you ready somebody needs to fact
check the fact checkers and
i take that responsibility it's got to
be me i guess
so here's the first fact checker fact
check
this fact check comes from factcheck.org
which must be accurate because it says
fact check
right in their name if your name says
factcheck.org
you better do be doing some fact
checking all right here's what they say
quote biden falsely said so we're
looking for his lie here or his
inaccuracy
biden falsely said that quote you can
buy whatever you want at a gun show
with no background check but here's the
fact check
federal fire firearm dealers at gun
shows must run
background checks private sales between
non-dealers are exempt
from federal laws so in other words
there are two ways to buy
a firearm at a dealer show
at a gun show one would be from somebody
who has a federal license
and they're actually just a gun dealer
and somebody and
the other way would be to buy it from a
private individual
in which case there would not be a
background check
so biden says that you can buy
anything you want at a gun show without
a background check true or false
true or false you be the fact checker
fact checkers
no biden is completely right the fact
check is wrong
the fact check is completely wrong and
it's a trick so so hold on
hold on to your opinion for a second let
me explain what the trick is
biden said you can buy any weapon
at a gun show
some of the sellers are are do
background checks
but there are plenty of people who would
wait for it
sell you anything without a background
check
that's exactly what he said the fact
check is wrong
biden's right now i would add to
his rightness that there's a portion of
the gun show that you could not buy
anything you want without a private uh
without a background check
but there's the other part that's maybe
just as big or it could be a third of
the people there
or 25 depends but plenty and plenty of
private deal
private gun sellers so that
hypothetically
if one of those private gun sellers
brought exactly the gun you wanted
you could buy anything you want at a gun
show without a without a background
check
boom joe biden a president i'm not
thrilled about he's right
that's just true right it has nothing to
do with gun control
it's just a true statement and the
factcheck.org
is looking at exactly what i'm looking
at and they even said
in their fact check they actually
they said um they said
private sales between non-dealers are
exempt from federal law meaning also
background checks
so even in their fact check they show
you the proof
that their fact check is wrong it's
right in it's right in the fact check
that the fact check isn't real what the
hell is going on here
now in this particular case i'm doing a
fact check that would be to the benefit
of a democrat joe biden he
absolutely was correct and the fact
check is absolutely wrong
completely obviously wrong but because
they say it fast
it looked true didn't it how many of you
before i gave this simple explanation
how many of you heard this and said oh
yeah no
biden's wrong he wasn't wrong
but it felt like it didn't it are you
having a moment now
i know there's some of you were
listening to this saying wait a minute
like
one minute ago i was positive he was
wrong and
no data changed i didn't change any of
the data
you thought he was wrong and then
without me changing
any facts i showed you is right why did
you think he was wrong
the reason that you thought he was wrong
is that the fact check said he was wrong
and then showed you evidence he was
right
but you took them saying he's wrong
instead of the evidence they showed that
he's right
i just read the rest of the sentence and
said oh actually he's right um
somebody says he's not wrong it's a lie
no he's just right you can buy anything
you want if
a private guy is selling it all right
here's another fact check
this one from daniel dale that's cnn
he said biden was wrong when he said
today that gun makers are the only big
industry that quote
can't be sued and
dale points out that they are immune
from liability over
quote here's the important part unlawful
misuse of guns
but they they have been sued on other
grounds so it's not like gun makers
can't be sued
they're specifically not able to be sued
over
unlawful misuse it's not even use
it's unlawful misuse it's like two
negatives
of guns and so i asked this question
isn't that the same with with everything
if you misuse a manufacturer's product
are they liable in any case
if i take a baseball bat and i beat my
neighbor to death
is the is the person who made the
baseball bat libel
because i didn't use it for baseball i
used it in a way that i would call
what's the the phrase unlawful misuse
i'm pretty sure that the
that the laws at least the way that's
described here there may be some details
that are not in the story so far
but it would be unlawful to use a
baseball bat to kill somebody
and it would be a misuse of the product
it would be used outside of its
its approved context
i'm not even sure there are any laws
about guns that aren't universal
are there or at least is not described
in the fact check
am i wrong about this i feel like i must
be missing some big point or something
but do the gun makers have any
protection that isn't common to
a hundred percent of all products do you
think that apple has protection
if i take this iphone and i i find a
you know somebody weak and i smash him
to death with my iphone
somebody gonna sue apple for making an
iphone i'm pretty sure everybody has
this protection
what am i missing here
all right
so there's that and
all right here's another fact check
we're trying to figure
out i i guess biden made the claim that
his work in banning
um fully automatic weapons reduced
uh mass gun shootings so he's made the
claim
that he's already succeeded by banning
some kinds of you know
specially deadly weapons
arguably arguably more deadly all right
but the fact checkers are not so sure
apparently it's ambiguous
there are some studies that might show
that it made a difference
some others the show it didn't but
here's my question
don't people just use whatever is the
next best weapon
isn't that all that happened if you were
if you were intent
on doing a mass shooting and there was
one kind of weapon that was hard to find
and hard to use
but there was another one that would get
the job done just fine
how can it possibly make a difference
that you got rid of one tool that works
just great
but you left all the other tools that
work just great
how would you even expect it to be
different
now the only argue you can make is that
the fully automatic was a more effective
killing machine
and there's not really much evidence for
that is there
because the way these mass shootings
unfold it really is
aiming at one person at a time and
apparently if you've got your handgun or
any other kind of legal firearm aiming
at one person
in close range is going to be pretty bad
for that person
right you don't need the automatic
weapon to to do what you need it to do
yeah you know i don't think you need a
bump stock either it's not really going
to help you
um at least accuracy wise it's not going
to help you
so so i guess that's still
um you know the experts would disagree
whether banning guns makes any
difference at all but i would say it
would be similar to
trying to start to it would be like this
banning one kind of gun when there are
so many substitutes that work
well almost just as well or even better
you could argue in some cases
um somebody says you can bump fire
without a bump stock well you can do a
rubber band or something on the trigger
right you have some other ways to do
that
but i don't think that the uh the bum
stock or any
automatic modifications you make
i don't think they improve your killing
ability i think they decrease it
that's what the experts say right i'll
need a gun expert to fact check me on
that
is uh is that true if
you know so anyway banning a certain
kind of gun it feels to be like
if you wanted to stop drunk driving
accidents you would ban
whiskey if you banned
just whiskey would that reduce the
number of auto accidents from drinking
or would the people who would drink
whiskey
just drink something else well you could
sort of imagine your head there'd be
somebody who says well i like whiskey
but i don't like anything else
so maybe maybe you know
but i feel like the people who are doing
the drunk driving would just drink
something else
so i'm not sure anything that happened
in today's news makes any sense
now the news is a little bit boring
today i think you've noticed
so i'm going to look at your questions
for a minute and see if there's anything
that's especially on your mind
uh yeah i think if you're gonna do a
mass shooting
and you bring a rubber band as any part
of your
as your assault weaponry you're probably
not good at that
um yeah band of salt whiskey what about
gates
well you know all of the uh the matt
gates story
all has the same characteristic to it i
don't trust any of it
everything you hear about the matt gates
situation it just looks like maybe it's
not real
and you know i'm not saying that he did
or not did not do anything i don't know
it's not my job to defend him and and i
want to be very
harsh on the people who say that i can't
talk about a subject
without you know looking like i'm
defending it i
i assert my right to talk about any
topic
even if you think i'm defending it so i
assert that right
um what is your favorite gun for home
defense
well same as everybody right
the handgun gives you time to get to the
shotgun
isn't that the the basic home the basic
home defense right handgun buys you time
to get
to your shotgun i believe that's that's
the theory that makes the most sense
um yeah uh magnum 44.
i i've got a feeling that uh if you had
the dirty hairy gun
you know just the sound of the bullet
pulling back the uh
yeah i've got a feeling just the sound
of the gun would be enough to drive
somebody out of the house
um
oh interesting somebody's saying that if
you sell a gun to a prohibited buyer
you're still in trouble
even if you're are you saying even if
you're not a
official gun dealer even if it's private
but still it would happen
so it doesn't really help you too much
it would still happen
do you feel uh yeah
i i once had a recorded sound of a pump
shotgun
i i was going to play it through my
speakers you know figure out a way to
like play it through the speakers if i
needed to but i think a real gun
probably is better
um
all right what are your thoughts on
ghost guns
um i don't really have a thought on
ghost guns you know i gotta say that the
uh gun the whole gun topic
um the the legalities of it are just
sort of not that interesting
oh it's a straw purchase of a gun for uh
for somebody else is that what a ghost
gun is
if you smoke pot are you not supposed to
have any guns
i don't know that's a good question if
you smoke pot
can you legally have guns you can right
i don't think that would prohibit you
um will 3d printing have an impact
you know even with 3d printed guns i
think they have to have some metal parts
i suppose those could be 3d printed but
you need a better setup
uh somebody says pot use well i think
maybe it depends on the state
all right that's all i got for now and i
will talk to you
tomorrow hit the subscribe button or the
uh the notification button that would
help me out a lot
and i would appreciate it thank you
