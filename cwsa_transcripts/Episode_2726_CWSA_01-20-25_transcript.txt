e
there we go now we're all happy aren't
we the uh the rumble Studio changed the
interface a little bit so I have to
click it every time so I've got a habit
that I need to break all right pregame
dancing Dilbert welcome to the Golden
Age it's also Martin Luther King day and
that's cool too but the Golden Age wow
it only happens once and we're in
it so let me call up my comments and
we're going to have the show that you've
been waiting
for you couldn't be
happier the only thing that could go
wrong is my my sound doesn't
work all right ladies and
gentlemen are you ready to enjoy
today are you ready to just have the
best
time so as we speak I believe that uh
president Trump and Melania are meeting
with the bidens to have some
tea you
know that's exactly how you hand over
the government to Hitler yeah you have
some
tea well maybe the whole Hitler thing
was totally made up and none of it was
true and you're seeing some truth come
out today it's like h no problem I have
a little tea with you and we'll give you
a peaceful transfer of power because it
was all fake ladies and
gentlemen all right well it's a golden
age from the tip of Maine all the way to
the bottom of the Gulf of
America you've heard of that right the
Gulf of America because that's one of
the first things Trump's going to change
yes he's already announced that the Gulf
of Mexico will be the Gulf of America
and a few hundred other
things now before we get going I want to
tell you about my own Golden Age Miracle
you probably know that yesterday I was
feeling quite ill and it looked like I
had three maybe three or four problems
at the same time uh I had intense pain
in my hip area that I thought was maybe
signal I needed to get a hip replaced so
that didn't make me happy couldn't even
walk on it
you know I could limp but I couldn't
walk and then I also have an untreated
hernia in the same part of my body I
thought oh my God the hip pain is
exacerbating exacerbating the hernia
which by the way the standard of care
these days is to not treat it so not
treating a hernia sometimes makes more
sense because the operation has some
risks but just living with it has
slightly smaller
risks so I couldn't walk which means I
couldn't exercise for a week for a
week and everything hurt all the
time I also apparently got some kind of
Co I figured because I had chills that
were just incredible chills I couldn't
get rid of them and and uh my body achd
and I was fatigued and I couldn't
eat and then I took a
nap during the during the Trump rally
you know the beginning of the golden age
and then I woke up from my nap it was my
fourth or fifth nap that day did I
mention that I was
fatigued I think it was my fifth nap in
the afternoon and I woke up and I stood
up and it took me a moment to
realize all my symptoms were gone my leg
felt okay completely
okay my and then I took out my
perplexity app and I said is it possible
that if you're in pain for a long time
you could get body chills yes is it
possible that when you're in pain you
could feel
nausea
yes every one of my symptoms was from
the same cause which I think was
probably some kind of a pinch
nerve so probably the nap put me in a
position accidentally that unpinched it
I woke up and entered the Golden Age I
was quite sure that today would be hell
for me because the last seven days have
been cured now if you watch me if you've
been watching me for a while I'm going
to drop a little fact on you that will
only mean something to the people who
watch me a
lot that that morning I decided to use
affirmations to see if I could get rid
of whatever my problem
was a few hours later there was none
left it's just completely gone I I'm I'm
100% so I'm
so that's how I entered that's how I
entered the golden age if you can do
better than that good
luck all right so everything's good on
my end thanks for asking um as you know
there's lots of Biden pardons being
dropped at the last minute Anthony
fouchy Mark Millie General Millie and
the January 6 people like uh like Liz
Cheney and kinzinger and the others are
all pardoned pardoned without even being
accused of a crime at least by the
justice system and but Anthony fouchi
might have a little trouble ahead
because Florida which is not uh is not
affected by the federal pardon is
already looking into fouchy for State
related crimes H where have we seen this
trick before oh yeah it was the lawfare
against Trump they make sure that it's a
State Crime so that the evil feds can't
do something to stop
it well well maybe that trick is
something that the Republicans
learned so DeSantis will be going after
fouchi it sounds like or already is
looking into it uh the rest of them you
know
what
weirdly I kind of don't
care because I don't want to live in the
past I'm not really super interested in
crushing the losers as bad as they were
do I think they deserved jail yes I do
in my opinion the January 6 people are
some of the worst people I've ever seen
in American history uh was there a crime
involved I assume so I mean I don't know
how you could do the things they did and
you know the I mean it it was just so
obviously an
OP that yeah I think I think they
deserve prison but I also don't live in
the past so I think the pardon is for my
from my point of view it's an acceptance
of guilt so now they're all they're all
tainted do you remember when they tried
to make Trump a felon and that'll stop
him didn't work he's the
president of the United States felon and
all but let's see if you can handle it
let's see if you January 6 people can
handle being pardoned which the entire
country will regard as an admission of
guilt so you know what Trump didn't do
he didn't admit guilt yeah he didn't
admit
guilt all these people effectively
admitted guilt by accepting the pardons
now you could argue as as Eggheads will
argue they'll say but Scott pardons
don't mean that it could be they just
don't want to do the problem of being
you know going through the system it's
not really that they are admitting
they're
guilty well I get to interpret it any
way I want I'm perfectly happy if you
interpret it differently my interation
is guilty and that's
it are we missing something is there
something that you want that you that
you're missing the simultaneous
zp I was so happy about the Golden Age I
forgot the simultaneous zp well we're
going to have to do the Sip I'm I'm
going to skip the preamp the
Preamble but if you've got your beverage
ready Let's uh let's have a toast
instead of a sip let's make it a toast
to the golden
age and by the way thank you all for
being with me the entire time most of
you have been on this
journey
now let's look at some of the other
things um did you know according to the
amuse account on next that's an account
you should follow on X amuse uh do you
remember the Adam shiff went on TV and
said that blanket pardons would be a bad
idea if Biden did them so even Adam
Schiff didn't want Biden to do blanket
pardons because he thought it looked
bad
and then he did the blanket Pardons and
now he looks
bad so I the the weirdest part about the
beginning of the golden age is I find
myself agreeing with Adam Schiff and I
had to keep saying wait what what wait
wait Adam Schiff is saying something I I
agree with and that what and then he
even sort of he just nailed the whole
thing that it wouldn't be a good
precedent or a good look to do all whole
bunch of Pardons it makes the entire
Administration looks crooked so You'
never want to do
that so Adam shiff if you're
listening welcome to the Golden
Age I'm going to do a little a little
bit of gloating today if you don't mind
does anybody
mind would anybody be offended if I do
some grotesque gloating
today just a little bit come on just a
little bit you can join
in all
right let's see what else
uh so obviously I'm going to get get to
all the I'll get to all the you know the
immediate things that are going to
happen when uh Trump takes over we'll
talk about everything but I wanted to
set up by reminding you of what I'm
going to call the
journey because even though there's a
national Story and there's a trump story
many of you including me have a personal
story that ties closely into the larger
story and I just want to remind you of
the journey that many of you came with
me from the beginning how many of you
have been watching me since
2015 maybe back in the Periscope days
all right for those of you you know the
following you know that in 2015 I was
one of the first people in the country
uh with an Coulter and just a few others
to say that Trump would win but that
wasn't impressive because everybody who
supported him thought he could win I was
one of the few public figures who said
it with an Coulter Etc so I wasn't alone
but uh I I got on board pretty quickly
but I made a prediction back then that
the others did not make so I'm sure that
I'm the only one who said this I could
see it coming as clear as I could see
the nose on my face if I go cross
cross-eyed I can see it sort of I'm
looking at it right now um here's what I
can say I predicted publicly and several
times that Trump would do more than
change politics I said he would change
how you would view reality
itself how would I
do have you ever seen anybody make that
prediction before
that a candidate would change more than
politics would change the way you saw
reality
itself and that's what we
observed now I'm not going to say that's
the best prediction ever
made but it's up
there if you're going to put together a
list of the best predictions anybody
ever made in any
domain that would be a finalist I mean
that was pretty good remember this this
today I'm just going to give myself full
permission to glat so if you find this
you know too hard to watch I totally get
it I'm going to do it anyway because the
gloating is is a shared gloat all right
everybody who supported me everybody who
took time out of their day to watch a
little bit of my stuff either my Poston
X or anything else you are part of this
because without that there wouldn't be
any me talking to anybody right so I'm
not I'm not taking all the credit it I'm
explaining what happened the
journey all right that was 2015 and then
as you know a scrappy bunch of Patriots
as I call them with unusual persuasion
skills unusual persuasion skills uh back
Trump who had his own incredible unusual
persuasion skills and took it all the
way to Victory now I think this is the
blind spot that the regular Democrats
and the regular press have they don't
really understand
persuasion and if I I'll I'll just name
some names if you drop a Mike
cernovich into a
situation with his powers of
persuasion things
change if you drop me into a situation
because I'm a trained Persuader
literally a hypnotist things change it
doesn't matter if I'm on jury duty and
it's 12 people or it's a bigger crowd
persuasive people who have studied persu
they're not just lucky they're not
Naturals although Trump seems to be a
natural um but largely is people who
took some time to study it and I trained
a number of people I think serno did too
just by you know Association more and I
wrote a book on it so you can read it
and do it yourself wi bigly and I think
it made a difference I think the
persuasion power uh trumped literally
Trump uh standard politics but of course
only because Trump was the candidate any
other candidate would made a difference
but but the
persuasive um
non-traditional political
entrance made a big
difference I think Charlie Kirk could be
in that uh hugely persuasive category as
well you could you I don't want to leave
anybody out because I'll name some names
later for other credit
but um that's what happened so then 2020
comes uh some of you say the election
was stolen but I think we could all
agree that it was stolen by fake news so
if there had not been fake news and Joe
Biden had not run on the fine people
hoax without anybody in the in the
corporate news challenging that fact the
most
debunked hoax in American history
clearly debunked all you had to do is
look at the video and the entire
corporate
press allowed him to run for office
primarily on that lie and never fact
checked
him just think about that and that was
so
effective he actually won the election
Joe Biden become president so you could
argue all day about oh the votes were
counted wrong or there was this
irregularity and maybe you know I I
still think there are things that are
unexplored about 2020s election process
but the one thing we can all agree is it
was rigged by the media the media was
not trying to tell you what was true
they were trying to get Biden elected at
any cost and it's obvious I mean
everybody everybody watched can tell
that so I got to admit that caught me by
surprise because there was an avalanche
of hoaxes and they used the Overton
window to make people like me people
would normally be good at
persuading uh um lost basically I was
drowning in hoaxes and anything I did to
try to say one is not true just got lost
in all the next hoax and the next hoax
and the next hoax so I have to admit I
was a little bit lost but then at around
2020 I realized that there was one
hoax that was more important than all
the others I called it the T pole hoax
the fine people hoax and I I also
sometimes called it the Rosetta Stone
now that one doesn't work as well for
Branding because not everybody not
everybody knows what a Rosetta Stone is
but the idea was if you could just
understand how this one hoax was done it
would unlock your mind to see how all
the others were done and
so to my credit yes I'm going to take
credit for
this the hard part was not debunking it
although I and others I'll talk about
this later put a lot of time into it we
put years into debunking that thing but
it wasn't the debunking that made the
difference it was knowing that's the
one that was the trick I I recognized
that if you could take this one out it
was the tent pole and the entire tent
would
collapse and
so uh many of us worked on this uh shout
out to Joel Pollock Breitbart Steve
Cortez who worked tirelessly made a
great video on debunking it um Greg geld
on Fox he was the primary voice
debunking it on Fox which was also
convenient because he has two of the
best shows on Fox and the most watched
so that made a big
difference um eventually that caused um
enough material to be out there that uh
Snopes even debunked in 2024
however things did not go swimmingly for
me between 2020 and 24 you may have
heard did anybody hear I got
cancelled almost two years ago today in
February uh I got cancelled now if you
weren't following it closely you might
have said hm he said some bad things and
he got cancelled but that's if you
believe
news if you believe the news doesn't
take things out of context well I'm
sorry you're a little bit bit lost I
didn't get cancelled by a single
Republican so may I say to every
Republican thank you zero zero
Republicans canceled me not one not in
person not by email not by mean comment
on X not
one because it was
political and do you think that I was
taken out because I was maybe
chopping away at their 10
pole so I had almost the 10 pole go on
when they canceled me sent me back a
little bit but you know me it just
pissed me
off just pissed me off so I doubled down
I tried harder and I just went after
that t pole like a beaver and I
was chewing on that thing as hard as I
could chew and I decided it was going to
be the tent po me one of us was going
down then the tent pole fell it started
slowly with some big names you got your
Elon Musk you got your Joe Rogan you get
your jamath and the Allin pod guys
pretty soon you had famous tech people
like Sean McGuire Mark pinkis although
he didn't go
public
and then the tent pole
broke and just like I predicted
and remember the chewing on it like a
beaver is just hard work that's not the
Magic The Magic is knowing which one was
the 10 pole and when the T pole fell
you're seeing one person after another
yeah I think Bill lman said it too
you're seeing one person after another
say yeah that was the Turning Point as
soon as that as soon as I realized I
lied about that and especially because
Biden and because Oba Obama doubled down
on it after it been debunked on Snopes
after he still doubled down on it to
support Biden unbelievable so that's
when you realize that it wasn't just
Biden as a liar you could see it was
something about the entire even the
prior Administration it was just corrupt
in a way that was impossible to believe
until you saw this
proof so Snopes debunking in 20124 gave
me another Surge and allowed me to show
that it wasn't purely a Republican thing
and you could see that snow switch leans
left typically or is blamed for Le
leaning left I can't confirm that but uh
that made people say oh really really
and really woke people
up
so but you know it's not really good
news um oh and then the other the other
part of this was watching the magga
people reframe Unity do you know how
Biden said I'm going to give you Unity
but he did exactly the opposite he was
the most he really just hated half the
country and he let you know it was the
opposite of unity but Trump came in with
this
concept called Common
Sense do you remember the first time you
heard him say common sense and you said
to yourself wait a minute yeah the
things that Trump wants to do are not
just classic Republican stuff it's just
getting rid of the non-common sense
things that Democrats keep doing so all
the common sense people which are the
tech people the tech leaders are all
common sense people they they work in
the real world all day long they only do
real things after real things after real
things they're Common Sense people or
they couldn't be where they were as soon
as they heard Common Sense here that
here I'm you know I'm speculating I
think they said I could back
that you know uh I'm not going to back
everything Republican I think a lot of
them said uh maybe they disagree on
things like abortion Etc but Common
Sense we need that so much now I helped
I helped try to popularize that as many
people did so I don't take any credit
for that that's all Trump uh and he
found the two words that could unite the
country common sense now I don't think
that that would have United the country
except that we just gone through 10
years of the opposite of Common Sense
and we all kind of saw it so that's what
made it powerful it's not just the
message and it's not just the messenger
you have to get the right message at the
right time to fit the room that's what
Trump does better than anybody's
everever done
anything he finds he finds the right
message for the right time for the right
room like nobody I mean he's just the
best but you know there was still this
problem of Scott being cancelled which
as you might imagine was financially
disastrous for
me
but if you'd like to enjoy this and I
hope you will it's two years later from
my
cancellation and this past 12 months
were the best I've ever had
financially why because I bet on Elon
Musk I moved I moved Dilbert to ta
subscription it's doing great uh then
Elon Musk started monetizing accounts
that were big and had comments and I
didn't have that big of an account until
I got cancelled once I got cancelled I
ended up with more than a million
followers so now I can monetize it and
it allowed me to have an exit from the
newspaper World which I reviled I
absolutely hated being paid by the fake
news imagine spending all day long
railing about fake news and then they're
paying you I didn't like it but it was
also a really good money so you know
like and then those two things of course
weren't enough to you know take me up to
where I was but in the beginning of the
summer I loaded up on Tesla
stock because I was just betting on him
I was just betting that you know the
Trump Administration would win that that
would be a good situation and that
robots are coming and self-driving cars
and Ai and uh whatever you think of
Tesla stock it's probably going to go up
so it has now doubled
so all things
considered cancellation is the best
thing that ever happened to me it made
me more powerful in
politics and it gave me a million
followers and now it gave me more money
because I had time to before that I
wasn't really managing my investments I
just had it an index fund it just sat
there but as soon as I got cancelled I
thought huh I guess I got to pay
attention to my investments and that's
when I loaded up on Tesla so thank you
so Elon
Musk you made me happy and I'm a little
bit happier even because Charles blow
who was one of my many critics he's a uh
it's important to the story that you
know he's a black man who was working
for the New York Times and he had a
column and when I got canceled boy did
he dunk on me well New York Times just
released him from his regular
column
so sorry about that Charles blow turns
out that being a lying Dei hire piece of
 didn't work out for you did it in
the long run but I'm still here in fact
the numbers on my uh on my live stream
are a record high highest they've ever
been
too bad about that Charles blow
though uh so what else is changing CNN I
just saw an episode on CNN I think it
was yesterday showing uh maybe it was
this morning in which the CNN
correspondent was making a point to talk
to two black um supporters of trump who
were waiting for the rallies or
inauguration I'm not sure which and both
of them of course praised Trump and just
said yeah Trump Trump trump now
it has always been true that Trump had
some black supporters would CNN ever
have interviewed them as as in this is
the point of the segment you know we're
going to talk to some black people see
and who love
Trump can you even imagine they would
have ever done that in
2016 nope can't imagine it so the world
is moving toward Trump in small ways and
large um let me tell you one of the
other predictions I made back in
2020 in 2020 when Trump was out of
office and he was disgraced and the
January 6 thing looked like nobody could
possibly survive I
said third
act do you remember that I said this is
going to turn out like a movie with
three acts the third act in any movie is
when everything is so bad that the hero
can never
recover January 6 was the third Act I
told you it was and then I told you that
every day from that time Trump would get
more
popular how' I do well according to CNN
poll um Trump is going into office at
the highest he's ever been approved and
Biden is lo is leaving office at the
lowest approval rate of any one-term
president now being a one-term president
is already a losing situation
but he's the biggest loser of the
biggest
losers that and that's on CNN so CNN is
even emphasizing that Biden is The
Biggest Loser among the biggest losers
now that includes of course Trump in
2020 because he was he was one term up
to that point
but that's pretty
bad pretty good for
Trump um and now 58 according to the
Gateway pundit Cassandra McDonald's
writing the 58% of Democrats and
Democrat leading
Independence report that the Democrat
Party needs quote major changes or to be
completely reformed that's 58% of
Democrats say the party is a mess 58% of
Democrats talking about their own party
what was that um in
2022 34
it was only 34 and it went up to 58% and
said you your whole party is garbage
that ladies and
gentlemen is what happens when you pull
the tent pole out the whole thing
collapses so the the collapse of the
democratic party is completely
predictable from the tent
pole well let's talk about the Trump
rally yesterday the Village People were
there so I read once I if it's still
true but I read once where the Village
People uh insist that they're not gay
and that you know that's not what
they're about now I'm willing to believe
that's true and I don't care one way or
the other I mean it's not important in
any way but the fact that everybody
regards them as the anthem for for
gayness but one that we all like have
you ever been in any event you know
prior to the political use of YMCA as a
song have you ever been to any event
event where the the YMCA song came on
and people didn't go nuts for it all
people you it's one of the most
universally enjoyed songs especially if
you had a couple drinks to be honest um
and people will start dancing to it and
you know I never knew the I never knew
the move so I didn't dance to it but I
always felt it I was like oh this one
yeah everybody's in a good mood now so
the fact that Trump would
have what to many people but not to the
Village people perhaps is like the
ultimate gay anthem um that was just a
good look talk about common sense talk
about
Unity great and and I love that the
Village People took the risk because
there is some risk of doing that uh
meanwhile rappers Snoop Dog and Rick
Ross were at the pre-inauguration they
went to the crypto ball I guess now they
might be more interested in crypto than
they are in Trump uh so we have to be
careful how we analyze this but both but
Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross both did music
videos that were so anti-trump I'm not
even going to describe them just let's
just say violence was involved and I
don't know if they've completely flipped
around or if they're just making an
opportunity that you know is unique to
these two characters but I feel like
something bigger is happening especially
in uh Black America especially male
black America America not the female
part so
much um Eric Adams is apparently set to
attend the inauguration he met with
Trump the other day and apparently they
get along now I don't know if Eric Adams
is going to turn into a Democrat or he
needs a pardon or or turn into a
Republican or he needs a pardon or what
I don't know but I love the fact that
America's mayor you the mayor of New
York is often called you know America's
mayor because it's the big one I love
that America's mayor a Democrat a black
man is okay enough with Trump that he'll
go to the inauguration so that's
incredible um and then even Saturday
Night Live attacked uh MSNBC for their
ridiculous
coverage I don't know how many times
that's happened before but it feels like
the Trump effect to me like the like I
think SNL is seeing the mood of the
country
moving and they're just matching the
mood they're not leading anything
they're just matching it which is what
they should do right they're
entertainment they're not supposed to
lead they're supposed to match so good
on you uh you know we we mock some of
the the entertainment entities and often
they're worth the
mocking but I think when they do
something right that meets the crowd and
you know reads the room properly good
job
well um so
allegedly Trump and Biden are and their
spouses are having tea in the white
house right now can you confirm that
that's happening right as we speak
so so the trumps and the bidens are
meeting in the White House wouldn't you
love to hear how that goes wouldn't you
just love to hear
that uh I don't think Trump drinks tea
but it's not it's never too early for a
Diet Coke if you're
addicted so I don't know if we'll ever
hear how that went is that
private it seems to me it should be I I
feel like that last meeting among
presidents should just always be private
with their spouses that's fine but
otherwise always private because that's
a moment that nobody can understand
right nobody else could ever understand
what that feels like what it's like the
importance of it and I do think that
that's an important part of the the uh
the the turnover of power you know the
peaceful turnover of power so I'm going
to give Biden a little bit of credit for
the peaceful transfer of power now I
mean it's tiny little bit of credit
because he's a horrible human being but
my overall opinion of Biden is I don't
think it could be lower you know I think
he's a criminal I think he's a liar I
think he's bad for the country I think
he destroyed half of the country I think
he's a terrible terrible person also has
dementia or something like
it but but he's now the past all right
so as unusual Wales reports has
breakdown of the executive orders coming
uh but he's reporting what he saw in Fox
with Eric dhy so here are the things we
think are coming uh maybe yeah I guess
right after inauguration um he's going
to declare an emergency at the border
and issue proclamations closing in the
Border we expected that designate the
cartels as foreign terrorist
organizations
huh
interesting he's going to uh the remain
in Mexico program and catch and release
will be
reinstated Catch and Release no I think
it I think this is a typo um I think
he's going to get rid of Catch and
Release that would make more sense
military will be directed to construct
new phase of border wall the military
the military is going to build the
wall I don't know that might be a great
idea I'd have to know more about it um
he's going to terminate Biden orders on
Energy Drilling restrictions yes thank
you he's going to return federal workers
to in-person
work that's that's kind of a mixed one
to
me um I get why they're doing it of
course but
but is the whole purpose just to fire
people or to use the space I don't know
um maybe it's just a better way to find
out who's worth firing bring them all in
the office and you can observe them
better H he's going to and and we do
believe that they probably don't do any
work at home they probably figured out
how to do one hour of work every day and
then just go on with their day that's
probably happening he's uh Trump's going
to pause all offshore and wind leases
now this is
interesting because Trump has been an
anti-wind turbine or windmills as you
might call them and he's been consistent
about that I believe he's got a long
history of opposing them for
environmental reasons and because it
doesn't give you enough bang for the
buck um but I worry that pausing isn't
enough to save the whales
so uh let me congratulate
Erica for being one of the uh the the
most effective vocal people about saving
those
whales and uh we got the first step so
the first step is not to do more of it
but the wells were dying at a high rate
with just what's already
there so I hope there's another phase I
don't know how that would work exactly
since they're already there but uh we're
going to need more to save those whales
if anybody cares about saving those
whales um and we know people do
so I helped I tried to help a little bit
on that one but I don't think I was
important to the
outcome
um what else um end Dei hiring practices
in the federal
government do you know how long I've
waited for that
now I don't think the ending it in the
federal government automatically makes
an end in Corporate America but let me
ask you
this if the federal government and the
leaders of the federal government say
we're ending it because it's it's bad
but also because it's
illegal it's illegal to
discriminate how do corporations
continue doing it after the federal
government has determined it's illegal
imagine you're on the board and you just
found out oh the federal government says
the is illegal and we've got this
gigantic
Dei stru
structure wouldn't you feel that's too
much of a risk I would I I would cancel
it immediately now that's not going to
happen people are going to dig in and
fight but I feel like it's might be the
beginning of the Domino's falling and it
might require at least one Corporation
to be sued for racial discrimination
which I really want to happen I think a
few have been haven't some been
successfully sued for racial
discrimination but if we see that just
maybe a few more big cases of somebody
uh getting sued for racial
discrimination because of
Dei uh that should get it done so it's
the beginning of what could be great
Trump's going to withdraw from the Paris
climate Accords um that won't make any
difference to anybody but it's it's it's
good messaging um he's going to order
every agency to remove all federal
actions increasing the cost for
Americans via d regulation so I I think
that means he's going to deregulate um
he's going to suspend security
clearances for the 51 officials who lied
about the hunter Biden 2020 laptop
story all right let me give a
clarification the spies did not
technically
lie what the the 51 people signed was a
letter that says that the hunter laptop
has all the signs of a typical Russian
op that part
is true enough that's true enough so
they didn't say we confirm that this is
Russian instead they say in every way it
looks
Russian to to people who are not
spies you don't realize that they didn't
actually claim
anything but they knew that everybody
would read it as oh it's
Russia so technically they didn't lie
but they did lie like spies they lied
the way way spies lie with some
deniability so yes it's a lie it's a lie
that's not technically a lie but it
doesn't make it less of a lie it's just
the way spies lie so it's a spy lie
don't call it a regular lie it's just a
spy lie it it leads you to believe
something that's not true without
actually saying it directly that's how
spies lie do you know a brainwashing is
brainwashing is leading you to believe
something without somebody sitting down
and saying I'm going to lead you to
believe this who does the brainwashing
in every country the the intelligence
people the spies this is how spies lie
it's a
spye all
right and also uh Trump says he's going
to establish a doge hiring free which I
assume means that he won't be hiring in
the government um won't be increasing
the government I think that's what that
means meanwhile uh We've also heard that
vake um allegedly I'm not sure I don't
believe this yet because it's based on
Anonymous sources so allegedly there was
some conflict between the musk people
and the V people or V himself and we
don't know the nature of it and until
you hear V talk about it you haven't
heard both sides so don't believe
anything till you hear both sides but it
does look like he may be moving his
attention vake from Doge to running for
governor of Ohio uh I don't know this
this is the the next part I'm going to
say is
speculative if I were a young man with
young kids I wouldn't want to move into
DC and or I wouldn't want to leave him
in Ohio and have to go to DC as a
senator or a doge guy so I'm happy for
vag if if what this is is a way to stay
closer to his family closer to his
extended family I'm guessing you know
there's some reason he he's in Ohio it's
not accidental and that this works him
as lifestyle I think he earned it so
good live your best life be a good
governor and when you're done um you'll
have the base for running for president
someday and I think that I I wish you
the best vake because I think you've
earned it
um all right God there's so much
happening
today so
much uh in Arizona they caught uh they
caught an asy Seeker which is being said
with some uh some tongue and cheek but
literally an asylum Seeker got caught
with 30,000 rounds of ammo in a
car okay um this seems to be another
example is sort of the the perfect the
perfect anecdote for the Golden Age
beginning to remind us that Democrats
have this one flaw that's just it's just
jaw-dropping which which is consistently
no matter what the topic is they don't
seem to understand how cause and effect
works um why don't we open up the border
between America and a country run by
cartels but also be make it the pathway
for all the other cartels in other
countries in South America to also use
it huh I think only good things will
happen and the reason I think that is
because I think by analogy and I know we
had a a lot of immigration in the early
part of the country and since we became
the the dominant country in the world
clearly immigration is
good if you think by
analogies you open the
Border what do I teach you about
thinking with analogies it's not
thinking analogies are not part of
reason they're just a a clever way to
make a point sometimes they're not part
of logic reason data fact
it's just bad thinking and I'm going to
give you some more examples where they
use the same bad thinking in a bit um
but if you had asked any Republican
what's going to happen if you open the
border between massive criminal
organization with lots of people who
just want work as well so they so you
even have a a way to disguise the
criminals within the mass of people 100%
of Republicans would tell you that
you're going to have to stop a car with
30,000 rounds of bullet bullets in it
sooner or
later and here we are so the the
complete destruction of the Democrat
Party is perfectly captured in this one
arrest one car with 30,000 rounds where
do you think those rounds were
going every one of those bullets was
going to a criminal I guarantee it
everyone was going to a criminal that's
30,000 bullets to
criminals and the Democrats were all in
on this every one of them the entire
tent has
collapsed uh Trump said uh I think last
night he said he will declassify all the
files related to the JFK assassination
uh Charlie Kirk speculates that uh one
of two things must be true either the
government killed JFK and covered it up
and fought for decades to keep people
from knowing the truth
or uh the files have anything in them
that is anything but boring and things
we've heard before which do you think it
is do you think it's going to reveal
that the government was behind it or
some form of the government or that
there's not really anything there now
Trump has hinted that he knows what's in
the files because he saw them before and
he hinted that the reason for keeping
the private wasn't exactly related to
the question of who killed Kennedy but
it might be some related thing that gets
revealed that you don't want to reveal
maybe about sources and methods I don't
know something like that um here's what
I think and uh I think Charlie Kirk
missed the
possibility let me let me see if I can
test you on cause and effect all right
now remember Democrats don't understand
cause and effect but most of you do
because most of you are Trump supporters
all right see if you can use your cause
and effect to reason out what's in those
files all right let's say a government
entity killed Kennedy and then a
government entity created the files
about what happened possibly the same
people who were involved with the
warrant commission Who We Believe are
the most likely suspects in the murder
itself so the people who did the murder
are in charge of creating the physical
records that say they were guilty and
then saving them so that future
Generations could see that they're the
real murderers
does that sound like something that
happened in the real world or or do you
think that the people if if and this is
still speculative but if it's true that
the government was so rotten that it
murdered the president and got away with
it you don't think that they would throw
those records away or they wouldn't
write it
down seriously you think they're going
to murder the president and then allow
the records that show they murdered the
president or even anybody in the
government murdered the president you
you think they're going to leave those
records intact for 50 years or whatever
the hell it is no no you're not going to
see anything that implicates the
government in the records kept by the
government to me it seems insanely
obvious that the perpetrators are not
going to keep records of their crime Am
I
Wrong who who who thinks the people who
did the crime kept the records of the
crime so you could find out
later I mean if they could kill the
president and get away with it you don't
think they could read some
records I don't know well we'll find
out uh we'll also find out about maybe
the
UFOs uh but did any of you see the the
amazing
video of a UFA an egg-shaped UFO being
retrieved by looks like a helicopter did
anybody see that video it's being mocked
all over social media people are making
their own videos because it looks like
it was made at home it is the fakest
looking thing I've ever
seen the only thing I could tell you for
sure that's not a UFO I don't know what
it is but the the fact that it's 2025
and and the most conclusive proof they
could give us is an unclear
video really how many decades in a row
are we going to fall for well we
couldn't get a clear
picture nope the only picture we can get
is this one you can't tell what's going
on
anyway
um so let's see Tom homman says that the
uh Trump Administration might
reconsider uh making Chicago the first
place they raid now when that when I
first heard about that I didn't
understand it was a leak I thought they
had announced it but I think it's been
called a leak that Chicago is going to
be first then hman saying well may maybe
we won't because you know now
everybody's going to be ready for it but
I thought to myself at the time I wonder
if it's a
trick do you think you say were going to
go into Chicago but really he was going
to go into every city and all the other
cities would be ah glad they're not
coming into my city they're going to do
Chicago I don't have to hide yet and
that maybe maybe it was always diversion
it's like yeah look at Chicago look over
there look over there and then boom they
go into Baltimore or wherever they go
whatever City they go
to so it didn't make sense to warn them
they were coming but I don't think that
happened we don't know what
happened um Elon
Musk uh is reportedly the the highest
bidder and you would buy this hotel in
DC that he will turn into his own social
club like Mara Lago but in DC
now now this is after uh musk has spent
a bunch of time at Marl Lago so he knows
what that world looks like when you've
got a place that people can come and
stay for a while but also a place where
they all meet and sort of the social
club the mar logo of it and now he's re
it looks like he's going to recreate
that in the
capital um which makes sense so he would
have a very comfortable place to go and
meet all the Doge people he needs to
whenever he's in the
city makes sense I don't know if
anybody's mentioned this before I might
be the first but um Elon Musk is
smart did anybody have anybody heard
that before yeah no I I don't want to
shock you but it's true yeah he's uh
he's
smart this is one of the smartest things
I've ever seen like you think the other
things he does are smart but but you say
well he's Smart in this one way he's
only smart in this one way he's like
good at engineering and Manufacturing
and inventing and and that's more than
one way of course but you think well he
doesn't really understand how the real
world Works in politics because he's a
because he's a you know he's a business
guy doesn't really get it and every time
I heard that I would say to
myself okay I think you're
misinterpreting who he is he's not the
guy who has one set of knowledge and
he's done
he's the guy who can enter an unfamiliar
territory and Conquer it and own it
faster than anybody's ever entered an
unfamiliar territory conquered it and
Own It Trump does that by the way with
politics um so yeah he basically figured
out what would be the most uh the most
engineering
solution to having the kind of influence
and access that he needs to get Doge
done and he properly in my opinion
realize that having a physical facility
makes everything different so
understanding as he apparently does
having a physical facility that people
would enjoy going to just like Mar Lago
except in this case you'd be meeting
musk I guess um is incredibly good
thinking that is just so smart it's like
incredible well as you know Trump says
he's saving Tik Tock we don't know how
we could do that um
there there is some kind of uh clause in
the law that was Banning Tik Tock that
says that the president could give them
a 90-day extension so it won't be banned
um if it's if there's a sale that's you
know contemplated and going through but
I think there's probably a little wiggle
room in that a little wiggle room so I
think executive orders are more about
interpreting things than changing the
law and if he interprets it as yeah
there's offers there's a bunch of people
who want to buy it we just need a little
more time then I think he has close
enough to authority to pause that I
don't know if anybody would make a big
deal about it right because it's not
like anybody's pushing so hard that it
has to happen in 90 days that's not the
the hard part so I think he correctly
read the room again and said that if he
puts his name as the person who's saving
it the people will appreciate it and
probably more people like it than don't
like it because the the risk of Tik Tok
is not obvious to everybody
and apparently this is blowing my
mind China just
announced that for the first time
ever that the company can decide on its
own its
operations China just announced in
effect that is open to selling it or
merging it or making a change now here's
where things get complicated Lindsey
Graham did a post saying that China does
this thing where I think it's called the
Golden share if they have stockholders
in a company if it's arranged in a way
that there's something called the Golden
chair that means that one stockholder
has more control than all the rest of
them put together the golden chair owner
and that that's always president she and
Lindsey Graham says but others say this
is not true so remember other people say
it's not true but Lindsey Graham says
it's true that uh number of companies
are organized that way and we should you
know we should kind of keep them out of
America because it's basically president
she controls them and that could be
risk um but some say that Tik Tok
doesn't have a golden share setup Rand
Paul uh I don't understand Rand Paul and
Tik Tock I I know if he's got a teenager
he's trying to make Happy who uses it
but his arguments don't make sense and
he's the most rational person in
Congress and and whenever he talks about
Tik Tok I go it's like you don't
understand it or you're intentionally
not understanding it don't get it
so so ran Paul thinks the problem is
censorship I think he's talking about uh
the Gaza situation how that went against
Israel and Israel wanted the thing Bann
now that looks like censorship on the
surface but it's really about the
influence that the that the app has and
the Israel situation is just an anecdote
it's not the whole problem the whole
problem is that anytime China wanted to
if indeed they control it they could and
then I saw Rand Paul arguing that the
the share ownership of the company is
really not all it's not all China and
they International investors on most of
it and you know two the two of the
founders own it and blah blah blah so
it's not like China even owns it to
which I say what do you mean China
doesn't own it I don't care if they own
it I care if they control it he didn't
say they don't control it he said they
don't own it which is just a weasel
answer like why is Rand Paul giving
weasel answers right a non- weasel
answer would have been they don't own
shares and they don't control it now
that would be if that were true I don't
think that's true but if it were true
that would be a direct statement and I
would say oh really and then I would
look into it really they don't control
it I thought they did but if your only
argument is who owns what shares that's
 that some Rand Paul
and I don't know why you're doing this
because clearly he's smart enough to
understand all the Nuance in this but
why would you argue with it's
so on a it's so on a plan if it were a
Democrat I'd just say they're stupid or
lying if I saw a Democrat doing that but
Rand Paul doesn't lie and he's not
stupid and he completely understands it
so why is he doing this I'm I'm confused
about it so i' I'd love to know what
what's below that well nval ravikant
weighed in on this and he's watching the
people argue hey censorship is bad if we
censor them they're going to censor us
and we don't want that and uh he says
this he said two things can be true a
foreign adversary should not control our
largest media
property uh he means Tik Tock being the
largest not not ours and laws I think
that's what means the foreign adversar
should not control our largest media
property yeah okay and he says laws
passed in the name of National Security
will inevitably inevitably be used
against domestic opposition now
I stared at those two statements for a
while and I wanted to say h I think you
got it wrong this time Nal but but it's
Nal and I st I kept staring at it and
then of course I just agreed with him
and and it does create two ways to lose
and no way to
win so if you ban
it there's a possibility that some of
our stuff gets more banned than it
already is
and if you let it rough
you've got a national security problem
because it's an adversary that we think
has control whether they own shares or
not so here's my take so I'd like to
give you my take on the tiktock thing
which is more about how to think about
things all right so this is less of my
opinion about Tik Tok it's more about
how how would a reasonable Common Sense
person approach the question so that's
what I want to do for you just just lay
it out in the most common in sensical
way so you can form your own opinion the
first thing you want to do is avoid
analogy thinking as I mentioned earlier
analogies are good for describing
something they're not arguments so if
your argument is an analogy you don't
have an argument so I'm hearing a lot of
people saying that you know things like
well Tik Tok is a free speech platform
and X is a free speech platform so you
know if if some other
country um if we ban some other
country's product then they will ban our
product like X and then X wouldn't be
able to operate maybe in Europe or or
China it doesn't I think it X isn't in
China right I think it's banned in China
but the argument is whatever we do to
other people's products they'll do to us
I could see that I can see that but the
trouble is that's analogy thinking and
it's the wrong analogy
because the analogy is not everything's
a free speech platform what you do to
one will happen to the other that's the
wrong
analogy it's true but it's not how you
should analyze this thing so the the
wrong analogy is that a platform that's
controlled by your adversary is the same
as the platform controlled by your
friend what kind of analogy is
that it it's an analogy that ignores the
main point one's an
adversary and they could push a button
and and brainwash Americans in one
second at least pushing the button takes
one
second X is famously free speech and
it's on our side and the owner of it is
very much on our side how do you compare
handing a weapon of mass destruction
which is what a platform would be if a
government had control over it it would
be a weapon of mass destruction it could
destroy a country so do you how do you
compare uh I want my country to have
nuclear weapons
good versus I would like my adversary to
have
them bad because we don't have the same
weapon to control China because they ban
all our social media so why would you
give a weapon to your adversary if you
didn't have to so that's where the the
analogy fails so it's the analogy
thinkers who are not understanding that
these are not comparable things you
don't treat one the same because because
it's like that other thing they're just
they're opposites one is a weapon of
mass destruction for your friends on
your side and once's a weapon of mass
destraction for your enemies that is the
correct
frame the other thing
is um You Can't Ban an app in the US
because our apps will being banned that
sounds logical until you remember that
China already bans all those apps we
can't run our apps in China but they can
run them in United States and it's the
biggest most influential one Tik Tock so
that's a bad argument that uh so uh and
then there's also the argument well
American companies look at your private
data
too oh that's analogy
thinking yes American companies look at
your data and we're all uncomfortable
with that and you might wish that it
stopped and I wouldn't argue with
it's bad but America doesn't want you
dead well maybe the Democrats are not
too happy today but generally speaking
America is on your side more so than the
adversary now sometimes they don't act
like they're on your side and certainly
when you know Biden was President he was
hunting Republicans and God knows what
he was doing with social
media but uh you cannot compare American
companies is having your personal data
with an adversary having your personal
data now let's complete why you care
about having the data the reason you
care about who has the data is that
that's how influence works you know
enough about the person that you know
what messaging is going to work it's all
about knowing the individual that's
that's the biggest lever of persuasion
knowing knowing that you've isolated a
group of individuals by some kind of
characteristic and then you give them
exactly the message that that little
group is going to
need now I think that the reason that
our government and really smart people
are completely wrong about analyzing Tik
Tok completely wrong is that persuasion
is not something that
everybody understands people understand
politics they understand business they
understand
analogies um too much unfortunately and
if you use those frames the Tik Tok
thing doesn't look like a risk but let
me explain how persuasion could work on
Tik Tok it could work the same on any
social media but again you're worried
about your
enemies all right here's how here's how
Tik Tok could do persuasion and you
would never detect it you would never
detect it first they use all your
personal data to determine if you're
definitely uh unmovable on politics if
you're movable they just send you random
equal number of messages on both sides
of whatever topic and it doesn't change
your mind and they knew that but if they
identify the people who are movable in
other words it doesn't look like they're
partis in One Direction those are
persuadable and for those people if you
wanted to persuade them but you didn't
want to get caught you would send pro
and con messages to them in equal
numbers and then if somebody checks they
say well it looks like these persuadable
people got you know an equal amount from
both sides so you know you can't say
that that's biased unless you understand
persuasion because if they do if they
count them oh it was 50 memes a piece 50
memes One Way 50 memes the other
direction balanced no you need to know
how powerful the memes are if one side
got all the good memes which Tik Tok
could determine by popularity and other
other memes you send all the good memes
on one side and all the weak stupid
memes on the other side and then this
person sitting on the fence looks at two
things they have exactly the same amount
which is the only thing they
count and they go I don't see any bias
here you wouldn't see any bias you
wouldn't know that they isolated the
people that can be moved and you
wouldn't know that they decided which
memes to show them you would only know
they got the same amount it's a same
problem we have with our with our own
looking at our own bias in our social
media here's another one you wouldn't
spot you know the book
persuasion by
chelini it talks about how your opinions
can be
changed by what happens just before you
make your opinion so they can put you in
a in a frame of mind that you're more
likely to go one way to the other and
you don't know that they did that so
that's that's like the invisible person
persuasion and then when they get to the
topic that they care about you think oh
I'm in a really good mood today and I'm
very optimistic so I'm not worried about
that
problem right but if they primed you the
other way everything's falling apart
it's it's bad we we we're doomed and
then you see that problem you say I'm
I'm going to repost this because you
know this is bothering me so you would
never be able to spot persuasion because
it's the stuff that comes before the
persuasion you wouldn't even look for it
because one is just mood and attitude
puts you in the mood and then it
completely can can change your opinions
after it now I'm just beginning those
are just examples of how a social media
platform if it wanted to and if it knew
a lot about the people which is Tik Tok
it has the ability to push one button
and completely change Minds in America
now when I say completely remember our
our system is kind of balanced in terms
of Democrats and Republicans so you
don't need to move many people if you
could reasonably move 10% of the public
in every situation you would have total
control of the
country that
risk could not be
explained by somebody like a senator
there is no Senator that I'm aware of
who would understand what I just said at
the way I understand it and the way I'm
explaining it not
so there is there is a blind spot in how
in terms of how powerful persuasion is
even though we all know people can be
talked into things we know people can be
fooled we kind of generally know that
persuasion is very strong and powerful
but we don't know the details if you
knew the details Tik Tok would be a lot
scarier and I know most of the details
so to me it's
scarier meanwhile Instagram uh announced
a new video app that appears to be a
um to be a competitor with Tik Tok I
don't really understand that because I
thought the Instagram was sort of
already a video app but I guess because
it has other things than video it it's
not as clean as Tik Tok maybe so maybe
it's just maybe it's just one move to
get you know right in that space where
it was only sort of around that space so
that's the right move um Zuck is good at
fast
following meanwhile the all pod guys
were interviewing Eric
swell one of my California
representatives and uh uh Jason of the
Allen pod was uh asking some questions
in a clip I saw he was asking SW one
basically he was saying you know you
lost me you know he said I voted
Democrat 200 three times but basically
the you know the current performance of
the Democrats lost him as a supporter
and here's what swell started with I
swear to God he started with
us we need a better
story oh
wow wow they're still clinging to the
only problem was how they talked about
it now do you think they believe that do
you think the prominent Democrats think
the only problem is their persuasion
wasn't as good as trumps the only
problem
that that was it that's what it
was I don't know to me it looks like
they're completely
lost uh and can never come
back uh
meanwhile the New York Times is
reporting now and this is uh the amuse
account again spotted this so the the
important part of this story is it's
happening now all right so remember I'll
tell you the story
but the fact that it's just happening
now is what makes it a story okay so
they're reporting that in 20122 and
again they're just reporting it now
that's the important part uh Secretary
of State blankin he rejected calls for
peace in Ukraine uh despite warnings for
the Pentagon that Ukraine was unlikely
to achieve a stronger bargaining
position even General Millie was urging
the government you know this be a good
time to negotiate uh you know this will
be a good time it's not going to get
better uh it's never going to get better
you how about now which is exactly what
all of us were thinking right is there
anybody here who is not saying in 2022
you know the faster you do this the
sooner you do this the better you are
it's not going to get better it might
get worse probably won't get better this
would be a good time to
talk but uh apparently blinkin according
to the New York Times uh pushed ahead
and wanted the conflict and they morphed
it into more of a strategy that wasn't
so much about defending poor Ukraine it
was more about using them as a porn to
weaken a strategic rival I think this is
amuses words not the New York Times
um but that's obviously what it was and
they said that directly so I think
blinkin and others said yeah you
know we we'll be weakening the our
biggest military rival if he don't count
China
and so meanwhile the media was framing
this again this is the amuse accounts
take on it the media framed the policy
as Pro
Ukrainian H and they were like vilifying
any dissent as a you know Putin lover oh
you you like licking Putin's butthole if
you said anything about maybe we should
just end this war and negotiate it
um so basically it just turned into a
propaganda thing and it's as evil as it
looks and now the New York Times feels
that they can report it because do you
think the New York Times couldn't have
reported this story in
2022 I think they could have I think
they could have but they
didn't meanwhile communist
Vietnam see if you think this is uh the
uh Argent Ana's melee effect or what the
Communist Vietnam said they're going to
follow libertarian melee's path and try
to model their country after it so so
Vietnam communist
Vietnam uh is doing this bold path to
restructure a state
apparatus and uh radical reforms and
they're going to copy
Argentina and they're going to
drastically reduce the size of the state
and ease their bureaucratic burden
Vietnam do you know anybody from
Vietnam so you know there number of
people in California who were born in
Vietnam I know a bunch of them and I got
to tell you they're pretty awesome
people in almost every way you can
imagine they're very awesome people
Vietnam
is is way I don't know more capable and
smarter than you'd ever imagine they're
they're they're good
people anyway
okay um I think that's more of the
Common Sense breaking out everywhere all
over the world all right there's going
to be plenty more on the inauguration
we're all going to watch I think it's
kicking off right after the show what
time is it well I think we all want to
watch um I believe in 30 minutes or so
uh is actual swearing in you're going to
watch that live so I'll end before that
but some backward science
maybe um there was an article in sa
poost by Eric Dolan that suggests that
watching Fox
News um you may be good for Republicans
getting elected no surprise um but that
uh Fox News had been picking up a lot of
audience in recent years and that might
be
behind the the good
effect oh the Trump swearing in ceremony
started but I think Trump's
actual uh the Trump ceremony started
okay um I don't know if that means he's
doing it I think I think his part is at
11:40 eastern
time so anyway
um so I think this is backwards it it
seems to indicate that watching Fox News
turns you into a republican but I would
argue that literally nobody's going to
watch Fox News unless they're already
leaning in that direction because it
would be painful to watch something that
disagreed with everything you believed
so certainly there's an effect that Fox
News can Harden somebody's Republican
opinion definitely but I feel like the
reason that they got more coverage would
be a combination of the following MSNBC
has mental
clowns CNN is so is basically so
disgraced that this point it must be an
embarrassment to watch them especially
if you've spotted the hoaxes that they
run and bigger than all of those things
I'll give my usual shout out to the
producers and hosts of Fox News they're
just better what what about if it's just
a better product I don't know if you
spend any time watching you know which I
do I I try to sample all the news
channels Trump the the fox people are
just better at it they produced better
the colors on the sets are better um the
combination of characters they put
together at the same time are better
their you know the personalities the
personalities of the the talent all
better all better yeah so maybe that's
the little
explanation well China's got a robot dog
called the Black Panther 2.0 that can
run 100 meters in under 10 seconds so
that will give you an idea how fast you
have to run uh to be the last one killed
by the robot dogs now you don't have to
you don't have to outrun all the robot
dogs you only have to outrun the people
who are also running from the robot dogs
because you know they're going to kill
them first so I'll be practicing my
running just to get away from those
robot
dogs um in other news University of
Massachusetts at
emest um their their emest Earnest
pharmaceutical team have some kind of
breakthrough in cancer treatment that's
that's not available yet but they think
they can put anti-cancer agents in
bacteria and apparently bacteria are
some for some reason are attracted to
tumors so if you got a tumor and you
take this certain bacteria it's going to
have some agents in it that are bad for
cancer and they also will use the
bacteria to do only the cancer now that
would be completely better than all the
other treatments which tend to be
damaging to you with side effects so if
it
works if it works would be
amazing but so a little ways off um and
that ladies and gentlemen is all I have
