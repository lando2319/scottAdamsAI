[Music]
hey everybody
come on in come on in yeah
it's time it's time for the best part of
the day
it's called coffee with scott adams
you know that's why you're here and all
you need is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
telstra
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything better including america
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens right now join me
yep yep that's the good stuff
i'm pretty sure the founders of the
country
drank coffee how else could they have
pulled away from great britain how else
well i'd like to start by playing a
little video jack
murphy tweeted this morning and
i don't know if you'll be able to see it
well but you can see it on my
twitter feed and you probably give me
one word that describes
the american revolution better than any
other word
impossible impossible
the founders of this country set out to
defeat the biggest military power of its
day
and then did about the wright brothers
about going to the moon how about elon
musk
it's just one possible thing after
another
so when you watch the president of the
united states the person who is
according to all the smart people
couldn't possibly do this
thing and then you watch him do it
first getting collected about
shaking hands with kim jong-un
black unemployment rate another historic
glow
[Music]
if you watch him do the impossible what
does it do to your mind
are you thinking i could do that before
that's impossible
and then you watch people do impossible
stuff all day long
it changes
[Applause]
one of the things that america has as
it's
just poor dna is that is that impossible
okay watch this put my beard
[Music]
who comes in second place
i gotta say that even though that's my
voice
it's it's not supposed to affect me but
boy does it
i gotta say so
that was kind of amazing um you know not
so much my part of it but the
the production of it it was pretty
amazing
so um
i'll let that let that sink in a little
bit because that feels good
so this is what i tweeted this morning
and here's how i feel as of today
i feel as though we the people have
decided that we're going to get through
2020.
and i think the republic is going to be
intact
and here's why because we've decided
that's what feels different i would say
that even just a few weeks ago
i would have said said to you gosh
i hope we get through 2020
or i wish the things would get better
i i sure am hoping
that we can survive the year and you
know survive as a country
but i don't feel that anymore because
there's a big difference between wanting
something and deciding to get it
and i feel as though there's something
about the approaching election
that takes hundreds of years of american
history
and just makes us focus on it because
the election
is the time to remember the whole
process
right the election isn't just about that
day the election is about
hundreds of years of american history
and it seems to me that in
a number of ways it's becoming
increasingly clear that the citizens of
the united states the
329 million of them were on the
sidelines
watching the 1 million get crazy
i feel like the 329 million
just sort of collectively and somewhat
simultaneously said
okay now we're now we're now we're going
to get serious
now we're going to just make it work
we're just going to make it work it's
going to be hard
there will be bruises there will be
casualties
freedom isn't cheap but
the united states has decided
and there's a big difference between
wanting something
and deciding and it feels as though
the country has collectively decided
here's here's some of the hints
number one we've noticed that
everywhere there seemed to be pushes
toward more seriousness about
taking care of the street crime and the
protests
you can see it in i think it was uh
it was in pennsylvania that first the
the penalties were increased you saw the
president
increase the penalties on federal crimes
against statues
and little by little not in every place
and not all at once
but you're seeing you're seeing also in
florida ron
desantis uh passing some or promoting
some legislation to tighten
uh the penalties about protesting and
protesting and doing something wrong not
just protesting
and so you're seeing everywhere in the
country just starting to tighten up a
little bit
just just tighten a little bit while
still giving people their freedom of
speech
so that's one thing that we're as we're
talking about the
courts getting packed and you know
which could actually be the end of the
republic
you've you've probably seen by now
there's a video
of ruth bader ginsburg with within the
last year
saying that packing the court would
destroy the could destroy the republic
that's ruth bader ginsburg said
recently that packing the court
could destroy the republic now
to the degree that people respect her
opinion
you think that would be a pretty
important i don't believe we have heard
hillary clinton support packing the
court can somebody fact-check me on that
that's important
i don't believe we have seen obama
recommend or even be in sport of
packing the court again fact check me on
this
we have now seen joe biden favor
packing the court
and because of that
i feel as though it's not going to
happen
you know sure the people on the left
will talk the pundits will talk
but if you don't have obama you don't
have
hillary clinton and her her old machine
and you don't have joe biden saying it
it's just not going to happen
so i don't think court packing
is going to happen i do think the
economy is
improving just like you thought i do
think that with or without
vaccines we will get through this
and i do think
that pretty much everything's going to
be better in 2021
pretty much everything here's some other
things that are looking good
the when the president uh did his
executive order
about uh making it basically making it
uh illegal or banned to do
critical race theory training in the
government
apparently that executive order was
bigger than you think
so it wasn't just banning critical race
theory
from being taught in the government it
also included the military maybe you
knew that part but here's the part maybe
you didn't know
it extended to contractors
so anybody who wants to be a contractor
and sell to the
government now has to
apparently demonstrate or they can't be
guilty of
teaching critical race theory to their
own employees
what does that do to the entire fortune
500
who who depends on the government in
many cases for
sales so most of the fortune 500
probably have
something they're selling to the
government and if they're
if they're teaching critical race theory
internally
they won't be able to sell to the
government
that's a big deal let me tell you why
this makes me feel good you know you're
always worried about the
slippery slope right and i and i always
tell you
yes things do go you know in a direction
because there's inertia you know and
there's momentum and stuff so
so things will overshoot the mark
but inevitably before things go
to completely crazy there will be a a
force that pops up to stop it
i think this executive order was that
force
because i've never seen anything i don't
want to exaggerate
i've seen something cool before but
the the power of this
that the government of the united states
just declared this thing
literally illegal basically i don't know
if it's technically illegal or what
what the word would be but the fact that
critical race theory was sweeping the
land
and the the president of the united
states just said
completely accurately absolutely
unambiguously correct this is the most
correct thing
anybody's ever done this is racist
it is scapegoats one group
and they actually use the word scapegoat
and when i saw that word i said
that's it that's the word
because i felt like i wanted to call it
racist
you know i want to say well isn't this
racist against white people
and then you get into the whole can you
be racist against
the group that is considered the
dominant culture for years whatever
i thought you don't even need that word
you don't need the word
racist you can just say scapegoat
we don't live in a country where you can
scapegoat one race
that period and i'm pretty sure
that most people agree there you know
you've seen some evidence that the
president's
likely support among black voters
is sort of impossible to believe
because we're seeing numbers like you
know 25 to 40 percent or whatever in
that range
of of likely support from black voters
do you even believe that does that sound
possible
because the the uh the polls especially
rasmussen
are very consistent about this and i
think the other polls show that it's
historically high as well
now that's a good sign
that's a good sign and it tells you that
the craziness you're seeing in the news
and on social media
seems to be a little bit limited to the
news and social media and people like me
who watch the news too much
right so i feel as though this
little this executive order against the
critical race theory
was so right and so timely
and just so perfect it was very american
because um you know we like a good fight
i don't mind the fact that critical race
theory
exists i don't mind the fact that an
argument was made
because it's america right freedom of
speech take your best shot
everybody gets to take their best shot
the president just took his best shot
his best shot just eliminated your best
shot but that's how the system works i i
don't hate that
i don't mind the back and forth as long
as you get a
productive you know outcome of that
so that's all good um
i feel as though we will be fine so
here's some
more some weirdness uh
michael bloomberg has offered to pay the
fines for felons in i guess florida
so that over 30 000 people will will be
able to vote
because they would be prohibited from
voting unless they paid their fines
so he's just going to pay all their
fines now of course
this raises the question is this legal
is it is it legal for a billionaire to
basically buy votes if he's buying them
indirectly
because he's not saying i'll pay your
fine if you vote for democrats
he's just saying i have a feeling
i just have a feeling that most of you
would vote
democrat so maybe i'll give you the
right to vote by paying off your fines
i don't know if that's legal it's
certainly on the border line of legal
isn't it
because it's one of those things where
you say to yourself
okay what if it's technically legal he
probably has some lawyers look
into it so he probably has an argument
at least
what if it's technically legal are you
okay with it
are you okay with it just because it's
legal
unfortunately that's the system we have
to be okay with it because it's legal if
it's legal
but it's very close isn't it
it's like it's it's legalish
or it's legal but it shouldn't be you
know i
you can easily imagine a law being
passed
within the next year that says you know
now that we've looked at it
maybe that shouldn't be legal
we'll see and it it could actually
change the election i have to wonder
how many how many uh convicted felons
who don't pay fines
also vote i feel like it's not a good
investment
in terms of the number of people he's
going to get to vote because really
that that probably has to be the the
group least likely to vote
we'll see it doesn't take many to change
the result
um but it looks like uh matt gates is
asking for a criminal investigation so
we'll see
um so the big news today is the
the report from i guess ron johnson etc
on uh the bidens and
the i'm very uncomfortable
with the accusations against the bidens
but i want to be really clear
so you know what i'm complaining about
and what i'm not complaining about
okay somebody says wrong again
scotty goodbye
you you had three reasons to be blocked
for saying wrong without a reason for
calling me
scotty and for writing it in all caps so
if you were trying to get blocked
that was a home run three for three
all right uh so here's what makes me
uncomfortable about
the biden report number one it's a
laundry list
what do i tell you about laundry lists
if somebody presents a laundry list
it's probably not legitimate because
if there were one good strong thing on
the list
they would just lead with that one thing
because that's all you need
you wouldn't need the extras if you had
one good one
so it does mean probably you know almost
certainly
it means that some of the things on the
list of
badness or allegations probably not so
strong
but the list makes it look like well
even if one of them's not real you got
all this other stuff
okay maybe the other one's not real too
but you still got some other stuff
oh we've run out of time you see how
that works
the list guarantees that you can't be
defended
because you just run out of time you you
don't have enough room in a tweet
nobody's going to read a whole article
about it if it's on tv
people just run out of time so the list
guarantees that you're guilty by
accusation
i complain about this when they use it
against trump
and i'm not going to not complain about
it if it gets used against biden
all right so i'm going to try to be
consistent because i feel like
there's there's something useful in that
in terms of a
you know a lesson if you will and
it reminds me very much of the steele
dossier
there's you know russian involvement
there's associations that look unsavory
there are things that look like they're
unpleasant
possibly illegal but we don't have proof
or
you know there's there's some kind of
fog but it might not be smoke
it's just sort of this big not quite
sure
what's true and what's not mess fairy
steel dossier
now did karma require this to happen
well probably probably you can't stop
karma
right the steele dossier probably
made it easier for this to exist because
it looks like
a mirror of the steel steel dossier did
the steele dossier work
i would say it did even though the
the you know impeachment was not
successful in terms of removing them
from office
i think it worked as a political dirty
trick it
totally worked
and i think this will work as well so
it's effective
but let me give you an idea about
what i have a problem with so it's being
described as he had associations that
were problematic
problematic i actually have a chapter in
this book behind me
that says if somebody says something is
problematic
it means they don't have a real reason
all right
problematic is the word you use when
you're trying to paint something as bad
but you don't have a reason because if
you had a reason you wouldn't say
it's problematic you'd say it looks like
somebody could die
it looks like it's expensive there's a
risk here of
something will fall apart those would be
real reasons
his associations were problematic
that's close to a reason that's a
persuasive reason without a reason
let me be clear about something before i
go on
i think there's a lot to worry about in
this report
i think hunter biden has lots to explain
as well as
you know uh joe biden i do think they
need to explain it
but and and it could well turn out that
there's something there that's that's
terrible but i think
i think you're going to find out that
there's more
information than what has been presented
and when you hear the more
information you might say to yourself oh
that sounded a little different when i
first heard it
now there's some things that might be
true that just you don't care there's
some allegations about maybe he paid
money to
prostitutes or something like that but
what was that all about
i mean if he was just paying for the
service of prostitutes
i'm not sure i care right i mean
you can have your opinion on that the
legal system can do what the legal
system needs to do to protect
people but i don't think it makes any
difference to joe biden running for
president
now the other stuff is you know somebody
russian gave him some money
but for what don't you sort of need to
hear some details
yeah is everybody who had a russian
connection
therefore automatically you know dirty
maybe
when the when the vice president's son
is involved it's all sketchy looking
so i will admit i will admit
that it smells in every way that
something can smell
can we all agree on that so you don't
need to convince me
right stop trying to convince me
that that hunter biden did some bad
stuff
you don't need to convince me of that
i'm completely open to that
i i see the same stuff you see it looks
dirty to me but here's my problem with
it
would you want to be treated this way
as a as an american citizen even though
you have a relationship to somebody who
is elected official and might be again
you're not an elected official well
let me let me try this on for her size
if if this kind of a report came out
about don jr just
some unrelated bunch of laundry list
accusations
and he didn't have time or the ability
to defend himself
because of the same problem you can't
just can't defend yourself against the
laundry list
and it's foreign and it's in another
country and it's people who are to get
to
and if you interviewed them there might
be a language problem
you know it's really hard to defend
against this
would you want these kind of accusations
to be made public without the benefit of
an actual crime
being identified that's the key as far
as i know
there is not an identified crime if
there were
i'd say okay that's fair there's an
identified crime
you know still need their day in court
but that's fair
but i don't think there's an identified
crime
there's only a strong suggestion
that if you looked a little harder you'd
find one or you'd find something you
didn't like i don't feel i would be
comfortable
if this had happened to don jr so i'm
going to use the same standard and say
it's going to be effective it'll work
but i'm not sure i want to live in a
country
that would do this to a citizen even as
important as it is to the country
i just don't think that's a good enough
reason to drag
a citizen private citizen even with a
family connection through the mud so
that's just my opinion
i'm i'm aware that many of you will
disagree with that and i'm okay with
that
all right so i suppose we'll be digging
into
what these accusations are i'll read you
some of them
uh he quote formed significant and
consistent financial relationships
with the founder of barisma okay is that
a crime
uh and his partners made millions of
dollars from that association
again is that a crime what what is the
crime that's being alleged
because there aren't too many people at
that level of
you know government or whatever who
don't make money from their associations
the sort of standard business uh even if
it's
dirty all right um people have been
involved in transit
it's all it's all this generic stuff
send funds to non-resident alien women
in the united states who are citizens of
russia and ukraine
who have subsequently wired funds they
have received from hunter
to individuals located in russia and
ukraine
doesn't sound good it doesn't sound good
but don't you need to know a lot more
about this before you
decide that you're going to assassinate
this guy in public
all right so enough about that um
so there's a new information and new
video about the kyle rittenhouse
situation if you didn't see tucker
carlson last night it was
really interesting so i didn't think
there would be any more video about kyle
rittenhouse
but there is and the other information
that we learned now from
his attorneys is that there were four
shots fired that are unaccounted for
in other words four shots fired that
didn't come from kyle's
rifle during the altercation so it's
possible that kyle is not even the
person who shocked
one of the people i think he was yeah in
all likelihood he probably was in
self-defense
but it turns out that when you know more
about it
he is not just likely to be innocent
but he's likely to be closer to being a
hero
than to be guilty he's a little closer
to being a hero
because he you know he came with good
intentions he had his medical bag he had
training his gun was to protect himself
he didn't use his gun until he really
did have to
he even hired he fired a couple of
warning shots when he got chased down in
the street
before he fired anybody he fired two
warning shots in the air and they still
kept coming
and they were armed and they were trying
to kill him
and so he killed one of them and shot
the other one in the arm
but there's a larger point here i feel
as though
it's becoming embarrassingly obvious
that most of these high
profile situations
are fake or at least they're
over interpreted i guess you could say
so here are the ones that i know of
can you fact check me on this the
the officer who shot michael brown did
not get charged
because there was not evidence of a
chargeable crime correct
and that there were big riots about that
it's
looking based on cnn's reporting
that the brianna taylor situation is
going to end with no
murder charge a horrible mistake and
tragedy and probably
the things that the police need to do
differently but it doesn't look
as if this was anything but a horrible
mistake so it doesn't look like murder
so that's probably going to go that way
you've got the george lloyd case which
in my opinion
now that we know he was full of fentanyl
probably those police will not be
charged with murder
or they will not be guilty of murder so
that's not what it looked like
as i mentioned the kyle rittenhouse
situation
looks like he's going to get off i would
be surprised if he didn't get off
and then the jacob blake situation where
the cop shot him seven times when he was
allegedly reaching for a knife in all
likelihood it's going to be shown that
he was reaching for a knife
i don't think those cops will
necessarily be guilty of murder
again there might be some police
procedure thing that they didn't do
right i don't know i'm no expert
but it feels like a pattern now doesn't
it
at what point do the protesters notice
the pattern or do they
do they maybe they don't notice maybe
their reality will continue to be that
these
these were all you know exactly what
they thought
but i feel as though if enough of these
turn out the same way
that the protesters are going to realize
they've been taken
you know you don't have to be fooled too
many times
before you say to yourself ah somebody
is intentionally fooling me
one time after another i mean you could
be pretty gullible
but if you get fooled one time after
another and you realize it
you know you you do figure out that you
were fooled
eventually you're going to figure it out
right
maybe we're getting close to that
have you ever wondered why there are no
personal drones
messing with the protesters there have
to be drones there right
i don't know you know maybe police
drones or whatever but
i'm i'm confused about why there is not
like an army of private drones they're
at the very least trying to get
photographs but at the most
i feel like they could be dropping small
payloads
right can a drone do that can
can you buy a personal drone that could
drop a water balloon
like it wouldn't have it'd have to be
something that's not too heavy
so maybe a water balloon is too heavy
but could you
could you do something that would uh
mark somebody could you drop them
could you drop dye on them for example
could you
spray them with some dye and like if you
see somebody commit a crime
could your drone come in and just just
spray them and then
just back off so that they'd be easier
to catch them later
i don't know i'm just saying i'm just
wondering
how long the protest would go on before
it just becomes obvious that the sky
above them
is going to start to get populated with
drones for a variety of purposes
there might even even be drones fighting
drones who knows
i'm just i'm just wondering what what's
going on
in the sky above those protesters
probably something
probably there are additional
cold cases being solved every day now
the numbers
are starting to increase and the reason
these cold cases are getting solved
is because of the new dna technology
where they can find a family member
if they if they have dna they can find a
family member and
usually from genealogy or other
databases and then once i have a family
member
it's pretty easy to figure out who the
actual suspect is and then
and then find out it's really them uh
this is
the accompany that's behind these is
othram
and i've i've talked to the head of
other david middlemen
on on these periscopes before but it's
fun to actually watch these
start to happen so you're seeing just
one cold case after another get solved
but here's here's the part i've
mentioned this before
there are thousands and thousands of uh
unresolved
rape rape
cases i guess in which they have dna
in what's called a rape kit so that's
the
the term they use in in the business i
guess so the rape kit has the dna
that that is from the perpetrator
but they don't have an identity and if
that person is not in the
um the criminal database then they can't
find them
because the only database that the
police can check
under normal circumstances is criminals
at least in terms of dna but if you use
other
private company they can search dna
anywhere that it's available
and available to them and they can find
a match
so you could you could basically solve
all of the almost all almost all
of the unsolved rape cases that have dna
think about that and you could do that
really quickly
you would just need some kind of federal
support it probably requires i don't
know
might require something like a like a
funding
or or something all right
um what else we got going on here
well those are the main things i wanted
to talk about today
so look at
look at what's going on in the world and
ask yourself this
are most of the people in the united
states still in favor
of being the united states
and the answer is not just most but
overwhelmingly the citizens of the
united states
still want to be the united states there
are very few people
who want to want to destroy the system
was it
what was the guy the ex cnn guy
who said that they need to burn down the
system
if if ginsburg is replaced gonna burn
burn the system or whatever
and everybody said whoa you've gone too
far but if you noticed
that it's only the crazy like fringy
voices that are talking that way
it's not it's not america and it's not
even democrats
it's just sort of some fringy people
talking that way
you will be okay one way or another
you're gonna be okay now i don't know
uh i do think that there's a high
likelihood of the following
certainly there'll be ambiguities about
who won
there will definitely be some ambiguity
about who won but
we will also have a functioning supreme
court
and even though there will be a
conservative majority i think everybody
agrees it's going to happen now mitch
mcconnell is going
to win trump is going to win they have
the votes there will be
there will be somebody on that seat
we'll have a functioning supreme court
and i think the country still respects
the supreme court
and i think that they will sort it out
rezla aslam is the name of the
person who said he wanted to burn it all
down i feel as though
people like that are trying to start
something
meaning they're trying to get other
people to chime in and say yeah
yeah we'll burn it all down and i don't
feel like that happened
i feel like instead people said oh
that's a little too far
that's a little too far why don't you
pull that back a little bit
i'll pull that rhetoric back a little
bit
so i'm not terribly worried about the
future of the country i think we're
going to be fine
if you look at the history of the united
states which by the way is a real useful
thing to do
is to remind yourself how often the
united states
looked like it was on the brink you know
not just
the civil war i mean that was seems like
as big as you can get
but the the civil rights movement the
you know
we've been through a lot we've been
through a lot
this stuff we're going through is not
big
compared to what the united states has
solved in the past
we've solved you know everything from
world wars to
spanish flues to you know great
depressions
you know vietnam war we've we've had
assassinations of presidents we've had 9
11
we've had terror attacks we've been
through a lot
and how how do we do stronger
stronger after every one of those things
every time this country gets tested
we come out stronger the the current set
of tests
while uh impressively varied
and large everything from pandemics to
economies to you know
protest industry than supreme court
drama none of this if you added it all
together
it's not big it's not big
compared to the entire power of the
united states so remember
as long as we decide to be a country we
cannot be defeated
it's only if we decide or we're not sure
if we decide not to that's a problem and
if we're not sure that's a problem
but we are sure and you can almost feel
it in the air
it's like the country has decided okay
we we let everybody speak we let
everybody vent
we listen to everybody but now it's time
to get serious
now it's time to focus a few hundred
years of american
tradition and history and power and
strength
into one election and no matter what
happens in this election
we will sort it out we will sort it out
and we will still have a republic and we
will be fined
slaughter beater is at 200 percent
and pinned unless something really big
happens
really big trump will be reelected
and that's where i think things are
going and i'm going to leave you with
that and i will talk to you
tomorrow
