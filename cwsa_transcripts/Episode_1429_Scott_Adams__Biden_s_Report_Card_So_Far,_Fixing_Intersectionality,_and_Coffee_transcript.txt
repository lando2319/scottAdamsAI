also known as that's right the best time
of the day
not only the best time of the day the
best time of every single day of all the
days there ever was
all the days there ever will be for all
the people who have ever lived and
some people who have never been born
that's how good it is
yeah and if you'd like to enjoy it to
its
maximum potential and why wouldn't you
really all you need is a copper margaret
glasses tanker chelsea's tainack canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's going to happen now all over the
world
making everything better watch go
now quickly quickly compare yeah
everything's better did you see that
it was like just a moment ago everything
in the world was just a little bit worse
and then you take the sip it's immediate
a lot of people say to me scott how long
does it take to kick in
it's immediate you can feel it right
away
well let's talk about the news
i don't want to say that it's a slow
news
time but let's just say that the
excitement we used to get from the news
not as much not as much here's one of
the big stories
there's a robot that can make a pizza
yeah
yeah talk about the golden age and the
actual robot
will you know work up the dough and
flatten it out
and put it on the cooking surface and
put all the stuff
on it and take it away when it's done
you can make 80 pizzas an hour
a robot now that's the good news
the bad news is a lot of people get jobs
preparing food what kind of food
could a robot not make huh
here's one of the big mysteries about
restaurants
and for you know i owned a couple of
restaurants for a while and this was
always the biggest mystery
why is it that all the restaurants
let's say the ones that are italian food
why is it that they don't end up all
serving the same food after a while
because don't they all know how to make
italian food
and and isn't there a cross-pollination
of employees and
recipes and recipes are not even
patentable
you can't even protect a recipe unless
it's a trade secret
so over time shouldn't all the
restaurants be serving
basically the same food because
everybody everybody would figure out
what what is the taste profile that
everybody likes and they would they
would make it that way
but it doesn't happen it's just a weird
kind of thing where
you can't train your employees to make
the food the same way twice
locally the best restaurants are the
ones that have the shortest menu
do you know how that is they have the
shortest menu
so the fewest choices and they never
change the menu
and it's because if you don't do that
the only person who can make the food is
the chef
the cooks won't know how to make the
food if you keep changing it
because they're not as good at you know
keeping up and tasting it as you go
and all that stuff so a robot that makes
food
could get us to the point where all our
food is good all the time
because if humans make your food
sometimes good sometimes not but if the
robots start doing it
it's going to be amazing and then the
robots get networked and then they
share information about the sales and
suddenly the
robots know exactly what people buy more
of
so all the robots start immediately
conforming to whatever
people buy the most of yeah the
the even the simple area of the food
you're eating
is likely to go from hey most of the
time the food i eat is pretty good
all the way to robots making your food
perfectly every time
food is going to get really really
really good
like so good you almost wouldn't believe
it if you had
a.i and you rapid testing
network the robots together and make
them make the same food every time
it's going to be good all right so it
looks like eric adams
is on track to win the mayor mayoral
mayoral mayoral contest
in new york city so what do you win the
primary or something
but they think he's going to win he's
the favorite and here's the interesting
part
you're waiting for the interesting part
yeah you are the interesting part
is that he's running on a anti-crime
platform so you're worried about the
slippery slope well here's why i
generally don't worry about
slippery slopes because when things slip
far enough there's usually almost always
a counter force and here's a perfect
example
eric adams is the counter force the
public had enough
they said well you've slipped far enough
in this crime direction
and now we're done and now we're going
to fix it
all right so i think that's a good sign
for the country
it seems to me that the number of
protests is way down right
you're not seeing black lives matter
protesting what happened to antifa
did antifa disband or did anti-fog get
everything they wanted
what exactly happened to antifa did did
all of their concerns
end up being addressed did everything
that antifa and black lives matter
wanted did it all happen so they don't
need to protest this summer
no i don't think so is this the first
summer
where no cops killed a black
motorist who had been stopped
did we get lucky and this year cops
stopped killing people
during stops what happened to all of
that
was all of that real
how much of that was organic
was black lives matter and antifa were
they completely divorced
from the political process because
if they were divorced from the political
process in other words they had nothing
to do with who was president or
who was running for president if they
simply had
demands what happened to those demands
because they haven't been mad right
and and uh anti-fun black lives matter
don't even have the same demands
so what happened
do you remember the wall street uh the
the one percenter
um protests you know the the occupy wall
street stuff
do you remember what they were
complaining about it was uh income
inequality did that get fixed
do you remember when there was all this
income inequality and then it got
fixed so we don't need to have any more
protests no it got much worse
the income inequality got way worse but
the protests
disappeared so
how much of these protests are real
if they seem to come and go independent
of the issues that they are allegedly
protesting
doesn't that suggest that these are
artificial groups
and that their leaders at least are
being influenced by some kind of outside
force
i would think so i'm not sure you could
say that there's any chance that's not
true
because things got really quiet
once biden became president so
cnn is reporting that according to polls
47 percent of americans believe the
country is going in the right direction
and that's good for president joe biden
they say and it's higher than trump at
the same time
and it's the highest since obama pretty
good right
wow almost half of the country
says the that that we're going in the
right direction
now let me ask you a question
if you're just coming out of a pandemic
aren't you always going in the right
direction
what exactly would have had to go wrong
for us to be coming out of a pandemic
with all the economic growth that
naturally comes with that
how could you possibly not be going in
the right direction
and still half of the country thinks
we're not
you could be brain dead as president
and we'd be going in the right direction
right now
because you always are when you come out
of the command of the bottom
if we were coming out of a depression
we'd be going in the right direction
if you come out of a war you're going in
the right direction
if you come out of a pandemic you're
probably going in the right direction
so how hard was it for our brain dead
president to lead us in the right
direction
he just had to show up that's it
whoever was in president whoever was the
president today
was going to be going in the right
direction it'd be pretty hard to get any
worse
after a pandemic but that's uh the cover
of course
that cnn gives to the left
there there are more polls which we'll
get to in a moment
i like that uh cnn is now calling
january
6 that protest at the capitol they
started calling it
the insurrection so it would sound more
illegal
and and more dangerous but now they've
added a new
qualifier now it's a deadly insurrection
now it was deadly so that that word does
fit i'm not going to argue that the word
is inappropriate
but i love the branding job that cnn
does
it's no longer just an insurrection
now it's that deadly insurrection do you
know why the
deadly insurrection happened because of
the big lie
so cnn has learned from trump
how to brand things and they're doing it
really well
if i'm being objective they're doing a
really really good job with this
branding stuff that
that whole big lie was really good
branding that was almost as good as
um you know low energy jeb and
you know uh crook and hillary so this is
another one of uh trump's
lasting legacies that that
his enemies if you will cnn they learned
to use his trick the branding and it
works it's really good
all right uh here's a
point it was a doctor i think on fox
news making this point
if the reason that we had so many
restrictions during the pandemic
was primarily to keep the hospitals from
being slammed
and we know now that even if you get
covered when you're vaccinated you're
probably not going to go to the hospital
even if you're not vaccinated and you
get covered
you're probably going to get the really
good therapeutics now that also keep you
out of the hospital
so i believe that we have solved
the hospital impact problem does anybody
disagree with that
could we say with certainty is or is it
too soon
but can we say with certainty that at
least the hospital
overrun problem is that part
solved like like for sure everybody
would agree with that statement
or are there still some people who think
that maybe we could
we could crush the hospitals if there's
a new surge
i think we're past that right because
even the therapeutics are so good
and most of the people who would die are
already vaccinated
right yeah and you could argue that the
hospital impact was
solved um in the winter because that
would have been the peak and we got past
that okay
so the biggest reason for the you know
the
lockdowns and the masking and stuff no
longer exists
and the fact that we're even talking
about masking up again
that that's even a question we're done
with this right
everybody everybody would does it matter
to you what your government tells you
about masks
going forward because i don't think
we're in the mood to comply
i was definitely in the mood to comply
in the beginning of the pandemic
because i think reasonably you know
strategy wise
uh going with the experts in the fog of
war probably is better than just
guessing
on your own so in the in the beginning
of the pandemic there were real reasons
and we were trying to keep
the hospitals from being crushed and
keep grandma alive and all that
but we're really done with that
we're done with that even even people
who are relatively pro-mask
i think we're all done now so or enough
of us are done
that they couldn't possibly uh make this
mandate stick i don't think
i don't think there's any chance of
masks coming back but i could be wrong
so i saw i saw a tweet that i thought
was fake
this morning but i'm being told is real
if i'm
wrong about this could you correct me
that there's a
twitter user named tom lycus l-e-y-k-i-s
many of you have probably seen him
tweets about politics
does not like republicans did not like
trump one bit
i've had some unpleasant encounters with
him on twitter i think he blocked me
finally or i blocked him or something
so a very very unpleasant fellow
but did he really tweet this because i
have a question
i'm seeing people saying it's real and
it's on his timeline
but it's hard to believe so that he
tweeted a story about a race car
crashing in georgia
and killing an audience member a fresh
story
right just happened an audience member
just died in georgia
and he tweets one less trump supporter
what one less trump supporter
somebody just died in the audience when
a car hit him
now didn't georgia go democrat
who exactly thinks that if you're in the
crowd in georgia that you're necessarily
republican
in 2021 so first of all
the assumption is kind of hanky but
second of all
ah this is pretty bad remember i got a
lot of
a lot of grief for predicting last year
that if biden got elected republicans
would be hunted
and people said come on that's too far
and here there's a public figure who is
cheering the death
of a trump supporter in public and as
far as i know
he will not be banned on social media
that's right that you could say in
public that you're glad for the death
of a republican and apparently that
would be okay
now i also think that you know we
shouldn't be censoring
so much but there is a little bit of a
double standard here and
this is short of republicans being
hunted
but how many republicans keep their head
down and don't admit
their political affiliation at work
if republicans are hiding
it's sort of like being hunted it's
getting close to it all right
so rasmussen asked
its uh people it polled likely voters he
said
is uh biden's immigration policy better
or worse
than trump now correct me if i'm wrong
one of the biggest reasons that
biden ran for president is to improve
the immigration policy wouldn't you say
that would be a fair statement
you know very close to the top of the
reasons for biden to run
was to fix immigration
35 35 of those polled said that biden's
doing better
oh 35 that's not bad
oh but 49 say he's doing worse
that's right 49 of the country far more
than the people who say is doing better
say he's doing worse now i tell you
again
this is why he ran for president it was
one of the top
five reasons right maybe we should look
at some of his other performance
let's find out if the reasons that biden
ran
are holding up now you remember that
although trump was famous for failing
the fact-checking
he had this strange quality for a
politician
which was he kept his promises it was
it's the strangest combination of in one
person
if we ever had a president who
continuously failed the fact-checking
as trump did you know even if you're a
supporter i think you have to
you have to accept that his hyperbole
was you know consistently failing the
fact-checking
but at the same time and the same person
i don't think anybody did a better job
of keeping his campaign promises
now when i say keeping his promises i
mean he at least tried really hard
right he didn't get the wall built but
he put
all the effort into it i mean he
definitely kept his promises
like maybe nobody ever has so
what was the point of electing biden
well let's see
here's some here's what i feel was his
his main
selling points honesty
right one of the main things that biden
wanted to bring was
honesty how is that working out well the
washington post
gives biden administration three
pinocchios
for claiming that republicans are the
ones who voted to defund the police
what republicans voted to defund the
police
just completely made up out of nothing
and this is coming from the biden
administration
so remember one of the reasons he ran
was to get more honesty so that didn't
work out right
so even the washington post is saying
well we didn't get
that right so that was one reason
honesty
didn't get that um better immigration
policy no
didn't get that because half of the
country says it's worse
how about uh better handling of iran you
know the iran nuclear deal
especially russia and china
would you say that biden has done a
better job than trump
handling iran russia and china
i don't think anybody thinks that right
you at the very least it's not better
so those reasons for electing biden
don't hold
we're probably in more danger from iran
they're being more aggressive not less
russia seems to be more aggressive not
less and
china is china right nothing anybody
does changes anything they do
so that reason didn't hold up there was
of course
famously the fine people hoax he
literally ran for president
mentioning the fine people hoax as if it
were real
he actually ran one of his i would say
top
five reasons you could argue it's the
top one
wasn't even real and the fact checkers
confirmed that
it just didn't even happen and that was
one of his main reasons so that didn't
work out
how about improving the respect for the
u.s
presidency because remember how bad it
was when
the g7 may have laughed at trump behind
his back
and certainly you don't want to live in
a country where people are
where people are actually you don't want
to live in a country where
sorry i just read a comment and just
completely lost my
uh thought okay the respect for the u.s
presidency
yeah you don't want to live in a country
where other countries don't respect your
president
so how's that working out do you think
that the other leaders are looking at
the videos of joe biden
barely being sentient and saying to
themselves
wow looks like the united states finally
got themselves a
competent leader got rid of that donald
trump guy
and now they've got this strong joe
biden leader that we don't laugh at at
all
well that didn't happen right there is
no way in the world
that the leaders are not at least
raising an eyebrow about biden's
intellectual
capacity so
they laughed out loud at him at the g7
do you think they're laughing out loud
at uh biden behind his back
i think they are i think they are
oh or were you talking about biden that
they laughed at out loud
yeah i believe that there was a story
about that
all right what else uh uh biden also ran
on following the science right how is
that working now
is the biden administration following
that science
with their let's say their mask mask
ideas
and the how about wearing a mask on an
airplane
do you think that the requirements of
vaccinated people
having to take a covet test before they
got an airplane
is that based on science no
no of course not so
so listen to this list i'll just read
them to you again and
not one of these things that biden
promised us
is even close to happening we don't have
more honesty in the presidency we don't
have better immigration
we don't have better handling of iran
russia or china
the fine people hoax of course was a
hoax we don't have really more respect
for the us presidency
you know it's a different set of
complaints but
nobody's going to respect what they're
seeing at biden
and we're not following the science and
we're obviously not doing it
so there you go all right that's the
biden's
report card not looking good so here's a
persuasion tip that i go to
quite often and the persuasion tip is
this
if there's something happening let's say
a policy or a
set of ideas that you think are absurd
and you're arguing against them have you
noticed it never works
that if you just take a position against
whatever somebody's for
nothing happens they're still for it
you're arguing against it no difference
but as i've taught you if an idea is
genuinely absurd
like it's genuinely just bad crazy
then the way to kill it is by agreeing
with it
that's how you kill it if if an idea is
fairly solid
but maybe you think you have a different
way that's even better
you can't use that approach because you
can't add to a solid idea to kill it
it was a solid idea if you support it it
gets stronger
but if an idea is absurd just like
bat crazy absurd the way
you kill it
is by supporting it let me give you
let me give you a concrete um example
you've heard of intersectionality it's a
component of
a critical race theory i think that's
fair to say that it's always included in
that
in that set of teachings and
intersectionality it took me a while to
figure out what the hell that was all
about
but it has to do with the fact that you
could be
discriminated against for more than one
thing
so for example if you're black in
america you could be discriminated
against for being black
but suppose you were black and also
female
well that's something else to be
discriminated against so you're black
and you're female you got two things to
be discriminated
for but what if you're black
and female and a lesbian you've got
three things
to be discriminated about and if you
understand
intersectionality you would be able to
you know understand these situations in
their
uniqueness and apparently the teaching
of intersectionality is considered
important so people can really see
you know the nuance of all the
discrimination that's going on
now suppose you didn't like that
and you wanted to kill it how would you
kill it with kindness
in other words how can you kill it by
agreeing with it
and the the obvious answer is you add
categories because they're completely
valid
if we're going to talk about all of the
ways that people are discriminated
against
which is the whole point of
intersectionality right the point of it
is you're not leaving anything out
it's like all the discrimination you're
not just
black you might be black and
you know gay right so that's the whole
point
so let's add some things in there what
are some other
things that people are commonly
discriminated against
in the united states that would be
important for children to learn
all right how about being a republican
is there anybody who is
discriminated against for being a
republican
and the answer is yeah i mean i just
gave you an example the tom lycus
example
that somebody could say in public that
they're glad you died
could you say that about a black person
in the united states on a social media
platform in 2021
if you expressed happiness that a person
of any ethnic group
had died could you do that no
no you but you could do it with a
republican tom lycus just did it he's
still on twitter
right so i think that's fair to say that
if you're a republican you would be
the subject to great discrimination by
some people
now obviously people who are like
whatever group you're talking about are
not going to discriminate
republicans are not going to
discriminate against republicans
but you know gay people don't
discriminate against gay people so
that's just
what we expect how about white people
are there any white people who ever
experience
any discrimination well yes yes
it's completely different and if you're
going to say scott scott scott
these are not equal i would say i'm not
saying they're equal
i'm saying that intersectionality is
including everything
you gotta you gotta throw everything in
there that's the whole point it does
you're not
weighing them i'm not saying that gay is
better or worse
than you know black or latinx or
whatever
i'm just saying they all need to be
there we're not comparing
so if you say to me white people don't
get much discrimination compared to
these other groups
maybe maybe not it doesn't matter it's
not relevant to the question of whether
it should be included
because there's still so much of it all
right
i've lost two jobs for being white and
male
uh if anybody doesn't know my story
there
prior to becoming the dilbert cartoonist
i worked for two big corporations and
both of them called me in
on separate days of course and they both
told me in direct language
that i couldn't be promoted because i'm
white and
male now when i say direct language i
mean
they said it directly you
scott can't be promoted because you're
white
because you're male i'm not reading
between the lines
they said that directly and it was
official policy
all right how many people in today's
world
have lost a job because uh
their their company wanted more uh
diversity
because that was the situation in my
case they just wanted more diversity and
senior management
how many white people have lost a job
because of that look at the comments
there are people in the comments saying
that they did
lots and lots and lots of white people
have been discriminated against
now am i am i crying do you hear any
violins
do you do you hear any violins
and let me say this as clearly as
possible
if you're objecting to me saying that
white people are discriminated against
 you just you
that's all i have to say about that
because if you care about other people
being discriminated against
but you don't care about the white
people who are
routinely discriminated against less
i'm not comparing i'm not saying it's
like slavery
right i'm not saying that i'm not saying
it's like the native americans being
kicked off their ancestral lands
i'm not comparing i'm just saying it's
real
and if we're going to include all all
the discrimination categories
this is in the list or you right
anybody who doesn't think that white
people are discriminated against
massively in this country you
you're just an right but again
i will accept that if you were ranking
them
you you wouldn't necessarily rank them
the same
we're on the same page there how about
short people
we have plenty of science that says
short people are discriminated against
in many ways especially economically how
about politically
yeah it matters so let's put short
people on the list
because i think our children need to
learn
not to discriminate against short people
how about bald people do i re do i ever
get discriminated
against for being hair challenged
of course of course have i ever been
insulted in public for being bald
on here in live stream
almost every week i i
am mocked in public for a physical
element of my being that i have no
control over
is that cool yeah are we going to let
school children learn that
i say no and how about gingers
do gingers ever get discriminated
against yes
yes they do let's throw that on the list
children need to learn about that
about uh christians has anybody ever
been
discriminated against for being a little
too religious
yes we're in the united states
we'll discriminate against anything too
religious
not religious enough wrong religion
don't practice your religion right you
look like a hypocrite to me
yeah all that stuff so throw religion in
there for sure
and christians in particular how about
dumb people
are dumb people ever discriminated
against
yes dumb people are the one category
that we all discriminate against because
we're all smart right
you're lucky lucky us lucky us
that everybody on this live stream are
the smart ones
good job us but do we make fun of dumb
people
yeah all the time is that fair
was anybody did anybody choose to be
below average in intelligence nope
nope nobody ever filled out an
application said yes i think i'd like to
be below
average in intelligence no you're just
born that way
and we and we mock people like that
let's put that on the list
intersectionality
how about the rich are the rich
ever discriminated against for just
being rich
and the answer is yes yes now
again would you rather be rich
or to have you know some other problem
well you'd rather be rich
being rich is way better than being poor
no doubt about it
so again we're not comparing things for
which one is worse
which would be absurd in itself we're
just saying that there is discrimination
against rich people
and let's put it on the list how about
age is there such a thing as age
discrimination yes
massively massively do you think you can
uh
do you think at my age if i weren't you
know the famous dilbert guy
do you think of my age i could walk into
a startup and they'd hire me
just like that no no age discrimination
is
gigantic so here's what you do with
intersectionality
you embrace it to death
you say it's incomplete because it does
not include
enough categories of intersectionality
it needs to be expanded
not killed because you could expand it
to the point where it disappears
in other words if you were to treat it
seriously it would just disappear
because everybody is discriminated
against one way or another
it really is there anybody who's not
discriminated against
if you're young beautiful and white
and let's say you're a female you're
young
beautiful white rich and female
do you get discriminated against yeah
yeah a lot is it as bad
as some other category of discrimination
you know we'll say gays or black
whatever
i don't know i doubt it but again
we're not comparing we're just saying
that if you're discriminated against
we should teach kids not to do it
all right um
yeah oh and blondes blondes are
discriminated against
um again i don't think that's the
biggest problem in the world but
uh yeah i did lock the cat out again i
closed the door sorry you won't see boo
the cat
well there was a uh assassination in
haiti
uh i didn't think that kind of stuff
happened anymore but apparently
a bunch of mercenaries foreign
mercenaries attacked the presidential
compound
and assassinated the president i
i honestly i didn't know that was
something that could happen like why did
the president of haiti
had such bad security that
a smallish band of mercenaries could
take over the capital and murder him
i feel like there was a security issue
there
so maybe there was some insider stuff
um well i guess that story is developing
so that's pretty horrible but we'll wait
and see what's happening
on that on vaccinations biden's talking
about going
community by community and door to door
do you have a problem with that i'm
seeing the way it's being received
on the right is that people are saying
you're not going to knock on my door and
force me to get a vaccination
but i don't think that's the problem is
it isn't the problem
that they're looking to solve uh a
little bit more about
access and maybe a little persuasion but
nobody's gonna arrest you
if you didn't get a vaccination right
you're not going to get do you really
think that the slippery slope is going
to get to the point where
if you don't get the vaccination um
you can't participate in society or
something
i know i think there will be too many
unvaccinated people for you to worry
about
long-term discrimination i think short
term there will be an advantage to being
vaccinated in terms of social access
but it's probably a few months
um someone's going to shoot them
somebody
i'm saying in the comments well i hope
not because i i feel as though the
people who are going to be knocking on
the doors
are not going to be you know gestapo
when somebody knocks on the door it's
going to be you know a nice man and
woman
who say hey you know in case you had
trouble getting access we have some
vaccinations
you know can we talk you into it i feel
like it's going to be a very pleasant
encounter
for with people who are genuinely trying
to help
i don't feel like it's the beginning of
you know kristallnacht
or something it doesn't feel like the
beginning of the end to me
now i understand why it would make you
uncomfortable
i i can see your discover in the uh in
the comments
but remember we're a very armed country
can you imagine them trying to do forced
vaccinations
door-to-door with the number of guns
that we have in this country
i don't think you have to worry about it
i really don't
i mean part of being pro-gun pro-second
amendment let's say
part of being second amendment is you
really kind of don't have to worry about
this
right the the benefit of being a
massively
gun owning country is that you don't
really need to worry about this
it's just going to look like an option
and
and i do think that there's a worry that
some people will be persuaded that maybe
wouldn't have been persuaded otherwise
and you have to wonder about
you know free will and all that so there
is a moral
moral and ethical line that needs to be
you know
attended to quite rigorously but
i don't think it's going to be a big
deal
let me tell you the the way it's being
handled in one business that i will not
mention
so there's a local business that has a
set of covered rules you're supposed to
do this and that
and they almost tell you directly that
they're not going to enforce it
so we're reaching a point where
businesses are going to say
masks are required or
sterilizing surfaces or whatever but
we're not going to kick you out if you
don't
and we're not going to say anything if
you don't so i think that's where we're
we're sliding into a situation where
we'll have the rules
but no enforcement because the business
owner will say you know
i don't need to make enemies and there's
no science to support enforcing this
rule
so i'm just not going to do it it's not
my job
it's just not the business owner's job
to enforce the rules and i think that
they are quite reasonably saying
we'll tell you what the rules are i'll
tell you what the rules are
but it's up to you we're not going to
force them
all right
um how many of your uh
predictions have come true so far
i was saying since the beginning that
you shouldn't worry too much about your
individual rights being eroded by the
pandemic
because everyone wants the pandemic to
be temporary
and i still feel that that's going to be
the case there won't be any
i don't think you're going to see a
permanent loss of any rights
based on on the pandemic and i think
that
all indications are that we'll just come
out of it okay
um new rule
okay yeah and i've noticed that the
grocery stores
stopped using uh gloves and the grocery
stores stopped using masks
so the the newest thing everybody's
talking about is
the newest thing is that if you're
vaccinated you can still get
coronavirus now is that being reported
as bad news or good news
you know the famous queen quote
the mark twain quote is uh that humans
can't tell the difference between good
news and bad news
and when you first hear that you say to
yourself well that's not true
everybody can tell the difference
between good news and bad news
how do you not tell the difference
between that
and then you see a million examples and
this is one
if you told me that vaccinated people
could still get coronavirus
is that bad news because the vaccinated
are not going to have a hard time with
it
you know the exception would be somebody
who's so close to death with their
comorbidities
yeah that's bad news for them but for
the average person
let's say me i'm fully vaccinated
suppose i also get coronavirus i'm not
going to have any symptoms
and my my immunity will increase
do i not want that am i worse off
if i have the vaccination and immunity
isn't the best possible situation to get
to actually get the coronavirus while
you're vaccinated
i feel like that makes you better off
now worse off because i'm not going to
get the symptoms
i pro almost certainly not going to get
a long haul
anything i'll just be more immune
and i don't even believe i can give it
to people you know
statistically speaking the odds of even
giving to somebody are
just vanishingly small now i heard a
statistic
that only 15 1 5
15 of married people who were infected
even gave the virus to a spouse which
means we don't understand something
about this virus i don't know what it is
but only 15 percent gave it to a spouse
how is that possible doesn't your common
sense say that should be well over
50 but 15
this yeah there's something deeply
mysterious about this
but if you add in the fact that only 15
of your closest
human beings even get it and then you
add the vaccination to it
i'm not really worried about having the
infection and then giving it to somebody
else
because the amount of shedding i would
have as a vaccinated person would be
almost nothing
so those were probably false positives
somebody says it could be
how many people who have a positive
don't get a second test though
do most people i i don't know the answer
that
um yes and i'm going to double down on
my
uh attempt to get the nobel prize in
science
or medicine i don't care and i'm going
to say it again
i have a hypothesis that there are two
kinds of immunity to this virus
and maybe other viruses too but let's
just limit it to this
two kinds of immunity and this is just a
hypothesis
one kind of immunity is the kind that
you can see
and test so you do a test you test the
antibodies and there they are
i've got specific antibodies for this
virus that's one kind of immunity
my hypothesis is there's another kind
that's undetectable
and the other kind that's undetectable
would be and i'm going to use an analogy
instead of building a fence that maybe
you could detect because you could just
look at it say oh there's a fence
there's maybe another kind of immunity
that's more like getting the
materials together and stockpiling them
and just being
immediately ready if you need to build
defense
so i feel as if there's something we
can't quite
identify that gives you some kind of
pre-immunity
or a little bit of safety that's not
quite immunity
that gives you a leg up and
i'm seeing lots of strange comments here
and thank you jack
um t-cell immunity is well known and
measurable
i'm hearing someone say pittsburgh i
cannot answer this call
sorry pittsburgh um but i'm not talking
about that
because the t cell immunity is known
what i'm talking about is that there's
literally something that can't be
measured
not in t cells and not in anything that
we've measured yet
and that we're somehow
more prepped but not immune so that's
what i think
and i think that and furthermore
i'm going to say that maybe the reason
that summer
shows a reduction in the virus is that
so many people
are getting small doses of viral load
enough to maybe alert their immune
system but not enough to create an
immunity that can
be measured so it could be
that the very best thing for the country
is tiny
exposure to the virus all year round
so our bodies are sort of primed but not
necessarily immune
that is my hypothesis and i will fully
expect
to win the nobel prize in science or
medicine
i'm open to either one
all right i gotta go do some other
things
but it has been a pleasure as always
and i hope that you will uh have the
best day
you've ever had this week and it starts
now
and i will talk to you youtube tomorrow
