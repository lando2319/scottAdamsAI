then it's a right-wing white adult male
who is republican-leaning
who was activated by the press you know
he was weaponized by the press he is not
a very good bomb maker he does not have
an advanced education high school
education tops and maybe not even that
and that is not a good bomb maker
alright bad design so that's why we know
for now so you have my prediction it's
an adult white Republican leaning guy
who doesn't know how to make a bomb or
didn't mean them to go off they could
have been intentionally fake he could
have been making a point but we'll see
you
