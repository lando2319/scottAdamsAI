good morning everybody
and welcome
to the best thing that's ever happened
to anybody in the entire world since the
beginning of time it's called coffee
with scott adams
there will be no finer experience
today
but tomorrow is looking good and if you
want to take it to levels that no human
has ever experienced in the history of
coffee wisconsin all you have to do is
grab a
cup or a margarita glasses tanker
chelsea stein the canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind then fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called
that's right the simultaneous up
it happens now go
oh so good
well let's talk about all the news
uh once again today
dilbert is running another
esg themed comic
and you'd probably like me to read it to
you wouldn't you
yeah i know you would
i know you would
and it goes a little something like
oh okay there it is
looked like it was going to be a
technical problem but no
so here uh dog bird is just talking to
dilbert
at a table and uh dilbert says
what is this esg thing i keep hearing
about and dogber says imagine if a
crooked politician and a crooked
financial advisor got married and had a
baby
and dilber says
so esg would be that baby
and dogbear says only if it is colicky
and has fire hose diarrhea
now
who would retweet
a comic like that
who would who would be so low-born
so much a
person of the people
that they would retweet
such a controversial cartoon well one of
them is a senator tom cotton
who tweeted it this morning
and he said
he said congratulations to blackrock and
larry fink
for appearing in today's dilbert and you
know well done scott adams so
here's what i was trying to do
i i did want
this is exactly what i wanted
i i wanted to raise the profile of esg
and i want to create the following
thought in people's mind
and their thought goes like this
nobody knows exactly what esg is right
[Laughter]
you know what the letters are and maybe
you worked at a company where they were
implementing it so you saw it up close
but it's kind of big and unwieldy and
complicated and ambiguous and hard to
define and it might be morphing and
changing and nobody's quite sure exactly
what's in and what's out and how would
you measure any of this anyway
so it's this big amorphous cloud
so it's hard to say anything good about
it or anything bad about it
because you can't actually
talk about it
in any way that anybody would understand
because it's just too big right too big
and too many
it's like three different topics that
they melded together into this
souffle of god knows what
now
here's the only thing that people will
know
when i'm done
you ready for this this is the only
thing the public will know
a giant company called blackrock
thinks it's a good idea
and the dilbert cartoonist
thinks it's
that's it
because if i if i tried to get an
argument about the details
how well is that going to go right
everybody gets lost in the details and
nobody understands anything but if you
just understand two things there's a big
giant company
that thinks it's a terrific idea
and there's the guy who makes the
dilbert comic
who says it's a
it's a bad idea
so good luck we'll see if we can kill
this by the end of the year now kill it
just means try to
let's say try to
bully it into something that we can live
with
i'm certainly not against
you know the environment
i'm not against the environment i'm not
against companies
doing things that are good for the
environment i'm not against having good
governance i think it's a good idea to
have your governance
as much as you can
you know reflect the public and your
customers and
even your employees
so
just to be clear
i don't have any problem with the
objectives of esg you get that right
like the things that they're asking for
just seem like good generic things
it's just the way it's done it's always
the way it's done the thing i make fun
of is always the way it's done
when i make fun of management
am i saying that companies should not be
managed
of course not i'm only making fun of the
way it's done right
so
so that's my beat it's not about the
idea it's about how it's implemented and
here specifically is why it's a problem
because the people pushing esg
what is the one thing that they're not
concerned with
what is the one thing they're not
concerned with if they're pushing esg
the profitability of the company
so you need somebody who's in charge of
all the variables
you can't outsource some of the
variables to another party
that's not a management structure that
can work
in the long run right you can it's
always going to be a drag on everything
and then on top of that
if you just by the way that's that's all
the argument you need is you can't take
management's control of all the
variables where they're balancing well
profit's good
environment's good yeah we're gonna
make some calls here
now obviously you don't want them doing
profits over the environment
but there's probably
some balance there that we're not
exactly hitting quite right
so generally speaking you want the
people who are in charge to be able to
control all the variables or else
or else you don't get a good result
would you agree with that
if the people running the company
are not the ones who can control which
variables are important and which ones
get priority and which ones don't it's
not really managed
they're just victims of outside forces
at that point
so it's a clever sort of back door way
to introduce a form of
maybe some form of i don't know
cousin of socialism or
something i'm not sure exactly what but
it effectively would take some control
away from the people have control
and and sort of give it to the people in
a way
if you think the people want esg
and the people do i mean everybody wants
a good environment they don't
necessarily want it this way
all right
remember i told you uh that youtube has
this app called youtube tv and it's an
amazing app it had only one problem
which is the the network that didn't
work and of all and of all the content
on there
the only thing that didn't work was fox
news
and it never worked
and and youtube tv tweeted back at me
and said
you know maybe you should uninstall your
app and reinstall
and
you know because i
i wasn't born yesterday
that never works
especially when you've used it on like
five different devices and you get the
same result
you know especially a brand new phone
this week same result all the other
channels are fine just that one channel
right so
it's not impossible
that somehow the problem was on my andro
is just a technical problem it's not
impossible
anything's possible
but let's uh open it up this morning
see if it works we'll give you a live
demonstration
of youtube tv
which has not once been able to show the
five without glitching
let's see what it does after i
complained
they are probably going to get oh
it's all fixed
um
so one day not even one day but
basically the same day that i
publicly called it out
is the first day
that has worked perfectly
how about that
don't you love your coincidences
quite a coincidence wasn't it
by the way do you know how i got their
attention
did you did you notice that how i got
their attention
so i mean not only that i did this
publicly but i tweeted it
but did you catch the
the most clever thing i did to get their
attention
i don't know if you caught it
so i did it yesterday on the live stream
now the clever thing i did was
and and this has to be honest so i don't
recommend lying i never recommend lying
with persuasion so if if you think i'm
saying that i'm not
here here was the persuasion that i
think was
maybe not the key but it was important
i i said that the people who developed
the ut tv did a great job
they really did
it's it's one of the best apps
that i've experienced in terms of the
user interface
speed
technical
excellence etc
so it was it sort of stood out that this
one channel wasn't working
now it could be that it was a technical
problem
because they said there was something
wrong with at one point i heard there
was something wrong with the feed maybe
and maybe maybe they just solved the
technical problem
so i don't know for sure there was any
you know strange bias or anything like
that could have been
could have been just a technical problem
but in any case it got fixed
so
so i don't know what uh percentage of
total tv traffic
the youtube tv app has
yeah
fox news
probably just gained one or two percent
in
in ratings you're welcome you're welcome
so they say one person can't make a
difference
how many times have you seen me change
something
and by the way i don't know for sure if
that wasn't a coincidence it could have
been
you could never really rule out
coincidence can you
all right
um
so tick tock uh apparently tick tock is
not
guaranteeing
that they will keep their data away from
china so china tick tock is a
chinese-owned company which means the
government of china has control over
them
and we don't want our american user data
to get in chinese hands
but tick tock says well you know we we
can't really promise that there's no
situation whatsoever where they won't
get your data
yeah and us you know what's the funniest
thing about this story
is it's a it's a complete it's a
complete
diversion
look at my left hand
don't pay attention to my right hand
look at my left hand your user data
oh
let's worry about the user data hey look
over here the user data might get in the
wrong hands
look here user data
what about no no no no there's nothing
else let's talk about the user data
what are we forgetting
how about the fact that the entire
product is designed as
a user interface
for brains
it's a user interface
for programming brains
now it's also other things it's
entertaining it's social media it's all
those things
but
by its nature
i'm not sure if it's by design but by
its nature
you can
figure out what people like
you can give them more of it
and do you know how persuasion works let
me explain it to you you hear the main
things that will persuade you
number one
repetition
the more you see the same message the
more you think it's true or the more you
think it's important both of those so
can the tick tock interface
algorithm decide who gets more of
something
yes
that's the basic element of brainwashing
what information
goes to whom
and how often and how much of it right
now what's the second element of
persuasion
association
association
can tick doc make sure that it
associates the message with let's say
couching it in between
a bunch of things that are going to make
you happy and feel good and you think
are true
what would that do to the message that's
sandwiched between things that you love
and make you happy and put you in a good
mood
and also you think are true and
meaningful and important and they stick
that one little thing in there that you
didn't have an opinion on yet what
happens to it
well the goodness from the things around
it
and the feelings associated with those
other things now are
associated with a new thing
so tick tock
has a user interface that can control
the quantity and frequency and the
association
now what else do you need for
what else do you need for
persuasion
feedback
one of the most important things and
often under
underappreciated when a hypnotist does
hypnosis in person
a big part of the process maybe half of
it is observing whether the thing you're
doing is working
and if it's not working you change you
try something else see if that works
change see if that works
now that's why you can't learn hypnosis
by reading a book
because reading a book won't let you see
the change that's happening
right so you're not there in person
you know in theory i suppose you could
practice and observe but it doesn't
really work too well
so now you've got
so you've got
frequency you've got association
now how and feelings so they can control
your feelings
um what about
what what are the strongest
bits of uh persuasion what is the number
one strongest persuasion
fear
fear
is tick tock able
to um let's say decide that you will see
more things that might be scary
or fewer things that might be scary they
can control that right they have control
over
if you see more scary stuff about let's
say a topic
yes they can let's take climate change
they can completely control
how much fear their customers see
or experience
so now they can control that now what's
the next most important part of
persuasion after fear
well i often talk about the the high
ground approach but the high ground
doesn't really apply in social media
this is more of an argument thing social
media is more of a fire hose so the high
ground doesn't really come into play on
that
the next thing that's important is
visual persuasion
visual
tic tocs visual
so they got visual they got fear they've
got
control over that how much you see
what it's associated with what time you
see it they can even control the time of
day
don't you think that the time of day
would determine how ex how acceptable a
message is
it would
i've never studied it but i guarantee it
right there's nothing i've even ever
looked into
but i guarantee it the time of day
and based on what else you're doing at
that time
completely determines how open you are
to a suggestion right
everything from you know how hungry you
are to how sleepy you are
all of those things work into whether
you're open to be suggestible
so now tick tock knows what's working
and what doesn't because it can observe
you directly
it knows if you're clicking on or
watching something more or less
it has every element
of the human interface
for programming a brain
there's nothing missing
let me say that again there's no feature
missing
they hit every note
every note
if you were if you were a expert in
persuasion and you said all right let's
develop a thing to program somebody's
mind
you would develop tick doc
that's the exact product you would make
if you were designing a
if you were designing a brainwashing
tool
it would be tick-tock
it wouldn't remind you of it it would be
it
let me say that again it wouldn't be
similar to it wouldn't remind you of
it would be tick tock
if you designed a brainwashing tool
because what's more important than
having all your friends also being
brainwashed at the same time
nothing
nothing
so that's the next element the the
social element of it that you're part of
a team and the team's doing the same
thing you are is super persuasive i
should have put that one maybe at the
top
you know i don't think of that one
because i usually think of a one-on-one
persuasion i don't think so that one
escaped me but i should have said that's
near the top or at the top
that it looks like you're on a team and
the team is awesome and aren't you glad
you're on that team and whatever that
team says is what you want to say too
because you're on the team
now how many people do you think in
congress understand what i just told you
think about it
how many members of congress
are
with it enough
that they would even understand what i
just told you
well you could practically name them
right rand paul would understand
right
tom cotton would understand
of course but you could name you know
the ones that are obvious
but
do you think that most of them
understand
i don't think so i don't think so i
don't think
i i think that
yeah thomas massey would understand
obviously
so there are definitely some super smart
members of congress there's no doubt
about that you know we can make fun of
them all day long but there are a number
of them who are super smart
super smart
and
i'm not sure they have enough power
compared to how much they should matt
gates would understand yeah now we're
i'm just you know mentioning some
people who are more right-leaning but
surely there are people on the left who
understand it but i don't know if they
care
because to them it might look like
things are being persuaded in their
direction which
which would be
yeah i would say anybody
anybody who has a legal background
and understands
and has seen the app
see most of congress has never seen tick
tock wouldn't you agree
how many members of congress have
actually held tick tock in their hand
and scrolled
i don't know how many
10
maybe but you wouldn't really understand
that unless you felt it
uh i recently got addicted to
uh
instagram reels
which is basically tick tock just the
instagram version and
you know i'm i'm sort of keyed into this
old persuasion thing and my god
do i feel the pull
the the actual pull of the
swipe one more time because it's learned
exactly what to feed me you want to hear
the weirdest one
here's the weirdest one
i have this sort of strange you know i
don't know if it's a
health related problem or what but my
hip
gets really tight in the morning
so tight that i can't use the stairs for
like a few hours like it's just so hard
to even walk upstairs and i'm perfectly
healthy by the afternoon i can you know
walk for miles and run up the stairs
but just this weird thing where my i
don't know it feels like my butt or my
hips
are so tight i can't just barely walk
upstairs
now had you ever heard of that problem
before in your whole life i never have
i've never heard of anybody who had that
problem
never
never heard of a single person with that
problem
my social media is filled with
stretching exercises to fix that problem
i've never googled it
i've never i've never done a search
for anything related to that
i've only ever talked about it privately
in my home
and all of my social media is giving me
solutions
now here's the weird part
not only did it diagnose me
it cured me
the algorithm cured me
it listened to me talk about a problem
and it didn't just give me a commercial
you know that was selling me something
it actually gave me something that
wasn't a commercial
like their memes i don't know their
videos sort of commercially
but they weren't selling something
direct
they were just telling you how to
stretch
and i thought
what else can it do
how many other things will you be cured
of because your social media listened to
you
let me ask you this
oh here's another one
here's another one
uh
i wanted to see the trend of
i'm not going to say the word out loud
because social media won't want me to
use the word
but it's a word that starts with s
and involves
people ending their own existence on
this planet so i'm just won't use the
word because i don't want to get picked
up
so i wanted to do a search to see if
people who had
a legal
you know doctor-assisted
situation
to see if that had grown or or decreased
in popularity so i was just looking for
a general knowledge thing
and
my my phone wouldn't let me search for
it
it wouldn't let me search for it
it would only let me talk to a
professional
let me say it again it wouldn't let me
search for anything on the topic
except to talk to a professional
because i think the algorithm assumed
that if i'm looking for that i might be
looking for how to do it
and that wasn't a bad guess i wasn't
but it was not a bad guess
a lot of people are going to search for
looking how to do it
and it comes up with a message instead
do you need to talk to somebody you know
here's something you can talk to
now
yeah that's actually good i i have very
mixed opinions about this very mixed
opinions on one hand it thwarted me from
just looking up some interesting
information i didn't like that i figured
out how to do it just by typing instead
of speaking it
but when i spoke it it just wouldn't let
me get past that
that look and talk to a professional now
i think that was you know
maybe a little heavy-handed you could
argue that one but given how much
[Music]
given that the intention of it is so
obviously
right-minded
i'm a little forgiving about the
the friction there
so i don't know maybe that's the future
where the the algorithm will
find a problem you didn't even know you
had and then suggest a solution
um california has come up with a
heatwave ranking system
so they don't have the details yet
they're going to work on it but the idea
is that the heat wave if you have to
you know turn off somebody's electricity
they'll have some structured way to do
it i assume this means that the
hospitals keep their power
maybe some residences don't
and i was trying to imagine where i
might show up on the heatwave ranking
system
and like well you know i'm not in the
hospital and
i'm not uh
i'm not in a senior home
uh
not a school maybe the schools need at
first maybe medical facilities in
general
um i'm thinking that by the time you get
down to me
i'm kind of in the kill box i think i'm
in the kill box
i think there's going to be a list that
says well if it gets really hot
it's okay to kill scott
but save the other people i think you
know we can let scott go
i just feel like i'm going to be on the
list toward the bottom i don't know
it's just me
well wall street journal is reporting
what many of you
already knew
and by the way if you live in a place
that as lots of immigrants from below
the border
you already knew this
the hispanics coming over the border
they're not liberal
they're not liberal
they're religious
they care about work
inflation paychecks
that stuff education
so it turns out that uh the move toward
the hispanic population becoming more
and more republican
apparently is quite pronounced
so at this point it's a thing
correct me if i'm wrong
how many of you have been watching long
enough
that you remember me saying this was
going to be a thing
because i can see it forming because i'm
a little closer to that community you
know i just interact with them all the
time
i can see it clearly
you can see it clear as day
there's no such thing
as a woke mexican
i'm exaggerating of course
of course i'm exaggerating but i've
never met one and when i say mexican i
mean somebody born there now they may be
americanized and they may be they may
even be citizens or whatever but i've
never met a walk mexican
never
i'm not sure i ever will
right
so if they're not natural republicans i
don't know who is
they're so natural republicans they even
get past the fact that they think
republicans might be a little biased
against them
that's how much republican they are
they're even willing to say you know
republicans might not like me but i sure
like low taxes and
having a job and stuff
i like that stuff i like education
so
i think there's going to be more of that
i think that one of the funniest
political mistakes and i think it's a
mistake is the democrats are apparently
funding the extreme
mega
republican candidates in the primaries
under the clever theory
that if their if their democrat
candidate runs in the general election
against the most extreme person
that they've got a real advantage
because nobody wants the extreme person
so much so that they're massively
funding
the most extreme republican candidates
so it's
democrats who are funding their
opponents
to make sure they get the worst opponent
so they have an advantage
what do you think of that idea
pretty good idea or a pretty bad idea
yeah
let me tell you the
uh five-lane persuasion highway that
they opened that maybe they haven't
noticed yet
and it goes like this
let's say i'm one of those extreme
republicans who just won the primary
here's what i would say
[Music]
i got more donations from democrats than
republicans
and we're done here
i got the most done or or
this is better not don't say you got
more say i got more i got more donations
from democrat sources than any candidate
who's run in this state before
and you're done
because it's true
it's true
fact check it
now suppose you fact check it
and then the and then the uh
the voters get wise and the voters catch
on to the nuance they're wait a minute
the voters say
you said that they funded you but now
that i know the details really this was
a special case they're really funding
you to win the primary to be better
voters don't understand that
the ones who do understand that
have already made up their mind
if you follow politics enough do you
understand the democrats were trying to
 with the republicans if you
understand that you've already made up
your mind who you're going to vote for
if you're anywhere in the hardly paying
attention i could go either way
candidates the only thing you're going
to understand is that the democrats
also supported this republican
that
that's what you'll come away with
because remember people are only getting
10 of every topic
the 10 of that topic they'll understand
is that both sides donated to this guy
i know it looks like the one of the
biggest political mistakes
of all time and somewhat obvious one
but
if they pull it off
i will i will tell you i was wrong
i will tell you i was wrong if they get
away with it but i think it's going to
backfire
so i'm going to bet that the ones who
got massive democrat fundings under this
condition
under the following condition
that those candidates recognize that
saying that they got the most funding
from both sides that anybody ever got
is
is the way to play it they'd have to
play it right
right they have to play it right not
just ignore it but if they play it right
i think they're golden
uh mike cernovich being mike cernovich
uh
more than anybody has ever been mike
cernovich
i i swear to god one of the things i
love about that guy more than anything
is that he's not like anybody else
and he's like aggressively not like
anybody else
so it's always interesting
and he tweeted today the fbi has to be
closed down
it's beyond reform state and local law
enforcement can prosecute the real
client real crimes and parenthetically
he says pedophiles like larry nasser and
epstein
disband the stasi
and when i first read that i thought oh
that's too far
that's too far
but then i realized
you know
if you're certain
you understand how things work
and there's no such thing as too far
there's just an opening offer right
so opening offer get rid of them
completely
and i agree completely
i'm totally on board
opening offer is get rid of them
completely
now it seems like that would be a giant
problem because it would leave you know
big gap and
things that are covered and we would
want those gaps covered i don't think
local law enforcement could necessarily
fill in so i don't think this is a
practical idea
but as an opening offer
yep
i'm on board
i have no idea how this could be made to
work but on the other hand the current
situation is uh
untenable
you don't really have a choice of
continuing the way we are so the opening
offer
completely get rid of them i'm totally
on board with that
um here's a uh
sort of an analogy i guess
when i was in i worked in banking
i'm not sure if this is still true
but
if you were a banker you were required
to take and i can't remember
i think there were some
that every employee has to take four
consecutive days off in a calendar year
and you say why is that i mean i get
that they have to take vacations but
what's important about
four consecutive days
it turns out that there are some ways
that employees could steal money from
banks
that required being there every day to
re-falsify the records so you had to
continually re-falsify to move forward
your fraud
and so they would make every employee
take four days off because they couldn't
move forward their fraud while they were
gone
and that's how they catch them and they
caught a lot of people that way it was
actually worked
and i think about that
with the fbi like somehow that reminds
me of it because it is pretty radical to
say that you can't even come to work for
four days because
not only do we suspect that you might
try something
but we know you will
so
bankers have a very let's say
a realistic belief about people they
have to
if you're a banker you're very realistic
about people
otherwise you lose all your money
and one of the things that bankers know
is it doesn't matter how honest you were
when you were hired
you get that
it doesn't matter how honest you were
when you were hired
if you see an opportunity to steal money
and not get caught
it's gonna happen it's gonna happen
maybe not you right maybe not you
but there will be enough people cycling
through that opportunity
somebody's gonna take it
so bankers know that if you leave
anything stealable it'll get stolen
that's
probably the most basic
banking theory
if it can be stolen somebody's going to
steal it
so that's what the bank does keeps it
from getting stolen
and it seems to me that the fbi
much
like mike cernovich's point
might be beyond the point
where tweaks would make a difference
because the people doing the tweaking
would be the people we didn't trust
so you might have to completely
dismantle it
and then rebuild it
i mean maybe you keep the rented space
and stuff i don't know
but you might have to do something
closer to destroying and rebuilding it
from scratch i don't know what that
looks like
but it's a conversation
as people who don't have any good ideas
like to say
it's a conversation the country has to
have
you know so the the least useful thing a
a pundit can say you know that's the
conversation the country needs to have i
just did it because i don't have any
idea how to fix anything either
um
here's a
feeling that i've got
you know we've got a
zillion different topics and there are
reasons to vote for one candidate versus
another and you could talk forever about
all the different ins and outs of
advantages and disadvantages
but
every now and then there's something
that pops out as a single issue
where i would just say okay i don't care
about anything else i'm just going to
vote on that single issue
probably a lot of democrats will vote
and maybe republicans do on the issue of
abortion
now if that was your single issue
i would respect that
it's not mine
it's not my single issue but if it was
yours if it were yours
i'd respect that that that would be
important enough to be a single issue
voter on
immigration same thing
if you said i don't care about anything
except stopping immigration
or i don't care about anything except
stopping inflation those would be good
pretty good single issue
topics i'm going to give you my single
issue topic
what's up with raps
that's that that's my whole topic
that's a reason to vote republican
because if you vote a republican there's
some chance we might find out what's up
with ray epps so if you don't know raps
was the
person who is on video encouraging
people to enter the capitol on january
6th
but he was not arrested i don't believe
his phone was taken but we don't know
that for sure i don't think we know that
but there's no evidence he was he was
given the same treatment as let's say
mike lindell
who the fbi surrounded and took his
phone from him his phone from which he
runs his entire company
most important tool he asks they just
took it from
and
thomas massey uh tweeted this he said
when merrick garland testified in front
of the house judiciary committee i
showed him this video he then refused to
answer the video was about rayapps i
believe
he then refused to answer my question of
how many agents or assets of the federal
government were present on january 5th
and 6th
and i sort of forgotten that the
government had confirmed that they were
part of that
and when i say confirmed by refusing to
say they weren't
to me i accept that as a confirmation
now we don't know how much
if it was you know just a little i'd say
okay that didn't matter
if it were a lot
then i would say that's the whole story
and so
i
uh independent
of whether it matters that ray epps was
or was not part of the fbi independent
of whether that matters and independent
of what he did the fact that your
government won't tell you
this is the central question of the
republic
and let me let me say this if it turns
out that reyes was nothing but
a patriot who is trying to make his
beliefs known
which is entirely possible
does anybody rule out that it's possible
he's just a patriot
it's possible
isn't it
it's possible
i know you think probably not
i'm not going to argue it probably but
it's possible
right it's possible
so
uh i would i would say that if he's
legit and if and a related question
if he was legit as in not a fed
and the feds ever give us an honest
answer about their involvement
then i would say you know
it looks like
trump might not be the best solution for
the country
because he was involved in this and even
if you want to excuse his behavior
he's just part of this big ugly thing
there would be a blight on the republic
and you know maybe we should just move
on and get you know clear clear the
slate just start with a clean plate
i could see that
but
if it turns out that we are not being
told what rayapps was up to or the any
other federal assets if they were there
if we're not going to be told that
then
that's my one issue
then i then i could support trump
even if everything about him that you
say is true is true
even if he had like secrets he shouldn't
have had in mar-a-lago
you know even if he
is uh guilty of some i don't know minor
financial
uh campaign thing i don't know
i wouldn't care about any of it
because if your republic won't tell you
if they're the ones who did the treason
because that would have been
if the fbi was that involved you know as
much as the people on the right like to
think if they were
then that was treason
wasn't it
i mean it was a form of treason
if they weren't
then it yeah it looks more like the
argument that
the badness was all in the right
but we need to know that
we we don't need to just
pass that
that that's a that's a do not pass ray
epps
you don't get to go anywhere else
so that would be that would be my
stopping point my single point i need to
know an answer to that question i need
to know the answer to thomas massey's
question
and if i don't get an answer i'm all
republican
i'm not a republican but i'll resp i'll
support whoever the republican candidate
is i don't care who it is
but they've got to promise that they're
going to get to the bottom of this
if the republican candidate says hey we
have to leave it in the past and i'm
like okay that's different so basically
neither of you have a good an idea but
this is it
i want to know if he's just a patriot
because if he is then maybe i'll
disbelieve a lot of the things that the
republicans say
or a lot more
will i actually vote yeah probably not
but
but i would definitely make noise
and uh i think that would be a
legitimate single
single topic vote
you have to tell us this is the minimum
we need to know
is do we have a republic still
am i wrong
the minimum you need to know as a
citizen does the public does the
republic still exist because remember
they did show their hand with that 50
current and prior intel people who said
the laptop was fake
once we saw that and now we know for
sure that that was an op that was our
intelligence people running an op on the
public
that was real
that's confirmed we know that to be true
we don't have to guess
given that that was true
we don't know if we have a republic
and i would say that the answer to this
whole ray apps plus any other fbi assets
that were not there
the answer to that question
tells you if you have a republic
am i wrong
well let's not don't make us think past
the sale
do we still have a republic or have our
has the deep state
completely taken over
have they completely taken over
and i would think that this would be an
interesting appeal to independent voters
because i would if i were a republican
especially i'd say here's the deal
all of you independent voters
i know you can go either way that's what
makes you independent voters in reality
they they usually go the way they always
lean
but there might be a few
you say look i'm going to find out what
happened with the fbi and ray epps if
i'm president
whatever it is
whatever the answer is we're going to
live with that but we're going to find
out
you independence is the only way you're
going to find out
if we still have a republic
i will tell you if you still have a
republic but you got to get me into the
presidency to do that
because i kind of am very curious
and here's the persuasion angle on this
curiosity is the most underrated
persuasion
um
energy
have you ever done something stupid
because you're curious
oh yeah you have
yeah you have if you're human
yeah
have you ever been obsessed
by something because you didn't know the
answer and you just had to know because
you're so curious
of course
we're we're born we're born to be
obsessed by those things that are not
answered and yet important
you know you're designed that way
so
um
i've never i can't think of any
politician who's ever taken advantage of
that but authors do all the time
if you read a harry potter novel
at the end of each chapter there's like
a little mystery like where did that
sound come from and why is that
happening
um
i'm going to get back to your question
carpe
so
anyway i think that if the republican
candidate says look we've got this
mystery we don't know if we still have a
republic but i'll get to the bottom of
it i'll answer the question for you
that would be really really motivating
to me
because curiosity is a real driving
force
um so carpe dunked him just uh asked a
question if i used my persuasion
abilities
uh for two years and really worked on
reducing the homeless problem in
california could i do it the answer is
no i couldn't even come close
now that that would be completely
impossible
because i ca i can't talk to the
homeless
and if i did they would say uh we choose
to be here
because we like drugs and if you put us
indoors anywhere they're not going to
let us do drugs
so all things being cool i'd rather be
drugged than on the street thank you
very much
so no there's nothing i can persuade
because you can't persuade people to do
something that's bad for them and they
know it
the street people know what they prefer
if you think that they're wrong
so what
you think i'm wrong too
do you get a vote
how many of you think i shouldn't have a
third cup of coffee today somebody
there's somebody who thinks i shouldn't
have a third cup of coffee today
do you get a vote no you don't get a
vote
only i get a vote
the street people don't care what you
think
they only care what they think
and in their opinion
as
living human beings on the planet earth
and mostly citizens of america
they've looked at their options and they
say you know i like being on drugs and
being outdoors
compared to
being off drugs and being indoors
they get to do that that's their choice
so no you can't persuade people to do
something that is against their interest
as they see it you know you could you
could argue that
they should see it differently but you
can't persuade people against their own
self-interest
not not really
i mean that's that's the hardest
persuasion so no i don't think i could
make a dent in that i could work around
the edges
i could work around the edges
but i couldn't i couldn't just clear the
streets there's nobody who could do that
with the persuasion
that actually has to be force
if you're going to do it it would be
with government force you know we're
going to put you in this home for 30
days after that you're on your own but
we're going to at least try to fix you
something like that you could argue
about the you know the ethics of that
all right
question
if you were a january 6th defendant
why can't you call rayapps
what am i missing
is there a lawyer here who can answer
that question
if i'm a january 6 defendant i'm still
in jail
i'm mounting my defense
you tell me i can't call rayapps
put him on the stand
find out if he's the fed
that's that's not relevant to my defense
because here's the argument
the entire argument is about incitement
to riot
it's not about the riot it was also
about the riot
but
it's the incitement
the whole question is did trump incite a
riot
don't you don't you need to know all the
sources of incitement if the question is
did somebody incite it
well you've got to put on the table all
the potential people who could have been
inciting it and see which one was doing
the inciting
so if it's illegal for a president to
incite a riot
well certainly it's illegal for the fbi
to do it
wouldn't you say
now
suppose the courts say you can't put
reyes on the stand because
there's no evidence that he's part of
the fbi
to which i say i don't get to
find out for myself what's true
i don't get to ask him in public
i would put garland on the stand
if i were a january 6 defendant i would
put the attorney general on the stand
i'd put them all instead i put the
government on the stand because in my
opinion
incitement is incitement and i'd make
sure that everybody saw all the
incitement from all the sources i would
put
the ex-head
zucker
of cnn on the stand
and i would say
do you think you incited anybody
yeah or ray yeah
i bet i'd basically put the whole
 government on the stand
now i don't know if the judge would
allow any of that
but if they didn't at least allow the
fbi or ray apps or somebody
i don't see how you could have a trial
i mean i feel like that has to go to the
supreme court if you don't get that
all
right you do nothing in dc you said rod
good luck yeah i suppose if you're in dc
it's a tougher cell
um
so
you know this inflation reduction act
and my first opinion of it was well
there's some stuff in there i probably
don't like
but at least it was a full-throated
financial endorsement of nuclear energy
and i said to myself well you know
nothing's perfect
but that's so important
that the the bill
produced you know major funding to
encourage uh the nuclear energy business
i thought well that's
you know that's so important
that maybe i can live with this other
stuff that i don't like
and then i saw
an alex epstein
tweet thread the 12 myths about the
terrible inflation reduction act
and it turns out that it's not going to
help nuclear energy at all
it's a trick
the trick is this
it doesn't matter how much money you
throw at nuclear
they can't get anything approved
nothing's ever been approved by the
entities that approved nuclear
power plants today
let me say that again the entity that
exists today to approve nuclear power
plants
has never approved one to completion
zero
zero
so we have a system that allows zero
things to get through it
but if they did
well how about that funding
so do you know what the nuclear funding
was about
it was a trick
to get more funding for green
because the money is in one pot i think
not positive i think the money's in one
pot
and if the nuclear project had a great
idea and they had approval well they
could get some of it
but they can't because they'll never get
approval
and then the
battery or the
sun or the wind people say i got a good
idea here's my project
it's all approved
and they get the money
so it looks like it's just a
trick
now
i don't know how worse could this be
how worse could it be and by the way
did i mention it was a tweet thread
about
12 myths
i'm not even going to read you the other
11.
but go to you know go to alex you should
you should follow him anyway
just follow him and you'll you'll see
all the good arguments on energy
so alex epstein just google him or just
search him on twitter and follow him
you'll see the other 11
but
oh my god
oh my god
now i'd like to think that the biden
government is also working on that
approval problem
so if they worked on the funding and
they got that first
but then separately they're trying to
remove the red tape
that'd be okay
but i'd like to hear that
and i'm not aware of any effort to do
that are you i feel like we would have
heard about it if anybody was doing
anything like that so i don't think it's
happening
but
maybe a republican would
don't you think that a republican would
be more likely to work on the
streamlining of nuclear energy plants i
think so
so there's another single
single topic reason to vote
so you know how we were all puzzled by
uh
lindsey graham and pushing for this
national abortion law so close to the
midterms it seems like a political error
but then on cnn chris saliza had a
opinion
that maybe it was a strategy
and the strategy goes like this
if the republicans say nothing about
abortion and just try to minimize it
the republicans just own that argument
at least for their base they just own
that argument so rather than letting
them just own the argument
the
hypothesis is that what graham was
really trying to do is give
republicans something to argue
positively for
in other words uh
his
his uh proposition
i guess it's uh
no abortions after 15 weeks or something
like that
and i guess that would make it
compatible with much of the rest of the
world
and it's a less extreme position than it
could be it's less extreme
so what it would do is give some cover
to republicans so they could say well
you know i like this less extreme thing
that's most of the world agrees with
it's not the crazy it's not extreme
it's anything but extreme it's similar
to europe
so i think he's trying to give them an
argument here's why i think
it won't work
because voters only absorb 10 of the
nuance
and all they see is abortion yes or
abortion no do you how many how many
democrats
are going to say well you know he's sort
of a
against abortion but he's being
reasonable like the european nobody's
gonna do that
nobody's gonna do that
nobody to me it looks like a bad
strategy
because it ignores the fact that people
don't do nuance
if people did nuance
maybe but they don't
all right
uh over in ukraine uh zielinski was in a
car crash
that was at least bad enough to get him
some medical attention but he had no
serious injuries
um
but what do you think about the fact
that the leader of this country at war
was vulnerable to a car accident
like how does he travel is it just like
him in two cars
well how do you even have a car accident
he's not part of a motorcade or anything
or was he like the first one in the
motorcade
well i don't even know how that happens
and i don't know how the person driving
the car didn't get shot but
i think i don't know
so putin is using his big missiles to
take out ukrainian infrastructure and he
took on a dam
and flooded i guess lenski's old
hometown so a lot of this is getting
personal that sounded personal
but what do you make of the fact that
russia seems to be mounting nothing like
a defense on the ground
but they're using their expensive
weapons just to with ukraine
and none of the stuff they're doing now
looks like it could help them win
i don't believe that taking out that dam
helps russia win militarily does it
that looks like just collective
punishment
am i wrong
it looked like collective punishment
it looked like an attack on the
civilians
now let me ask you this
is there any scenario in which
russian citizens could occupy ukraine
now
there's no way
now
there isn't any way that you that
russian citizens
could be like resident in ukraine and
sort of managing things in control they
would all be murdered
there's just no way
because russia you know putin's gone too
far
right for a while there was a way
if if russia had like immediately taken
over a kiev and
got rid of zelinski and immediately
started a propaganda campaign to you
know propagandize people and say hey we
saved you from the nazis that nobody's
seen
um i guess there are nazis there but
it could have worked
because he has so much control over what
people you know see
but at this point there's no there are
no ukrainians who don't know that putin
is killing civilians in ukraine
no matter what anger
not even a military
purpose
right
so
i it's over
i think the war is over in the sense
that you can now
know that russia won't win it
in the sense that they're not gonna
russia will never
at least in our lifetime won't take over
the whole of ukraine
that that opportunity is completely gone
now
the question remains about those
contested areas where they're still
fighting
but i'm not hearing that the russians
are putting up a real fight
it looks like their ukrainians are just
rolling them up
now maybe they essentialize their forces
in in the most critical place so there's
a big battle to come
but at the moment the ukrainians are
just rolling them up
scott you know zelinski killed his own
civilians when did he do that
when did he kill his own siblings or you
mean before the war right
because it was there was military action
in the disputed zones
there's a difference between
um
targeting military targeting civilians
and having them
die in the fighting it's a pretty big
difference
all right when he sheldon esque
yeah
well you know i'm open to uh
i'm definitely open to hearing that
counter argument
and that would matter
that would matter i'm not a pro zelinski
guy by the way
did you know that
zelinski
there there's a
weasel vibe that i get from him
that is i can't turn it off
so i'm not pro zielenski i will simply
note when he does something that's
effective for his country
i'm definitely not pro zelinski there's
something
that bothers me a lot about that guy and
i know exactly what it is
so the biden administration
hired a racist for the job of uh
what's his job called
uh diversity chief
at the department of defense's education
wing
so the diversity chief
apparently is an overt racist
and when i say overt
allow me to read some of the tweets
these were on the twitter feed
somebody's calling me anti-semitic
what the hell is that about
anti-semitic
oh because it's a lenski
oh because zelinski gives me a weasel
vibe is that why
because if you hadn't mentioned that he
was jewish i'd forgotten entirely about
that
all right so i'm oh you're joking okay
if you're joking i'll accept it
all right uh
so here's the the woman who was uh hired
for this diversity uh chief job
she was complaining about some
some meeting she was in where the white
people were bothering her and she said
in a tweet quote
this lady actually had the audacity
the co-audacity
that's caucasian audacity
the co-audacity
this lady actually had the audacity to
say that black people can be racist too
i had to stop the session and give karen
the business
karen
a name that is only used for
white women
uh
she said we are not the majority we
don't have the power she continued
um
blah blah blah
on another occasion wing responded to a
user who said uh i'm exhausted by 99 of
the white men in education
and 90 percent of 95 percent of the
white women
where can i get a break from white
nonsense for a while
and wing responded to that tweet with if
another karen tells me about her
feelings i might lose it
so
i guess she took down her twitter
account
now
apparently we're not supposed to say
that's racist
because she's black
that's just racist
there's there's that's not anything else
right that there's just a racist person
who is tweeting racist things in public
and got in charge and was put in charge
of uh
thwarting racism
yeah
all right
um
it's very convenient that black people
can't be racist isn't it how convenient
only you can if you're not black
all right um
some more newspapers are uh canceling me
i'm getting more and more news of being
canceled
uh there's something that i forgot about
when i told you how newspapers are
really good about not canceling people
remember i told you that
and i said
well you know newspapers are the one
place where you can have freedom of
speech still
because the the professional news people
always had been uh
just wildly free speech
as they should be but here's what i
forgot do you know who know who owns
most newspapers
billionaires
hedge funds
the people who own newspapers also own
businesses
for which esg would be
you know important
so
i didn't realize that i was directly
attacking the owners of the newspapers
so
not such a big surprise that i'm getting
canceled
who would be calling me
at this time of day
hello
what not talking
i guess not
i get a lot of phone calls from people
who don't say anything when i answer
uh
o vivek uh ramsay's new font is that an
anti-esg fund
uh not an unexpected outcome
so
um today
a lot of newspapers are cancelling uh
well i don't know how many but a lot of
newspapers are not running gilbert this
week because of the topic
but some of them will cancel
so
if you're wondering
and by the way i don't
i don't have any way to monetize esg
i suppose if more people read dilbert i
suppose indirectly
but i'm just losing money
right
by by advocating on this topic
at your request
it just cost me money you know that
right
and i say that because
if i were making money from it you
shouldn't trust me
or anybody else if somebody's making
money from something don't trust
anything they say
that's just a general rule
yeah now this
this is one where
sort of the spider-man problem i told
you
given that dilbert is uniquely situated
to make a statement about esg i felt
like i had to
but it wasn't good for me
and now i'd like to make this ray apps
thing a thing
and again it's not so much about rayap's
larger question that thomas massey asked
you know can you tell us what was your
involvement if they can't tell us you
have to let all of the
january 6 people go and by the way
that's the way that
trump could play it how about this
trump could say
if we don't have transparency about the
fbi's involvement i'm going to pardon
everybody
how about that
because if you say if we don't have
transparency from the fbi
then even the left has a real trouble
complaining
if you say i'm just going to pardon them
because i think justice was not done
then it looks like you're pardoning
criminals
to the left
but if you say this doesn't have
anything to do with their crimes or
alleged crimes
the pardon has nothing to do with their
alleged crimes
it has to do with the fact that if the
government won't be transparent then we
can't we can't assume that justice was
done
and if you have a situation where
justice can't be done
i'm gonna deal with it
i'm gonna deal with it
so i wouldn't i wouldn't be involved if
justice could handle it but justice
can't be done because the fbi won't
won't won't be transparent
and if our justice system can't handle
it i'm not going to let them
put people in jail
the justice system has a whole
that hole is it doesn't know what's
happening with the fbi because the fbi
is not talking
as long as that hole's there
nobody goes to jail for those those
crimes even if they did bad things even
if they did bad things
um
yes i believe ted cruz asked
the same question
and also got stonewalled by the fbi
that's correct
the last item in your laundry list lost
me what was that
right um
i got a uh copy of uh
jared kushner's new book
um
i'm gonna look through that and
give you some give you some opinion on
that
you know that that's actually the book
i'm most interested in a lot of these uh
alleged behind the scenes
white house books
you always wonder how much access do
they really have
right
but
jared kushner he actually
knows exactly what was happening
everywhere
he's probably the only one
that he probably knows more than the
president knows
about you know the the machinery of what
was happening at the time because the
president kind of floats above it
but he probably knows more than anybody
knows about that period of time so i
have the most interest in seeing what he
said
watch his interview with dave rubin
oh i will
have you seen navarro's comments on
kushner
i don't remember seeing him
uh what about stephen miller
well he definitely
stephen miller was in the mix but i
don't know
but
but i think he was in fewer topics
at the guerrilla channel
oh yeah i didn't talk about the
immigrant buses going to martha's
vineyard
let me let me say that from a persuasion
standpoint
the republican governors shipping those
those people to the high end places
it's really good
it's really good persuasion
but it's funny because there are so few
of them
you know the total number of people are
boss is just like nothing and they're
still getting upset about
they're getting upset about having to
share one percent of the pain
in fact that's that's the way i would
express it if i were a republican
i'd say they're mad because we made them
share one percent of the pain
it's probably less than one percent
but if you're not willing to share one
percent of the pain
then you know what's really happening
here all right we can be honest
once we've squeezed them to to scream
then you can finally get some
transparency about what's going on
everybody's in favor of somebody else
paying the price
everybody's happy with the bill if
somebody else pays it
but as soon as they have to pay one
percent of the bill like screaming like
ah
no don't give me one percent of the bill
yeah and the martha's vineyard thing was
just sort of perfect persuasion
now
let me ask you this
do you think somebody's advising these
governors
or did or did the idea just sort of
bubble up and
you know maybe maybe more than one
person had the idea
or do you think that there's a master
persuader somewhere
in the mix advising these
southern governors
what do you think
it be trump yeah maybe
here's what i think
this play is smarter than governor
that's what i think
as smart as desantis is as smart as
abbott is taking nothing away from their
intelligence
this is this is a grade point higher
it looks like something they got
convinced to do and would be happy they
did it because it's working
i feel like
i feel like there's a
very clever advisor somewhere in the mix
a very clever advisor
i guess we'll never know who
no i'm not i'm not uh cleverly telling
you it's me i had nothing to do with it
yeah it wasn't my idea at all i had
zero i had nothing to do with
i appreciate it though i appreciate that
it was a good play
but it wasn't mine
cernovich has special counsel well i
think
you know as much as i love cernovich
um i think you need
you know a working lawyer who does that
stuff
right
uh
you don't need somebody who just has
that background you know the education
you need somebody who does that stuff
what about pompeo
all right
um
i believe we're done here
have we covered everything that's worth
covering with the best live stream
that ever there was
yeah the train strike looks like they
worked that out
um
yeah
well
let me give you
yeah i better not
change my mind
all right yeah so this was 10 out of 10.

ever seen

your whole life
