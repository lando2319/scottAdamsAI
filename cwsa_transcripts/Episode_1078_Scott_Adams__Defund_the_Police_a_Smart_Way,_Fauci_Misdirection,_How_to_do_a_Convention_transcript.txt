well i was asked the other day
why do i always do this three times
and it's because i do this first on live
stream
a lot of people will see it in replay
but those of you on live stream
will feel a sense of it's almost like on
your computer when you're
you're watching a progress you know the
little progress monitor
don't you feel better when you can see
progress
that your computer program is working
well that's what this is
i do this the same routine so that as
soon as you get on
you say to yourself oh i got in about
the paper shuffling time or
he's taking a simultaneous sip
speaking of which i've got a special
guest in a moment
but first first it's a simultaneous sip
and it's the thing you do before a great
day happens
and today is gonna be a great day
you don't know it yet and maybe not for
everybody
but it's going to be a great day and
all you need to get this day going is a
copper bugger glass attacker chalice or
steiner canteen sugar flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes
everything better traffic pandemics
fleas you name it everything go
sublime now if technology serves me
we'll have a quick guest here
and it looks like this is going to work
so very excited
it's always fun when it works david
middleburn are you there
from othram now um those
those of you who have been watching my
periscopes you are familiar i think
you've heard of other
or t-h-r-a-m and can you explain what
other does for those who have it or just
the the quick summary of what the
company does
yeah what we do at author is we're a
forensics laboratory that
develops uh identities for people uh
that are either victims or perpetrators
of crimes and
we can analyze a crime scene sample look
at the dna figure out who is involved in
the crime
even if they're not in the uh you know
fbi codis
system or the traditional forensic
database so the basic idea is that the
regular police
have a database of people who have been
arrested or convicted generally you end
up in the coda system if you've been
convicted
and um you know it varies from state to
state sometimes you're convicted
but you still don't make it into the
database and sometimes there's ways to
get the database
um upon arrest so uh so the police the
police have this very small
limited database and if they get lucky
they get some dna at a crime scene
and by chance it's somebody who already
committed a crime
already was convicted and they had their
dna
and they got in the database and they
checked it
but with your company um you you have a
broader net
and describe just as quickly why you can
get more
dna samples than the police why do you
have access to more stuff
we use a different process the the
police as you noted though
the fbi system indexes you on a few
markers and then tracks
uh folks that commit uh repeat crime
what we're able to do is we're able to
get all the genomic information
from a crime scene sample and then use
that to do related testing and look even
for distant relatives
that might be connected and help us
figure out where the unknown person
might fit on a family tree
so you can imagine that even the
smallest scrap of information
can be useful in finding someone that is
even remotely connected to you
and any of those relationships can help
us essentially triangulate
or reverse engineer an identity or at
least a nearest relative
all right now now let me tie this into
the headlines to make this
relevant to all of you the big
conversation in the news is
defunding the police and that sounds
crazy right
who wants less police when you have just
as much crime
but i think that actually there there is
a smart way to do it
and the smart way to do it is to create
situations in which
getting away with a crime is effectively
impossible
so as you drive toward it's impossible
to get away with it
in theory the number of people who try a
crime that they know they'll get caught
for
should go down and therefore the number
of police you need should go down
so this is one of they're probably a
dozen technologies and private companies
that police do not have direct access to
everything from facial recognition to
you know drone things and and now dna
technologies
but there are a number of technologies
that could drive the ability to get away
with a crime
really close to zero and i don't i don't
think you'd have to get all the way to
big brother
so i see some comments saying that and
this is relevant because
in the news ivanka trump is spearheading
a
uh i guess an effort to try to solve a
bunch of cold cases
specifically for the native american
community and the alaskan alaska natives
because i guess it's an underserved
community and they have all this
these dna and cold cold case samples
that they can't solve so how many of
these
cold cases in the sense of if they have
some dna from the case
what percentage of all these cases that
ivanka is
targeting to get some resolution to
what percentage of those do you think
otherum could solve if you were brought
into this
i think that on the upfront side you
would you'd probably solve
you know somewhere close to 75 percent
and then it'll converge very closely at
over 90 percent
and that's that's in contrast to what
you would see with like a
typical system right now where sex
assault reveals identity through code is
15
of the time identified remains like one
percent of the time
all right now put yourself in the head
of a criminal
and you've got two possibilities the old
way
is that there was a 15 chance of getting
caught for let's say some violent crime
that would leave your dna
but what happens if it goes to 90 or 100
are you exactly as likely to do the
crime well if it's a crime of passion or
you're crazy or it's revenge or
something maybe yes
but i gotta think that if there were a
steady stream of reports
of cold cases being solved what does
that do to your mental
uh your mental understanding of risk
right so uh david would you imagine that
there will be lots of stories coming out
of the
the kind you're describing where a
really cold case that couldn't be solved
suddenly is easy to solve and what's
that going to do the the criminal mind
is something like that coming yeah i
mean there's been a steady flow of cases
that are that are being solved we've got
dozens that are that are going to be
announced in the next month or two
and i think uh i think what that does is
you know people have argued do we have
stricter punishment do we have uh you
know what what demotivates people to
commit crime and i think
i think severity of punishment hasn't
been very effective but i think knowing
that you're going to get caught
uh you know i think is a huge deterrent
and and at this point if you're going to
leave
uh whether on purpose or accident dna
somewhere there's there's
almost a certainty that you'll be caught
if not immediately very soon the
technology continues to develop
and so i think it's going to make people
think twice certainly it's going to
retire the idea of
i think i think the repeat crime serial
crimes
will probably converge on extinction
yeah
um well that's interesting serial crimes
will converge on extinction that that's
that's a phrase that you couldn't even
imagine before
but that sounds entirely practical to me
all right thank you i just wanted to get
a quick hit on that
and try to connect some things i've been
trying to connect but
just more generally i think that
defunding the police
if you change that into your mind into
how do you make
less crime happen in the first place
then you get to defunding the police
indirectly uh thank you david um david
middlemen
from other oth ram
thank you for coming all right
all right um you're gonna see more on
that in the coming months in the news i
think as cold cases get solved
uh raul davis on twitter
had a great idea i'll just put this out
there probably i don't know if it's
practical but you decide so rel davis
ceo branding expert
uh he's on twitter and he said any
convention that's smart
would make it a national event to rent
out drive-in theaters across the country
and project their candidate on the big
screen so think of this idea you do a
bunch of
pop-up drive-ins you don't ha you don't
have to use existing drive-ins there
aren't that many
but you could do a pop-up you know just
put up a screen or a
white project against a white wall or
something
and it would be pretty easy to live
stream and project
something that's really common and cheap
and easy to do
so you could have a drive-in theater
situation where you've got a virtual
convention
that happens all over the country at the
same time and imagine that you're
you're sitting there you're watching the
convention on tv
it's streamed there's no live audience
and you hear the heart
the horns honking you know wherever you
were you'd hear
like honking for applause or whatever
uh and it'd be fun it'd be really fun
wouldn't it
now i don't know if you can keep it safe
enough with bathrooms and whatever you
need to do
but i believe there are there are
drive-in theaters that are open
so i know they've figured out the the
bathroom and whatever else they have to
figure out
so that would be the the thing i like
about this idea
almost has nothing to do with politics
and i don't care who does it you know
democrats or republicans
it has more to do with the fact that
americans
just want to participate we just want to
get in the car
we just want to go somewhere we want to
be at an event
we want to see some other people we just
need to get out of the house
you know in some safe productive way so
this
that idea does both i love that um
there's a lot of conversation and i
haven't weighed into it much at all
about mail-in votes and the reason that
i haven't talked about it is i don't
quite understand it
meaning that there's something about the
argument
about why the um what are the two
categories there's the absentee ballots
which we've had forever and they seem to
work fine
but everybody voting by mail is more of
a problem
and i think that has to do with the fact
that uh if everybody just gets a ballot
whether they want it or not
a lot of people will it'll be bailed to
the wrong place
it'll be mailed to a dead person
somebody else will pick up the mail and
fill it out for you
you know so you can imagine a whole
bunch of problems like that
and i gotta say it's a tough one
because i i certainly understand why
states want to do it and i completely
understand how open to fraud it would be
but here's the question i have is there
any way to test that ahead of time
and i couldn't think of one but but i
you can smell it before you can see it
sometimes i feel as if there's somebody
who would be smart enough
to say well why don't we just test a
thousand
sample votes but i just don't know that
you could design the test
so it'd be good enough but i hope
somebody is smart enough
because we have enough time so if you
could do
let me describe the the bad version of
it so when you hear this
idea and you say to yourself well scott
there's an obvious flaw in your idea
i know that i know that this is the bad
version i'm just trying to inspire
somebody else
to say well i can fix that problem and
maybe i can make this into something
so the bad version would be this do you
do a test of a thousand citizens i don't
know are they random
or do you have to tell them during the
test i'm not sure which makes sense
and you just see if the process can flow
from actually receiving it to filling it
out
to mailing it but i guess you'd have the
problem that nobody would be trying to
cheat
so if it's a test there's nobody trying
to thwart the test
so it may be impossible but i would put
that out there to people who are
smarter than i am about
anything to see if there is a way to
test that i just wonder now i saw the
there was a news report of a local
a local correspondent i think he did a
local test of mailing some ballots and
and and he discovered that there were
some problems in the post office
i think three out of 100 ballots
didn't make the whole process which is
way too many
imagi imagine an election in which you
were pretty sure
three percent of the votes got lost and
that wouldn't be much of an election
if you know given how close our
elections are
so uh i would say my opinion on all of
this
is i'm just as concerned as other people
but i think we have the weirdest
situation in the world here in which
i don't know that we have an opportunity
to have a credible
vote this time because there's so much
going on
and so many accusations on both sides of
irregularities and
voter suppression and mail-in votes and
every other thing that i don't even know
if we have the option of a fair
election it just might not even be an
option
so what do you do if you can't have a
fair
election for president what do you do so
here's what i think we would do in a
normal year
it doesn't make that much difference who
is president right
yeah if you looked in the past that was
the thing that um
pundit said all the time well it doesn't
matter who you elect they just raise
your taxes anyway
well democrat republican doesn't matter
you still end up in a war
but i don't know that that's true in
2020. the difference between biden and
trump
that might be the biggest difference
we've ever seen
you know the difference between hillary
clinton and trump
you could argue was well that's a pretty
big difference but it's not
gigantic right the country would still
look like the united states
if hillary clinton had been elected you
might not like
elements of it but still the united
states
if biden gets elected you know he would
be the
most progressive candidate and i'm not
going to
have an opinion on whether that's good
or bad i'm just saying it's the most
different from what trump offers
so this time the result really could
change the fate of the country in my
opinion
given that it's such a big difference
trump is probably the safest
in terms of risk management simply
because you know what the last four
years look like
and even if you didn't like those last
four years
you'd have to admit that if you
subtracted the pandemic
it looked pretty good looked pretty good
we didn't start any
start any big wars we ended some wars we
wound down that the economy was good
so if you were even a little bit
objective
and you said to yourself you know i
don't know what's going on here biden
could be a big problem and we wouldn't
even know who got elected really
and then the progressive stuff is
sufficiently
big enough changes you know i'm not
going to say radical because that's
just politicizing the speech it's a big
enough
change that any big change introduces a
new set of risks
so there is a different risk profile and
i would argue that the biden risk
is far bigger because it's an unknown
and also a big change trump is closer to
a known
if he gets reelected you're gonna see
some tweets you don't like
they're gonna be some fact checking that
doesn't look good
there you know he there will be uh world
leaders
who say some bad things about trump you
just guaranteed what that
looks like 90 right always some
surprises but you kind of know what a
trump president's
gonna look like so if you have this much
uncertainty about the result
you have basically one way
to get a safe outcome that
doesn't drive the country apart and it's
a landslide election for trump
now that might happen anyway but
the republic is going to be a little bit
at risk
if we go the other way it's impossible
to know exactly risk but i would say
that
doing you know the what's the saying the
uh
the evil that you know is better than
the evil you don't know
so even if you don't like trump as
president you got to know what you're
getting that's my point
apparently trump said on air force one
that he's planning to ban
tick-tock in the united states
how about that so tick tock as you know
is the app
that is owned by a chinese company and
therefore
the assumption is and it's been
determined that the code
actually does this it's collecting a lot
of information
on americans and kids in particular and
so
that will be banned the uh the
decoupling
of the united states from china i think
is just
it's a thing now meaning that you don't
have to wonder if it's happening
and i don't think it was this was hard
to imagine a year ago wasn't it
imagine a year ago that we would be
sitting here saying that we are actively
decoupling our economy from china
it was hard to imagine i was asking for
it a year ago
and i was pretty pretty early on the
banned tick tock
train so things are going the way that i
want them to go
um have you ever noticed that almost
everything in the united states goes the
way i want it to go in the long run
it's the weirdest coincidence it's
something i noticed
in my 20s so when i was in my twenties
uh i wasn't talking publicly about
politics or big
big events but i would have preferences
and then i would watch and i'd say oh
that's interesting
the very thing i was hoping would happen
it happened
uh it happened so often that it's sort
of freaky
i mean seriously a year ago i was
lobbying as hard as you possibly could
to decouple from china
and you know and and then the banning
the tick tock but even i didn't think it
was necessarily going to happen
right it felt a it felt like quite a
reach
here we are um what about opening
schools
i continue to say that education
is a national security uh matter
especially if you're doing it wrong if
you're doing it wrong
the the federal government has to fix it
because it's national security
you can let the states experiment and
let the states do the thing and let the
states
take the lead on education in normal
times
as long as as long as they're getting
the job done
let the states educate the kids take the
lead
but if the states stop educating the
kids
it's a national security problem
because educated kids create a good
economy a good economy
allows you to have a good military and
protect yourself in a variety of ways
so certainly we're reaching a point
where the federal government might need
to
take control uh in some fashion
i would certainly like to see an
executive order that limited
the power of the teacher unions that
would be
one thing that might be productive and
uh because the teachers unions
apparently are
the i would say they're they're the base
problem for every problem in the united
states
right now and that's a big claim right
that the teachers unions
are the base problem for every big
problem
in the united states but it's true
because if you educated children better
uh if there were more options and it's
the teachers unions that
limit the options so you can't have
competition and a free market for
teaching therefore it can't evolve in
the way that it naturally would
to its best form and and
kids who are in bad school systems are
just trapped don't have an option
so as long as that situation exists
there's a national security issue there
and
uh that needs to get resolved now at the
same time
i'm completely on board with the notion
that
teachers did not sign up to be front
line
health care workers or they didn't
volunteer to be on the front line of a
war
now can we force them to do it just
because
it's a national security concern well
maybe
sort of kind of but we do have a
volunteer military
so we should have and we have a
voluntary
medical community we should have a
voluntary
teacher situation if the danger goes you
know is high like it is well it's not
high
but if there's a danger it just has to
be voluntary
in my opinion so
how can you best open schools and keep
everybody safe let me give you
this suggestion the kids themselves seem
pretty safe
if it's the teachers who are worried i
would offer this option
that teachers could have a an in-class
physical body who is either a young
person
or somebody who has recovered from
coronavirus and therefore
has presumably some protection and that
you could have
you could have the regular teacher on
video
all the time and you know they do the
class plans and
and the decision making but you have a
physical human being
in the classroom just to make sure that
anything physical gets taken care of
et cetera so that would be one model i
don't know if anybody's
considered that i do also like the
pod teaching model where the kids will
get together in
little groups and do some stuff at home
i i do like the pod idea but
as i've often said and let me put it in
this context
i think the pandemic as horrible and
tragic as it is
and the the lines for people in my town
who are lining up just to give food you
know food that's
uh delivered by some form of government
it's getting pretty long all right i
live in i live in a high-end
neighborhood and there was a pretty long
line for
food yesterday for food
so let's not forget that's still top
priority
uh but that said
there's a saying in business that if you
don't cannibalize your own products
your competition will so if you don't
make
your next version of your product so
good that all of your customers don't
want the last version
that's what your competitor will do
they'll make the version your customers
go to
and you need to continually destroy what
you have
in regular business to build the new
thing
so for a company like apple
destruction and creation happen at the
same time
they're destroying their old products by
creating the new products
school isn't like that school is just
sort of
ossified and it is what it is and it's
hard to change and there's not much
competition
if you could change that so that schools
could destroy themselves
while they're creating something better
in other words
free market free competition best one
survives the the bad one doesn't
that situation how much better could
school be
how much better probably a lot
what is your guess of how much better in
of course is like a conceptual number
but do you think that
the free market would make education 10
better because 10 percent
would be quite a big impact you know on
the size of the economy it'd be
quite quite big a 10 improvement
but is it more than 10 and maybe it's 50
percent
maybe it's 400 percent all right
because imagine if you had a better
learning experience somehow you got rid
of the bullies
you never had a bad teacher and
you learned the right things in the
right way
i feel like it's a it's a 4x benefit
it doesn't feel like a 10 benefit to me
to me it feels like a like a 400
kind of situation and again we're
talking about national security
you know we're talking about the economy
in the future because the kids
drive the economy in the future
i i think this is one of the biggest
opportunities this country's ever had
and this will be maybe a contrary and no
no i think it's not a contrarian
a lot of people are coming around to
this that the pandemic nobody would have
asked for it but it might fix the
tree yeah yeah and i say this all the
time that
the schools are even in my opinion and
therefore the
the teachers unions are the cause of
systemic
racism in this country now i'm playing a
little loose with the wording here
when i say the cause i mean the cause of
it being a problem
so systemic racism it really is built
into the fabric of everything
you know there's there's a ripple from
slavery that's real
but is it bothering oprah
no because if you're successful and you
have money and
you know your life is working well
systemic racism isn't hurting you much
so if you can simply improve education
prove the economics of anybody who's a
person of color
isn't that going to change their
situation and how they feel about
systemic racism even if it's still there
it'll be it'll be kind of like
background noise
all right
i've decided i want to see if i can
reclaim some of my humanity
by being less of a jerk on twitter
um if you follow me on twitter most of
you do
i think you know that i could be a jerk
sometimes
and i'm not proud of it i was reading an
article
yesterday about how social media
um sort of takes our humanity into a
conceptual place
where when i'm i'm singing somebody on
twitter
the sensation i get is as if it's a
video game
and that is really dangerous that's
really dangerous
i mean think about that and let me put
this in context
when i started out on twitter i had zero
followers
and i made it sort of my mission
not to cheat too much and use the
dilbert thing to
grow my twitter account i wanted to see
if i could grow it
by doing things that you do on twitter
and i wanted to talk about politics
and i wanted to see if i could grow
users
followers not users but followers
because i was doing the right things and
giving them something they wanted so
i sort of made a point of it to grow
organically
and so now i've got over half a million
half a million followers
and the thing that i'm cautioning myself
about
is that uh the thing i'm cautioning
myself about
is that when i had a hundred followers
if i weighed in on a twitter thread and
insulted somebody or said something
you know about them no impact right
100 followers no impact but i lost sight
of the fact
that my impact is fairly enormous now
because it happened gradually you know
you could just lose sight of it
and i realized a few times that i've uh
i saw something i didn't like on twitter
from
somebody somebody i don't know and i
would just
you know throw a throw a little slap out
there
you know like a little twitter slap and
i'd realize it had much bigger impact
than i wanted because a lot of followers
will pile on and
then suddenly there's some poor person
i've never even met
whose only offense is that they said
something i didn't like
and now they're being dumped on by half
a million people or
thousands and i'm gonna pull back a
little bit
now i'm gonna go just as hard against
the professionals
all right so the professionals still get
the full treatment
and i would expect that i would also
receive
the full dehumanizing treatment because
i'm a professional
you know i'm doing this in a
professional sense
so i'm not asking anybody to lighten up
on me
because the people who go into battle
knowing that that's what they're doing
that you know
you know what you're getting but i'm
gonna i'm gonna make an effort
and i don't think this is gonna be 100
successful
i don't think so but i'm going to try to
be
a little kinder to
civilians right so a little kinder to
civilians we'll see if that works out
and and let me tell you that the the
reason
that i'm doing this is as much
i'll tell you the insight i had about
this not just the insight that we're
dehumanizing ourselves
on social media but the insight is that
i get
continuous flow of of
messages from people who tell me that
i've changed their life in some positive
way
because you know a lot of my books are
about how to live your life better how
to think better
how to be more persuasive how to get
what you want and so a lot of people
have read my books
and actually got what they want i
tweeted one
this morning of somebody who whose life
was completely changed just by
a brief appearance on my periscope and
when i see how much i can change
people's lives in the positive
with the smallest amount of effort the
smallest amount of effort
and changes people's lives completely
i say to myself what have i done
accidentally
that actually damaged somebody's life
because i just wasn't thinking i was
just careless
and so i'm going to be less careless
about that well that's my intention
we'll see if i can do it
um this morning i sent off a very angry
tweet
that i later deleted man did it make me
angry
and i'll tell you what made me angry
about it and then why it was wrong
it was a it was a video clip about dr
fauci
he was responding to a member of
congress who was asking about the
the henry ford study on
the henry ford whatever medical facility
study about hydroc hydroxychloroquine
and zinc and the congress men said that
the study showed that it was effective
yeah and therefore
the implication is why don't we use it
and
dr fauci said that
uh that that was not a valid study for a
few reasons
number one it was not a uh
was what they call it a randomized
placebo trial it did not have a control
group
with the placebo it was not studied in
the
you know the way that you would get a
gold standard result
so the first thing you said was it did
not meet that standard
now i'm going to tell you in a moment
why that's
i think that's what triggered me because
uh it turns out that the study actually
is garbage
so here's the first thing and the reason
i deleted the tweet
is that as soon as i looked at what he
said
he is right
so i i did this scathing you know
insulting tweet to fouchy because of the
first thing i read
and then i looked at his claim and i
thought
ah okay this is a little more than i
thought
so the reason he said that the that the
uh
he gave two reasons to not believe the
study one of them is that it wasn't the
gold standard type of study which i'm
going to argue in a minute
he's misleading you but the other is
that it was
it was combined with a
another drug that we know works
so if you combine hydroxychloroquine
with the drug
that we already know works and you get a
good result
you've literally found out nothing
because it was the other drug
that made it work now i didn't know that
and i feel a little bit
stupid you know i feel like it's a
little bit my fault but a little bit the
media fault
because this is a really big point so
apparently the other drug
was uh what was it some kind of
some kind of steroid i guess that they
give you if you're
hospitalized it's some kind of
anti-inflammatory
steroid i forget what the name of it is
but here's what triggered me
so fauci says that you don't
know if the hydroxychloroquine worked in
that study
because it was given in combination with
a drug that you do know works
and and the result the outcome uh oh
thank you in the comments i'm being
reminded that the drug that
was with the hydroxychloroquine was a
dexamethasone and apparently that is
as i'm learning already a common
treatment
so it's a common treatment and it works
so if you know it works and you get
effectively the same result
with hydroxychloroquine added to it as
you would have gotten without it and i
think that's actually what happened
um then there is no evidence that the
hydroxychloroquine worked
so dr fauci okay you
you win this this round this round
goes to fouchy but this raises some
questions
were you aware that there was a drug
that would cut
death rates in half because that's what
we learned
that this dexamethasone is widely in use
and cuts the death rate in half
how come i didn't know that did you know
that
because we've heard about rem deserve
here we've heard about everything else
but did you know that if you get this
particular drug which is widely
available you know standard kind of a
drug
then it cuts your death rate in half
so some of you are saying saying you
heard of it some of you not
the the fact that the fact that as much
as i've studied this stuff you know as
a lay person not as a scientist but as
much as i've looked into this
why is today the first time i'm hearing
about this
which which should be a wake-up call
about how uninformed we are about all of
it
this is such a big missing piece
in what i knew about the whole situation
that it was
sort of mind-blowing and also very
humbling
it also reminds me that i'm a jerk
because i
went after fauci in public
on twitter being wrong
you know i tried to correct it but i was
wrong now
here's a but i do have some fouchy
criticisms
and i think what actually triggered me
is that
it was obvious he was lying but it
wasn't about this
so what he said about the dexamethasone
i think he's
completely right but it also tells you
that the henry ford study
was with hospitalized patients which
again is not the point right
it wouldn't matter if the study he said
was debunked
was a good study or not because i
wouldn't have believed it anyway
because the whole point of it is to use
it early and the henry ford study was
hospitalized people
and into hospitalized people that other
drug we know
works and have you seen any national
reporting
on who doesn't use the drug because what
i was wondering
who was the control group
who was the control group
if we know that this drug that was in
combination of hydroxychloroquine
cuts the death rate in half who was the
group that didn't get it
right can you how do we know that this
drug cuts the death rate in half
unless there's somebody not getting it
and
if we know it works why would anybody
not get it
so uh maybe we have a history
of people who didn't get it before but i
would be really suspicious
of any data before we were really
looking into it did it come from another
country
my guess is that in this country people
were probably getting it from day one
and was there a point where the death
rate went from you know
way high to half as much when that drug
started being widely used or was it
always widely used anyway i have lots of
questions
here's my fouchy criticism
you do want as dr fauci continuously
reminds us
if you really want to be certain
at least as certain as you can be about
a drug you have to do
the uh the rpt trial
the uh you know the one with the placebo
and
um randomized so
does that apply in every case here's the
problem
if you had a drug that was brand new
let's say a vaccine
something that never existed before you
would need
to know three things about it you would
need to know
the cost because that makes a difference
you would need to know if it hurts
people in the short run and the long run
and you would need to know if it was
beneficial
at all to the thing you're trying to
treat under those conditions
when you're trying to learn all three
things
what's it gonna cost which is separate
from the trial but it's part of a
decision
you're trying to find out harm and
benefit under those
conditions you absolutely need what dr
fauci says you need you need the double
blind you need the gold standard
or don't put that in anybody's body it's
just a bad idea
if you haven't tested but that's not our
situation is it
our situation is that hydroxychloroquine
in
low doses which is the only thing that's
recommended for the
the early early symptoms people
that that actually doesn't have a risk
because
let me not speak in absolutes rather
it's one of the safest drugs of all time
has been around 65 years as you all know
it's been tested to death
so given that the drug exists and has
been tested
percent of what you're trying to learn
in one of these gold standard trials
is unnecessary all right so you don't
need
uh the gold standard to find out half of
what you're trying to find out you
already know under those conditions
when the hydroxychloroquine is very
cheap i mean so cheap
it's like candy and you know it's safe
enough right nothing's 100 but
better than advil if you know it's that
safe
and that cheap and you know it might
work
because there's lots of indication that
it will work short of proof
this is a no-brainer dr fauci all right
so
when i saw dr fauci insist on the
you know the gold standard um the gold
standard to test
it looked like lying lying by omission
and what i mean by that is if he wasn't
willing to
express the view that i just gave
and either debunk it or embrace it i
feel like that's
lying meaning that if he can't give this
to the public
the same way that i told it to you or
to tell you why the way i told it to you
is clearly wrong
which could be the case he's lying
because every one of you listens to him
talking and says
but it's really cheap we know it's safe
and i i hear what you're saying that it
might not work because it hasn't
passed all these high levels of
standards that we'd all like to see
but there's a whole lot of suggestive
evidence so the risk management clearly
is weighted in one direction i mean
overwhelmingly
so dr fauci unless you can tell me why
the risk management as i described it
is wrong i don't want to hear you say
that you need a gold standard test
because that feels to me like a lie
it's a lie by omission and
when i heard him do that it triggered me
and
then i you know i i over tweeted
so i apologize to dr fauci for the
the tweet that i think was uh
was over the line in my case
all right um i think the election is
largely over
and i think biden is a dead man walking
and i say that because of a political ad
i saw
yesterday now you may say to yourself
scott scott scott
political ads don't really move the ball
that much
you know not that much but it's not so
much the ad
which was actually very good but the
idea
so the the ad carried an idea
that i hadn't seen exactly expressed and
when i saw it i said
oh i think it's over and the ad was
in it was in spanish
so it was a campaign ad for the united
states in spanish
in which you showed a number of uh
hispanic
famous people like aoc and there's so
there's some people on the left some
people on the right
so basically famous successful
hispanic americans and then it said
joe biden uh why why did you say that
you were going to pick
a black vice president and they
and they they say hispanics are
18 more than 18 percent of the country
the black population is 13ish
and so the hispanics are saying in the
ad
what's wrong with us yeah why would you
not
consider uh latin
latino latin is it latinx what's
what's the woke way to say it you know
i've never figured out by the way
the difference between hispanic and
latino latina
latinx uh i always think i'm going to
know the difference so i'm going to say
hispanic
we're not insulting anybody today um but
so forget about the fact that it was in
spanish forget about the fact that it
was a campaign ad
and people don't get too influenced by
them in my opinion
but that idea
that joe biden is flat-out racist
is really strong because
can you think of any time that trump has
ever made a government decision based on
entirely race you know i suppose you
could say
you know helping the funding of the of
the traditional
what is it the historically black
colleges
but you know i think people are mostly
on board with that that's pretty popular
i would guess
uh but biden saying that he would
he would definitely pick a black vice
president
when 18 of the country is hispanic we
just had
not not just but not too recently we had
you know two terms of obama
and you're not even going to consider
for a vice president
somebody who is in 18 of the population
and here's the thing that blew my head
off right and i think
uh i i think you're you might have the
same impression
if you're a white person in america
you've sort of come to accept maybe you
don't like it
but you've come to accept that it can't
be racist against white people
now of course in your private thoughts
you're thinking of course it can be
racist against white people
anything that discriminates against
anybody by race
is racist by definition but we also
understand that if you're if you're a
white person in america you're
part of a traditional class that had
some advantages not all of you
of course but many had advantages
and so you you sort of understand the
thinking even if you don't like it
right you're like ah i think i think
racism should be about everybody
but i get it that if you're if you're at
the
lower end of the economic poll it's
different right it's just not really the
same
to say that uh to use my my very own
example
i've lost several jobs for being a white
male
many of you know my stories about that
but
it's not the end of the world for me
because i had plenty of opportunities
things went fine so
when when people say that anybody is
being racist against white people
i have some thoughts about it but it's
not the end of the world
but i'm also not hispanic
imagine if you were hispanic and you
were not
traditionally the the dominant ethnic
group of the united states in terms of
economics
and the vice president just said or the
president
the candidate for president joe biden
you're president of your country
you know you're a citizen of the united
states
just like everybody else and the the guy
who wants to run for president
of your country just told you
that you're not good enough to be vice
president and that's what the ad said
that's the way they phrased it why
why why are we not good enough to be a
vice president
because we have the numbers we have the
numbers
and we we are not an historically
advantaged
population now you know obviously did
not come through the
you know the pathway of slavery so
that's a whole other story
but you know so you can make the
argument but here's the only thing i'm
going to add
if that point if that point gets
emphasized
i think it will that's really strong
and i would be curious to hear from
anybody who's a hispanic american who
saw that ad
or just hears the argument how do you
feel about it
because maybe you don't care it could be
that the people who made the ad
hoped other people would care and they
just don't um
and here's something else to blow your
mind a little bit
i feel as though the hispanic americans
have been the quietest
about systemic racism it feels that way
to me
right it feels like the lead is being
taken by both black and white
activists that's what i see anyway i'm
not sure if that's true but that's what
i see
and uh somebody said to me yesterday
that the reason is that the hispanic
community
just just cares less they're just sort
of not invested
as much in the whole racism racism
racism thing
they're not siding with anybody they're
just trying to get their work done and
have their life
you know just stay out of the way and
and not get into a fight that's not
their fight
don't have as much you know investment
in it for some reason
so the thing i don't know and i'd be
real curious to learn this in the next
week or so if anybody wants to anybody
wants to tweet at me or send me a
message
if you are hispanic american
how does it make you feel to know that
you anybody like you
can't be vice president under joe biden
how does that make you feel
because as a white person i say
well you know if biden's there and
there's been plenty of white presidents
i don't care you know fine with me but
i wouldn't feel the same if i were
hispanic i think i just don't know
dr fauci says that the reason that
europe has been able to contain the
virus better than the united states is
that they closed down
95 percent of their economies while the
us
only shut down 50 percent so
who who's the idiot there um so trump
closed the economy only 50 and then had
more deaths per capita but
but in europe those smart europeans they
went all the way to 95
to shut down and and got a better
death rate so they're the smart ones
right
yay europe they won i don't think so
here's my take on this from the
beginning
trump described the pandemic as a war
in wars you take casualties in battle
with the hope that you'll you'll win the
larger war
trump's approach and he said it directly
and he said a lot of times
is that it's a war
at the end of the war who won let's say
let's say that both europe and the
united states get to the end of the
pandemic whenever that is
and our death rate is higher
but our economy is better
right so our death rate is higher but
our economy is better
who won the war the war is with china
right the pandemic is just sort of you
know part of the war
but the long-term war is with china
and whoever has the strongest economy is
going to have the strongest
defense and the the most ability to
survive in the future so we don't know
how
europe and the us will come out of this
but i would argue
that if the u.s economy if the u.s
economy
goes up like a whole level something
that's really
you know obvious and measurable and and
sustained
if it goes up a level and europe let's
say goes down or doesn't go up
and it causes like a a permanent
situation
of more american economic power relative
to europe
who was smarter even if we had
a pretty grotesquely higher death rate
let's say we lost
i don't know 50 000 people that we
didn't need to lose if we'd done it the
european way
how long would it take for us to recoup
the 50 000 dead people obviously they
don't pop back to life
but a strong economy can keep other
people alive who would have otherwise
perished and can keep the country safe
from
external threats in a way that you can't
if you don't have money
so i feel as if
trump told us it was a war
told us there would be casualties
kept kept the economy you know open-ish
and uh basically went to war
and and as commander-in-chief
he knew he would take casualties in the
short term
but the the point of it is to win the
war not the individual battles every
time
and i feel as though when this is all
said and done
and we're looking back at it in five
years if the u.s
economy got a permanent sustained
bump from you know relative relative to
europe
i'm going to say trump won and i'm going
to say europe lost the war
but we don't know that that'll happen
that's just i'm just setting that up
right now um
so of course republicans and democrats
are
arguing about the coronaville
coronavirus
relief bill which means the checks
aren't going out
which means that people will be unable
to eat and pay the rent
and here's what i would suggest
given that the total amount of printed
money and new
debt if you will that we've already done
uh
don't we owe something like 28 trillion
dollars you know at this point the
national debt
the the difference between the smaller
number
or or even the difference in how they
want to spend it
i would recommend that you just give
both the democrats and the republicans
everything they've asked for because
it's not going to make
it's just not going to make much
difference so in other words
democrats and republicans they they have
a different
ideas of how much to spend on each
category of thing
i would say take the biggest number that
either one of them have
for every category and pick it just pick
the biggest number
that the republicans want for let's say
tax cuts
and the biggest number that uh the
the democrats want for social services
just take the biggest number and just
freaking get it done
so you can feed some people because that
difference to our total national debt
at this point at this point is sort of
lost in the rounding unfortunately
you know somebody says 100 trillion
what was 28 trillion was 28 trillion
not this year right that that would be
too big
all right so i don't have any of my
numbers right but the the basic idea is
the way to solve this difference in
congress is to give both sides
everything
give both sides everything
and just feed the people because
otherwise people die from starvation and
stuff
like i you know i'm not going to argue
about another
three percent on the um the national
debt
if people are starving so
uh the debt yeah i need to check my
numbers i don't know enough about
national debt
20 trillion i'm seeing people throwing
some numbers out in the
comments
somebody says you do 28 trillion is the
current
total debt current total debts
all right so that's not annual that's
how much we've racked up
over time all right so if you're going
to add
to your 28 trillion dollar total debt
one more trillion than you wanted to
i think if this is the time to do it
just throw it in there
throw it in there and see if that helps
all right
i think i've talked about everything
that matters today
uh somebody says people
should be able to sue their employers if
they get sick
i don't know maybe
i don't know i'd have to think about
that one because that's that's got some
real trade-offs
all right somebody says not hearing or
seeing hunger reported
other than here yeah um
so far it's my understanding that nobody
starved to death
and i think we have to pat ourselves in
the back a little bit for that as
as a america because remember early on
um when we first we first were
presented with the pandemic and i was
trying to calm
the fears of my audience and i said
we're not going to run out of food so i
i said that
as hard as i possibly could that we're
not going to run out of
food and so far not
so i i think that's really a credit to
us you know you see everything we do
wrong but you don't see the things we
did right
so you know let's give a standing
ovation to the
food supply chain in the united states
you know just a tremendous number of
people
taking risks you know the the
meatpackers
i mean the the food industry in this
country
basically went to war you know if you
think about it
the the food workers especially the meat
packers
settler who were exposed they went to
war
they didn't want to i'm sure it sure
wasn't their first choice
but the alternative was that their
fellow citizens
starved to death so it's a little
different than teachers you know because
you
can you get a little bit more a little
bit more flexibility with
education but the the food workers of
america
heroes absolute heroes
because they kept us fed so um
so somebody asked about dershowitz i
understand there's an interesting
um interview with him that i haven't
seen yet so i'm gonna look at that in a
bit
and i will talk to you tomorrow
