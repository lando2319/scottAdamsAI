don't look at the whiteboard yet
yeah
the whiteboard is going to be lit today
a lot of fun
yep some of you will enjoy it and some
of you won't but one thing i can
guarantee and the word is already out
this
will be
the best
experience of your entire life this live
stream yeah i know that's a big claim
but watch me satisfy it but first all
you need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker gels a steiner canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for
the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that's going to make everything better
especially your antibodies it's called
the simultaneous sip it's going to
happen now all around the world go
antibodies
oh yes
so
how many of you have read a book called
god's debris
written by me back in
2001 when was it yeah
wow a lot of you
wow
on the locals platform where their
subscribers
is just lighting up with yeses i didn't
expect that
now i understand
so there was a mystery that i couldn't
figure out which is why anybody would
follow me
or why anybody would subscribe
and i think i just found the answer a
huge number of the subscribers
percentage-wise anyway
i have read my book god's debris
it would be hard to read that book and
not want to hear more
about that kind of thing so that
actually explains why people are
subscribing i was kind of i was actually
kind of surprised
when i went to locals and said well you
can get some extra stuff
content and whatnot if you subscribe and
i wasn't sure anybody would
but
that actually answers a big mystery for
me now here's what i want to tell you
about that
that book was written to change the
world
slowly
it was written
by a hypnotist me
and it was written with hypnosis
technique
now that was the first book i wrote
where i
explicitly laid on the hypnosis
technique for the reader
and the reason was to produce a an
experience
in the reader that you couldn't get just
from reading an ordinary book so the the
hypnosis technique
plus the story of the book added
together
gave some people
profound experiences i'm watching some
of the comments go by on locals people
talk about it it changed my world
um a lot of people's entire world view
was just completely scrambled often when
they were young and never and it never
never went back to normal
but here's the thing you don't know
that book is why i can do this
because there were enough people who
read that book who said you know i'm
going to promote your voice because i
liked what you said in that book
so i it's not an accident that i became
a prominent voice
about other stuff
because the people who read that book
sort of pushed me to the
to the front of the line
that's what happened
but the book itself has changed in the
world in ways that i can't tell you
right now
but
you'll see
you'll see
it was meant to have a 20 or 30 year
impact
and so far so good
i didn't realize how many states don't
have
mass mandates for kids
or at least mass mandates in general so
the ones that do are let's say
california where i am illinois new york
and washington still mandatory those are
the only
ones that true
i feel like this fact is not right are
there only four states with mandatory
masks
and i happen to be one of the lucky ones
somebody says indiana does
this
organize them yeah maybe this was about
schools was it only about schools
lots of local mandates yeah maryland uh
maybe this was just about schools so i
guess uh i don't know the facts on this
i saw this in the news but it didn't
look right to me so i think
i misinterpreted it
anyway uh there's a new university have
you heard of this
so a new university opened up
uh or it's opening i guess it's being
founded now the university of austin
and it will uh barry weiss talked about
it on substack
and it's committed to quote freedom of
inquiry freedom of conscience and civil
discourse so in other words free of
wokeness
so sort of a non-woke
or non-overly woke
university and how many uh how many
professors do you think immediately
tried to get a job there
how many professors immediately wanted
to leave the university where they
currently work and get the hell out of
there and go to go to this place where
they can actually say actual real things
hundreds
apparently a lot of people are applying
for this job
so once again it looks like the
the free market has solved the problem
that politics can't
how often does that happen
a lot right there's going to be some
more of that in this very live stream
i'll tell you some more of it
but every time we think the government
or you know society is needs to do
something differently you just wait a
while
and commerce
and the free market just solves the
problem that you were
you know talking about and doing nothing
about
so
maybe we just wait maybe maybe colleges
are so
so poorly thought of right now that
there's a giant opening for competition
i think that's what's going to happen
here's an example of it
well there's a i saw a tweet about
some scientific people tried to figure
out
uh if our universe were a simulation
if if this were a simulation how much
data would it take
to create the simulation and of course
the the number is trillions times
trillions times trillions
an enormous amount of data if this were
a simulation in fact so much data that
it's hard to imagine that any advanced
civilization could even create such a
thing
but
of course that analysis makes the
critical problem and mistake
that you don't need to program all of it
you only have to make the characters
think they're seeing all of it that's it
that's easy
programming an entire universe just in
case somebody saw it
would be stupid
the easier way to do it is to program
the humans to think they're seeing
something in detail but they're not
let me give you an example
if somebody hits a tennis ball fast
and it goes near the line
you say to yourself okay that was in or
that was out
and you're pretty sure because you saw
it
saw it with your own eyes
except often when the replay goes the
replay shows the ball hitting a
completely different place
than you clearly saw with your own eyes
how could that be
how could you clearly see something
that on the replay simply didn't happen
and the reason is that's how everything
works
everything you see isn't really
happening it's just a
it's just a quick summary that your
brain ginned up
to make you think you're seeing
something that makes sense
you're seeing just a little cartoon of
what's happening it's not accurate it's
just what your brain gave you
so your brain said oh there's that
tennis ball
and it's you know it's inner resound and
then you see that you are completely
wrong
but it doesn't change your memory
your memory is still there
right so everything you see
is an approximate picture
for something that you didn't see
clearly
where you couldn't see the details you
couldn't see behind it you couldn't see
you know you couldn't see its atomic
structure
you can only see the present you can't
see the past you can't see the future i
mean the amount that we can see
is so tiny compared to what's here
that's how you can program all that
information you just make the only
characters who matter
think they're seeing it all
they're not they're just programmed to
think they are
so
uh that's the first thing
all right i'm gonna talk i'm gonna go
back and forth to the simulation idea as
i talk through the other stuff
um i have a theory and this is how we're
gonna find out
how many of you are npcs do you know
what an npc is
it's a gaming um
it's a gaming term for people who do
online games and it refers to a
a non-player character
so if you're playing a game you might
inhabit a character in the game and so
you're a live character meaning your
avatar or the little simulated creature
is using your intelligence to guide it
but in the game
there would be other just scenery like
people that you might interact maybe
enemies that you shoot etc those those
characters don't need a full set of
feelings and experiences
they only need to act in a few different
ways
and you'll think oh
they must be people because you're not
interacting with them
so they would look like they're full
people but they don't have to be they
could be
limited program scenery kind of people
now how would you know
if somebody that you know is an npc
if we're a simulation
versus a player character
well i'm going to add a new little mind
bender here
what if
sometimes you're an npc and sometimes
you're live
just the way you dream
think of it
if you think you're a real you're not a
simulation you're a real character you
think you dream at night
and then you live your real life during
the day but did you notice that your
dream was pretty specific with the
memories and stuff
but we count that it was not real
what if
your avatar
lives when you're asleep in the other
world
and it just keeps interacting in the
game
but it turns into an npc because it
can't do much
how much of your day
do you spend being creative and coming
up with new ideas and you're clearly a
real player in a real in a real some
kind of reality
but other times you're tired
and you can only say a few things have
you ever had that experience if you're
you know you're just worn out
and and somebody says how you feel you
just go
fine
what do you want to do
i don't know what do you want to do
you see where i'm going
sometimes you might be real and
sometimes you might be the npc
because you are whoever is running you
is asleep in the other world
so you just run around like a a
semi-programmed automaton who can only
do limited things now do you know
anybody in your real life
who can only
respond with about five different
responses
i know somebody in real life who can
only say one of five things all day long
every day no matter what else is
happening
only five things
no matter what you say they can only
respond with one of those five things
yeah you all know somebody like that
don't you
all right and what happens if you try to
bring up a new topic
to somebody who only has five things
that they can say
i'll tell you what happens when i do it
they will stare at you
and when you're done talking what will
they do
will they engage with you in this new
topic
never
they will just look at you
pause and then say one of the five
things that they say
every time now do you know people who
will always say if you talk about the
simulation they'll say oh that's like
the matrix
that's probably an npc
if you're talking about food sources
somebody always says oh that's like soil
and green
npc
they're just programmed to say the same
thing in every topic
now when we talk when i talk about pete
bootage in a while
you're going to find out if you're an
npc
here's how you'll find out
i'm going to tell you some things that i
think are good about be buddha judge in
his current job and some things that i
think
are not so good
if you can handle that you're probably a
real player
if you can handle he's got some
positives he's got some negatives you're
a real player but
if you pick one of the negatives and say
we're done here
you might be an npc
because the npc would be programmed to
pick the first thing it heard
on his team and just go with it
because it's simpler
so if your news programmed you to say
buddha jed took too much time off
then you're going to say that and you're
going to be done
because that's all you got you're an npc
so you'll find out if you're nbc in a
bit hold that thought
cnn has oh let's talk about big bird and
do you think that uh your the government
should be directly
persuading your children to take drugs
such as a vaccination
apparently big bird and
sesame street is part of the
pro-vaccination persuasion for children
now
that wouldn't be fine maybe if all
parents agreed
about vaccinations
but they don't
and so now you've got the government
directly persuading your kids
presumably to persuade you the way they
did with climate change
and is this ethical
i would say deeply unethical
will it work that might
well probably it probably will work
because it'll make the kids you know
more likely to want to get vaccinated
maybe less afraid et cetera but um it's
deeply unethical what do you agree
because it's uh essentially taking the
parent's job
now the the assumption here is that the
parents are doing a good job
or not doing a good enough job
if um
if if they haven't told their kids the
right stuff about vaccinations but
that's a pretty big
and inappropriate assumption by a
government i think so i'm gonna be on
the side that says
the sesame
seed stuff sesame seed
sesame street
and big bird persuasion is unethical
anybody agree
agree or disagree i say purely unethical
all right i think we agree here's some
fake news from
cnn cnn's fake news is sometimes right
on the nose meaning it's just a lie
but more often is more clever than that
so here's some fake news today
uh an article saying that why joe biden
can't do much to ease gas prices
do you believe that
that's the title of the piece
do you believe that joe biden can't do
much to use gas prices now i guess he
can tap into the
reserve
but that's not any kind of long-term
anything
isn't this an obvious lie
it feels like an obvious lie that the
president can't do anything to use gas
prices
don't you think that all he'd have to do
is ease up on pipelines and drilling
and suddenly the market would adjust
because the market is forward-looking
right
so if the market saw that the united
states just took the cap off of its
production
you wouldn't have to wait for opec you
wouldn't have to wait for russia you
would just make as much as you needed
domestically and prices would come down
am i wrong about that
now i don't think that anything would
happen on day one
that would actually
change the you know the supply and
demand
but certainly the you know the since
markets are forward-looking they would
probably lower the prices in
anticipation of more demand or more
supply
right
so i think that's just fake news
and they and they can do this because
people are not sophisticated and they
think well there's nothing you can do
about it i guess that's all i know
nothing he can do about it but basically
they're trying to cover biden's biggest
flaw in my opinion
that he destroyed the energy
industry in this country or degraded it
when he took office
so it looks like they're just trying to
cover for him
how many of you think that kovid was
just a a flu
still
in the comments
how many of you still believe
that the covid was just sort of a bad
flu and we could have just ignored it
i'm seeing uh some yeses and no's a mix
yeses nose poisoning no no no yes yes
yes well i'm not going to answer that
question for you but i'll tell you what
some of the official numbers are
so a new estimate of course you can't
trust any estimates
or anything else
don't trust any estimates or predictions
or data
but here are some
uh according to the oecd countries the
uh i don't know european blah blah
countries i forget what's in that group
but um
the the calculation is that uh covet
contributed to a 1616
increase in the expected number of
deaths in 2020
and 2021.
um do you believe that do you believe
that there were 16 percent more deaths
than there normally would be and it was
because of covet now remember you have
to factor in
the number of people who died because of
the lockdown right that's not zero i
don't know what that number is
so i see lots of skeptics
i will uh show some love for the
skeptics
if your take on this is that the people
telling us about this sort of generally
speaking are the same people who've lied
about
everything
then
should you should you be confident that
these numbers are true no
no
you should not have any confidence that
these numbers are true i'm just telling
you what the official numbers are right
but if you said oh therefore it's true
i don't think so
it's just the official numbers i
wouldn't say that they're true
i just say they're the numbers all right
um apparently the same same group or
same article is telling us that the
alleged number of people who died
worldwide has passed 5 million
do you think that 5 million people died
from covet
how many of you think 5 million died
from covid
nope you don't believe that either right
okay
again i i will give full respect
to the critics
you know i i don't know if you've
noticed that i i try to try to have some
nuance here on what is credible versus
what is true
so those who are doubting these numbers
you are both credible
and uh i respect it
i don't think you're right
but i'm sort of guessing
so are you
that's why i don't have more respect for
my own opinion than i do for yours
because i feel like we don't really know
i feel like we could be lied to at this
level
yes
i also have
the concern that you do
which is if somebody dies with five
comorbidities and a coveted diagnosis
wasn't the coven simply the last thing
that happened
is that really the cause
right is that how we use that word the
cause
is always the last thing that happened
because it was the smallest thing that
happened
if the last thing that happened is also
the smallest thing
why do you call that the cause what
about the fact that you're 100 years old
and you have terminal cancer and type 2
diabetes and you haven't walked in three
years
those seem like pretty big reasons for
dying
the covenant was the smallest part it
was just the last thing that happened
so
i don't know would you call that a cause
so something happened how and then you'd
have to put
so suppose there was a 16 increase in
the expected number of deaths
but
if it was highly concentrated in people
who were going to die anyway pretty soon
did it make any difference
you could look at these same numbers and
say yeah that basically nothing happened
just people who were 100 died at you
know 100 instead of 101. i'm
exaggerating a little bit to make the
point
yeah you could certainly make the
argument that in terms of the number of
deaths if you counted it a different way
it looks more flu-like but how many of
you believe the regular flu kills 50 000
people a year ago
so you were all skeptics about the
uh or most of you were skeptics about
the coven numbers but how many think the
real flu the just an ordinary flu how
many think that kills 50 000 a year
and yet i've never met anybody who died
of
it some of you do right
i would argue that if you believe the
coveted numbers
you probably should also believe the
regular flu numbers
but if you don't believe the regular flu
numbers and i don't
why would i believe the coven numbers
because to me the regular flu numbers
seem
based on my life of um doing data
analysis and you know trying to research
stuff just a life experience kind of a
instinct or hunch
backed by a little bit of knowledge but
mostly hunch i don't think the regular
flu deaths are real
nothing like 50 000 a year i think that
that number is so that we will be scared
into getting the shot that's what i
think
however if you talk to people who
survive to covet they will tell you
the tim pools and the joe rogans it's no
walk in the park when you get this even
if you're healthy
so even if you're young and healthy
you're going to get hit by something
that you don't think is a regular flu
it's going to feel a little different
so
all right
so much today rasmussen has a uh
poll that says uh
biden is down to a new uh approval low
so biden's approval he only has approval
by 27 of independents now
essentially our elections are determined
by you know turnout
and which way the independents go
and the independents have completely
left
uh biden do you think the independents
have also left
lower level democrats
probably i don't know if it's the same
number
but it feels like it
as somebody noted 27 percent is about
that 25
of the public who gets everything wrong
no matter what the question is you can
depend on 25 percent of the public
getting getting all the wrong answers no
matter what
and here we've got 27 percent of
independence are still with biden so
sort of supports that theory
um rasmussen also says that biden
abide in an endorsement let's say
somebody else is running as a democrat
and biden comes in to endorse them
51 percent of people polled say that
they're le that would make them less
likely to vote
for that candidate
now that might be mostly a partisan
answer but if you look at the trump
endorsement
in the same poll they asked if trump
endorsed somebody
would that make you more or less likely
to vote for him and it was sort of a tie
you know 38 39
but i suspect that that's it's a tough
effect to measure in a poll
because turnout is more important
right so if trump gets you to go to the
poll
that counts more than just changing your
mind right
so
it looks like a trump endorsement might
be a positive where a biden endorsement
might be a negative so we'll see if that
plays out
if you're following the kyle rittenhouse
case
uh apparently the trial is over but the
lawyers don't know it yet
and by that i mean
the prosecution has shown that they have
zero evidence
and i don't know that they have any more
evidence coming
let me say that again
the prosecution
didn't have any evidence
they're prosecuting him for homicide
without evidence
meaning that they did present stuff
but when you heard it you said to
yourself well what i'm hearing sounds
exactly like self-defense
what else you got well we also have this
okay
that sounds exactly like self-defense
wait i'm not done we also have this
aha
but even with the facts you're
presenting
your own facts that sounds like
self-defense
so as far as i know
there's literally no evidence of a crime
you don't think that the prosecutor knew
that before taking it to
trial
do you think the prosecutor was unaware
that there was no evidence
i'm ready to start cursing up a streak
but i'm going to pull
back because i think the rittenhouse
thing will end in a way that i'm not too
unhappy with so i'm going to let it play
out
but
what looks like what happened
is a uh i'm going to call him a criminal
a criminal prosecutor
uh lied this is what it looks like on
the surface we can't know because we
can't read his mind right but on the
surface what it looks like
is a a criminal prosecutor
did a criminal prosecution and he was
the criminal
the only the only person who committed a
crime in my opinion is the prosecutor
because he had to know he didn't have
evidence
and so he's ruining this kid's life
possibly uh with this trial they had no
evidence
so i would think that the prosecutor
should go to jail for this
am i wrong
let me ask you
has that ever happened
has a prosecutor ever gone to jail
for pressing a a trial where there was
no evidence
is that a thing
i've never heard of it
but this clearly looks like a crime to
me
or they just say oh you're incompetent
and that's it
so maybe a uh
oh the duke lacrosse d.a but
uh i don't know how much lying you have
to do you can get disbarred sure
but i think you'd have to go to jail for
this
he hasn't broken a law
you
maybe
uh but i would think that uh kyle's
gonna get a big payday out of this now
here's the other thing that uh jack
posabic noted today on twitter
that uh
at least four
uh news entities
are referring to the the last
witness that we heard of in that trial
as the lone survivor
they're calling one of the witnesses who
was shot by rittenhouse a lone survivor
because the others died
does that feel does that feel fair he's
the lone survivor
because that basically tells you that
somebody was killing people and one got
away
that's not exactly
a fair way to characterize this is it
here's another thing you could say
he was the only attacker who survived
is that fair he's the only attacker who
survived the attack
now attack
could be for good reasons could be for
bad you know sounds bad if you say
attacker
but they were the attackers
they were the attackers
so why not call him that but they
he's also a lone survivor
but pretty biased
on twitter
the trial is referred to this way this
is the headline on twitter so that
twitter puts the the headlines on some
of these stories
homicide trial of kyle rittenhouse
continues in kenosha is that fair
is it fair to say that the homicide
trial
continues because when you hear it's a
homicide trial
don't you sort of think he's guilty
don't you
because how many homicide trials do not
end in conviction or
something
right
i mean
it's a homicide trial technically i get
that
but
at this point wouldn't you call it a
false accusation trial
when you say it's a trial that has no
evidence of homicide
it's an evidence-free homicide trial
if this were trump
yeah they'd call the homicide trial i
guess
but you can imagine if this were
somebody they liked
the headline with something would be
something like
no evidence of a crime
in the in the written house case
i think that would be a lot more fair
um and this ridden house situation i
think is part of the larger uh
demonization of men wouldn't you say
how much of the written house case is
about gun control
and how much about that is uh
diminishing the role of men in society
because what kyle rittenhouse did was
he said hey i think there's a problem
happening and i'm a man
and i can go help
so is he he's been criticized
for having the attitude that he's a man
and he has some resources i guess he had
some medical
experience
and he had firearms so he could protect
people he said i'm going to go try to
help
and then when the trouble started
kyle ryden house did what a man does
when somebody points a gun at you with
bad intentions
you kill him
or you shoot him
that's what men do
and he's on trial
for being a man
make no
don't be confused he's not on trial for
a crime
he's on trial for being a man in 2021.
yeah
how many of you just
felt that
probably the men more than the women
right but if you're a man and i just
told you that kyle rittenhouse is on
trial
he's on trial for being a man
that's really happening
he's on trial
for being a man
and let me tell you a lot of men are
watching
this man can you back me up on this
men
you're watching this aren't you
and i'd like to uh
give some advice to the women who are
watching this
watching this not just this live stream
but the women who are watching the uh
kyle rittenhouse situation
here's my advice to the women watching
that
i don't care what your opinion
is on it
because this is about men
just stay out of it
yeah it's a free country and you're
you're willing of course you can have
your opinion but my opinion is you
should stay the out of it
if you're a woman
in return
in return
i will stay the out of the abortion
question
because that's not my beat
right i want the women to work that out
and let me know how you did
women work out the abortion that's your
deal and i'll back you on it
on the written house trial
women stay the out of it just stay
the out of this yeah you can have
an opinion but keep it to yourself
that's what i would ask you just keep it
to yourself the men have to work this
out
right i don't know the composition of
the jury
but i'm pretty sure they're going to get
them off
and at this point
the men of the world
who are watching this are going to
embrace kyle
like you've never seen before
assuming he gets off
am i right
i'm pretty sure that the men in america
are going to make sure that kyle
rittenhouse's life
goes better than it would have otherwise
i think he's going to get job offers
i think he's going to get opportunities
and he showed the world
what a man
is or can be
now you don't have to say that you buy
into that definition of what a man is or
should be
i don't really care
i don't care if you do or not
uh
it's just of no interest to me
all i'm saying is that women just stay
out of this one and i'll stay out of
abortion
fair
all right
a lot of you think that doing your own
search research is a good idea let me
talk you out of that
okay
number one doing your own research
can be a great
idea if all you're doing is learning
let's say you wanted to learn how to do
a thing
do your own research
you know take a class too
but doing your own research is probably
a good idea so if you're just learning
something
and there's nobody on the other side
it's not a it's not a topic where there
are two teams you're just learning
something absolutely do your own
research in fact you should do as much
as possible
but
in this specific situation
in which you've got a
very complicated big topic and people
are on different sides
what happens
if you have a complicated topic
and then you add a bunch of money to it
what will happen every
time all right christine i've got to
stop and make this comment christine on
youtube says
both issues are important to men and
women sorry you're wrong
did i did i say they weren't important
christine did you hear me say anything
about the lack of importance to one of
the genders
no
now you're arguing with your own
imagination
if you'd like to argue with my point
i welcome you
but don't argue with your own
imagination
i i acknowledge that these are important
to both men and women i'm just saying
stay out of it if you want a better
outcome
and i'll stay out of yours all right
um if you have a complicated topic and
you add money to it
what will be the outcome assuming it
stays complicated every time
the outcome will be
you're going to get mostly fraud what
would be an example of this
let's take the finance industry is the
finance industry a big complicated thing
yes
and there's tons of money poured into it
yes
is it mostly fraud
is the is the nation's finance system
mostly fraud
i'm seeing yeses and no's
see people say partially have i gone too
far
have i gone too far to say it's mostly
fraud
it's mostly fraud
it's mostly fraud
how many
financial
consultants
are giving you unbiased advice that's
good for you
versus
just
yeah how many are giving you unbiased
advice none
because the business model of financial
advisors is to make more money from
financial advisors
so all front the financial advice
business is completely corrupt it's all
fraud
right
the if a if a financial advisor were
honest
they couldn't charge you
because there wouldn't be enough content
i tried to write a book on finance once
and when i realized the whole book could
fit on one page i couldn't write the
book
everything else is just fraud
the part that you need to know is like
one page that's it
buy index funds hold them
done
so
then look at
anything from climate change to whatever
do you think that climate change
what percent of climate change a big
complicated topic with tons of money
going into it what percentage of that
outcome do you think was fraud
well some would say the entire solar uh
solar power industry is fraud you know
that's more of an opinion than a fact
but the fraud would be that it can't
really get us to where we need to and
the the cells themselves are a big
pollution problem
etc
it looks like the the entire thing is
just
filled with fraud i don't know what
percentage
now look at the supply chain issue
right big complicated thing if we throw
a bunch of money at that or let's say
infrastructure
if we have a big complicated thing like
infrastructure and throw a bunch of
money at it or even the bill let's say
the infrastructure bill do you think
that's mostly fraud
there's plenty of it in there i'm sure
so i'll just make this point now let's
say you do your own research
you dig into this
what are you going to find
do you think you're going to be able to
sort out what the fraud is and what
isn't maybe a little bit
but these big complicated things are big
and complicated for a reason
and part of the reason is it hides fraud
so when you go to do your research
you're going to be running into
mostly
because the fraudsters need you to hit a
solid wall of because they're
hiding behind it
right food industry another perfect
example right
so when you've got to do your own
research you're going to hit that wall
of that needs to exist so that
the fraud can hide safely behind it and
you won't know if you hit a wall of
 or if you found the truth
finally you won't know
because it's good
let me give you an example of how hard
it would be to do the uh
analysis let's say climate change here's
new news today see if you knew this
the new updates to global co2 emissions
in the gcp
they're revised them now
and the new data shows that global co2
emissions have been flat
if not slightly declining over the past
10 years
what
what
um
what
are you serious
the global carbon project projects the
fossil emissions in 2021 will reach blah
blah
well that wasn't important to the point
but the point is the co2 has actually
been falling over the past 10 years and
a lot of it has to do with land use i
guess we did good things there
some have had to do with gas replacing
worse worse sources
um
but did you know that
did you know that co2 emissions have
been
flat or declining
so here's the problem do your own
research and you can find any any
outcome you want
things are getting better or they're not
i don't think you could understand
climate change without at least being
familiar with the work of michael
schellenberger
so if you want to see the you know
the uh
the climate change analysis that
considers both the risks and the rewards
the pros and the cons without taking a
political side
that's michael sheldenberger's work so
follow him on twitter and read his books
and i'll go so far as to say if you're
not familiar with his work you probably
don't have a good opinion on climate
change you probably don't anyway because
it's hard to have a good opinion on that
but if you don't follow him you're
really you're kind of lost honestly
did you know that by 2022 this is from
shellenberger too the u.s had reduced
its emissions 22 percent below the 2005
levels and mostly because we were using
gas to replace coal
and i think biden reversed that right am
i right
not sure
all right um
so
beware what you think about climate
change you can research it all day and
still not have a good opinion so elon
musk offered to sell 10 of his tesla
shares apparently the context is that
since he doesn't take a salary
he would normally pay no taxes while
being the richest person in the world
and people say well that's not fair
that's not fair i pay taxes and you
don't pay taxes and you're the richest
person in the world so elon musk said
okay i'll pay some taxes i'll do i'll do
a poll and if the public wants me to
sell 10 of tesla just to pay taxes
because if he sells some stock he had to
he would have to pay i don't know
up to half of it in in capital gains so
that would be billions of dollars he
would pay in taxes
and i think he would do that largely for
public concern
because he's not a taxpayer
maybe he'd like to be now first of all
he is a taxpayer right because the
business pays various taxes
but here's what i would like to ask you
my smart audience which i know is far
more educated than the average
is the country better off if musk pays
taxes
or does what he continues to do which is
take no salary and pour enormous amounts
or percentage of his wealth into new
projects
which one of those is better are we
better off as a country
including the poor
are the poor better off if musk pays
more taxes
the answer is
really really easy on this one you don't
need a degree of economics
to get this one and if but if you don't
have a degree of economics it might not
be obvious so i'll say it and then once
you hear it you're gonna say oh
where do you want money to be
if you want the economy to do well where
do you want the money to be
you want the money
to be allocated wherever it will have
the most
chance of turning into more money agreed
now of course you've got to feed the
feed people and stuff but once you've
taken care of the basics you need every
dollar to go where it will be most
productive
do you think that elon musk's dollar
should go to the government
or to the guy who sent a car into space
that's that's the question
let me say it again with the f word
again because you need that
do you think that dollar
is better in the hands of the government
or in the hands of a guy
who put an automobile
in space
just for fun
i mean that being an example of the
types of things he's accomplishing
there's no contest right
there's no contest
musk is obviously
making the point and i think he's doing
this cleverly because it makes us talk
about it
if you're bad at economics you think
that he should pay taxes if you're good
at economics you don't want him to pay a
penny
you do not want him to pay a penny in
taxes
you want him to do what he keeps doing
which is pouring money into good ideas
that keep working
and make the country you know a leader
in areas where we need to be a leader
basically
so
you know if let's just take one example
ai will probably determine the the
safety of the country in the future
and uh you know musk heavily invests in
ai and i bet he's probably one of the
most
productive people in that area
you don't want him to stop
you don't want him to have one dollar
less
to do that
right not at all
all right but i love the fact that musk
is making us think about it with this
provocative question do you want me to
pay taxes and it forces people like me
to educate people who didn't know it
that him paying taxes is the worst idea
that the united states could ever have
seriously think of a worse idea
than taking money away from elon musk
and giving it to the government
can you think of anything that would be
worse than that i can't think of
anything
it should go the other way
the government should be paying elon
musk
to do more cool stuff
all right
um i do i also invest in tesla i should
tell you every once in a while i'll tell
you what things i'm invested in because
it does
bias me but i invested in him recently
you know because i like what's happening
not
uh it's not the other way
all right um
let's talk about mayor beat
i provocatively said today that i
believe he is exactly the right person i
would want in the job of uh
figuring out where the infrastructure
money should go
and
i'm going to support that
now here's where you find out if you're
an npc
i'm going to give you the pros and i'm
going to give you the cons and i'm not
going to hide either one
okay if you picked one of the cons and
said oh i'm done here you're probably an
npc
if you weighed the two things it doesn't
matter which way you go
well you're probably a real player
so now you can find out if you're a real
player all right
here's the argument for him being the
right person
he is a ex-mckinsey guy ex-harvard guy
and it's a really complicated hard
analysis
mckinsey consultants are taught to go
into an industry with which they are not
deeply familiar
to learn from the experts
to put the experts opinions and data
through a logical sort of filter that
mackenzie teaches them and to come out
with the most rational
decisions that make the most sense all
things considered
right
there is nobody i've ever seen in the
government
there may be but i just don't know of
any who would ever be more perfectly
suited
for this exact task
in fact
if you didn't have a bootage at the head
of it it would be smart for them to hire
mackenzie
to help them make these decisions i
don't know if the government does that
does the government ever hire mckenzie
probably right
i assume
but if if he were not already the right
one he should hire somebody like him the
first thing he would do in that job is
hire a p buddha judge to help him make
the decisions now he probably is
he probably is hiring a p buddhij
to to help him with the analysis and
then you know he could also know if it
were done right but
so tell us
his uh
before we go on
we'll talk about his failure as a mayor
blah blah we'll get to that so before i
talk about the reasons he's not the
right choice and i'll talk about him
will you agree with my first point
that his talent stack is exactly the one
you'd want
yes or no
just the talent experience part
mostly yeses but some knows why no
what would be the reasoning behind no
i'm not disagreeing with you i'm asking
your reasons
uh
lousy track record no that's a track
record in different things
the only thing that matters is his track
record at mckinsey
which we think is good right
mckinsey is mostly fraud all right let
me address that the mckinsey model
somebody said is mostly fraud and i
agree
but that's the business that's the model
of consulting that doesn't refer to the
actual consultant
somebody who works for them
is probably not doing anything
fraudulent they're probably just trying
to do their job
but the model is mostly fraudulent
because they're
trying to sell things that
maybe you don't need and
that sort of thing
so yes i think the consulting model is
mostly fraudulent but the consultant is
not necessarily fraudulent just the
business model is
all right
now i will talk about the reasons that
he is not the right person for the job
number one
he did not show good leadership as a
mayor
everybody agree
did not show great leadership as a mayor
i accept that i don't know if it's true
but i'm going to accept it
it's irrelevant
it's irrelevant because he's not being
asked to do the job of a mayor
he's doing that he's being asked to job
do the job of a wonk basically he's
being asked to do the job of a a
technocrat
right as a leader i don't back him yet
i do i do think that he could become one
i actually have high
high hopes for buddha judge maybe
later in his uh career
at the moment i don't think he shows the
leadership skills and i wouldn't defend
his mayor or mayor job so will you
accept
that the job of mayor
he may have done poorly
i don't know but i'm willing to accept
that
but it isn't relevant to the specific
task
all right so that's my first point
secondly uh he's a guy who
went away and did his uh family leave
during the worst part of the worst
problem in the country which was the
supply chain problem
number one
who did he leave in charge
say uh let me let me call out the the
npcs
so felony videos says wow stupidity
scott so that's an npc
let me see if we have any others
uh because i haven't even finished my
points yet
yeah okay that was one
all right um
so all right so what do you think about
the fact that he uh
went on family leave extended two-month
leave during the biggest emergency
here's what we don't know about it
we don't know who is in
charge maybe somebody was in charge and
maybe he was on the phone every day
do you know if he wasn't
does anybody know
if if mayor pete didn't take phone calls
during those two months because i doubt
it
now we do know that he didn't succeed
right
but it's also not exactly his job
can you agree with me there
the transportation secretary isn't
exactly
exactly the right one to fix a port
problem because the port
is sort of a local problem
but i don't think he did enough
however
is that the same problem
so i think he didn't he wasn't
aggressive enough but i also don't know
if he did something or if he could have
made a difference or if it was his
domain
so i would say that's a question mark
and a good one
so if somebody says he didn't do a good
job on the
supply chain i would say
that might be a good point but we also
don't know what he did would you agree
with my point
that you don't know what he did or what
he could have done we don't know that do
we
so i would say that that's a question
but it's also slightly different than
figuring out where to spend
infrastructure money
now the other point is that he's too
woke
because apparently he said something
that sounded ridiculous to almost all of
us which is that the current
infrastructure was built in a racist way
what was your first reaction when you
heard that
maybe some of our roads and bridges were
built in a racist way
you laughed right
you said well now you've gone a little
too far because i don't think we have
racist roads
and i don't think we have racist bridges
right
how many of you have that immediate
reaction
and then after you have that reaction
how many of you actually researched it
to find out he was right
didn't anybody
did anybody research it
because turns out he's right
he's right
apparently it's a it's a known
historical fact
that at least in i know um some parts of
uh new york
that uh there was an actual racist who
designed the roads and didn't give good
roads
where there were a lot of black people
because he didn't want him to use the
roads to go to the park and ruin
everything what
yeah that's a real thing
that apparently a lot of the highways
were designed by actual racists who
actually were making them degraded in
some places
to keep
black people from going where white
people wanted to be
that's actually real apparently
there's plenty we have the name of the
person you know it's their books written
about it i've never heard of that
now i don't know how relevant it is to
today
because i'm pretty sure today we would
just look at wherever it makes sense and
you know and do it there
but
the fact that he raised this and i
didn't know it
uh that's a plus for him
i'd say that's a plus
because he raised an issue um that
i think you could call this uh
systemic racism
apparently it's real
and apparently it probably made a
difference
so i i'm going to give him credit for
that i know some of you are calling
calling that a negative because you
think he's going to do a bunch of woke
investing but i suspect the number of
places where that's actually going to
make a difference
um
is probably small
so here's my argument
he's not being asked to do the job of
the mayor i don't know that he would do
that well he's not being asked to do the
job of a president i don't know that
he'd do that well
he's not being asked to i don't think he
was exactly the right person for the
supply chain problem maybe that just
wasn't the right job
and we don't know what he did or didn't
do when he was on leave but his talent
stack is exactly the right one
for deciding how to spend infrastructure
money now
how many of you can handle
that opinion
can you handle that
that there's definitely some negatives
and i called them out
all right good all right most of you
most of you are good with that
um
and i think i gotta run in a minute
let's see what else i got going oh my
god here's what
i told you about sam altman he was the
president of y combinator i didn't
realize he's now
working for the open ai so he's working
on ai more than that
um he's putting 375 million of his own
money
of his own money into uh this fusion
startup called hellyon
uh 500 million in total but he's putting
375 million of his own so i i i checked
his uh net worth
sam altman's net worth and i thought wow
how what is your net worth
if you can put 375 million into one
thing that might not even work
and it said his net worth was 200
million
i did my own research
a lot of you would just guess but i did
my own research
and according to my research he's worth
200 million
and he's putting 375 million into one
investment
so
it's a good thing i did my own research
because otherwise i wouldn't know any of
this
no he's obviously worth a few billion i
don't know how many billions it is but
this is a gigantic investment and it
shows the person closest to it and the
person who maybe one of the few people
on the planet
who could really predict whether
a startup has what it takes
he would be one of them
yeah i wouldn't trust too many people on
the whole planet to tell me a startup is
looks good but he would be one of them
right of the you know 10 people in the
world who might be the best at this very
thing
so that is really good at the same time
rolls-royce is going to be building
small nuclear reactors of the
traditional kind i think that's a really
big deal and regeneron found out that
regeneron not only helps you solve covid
if you've got it
but can give you lasting immunity well a
sort of immunity for months eight up to
eight months after you take it
uh i also recently invested in regeneron
before i heard this news
so consider my bias but
apparently we have lots of therapeutics
now so the mandates
are a little less ethical than they've
ever been every time we get a new
therapeutic online the argument for
mandates
starts dissolving
and that is my awesome show for today i
think you'll love it
it'll sink in a little bit and get
better as you go all right um
gotta run and i wish
