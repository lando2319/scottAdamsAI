good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams because
that's what we're going to do and if
you'd like to take this situation up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their human little brains all you
need is a cuper muger glass a tanker
jalous with Stein a canteen juger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure of
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called
the simultaneous Sip and happens
[Music]
now it's going to be way better if I put
on my
microphone I I have a trick for
remembering to put on my
microphone what I what I do is I leave
it in the middle of
my working surface so that there's no
way in the world that I could not notice
that it's on and then as soon as I get
my printed
notes uh I I go to put them down and the
microphone's in the way so I move it out
of the
way and then later you say why can't we
hear you CU my trick to
remember doesn't work doesn't work at
all I need a new
trick well there a bunch of interesting
things I'll just go over them quickly
there's a new discovery using radar that
there was some Ancient
Waterway that snaked from the Nile to
where the pyramids
are and you can't see any signs of these
ancient waterways but apparently they
were massive so that might be the big
explanation of why the pyramids are
where they are because they had massive
waterways to transport all the materials
and stuff that they needed Now isn't
that
interesting to think that the pyam pids
were right next to a big tributary of
the
Nile and that once the Nile once that
tributary dried up we had no idea like
how they got those rocks might have been
the answer I guess you already knew that
one I saw Andrew hubman clip in which he
had some guests saying that your
dopamine resets in 30
days so if there's something you're
addicted to if you can stay off it for
30 days your dopamine will get back back
to uh where you want it so in other
words if you can if you can keep off
something for 30 days you'll start to
not miss it now I added my own
experience which is when it comes to
food uh my experience is it takes about
60 days because there's not just your
body that has to get acclimated to the
dopamine but also your brain because you
often have a habit so you're dealing
with an addiction and and a habit at the
same time maybe the dopamine goes back
after 30 days but the brain part where
you got to reach for that thing in my
case it was Diet Cokes you know your
your brain just wants to do a Diet Coke
after let's say after you exercise or
something you know my my normal triggers
so 60 days to get rid of your
habits as well as your dopamine
deficiency and that's why when I give
diet advice I give it like a hypnotist
not like a nutritionist so what I tell
you is uh don't try to quit uh don't try
to quit the quantity of food you eat at
the same time you're trying to get up
give up an addictive food so for example
uh you should just try to quit one bad
food at a time while while not making
any changes to the volume you eat
because if you change the volume you're
eating you've You' got hunger at the
moment you're dealing with you've got a
habit you're dealing with and maybe an
addiction so you've given yourself three
problems you can get rid of one of them
by just not being hungry eat as much as
you want but make sure that you lose
your craving for this one that's extra
bad and then when that craving is gone
two months later you pick another one
now if you did that every two months for
one year imagine you could reduce these
six biggest problem foods without really
much of an effort because you would
never be hungry and you'd always be
eating things you liked all the time so
that that's my my
uh my suggestion is never let yourself
be hungry while you're dieting just
change the mix of things you're eating
all
right but do them one at a time don't
don't get don't get rid of all your
addictions at the same time so even
getting rid of sugar all at once is
tough but getting rid of that you know
ice cream you eat before you go to sleep
you know just work on that and then if
you can get that one after two months
maybe work on you know dessert after
dinner and then just that one so that'll
work for you believe
me all right uh I was asked on X uh if
hypnosis could be used for breaking
addictions such as drinking and drugs
and the answer is is I'll give you the
answer that my hypnosis teacher taught
me which has basically changed my
life you know you've heard this in
another context but in the hypnosis
context is really strong uh my hypnosis
instructor taught me this which I've
seen to be true my entire life that when
somebody has decided to quit their
addiction drinking drugs food smoking
whatever it is when they've decided to
quit it doesn't matter what method they
use they could use hypnosis and it would
work totally would work they could use
uh reading a book that gives them some
tips totally would work they could say
oh I did it my way I went to a desert
island that would work it all works once
you've
decided everything works and but you
might want to do something in other
words don't do nothing it probably helps
that you pick some method you're
comfortable with but but the flip side
of that is when you only want to quit no
method works let me say that again when
you want to quit your addiction but it's
not a decision it's just something you
really want no method
works let me say that like five more
times if you haven't decided to quit you
just want it no method Works no method
Works no method Works no method
works that's that's the thing you have
to get right is that
decision all right
raspon uh had a poll of Arkansas voters
and what they think about paper ballots
versus
machines and by 2 to one the Arkansas
people wanted paper ballots but here's
the weird part the 31% opposed having
only handmark ballots in other words 31%
of people in Arkansas prefer
machines
um
why does anybody have any reason have
you ever heard of any
reason I've never heard one because it's
it's not a reason that you can't do it
in time that's just a Manpower or human
power thing right there's no problem
about getting done in time uh 100% of
experts would
agree that you can have a a fair and
secure and well- audited
election 100% of experts would agree
that adding a complicated new technology
could give you problems on voting day of
course but also questions about what's
happening within the machine if people
can't tell so there's a a public
perception problem so even if the
machines are
perfect the the public has trouble
telling it's there's an audit problem
so
I I just can't understand how in the
world nearly a third of people in
Arkansa you know especially a republican
kind of state what argument do they have
for not having paper ballots and also
having electronic machines what have you
ever heard an have you ever heard the
argument machines with a time stamp but
still machines introduce an extra level
of complic apption
right lots of Democrats but do you think
it's let me ask you this do you think
it's because 30% are uninformed about
the advantages and
disadvantages is that all it is they're
just
uninformed
probably all right um so you know this
whole Seth Rich thing is bubbling up
again because I
guess through some Freedom of
Information Act uh we'll soon have
access to what his laptop said now I
don't expect anything interesting to
come of
that um according to a thing called the
news uh the idea that Seth Rich had been
giving stuff
to uh Wikileaks and that therefore
that's why he got killed that that came
literally from a Russian
disinformation that's the first time I
heard
that and that uh the story is that was
Russian disinformation and
hanity uh Shan hanity on Fox is the
primary one who turned it into a
thing and that there was never anything
to
it how many of you think that that's a
true a true statement of what happened
that there's no evidence anywhere
there's no document there's no testimony
no evidence that Wikileaks ever got
anything from Seth
rich don't believe
it well I I'll tell you where I'm
at um this is this is not one I'd be
inclined to believe I'm not inclined to
believe it but we do live in a world
where most of the conspiracy theories
have turned out to be real you know
maybe like 55% of them or
something
so it's sort of squarely in the category
of anything's possible isn't it yeah
just sort of anything's
possible I don't know um but I'd love to
see Hannity respond to the claim that
the entire thing was based on one uh
Russian known known Russian
disinformation because there was a fake
document that they say they chased to
Russia it doesn't exactly
sound like you could believe either side
of this yeah there there's a lot of lack
of credibility in this story
well Gallup has a poll about uh how
independent voters are thinking about uh
Biden uh I'm going to ask you to see if
you can guess uh if the independent
voters what what percent do you think uh
did not think that Biden's ruining the
economy very good guess yeah about a
quarter about a quarter that's correct
all right how many of The Independents
thought he's doing a pretty good job in
the Middle East in the M oh right again
25% yeah it's right around
25% um how about uh what percentage of
the public thinks he's doing good in
foreign affairs in general foreign
affairs in general well how do you keep
doing this you're right again yeah 28%
but you're very very close very close
wow you are the smartest audience I've
ever
seen and and it should be noted that
many of you had the right answers before
I asked the question that's something
you're not going to see on Alex Jones no
no only
here can Steven Crowder have people get
the right answer before he asks the
question I don't think so that's only
here
anyway um so James comr in the uh house
committee
oversight uh group he released an email
he says that the uh B bank money
laundering investigator so there was a a
bank employee who is an investigator for
looking into you know allegations of
money laundering within their
Bank uh he raised concerns back in
2018 about unusual Financial activity
from China going into the Biden
accounts um now apparently the
government has known about this and at
least a bank has known about it I'm sure
it was
reported um since
2018 basically everybody knew since 2018
when I say everybody I mean everybody
who mattered in the the Deep state
government situation
now would you say
that Biden is staying in power because
he thinks he's the best candidate for
the
job I don't think so so do you think
it's because he's got plenty of energy
left and he thinks that his health is
perfect and or at least good enough and
uh there's no real problem and he beat
Trump before so it just makes
sense
no nobody believes that no so why is he
staying in office is it because they
don't have a good
backup no not really CU they have at
least people who can walk and talk and
stand upright of course they have better
candidates of course they do
now I've got I think I've narrowed it
down to two
possibilities and maybe it's both number
one is that he's the most black mailable
president we've had in a long time
although I suspect they all are um and
that that he's being blackmailed by some
members of the intelligence Community or
something just so that they'll let him
stay alive and out in jail so it's it's
the ideal situation if you're the an
intelligence branch of a of a government
to have the most black mailable person
as the leader you you can't you can't do
better than that if you're the head of
the intelligence
agencies um but on top of that he's got
to stay in power to uh stay in a jail
not just from the blackmail but he's got
to keep his pardon abilities and he's
got to keep his ability to prevent
people from investing ating
carefully because you they might fear
that if he's in office again he'll get
retribution so they can't go hard at any
of his
family so how in the world could he
win when you no doubt have somebody like
Trump who would say this thing these
things out
loud you know where's the part where
Trump says what I said let's be serious
people you know he's not running because
he believes he's healthy enough you all
know that Jill knows it the public knows
it so it's not because he's healthy
enough to do the
job it's not because he's the only good
candidate the Democrats can muster
they've got some solid candidates I mean
they could they
could so I think that Trump could say
this directly or you know vake or
anybody who's running could just say
you've sort of narrowed it down to
you're either blackmailed or you're just
trying to stay in a jail and that's kind
of the whole story now it is kind of a
point in time which is weird that you
could make the same argument about
Trump that he needs to win to make sure
he stays out of jail because that's
probably true so we have two
presidential candidates who are probably
going to run against each other if the
polls are correct primarily to stay on
the
jail now Trump has also a Revenge motive
and he's Trump and he likes to win and
he wants the country to do well so he
has lots of motives but one of them all
bet all bet one of them is staying out
of jail you know top
five so good work
America the American system got us to
hear that's where we ended up great
job all right um if I ever get murdered
I don't want it to be in ironic kind of
way that people do a story because it
was kind of
funny you know tragic tragic of course
but sometimes funny for
example if I were uh murdered by a
talking
dog you know I do a comic where there's
a talking dog well that would be in the
news for sure I mean I suppose I'd be
newsworthy either way but I don't want
the story to be how funny it is the way
I died it can't be ironic I just want to
go some natural way I don't want to be
like this La social justice Advocate who
is killed when a homeless woman broke
into his home and filled him with
bullets so uh jamaa Elena me Mel is the
suspect went into his home and shot him
to
death so that's who he was that's the uh
the homeless Community is who he was
trying to
help um if only there had been some way
to avoid this if only what could he have
done
differently I don't know can't thing uh
Jen Jen Jen
wiger uh he's running for the nomination
to be the Democrat running for president
and he's saying uh he's choosing to run
to keep out all other Maj well he's
keeping out other Challengers at a time
when 3/4s of the country didn't want him
to
run and uh Jen says it will be seen if
if Biden stays in and he loses he'll be
seen as one of the most selfish acts in
American history he's practically
handing the country over to
Trump well he's right but what is behind
the
selfishness I don't think the
selfishness is he he wants to be a
two-term
President Biden might be the first
legitimate president who said you know
one term is fine I don't know if anybody
ever said that but he might be the only
person who ever
legitimately expected to and wanted to
have one term might be the only one
because of his age I think he still
wishes he had one
term that's my assumption based on
observation of his health and his
performance but can't read his mind so
you never
know I guess the US set a new record
with 15% of our current population is
made up of immigrants 4.5 million new
immigrants settled since Biden took
office um and there are now almost 50
million immigrants both legal and
illegal residing in the country does
that sound like bad news to
you what's your like does your brain
translate that into bad
news cuz I feel like there's some bias
in that if you are
I mean like a lot of
bias like we we would have a far fewer
uh gigantic corporations in America like
Google and you know things like that if
we didn't have this many
immigrants do you do you think that the
net of 50 million immigrants do you
think the net net is
negative does anybody think that
yes okay that's crazy that's
crazy most of these are legal immigrants
who had the wherewithal to get to
America because they wanted to work in
this system are you kidding me let let
me say this
unambiguously 50 million immigrants in
the United States is financial
gold that's Financial gold now now hold
on if if you're shocked by that it's
because you're confusing the
troublemakers with the average don't
cons don't confuse the
troublemakers with the
average that the quality of immigrants
to the United States is probably
unparalleled you know even with as much
trouble as we have with the illegal
Crossings if you're looking at the whole
picture oh my god do we get good
immigrants we get really good IM
immigrants in general now at the moment
we've got a a quality problem because
we're not vetting anybody they're just
running over that's different and and I
would Grant you if all 50 million just
ran across the border from every part of
the world you don't know which way that
goes but given that most of the most of
the immigrants came under some kind of a
system where you know you had to be
adding something to the to the
economy you you you need to get this
stra this is something you need to get
right the United States has a declining
population we would be dead without
immigrants it's the difference between
thriving and just being
dead so I'm saying people disagree with
that if you're disagreeing with that
you're completely off base yeah that's
not this is not a matter of opinion this
is not a matter of
opinion I I believe 100% of economists
would agree
100% find me one Economist who disagrees
with me and not about illegal
immigration but about the 50 million you
will not find one Economist left or
right who
disagrees I don't think right now again
I everybody who's disagree with me
you're having the same problem you're
you're imagining that the the troubling
group is somehow representative it's not
not even close
all
right
um kamla was uh at some event with uh
we'll talk about this event with uh
what's his name Andrew Ross
sorin uh deal book I guess is the event
and Harris was asked by
sorin uh to talk about Tik Tock you know
specifically it's danger to the United
States and she she treaded water for two
minutes to talk about compl completely
other things and then when he got her
back to Tik Tock she said she didn't
want to talk about
it that's the vice president of the
United States talking about one of the
existential threats to the country no
doubt about it which is that China can
push the heat button on anything they
want and she's like I don't want to talk
about
it wow and her family members use it of
course of course well the Gaza ceasefire
has been extended another day what does
it all mean what does it mean does it
mean there's going to be a permanent
ceasefire I doubt it uh Netanyahu is
saying as clearly as possible today no
Hamas will be completely
destroyed whatever we do between now and
then don't be confused it won't look
like I'm paraphrasing but it's not going
to look like a
ceasefire whatever we do it ends with
killing everybody in Hamas who was a bad
guy so I think you know delaying for
another day if they give some more
prisoners back probably a
win the thing I don't understand is I I
keep hearing people say that Hamas will
rearm themselves because of the
ceasefire where would they get these
arms is it because they could more
easily get to a different tunnel where
there's some arms because I doubt
they're running out of arms aren't the
tunnels just full of ammo and
arms I know I it seems to me that
they've got that area pretty buttoned up
nobody gets in around I don't know how
they were going to get any extra arms
from the outside so unless they had some
way to you know repurpose them on the
inside I don't know that it would make
any
difference so that's just an open
question did you see the uh viral uh
thing that happened with Northface the
maker of Outdoors clothing there was
some viral Tik Tock uh an attractive
woman who's must have had a big social
media presence I don't know who it was
but she was uh up hiking in some remote
part of Australia and it was raining and
she was wearing a North Face made uh
rain or jacket that she I guess she
thought might have been a little
waterproof but it wasn't so she was
complaining in this remote Mountain
where there's just nobody else like all
by herself up on this mountain and she's
just water logged and wet and she's
complaining into her her phone and she
tells Northface that she wants them to
bring her bring her a new jacket at the
top of the
mountain so
Northface magnificent bastards that they
are immediately leapt into action and
managed to get this quick film they did
this so quickly that she was still in
the
mountain right they they rented a
helicopter they got a uh film crew I
guess and they got a guy that they
filmed running into the store grabbing a
jacket uh running onto a helicopter you
see the helicopter find her on the
mountain she's really the she really was
the only one there and it was easy to
find her wasn't there wasn't much in
trees or anything it was kind of open
land they see her the elevator the
helicopter pulls down next to her and
this is this is the funnier part
the the guy with the coat uh gets out
and he runs over to her and she she acts
like she knows what's happening at this
point and instead of talking to her he
throws the coat at her he just throws it
at her and she catches it and he turns
and immediately runs back to the
helicopter and goes away now how many of
you think it was
planned little little bit too
good little bit too good yeah
I'm going to
say it it's not impossible that it was
organic it's not
impossible but the timing doesn't make
any sense at all does it have you ever
tried to rent a
helicopter can can you get your
helicopter rented in it in an
hour got your film crew and then they
found her on the
mountain yeah it was still funny
so whether it was planned or wasn't
planned I I would still give North Face
and a triple Plus for marketing it was
kind of amazing yeah even if it was
planned it was amazing I I don't mind I
don't mind if it was planned if it was
just a marketing stunt I'm okay with
that it entertained
me well the big
story is that uh Elon Musk was at that
same event I mentioned that dealbook
thing talking to and Drew Ross sorin and
when asked about the advertisers who are
leaving the xplatform because of his
alleged
anti-semitic comments which were of
course not anti-semitic that's the way
these things work um and he said about
them don't advertise is someone is
trying to Blackmail with me with
advertising uh blackmailed me with
money go yourself go yourself
is that clear I hope it
is now I only had one word response for
that
Legend yeah and then he said hi Bob
talking to Bob Iger of Disney who might
have been in the
audience
so I don't know I don't think I could
love this any more than I do I do I do
love the fact as was pointed out to me
by uh user Blackjack fing on X who said
calling the people leaving uh
blackmailers is a genius reframe and he
mentioned my book you know my
book reframe your
brain yes it's about reframes but that's
what uh Elon
did if you if you allow their frame hey
you said something anti-em so they left
you lose because then you're arguing
from within their frame no I didn't do
it I didn't do it well you're in the
frame no but I didn't do it never works
you have to change the whole frame which
he did he changed it to
Blackmail does that does it ring does it
ring true when you hear
blackmail does your brain say that
wasn't blackmail or does your brain say
you know what that was pretty black Mish
you know what mine does so mine mine
grabbed blackmail just like it owned me
now that's a good reframe and then what
did he do to sell the
reframe he uh he pissed on your
tablecloth he used terrible squar words
in a situation where you should not use
terrible swear words knowing of of
course that it would be
viral so not only did he reframe
it but then he lit a nuclear bomb under
the
reframe so you're not going to miss
it not only that but he did it in such a
way let let me ask you this let me ask
you in the comments you tell me how many
in the
comments have now quoted him either
talking to a friend or in your mind you
repeated it or you retweeted it how many
have quoted him
already a lot right the news people do
right a
lot if I've taught you anything about
Ai and the fact that they use these
large language models to create some
kind of
intelligence um that's kind of what he's
doing he he just drew your attention to
it in a way you couldn't miss it he said
something interesting so you repeated
his words in your mind what happens if
you can get somebody to repeat your
words in their minds it it reprograms
them so he actually reprogrammed half of
Earth by doing that that if if you think
that was just I I think the news is
reporting it as like an epic
meltdown that was the opposite of an
epic meltdown that was a pers persuasion
play that
had the best persuasion technique I
you'll ever see you you can't beat
that you you had the provocation by
doing something on of context he did it
in a public way he got all that
attention now what do I tell you is are
the two
strongest um
persuasion elements the two strongest
parts of persuasion
are What Fear
correct and fear and visual yeah the
visual part of your brain now attention
is necessary for all all persuasion so
if you set attention that was you get
credit for that but if you can give fear
and a visual
thing he didn't say
you you would have been bad
persuasion he told Bob ier a person that
you can personally if if you know
business if you follow business at all
you can picture him and he didn't he
didn't say you he said go
yourself I literally see Bob Iger trying
to get his dick in his
mouth can you beat
that no no you cannot beat that that
that's visual persuasion even in a
verbal sense so verbally he painted you
a picture and he painted you a picture
that's a physical
impossibility was that a mistake because
it's a physical
impossibility no that's
technique because the physical
impossibility is what makes you think
about it so long you're like well you
can't really well suppose you okay if
you took enough yoga No but if he were
built if he were really well hung
if you know if you if you count
anal you know so it makes it makes you
think about it and it makes you think
about it
visually you you just can't get better
that and then as far as
fear when he says blackmailed even
though he's being blackmailed not you
you can feel
it I could feel
that because you could put yourself in
this position and you're thinking really
you you're going to Blackmail this guy
and and my favorite part was he didn't
have to say on the richest man on
earth didn't need to say it he just said
you're going to try to Blackmail me with
money that that to me that was the that
was the kill shot with
money because you know what that was
designed to do the way he framed that
you know what that was designed to
do make them feel
hopeless do you think I'm going to stop
funding this because you're with
me I'm still the richest man in the
world I can keep this alive as long as I
want yeah with
money are you
serious so if you want somebody to
eventually change their mind you want to
make sure that they know it's hopeless
and they're going to look like turds
until they Chang their
mind apparently there have been
substantial cancellations of the Disney
app since he said
that
yeah yeah Disney's going Disney's going
to go full uh you know full on Bud
Light because he basically Elon just he
just sounded the the attack didn't
he it's one thing when Dan santis goes
after Disney honestly I didn't really
care about any of
that you know it was good good politics
I suppose but I didn't really love the
the Disney Dan santis fight wasn't a big
fan of that but this is kind of this
this is a different level this is a this
is about Free Speech itself the survival
of free speech I do think it's that it's
that
important so I don't think uh musk could
have done much better than that and then
on a separate topic he said that
uh uh he's done more for the environment
than anybody on
Earth is that good persuasion you done
more for the environment than any single
person on
Earth
yes it's perfect do you know what is bad
persuasion I've done a lot for the
environment I've done a lot for the
environment I've done many things I will
list them bad persuasion do you know why
oh everybody thinks you know I
recycle yeah okay great I
recycle yeah we all do self fore the
environment you you're a bigger bigger
entity so of course it adds up more but
we're all doing our part you there was
that time I walked when I could have
driven we're all doing our thing yeah
big deal you do lots of things for the
but when he says I'm the singest single
biggest contributor to the to the
environment in the history of planet
Earth you just have to stop and say all
right is
he is he and then you think well there's
Greta but she hasn't really physically
done anything she's just convincing
people yeah so if you get into an
argument with yourself about whether
he's really the number one or would it
be more appropriate to say he's only in
the top five if he can make you argue
whether whether he's the number one or
well just in the top five he wins he
wins cuz then it's not you saying well I
recycle too it's a big
deal all right but here's my favorite
story which is unrelated but related uh
there are claims now that uh Elon musk's
uh rockets for SpaceX are putting holes
in
space does it sound like made that
up there there's actually there's a
sciency explanation to
it but
literally
literally the simple explanation is his
Rockets are putting holes in
space does it sound to you like maybe
there are powerful entities who have
decided to take Elon Musk out are you
seeing any
signs that maybe there's a coordinated
attack is rocket are putting holes in
space come on come
on uh then the other thing must
said which I I took to be a comment
about the ADL and people who act the
same I guess uh uh I am saying what I
care about is the reality of goodness
not the perception of it and what I see
all over the place is people who care
about looking good while doing evil
them okay
now I think that would include
ESG probably includes the
WF might include the who yeah might
include Democrats in general I don't
know but he's got a
point it is really annoying that the
people who are the most
evil uh are the ones trying to convince
you that they're the the
Angels good point on
that all right
um did any of you have trouble
understanding why musk was in trouble
for commenting positively on the
Tweet um did anybody look at the tweet
that got him in trouble and read it and
then reread it and say I'm not sure what
the problem
is and here's what it looks like it
looks like it's the standard play that
goes like this you pretend you don't
know what he says and then you never you
never leave that frame you just pretend
you don't understand what he really
meant but of course you do let let me
read I'll remind you what it was and
then I'll show you how they pretend
they're they're reading it wrong okay uh
so this is uh the original poster I
don't know who it
was
um said something
quote
um the Jewish communities have been
pushing the exact kind of dialectical
hatred against whites that they claim to
want people to stop using against them
the post read and then it went on I'm
deeply disinterested in giving the
tiniest now about Western Jewish
populations coming to the disturbing
realization that those hordes of
minorities that support flooding their
country don't exactly like them too
much uh and then mus replied you have
the actual truth you have said the
actual truth now what would make this
super bigoted and racist is if he said
that Jews in general are doing whatever
this
is is that how you heard
it when you read this did you think he
meant all
Jews no you know why you didn't think it
meant all Jews CU nobody ever means that
about any group if you say uh black
people have a high crime rate you're
never talking about all black people
that's what rap means right you're not
talking about all of them if you say uh
elbonian uh like to wear hats are you
ever talking about all elbonian never
never everybody knows that if you say uh
black people like hip-hop
music do you mean every every black
person likes hip-hop never never of
course you don't mean that and any body
who heard you would know that you did
not mean that so when this tweet said
Jewish communities in the
west do you think there's any chance
that he intended to mean every Jew in
America no we all know that do you think
that he included now I guess the ratio I
looked it up this morning uh s out of 10
American Jews are Democrats
70% do you think that Elon was including
the 30% of conservative Jews who might
be in favor of building a wall on our
border do you think he was saying bad
things about that group
no so of course not like obviously of
course not because that would be a group
a group that largely agrees with
Elon right so why why would he be
criticizing the people who have the same
opinion he has it's obviously not about
Jewish people in general
it's obviously about individual groups
like you know maybe he was thinking of
the ADL maybe he was thinking of
Democrats maybe he was thinking of
Soros but to me it was a comment about
Democrats so when I read it I go oh he's
talking about Democrats who want open
borders and that includes a lot of
Jewish folks but it's not really about
being Jewish it's about being in the
group of people who like the open
borders which which would include a lot
of every type of person you got your
Christians you got your blacks your
whites your everything
so here here's the thing you need to
know there's nobody who believes he said
anything
anti-semitic you get that right none of
his critics believe he said anything
anti-semitic none of them they all know
what they're doing they know that they
if they intentionally pretend he did
they can keep saying it because people
don't go back to the source and you know
read it and do what I'm doing nobody
thinks he did nobody not a single person
believes he meant all Jews not
one all all
right uh so it it's obviously a
political statement but once it's out of
the bag nothing you could do about it
now you should see this technique in
lots of other places don't you how often
do you see the oh he must be talking
about every single person and you know
they're not
ever all right uh speaking of
Disney uh apparently in their uh
Financial reports they're acknowledging
that they're too woke and it's costing
them money but they say it in big
Corporate Way do you want to hear the
big Corporate Way you say uhoh we went
to woke and we ruined all our products
and everybody hates us here's the
corporate way to say it in
public quote we risks relating to
misalignment with public and consumer
tastes and preferences for entertainment
travel and consumer
products yes we're we're not aligned
with the with the
customers how about our products are
 because we bowed to the woke people
on the
left now when I say they bowed to the
woke people on the left here's a test
this will be a test did I mean every
Democrat did that refer to 100% of
Democrats of course not of
course
not and and everyone of you understood
right did did I need to say you know a
lot of them or many of them or too many
of them or there there too many of them
in that group no no no because since
you're not trying to kill me and remove
me from on my you know platform you just
hear it the way I mean it but if you
were here to deplatform me you would say
oh you saying every Democrat how how
ridiculous of you to say every
democrat's like
that all right uh Henry Kissinger is
dead people have different opinions
about him and I would ask you the
following
question if you think you can evaluate
Henry
Kissinger you know based on the
historical record
how are you going to uh how are they
going to write the history of the Trump
administration because someday that's
going to have to be in a history book
and how will they write the history of
Gaza and you know the last month or
two just think about that who who's
going to write that history and when
it's written would you believe it cuz
there's certainly going to be an Israeli
version of history there certainly
already is you know a version for the
Palestinians so which one is
history it depends right so if a
Democrat wrote a biography of Henry
Kissinger do you think that would be you
know nice and clean and unbiased versus
let's say a staun republican wrote a
biography of Kissinger do you think it'd
be different
of course it
would so um people were asking me all
day yesterday because Kissinger died at
age 100 they were saying you know give
us your opinion of his legacy you know
did he do more good than bad and here's
my answer how would anybody
know it's completely unknowable there
might be things that if I looked at I
would say oh I don't like that there
might be things I'd look at and say hm
by today's perspective that seems very
unwoke maybe but if you're telling me
I'm G to try to figure out whether
Kissinger was mostly good or mostly bad
you know what what's sort of the average
you don't
know there's literally no way to know
it's
unknowable because you would be looking
at historical records and things taken
out of context and there's no way you
could piece that together and have a
reasonable opinion no
way yeah so I mean
you could have an opinion and a sense of
things but if you have a high level of
confidence in that opinion I think that
would be unwarranted so I would say he's
probably somebody who did some good
stuff and some bad stuff and I have no
idea how it Nets
out well peteran has uh declared he's
going to leave the
xplatform uh because he said what was
once a platform where you could access
open- Source information that was
reliable and free has now been laid to
rest by Elon Musk yes I'm talking about
that little blue bird we've known in
love for years now that seems to be
pretty close to the opposite of my
experience I would say the x is way
better and the the the singular place
where there's still free speech and
everybody can have their say now why
would his why would his opinion be the
polar opposite of my experience and by
the way
tell me who you agree with would you
agree that it's like so bad now you
should leave or do you agree with me
that it's not only better than it's ever
been but you know it's the
jewel in the constitutional
republic at the moment
yeah now many of you said to me Scott
Scott Scott stop talking about this
Peter Zan guy and his views about China
and Ukraine because it seemed to knew
that he was some kind of a
intelligence plant that he was just
working for the CIA you said now I don't
know about any of that I don't know
about any of that I have I have no no
data nothing that would say that I do
know he acts exactly like that or
exactly like what I would expect to see
if you were primarily a CIA asset and I
don't think that any honest person would
say what he said said which is that the
platform is going to hell and you can't
good get good information anymore I
don't believe he really believes that
now I can't read his mind right so if
you're going to say hey you're reading
Minds I'd say well okay you got me there
but here's why I think it I can't know
for sure here's why I think it I think
it because nobody would have this
opinion nobody would have this opinion
this is not I mean it's just sort of
sort of on its surface it's obvious
ridiculous so to me it looks like it's
just um yes some
Alliance that he's he's satisfying with
this I don't know who it would be but so
I'm not going to make any accusations
about who he really works for I'll just
note that a lot of people have that view
and that um my observation is I can't
think of a second way to explain it I
don't know a second way to explain this
observation so
uh here's an interesting update on open
Ai and um chat GPT so another uh we've
got a resignation by another board
member Helen toner and she said this on
X about her resignation to be clear our
decision was about the board's ability
to
effectively supervise the company which
was our role and
responsibility um there there's been the
speculation we were not motivated by a
desire to slow down oh there's been
speculation but we were not motivated by
desire to slow down open AI so the the
primary story that we all got about the
Sam mman situation and I think I think
it was reported in every
Outlet was that the reason for the
conflict was that the board wanted to go
slower and Alman wanted to go faster on
AI and now here's the board member
herself
she's saying unambiguously had nothing
to do with
that now if she didn't tell you
that what would the history of this
situation have
written probably it would have gone with
all the the news reports it would have
written that that was a reason so so you
really think you can evaluate
Kissinger no you cannot evaluate kisser
cuz it's all this and always has
been yeah if if this one if this one
board member had not decided to not only
quit because if she had not quit I don't
think we would ever heard this right it
it seems related to her quitting I I
think she would have kept quiet and you
know maybe be had more decorum as a
board member
but this is really valuable for the the
permanent record so I don't know what
the problem was they've been pretty
unspecific about it all right um if
you're not following Kyle Becker on X
you're really missing out in my opinion
he is in the
top I don't know definitely top 10 maybe
top
five of useful news related um
independent uh journalists probably top
five you know he's in there with
Greenwald and um
shellenberger uh Cano the Great
you those are accounts that are but just
always have the best stuff all right and
it's so good that I want to read you his
very long u post because he summarizes
the January 6
situation um really well and you need to
you need to have it resummed every once
in a while because it's
complicated so um let me just read Kyle
Becker's thing
so he says uh so it turns out there were
quote at least 200 feds and undercover
operatives working the Trump entrapment
plot on January 6 now don't get too
excited about that that's not a verified
fact uh he says his source is that's
according to US Representative clay
Higgins Republican uh who sat down for a
recent
interview uh and said quote the FBI was
not just participating in the January 6
acts from within I sus they had over 200
agents so this was one politician who
suspects right so i' I'd say uh well we
have verification I'm sure that they
were there but 200 would be a whole
different story than 50 would you agree
well 50 might be the same story 200
would be a bit a different story than
20 that would be a different
story all right so there's one person
who thinks that he suspects there were
over 200 so I wouldn't rely on that
number that's just one person's
speculation
um and that they were addressed As Trump
supporters and Etc um now Kyle says
again he's not buying into the number
entirely he says this figure is in the
realm of possibility given the newly
released uh j6 videos court documents
and witness statements uh I would
agree I would agree with it's in the
realm of possibility probably high
but in the realm I mean if it's a 100
would have changed your
mind if you find out there were only 100
and not 200 that wouldn't change your
mind much would it 100's a lot so but
here's the important part
um and when you track this is in quotes
so I guess this must be what uh clay
Higgin said quote and when you track the
text threads and the communications
Within those groups and find the origins
of suggestions of potential violence or
an active occupation of the capital on
January 6 you'll find that those
messages were led by members of the
groups that ended up to be the FBI
agents and had infiltrated the group
hean
said now is that true that we have
enough of a pattern that the the groups
that were
involved at the very least we know that
they had uh they were infiltrated and
that the feds were the ones who made
might have been the provocative ones
which of course is you know not
allowed all right um so Higgins
continued so the FBI's involvement was
deep not just on j6 but on the days and
weeks and months prior all right so we
don't know the exact number but there's
apparently evidence that some number of
them may have been instigators and that
would be the key Point whether the FBI
with the instigators or were would it
have happened
organically um now Kyle says there's now
zero doubt that j6 was a
setup well setup does a lot of work but
um he says the Trump incitement
narrative had been hatched months prior
as the infamous uh Time shadow cabal
article made clear all right so Time
Magazine so Kyle says the j6 riot was
war gamed multiple times before the
Electoral
College wow did you know that it was a
war gam ahead of
time is that in the time article um I
don't know about that all right the FBI
unconstitutionally used NSA surveillance
to track the extremist groups seeking to
disrupt the event they had Federal
informant embedded in multiple extremist
GL groups including the proud
boys now here's here's sort of a payoff
here he says yeah somehow the FBI
Capital police were woefully unprepared
despite multiple Advanced
warnings yeah how how do you have all
these embedded FBI agents who are fully
aware of what January 6 is going to turn
into because they're part of the
organizations that are going to do it
and they don't warn anybody or if they
did warn them they weren't
prepared H that doesn't quite track does
it um he goes
on
uh DC mayor Bowser former speaker Nancy
py former Senator majority Mitch
mconnell and others refused to press for
more National Guard despite it being
documented and on the record that former
president Trump wanted 10,000 National
Guard troops outside Congress to protect
the Electoral College is that an
established fact that's documented that
the asked way out of the Electoral
College for 10,000 and they turned it
down
what else do you need to
know if the
groups that were the aggressive ones had
FBI
informants and we have records that the
FBI informants might have been the ones
riling things
up and then we know that since everybody
knew there would be a problem and Trump
knew it too and he asked for
reinforcements and he was
denied that looks exactly like a setup
doesn't it
what else would it
be I mean even incompetence it would be
tough to stretch this to incompetence
usually I'm going to take the
incompetence argument as the obvious one
oh that people were just dumb because
that explains a lot but this would be a
level of dumb that would be hard to
explain they're not that dumb are
they um Kyle goes on says also there was
no centrally coordinated plot to
overturn the results of the ction as FBI
sources told Reuters in a 2021 uh
report uh that's a big deal and indeed
he says that was the entire point of the
election challenges during the con
convening of the Electoral
College um if Donald Trump wanted to
overturn the 2020 elections he would
have dis he would not have disrupted the
Electoral College he would have
continued to pursue his legal
challenge that makes sense to me
it seems that if you're going to do the
legal challenge that the riot is working
against your own
interests like it's like pick one pick
the riot or pick the the legal you know
the legal way they don't kind of work
together it's a good
point uh Trump would not have sent in
unarmed extremists to Del to to disrupt
Electoral College in order to retain
power uh this is not only illogical is
absurd on its face it is absurd because
at best they could have delayed things a
day and then Supreme Court would have
worked it out and literally nothing
would have
happened
[Music]
um so nonetheless this ridiculous
partisan narrative has constituted the
basis for prosecuting a former president
and what is devolved into a partisan
show
trial
yeah
I don't know so you know there there's
still some questions about the number of
feds but if people are guessing 200 it
wasn't
five right it wasn't
five I'm going to put my own guess on it
we'll probably never know I'm going to
put my own guess on it
at between 30 and
50 between 30 and
50 just a guess based on living in the
world and how hard it is to get anything
done and that sort of thing and they
probably would have thought that was
enough so some of you are guessing 100
200 seems High I mean if it's
200 that would explain
everything all
right
um yeah and then we have the governor
Whitmer situation to tell us that things
can get under of control with the under
recover assets so we know that's a
thing uh is a claim that feds are
responsible for January
6 uh that's that would be the current
claim but I don't know that uh I don't
think that Trump had enough proof of
that to make it part of the court
case but um remember the standard for
government is guilty until proven
innocent the standard for Citizens is
the opposite we're innocent till proven
guilty so if you have uh if you have
allegations about the number of
feds and they they're not forthcoming
about the number you should assume
they're
guilty not because it's necessarily
guaranteed to be true but it's the only
smart way to play
it if the government won't tell you what
they're doing assume it's corrupt every
time right in the in the great unlikely
chance that something else is happening
okay you got wrong that time but you're
going to be right nine out of 10 times
if you assume that when they're hiding
stuff there's a good reason they're
hiding it and it's not a reason you
like so yes the mere fact that the FBI
will not disclose how many agents were
involved I I consider a proof of
crime in in a logical sense sense but
not a legal sense logically it's
proof because and again make the
distinction if it were you as an
individual that's not proof you're going
to have to prove I did it but when the
government says we're not going to tell
you this valuable information that you
want to know and by the way we can't
even tell you that there's a reason we
can't tell
you
right because suppose they said uh yes
the number is 200 but we don't want to
tell you how many are embedded in the
groups and how many were just working
that
day that's not good enough because they
don't have to tell us that they could
just say they're about 200 but we don't
want to give you the breakdown of you
know what they were
doing that would be something and and at
least then I would understand the part
where they don't want to tell us
something it's like okay you don't want
to tell us how many people are embedded
because that would you know maybe alarm
those groups I get that but not telling
us any number even even a
generality no that's proof of
guilt now again doesn't mean they're
guilty but it should be considered proof
the same way that we can you know
convict somebody an individual for a
crime if you convict somebody of a crime
and you say they're guilty you
understand that doesn't mean they did
the crime right that just means that the
process found I'm guilty that's
different from whether they actually did
it likewise uh I am Prosecuting the FBI
right now by saying your failure to give
us this information I consider proof of
guilt does that mean they're guilty 100%
nope nope could be some weird thing that
we don't know about but you have to
treat it like they're guilty the same
way if somebody is convicted even if
they're not guilty you know in reality
they're still going to put him in jail
and treat him that way because you have
to you have a working assumption that's
the only way you can go through life
well I don't know for sure but my
working assumption is this so it bothers
me no end when we treat January 6 like a
maybe it's a maybe cuz we don't know but
we shouldn't treat it that way you
should treat it like a a confirmed guilt
by government hiding information that
you have no reason to know why it should
be
hidden
yeah all right
um doesn't the mil war game against such
CS well since it wasn't a coup I don't
know um yeah and then there might be a
question about how many are actually
FBI employees and how much are
informance
whatever oh
wow all right that's all I got for
now ladies and gentlemen one of the
finest live streams you'll ever
