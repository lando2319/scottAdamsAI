before i i start this thing
because there are like 12 things i have
to do before i can get these two live
streams going
one of those 12 things
i forgot to do
which is printing out my notes which is
going to happen right now
while you watch
all right
and while we're printing this
let me tell you about uh last night
so
i'm i'm loving watching how
businesses are conforming to the whole
mask mandate stuff
and
had this uh had this experience
i went out to eat last night
i remembered to bring my mask
which is useful only talking to the
hostess and then as soon as you sit down
you take it off
so it's really just a sort of
play-acting mask situation
and but
christina forgot her mask
so christina walks in without a mask
i walk in with a mask and i think to
myself
what are the odds that the restaurant is
going to make her go away
because she doesn't have a mask when all
she had to do
is walk from the stand to i don't know
12 feet away just sit down
now
if i had not worn a mask would they have
asked me to go get one
i don't know
but i got to think that covering up some
of this is probably a good idea
but christina walks in and they take one
look at her and they say hey you need a
no you don't
no you don't
don't don't be covering any of that up
so
christina can literally walk around
without a mask and mask mandated places
and people will just look at her and say
no we don't want to cover that up you're
good
literally nobody will say a word to her
and i wondered i wonder to what degree
that would apply to you know ordinary
people yeah because she's far from
ordinary
and
have any of you had that experience
where you just go to the restaurant
without a mask and you just act like you
own the place and just sit down
yeah beauty privilege it's no fair at
all is it i don't think so
all right um so i woke up this morning
to find out who had been fired
for the debacle in afghanistan i mean
obviously
obviously somebody in charge is going to
get fired
and then i checked the news
to see about all the people who had been
fired
and there weren't any
what
what
nobody been fired
now
i feel as though
the american public is a lot more
flexible and forgiving
than it seems when we're arguing in
public right you know pundits don't act
too flexible and forgiving but the
public is
and i do believe that the public
understands
that war is messy business
and that
you know things don't go the way you
want and i think even biden could have
been
forgiven for messing things up if he'd
made a good argument for himself i think
he could have been forgiven
a year from now
yeah he probably wouldn't remember
but yeah we'll get to the simultaneous
sip in a moment
but
if you don't fire somebody
i don't know if we can forgive him
can we
because i do have actually probably far
more
let's say forgiveness for the other team
if you will
i'm not really on the other any team per
se but it feels like it
and
but i don't think you can forgive him if
he doesn't fire somebody
or somebody doesn't resign
and i was thinking
what's going to happen in 2022
if nobody gets fired over this thing
have democrats just given up
how could they possibly win any election
going forward until somebody gets fired
for this it just seems too big
there are a lot of things you can say oh
it's just you know baked in we already
assumed it and it was built into our
assumptions about what a democrat is and
what a republican is but when you get a
situation like this
it's not exactly republican or democrat
is it
because trump wanted to withdraw
biden wanted to withdraw so it's not
really even a policy issue
it's pure competence
that's it just pure competence who could
do it better
i don't think anybody thinks trump
couldn't have done this better
now of course it's impossible hey nice
mug
it's impossible to uh
to know i mean we'd be speculating but
it does seem to be that whatever went
wrong here
is exactly the type of thing
that trump doesn't make a mistake in now
i've said before
i'm not i'm not just a trump supporter
no matter what
i don't think he was the right president
for the pandemic
for example he was definitely the right
president for the you know operation
warp speed if you think that worked out
but
he wasn't exactly the
bedside manner kind of president that
maybe he needed in a pandemic you know
that sort of thing and i'll admit that i
think it was just not exactly the right
match for that situation but for the
afghanistan situation
yeah i think he was
i think he was the right match for that
and you know
if you would like to take it up a level
here and enjoy this
live stream to the maximum potential can
you think of any way to do it
well i can all you need is a copper mug
or glass a tanker gel system a canteen
jugger flash vessel any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine here of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it coming at you right now go
that's so good
well joe biden has vowed that isis k
will pay
they will pay for what they've done
he was a little unspecific
but i assume that means he's going to
raise their taxes
i know he's taxing everything else
um so i think he probably thinks he
could raise their taxes
we'll see
um
here's some semi-fake news
[Music]
samoy fake news
uh we've got some real fake news later
but some semi-fake news
which means that there's an element of
truth to it
is that the
that the us military gave the taliban a
kill list
a list of the americans and the afghan
allies
that
are still in country and need to get out
now is that true
true story or fake news
what do you think
is it a true story that we gave the
taliban a list of the americans and the
afghan allies in the country so they can
hunt them down and kill them i mean
that's not why we gave them the list but
it's true-ish
true-ish
the state department says
that they have in effect
in in individual cases
said for example there's a bus coming
through
and here's the names of the people on
the bus
because otherwise the bus wouldn't be
able to get to the checkpoint
so the military had to tell the taliban
who was operating the checkpoints
there's a bus coming
and you better here's the name of the
people on the bus
we'd like you to let them through then
the taliban would check to see if that
was the people on the bus and then
they'd let them through
is that a problem
well it is
it is i mean giving the names of anybody
to the taliban who might be the subject
of some kind of revenge that's a problem
that's a big big problem
but
what was the other thing they could do
what was the alternative
the alternative was they didn't get
through
so it looks to me
like there are a lot of people making
impossible choices over there
things you know a choice between
maybe this person gets killed but maybe
this other person gets killed
so we're making choices about who gets
killed i mean these are real real
leadership
kind of kind of decisions the ones you
don't want to ever make
and
um
i'm not entirely sure based on the fog
of war and the reporting we have so far
that this kill list thing is exactly
what you thought it was when it was
reported because you know the right
right leaning news is going to make it a
kill list
left leading news will probably shade it
a little bit and say well yeah they did
give out some names but not all of them
they were special cases
we'll see how much of a special case
that is at the moment
i'm going to tentatively label this
semi-fake news
here's a question i asked you as we
watched the biden administration
flounder
and disgraced president biden botching
the withdrawal i like to use disgraced
and botched in the same sentence as
often as possible
and we say to ourselves man i'm not so
sure that our government is competent
right now
but here's a question for you
how competent is the taliban leadership
because
it's looking pretty good
isn't it
now i'm not a fan just to be clear
i don't want to compliment the taliban
but they did take over an entire country
in 11 days
and that's not easy
how much planning leadership and
coordination is involved to take over an
entire country in 11 days
it seems like it'd be a lot
what about the public statements that
the taliban has made
can't you imagine a million ways that
they could go wrong
right million ways because you know we
we have their funds frozen and they'd
like to get back presumably
and
uh they make public statements like yes
we will
we will help you get out everybody and
we're not going to get revenge
did that sound very taliban-like we're
not going to seek revenge if you want to
leave yeah be our guest
not very taliban-like kind of different
right
how about
i heard that they said that women can
still go to school and work and stuff
did that sound very taliban
not really
chad
chad bishop you're way too nice i'm not
sure what that's for but thank you
um
the taliban are saying all the right
things
and apparently doing all the right
things and apparently
fairly intent on managing the country
they tried to keep the afghan you know
government workers in place
so does anybody can anybody think of uh
um
a specific
example
where the taliban leadership the the new
ones the recent ones
uh have made a mistake
can anybody in the comments give me an
example of the taliban making a mistake
of course the taliban lie i get that
right we all know that the taliban lie
we're just working through what we know
have they made a mistake yet
um
qatar is advising them somebody says i
don't know if we know that
they have interviewed the women who were
not allowed to go back to work yeah so
one problem the taliban definitely has
is that i don't think the leadership
controls all the individuals
and so i think the leadership might
actually mean what it says at least
temporarily to get get us out of the
country anyway but i don't think the
individual fighters are necessarily
going to do everything the leadership
tells them to do
at the moment you know later they might
get a tighter control on things but at
the moment
we don't know now here's what i want to
see
and we haven't seen it yet
i want to see the taliban executing
their own people
other taliban
i want to see the taliban executing
other taliban for not doing what the
leadership told them to do
because
the things that they're doing
are executable offenses certainly over
there under the taliban so if the
taliban is
i'm not talking about isis k i know the
taliban doesn't control them we're
talking about just the taliban
so if the taliban
does some bad things individually
and it seems like the reporting is
finding it all over the place
at what point does the leadership of the
taliban line those up and shoot
him on video to make their point
at what point does the leadership say
watch us kill our own people
because we're serious about this
if you see that
this isn't the taliban you thought they
were
there's something else going on they're
not good guys right
nobody's saying that i'm just saying
that there seems to be
at least their signaling some intention
of being a legitimate state
with and to have legitimacy
they're going to need to be able to
control their fighters from you know
these
these kinds of massacres and stuff
so i would look for that that's the next
thing i look for is the taliban
executing their own fighters in public
and letting you know we did this look
we told you that women could go to
school
you stopped it we're going to kill you
now and we just execute that guy
if you see that the taliban's serious
and maybe even somebody you could deal
with
despite
obviously not any trust per se
fox news had a hilarious article
i forgot to write down the writer's name
so i apologize but it's on the fox news
site and and they said that cnn keeps
getting victimized by its own guests
how funny is that
that fox news is reporting that cnn
keeps getting victimized by its own
guests now the context is that the
guests the pundits are
uh saying things that aren't true
and cnn you know doesn't know it at the
time when they're on the air
yeah i see i see your comment itchy
thank you for that
so
i think that's just a funny way to frame
this that they're being victimized by
their own guests but here's one example
fake news
allegedly
cnn had a tennessee former vaccine
manager on there dr michelle
fiskus
and she alleged that somebody mailed her
a muzzle
in the mail to keep her from talking
then she joked it was the wrong size
because she's a more of a pitbull than
something else
and
there was a probe and they found that
she bought that muzzle herself with her
own credit card
that's right
she
bought the muzzle herself
with her own credit card now this didn't
happen recently it was just an example
that fox news was giving of how cnn is
putting guests on the air that say
things that aren't true
which is pretty darn funny
victimized by their own guests
so here's here's the good news uh joe
biden
of course has ordered a military strike
he sent down a drone
to kill an isis k planner
so we got him
good news people
we got a planner
isis k planner killed that guy with a
drone strike
um
now i i think we killed him with a drone
strike
um
thanks itchy
and but as uh
as someone wittily commented
whose name i will give you in a moment
because i totally wrote it down uh
rodney howard brown
uh he talks about this uh planner that
we killed with the drone
he says they buried his body as he
so you might never see the body
but
trust me
we totally kill the planner yeah we
didn't do nothing because doing nothing
would look weak and pathetic
we went out we found the planter and we
killed that
so
don't ask us to see the body or the the
you know bomb reports
don't ask us to see video from the drone
just trust us
there was a planner
and now there isn't
because we we fricking killed him with a
drone
feeling pretty good feeling pretty good
about that america america
we're back
we kill the planner
now it was a wedding planner uh they
didn't mention that it was a wedding
planner but
um we killed them
and that's not nothing
how good a planner was he
well he didn't see this coming
didn't see this coming so
might have been a not such a good
planner
now here's one of my theories about
these terrorist organizations it goes
like this
in order to put together a real good
international terrorist organization
you have to be pretty good at planning
and leadership and management right it's
not something anybody can do if you
tried to create an international
terrorist organization how far would you
get
maybe you don't have those skills
and so when i look at us battling
against terrorist groups i always think
if you could kill the top three or four
people
i think we're done
because it's so rare that you could find
somebody who could be a leader in a
situation like that and who would be
good at it and could you know do a 911
kind of a plan
if you kill the person at the top
how good is the second in command
now if it's al-qaeda pretty good
second in command not too bad not not
bin laden
but pretty good
if you kill the second
how about the third still pretty good
still pretty good again not as good as
the first or second person maybe but
pretty good
what if you kill that one in the next
five after that well now you're down to
the not so good leaders
you're down
you're down to the people who maybe
can't play on a 911.
so you don't really have to kill
a lot of terrorists
you only have to kill the top five smart
ones and then they become incompetent
and start fighting with each other and
destroy themselves or something like
that and i always think that you could
take care of pretty much any large group
you know terrorist kind of group just by
getting the top five competent people
um
let's see what else is going on uh
we got uh
the fake
attack
which is actually pretty good strategy
um i wouldn't
first of all i think trump did the same
thing
remember when trump attacked the largely
vacant
base
in syria and he just bombed the hell out
of that mostly empty base
and and the news reported that as a real
tough
you know first impression for the world
this president isn't going to mess
around you know we're going to bomb the
hell out of things and they dropped that
mother of all bombs and stuff so trump
was really good
at at least creating the impression that
he was
seriously dangerous
and
biden is trying to do the same thing
with this mysterious planner we got your
planner
uh but it feels a little weak
but it's in the right
it's in the right domain right at least
at least he's going in the right
direction but i think it was a little
weak
i'm seeing a lot of you mentioning sam
harris he's been in the news
for uh i think i can characterize
the latest as him not being so happy
that he got joe biden
so he had celebrated joe biden's victory
i guess on social media but now he's uh
he's publicly eating his words in his
own words he's eating his words
and
let me throw in a compliment
may i throw in a compliment
and by the way this is good form
if there's somebody who's on the other
side of a debate
see if you can muster a compliment
you know something about the way they
think or they're how well informed they
are or how honest they are or something
because if you can't do that it really
is a red flag that you're just a a
partisan and you're just going to take
the other position but if you can say
something good
and mean it about whoever you're
debating well then maybe your opinion
has some merit and it's not about the
person or being on a team so let me say
that about sam harris he's one of the
most rational
smartest well-informed people in the
public domain so when he says something
i take it seriously
because
you know he earned that right he's got
the
he's got the history
and he's got the
accomplishment to say you pay attention
to
and he's serious
and here's another example why
i was very much on the other position
you know the trump versus anti-trump he
was anti-trump now i don't think he's
pro-trump
nothing like that's happened
but he's certainly having second
thoughts about the quality of the
alternative
and saying it publicly
and to me that's such a sign of
credibility
that i think it puts him ahead
so a lot of you have been asking me to
like you know dance on his grave or
whatever he's still alive but a lot of
you have been asking me to sort of take
a victory lap
uh because it looks like you know i'm
more right than him on on which
president would do a better job
but that's not true i don't think he
would admit that you know trump would
have been a better choice he's just
having some trouble with the the one
that got in there
however i would say that you should
consider his reputation as a
an unbiased
let's say analyst of what's happening
i think it just went up i think his
credibility went up not down
because if you can if you can make
something if you can say something in
public
and then
publicly eat it
that's who i want to listen to next time
right
if you if you can put it out there and
then just eat it in public
that's who you want to trust right
nobody can be right all the time
nobody's going to think every one of
their opinions turns out just right i
don't certainly
so i don't think you want to judge them
on that
you know the all of all of us
uh we we public pundits we're gonna get
some stuff right and some stuff wrong
but if you judge people on the fact that
they did get stuff wrong
it's kind of not really a useful
judgment because everybody's getting
stuff wrong
you should judge people on how they
handle it
right
how do you handle it
how he handled it
was perfect
right
he unambiguously ate his words right in
front of you and told you he was doing
it and then he ate them
all right so that's as good as you can
get
ian bremmer i saw him predict that the
if i remember this correctly he said
that
congress could swing 40 seats to the gop
in 2020
is i didn't i didn't do my one minute of
research to find out if that changes the
majority would 40 would 40 swings
change the majority it would right
i'm saying yeses yeah yeah that somebody
said barely
somebody says 5 would i
this is a perfect example of
me being ignorant in public because
that's sort of an important number isn't
it like to understand what's going on in
the world
i should know how close how close that
is and i didn't know that off the top of
my head i knew it was close to ish but i
didn't know the number
okay
um
okay people people think that that will
make a difference
all right
um
i think it will make a difference too
because number one you know the gop will
never let this go right
the afghanistan withdrawal
is
biden owns it the democrats own it and
it's going to hurt
i don't think there are that many topics
that can really change an election
but because this is not a partisan issue
weirdly you know we have our only
non-partisan issue
that i can even remember can you
remember a non-partisan issue
it feels like there's never been one
before but this is one
that you know everybody wanted to get
out and everybody wanted to get out
right and it didn't happen
we're all on the same side on that so at
least it's unifying that way
but if i were a democrat i honestly i
think i'd just give up i'll hope
i don't think that it feels like and of
course yeah we have short memory so
maybe two months from now we'll just be
talking about something else but it
feels like
the republicans are going to take
everything
the way it's set up at the moment i see
the republicans taking everything
no you
and they've got a pretty good argument
to to make that happen
here's another in let's call this
surprising yet
positive news
um
did you know
did i watch bill maher
last night
bill maher
did a fairly extended compliment to greg
gutfeld
on fox news for his new show the
gregfeld
show um which is
uh competing with the other late night
shows and beating them all
so greg has the highest rated show
in its time slot against
uh and he's on cable news
so just imagine this
he's beating all of the competition and
he's on cable which is a much smaller
universe than
than the broadcast networks not even
close
so
uh
so bill maher who you would imagine
would not necessarily be a fan of
anything fox news had only compliments
for him and his show
and i guess that's the news
there was no but
it was just a pure compliment
and
but he made a good point about it you
know beyond the fact that he he likes
greg and apparently knows him
and he was just complimenting the show
and
the the point he made about it is that
it wasn't maybe possible to do that kind
of show
until the the left part of the universe
became absurd enough that you had a
humor that you could make naturally now
bill maher was saying it was easy to
make fun of the right because there were
all these silly things happening there
and it was just naturally easy but it
wasn't as hard it was it was harder to
make fun of the left because they were
just saying things like
shouldn't we have equal rights
all right how do you make fun of that
there's no there's nothing there there's
no material yeah yeah we should have
equal rights
okay
um
but at this point you know when it's
gone overwoke things are a little a
little crazy
so i thought that was a again another
good sign that maybe some of the adults
are
starting to emerge
right and i think
bill maher is one of the adults
simply because he has the capability to
take a side wherever the
wherever the data plus his opinion lead
him
not many people can do that there are
only a few people can do that in public
sam harris just did it
right
sam harris i considered him an adult in
the room even i disagree with him
and
bill maher same thing
even when i disagree with him on a topic
he's definitely an adult in the room
and it feels like
there's a leadership vacuum
do you feel it
you do right
no you feel a leadership vacuum
it's like a big one
i don't know if i've ever felt this
before have you
have you ever felt in your entire
lifetime if you're an american let's say
have you ever felt a leadership vacuum
it's kind of weird and it seems to me
that when there's a vacuum you know
something steps up to fill it and i'm
wondering if there if there is not
something like a uh
i know like a volunteer army of adults
that are just sort of starting to emerge
people who
you could trust not to take a side
and you could trust them to at least do
their best to look at the data and try
to be rational about it doesn't mean
they'd be right
but i feel like
something is emerging i don't i don't
have a good look at it yet but it has
something to do with the the bill mars
sam harris's
and you know maybe you could come up
with some examples that are more
right-leaning
um
chad says for a hundred dollars he paid
a hundred dollars to
to put this uh
uh his comment in
uh in a noticeable form here he says
leadership vacuum the dog that is not
barking
why is no city no state or the us
government tracking and publishing the
number of coveted
recovered with antibody serology
uh first of all is that true then nobody
nobody anywhere is tracking the number
of recovered
because now you wouldn't be able to
count them you would have to track them
with some kind of statistical
sampling right
um
i don't know that that's true though is
it
is it true that we don't
routinely check the blood of random
people to find out how many people have
recovered
uh i can tell you i don't know the
number
so at the very least it doesn't seem
like it's being widely reported
that's a good point
i would like to see that
um
yes
now
i did say that democrats are good at
leadership when it doesn't involve three
things
so i don't want to be completely
insulting to democrats so i'm going to
say they are quite good at leadership
except in three categories
the three categories that they're not
good at would be anything really money
freedom or security
otherwise
pretty good pretty good but if any topic
has money freedom or security involved
in any way
and not so good
not so good
and i was wondering if that might be
a
republican
attack
because there
it's kind of sticky isn't it and when
you hear it it feels true doesn't it
feels kind of true
that democrats are good at leadership
unless it involves money freedom or
security because i feel as though
even democrats think that's true
right
let me ask you this i
they're probably
roughly zero democrats watching this if
there are any democrats watching this
do you feel does that hit like a little
too close to home the democrats are
great at leadership unless it involves
money freedom or security
it does feel a little true doesn't it
like if you take off your partisan hat
it feels a little true
and that's like the sign of a good
attack is that even the
even the attack
target says that's a little bit true
um
ex-democrat here and it's jewish for
sure i'm saying in the comments i'm
saying more truths
i don't know if you're democrats or not
but some people are agreeing with that
all right
um
yeah let me make sure that i have
covered all of my important notes oh
here's one she's
unbelievable
so uh jack posabic is uh
reporting on twitter
and i've seen other reports new york
post has some kind of a story on it that
there are u.s special forces veterans
who are coordinating their own privately
funded operations to go into afghanistan
and rescue people
now
let me ask you this
what would be
a bigger sign of your
commander-in-chief's chief failing
completely
i think the the most uh obvious sign of
a commander-in-chief
failing completely
is if ex-military people form their own
units to go fight a war
in effect you know war and quotes
chad what the hell are you doing
uh
chaz chad tipped me another hundred
dollars i i i don't need that much money
chad
so um thank you and i appreciate your
enthusiasm but don't don't tip me that
much
that that makes me uncomfortable
i'm sure you need that 100 more than i
do i mean i appreciate it as a
compliment
and i am i am in fact completely
motivated by money
even though i haven't
i'm motivated in the sense that if
somebody says hey
i give you a tip for
doing whatever you did i'd probably do
more of it because i like compliments
and i like doing what people like
so yeah the the tipping has an effect on
my psychology it doesn't have much
effect on my bank account
um but thank you chad i appreciate that
anyway so these u.s special forces
coordinating their own operation over
there
and
i don't know how biden could possibly
stay in office
if the military
has decided to do its own thing
you
talk about losing the confidence of the
military
when the military just says we'll do our
own damn mission and fund it ourselves
put our put our lives on the line
because you're not getting it done
you honestly you can't fail harder than
that
that is the hardest fail
of any failure you could even think of
i mean it'd be hard to think of any
um
it'd be hard to think of any you know
failure that there's more
stark than that
um
all right
so
here's my next question
do you think
that given that there are like a
thousand isis k people and
probably the taliban can figure out
where they are
um
don't you think
don't you think that there will be
mercenary groups that are just going on
hunting expeditions over there
for a long time
i feel like the taliban could issue a
hunting permit and just say oh who are
you okay you're a mercenary force
mostly american but you've got a few
other europeans in there or whatever
and you've identified yourself
you made yourself known to the taliban
and you said we'd like a hunting license
to go hunt isis
or to hunt for you know people who want
to be taken out
i almost think the taliban would
authorize them
almost i mean i don't know if they would
but let's say it was a group of i don't
know 20 mercenaries
and those 20 mercenaries said we're
gonna you know stay in the same place
you know we'll be on one mission
and we'll tell you where we are and
we're just going to go kill some isis
for you because they want them dead too
i feel like
i feel like it's so close to being a
thing
that you have to take it seriously i'm
not predicting it'll happen
but it's very close to being a thing
isn't it
and especially if the taliban were going
to pay for i'm sorry if the
if the mercenaries were going to pay the
taliban
so i suppose the mercenaries say we want
to buy a license
plumber mike you're funny
uh i suppose the mercenaries say we'd
like to buy a license to go hunt some
taliban or whatever they're gonna hunt
over there and uh we'll pay you a
hundred thousand dollars
just to have the right to go in country
and
shoot some bad guys i don't know
maybe
for a hundred thousand dollars that's a
lot of money if you're the taliban
all right um
yes the best kickstarter idea ever
it would be an interesting reality show
sick as that is
it would be interesting all right that's
about all i have for today did i miss
anything
any stories i missed
um
the taliban made 600 million in 2020 did
they
from illegal stuff right
um
yeah and it looks like
you know you heard that uh i guess trump
made a deal with the taliban that in
uh in return for agreeing to leave that
they would stop attacking us
for a long time
and apparently they did
so the taliban actually somewhat kept
their deal with trump of not attacking
until we were you know we were out of
country and think to yourself
is that telling us something
because again it just keeps looking like
the
um
it just keeps looking
like the taliban are trying to act like
a civilized country
um
prediction question will boosters catch
on or cause vaccines to fail
well you've heard that there's some risk
to the boosters right
so it's a theoretical risk but it's
based on you know sound science
which is that there's some scenario in
which for some people at least the
booster might be a problem
but i kind of
i kind of would need to see a lot more
on that it feels like by the time i get
the booster
i feel like i'll know
because i waited as long as possible to
get the vaccination because i wanted as
much history of other people getting it
as i could
so just selfishly i decided to go last
and see if anybody else has a problem
with it first i'll do the same thing
with the booster
if a lot of people got the booster
several months of booster shots go by
you don't hear a big tragedy
i'll get a booster
now i have the luxury of doing that
because i got my vaccination late
so my immunity should be you know
reasonable all the way through the
booster period
but i'll i plan to get a booster i mean
that's my current thinking but
i'll check the data as it goes
somebody says florida has beaten covent
here's here's a good tip
when you hear some information about
covid and a particular state
it's not true
that's it that's the whole advice
if you hear anything about covet in a
particular state or even a particular
country
none of it's true
i don't think any of it's ever true now
part of it is that people disagree what
is the data for a state or a country but
generally speaking everything about that
one state or that whether sweden or
israel or anybody else or anything about
that one country
it's just never it's
just never true
i mean well let's let's take that back
to say 95 percent of the time it's not
true
so just do that
just do that just tell your brain
oh somebody said something about a state
that was doing well or poor or or not
and we're a country just your brain
should say probably not true and you'd
be right most the time
uh larry elder update um i don't know
that there's an update per se
i think he's still leading
among the people who would take over if
the
the government recall is successful
and
i'm going to predict
that the polling is a little bit
inaccurate
and that more people will vote to get
rid of
the governor governor newsom
than the polls suggest so i think
there's a polling bias happening here
that's not
terribly unlike
trump derangement syndrome
but
maybe the other version of that
in which if you ask a lifelong democrat
if they're going to vote for a democrat
again
i feel like they just say yes
because they they don't want to be
inconsistent
but they might only want to be in they
might only want to be consistent in
public
right talk meaning pub talking to the
pollster i feel like when they get in
that little booth
some of them are going to say
you know i was a lifelong democrat but
this is going too far you know that's
just too much
let's just say that newsome is the joe
biden of california
how do you like that governor newsome is
the joe biden of california
yeah
it's pretty good isn't it
you put that out there a couple of days
before the vote and suddenly newsome
will be paying for the afghan pull out
because you just have to tie those two
together
just just make people think of the two
of them as a pair
and you just say uh
governor newsome is the poor man's joe
biden
you throw in the poor man's
and it's even worse
yeah
you want governor newsom yeah we think
of him as the poor man's joe biden
that's pretty good
um
do you notice that most of the news
about kamala harris
is about what she's avoiding doing
there should be two sets of news about
kamalaires one is what she's doing
which tends to be you know a short list
uh she went to vietnam
and that there should be a larger list
for the things she's avoiding doing
because that ends up being the story
well she didn't say anything about this
well she hasn't visited any troops well
um
i'm being asked do you ever feel like
the dems and the republicans and the
whole system are quote in on it no i
don't i don't i do think it's
a everyone for themselves system
with a couple of teams
um
the unit party
no i don't think it's a uniparty but i
think that there are some things they
all like such as war
all right
uh yeah what about the border
don't hear too much about the border
uh the war party is a thing yeah i mean
when it comes to war they they tend to
agree
but i'm not sure you would want that to
be not the case
um
so i did uh just upload a micro lesson
on how to on on the local platform for
subscribers only
my latest micro lesson is how to brag
without bragging
so in other words how to let people know
that you have some skills
chad what the hell is wrong with you
uh
so chad says uh for fifty dollars
i i don't know if you're getting your
money's worth but you say you are
um
i just discovered i cannot pay for a
super chat and include the youtube link
oh
so the youtube link he's trying to alert
us to is sioux falls city council
meeting
unity through community immunity
well it's a clever headline unity
through community immunity so chad wants
you to google that and take a look and i
guess me too
all right that's all i got for now
and uh we better end before chad runs
out of money
uh i wish you were also all as awesome
as chad but chad don't spend that much
money on me really don't do that but i
appreciate it five dollars i would have
seen it
no refunds and
thank you everybody and thank you
especially chad
bye for now
