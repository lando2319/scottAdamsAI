hey everybody
come on in good morning it's time
for coffee with scott adams people are
saying
that this one will be the best one ever
yeah people are saying that all over the
globe
i can't give you any specific names a
lot of them are anonymous sources
but they are saying this will be the
best coffee with scott adams and all you
need
to make it a peak experience you don't
need much
all you need is a copper mug or glass a
tanker chelsea stein
a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope mean hit of the day
the thing that makes
everything better except for hunter's
laptop
it's called the simultaneous hip and it
happens now go
yes i feel the images on that laptop
are now all over 18 years old
so i guess the simultaneous sip can fix
just about everything all right
before we start you should see my new
video that i just
put up on youtube it's in my usual place
that my other videos are but you can see
it
uh pinned on my twitter feed as well an
interview with
uh nikki klein member of
nexium which you would call a cult
she would call something else maybe an
organization
a company which they were associated
with
and let me tell you that the story you
get
from a person who is central to the
entire situation
and this is how central nikki
uh is and was so she's actually still
married
to alice and mack so allison mack was
sort of the
you know people called her like the
second in command at nexium
under keith renery
with canary i'm told and
she's got a story a version of the story
that is not exactly what you've heard
and there's a twist here
and all a little bit of a spoiler
there is some concern that the trial of
keith
renery has a big irregularity
and you know as i've said before
two years ago if you told me hey i think
the justice system is not operating the
way it should
i would have said well that's what
everybody says
you know if you if you get sucked into
the legal system
of course you think it's railroading an
innocent person
everybody says that well listen to the
story
and you're going to walk away scratching
your head and saying
um i got some real questions about how
this is being handled
some real questions and they ought to be
answered soon
because the sentencing happens tomorrow
so
keith renery was found guilty
on several counts
sentencing tomorrow it was delayed
because it grotovirus i guess
and here's the thing
i still haven't seen anything that i
could determine as a crime
and when the press talks about the
conviction they don't really
pair anything that happened with those
crimes
so that so there's some real questions
about
what's going on there and i would be
concerned about whether justice
has been served now of course everybody
gets to tell their story the way they
get to tell it
so i can't fact check anybody's story
but when you see how different this
version is
and as you've experienced you know the
political news
two movies on uh on one screen
you're gonna see two movies on one
screen again
in a different context and i think
you're gonna enjoy it
so check that out all right uh
mike pence continues to campaign
despite the fact that five of his close
aides including his body man
have coronavirus but pence does not
or at least the tests do not show it yet
it can take
you know i think up to a week to test
positive if you're infected
which i don't quite understand do you
uh i'm trying to understand the
following
uh my understanding is that you could go
several days
of being infected but the test will not
detect it
but now help me with this next part if
the test
can't detect that you're infected
can you spread it because the whole
point of spreading it
is that there's virus coming out of your
pores
right or at least it's coming out of
your mouth
and if the test tests your mouth
or you know your nose area whatever the
testing and there's no virus that the
test
can detect can you give it to somebody
is the test so
insensitive that you could have a bunch
of virus
enough to transmit it and the test won't
pick it up
and i'm talking about whatever test a
vice president would get
right he's not getting the cheap test
i'm assuming the
vice president gets a good test you know
one that they
rely on now that still would open up
the possibility that he he becomes
uh you know virally uh let's say
measurably viral
in between the tests that he probably
gets in the morning
and the test that he probably gets in
the evening because you know they're
testing him twice a day right
i mean i don't know that but it feels
somewhat obvious and i don't know how
you could imagine it could be anything
else
so i would imagine that pence is just
getting so tested that his nose is raw
um but does that create a little extra
risk
for the people he is with yes yes it
does
creates a little extra risk probably not
nearly as much
as cnn would like you to believe because
they
they do what i call angry reporting
let let me show you the difference
between reporting
and angry reporting reporting would look
like this
vice president pence although people
around him have tested positive
has continued to campaign some people
are concerned that he could spread it
but of course he's being tested
every several hours so the risk is being
minimized
so that's what it would look like if you
were just to report the news
now i would like to do jake tapper
reporting the same news mike
pence is he's campaigning
with positive uh
infecting people it's like the same news
except you you do something with your
eyebrows
you pearl them you get really angry
and then you report that news
something's going on here and i don't
like it
but i believe that this is yet another
case
where the president and vice president
have have read the room correctly
if you listen to the news it's like ah
it's the end of the world
this vice president is causing a bad
role model but you know what else he's
doing
he's acting like you would act
right so this is the thing that the
president gets right
just a lot right
and you assume that pence's decision is
really the president's decision
in this case i'm sure they work together
on it but you know you know that
president trump
wants him to keep keep going here's the
thing
every single person who is watching the
news
has bent the rules a little bit
right do you think there's anybody that
you know
who has not bent the corona virus
you know rules about social distancing
etc is there anybody who hasn't momentum
a little bit
now i think if we do you know mostly
what we're supposed to do most of the
time
you can get a pretty good result but we
all bend
we bend it a little bit a little bit of
bending and so when you watch your
leaders
doing the same thing which is pence's
he's uh
he's playing a little fast and loose
with that rule he's
saying he's an essential employee i
guess you could say he is but
but really you know he's just bending
the rule
how do you feel when you've bent that
rule a thousand times
or let's say a few times and you watch
somebody else bend it
well you don't get that judgy do you
if you watch cnn they they report it
like all of the people on cnn never bend
those rules
they've never done anything that would
cause a little extra risk
but of course they have because they're
human beings
in a complex situation we're doing the
best we can
but we're bending the rules a little bit
so when you see pence do that
part of you might say hey maybe that's a
bad role model
you know you could make that argument
but there's another part of the youth
that says
he's a warrior right
he's wounded in a sense he may not have
the coronavirus but
he's wounded in a conceptual sense
and he's still on the field he didn't
leave the field
he took a hit he didn't take a timeout
he just kept fighting there's some part
of you that likes that
because he's not just fighting for
himself
right they're they're fighting to be the
leaders of the
of the country and to fight for us do
you want the person who surrenders
with a flesh wound kamala harris was in
a similar situation her staff
had a positive result and she went into
quarantine
good role model right good role model
went into quarantine just like the
experts say
warrior nope nope
she got off as soon as she got a a small
neck you know a flesh wound she left the
field
she did what she was told is that what
leaders do
so you have this weird situation where
there's there's something that's the
right thing to do and you know what it
is and it's to follow the experts and
you know try to reduce the risk wherever
you can but then there's the other part
of you that says
i don't want my leader to be a giant
right i mean there's some part of you
that says
i'll be cautious but i'm not sure you
should be
and i think the president gets that
right by the way
now obviously there's people who have
different opinions on that
but for his voters and for the purpose
of getting re-elected
i think i think trump is reading the
room right
that's what it feels like to me
um there have been more photos
uh on that uh the hunter biden laptop
and the latest ones are are more
shocking than
really i had imagined i don't know if
you've heard the news yet but
there's a new photo going around and uh
you don't want to look at it trust me so
i'll describe it
but don't don't look at it it's a it's a
photo of uh
hunter biden apparently he was
vacationing in wuhan in 2019
and there's some video of him having sex
with a bat
you don't want to see it anyway
so i'll let that sink in a little bit
before i go to the next story
um
his father joe biden was out doing his
uh speaking yesterday before
i guess before the lid was put on
he's got a nine-day lid before the he
put a lid
on all the rest of his campaign but
this might be a reason why it happened
i'm just going to put this out there
that joe biden forgot who he was running
against for president
and referred to trump as george
twice he goes quote
four more years of george uh george
uh he uh biden said
uh gonna find ourselves in a position
where trump gets elected and then
he found his found his footing there
called him trump
but i still think he thinks it's george
trump
so could be better that could be better
um
so right after uh joe biden
i think i have the timing right correct
me if i don't
but he called a lid so that for the next
nine days until the election
you won't see any more joe biden now
what does that tell you
well here's what it tells me if
if joe biden thinks that the country
is better off with less joe biden for
the next nine days
because that's what he's doing right if
his point is to be running for
office for the benefit of the country
then
what we're observing him doing during
this phase
in theory should be for the benefit of
the country why would he do something
that's not
for the benefit of the country while
he's running for president
for the benefit of the country right so
you have to think that whatever you see
him do
he has reasoned out might be good for
his campaign but also would have to be
good for the country
or else he shouldn't be doing it in
public right
so hunter i'm sorry joe biden has
decided
that what's best for the united states
for now
is to have less of him
so he put a lid on it so he's just going
to disappear for nine days
now if joe biden thinks that the country
is better off
for those nine days without him
what is it that's going to change on the
10th day
that make us suddenly need him
well i suppose getting elected would do
it but it's a weird
proposition isn't it i'm running for
president to help the country
and the first thing i'm going to do is
give you much less of me
i think we should take him at his word
if we need less
joe biden let's give it to him
the rasmussen polling group
they've they've started doing a daily
tracking of
uh not likely voter approval that's
that's what they've been doing so
approval
of likely voters gets you sort of an
indirect indication of how the vote
itself might go
but it's not asking voters who are going
to vote for
it's asking them approval which could be
a little different from who they vote
for
so at uh approximately
i think in about 13 minutes or so
rasmussen will be
uh publishing the first of their series
of daily tracking polls for who you're
actually going to vote for
so in this case they've actually asked
people nationally
who are you going to vote for where do
you see that
i'm not i'm not going to spoil it but
i might have seen a little sneak preview
and i'm just going to say this
where do you see that
so that's just your teaser for the day
in today's out of context news which is
the only kind we get
right now the entire news cycle is just
people taking things out of context
and then criticizing the thing that
didn't happen but it looks like it
happened
if you take it out of context so
yesterday mark meadows
worded something poorly i guess
in the sense that it opened him up for
this criticism
he he said that the u.s is quote
not going to control the coronavirus
pandemic
which caused his critics to say what
what are you saying mark meadows are you
saying that
we're giving up and of course you know
kamal harris
takes that and says that that means
they're giving up
they're not they're not going to control
the coronavirus pandemic
this is the dumbest freaking thing i've
ever seen
let me ask you which country is
controlling the pandemic
that's not even a thing you can't
control the kit
the pandemic you can do what you can do
and you can do everything that you can
do but you can't control the pandemic
all right you can't control the rain but
you can wear a raincoat
you can't control a hurricane but you
could go into your hurricane bunker
you can't control cancer totally
but you might be able to develop some
cures some treatments
so of course mark meadows is making a
an obvious simple universally
understood statement that you can't
control a pandemic
and then his critics you know act like
it's a completely different statement
oh we're going to give up and just let
the pandemic sweep through and kill as
many people as possible because
you can't control the pandemic
so when you watch the you know the
alleged
news this is news
this isn't news this is taking somebody
out of context
that's all it is it's nothing but that
there isn't a single newsworthy thing in
the statement
that humans can't control a virus that
has swept across the globe
because you know what if we could
control the frickin virus
i'm pretty sure we would have done it
now you could certainly
you know do more always you could always
do more you could always do sooner
but you can't control a pandemic that's
dumb all right
so it's sort of a fun day for news wise
so 60 minutes were in their their
interviews
with uh trump and with kamal harris and
biden
and the big news ahead of it
that you had been told is that trump
stormed off and ended the interview
you know before it was over isn't that
why you heard
i heard that everywhere i heard it all
over social media
i saw it in the news that trump ended it
early
and stormed off and then i watched it
that didn't happen nothing like that
happened
let me explain to you what a
photographer once described to me
who this photographer was doing a photo
shoot of me some years ago
and he he had done lots of photo shoots
of
famous people and he he tells me this
story
he goes he had been asked to do a photo
shoot of
bill gates for some national publication
now if it's a national publication you
want a really good
photo and i've been on a number of
magazine covers
and i know that to do a magazine cover
shoot it's a real big operation
you know you're bringing in you know
backdrops and you know
lighting and you've got three different
cameras and you've got your
your assistant and you're changing film
and you know not film but
you're you know you're changing cameras
and it's it's a big big operation
can take let's say an hour
so a reporter or i'm sorry a
photographer
to do a big photo shoot of somebody like
bill gates
would want at least an hour and
sometimes they'd want more
they'd want to get there early and set
up and do some
shoots of you know somebody has to stand
in to get the lights right and
everything
but bill gates walks into a photo shoot
and he says you have 10 minutes
and the photographer knowing he needs an
hour i mean he needs an hour
he knows his job this is no this is not
a photographer who started
yesterday you know you get the best most
experienced photographer to do a bill
gates photo shoot
and bill gates says you have 10 minutes
the photographer knows
he knows he needs an hour he's like
i can't do it in 10 minutes i just i
just need an hour
and bill gates says you have 10 minutes
uh nine and a half and the
photographer's i can't do it i can't do
it
all right all right he grabs his camera
starts shooting gets you know
gets maybe 10 10 snaps
and he knows he needs 150 to be able to
pick a good one
and then bill gates stands up and he
goes all right we're done
he walks out and the photographer has to
pick from his 10 snaps
and one of them's good enough and it
becomes the cover and everything's fine
did the world end nope
did they not get a photo of bill gates
no they did
they got exactly what they wanted who
decided
when the photography session was over
and how long it should be
not the photographer that's not how it
works
bill gates decides when it's over
bill gates decides how long he's going
to be there and that's the beginning and
the end of the story
it's not up to anybody else so
when i watched the actual footage of
trump storming off which is what i'd
heard before i saw it
i expected something like that i thought
he would angrily get up
and say i'm not answering that question
and you know throw down the
lavalier and walk off all angry
something like that
but that's not what i saw and not even
close
what you saw was the president of the
united states
in control of his own schedule and
that's it
because let me let me give this advice
to 60 minutes as i tweeted earlier today
60 minutes you don't decide
how long the interview is that's not
your decision
when did you think that happened when
did 60 minutes get
to be in control of president trump's
schedule
one of them is the fake news the other
is the leader of the free world the
president decides when it's over
and if you watch the video he simply
decided it was over
you know he obviously he didn't want to
do more of it because it was
becoming nasty but there was a natural
break
and instead of continuing after the
break the president just said it's over
you have enough all the president did is
what every ceo does
in every photo shoot and then
and also in interviews the ceo
decides when it's over the president of
the united states
he's the one who decides when you're
done there's no
there's no wiggle room there right this
is not a shared responsibility
60 minutes doesn't get a vote
and so the the whole framing of it as
he left early doesn't make any sense at
all
because the president left when he was
done
that's when you're done you're done when
he's done
that's it that's the whole story anyway
watching that develop into a whole fake
news thing was fascinating
but then i saw the clip of kamalaris
i think kamala harris ended
any chance she has of helping the team
and becoming part of the government with
that interview it was
it was bad i don't know if it's
the worst interview i've ever seen on 60
minutes
it could be and the thing that
uh harris gets wrong
is the the uh the persona the
the presidential vibe now what has
everybody been
accusing president trump of since the
beginning
he's not presidential you are not
tweeting presidential
you're not presidential but remember i
told you
on periscope yesterday you can get used
to anything
over the last three and a half years our
understanding of what it is to be
presidential
started out as this big history of other
presidents
and this president trump didn't match
that history
so he felt a little unpresidential by
that standard
but of course he said he's modern
presidential and
and i i actually accept that definition
he is his own person
but now that time has gone by trump
himself
not completely but to some extent
has become your your mental model
of what presidential looks like right
what is one of the things that president
trump is often criticized for
that i don't think is true but he gets
criticized for it
they say he never laughs how
presidential
is laughing at your own joke
not very it just sort of doesn't look
literally i laugh at my own jokes but
i'm a professional and i'm allowed to do
that
so kamala harris i'm going to do my
kamala harris
answering a question and if you're
listening to this
on podcast and can't see the visuals oh
you're missing so much
because my impression of kabul harris is
just spot on
and one of the things she did i don't
know if i've ever seen her do this
before
is she kept her mouth open while she was
listening
so she laughed really hard and then kept
her mouth open
while she's listening to the rest of the
question and it made her eyes look crazy
at the same time and i don't know if
it's related
or if it was an illusion because the
mouth was crazy
but this is kabul harris
answering a question
see now if you're listening on podcast
that last five seconds
was hilarious if you'd seen the visual
uh and she she actually just
stayed in that position with her mouth
open
for way too long
and she looked like the village idiot
now kabul harris
is a smart human being
i mean there's no doubt about that right
if you gave her a standardized iq test
she'd do great i mean you look at the
jobs she's had the accomplishments she's
had
for god's sake she's a u.s senator
she is a smart accomplished human being
which we could all you know we all wish
we could be as
capable as she is so i'll say i'll say a
lot of good things about her
and they're all true but she looked like
a village idiot
and you can't you can't shake that
right now 60 minutes got a lot of play
in part because the story about the
president walking off
probably probably got them more
attention than they would have gotten
otherwise
but that was devastating i don't know if
i've ever seen a worse
interview than that
let's say
here's something to worry about if
you're a biden supporter
and trust me you've got a lot to worry
about in the next few days
have you noticed that the entire time
that
trump has been behind in the polls
that trump supporters have not looked as
worried as you think they oughta
sure there's been plenty of worry you
know there's always worry
and concern and uncertainty it's always
there
but is it my imagination
or have the democrats been far more
worried
while being way ahead in the polls
because they've got this to this
2016 ptsd still
still very much part of their
personalities and the ptsd says
it's not a problem until that last week
or so
and that last week anything could happen
anything could happen for example
right about now there should be a pole
dropping
from rasmussen and that would be an
example of
anything could happen in those last few
days
if you see the poll uh put it in the
comments and let me know
all right um so here's what the biden
supporters should be concerned about
have you been watching all the uh trump
rallies and
you know parades and boat boat rallies
and everything else
and have you noticed that there's one
thing that they all have in common
that the trump supporters have started
using the american flag
as a uh as a campaign prop
for trump in other words um
the whole country i think both left and
right
has begun to associate the american flag
only with trump
just think about that right you probably
maybe it didn't
you know it may have snuck up on you but
you've noticed all the american flags
that are a substitute and a direct
substitute with
with no change you don't have to add
anything
for a trump uh poster
you don't have to put a trump sign in
your lawn
you only have to put up the american
flag
and everybody will know who you're
voting for
think about that how would you like to
be running for president of the united
states
the united states it's a country
with a flag betsy ross created it
it's very popular among some people not
everybody apparently
not always in professional sports but
the american flag don't count it out
all right no matter how many stories you
hear
about somebody's burning one somebody
doesn't want to stand for it
somebody wants to kneel for it those
stories give you a
false sense of how the country responds
to their most potent symbol
the american flag is really powerful
with the american public and when you
say that joe biden
is so disassociated with the american
flag
that you can use it as a substitute
for a trump poster have we ever seen
anything like that
has there ever been a campaign
where one of the presidential candidates
could use the american flag
as a substitute for his own
brand come on
that that is other level stuff all right
it sneaks up on you because you know
that the number of flags just sort of
started increasing until it was just
flagotopia
and then you say oh i get it now
flag equals trump years from now
when when all of the you know the tds
has worn down
this is going to be one of those things
that historians are going to look back
at
and say oh my freaking
deity i i didn't see it when it was
happening
but this is the most phenomenal
branding exercise of all time
no president has ever no candidate has
ever branded
themselves with the american flag
and made a stick it's just crazy how
good that is
in terms of in terms of technique how
good that is
that it got to that point all right
uh let's talk about uh
how to bamboozle inexperienced voters
as the as the creator of the dilbert
comic strip
i can speak to this with great authority
and it goes like this i see in the
comments somebody's saying that reagan
did a good job of branding himself with
the flag
and i would accept that but he ran
against people who
also would be associated with the flag
like he didn't he didn't own it
he you know he was more of it i guess
so here's how you bamboozle
inexperienced people and
young people if there's
something that they want let's say a
policy
that they would like the government to
do and let's say you're running for
president and you want them to vote for
you but you don't want to do what they
want
you to do so you want to you want to
bamboozle some young people into voting
for you
by making them think they might get what
they want
but you're not going to give it to them
in reality what do you do
you want them to think you're going to
do it
but you're not going to do it well
here's how you do it you say that you're
going to form a bipartisan commission to
study it
and again as the creator of the dilbert
cartoon
let me say with complete authority that
if you're going to form a bipartisan
commission to study it
you're not going to do it because the
whole reason that you form a bipartisan
commission is to send the idea off to
the
the graveyard of ideas all right
if if you can get a bipartisan
commission
meaning that there are republicans on
the commission
all right if you can get the republicans
on your bipartisan commission
to say it would be a good idea to pack
the supreme court
or to limit the term of the dominant
republican or at least conservative
leaning
good luck with that good luck with your
bipartisan commission
because i'm sure those republicans are
going to get talked into that real
easily
so i think president trump should uh
take a page from that
so he's oh he could take two pages from
it so here's what trump could do he
could say you know
i think we could do better on health
care so the day i'm elected
i'm going to form a bipartisan
commission on health care
there you go you want you young people
you democrats you want uh
you want universal health care or health
health insurance for everybody
i'll give you a bipartisan commission
and we'll look into it right after i get
elected
yeah so that would be fine
right who could argue with a bipartisan
commission
how about climate change a lot of
democrats would like the president to
take
climate change more seriously and to
deal with it
you know more aggressively but you know
what would help
a bipartisan commission so president
trump could say you know
the day after i'm re-elected i'll get
you your bipartisan commission
and then that gives people a reason to
vote for him now the beauty of this
of what biden is doing is it's actually
a really good play
because it's definitely the younger
people and the less experienced people
he's trying to bamboozle
who don't understand that a bipartisan
commission
means no they will learn that
they might learn it the hard way but
you've got a lesson coming
young people all right uh let's talk
about
uh all the news about hunter's laptop
um so of course
the big story is that
there's you know these allegations and
this news
and uh and the mainstream media you know
the the big
respected media is disappearing the
story
and simply aggressively not covering it
they're not only not covering it they're
really mad at anybody who suggests that
it should be covered
because it violates every standard
of professional journalism you know why
because it's it's unsubstantiated
right that makes sense the press doesn't
want to cover a story that's
unsubstantiated or as they would like to
say
baseless would you want would you want a
professional
press to start covering a bunch of
baseless stories that they can't
substantiate no no because if they
started doing that
what could that lead to well the next
thing you know
some author is going to write a book
with a whole bunch of
anonymous sources
and then that's going to get on the news
it's going to be this unsubstantiated
claims
in the form of a book let's say
knocking a president or something and
and if if journalists started treating
that stuff
like something that should be covered by
the journalists
well what's that going to do it's going
to encourage people
to write books about the president
with anonymous sources in them and you
know that's not
you don't want that to happen right oh
right
that already happens just about once
every three weeks
and they cover the piss out of it
unsubstantiated though it may be
because they talk to the author is that
what covers
is that what counts as substantiation
yeah we we talked to the person who made
the claim
oh i guess we're done here good enough
let's put it on the air
prime time that baby
how about russia collusion that was all
pretty substantiated right
oh no it never happened how was it
that for three years the press covered
russia collusion when none of it was
substantiated and indeed when the
mueller report came out
said didn't happen or at least nobody
could find anything
so the standard that they have now
of something that is baseless and
unsubstantiated
requires a hilarious twist
and it requires them to ignore the fact
that this tony babilinski guy who is the
business associate of hunter biden has
confirmed
the the uh you know the validity of
at least one of the emails and some of
the other emails i guess
on the alleged 100 biden laptop
all right so now you've got an email
that okay maybe you can't tell if that
was faked
but now you have a human being who is a
direct
witness who has come forward publicly we
know his name
he's not anonymous and he has
credibility there's nothing about him or
his history
that would suggest he has any
sketchiness about him as far as i know
he's an ex-navy guy looks like a solid
citizen as far as we can tell
and are you telling me that the
mainstream media
doesn't know how to find tony boblinski
when he's actively trying to find them
he's actually doing a public press
release
and he would be the easiest person to
contact
in the entire world in fact
i'll bet there's nobody easier to find
if you were let's say a major
uh press entity there's probably nobody
easier to find than the guy who's trying
to find you
tony bobolinsky now
when uh and watching the uh the press
uh sort of uh i hate to use the term but
it's coming into popular usage so i will
gaslight the public is really
interesting so i guess it started with
the wall street journal was going to
write an article about the
lap stop laptop stuff and they decided
that they wouldn't
because when checking the financial
records
it became clear that joe biden never
received any direct
payment nor was he on any contracts
by name for any deals that hunter did
so that's the wall street journal they
looked into it and found no
uh no financial written
records now
here's a problem with that given that
the allegation
is that something sketchy was up as
opposed to something completely legal
why would you expect there would be a
record of it
given that the email in question one of
the central emails in question
says explicitly that hunter would be
holding
the 10 for the big guy and
tony boblinski has confirmed that what
that means
is that hunter biden would be holding a
share of the deal
on behalf of joe biden to keep it from
being
on any kind of a record so
if you're the wall street journal and
you're trying to research
whether a crime was committed or
something just sketchy whether it was
criminal or not
and the entire nature of the crime was
it was kept off of financial records and
then your reason for
not running the story is that it wasn't
on
financial records have you done your
 job
it doesn't look like it but it gets
better
new york times runs an article i think
was ben smith
runs an article talking about the wall
street journal
and essentially backing them up for
their decision to not run these stories
which they don't describe in in in that
article so it doesn't get accidentally
described
and so now you've got the wall street
journal that has passed on the story
by saying it's baseless because they
literally looked
in the place that it's not supposed to
be
all right they consciously looked at the
place it's not supposed to be
and said it's not there therefore it
can't be
in the place it's supposed to be which
is
hunter holding it the fact that they can
push this story
and because of the complication of it
the public
reads it and they go um i'm not really
following this wall street journal thing
because
didn't they look in the wrong place
and you think yourself am i missing
something in this story
this looks exactly like they're just
trying to not do the story
it doesn't look like they researched it
and it was
baseless because i just saw
i just saw the guy who's a witness
talking about it on tv
does he not exist where's the part where
they talk to him
and decided he didn't have a story
there's something missing and you say
yourself so i'm not really
comfortable with this wall street
journal decision
there might be more to it that we don't
know right so
my my take on it is based on the
information i have
could there be more to the story which
would change how i'm
thinking about the wall street journal's
decision of course
almost every story we see there ends up
being more to the story
but what we see so far doesn't explain
what they did
and then the new york times comes in
with suppressive fire
because you're over here saying um i've
got a i've got a
question about the wall street journal
decision
and you're like i'm not sure i
understand or
do i have the timing of something wrong
because there's something unexplained
here
and then you see that the new york times
totally backs the wall street journal
now what do you say about the story well
if you're a reasonable educated
well-informed adult here's what you
probably think
you know i i don't understand what the
wall street journal did but
the new york times is very credible and
they seem to understand what the new
york
what the wall street journal did so
i wasn't totally sold by just the wall
street journal
but now that the new york times has has
uh
essentially endorsed what they did
okay i guess all the smart people are on
the same side so i'll just let it go
that's what you just saw it's freaking
amazing
it's impressive as hell because they're
getting away with it
and it's so good that i even wonder
if it's not intelligence sources
behind it because the the quality of
this
uh if you call it a cover-up i don't
know what you call it maybe a cover-up
the quality of the work that went into
the the psychological
engineering of the cover-up is
better than the press could do on their
own it's almost like there's a
professional
or professionals who are sort of running
the show
and i don't i i don't know what country
they would be from
so that's another another question for
you
given the sketchiness of all this you
should not
automatically assume that this is
domestic
got that now i'm not going to say i have
some information
that says it's not domestic but the way
it
the way it is developed you should ask
yourself
given all that we know about the world
at this point
you should ask yourself is this domestic
is this coming from completely domestic
actors
who just want joe biden to get elected
and that's it you know they're just
coordinating or they just know what to
do they don't need to make a phone call
and coordinate
so anyway here's an assignment for you
find a low information
democrat that would be somebody who
never follows
any of the conservative news so they
only see the the news on the left
find somebody like that and then tell
them the whole
uh 100 biden laptop story
including the email about the the 10
that goes to the big guy
tell them that there's this tony
balinsky character
except here's the twist when you tell
the story
change hunter biden to don jr
and change cnn not covering the story
to fox news not covering the story
what do you think your democrat will say
about that situation
i think without doing the experiment
myself yet
i think they're going to say that is so
outrageous
and fox news why don't they cover that
story
i think that's what would happen because
i don't think there's any
possibility that if this story were
reversed
and it was a a trump kid
doing any of this stuff you don't think
that that would be a major story
here's another part of the story that is
not mentioned
so not mentioned by new york times not
mentioned by the wall street journal
aren't we worried about blackmail
anymore
when did we stop being worried that a
president could be blackmailed
we've had a president trump for you know
close to four years and
you know the the press and everybody
else in the world has been digging and
digging and digging and looking under
every rock and found nothing
the only things that we thought maybe
there was something there was like
deutsche bank maybe there was something
in his taxes
but there wasn't there wasn't turns out
there's nothing
the only thing they found is he did some
business in china
and opened a you know some smallish
chinese bank account to do some business
a few years ago but it didn't turn out
and
that's a basically a big nothing
but you've got hunter biden who
we can be pretty sure because of the
videos you've already seen from the
laptop etc and from the emails
that if ever there was somebody who was
blackmailable
it would be hunter biden which means
that joe biden would have pressure too
because if you're blackmailing the kid
and the father could do something to
make that now happen
that's a lot of pressure now i'm not
saying that joe biden would break the
law of the united states
or even change a policy of the united
states to save his son
but let me remind you
joe biden already lost a son
that matters if you had you know
two sons and does he only have two um
there were only two right two sons but
if you've lost
bo biden and you've lost one son
and if you can imagine the the crushing
uh emotional impact that that would have
you're gonna do everything to to protect
the one you still have and so that makes
hunter biden a little extra vulnerable
to blackmail i would think
now here's the counter argument the
counter argument goes like this
uh hunter biden is the least black
available person in the world because
you already know
so much about him you know if tomorrow
you found out
oh he also does heroin it wouldn't
change anything
right it wouldn't change a thing there's
no
there's no suggestion he's ever done
heroin by the way but
you know you could you could see some
news that would be
you know make your hair catch on fire
and you would still say
well we kind of knew that that's sort of
baked in
we know hunter's a the wild child
but suppose it's financial suppose it's
financial and
there's some way to tie in the dad
what if that's still out there and we've
seen enough to suggest
that hunter was in the kind of business
where you would suspect a little bit
about
of that to be out there right now in
order for the wall street journal
and the new york times to treat this as
non-news
they have to sell you the following
belief
the belief that foreign entities would
pay
millions and millions of dollars to
hunter biden
and hunter biden's business entities
with the assumption that that would not
make any difference
to joe biden in other words you have to
believe that all these
high-level players who have millions of
dollars to
you know put into other things that
they're very sophisticated and yet
somehow they don't understand that
giving money to hunter
doesn't have any effect on joe biden
or does it make more sense that the
entire reason they do it
is that they have a high confidence it
will pay off
that there's a return on investment and
what would be that return on investment
how would how would the chinese company
get a return on investment
for a hunter biden uh payoff
except for the the hunter biden company
itself which
probably was not why they they invested
right they didn't they're not investing
in a hunter
nobody would invest in hunter all right
because even even china's heard the
stories about hunter
nobody puts their money into the the
crack
cocaine guy right and nobody does that
unless they think they're buying
something else
influence on the dad now i've heard who
said
that one of the reasons it's no big deal
it says some of this happened
when joe biden was out of office
and therefore you know he can't make any
policies anyway
oh okay technically true
but do you think joe biden didn't have
any influence
on the other politicians and the
government
do you think that after eight years of
being vice president
he didn't have any favors he could call
in
it's crazy to think that the chinese
were not
buying influence on joe biden because
that's what they thought they were
buying
you know they thought they were buying
that because they weren't investing in
the crackhead
that wasn't happening so
in order for you to believe that
everything was fine
and that there's nothing there that's
newsworthy
now i will grant you i did not see a
crime
that doesn't mean there wasn't one i'm
not a lawyer i'm not a prosecutor
but it doesn't matter does it matter if
you can identify a specific
crime on the books if what you have
identified
is people thinking they're buying
influence
paying actually money a lot of it for
what they think is influence
and your common sense tells you it is
that's not a story you have to ignore
a lot of stuff to make that not a story
you have to ignore potential blackmail
you have to ignore tony bobilinski
and his confirmation of the email and
you have to have no curiosity
about who the big guy was or who's
holding the ten
and why he's holding it you have to
accept a lot
to think that's not a story and it's
just crazy to imagine it wouldn't be a
story
if it were about trump uh here's some
dumb people
in the news axios has a
story in which the headline is so dumb
that you don't need to read any of the
article and here it is
trump has no second term economic plan
what you don't have to read that article
that that title of the article is so
dumb
that nothing in that article could be of
value to you
let me explain why you don't need an
economic
plan you know unless you're a communist
i suppose
you need a system the system is the plan
here's the system it's called capitalism
and what would be a good system to make
sure that your
capitalism system is working well
well you'd want to have a good court
system
done you'd want to get rid of
unnecessary
regulations trump do it
did a lot of it we'll do more of it as a
system for doing exactly that
you would want to let's say remove any
competitive
barriers so that there's free market
stuff in health care
health care being a gigantic part of
your entire
situation you'd want to
and of course the president does have a
spending plan about the military
which is spending a lot to make sure our
military is
first rate that's part of the economy
he wants to open up sooner rather than
later
that's an economic plan because this
pandemic is going to be part of the next
term
and for axios to say he doesn't have an
economic plan
demonstrates a massive
lack of understanding about anything
it's certainly about the economy and
what is a what is appropriate
for a president to do to manage an
economy it's like they don't even know
what it is
they don't know what managing an economy
even entails
i'll tell you what it doesn't entail any
kind of a plan
if you if one of your presidential
candidates
tells you they have a plan
you run away run away you want the
economy to work on
free market competition not a plan now
certainly it's plan like
to say you want to cut taxes but i'd say
that's a system
you know the president's system is to
remove friction
wherever you can and to make us
competitive with you know
external forces one of the ways you can
be competitive with your corporations
is you've got to have a tax rate in your
corporations
that's similar to or lower than the
countries you're competing with
because otherwise those those
corporations can't produce
cheap enough goods to sell in other
places because they'd be
they'd be taxed too much so
it is such economic ignorance to say
that the president doesn't have
an economic plan it just ignores reality
and every every element of management
and understanding of free markets it's
it's mind-boggling
how ignorant that is
all right um
the people who believe the fine people
hoax
are having a tough time this week did
you see all the coverage of
a group i think it's jews for trump
and so in new york there was this giant
caravan
of jews for trump and there were a lot
of people there
a lot of people were there with their
american flags
and if you if you were a democrat and
you would believe the fake news
that the president of the united states
trump had once called the marchers in
charlottesville fine people
while those marchers were chanting
anti-semitic things
if you think that actually happened it
didn't happen by the way that was fake
news
but if you did believe it how would you
explain
thousands of jewish americans who are
not aware of that
you can't it doesn't make any sense
if there's you know you could be the
worst
anti-semite in the world and you would
still agree with this following
sentence jews can spot
anti-semitism are we on the same page
do you think that there are thousands
and thousands of jews in new york who
don't have
anti-semitism dar you know radar for
picking up
anti-semitism do you think do you think
that they
heard this charlottesville story
believed it
that the president was supporting people
who want to
what deport them you know american
citizens
i mean it's so insane that
i don't know how to keep it all in my
head at the same time they can't live in
there
these thoughts but if you're a democrat
you have to explain that
it's like oh how and how would you
explain it
like what kind of cognitive dissonance
would you have to gin up in your head
to explain why thousands of american
jews
who clearly know what anti-semitism is
who clearly can spot it from a mile away
who live it breathe it they know what it
is
and they didn't notice this according to
your
your fake news world view they just
didn't notice
the biggest news in the country for
years
nope joe biden's primary theme of his
campaign
you know the fake news about the uh the
tiki torch guys
and and the jews in new york didn't see
the news
nobody saw that obviously the only way
to explain it
is that the fake news has convinced some
people
but not all all right that theory
is complete there's nothing else to add
oh
some people realize it's fake news and
then they act upon
that understanding and some people can't
distinguish fake news from real news
and they act on that understanding and
that would give you
a number of jewish supporters abide in a
number of jewish supporters of trump
and that's completely consistent right
it's consistent with everything you see
and observe
but if you're a democrat and you
believed in the fine people hoax
you're very confused this week
it gets better you would have also
believed that the president supported
neo-nazis
didn't happen but the fake news people
who believed that believe it did
how does that explain 44
or 46 percent african american approval
of the president's
job performance are you telling me that
nearly
that approaching half of all black
people in the country
don't know what racism looks like i
think they do
i think black people can spot racism
you know if anything you know there
might be too much spotting
to the point where maybe they see it
when it's not there
but what they never do back me up on
this
you know if this sounds racist i don't
think it is
i don't think it is at all but you'd be
the judge
i believe black people are good at
spotting obvious racism
same page anybody disagree with that
statement
because in order to understand again
you're a democrat you're trying to
explain your world
how do you explain 44 46 percent
job approval for trump how do you
explain that
you think there's 44 or 46 percent of
black americans who can't spot obvious
racism
or or this is just as crazy
they're okay with it they're like oh
yeah yeah yeah
it's an obvious racism but you know i
like low taxes
you think that's happening i don't i
think that's happening
zero places because even if they liked
the low taxes
while you would hear would be closer to
i like low taxes but i can't put up with
that
i'll pay extra taxes to not have that
guy in office that's what you'd hear
right that's exactly what you'd hear
yeah i like low taxes but we can't
we can't have that that's that's
completely unacceptable there's no
there's no argument about that right
we're not even going to have the
conversation
if you actually believed he was racist
so i would have to say that
black america and jewish america
in each case some substantial portion of
them
are demonstrating the two movies on one
screen
and it's because of fake news it's not
because of the president
it's because of the fake news coverage
of the president it's the only
explanation
it's the only explanation for why people
would be on two sides
of this whole question all right
uh i'm singing the ques in the comments
when will biden step down
you know i gotta say the fact that uh
that he put a lid on for the next nine
days and the fact
that uh you know he called president
trump
george and the fact that was it
yesterday
he was he was out in public talking and
he was doing
angry angry biden
where he just acts like the angry
neighbor who says get off my lawn
get off hold on
so biden has turned into uh
you know james t kirk's uh star trek
nemesis khan i mean i
i feel like biden should just go out
there and go
and just say i'm done just make it short
except he could i guess suppose he'd
have to say trump trump
trump and then just walk off the stage
that's all you need all right
so make sure that you watch my
bonus video that's already posted on
youtube
in which i uh
just looking at your comments i talked
to nikki klein
who is uh associated with the nexium
what you call a cult and she doesn't
and you make your own judgment about
that i think you're gonna like it
and that's all i got for now and i will
talk to you
later
