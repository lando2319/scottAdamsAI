gentlemen and welcome to
the highlight of civilization and
if you've completed the logic here
it's the highlight of civilization and
the highlight of your day
wow
that's pretty good
pretty good situation and you happen to
be here for it what are the odds of that
15 billion years of the universe
evolving
most of it's just empty cold dark
lifeless space
but where you are
oh it's all happening it's happening big
time so pretty lucky
okay 13.6 billion years if you want to
be like that
if you want to be like that
but how would you like to be like this
the kind of people who will never settle
for an ordinary day when a great day can
be had and all they need is
that's right that's all they need well
i've used a copper mug or glass at
tigger tells her stein a canteen jugger
a vessel of any kind
they would fill it with their favorite
beverage
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day
feel your serotonin get a little boost
too you might you might oxytocin coming
online tingle in the back of your neck
here it comes go simultaneous sip
i have never felt better
so you want to talk about good news and
stuff let's just do funny stories and
good news today
because
i think all the people who report the
bad news are on vacation or something i
don't know
all the bad news bears are on vacation
so the uh
it's a slow news week and so the biden
administration has confessed that
they're gonna restart some border wall
construction what
what
to talk about a slow news day thing to
slip in there and we're going to be
what we call is just patching some holes
so they're going to
patch some holes
which is totally different
totally different
than building a
fence
across a border to
patch some holes
so if you catch the difference
it's spelled the same
p-a-t-c-h
space s-o-m-e
space h-o-l-e-s right it's spelled the
same
but it's pronounced different
so
very different
trump was gonna patch the holes
and biden's going to
bet some holes
vegetables
but that's completely different than
patch the holes
you see the difference don't patch the
holes
same amount of budget
potentially
but instead you want to just
buy some holes
what are you doing with the money now
passing some holes
what
what did you say speak up a hole i'm
patching on bachelor's little patches
what
i'm patching the holes shut up leave me
alone
all
right here's a story that the longer it
goes
the funnier it is
and by funnier i mean
it's not funny
but it's funny
how many people by now by now
must know for sure what happened to
epstein
don't you think that number of people is
probably growing over time
can you think of any other story
that so many people would potentially
know the actual
answer like they know the whole story
what do you think
and and how about the whole story about
why
the client list hasn't come out yet
i'm not sure i care if it does or not
frankly it's
uh who knows
but
what do you think
or let me ask you this
what entity or entities
or person
could keep this whole epstein thing
so secret so long
who could do
that somebody says big money do you
think big money can do it
do you think money alone
would be enough to plug every hole that
would need to get plugged
because you wouldn't even know where to
put the money
right somebody says hillary clinton but
surely there would be
some republicans who knew what happened
they were just close enough to it right
is there any possibility is anybody but
some intelligence agency or agencies
there's not really any chance it's
anything bad right
oh interesting
interesting hypothesis going by there
but what's interesting about this is the
audacity of it isn't it
we kind of know because we don't know
we do know that there's no way this
could be a
um
we do know that
nothing about this
is normal
and we do know that there are only a few
ways that something this big could be
kept this secret this long
and there's only you know one entity
that's big enough
or powerful enough
to control the media on both the left
and the right
so just figure out who that is
and maybe it's more than one
organization
you know maybe maybe more than one have
to work together to get it done who
knows
greg says he keeps uh tuning in because
i appeal to his elitist sensibilities
that's what we're trying to do here
because you are the elite
i think somebody told you that recently
you are the elite they're not the elite
you are
i don't mean me i mean we
i mean we
are the elite
all right
um
if i knew the truth about epstein
i would not tell you
how many other people would say the same
thing
because that the usual suspects the
people who know what's happening in the
real world
if they actually knew the answer the
question
they wouldn't tell you
i wouldn't
i wouldn't tell you
so
here's a story that is uh
sad and disturbing
but maybe you can get some benefit from
it
um
there is a tv personality that i've
always said to myself for there is some
lucky tv personality
imagine
being good looking
being born at just the right time
you know tall have all your hair
you're good on tv and you've got the
easiest job in the world which is just
talking to people on camera
can you imagine
how awesome that would be
i'm talking about carson daly
who for years his career has been
talking to awesome people famous people
usually
on camera about music and then
well i guess it's also music
because he's on that show
what is it the something
the singing show
but it turns out that the 48 year old we
learned is suffering from
generalized uh anxiety disorder
which is basically being
super afraid of
a whole bunch of different things
the thing that makes it generalized is
not some specific fear like a fear of
flying
is some generalized thing that
they can just paralyze him
anywhere
and apparently one of the places that he
has his biggest
problems is actually just before the
camera starts rolling
on his job which i imagine was
the easiest job in the world
for him
now i would certainly understand if if
you said
man that would be the scariest job in
the world yeah because i'd be afraid of
talking in public
but
i've seen him talk in public a lot of
times
have you ever seen carson daly
look anything but completely in control
when he was talking to other people
never
the reason he's been doing it for so
long is because he's so good at it
right he's oh he always looks
comfortable
with everybody that's sort of the secret
of making that job work
but it turns out he must be a good actor
because
he's got this you know crippling anxiety
and so the reason i bring this up is
happiness is sort of a relevant relative
thing have you noticed
if you grew up
relatively poor
but everybody you knew was poor
you'd probably feel better than if
everybody else was doing well and you
weren't
right so you end up judging your own
actual happiness based on a comparison
to a stranger
or strangers
and it's just natural you know there's
nothing wrong with you if you're doing
that
so
i always find it really useful
to apply what i call the basket case
theory
to anybody you think is having a better
day than you are
do you know how many times you've
thought to yourself well i wouldn't mind
being that cartoonish guy
look at what he's got going for him
because on paper
on paper
it's pretty amazing
right if you were to do a little
checklist of you know what things i've
got working for me you'd be like whoa
okay he's got the money you know he's
got the audience blah blah blah
handsome got that working for me
obviously
good looking
uh
two words that mean largely the same
thing
but
humility exactly and then there's my
humility and you're saying to yourself i
wish i could have all those things and
also his humility wouldn't that be an
amazing package
but
what do you know about my problems
do you think you would
i mean really
if i had
somebody says anger
i'm not sure that's my biggest problem
really do people think i have an anger
problem
i would probably know that if i had an
anger problem i don't have an anger
problem
at all
i have anger solutions
that's completely different
an anger solution is when you say to
yourself i think i'm going to get really
angry for about 60 seconds
and then i'm going to break something
that i didn't want anyway
and it's gonna feel really good when i'm
done just give me 60 seconds
and then i'll just break something
or yell or something or swear or
something and 60 seconds later my
pulse
is completely baselined
now if you work differently than that
i get it because i'm not even sure
that's normal
i think it's a little bit unusual
but probably not so rare that other
people here and the comments haven't
experienced it sometimes you just need
to punch something
not a person right no violence
but sometimes you just need to break
your printer or sometimes you
just need to do something
but my point is think of carson daly uh
give him a good thought
and the next time you think somebody
else is just killing it
uh be it
um
kanye west or
yay or whatever you want to call them
today
uh or whoever
probably got some issues
probably got some issues
so that should make you happier knowing
that nobody is nobody's killing it much
better than you are
all
right do you think that things in the
world are better than ever or worse than
ever not well not ever
let's say do you think that things are
trending sharply negative
or positive
i'll give you those two choices
sharply negative
is the world trending negative or is it
trending positive
somebody said both okay
you probably
did well on your sats
whoever said both
[Laughter]
because the first thing you should do is
recognize that it's not binary for god's
sakes
[Laughter]
don't let me trap you into a stupid
binary question of course it's all
complicated right some things are better
some things are worse
but
here is another thing to keep in mind so
the first thing to keep in mind is that
you know even a carson daly can have
some serious problems so maybe you're
not so bad off yourself
the next thing is that there's a reason
things seem worse
while in fact the world is way better
alright so let me say that as my
starting
bid
the world is way better
and trending way better yet
there are certainly problem areas but do
you know why you think everything's
worse
it's just the nature of the media
the media needs to report what's going
wrong
nobody really reports on what got five
percent better
but if things that really really matter
get five percent better every year
over the course of your lifetime things
are going to be really really better
which is actually exactly what we see
but
it's not a story
so since it'll you know if it bleeds it
leads and
the
horse race sort of competition of
politics you know draws all of our
attention
so you are basically drawn to the flaw
not to the
portrait
and as long as that's the case
you will simultaneously feel like things
are getting worse while they're getting
way better
you know i always i always talk about
the golden age
and then it's sort of the running joke
where's my flying car where's my golden
age it's like uh wasn't that supposed to
kick in a few years ago
and the answer is it did
it did
in fact you couldn't even stop it
the golden age is coming so fast
it's
a few years from now you're going to
look back and say
all that happened
in five years you're gonna look back and
you will be amazed how different things
are in positive ways
examples sure
in five years we're going to be rolling
out
modular nuclear reactors
which will largely be a solution to
climate change i told you about an
invention that it's a
apparently some plentiful normal
material you can put together
they'll absorb moisture out of a desert
sky
and create drinking water and plentiful
supply it just sits there just sort of
absorbing and sprinkling into your can i
guess
so you basically create water on nothing
you know bill gates is creating toilets
that you don't even need
sewage connections to i think
housing will be completely revamped
transportation will be
self-driving cars
ai will change things in ways you can't
even believe
think about how hard it is just to eat
like we're having problems with our
supply chain and stuff but it'll be fine
supply chain would be fine overall it'll
be fine
and
even stuff like california's drought
as devastating as it is
probably something we could work out if
we tried hard enough
for example
running for governor is michael
schellenberger
who would be
a far more you know i'm going to say
progressive yeah
i'm not sure it's the right use of the
word in this case but far more let's say
forward thinking in terms of investing
in the infrastructure in the state
because he's not locked into you know
some real political
you know jail that other people are in
so
well you need somebody like michael
schellenberger to be solutions focused
because i think we're politically
focused in california that's our problem
but basically everything's getting
better
it's just that there will be pockets of
things that we'll focus on
over and over again what about the
ukraine russia war
do you think that's going to escalate
into a nuclear war or do you think the
worst risk is already over
it's probably already over
it was our biggest problem
and it just sort of i don't know
fizzled
now if you're in ukraine it's still the
biggest problem in the world
but it didn't it didn't boil into a
world war
somebody says next china
why are we focused on taiwan and china
because we focus on whatever is the
worst possible thing
if i check back in 10 years
probably the the world did not end
because of anything that happened
with china and taiwan probably
probably somehow we figured out
a way to get by now that doesn't mean
that you won't have more devastations
like you know ukraine is being
devastated
but
those unfortunately from an historical
point of view are smallish
compared to the past
when the news reports on the casualties
in ukraine have you noticed this
that when they talk about the civilian
casualties in ukraine
they're a little bit quiet about it do
you know why
why is the news unusually quiet
about the civilian casualties in ukraine
because there are very few
that's right
how does anybody even know the number
i can tell you how many russian soldiers
allegedly were killed
can't you what watch this
how many russian soldiers were allegedly
killed according to ukraine and u.s
sources we don't know that it's true how
many
what watch what watch in in the answer
is how many people know the answer to
that question
how many russian shoulders and right
the answer is around 30 000.
now that's a number that
people who follow the news probably have
in the back of their head
how many uh americans died in
vietnam
just americans
it's around 50 000 right
and how many uh
how many russian soldiers died in the
entire afghanistan
war
in russia
the russian
yeah or soviet invasion of
afghanistan
that was
somewhere in that neighborhood of 30 000
or so right
so
now here's the next question
so that that's the size of these wars
now how many how many ukrainian
civilians have died so far
in the russia ukraine conflict
and
and do you know those numbers are you
guessing
i see a few guesses here
somebody says hundreds somebody said 200
a thousand
all right but here's here's the thing
you don't know dia you don't know
now compare that so it's probably in the
low thousands
if you have to guess
or is it even hundreds i don't know i
mean maybe more people will starve
ultimately unfortunately
uh then got killed directly but
but think about the fact that you don't
know that the the reason you don't know
that
is that whoever is controlling how you
think about it doesn't want you to know
that this is a
very civilian
i'm not going to say friendly because
they destroyed their entire country they
have nothing to go back to
but
it's unusually low number of civilian
casualties isn't it
or maybe we just don't know that's
possible
all right now how many people died in
world war two
right so now now we know that this war
was not 30 000 russians few thousand
ukrainian civilians
probably 15 000 or so ukrainian military
yeah world war ii was about 60 million
that was world war ii
so in my father's lifetime
in my father's lifetime
it was
and who knows how well they could even
count it
60 million
in one war
right now compare that to ukraine and
ukraine looks like it looks like we've
figured out war doesn't it
if you look at it from the largest
perspective of history you know
dispassionately
you'd say well these these human beings
they were making their wars were getting
bigger and bigger and bigger and then
they realized oh shoot this isn't
working
and then after that their wars started
trending smaller
and now each war seems even our biggest
war now seems smaller than our smallest
wars used to be
so it looks like a long-term trend
toward less war
at least less war at scale there may be
more skirmishes but fewer
well now we do have fentanyl yes
fentanyl is definitely trending the
wrong direction
let somebody says let's let's solve the
man woman relationship fail well i'll
tell you one thing that's going to have
to change
is that we are locked into a certain way
that relationships should be
you know one man one woman
have a family and i think that's the
best solution for lots and lots of
people
but
they're going to be hundreds of million
people for whom that doesn't work at all
so yeah there's going to be have to be
some other kind of solution for
social life and sex and all that
i don't know what it's going to be
but there's no way that the current
system is sustainable
which doesn't mean that we'll all die it
just means we'll evolve to some better
system
uh
elon musk tweeted
he said often when we announce something
we hear simultaneous criticism that it's
already been being done already been
done but also that it's impossible
have you ever heard me say that
i'm just wondering if you've ever heard
me say that
yeah i can't remember if i ever made a
dilbert comic about it maybe somebody
remembers because i know i've talked
about it a number of times in
public
yeah so some of you are saying you've
you've heard me say it
and i wonder if this is just the uh the
general experience of everybody who
creates stuff
like anybody who has ideas in public
this pattern is just so consistent it
can't be done and also somebody already
did it
every time
so
i guess he has the same experience
uh axios
is reporting that teleworking is
uh moving back to the office
so you know that big permanent shift we
imagined
turns out that's not happening
for all the reasons you'd imagine
so only 7.4 of american workers are
teleworking because of covet at this
point down from a pandemic you're a high
of around 35 now that's only the ones
tell working because of covet it's not
all the teleworkers
um
and one university of chicago study and
this is all an axios today
found that remote remote workers put in
longer hours but were less productive
what do you think of that do you think
that people working at home
now and remember the kids and animals
are at home and spouses
do you think that
working at home people put in more hours
but they're less productive
yes
i'm going to say that's a big yes now it
definitely depends on your specific
situation and specific job
if you didn't have any distractions at
home
and you're the kind of person who can
really concentrate then home would be
better
but for most of us
i find it almost impossible to work at
home
the reason i have to get up four hours
before my dog and the rest of anybody
else who lives in my house and always
have
is because otherwise i would never get
anything done
do you know
that all day long people create
emergencies that only i can fix
does anybody else have that experience
all day long people are generating
emergencies that only i can fix
and they all they all have some kind of
weird time element to them
that doesn't seem to be true for any
problem i ever have
i rarely am forcing other people to
you know solve my problem
although i have to admit i did do that a
number of times this past week
because i had more problems than usual
and i did get help
but typically
oh examples examples would be
um my i'll just make one up right this
is not real
this is the sort of thing that happens
all day long
um
i hear water
leaking somewhere
well what are you going to do
you're not going to say i'll get to it
later
i hear water leaking in your house
do you know how many times somebody's
come into my work environment to tell me
there's a gas leak a fire smoke
a water leak
it's just all day long
it's just one thing after
another
my phone rings
my my people are knocking on my door to
tell me about my water leaks
all the time just that one little
problem just water leaks
it's just all day long
did you know there's water running into
the street
yeah i'll look into it
uh did you know that your tree fell down
in your front yard
yeah
yeah i knew that
i'll look at it
did you know that there's somebody
looking suspicious in front of your
house
i didn't know that but now i know that
and now i've got to stop anything and
look into it and almost all of these
things are you have to look immediately
or there's a king there's a king snake
uh by the front door what do you do
you say oh that'll take care of itself
it did you know but still you don't
really just ignore that stuff so if you
work at home you're losing flow
all day long and if you have any kind of
a creative or programming job where you
need to get into a zone and stay there
i could probably do that better at work
in a cubicle
because the cubicle has
so much boringness you might as well
work
but home is just nothing but
distractions
all right
um
cnn has a little bit of a cats on the
roof
element to it here
and once again i would like to point out
that
uh and i'll i'll ask you if you think
this is true
am i the first person you heard say this
so now this is this is now part of cnn's
site
we're seeing it and saying about the
leaked opinion on abortion that we
expect to be law
or an opinion from the court
um
so cnn says that supporters of abortion
rights are clinging to the fact that
alito's opinion
was a draft
and hope it only reflects an opening
salvo
written after the justice cast initial
votes at conference
and that
votes can change during deliberations
sometimes majority opinions fizzle into
concurrences or even dissents
other justices could be here's the part
specifically other justices could be
simultaneously working on separate
opinions
hoping to pick off votes from alito's
draft or to weaken the thrust of his
opinion
now
i think the smart money still says
that the opinion will be just what you
think it will be
you know the leak
but i am the first person you probably
heard say
a draft isn't what you think it is
that the nature of drafts is it's hard
it's part of a process of figuring out
what you think it's not always the
result of what you think
and that at their level of operation
you know by the time you get to the
supreme court
and you've got clerks who can write
stuff for you etc writing it down is
just part of the thinking of through
part because you don't want to have an
opinion
and then when you go to write it down it
doesn't work
on paper
because that's a thing
and anybody who's done any complicated
opinions knows it's a thing
if you can't if you can't write it down
in a way that makes sense on paper you
didn't have it figured out yet
so it's part of the process
so what do you think is there any any
possibility whatsoever that the court
will either
pull back or it was never really a
finalized decision do you think there's
any chance that it won't be
what do you think
yeah opinions are not law that's true
this is how the court works your take is
not unique
now i wouldn't i'm not going to say my
take was unique
but as a public figure
i think i'm the first person who warned
you
don't take a draft seriously
now you know
i will admit that the news did report
that a draft is not the same thing as an
opinion so it could change right
but
but i think i put a little more a little
more weight into that opinion that a
draft should not be
trusted
anyway i i only tell you these things um
because the nature of this live stream
is
i try to make predictions
so if i get one right or if i get one
wrong i try to pause and tell you about
it
and
your job is to make sure i don't forget
if i get one wrong
so that's where you have to remind me so
yeah it'll be too embarrassing if it's
going by in the comments and i don't
mention it
right
um
there there's an interesting story about
uh what putin thinks about the united
states
which doesn't mean that he's right okay
everybody's got their version of events
but putin's version of events is that
from the first moment he was coming to
power and really from the fall of the
soviet union that the united states was
working hard to destroy russia or to
degrade it
do you think that's true
first of all do you think putin's
characterization that the united states
and
probably europe
uh were actively trying to just grind
russia into the dirt
i would say yes
and it seems to have continued at least
through the clinton administration and
at least through the obama
administration it does look like the
united states was trying to grind russia
into oblivion
now
suppose
instead of doing these weird resets
you know where in public you say you're
like obama and
hillary tried to do
you know hey let's be friends instead of
being enemies
i feel like one of the things you would
have to do before you could do that
is to give putin
a complete
stage to let him complain about the
united states has done to russia so far
which doesn't mean we excuse everything
he's done because you know we should put
that out there too
but i feel as if we if we ever wanted to
get on the other side of this as in
ever find a way to work with putin and
maybe he's just the devil and there's no
way to do it i don't rule that out
i you know i'm a reasonable person who
knows
there are just some people who keep
pushing as long as they can push and
that's really all there is to it
but
if you thought that any of this has to
do with how he feels mistreated or or
that he feels
continuously attacked by the west
wouldn't it be interesting to let him
tell us
what our country has been doing to
russia for the last
30 years
wouldn't you want to know that
because he has some pretty interesting
theories
some of it's probably true
about what the u.s has done to him
now it wouldn't mean anything out of
context because we would also need to
know what he did to us
blah blah blah right so
if it sounds like i'm taking putin's
side nothing like that's happening
all right just to hear that clearly i'm
not taking putin's side about anything
i'm saying that if you wanted to get
past whatever this is
that causes us not to be able to work
with them that we're at the moment is
ukraine but in the in the long long term
i think you'd want to hear what he has
to say
and if you can't listen to it
well then
maybe you shouldn't trust your own
government as much as
you know as they'd like you to
um so now there's another report about
the ukrainian forces uh
counter-attacking and taking back some
town i never heard of
from russian forces
have we reached the point in the ukraine
russia conflict where everybody can be
everybody
because it looks like that's where we're
that's what the status quo will look
like let me say it again
it will be the side where
when you talk about russia versus
ukraine
both sides can beat both sides anywhere
but
it's only because everything will be too
lightly defended
russia will not have enough forces
to defend every kind of offense or
counter offensive that the ukrainians
will do right
so in theory shouldn't you see ukraine
putting like extra forces in one place
they retake a town that russia held
then russia says hey we don't like that
and then they amass some forces and they
take back that town
but in the meantime ukraine has found
another lightly defended town and they
retook it
and then russia says hey
i guess we'd better move some forces
from this one
so have they not achieved permanent
whack-a-mole status
meaning that both sides can beat both
sides everywhere
at least in that you know that
let's say that the eastern region is
taking i see somebody say no
but give me
why
you don't you don't think that ukraine
could um retake any smallish place it
wanted if it wanted to put its resources
there it just couldn't hold it
and russia could take it back
and wouldn't be able to hold it
so i see a lot of people say no
and i don't think that you're wrong
don't think you're wrong
but i do think that uh i'm going to
stick with my
prediction
that there's going to be a whole lot of
taken towns and losing towns and taking
towns back
because nobody's going to put enough
forces in there to keep it permanently
and nobody's going to stop fighting it
looks like so
i guess they're just going to
whack-a-mole for a while
all right
well
it was a very light news day
and so the best i could do is tell you
that other people have worse problems
than you do sometimes
the world is actually trending in the
right direction
the odds of a nuclear war with russia i
think are about the lowest point they've
been in a while i mean at least in the
last several weeks
i'm not really seeing north korea
complain too much
i do see the economy of the united
states
still has strong employment
when we have our uh predicted recession
in the first quarter
if you notice all the all the smart
people are saying there's going to be a
recession in the first quarter
now recessions are painful
for you know people at the lowest rung
of the economic
ladder of course
but they're also unfortunately necessary
they're cruel but necessary
the recessions are just resets it's sort
of
cleaning out the system and
gets rid of some inefficiencies and
yeah it's it's a literally necessary
it's like forest fires
yeah we don't like a forest fire
but you have to have them you know it
cleans out the forest and stuff like
that
so
i think we're in this weird situation
where we're in the maintenance part of a
you know long-term cycle
and the maintenance part is no fun
because we like the bubble part
but the bubble part will be back
we just have to do i don't know
four to five years of maintenance
yeah uh so i wouldn't be
well i'm not gonna give you any
financial advice
but i'll tell you what i'm doing i'm not
gonna sell any stocks
for four or five years
now
let me ask you this
is crypto here to stay
now that they had such a meltdown
i see yeses and no's people saying yes
are probably the people
who own some crypto
let me ask you this
what would happen if a government let's
say our government
decided to do a
a government guarantee of your balance
like the fdic does for banks
so how much does the bank
ensure the government insurer of your
bank two hundred fifty thousand
two hundred thousand i think it's 250
yeah 250 000. so imagine if the if the
united states government said
um under if you use a certain kind of
wallet
maybe they'd have to limit it to what
kind of wallet you use but if you use a
certain kind of wallet
uh they would guarantee your losses in
crypto just like they do for banks
but maybe the only thing they guarantee
is not that somebody steals it from you
maybe that's still your problem
but that crypto
i don't know the blockchain doesn't fall
apart or have some kind of systemic
failure i guess
i know would that make any difference
somebody says get out of here satan with
your government regulations you're
probably right about that
it would ruin it could be
but i'll tell you what keeps me from
having more crypto
i don't trust myself holding too much
crypto
do you
i feel like i trust myself to put money
in the stock market
or even a bank
but i don't trust myself
to navigate a uh
a crypto wallet sufficiently
accurately enough
that i wouldn't keep somebody that
somebody wouldn't steal all of it
so i would say that i'm personally way
under invested compared to what i would
be because i don't trust the technology
or let me say it a different way i don't
trust myself
using that technology it's it's beyond
my risk level
for just the interface
hard wallet cold storage i mean by the
time you get into the good technology
and you actually know how to do it you
gotta learn a lot to get to that point
you're with charlie munger on crypto
that's all just crap
young people do trust themselves but i
think young people also
don't have much to lose
you know i keeps hearing the stories
about the person who made a
you know a million dollars in
in crypto and then
rode it and mortgaged some houses to buy
some more
only to find out it crashed
so
but that makes sense if you're young you
can recover from it i mean up to a point
would you ever move to another country
yes
i wouldn't move to a country with a
smaller military
yet
so it's no at the moment
but
the thing i worry the most
is not being protected
yeah australia seems a little exposed
out there
i hate to say in australia but i just
look at the map and i'm like
you know in the short run australia is
fine five ten years
in a hundred years
australia is going to look like uh
an island destination of china i'm
afraid
all right
australia is the worst for freedom
somebody says
maybe so
all right i've got nothing else to say
today and
i don't want to take your time because
you've got a great day coming up
uh how many of you feel better because
you attended
coffee with scott adams
how many of you feel a little bit better
now
than you did
right at the beginning yeah yeah you do
a lot of you do
is there another elon tweet or you want
me to talk about the one i already
talked about
oh mark you have a birthday coming up
all right
show rocks what's that mean
show rocks
um
always impressed by your ability to talk
how many of you know
that
i once lost the ability to talk
and my greatest goal in life was to be
able to do
exactly what i'm doing right now which
is to talk to you with a perfect voice
according to me
so that was uh one of several uh
incurable conditions that i cured
by the way i keep hearing from people
that i have in fact cured the sneeze
and in at least one case cured hiccups
i did
and the technique if you haven't heard
is that if you're about to have a real
sneeze you just imagine
that you had the real sneeze first
and the imagining the sneeze can erase
the actual one
because it's just a it's a mental reflex
to sneeze there's nothing in your nose
that really needs to come out
so of all the things that i've ever done
in my life
i don't think anything is more weird or
wonderful than the fact that i cured the
common sneeze
not everyone right i think some sneezes
you can't stop like that
but
that that would be the weirdest thing
that should be in my wikipedia but won't
be
yeah so i
cured shy bladder cured spasmodic
dysphonia
cured a focal dystonia once
i got it back but i still have to get
rid of that
and
and now the common sneeze
that's a lot of cures
i've cured obesity
i've cured over drinking
i've cured high blood pressure
i've cured pre-dia pre-diabetes
that's all true by the way
you know when i jokingly say i have more
cures than jesus
it's not that lots of people don't i
mean there are probably lots of people
who wrote a book about
you know how to do something smarter and
probably
probably saves a lot of lives too
probably every doctor has saved more
lives than jesus if you just add up the
numbers
so it's not that amazing
but i have cured a number of incurable
diseases
for myself and for other people that's
just true
it's the weirdest thing
cure anxiety and you will be god i have
cured anxiety
so
hasn't you have not heard of my anxiety
cure
you want to try it right now
does anybody have any anxiety right now
that you'd like to be cured of
because i could do that
all right a number of you do so a number
of you are feeling some general anxiety
right now right
all right listen to my voice
and as i'm talking
watch how your anxiety will start to
take care of itself
so it might it might happen quickly
or it might happen gradually
or it might happen in steps where it
looks like it's less than more than way
less a little bit more but then way less
could go any of those directions
but here's all you have to do
visualize
yourself
in a simulated environment
that you're literally made of you know
digits uh just zeros and ones and just
look at your actual environment
your your walls the furniture
the screen
and just imagine that
they're
simulated and that you're in a game
and with the moment you can imagine
yourself in the game
you could also imagine yourself as not
being very important because you're just
software
so what happens to you in this game
doesn't really matter because if
something bad happens you're reborn
because that's a game's work and you're
just software you're just zeros and ones
now just
live in this imagined world
doesn't have to be real and you don't
have to believe in the simulation it
doesn't change your religion this is
just a mental exercise
the mental exercise is just imagine none
of it's real
you can do the same thing
by imagining that you're a tiny robot
inside uh or your tiny person inside a
huge robot
and you're actually behind your eyes
looking out
and you picture yourself as this tiny
little creature
inside a robot and then you tell the
robot to move itself and then you watch
it
so you're telling yourself to move your
hand
and then you observe
that it's moving
have you ever thought about how weird
that is
do it
tell your brain to move your hand and
then watch it happen
how is this even happening
how is it that my thought i mean i know
it's you know there's a nervous system
and a brain and all that
but
there's there's sort of a miracle to it
that i'm thinking and it's happening in
front of me
and if you simply go through this
exercise
of making your hand do something and
then watch it happen
it takes all the other thoughts in the
world and compresses them into just this
moment
and all you're doing is just looking at
your hand move
what i'm doing is just taking my each
digit and touching it to my thumb
which is a little exercise i did once
when i lost my ability to draw and
all this is keep you focused and keep
telling yourself it's not happening on
its own you're actually ordering each of
these fingers to do that
now you're taking back complete control
of your mind body connection
and as you're doing it it doesn't matter
what you're looking at
just observe yourself
just watch yourself moving
know that you're telling yourself to do
it
and that you're a programmable object
in a programmable simulation
and once you
put yourself in that mind
in the comments
how many of you are already feeling
more
relaxed how many of you already feel
that something has been lifted from your
chest
now you see in the comments a number of
people are feeling it already
now the reason that i have people tell
you that they're feeling it
is that there is a social contagion
element to it
in the same way that other people can
make you happier or sadder or whatever
just by entering the room
knowing that these other comments are
going by
and the people just like you
are feeling at work
will have an effect on you
because you're like them
and the fact that it works on other
people probably means that it's going to
work on you if not at the same rate or
in the same pace
but over time
and by tonight when you're laying in bed
you're going to imagine my voice again
you're going to remember it just like
you hear it now
and when you remember my voice it's
going to
remind you
that when you listen to me in the
morning
it relaxed you
and you felt that you were
taking back control
of your mind and body connection
and letting all those other things that
don't matter those generalized concerns
they don't matter
they don't touch you
they're not there
they're not with you in the room
they're not even there
they don't exist
history
doesn't exist
all those things in your past
they don't exist
they're gone
all those things in the future that you
worry about
the future isn't here
and you're usually bad at knowing what's
going to happen
it'll be fine
it's been fine up to this point it'll
probably be fine tomorrow and if you
have a rough patch you'll get past it
you
are well on your way
to having less anxiety
and already you can feel the improvement
many of you can
and on this note
i'm going to sign off on
the youtube stream
i'll keep just for a minute on locals
and
those of you who are smart enough to
stay around
are already feeling
a change
and if you come back tomorrow it'll be
reinforced
and every time you hear my voice
it's going to make you feel
more relaxed
happier
and you're going to feel that that
little dopamine
faucet in your head
the one that if you think just right
the dopamine turns on
and your whole body feels better and
then your mind
but you're going to find that little
knob
by just pushing around in there
and when you push around long enough and
you hit that knob just remember where it
was
so you can find it again
and now
you're going to go forth and have an
amazing day
bye for now youtube
you
