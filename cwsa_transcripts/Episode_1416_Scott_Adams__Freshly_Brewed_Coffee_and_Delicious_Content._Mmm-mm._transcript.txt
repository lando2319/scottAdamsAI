you made it to the right place and
you're on time
for coffee with scott adams and i think
you have to count that as an
accomplishment because think of all the
well billions of people who couldn't get
this right there are billions of people
who are not here right now and that's uh
that's a mistake on their part but you
got it right and all you need to make
this a special special day more special
than ever before
is a copper mugger glass a tinker
chelsea steiner canteen dragoflask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
watch it happen right now go
ah
did scott know what's happened
what
did something happen
uh
tell me
did something just happen and they're
broken the news
well if there is i'm sure you'll tell me
well here's some good news i was just
testing on the locals platform for you
uh subscribers
um i was testing the new live streaming
function it's still in beta
so not everybody can use it yet it's not
turned on for everybody
but the initial test this morning was
really good
so i don't know exactly how i'm going to
weave it into
my process but i'll be using it a lot
so livestream is coming soon to the
locals platform pretty exciting
i just saw before i got here a study
that came out
it's a published study but i don't know
what quality it is that once again seems
to indicate
that giving sick coveted people vitamin
d
makes a huge difference
i feel as if we're just going to get
more and more confirmation of that it
just feels as if the vitamin d
connection is not quite as
understood as it needs to be so
and
for what it's worth um that was probably
the first thing that i advised you to do
at the beginning of the pandemic now
other smart people said it too doctors
and whatnot
but if you uh if you followed my advice
and you got a lot of sun and maybe took
some supplements
maybe your vitamin d was better than
other people and i'll bet it made a
difference in your life
so axios is reporting that
we might see in the future hybrid
weddings
where
some people are attending by zoom
and other people are attending in person
i think this is definitely going to be a
thing because you can invite
far more people
and you can just say yeah you're on zoom
now one of the one of the concepts
that is very uh useful for predicting
the future
is that if you have a product that works
pretty well
but you anticipate that that product
will keep improving
until it works really well
it's not just a better version of the
product
and zoom
would be a good example of this yeah
early versions of what zoom was or zoom
became
were
kind of clunky
and it didn't work and the sound wasn't
matched up with the video and the video
would cut off
so the bad version of video conferencing
wasn't really very sticky because it was
such a bad experience but at this point
a zoom meeting
more often than not goes off perfectly
and everything is you know good picture
good sound
and it just works better than in person
in many cases so at this point
i think the the
zoom video conferencing world
there's nothing that's going to stop it
it's just going to be gigantic because
we finally reached the point
where the internet is fast enough
your your 4g and your phone 5g pretty
soon
is fast enough
and it changes everything as soon as
you're ready
technologically
yeah we'll talk about mcafee in a minute
so
here's a
question for you if you'd like to get
economists arguing with you
say anything about economics
there's no group that disagrees more
than economists
and so i tweeted this morning it was a
little bit
just to see what what would happen
um
i said maybe it's lucky we have
shortages of workers and raw materials
which is a pretty big problem all over
at the moment because it keeps the
economy from overheating
and then i said inflation is going to be
a problem either way
right so it's not a big thought and i
put in direct terms
inflation is going to be a problem
either way
but what did people say to me
damn it scott you're forgetting
inflation
no
i'm not forgetting it
it's the main point it's going to be the
same either way
but
probably if we were
i mean there's going to be a problem
either way we don't know which way is
worse
but yes i understand that
inflation has more to do with money
supply than demand but the effect on the
consumer
is that prices were going to go up
so either the economy
is functioning at full speed
and that creates a demand that's greater
than supply and then prices go up
or it's like now where you can't get
materials so if you get any materials
you're going to pay more for them wood
for example
but in both cases
you're going to pay more for stuff
and i'm wondering if it worked out well
that we have
shortages to keep things from growing
too quickly and sort of spread the
growth over two years instead of one
might work out for us it might be one of
those
unexpected
benefits that you wouldn't have asked
for but you got all right let's talk
about john mcafee
the story is
that he committed suicide in a spanish
jail
on the same day apparently that
extradition was approved to move him
back to the united states now here's the
backstory if you don't know it already
mcafee of course
made his money by the mcafee antivirus
stuff but he's not associated with that
anymore he sold it a long time ago
but he's been a fugitive from the law in
the most entertaining way possible
uh you're
not too long ago
a year or two
ago i tried to interview him
and i got i made contact that wasn't
hard
we followed each other on twitter
still do
if he's alive we'll talk about that
um but i couldn't get it done because he
required only one way that he could
communicate because he needed to keep
his his communication private
so there was one way he could do it that
was encrypted that i couldn't do because
of my setup so i never got to interview
him
and i always felt bad about that because
i i deeply wanted to
he no matter what his faults are and i'm
pretty sure the list of his faults is
pretty long i'm not going to forgive or
you know explain any of his faults away
that's for him to do
or his legacy but
my god he was interesting
uh he was so interesting
kat timf had a
tweet that was just great today and she
mentioned meeting mcafee very briefly
and spent you know 15 minutes talking to
him or something like that and then
concluded that everyone else in the
world was boring after that
i totally get that
mcafee was unable to be boring
so
apparently he had been warning that
people were trying to kill him and make
it look like a suicide
of course we're all reminded of epstein
you know different situation
different accusations of course
but with epstein you think wait
everybody knew he was going to die in
prison and then it happened
so definitely they killed them
could be
but
was mcafee trying to make his situation
remind you of epstein's
suicide
intentionally so that if he died by his
own hand
you would think there was something
nefarious that happened and it would
make his legend go on and maybe even get
in trouble some people that you would
like to get in trouble
whether they went to jail or not
so
i can't get past the fact
that he was a practical joker
and it would have been a great practical
joke
if he was planning to end his own life
to make it look like an epstein
situation
i don't know what your sense of humor is
like
but i consider that funny
i'm sorry very inconvenient for people
who are left behind and you know tragedy
for his loved ones especially if he's
actually dead
and
i thought well my god talk about
orchestrating
a big send-off for yourself
from jail
pretty impressive
but
yeah i see your comments first thing i
thought to myself was the following and
i bet you had this
uh you had this thought too
if there was one person in the entire
planet
who would have the capability and the
inclination to do it
to fake his own death
as part of a scheme to bribe his way
into jail
with let's say bitcoin as the bribing
mechanism would be the obvious one who
would be more suited to that
than john mcafee
nobody nobody everything about his you
know recent years that we know about
suggests that if anybody could fake
their death
while bribing their way out of prison
it would be him
do you think he didn't think of it
no
don't even think that of course he
thought of it that doesn't mean he did
it
but there's a hundred percent chance
that at some point john mcafee said to
himself
you know
if i could get enough bitcoin to the
right people in this prison
i'll bet they would pretend i had killed
myself
now some would suggest that maybe
epstein did that and
and he's not really dead either he was
just taken out in a body bag with a i
don't know breathing tube in there or
something and he's living a good life
somewhere maybe
but here's what i
wonder
are we going to see a photograph
of john mcafee's
whatever it was that killed him
allegedly
are we going to see that and if we did
would that convince you
because photographs could be faked all
you have to do is put some ketchup on
you and lay on the ground and put a
little makeup around your neck if it was
something like that
suppose uh suppose the story comes out
that it was a drug overdose he somehow
got got enough lethal drugs
it would just be a guy lying on the
ground
how hard would it be to fake a picture
of a person lying on the ground with
their eyes closed
pretty easy how hard would it be to find
somebody in a prison you could bribe
who had the ability to get you out
probably pretty easy
right
seems like it would be pretty easy i
don't know how many people you'd have to
bribe or how much it would cost but he
had the money
and he had the wherewithal so as long as
he could talk to somebody on the outside
all he'd have to do is say look i found
somebody on the inside
i memorize their
their
key
go send them some money and show you
know prove that you can do it
and then i'll make a deal with them
for the the larger amount how hard would
that be
he could do that
so here's my take on this um i don't
know what it would take to convince me
that he's dead
i'd have to see maybe
live video of his dna being tested on
his alleged corpse or something
but it's going to take a lot to convince
me he's really dead
given who he was and and his abilities
so
i want to mourn him
because i had you know brief contact
with him on twitter so it just feels a
little more personal
but
uh
yeah
it does
it does smell a little weird yeah even
if it's video it could be fake you're
right
all right
um
so apparently what's happening with this
whole critical race theory debate
is that when people on the right say hey
you're teaching critical race theory
the people on the left say no we're not
we're totally not
but you are
we've seen it we've looked at the
lessons we've talked to the people who
went through it you're totally
teaching critical race theory no we're
not
nope nothing like that
and i guess
this is my interpretation at the moment
is that the reason that they're saying
that is that they're not teaching
something that's branded that way
they're teaching the components of it
under different names just say well
we're learning this
and yeah we we do teach this
and this component or this you know this
uh philosophy or this history is being
taught
but it's not critical race theory
no
no no
something else
that would be like a baseball player
saying uh
no i'm not playing baseball
are you kidding me no i'm i'm getting up
to bat
but but batting is not baseball
right
i mean that's batting there's no game
there it's just batting are you fielding
oh yeah i'm feeling yeah i'm playing
defense i'm fielding but fielding
is not baseball
having a catch with your friends that's
not baseball
but are you doing it in the context of
the game oh yeah i'm doing it in context
of the game i'm playing a position and
playing defense but that's not baseball
that's just playing defense
but you also bat
yeah of course i bat
there's nothing wrong with batting
nothing wrong with playing defense but
what i'm not doing is playing baseball
do you show up wearing a baseball team
uniform at the beginning of the day game
bat in rotation with the other people
all nine of them and go on to the field
after you have three outs
well yeah i do that stuff
individually
but i don't think you can call that
playing baseball because it's you know
bathing is not baseball it's just
batting
so it looks like that's the defense
that they're gonna teach the the toxic
parts
but they'll just call it something else
and yeah we see the same thing with uh
voter suppression right
voter suppression is not voter
suppression
it's well we just made this change
and we have reasons and this changed we
have reasons
um so one person's
uh protecting the vote is another
person's voter suppression
and who's right
i'm going to say neither
on the question of whether the
republicans are trying to do voter
suppression
or are they just trying to make the
the election secure so you know that the
real people voted which is it
that's a little of both
like if you if you're taking a strong
side on that question
you're probably just a team player
yeah you're just a team player
clearly
unambiguously
anybody who wants to change the voting
system
wants to change it so it favors their
team
there's never going to be an exception
to that
no but nobody's going to push through
or promote legislation that's bad for
their side
even if they say it's good for the
country it's just not going to happen
so don't believe anybody who says
there's no
intent for voter suppression because of
course there is
of course there is but also don't
believe anybody who says
the only reason is voter suppression
because it also matters
that you know who's voting that's real
that's important
so it's a little both on that one
are you uh following the britney spears
conservatorship story
that is way scary
and certainly challenges us
to
to maybe better understand what it means
to be able to
have a conservatorship over somebody
how crazy or irresponsible do you need
to be
before you lose the right
to control your own body apparently
britney spears is not allowed to remove
her birth control
she has an iud or something and she's
not allowed to do that she can't make
that decision herself
the conservatorship
decides that
have you ever heard anything as scary as
that
that would be like sterilizing people
because you thought they were mentally
you know
incompetent which used to happen
now what about the fact that
she couldn't decide on the color of her
own kitchen cabinets
somebody else got to decide that she
didn't have the power
to decide the paint color in her own
house
now was she going to pick a paint color
that was really a bad idea
maybe
we all make bad decisions but it's
really kind of a question of who gets to
decide isn't it
and apparently she was forced to work
i don't know how you force somebody to
work but apparently that's the
allegation
and
you know i have mixed feelings one is
i'm pretty sure she needs some kind of
help
she'd probably say that herself
it looks like she does need a little
help and that she has some
emotional or mental issues that are
important but you know who else has
mental and emotional issues
everybody
do you know anybody who doesn't have
mental and emotional issues
i don't
i don't know anybody
so
just the fact that she has you know
allegedly mental and emotional problems
do you take her rights away
because that would just be everyone
everybody makes bad decisions and you
can tell when they're making them people
make bad decisions and the rest of us
look at it and say well that's a bad
decision
clearly a bad decision
but you don't get to make other people's
decisions
and as was pointed out
by others
she earned like a gazillion dollars in
the last several years by performing
that's a pretty high level of
of functioning if you can do that even
with help
so i'm firmly on the side that says uh
free britney spears and
uh if she's gonna make
bad decisions
maybe that's gonna happen
and and i wouldn't say it's a bad idea
for somebody to have a little extra
control of her big spending decisions
that probably would help her too
as long as they're reasonable
you know she could spend as much as she
wants of her own money
i suppose if she had good reasons and it
didn't look crazy i don't think her
conservative ship would change would
stop that
so i hope that things work out but it's
a chilling and you wouldn't want any of
that to happen to you or anybody in your
family i don't think
so there's a story on cnn that there
might be some kind of an infrastructure
compromise deal with the republicans and
the democrats and here's how they
here's how they
reported
on biden's complete lack of showing up
all right so biden basically did nothing
but it looks like there might be at
least a potential
deal
and so cnn reported it this way
that biden's patience paid off
what
that's the best way to say somebody did
nothing and it might work out okay
his patience paid off they're literally
complimenting him for not doing anything
he just waited he didn't do anything
and he got complimented for it well
that was
that was a pretty good strategic
decision to do nothing there because
you're doing nothing turned out to be
perfect
it was exactly what the situation called
for a lot of people would have made the
mistake
as you know being a leader of the
country they might have tried some
leadership
big mistake
big mistake joe biden knows better you
don't need leadership in a situation
like this you just need this strategic
doing nothing
so thanks to biden's
strategic genius of doing nothing
the reporting says they might have an
infrastructure deal that he could sign
do you believe that
i don't
i don't feel like we're in the situation
you know the
congress i'm talking about i don't think
we have a situation where they can get
any deal signed
with a big compromise because they were
so far apart
both sides would have to accept
something
you know pretty ugly from their
perspective
so i'm going to say i don't believe this
reporting
so i don't think that we're close to
having an infrastructure deal because i
don't think that compromise is a real
thing i think it's a fake news
but i hope i'm wrong
i've told you before that an
understanding of economics allows you to
predict the future
here's a good example that
amazon is dropping its requirement that
their employees get tested for weed
now
if you knew economics could you have
predicted
that amazon would drop its ris
drop its requirements that you be tested
and have no wheat in you
yes
because we can see that especially
companies like amazon are having trouble
hiring
and as long as there's
difficulty in hiring
they're going to have to figure out how
to get enough people and one of the
obvious ways is to
drop a requirement that wasn't really
helping much if at all probably was more
bad than good
so if you understood economics you would
know
that it was pretty much guaranteed that
employers would stop drop would start to
drop that requirement
because you couldn't compete
with companies that had dropped it
because they could get employees and you
just couldn't
so that was predictable the timing of it
was not
but it was predictable it happened
here's a prediction for you
air travel apparently is surging
a lot of pent-up demand people who
didn't take their vacations and weddings
and whatnot
and so we're seeing a lot of demand but
you would not be surprised that business
travel is way down
so despite the fact that business travel
is such a big component of travel
travel is up
even though business is down that's how
big the demand is
but you want to hear a prediction
now
don't make any financial decisions
because of anything i tell you right so
this is not financial advice it's a
prediction
and
it's one of the predictions that allows
you to test my theory that an
understanding of economics
allows you to predict the future right
so don't buy stock based on this don't
invest based on it
but let's track the prediction it goes
like this
more people are working at home
right
so so far we all agree i think it's
permanent
you know at some level way more people
will be working at home every day and
not commuting
what will that do
to your desire to travel
imagine if before you would leave your
house you would drive a distance you
would go to a new place maybe you go out
to lunch at that new place around your
work place you drive home and you get
back to your home so you'd be spending
time in a home
spending time five days a week or more
at a other location with lots of travel
in between now take that all away
every day you wake up in your bedroom
you walk down to your kitchen table and
you put your laptop down and that's all
you see all day
you're just home
how much does that person want to travel
for a vacation
a lot
a lot
so i think
the move toward more people
working from home
guarantees that first of all they'll
save a bunch of money in commuting so
they'll have a little extra money
but i think that they're just going to
have to travel
so if i had to predict i don't know what
will happen with business travel
probably stay low but overall i would
say that
the people who work for business the
employees it's going to be through the
roof and it's going to stay that way
because you just can't
spend that much time in one environment
you have to change your environment
and
that's going to be big oh by the way i
just rejoined my gym
so yesterday i went and
the mask mandate is off and checked
things out looks like they're back to
operation not many people there yet
but i rejoined my gym which is gigantic
just a gigantic
improvement in in life
gigantic
all right um
rasmussen has a few polls here i think
you'll see them in a few hours
but
listen to this so here some really kind
of shocking stuff
49 percent of likely u.s voters
say say last year's protests against the
police hurt public safety
so basically half of the country
thinks that the protests that we're
trying to improve public safety
by having people not killed by police
defund the police etc
uh half of the country said it made
things worse
only 22 said it made things better for
public safety
and 21 said didn't make much difference
so
you know when
when you hear people like me
uh
complain about black lives matter and
about the protest
your your immediate instinct is oh he
doesn't want
good things for black people i suppose
right
because if you're pro black lives matter
you think it's a good idea
and if somebody's against it you'd say
well you must be
opposed to black people mattering or
opposed to
any kind of improvement in black america
that could not be further from the truth
because how does that help me
i'm only helped by a strong economy
where everybody's doing well
that's what helps me
i'm way better off if black america is
thriving
because they'll buy things i produce
you know in just in a million ways we're
all better
but what about strategy
i'll say this a million times it was
obvious from the start
that the black lives movement the way
they the way they did it was great at
getting attention and certainly great at
getting some grievance related things
but overall it was a terrible strategy
because it was just so bad for the the
brand if you will and it wasn't
strategic at all strategic would have
been for example going after teachers
unions you know uh joining forces with
the republicans who also wanted teachers
unions to have less power getting more
school choice you could get all the
funding you wanted in the world
and you would fix the biggest problem in
in the world which is the schools aren't
uh educating people
so
um
think about that think about strategy
versus
um
the blm protest all right
49 percent of voters likely voters have
a favorable impression of black lives
matter
including 27 who have a very favorable
opinion
remember i told you that
you could get about a quarter of the
public
in any poll
to have a ridiculous response
just always
it's about a quarter of the public
just as whack on any question now here
27 of the public have a very favorable
opinion of black lives matter the
movement
now i feel like it has more to do with
how people interpret the question
because if you interpreted the question
as the concept
well yeah
the concept is great
you know everybody battering
i would say they could do better that's
that's a low bar to say you matter
should be thrive but that's that's a
minor quibble
um so maybe the way people are answering
this is they like the concept as opposed
to the actual organization and how it
implements stuff
all right here's another one from uh
for also for rasmussen
um
the opinions of black lives matter have
turned more negative since june 2020.
all right so think back one year ago
62 percent of voters had a favorable
view of the of the movement that's
pretty dominant 62
and now it's down to half
less a little less than half that's a
big change in one year
so black lives matter is failing
uh in their primary
primary job of influencing the public
that's the whole point right the whole
point of black lives matter is to
influence the public
to a certain set of outcomes
and their influence has dropped
dramatically in the last year so they're
they're unambiguously
failing
now will their unambiguous failure
as shown in these statistics uh
will that cause their total collapse
because things either move forward or
backwards
there's a good general rule of
understanding things nothing stays the
same that's important
things are either moving forward and
improving or they're getting worse and
black lives matter over the last as a
movement or an organization let's say
over the past year has gotten
substantially worse
yeah there was problems with one of the
leaders buying some homes i didn't have
a problem with that but she was
criticized for that
and
it looks like the momentum is really
toward
collapse so we'll see
all right here's another one from
rasmussen do most members of congress
care what their constituents think
what do you think
what do you think people said to that
do most members of congress care what
their statistic
constituents think
62 percent of likely voters
and about the same amount of moderates
who are the ones i look at the most
uh
61 of moderates say no
that congress doesn't care about the
voters
our entire system
is based on congress caring about the
voters
if you don't have that
what the hell is your system and 62
percent of likely voters
presumably people are paying attention
because they're likely voters right
they're paying attention more than
non-likely voters
and they think that congress
doesn't even care what they think
the most basic element of our system
that your representatives are
representing you
almost two-thirds of the public doesn't
think that's even happening
that is pretty shocking
it gets worse
you ready again this is from rasmussen
29 what here's the next question what
matters more to the average member of
congress what voters think or what the
media thinks
how do you think that went of likely
voters
29 percent think the voters are the most
important thing to members of congress
59
of likely voters
said that the media and the media's
opinion
is more important to the politicians
what do you think
do you think congress in in your
comments let's see do you think congress
cares more about the media's
impression of them or the voters
which one gets them re-elected
the media
the media is who gets them re-elected so
of course they care more about that now
if the media likes them they're also
going to convince the voters eventually
but if you had a choice
you could only have one or the other
and you could affect the public
but you didn't have much effect on the
media
what's going to happen in the long run
well in the long run if you don't have
the media on your side
you know you're going to lose support
but if you've got the media on your side
but not the public
eventually the public's going to be on
your side too because the media just
assigns opinions to them
until they're on your side
so does it make sense that congress
would care more about what the media
says com completely
it completely makes sense if you're if
you're looking at self-interest if you
look at it as an economics question
uh with or without the money it's still
sort of an economics question
uh yeah it's completely rational
behavior that they don't care about
voters
unfortunately
so uh
speaking of this critical race theory
did you see the clip of matt gates
quizzing the secretary of defense
secretary uh
austin
and then separately general milley
the joint chiefs of staff
and
when matt gates
asked
secretary austin about critical race
theory being taught
in the military
secretary austin said he had a really
good answer for this by the way he said
we don't teach it
and
we don't embrace it
that's a good answer
like if you're looking to somebody who's
like just good at answering a tough
question
this is the way to answer a question say
it's not being taught and it isn't being
embraced
and we care about behaviors not your
thoughts
and i thought that was like the best
military answer
i've ever heard
but
is it true
do you believe it
no
no we don't believe it
we do believe that the elements of
critical race theory are almost
certainly being taught in the military
i i would need a fact check on that
but matt gates seemed to have had enough
anecdotal reports to suggest something
like that's happening under a different
name
so after the secretary
of defense said no it's not being taught
we don't embrace it
general milley got to speak
and said
it's really important and he embraces it
not in those words
so
i want you to watch the clip and see if
he came away with the same
interpretation because i'm feeling
like
here's what it felt like
which is slightly different from what
happened
but what it felt like
is that the secretary of defense said no
we're not embracing it and not doing it
and that general milly said yeah it's
important and we're we're sort of doing
it in our own way
i don't think they can both be right
right
so maybe those guys need to work that
out
maybe they need to talk they should have
a coffee after that
figure out whether they love it or don't
all right here's my favorite story of
the day
and i've got a few more minutes favorite
story of the day
what happens
if you've got a friend who
uh believes in the end of the world
let's say a cult
and your friend gives away all their
possessions because they believe that
that
the world will be destroyed on tuesday
and then tuesday comes
and it's not destroyed
it's awkward isn't it
it's awkward to have a world view that
gets destroyed
instead of the world being destroyed
and
i was anticipating this with cnn who has
been claiming
that the insurrection they call it at
the capitol on january 6 was genuinely a
an attempt to overthrow the government
they've been calling it an insurrection
and saying that the intention of it of
the people who attended was to overthrow
the government
now
what problem do you see for cnn
they've been reporting non-stop it was
an insurrection
but
you've got hundreds of people who've
been arrested
and you've got a law
called sedition
in which if in fact it had been an
insurrection and if when law enforcement
looked into the details of each of these
people's participation
if they were to find that their
intention or even their preparation had
been to overthrow the
government wouldn't you expect some
charges that said
sedition
so now cnn is already backpedaling today
and they're trying to explain to you
why there totally was sedition going on
but
the justice department which is also
democrats at least the top guy
are not planning to charge anybody with
the crime
the cnn has told you
clearly clearly occurred hundreds of
people
right in front of you
right on video
with all the evidence in the world we
know the people we've talked to them by
now we've got every video probably have
the electronic communications everything
you would need to prove that cnn's
reporting was true
and there was an insurrection not a
protest
but an insurrection to throw overthrow
the country
now they get a problem
because the justice system on their team
democrats
is not going to charge anybody with
sedition
and now here's how cnn describes it
trying to
try to describe it away
they say well there are other charges
that have just as high a penalty like
obstruction blah blah
now one of the one of the claims or one
of the ways that sedition could be
a relevant charge
is if not only were the protesters
trying to
overthrow the government that would be
one part of sedition but also to stop
the government from functioning
to from doing its you know rightful job
as a government
so if the if the intention of the
protesters
had been simply to stop government from
working
that would be the same as an
insurrection in terms of how bad it was
and and whether it's sedition
but imagine somebody being on trial
for trying to stop the proper
functioning of the government
allow me to be that person
scott um
why did you go to the capitol well i
wanted this or that i wanted my voice to
be heard and i wanted pence to do this
and not to do that
and then they say aha
gotcha
you basically just admitted that you
wanted to block the government from
functioning
which is sedition
gotcha
to which i say
is that what you heard
because what i was telling you is i want
the government to work
the way it's designed
i wanted my government to work exactly
the way it's supposed to work because it
wasn't
i wanted it to listen to me and i wanted
to make sure that the election was the
fair and just election that we all
expect
indeed mr prosecutor i accuse you of
obstruction if you're trying to stop me
from helping my government work exactly
the way it was defined in the
constitution and the people in it doing
their job as we expect them and we pay
them to do
no sir i was not trying to block the
government from doing its job i was
trying to encourage
and force the government
to do its job
that's the opposite of sedition sedition
would be somebody who wanted to stop the
government i wanted to improve it
explicitly
i wanted it to be better
the same same form of government
same people i did not suggest changing a
rule i did not suggest changing the
system i did not suggest specific people
don't be in those jobs
i wanted it to work the way it was
designed and i observed that it was not
and so our system allows that when our
system is not working well we have this
freedom of speech the freedom to
assemble the freedom to protest did it
go too far
i'd have to say yes
it did go too far and i
disavow any violence that happened
absolutely
inappropriate
and i must say i've looked at my own
actions and i i would recant them and i
would have acted differently but sir
do never
never
challenge my intentions i didn't want an
insurrection i wanted to stop one
now you're on the jury
and you just heard me say that
do you have any benefit you know do you
have any reasonable doubt
about whether i was trying to overthrow
the government
or simply make the government do exactly
what the government was designed to do
make sure the election was done
correctly
right
i don't see anybody could get
in any world i can't see anybody being
uh convicted of sedition unless you know
they had some
actual planning that we don't know about
right
so
um cnn is trying to
sort of weasel out of their
their use of insurrection because the
the justice department is not going to
back it
and they've got to find a way
that the justice department really
agrees with them
sort of
but they're just gonna well for
pragmatic reasons and you know did we
tell you that the penalty for this other
crime
is is actually uh about the same
you know so so it's just it's more of a
practical thing we're not saying that
the justice department has completely
debunked our fake news for the past year
no no not that it's it's just they were
acting in a sort of a pragmatic way and
yeah we we get that but clearly
everybody can see it's it was
insurrection sedition
so
there's cnn with their propaganda
uh getting their
getting their balls caught in the the
ball washer if you know what i mean
all right
um
and arguably
arguably congress was uh obstructing
justice
by not listening to the uh the people so
you can certainly make that argument
that
it's not i who is obstructing justice it
was you
that
is my uh
is my
live stream for today
and
um i'll just give you an update i've got
some hardware coming
to try to improve my sound quality
i'm learning a lot about phantom power
and
boosting signals and ipads and laptops
and stuff it turns out
what you think would be the simplest
thing in the world
hey i've got a good microphone
and i've got a laptop
why don't i
put this microphone
into this laptop
or into this ipad and then i'll have
good sound turns out it's the hardest
thing in the world
and then if you ask 100 people how to do
it they'll give you 100 different
suggestions and you'll be like ah
i don't know
all right yes high fidelity audio is a
journey that is correct i've been on
this journey for several years now and
not found anything better than what i'm
doing right now but i'm close to it and
i will have something for you in the
coming week and that
is all i want to talk about and i will
see you tomorrow
