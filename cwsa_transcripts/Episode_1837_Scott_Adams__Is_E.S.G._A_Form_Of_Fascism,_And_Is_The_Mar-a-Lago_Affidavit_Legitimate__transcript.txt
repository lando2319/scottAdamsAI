good morning everybody
and welcome
to the slightly late
yet better than usual
coffee with scott adams a highlight of
civilization
best day of your life
until tomorrow
and uh how would you like to pump it up
a level see if we can take this to the
max
i'm talking uber i'm talking extreme
yeah you'd like that and all you need
for that is a copper gun
a cup or a bunker of glass a tanker
chelsea's down in a canteen jungle flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
it's the dopamine head of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it's happening now go
oh
god that's so good
oh that was a fresh one that was good
shall we start with the good news
does anybody want the optimistic take on
today
i got it
if you were to pick one person that you
would trust
to tell you what is going to happen with
the stock market in the united states
in the long term
who would it be
no fair saying me no no
because you know where i get my
information
i get my information from the person i'm
going to talk about
yeah the answer is warren buffett
warren buffett is still investing
substantially in united states stocks
just bought a bunch of apple
bought some other big investments yes
coca-cola bank of america some other
stuff
and
here's what you need to know
if warren buffett is still investing big
in america
he hasn't been wrong yet
was it something like 70 years of
investing
and for 70 years he's been saying the
same thing
don't bet against america
and then he puts all of his money in
america and it works pretty much every
time
so if warren buffett thinks the
economy is at least strong enough for
him to invest in america
well maybe you should too
that's pretty good news
no i'm not telling you you should invest
that would be investment advice which i
don't give
i don't give
but it's worth noting that the person
who can give such advice
is
investing in america
well here's a little quiz for you to see
how many of you get this right
rasmussen had a poll in which
they were asking about the popularity of
attorney general garland
and i want to see if you could guess
what percentage of likely voters
think that attorney general guard
garland is doing
a better job than most previous attorney
generals
anybody want to take
well
how are you doing this
what
how could it be that all of you are so
close to the exact right answer it's 26
how do you do that
how do you do that
wow
okay
um
look out for the
fake laura ingraham
quotes are you seeing them all over the
internet
so
it's is something taken out of context
so
what laura
and graham did say
on i guess a podcast somebody else's
that uh we'd see if
we'd wait we'd have to wait and see
if voters
are tired of the you know the drama of
trump and are ready for something else
so she was speculating
about maybe
the voters would have a certain attitude
at this point
that got turned into
laura laura ingram's turning on the
president
or turning on trump
now is that why you heard
if somebody says the public might be
you know they might be ready to turn the
page but i don't know
does that sound like she's turned on the
president
no
it sounds like she's making an
observation
that literally every person in america
has made
is there even one person in america who
has not made the following
speculation
i wonder if america's had enough of this
it literally
is closer to saying absolutely nothing
than it is to saying something
surprising and newsworthy
because there's literally no one in
america who hasn't at least asked the
question
not talking about themselves
but at least ask the question
are other people
maybe over it you know and want
something different
and that turned into you know now it's
like a big story
literally nothing
so here's the biggest story that i don't
know anything about
and i'm excited anyway
do you think i would be stopped by a
complete lack of useful information
about a story no
have you met me
no i'm not going to be slowed down by a
complete lack of information
i'm going to take the most positive spin
i can take and i'm going to give you my
my hot take on it are you ready for it
so you remember there was a company or
still is called wework
and it got really big and then there was
a scandal and
um
it was
liz cheney was defeated by a melted
popsicle
we have carpe carpidunctum is letting us
know
good to know
anyway this we work company
at one point it was worth 46 billion
dollars but now it's only worth 4
billion and it was some
some scandal but none of that matters
here's what matters
the founder
has a new startup that's already valued
at a billion dollars
and
here's what excites me about the startup
it's being funded at least i don't know
if entirely or in part by
andreessen horowitz
now what's that tell you
do you know enough about investing
to know if andreessen horowitz is in big
that that means something
right it probably means something right
that that's not a company that invests
big
in something that's not pretty darn good
idea
with somebody who knows how to operate
good operator all right
yeah marco andreessen
invented netscape went on to create
maybe the most substantial
or at least the most storied
uh
venture capital firm around
um
so they're in but let me tell you what
the service is
so this is
extremely
vague
but i'm going to tell you why i'm
excited about it
so he's creating
some kind of community driven experience
centric service
that would change the nature of
residential real estate
does that sound good to you
would you put a billion dollars into
that
so it's it's meant to deal with the
housing crisis
and some kind of community driven
experience centric service
to deal with the fact that there's a
housing crisis
how do you interpret that
well i'm going to over interpret it
here's my interpretation
how long have you heard me say
that the problem with home ownership and
renting really all of our housing is
that it's just poorly designed
it's not designed it's not designed from
the ground up
to meet our lifestyle and our needs
i think what he's doing is is
designing
a place you can live
that's right from the ground up now when
i hear i hear if you gave me
here's the example i use all the time
the best
lifestyle i ever had
was in a cinder block room with one
other person my roommate
in college a college dormitory with a
shared bathroom down the hall
was the best living
experience i've ever had
the second best is a 19 000 square foot
mansion
that requires a an army of people to
maintain it and takes all of my time and
every day i wish i didn't have to do it
[Laughter]
even the best kind of home ownership
kind of sucks
it does i mean there are tons of
benefits right you know that's why you
do it but
every day
i wish i didn't own a home
i wish there was some other way
to just lead my life without the burden
of owning a home
and i could afford a different kind of
home
the reason i built my own home
which cost approximately twice as much
as buying
if you've ever tried to build a house
you know it's pretty expensive the only
way you can get something to see if i'm
modestly acceptable is to build it
yourself because there's no home builder
who's building homes for
our modern lifestyle
this fits our economics and our our
health needs and our social needs and
all that i've got a feeling that this we
work thing
and largely because andreessen horowitz
is behind it
i've got a feeling that they're going
directly at the lifestyle part of living
because homes are built as little uh
let's say little containers
they're built as containers for people
oh we built a good container
we'll put you in the container
but if you started from how do you make
an awesome life
how do you create a situation where
you're you're naturally interacting with
people
in in a way that's positive
you're not you're not secluded in your
little cell
you have some kind of reason to deal
with other people and it might be
something like
for example
one of the best things about college was
the cafeteria
so the cafeteria was everything you
wanted was
free once you'd paid a
monthly you know fee
so you could eat as much as you wanted
of anything you wanted
and it was a really good cafeteria the
choices were awesome and they changed
all the time
and
i never had to cook i never had to clean
you know dishes i never had to shop
i never had to follow a recipe
and i ate great food every single day it
turned out that our cafeteria in my
college was a model cafeteria
for the company that managed cafeterias
for colleges
so whatever was the best stuff they
wanted to use to showcase
their other stuff they're doing it my
little college so we had just a great
situation
now now if you said to me scott i will
take away your
gigantic house that you designed
yourself and i will give you a space
that's got you know nice view
and the cafeteria and you'll have a
reason to interact with other people
it'll be healthy
i feel like i might go for it
right if it meant my basic needs had
enough rooms and you know had an office
for example
i feel like
it would be better
yeah
yeah it's like assisted living but maybe
yeah actually it is like assisted living
except maybe the turbo version of that
for younger people
so i like i've said i think residential
housing is the biggest market in the
next
50 years
it will dwarf everything else and the
reason is we'll have to we're going to
have to tear down and rebuild everything
because there are there are no homes in
existence that meet our lifestyles not
even close
like
housing is completely broken and it's
going to be disrupted
so are you following the uh
the berenson case
where
berenson got kicked off of twitter for
what's his first name why am i
forgetting his first name
berenson
his first name alex right alex berenson
um
so he was saying lots of things that
let's say the experts did not think were
true about the pandemic
so he got booted off of twitter but now
now apparently they're going to let him
back and there's some documentation
showing that the biden administration
may have been encouraging twitter to
kick him off
for misinformation
according to them
now
i'm going to test you here the
probably most of you are familiar with
alex berenson
a famous
let's say
uh skeptic of the government's handling
of the pandemic in lots of different
areas he was a skeptic
now
was he proven right in the end go
was alex berenson proven to be right
after all
go
comments
i'm seeing a wall of yeses over here
some not reallys don't know
yes 25
yes yes yes some knows
some knows but mostly yeses and some
people don't know
so my audience thinks mostly he's been
proven right
i didn't see any of that
are you are you sure you're not
hallucinating
because i literally didn't see you get
anything right
that i'm aware of
so maybe
has anybody done like a report card for
his for his predictions
here's what i think happened
i believe alice berenson got famous for
being really bad at analyzing data
but every time he was really bad at
analyzing data he would come to the same
conclusion
that the government was lying and wrong
about whatever it was telling you about
everything
now what would happen if instead of
being bad at analyzing data you were
just somebody who didn't analyze any
data at all
and you just said i'm going to go out
there and make a prediction that the
government is lying to you
and what they're saying is not quite
correct
how well would you do
so it's the fog of war it's a pandemic
nobody really knows anything
so you go out there and you make
yourself famous by saying the
government's wrong about everything
how would you do as a public figure
really well really well in fact people
would come to believe that you were
sort of magic
because you kept being right about stuff
except that
the way he got there is by by being
amazingly wrong at analyzing anything
that's how it happened
he analyzed incorrectly
just
study after study that's what it seemed
like to me
right so this is my subjective
impression of what was going on
so it looked to me like he got
everything wrong
but he got the right outcome
or something close to it
so it drives me crazy because you knew
that there would be people guessing on
both sides and whoever guessed right
would say that they were wrong they're
right all along it was obvious that you
shouldn't believe them
but it's sort of a trick
because either either the government was
going to be mostly right and it would
have been good to follow their lead or
it would turn out that maybe they were
more wrong than right it was going to be
one of those things
and there were people on both sides
so
one of the people let me ask you this
the people who were completely opposite
of berenson
how close were they to being correct
the people who were completely opposite
of him how close were they to being
correct at the end of it now that we can
see things a little bit clearly
you're saying not close yeah of course
i'm priming you for this answer
well the opposite would be i guess the
opposite would be that masks do work
the vaccinations do stop the spread
uh that they are safer than not getting
them
that that is good for children
that sort of thing
i would say they're mostly
at best the half right at best
right so the people on the other side
from berenson didn't come out too well
but
what did i tell you in the beginning of
the pandemic
my clearest
most often repeated
warning
everybody's guessing
somebody's going to guess right
when it's done whoever guessed right is
going to claim
genius that's what happened
that's what happened
i called that exactly
however we have the two movies on one
screen phenomenon
so we have both sides with opposite
opinions claiming victory after it's all
done
the people with the vaccine who are pro
vaccination
will tell you
well sure
you know it didn't stop the transmission
so much
but as sorta did in the first variant a
little bit
uh but mostly it kept people from dying
so that's a big win
right that's what they're saying
they're saying yeah
you know wasn't as good as we hoped but
it saved millions of people so darn good
thing we did it we better give it to
those children
and by the way
as far as i know
do a fact check on this 100 of all civil
uh let's
say industrialized countries if that's
even the term anymore
i would say 100 of all industrialized
countries
believe that the vaccinations are and
were a good idea
fact-check me
there are no civilized
countries who think the vaccinations
were a bad idea
can you fact-check that
now i'm not saying that they're right
right i know i know
i know most of you are anti-vaccination
and i'm not disagreeing with you
i'm just asking you what the facts are
and if we're all aware of the same facts
see if we're on the same page
in my opinion
i think 100 of the industrialized
countries are on the same page
which most of you think is wrong still
right
that was kind of hard to explain isn't
it
kind of hard to explain
now remember if somebody stopped
vaccinations during omicron
you know that's that's where opinions
start to diverge
legitimately because omicron's a
different level of risk
uh problem was a lack of conversation
wef explains it so you think it's the
wef that explains everything
so one one view would be that
all of the industrialized medical
communities are slaves to
what the wef or slaves to possibly
uh fouchy
because i wonder if if the american
medical community
if you got covered after getting a
vaccine you have a trigger that others
don't okay maybe
could be
could be
all right so we're not talking about
whether
any of this is true or not true those
conversations are
no longer interesting
but i do think it's fascinating watching
the the berenson
phenomenon
so
one view is that uh and by the way i
think that
uh he's valuable
although mostly wrong
valuable
but mostly wrong
that's my opinion you need somebody on
the other side of a big issue like this
and he was he did a good job as a
you know making attention on the
you know hey maybe we should you know
tap the brakes on this so i think he did
i think he was a solid
in my opinion i think he added but it's
a controversial opinion i think he added
to the process
all right um
would you like an update on the 13th
hoax
everybody knows what the 13th hoax is
right
so the 13th hoax is that
trump had
uh
any kind of important nuclear secrets at
mar-a-lago
to me
to me that's ridiculous
or at least they he knew about it
you know the the suggestion that he knew
about it
and there were sensitive nuclear secrets
and he didn't want to give them back
no
[Laughter]
no there's no chance that's true
really
people
there's no chance that's true
just just thinking through
trump had
sensitive nuclear secrets
put him in a warehouse
in
mar-a-lago had some reason to keep
nuclear secrets i don't know what that
would be
and and when asked to return them
refused
that's sort of the story we're being
told there's no chance that's true
none i mean really there's no chance
that's true
anyway
so here's my summary of the 13th hoax
and i have to do it in this accent
fool me 12 times
not gonna
fool me again
so that that's the
tag line for the 13th hoax fool me 12
times not gonna
fool me again
but i guess they are
so i saw a greg guffeld mentioned this
and i was just sort of catching up a few
days ago
historian michael bechlos
uh asked this question
on twitter
he said any possibility that certain
foreign governments trump loves
wanted american nuclear secrets from him
now
michael bachelos and this is what greg
pointed out
i thought he was like a serious
historian
like he he's somebody with some weight
right he's somebody we've been seeing
for years
talking about presidential
history etc
what i didn't know is that he
apparently is associated with nbc news
what's that mean
yeah
so
um
i don't think uh trump is selling
nuclear secrets to foreign countries
uh by storing those documents in
mar-a-lago
so here's the question
is that even serious
where when beishala says is there a
possibility trump might want to sell
nuclear secrets to some foreign country
am i supposed to take that comment
seriously
like actually
and what i mean is
is he saying something that's purely
political and we should recognize it as
such which would be fine
right you know on twitter people make
like uh
you know incredible hyperbolic leaps to
the the absurd
but if you know what it is
then you put it in context oh that's one
of those hyperbolic absurd statements
it's just sort of a political
gotcha
but is that what he's doing is this just
a political gotcha ah
you know sort of exaggerating something
or does he actually think we should
believe this
that this is on the table there's a
possibility of this
but then
i i was informed that he worked for nbc
nbc the entity most closely associated
with allegedly
the cia
is the cia wanting us to believe that
trump is selling nuclear seekers to a
foreign country
i think so
i don't know
but it would be consistent with what
we've seen from the cia
in terms of trying to affect internal
politics before
right it would be consistent with what
we've seen
ridiculous
but consistent
and you know i like this what if thing
that the democrats are doing
what if trump sold he tried to sell
secrets
what if and i thought
i like that
so
i added my own
what if i tweeted earlier what if
i'm not saying it's happening
i'm not saying it's happening
but what if what if
what if democrats are intentionally
creating more right-wing extremists to
justify their tactics against regular
republicans
now i'm not saying that's happening
all i'm saying is that all of their
actions are consistent
with them needing to create extremists
because they're not enough of them
so they seem to be doing things that
when you look at them they seem only
designed to create extremists
and i think to myself
shouldn't you be trying to reduce the
number of extremists
that being actually the job of our fbi
i thought
it doesn't look like they're trying to
decrease it
it actually looks like they're trying to
increase it
um
yeah
all right
so
i'm not saying it's happening i'm just
saying they're acting like they're
trying to create more extremists
um
here's a little story for you that
should make you feel good
so twitter
i guess the department of justice
has found guilty
an employee of twitter
who
formerly was of walnut creek california
do you know where walnut creek
california is compared to me
it's like right over there
it's like where i shop
that's where i go to dinner the walnut
creek so it's like right here
so
this guy from walnut creek but he wasn't
working in walnut creek at the time
he was residing in seattle and he was
accused of
and apparently they have evidence of
that he was giving
private twitter information to saudi
arabia and the saudi royal family
specifically about critics of saudi
arabia i assume
so what do you think of that so there
was an insider
but here was his job he was he was the
media partnership manager
for the mena region
so he was a media partnership management
manager
do you think that somebody with the
title media partnership manager
should have access to private twitter
information
what kind of job has access to the
private twitter information
could
could the
could the manager of uh
media partnerships
look at my direct messages
can my private direct messages be seen
by the
the media partnership manager
really
maybe i don't know but apparently i mean
according to the
legal system yes
now how many other twitter employees can
look at personal information of people
don't know
how many twitter employees can tweak the
algorithm to change the results
one lots of them
are there lots of people who could make
a change in their little area but as
long as it compiles right nobody really
knows
i don't know
if you told me that an employee who is
the manager of media partnerships could
access
private twitter data
i would have said that's not a thing
nobody's going to do that no company
would allow that
but apparently it
happened so
if you think this is bad news
i think you're just a pessimist
because here's what you should think is
the good news
despite the fact that twitter had this
fairly massive hole in their security
don't you feel good
to know that all 50 of our election
systems in the united states
don't have this kind of problem
they don't have an insider who has
access to anything or it could change
anything
and
i feel as if we
we don't give enough credit to the
programmers for for our 50 i guess
they're 51
different
election systems because they use
different different digital technology
it's not all about paper right
because even the paper stuff has to be
reported digitally
so all the systems have some digital
connection
and
unlike twitter and i i think some of
these uh state election people
maybe twitter should hire them to find
out how they do it
because twitter
you know you probably thought twitter is
like a big billion multi-billion dollar
company and you're thinking well they
hire the best
security people
but obviously they're not operating at
the level
of each of these state election systems
so the state election systems that have
operated flawlessly without any insider
problems whatsoever
seem to be able to do this
and not only do they do it they do it
every election
time after time so they're doing it for
congressional local elections
you know state elections they're doing
it for national elections
the
this the internal digital security
for all 51 of these elections
is tied as a
as a nat's ass as my dad used to say
tighter than a nat's ass
and
uh isn't the obvious thing is that
twitter should just hire some of these
people to teach them
how not to have any insiders working for
your company who could take a bribe or
something like that
so
it's pretty amazing so a lot of you are
looking at the negative side of this and
you should really look at the positive
the positive is that our election
systems have figured out how to do
something that twitter can't do for data
security you know what's interesting is
that
not only can twitter not do it
but none of the none of the large
companies can
um so
google can't
google hasn't figured out how to never
have an insider do something bad
but all 51 election systems have nailed
that
and standing ovation
for our election systems please
give it up everybody give it up
51 election systems with no security
problems uh no problems with insiders
doing things that we don't know about
uh that's the kind of accomplishment
that does not get heralded as much as
they should
not as much as it should
so let's all take uh
take a moment to thank
the excellent men and women
who are
working on our election systems the
digital parts the digital parts because
those are flawless
all right so the doj says it's not going
to release the affidavit the part that
tells us anything interesting about the
mar-a-lago situation
but maybe we'll get to see it because
justice watch and i think tom tom feden
uh who by the way is not an attorney
i don't know if i've ever mentioned that
before
has anybody ever brought up that point
to me
yeah actually tom fenton told me himself
he was not an attorney because i
mentioned he was once
um i just figured he should be because
he actually he seems like he seems like
you should be i don't know i just assume
everybody's an attorney
he does have too many muscles to be an
attorney
i don't know are you allowed to have
that many muscles if you have a law
degree
and i don't think i've seen anybody with
arms that big who also has a law degree
so i i think there's some kind of
prohibition against that anyway
um
so the trump legal team instead of
saying yes release the affidavit they're
saying we're just gonna wait and we're
gonna wait and see how this
lawsuit turns out
which is an interesting weak way to say
it isn't it
and i think trump came out a little bit
stronger in favor of it but not until he
found out it wouldn't be released
i think i think trump is confident that
it won't be released because remember he
doesn't know what's in there
trump would just be guessing
that if it got released it would be
somehow positive for him but he doesn't
know what's in there
do you
i do
i know what's in there
do you know how i know what's in there
because the hoax pattern is always the
same
so jack bosobic has some reporting he
has some kind of sources and if you
don't follow jackpossabic on twitter
you need to
like that he's one of the must follows
because he just hears stuff before other
people do
he's going to give it to you in a way
that you haven't seen in other places
right so that's a must follow
so
uh his take is that the affidavit is
probably full of
stuff such as
a maggie haberman uh report
in
in a newspaper
followed by some innuendo and
maybe some rumors
it's a little bit of hearsay
uh
wrapped up in
the little media smear thing where
where somebody reports on it and then
somebody talks about the report and then
you can talk about everybody talking
about it and pretty soon there's lots of
innuendo but really it's all just
manufactured
so the most likely the most likely
contents of the affidavit are
you know that right
most likely the affidavit is complete
because we've seen it it's their play
yeah it's the wrap-up smear you know the
the shift in this gift play
the the anonymous sources
the the what-ifing what if it's worse
what if it's worse than watergate
until in your mind it's true but it's
not true at all it's the same play
if
if it turned out that this was the one
time
that the affidavit was actually valid
and legitimate
that would be a break with pattern
you get that right
i ca i can't tell you what's in the
affidavit i don't know
but if
what if
if it turns out that the affidavit had
actual
solid
evidence of some kind of a criminality
let's say intentional criminality
if that were true
that would be a break with pattern
for trump-related stuff
so the the most likely is that it's a
all right um
you know i'll tell you what so kyle
becker
tweeted he's sort of on the same page
with all this stuff
he said it would be the ultimate irony
if the search warrant affidavit that is
so sensitive that it has to remain a
stay secret there's actually a few new
york times washington post reports
stitched together with some speculation
thrown in about nuclear weapons codes
being in melania's walk-in closet
and jack
basaba who has some must have some
insider information about what's to come
uh tweeted uh this is very close to the
truth
[Laughter]
that's just complete
we'll see
so um uh i guess the
fbi is raising the alert about you know
white supremacists and extremists
and there even some chatter about
dirty bomb attacking the headquarters of
the fbi and that's pretty alarming
but here's the question that i could ask
that the rest of you can't
because you have jobs and
you need money stuff like that
say this is why this is why you need me
there are just some things i can say
that other people just can't say in
public
here comes another one
i tweeted this too if your actions cause
american citizens the people who are on
your side
to openly discuss bombing your
headquarters
self-reflection is an order
and i recommend this sample question
was it something we did
now you know why you can't say that
tell me why you can't say that but i can
because it will obviously be
misinterpreted as i'm encouraging
violence against the fbi
of course i'm not
when if i encourage violence against
u.s citizens i don't do that right
yeah
so uh
so i can say it because i can take the
heat
but you can't
so
freedom of speech is really
sort of spotty isn't it
in this case i have it sort of you know
i'm gonna pay for it
but i didn't mind the price
so i get to say it
but you can't say that you can't say
that if somebody's talking about bombing
your headquarters you should first of
all try to stop them
and treat it as a crime right you should
treat it as a crime if anybody has a
legitimate threat against anybody in the
united states so first of all it's a
crime
but if you don't ask the question
was it something we did
that caused somebody on my team remember
is somebody on your own team if somebody
on your own team wants to kill you
you should at least ask the question is
this something i did
am i wrong
i'm not saying that the that they should
have done anything differently
but you should at least
ask the question could i have done
something differently
such as handled the mar-a-lago raid
in a different way
maybe
well here's something uh
that we're all waiting for a judge has
ruled on the twitter versus elon musk
situation that twitter must turn over uh
it's a hidden documents
that have something to do with how many
bots there are or how they calculate it
so i don't know exactly
exactly what they're going to get
or what musk's team is going to get i
don't know exactly what they're hiding
but they got to give it up now so it
could be that musk is going to get
information that would tell us something
that we have not heard about
twitter's bot activity
in other news
the trump company
uh long time
cio i think right he was the chief
financial guy or cfo cfo
um
mr uh weisselberg
he's gonna give five months in prison
with no cooperation because he received
benefits while working
pretty big benefits 1.7 million over
years
without paying taxes though
now if an employee gets lots of employee
benefits such as a free car
or any kind of perks those are
in theory taxable
but here's and then then the trump
organization would be separately in
trouble
for
paying him in a way that was untaxable
right so both of them are in trouble but
not trump himself so there's there's no
legal jeopardy for trump himself
just the company
and uh the cfo
but here's here's the question i ask
in a normal situation where you've got
a tax paying person and a taxpaying
corporation
if the tax bank corporation decides to
give you something
and not write it off on their taxes
i think it's it's roughly
tax
you know equal right so in other words
even though the cfo who received these
benefits didn't pay taxes
the trump organization presumably
couldn't have written them off
but if they did write them off
then that's a crime yeah it's a crime
somewhere i don't know whose crime but
it would be a crime if you actually
were avoiding taxes with that method
uh the only question i have is were any
taxes actually avoided
in other words
did somebody lose a write-off that was
roughly equal to how much wasn't paid
or what yeah
so so i'm just wondering if it was
neutral
all right probably not or they want to
they wouldn't be so
up in arms about it so remember i told
you that i was going to destroy esg
before the end of the year
my comics on that theme have not even
come out yet
you know it's going to be a while before
they come out
but uh already 39 no how many
uh 18.
uh
so arizona plus 18 others that's 19 in
total state attorney generals are
seeking answers
from blackrock
who's sort of the big entity that's
trying to force companies
into doing this esg stuff
and these companies are
basically demanding to know
why blackrock is causing their
causing the companies that they
influence
to invest unwisely when the states are
putting their pension money into these
investments
so they're basically saying esg might be
a good idea it might not be a good idea
but it definitely is going to lower the
returns of the investments
or has that has that risk anyway and so
the attorney generals are saying uh
we're investing our money in these
companies and we need these for
retirement accounts and such
can you please stop telling them to stop
making money
and maybe focus on the profits and a
little bit less on the
social good
so we'll watch this and here's the
question i asked is
esg
fascism
now fascism would be defined as the
government
controls not only the corporations but
also the labor unions
so if the government controls business
and labor
that's fascism because it's one entity
controlling all the important stuff all
the money
but esg by its nature is sort of like a
shadow government
by design
it's meant to look like a shadow
government in the sense that it's
creating a bunch of standards and then
putting pressure on companies a variety
of pressures
to make them conform to what this one
entity
is telling them to do
now it's not technically fascism because
they're not technically the government
but they are designed to operate like
one in the sense that they're trying to
impose standards
on
on people without them electing them
so
to me it looks like a pseudo-fascism
it's not really fascism because they're
not technically the government but if
you set up an entity that acts like a
government
and it controls not only business but
labor
you know directly and indirectly through
influence
it's fascism-like
it's exactly what you don't want one
entity telling your companies and labor
what to do
you want them to compete you do not want
them controlled by one entity in that
way
so i would say that esg is a form of
fascism it's like a pseudo-fascism
that's what it is this is pseudo-fascism
all right well it seems to me
that
we've covered all of the important
points of the day
and it's 7 47
well 10 47 where you are perhaps
all right
do you think many want to believe the
fake news yeah i mean the reason fake
news works is that some portion of the
public wants to believe it
so if the fake news said you know trump
murdered somebody on fifth avenue really
people want to believe that this would
be a good story
so yeah the fake news is based on people
wanting to believe it
antifa is against esg are they
oh yeah minneapolis teachers union
agreed to a contract which gives
priority to
non-non-white teachers so there's a
union contract for teachers
that says if there are layoffs the white
the white teachers go first
if there are layoffs
the white teachers go first
it's in the union
contract so
yeah there's some stories where you
don't need any commentary do you
is there anything i need to add to that
like your mind just filled in everything
that needs to be said about that story
they have an actual signed contract
that says that white people will be
fired first
do you know where that happened before
where i worked yeah where i worked so
that was you know many years ago now
over 30 years ago
and you all know my story i tell it too
often
i was told directly by senior management
that i couldn't be promoted
because i'm white and male
directly
in those words i was told that i would
no longer have a chance of promotion
until something changed and they
couldn't tell me when that would ever
happen because it would take years
presumably
but think about that 30 years ago i was
told that directly
and here we are 30 years later and these
these teachers and
the school district
are being told in writing
and writing that they'll be
discriminated against
now let me ask you this
if i would if i were to give
advice to black lives
matter it would go like this
black lives matter should go shut that
 down
do you know why
because they're a joke if they don't
and they're already you know they
already got some criticisms that are
valid i think but if black america
doesn't shut that down immediately
 every one of you
let me be as clear as i can be
if black america
isn't against that
 every one of you
 every one of you
right i'm not giving you anything
you need to be against that
because if i saw that
if i saw a contract
that said black people are fired first
i wouldn't stand for that
i wouldn't stand for that for you
you think i would let that stand not a
 chance no no way
nope nope nope nope nope
no if that happens to you
i'm activated
if you're going to let
it's not happening to me specifically
but if you're going to let this happen
so directly to a bunch of white teachers
if you're okay with that
and you you even justify it well
you you get nothing for me
you you need to fix that
that's not for white people to fix
if you want any credibility going
forward
you got to fix that now you know i know
you got bigger problems right you have
your own problems i get that
but at least in words
give me a tweet
give me an opinion
just just tell me that you're against it
you don't even have to fix it right
that's asking a lot
but i would do it for you
i would do it for you and i do it in a
heartbeat and if you try to give me any
argument about well
systemic red you
 you too far right you have to read
the room
read the room
the room wants to help
i i've put substantial
reputation money and time into helping
the black community you've seen it here
i do it publicly in a variety of ways
and you see that i take a hit for it
it's not cheap
it is not is not cheap to help some
other group
right because you get attacked for it
and
this is too far
this
this contract
that explicitly discriminates against
white people
that's too far
you you need to
you know
hold your credibility
by drawing a line there right so this is
advice that's a benefit to the black
community
i mean this to be productive by the way
it sounds like i'm just being a critic
but i mean this could be productive
if you want to get help from the white
community and i think you do
why wouldn't you
right
the most obvious thing is get everybody
on board
to recognize your situation and help
when they can
and we'd love to do it love to help
uh in fact you know i'm i'm investing
right now in
turning one of my books into a study
guide
and i've always imagined it would have
more value in the black community than
the white
because i think strategy is the thing
that's most missing
and i think it's one of the advantages
of growing up in a
uh let's say a more prosperous family
is that you get the benefit of some of
the advice and
you know seeing how things are done the
right way just being around it
and so that's the benefit i'd like to
bring to
you know lower income people who don't
have that and that's going to be skewing
you know more more non-white than white
if people take it seriously
so
it's
it's good persuasion advice
you can't maintain your credibility
if you just believe everything that's
bad for white people is good for you
that's just not the world you live in
you got to read the room read the room a
little bit better
so all right
i think i made my point
um
it's a bit woke to assume they want help
from the white community
what
is that really in question
is there anybody who wouldn't want
free help from the largest population
that has the most money
of course everybody would want that i'd
want it myself
all right
um
all right i'm seeing if you have any
comments that are worth jumping on
yes who is they
exactly
uh do you think wokeness is going to go
away as a term
i see comments go by that i don't i
never know how true they are somebody on
youtube says the first
was it
monkey to dog monkey box i don't know
i'm not going to believe that
all right and the labels now
davos
yeah i don't have much to say about that
do i believe in fate or destiny
um
well
you know i used to believe in a
clockwork
universe
where everything that's going to happen
has to happen because that's just the
way the cause and effect goes
but since i
started to appreciate the simulation
theory
there's something else going on there
that suggests that your intentions can
control your reality
now
ten years ago if i said maybe your
intentions can control your reality
all of the science people will say oh
that's crazy
but if you imagine that we're a
simulation created by another entity
there's no reason to believe that we
don't have some powers within the
simulation because they could just be
programmed in there's nothing that would
stop you from having powers if they had
been programmed into the simulation
so one of the powers might be that when
we focus and imagine something clearly
it's more likely to materialize in what
we understand to be our reality
and i think there's nothing that rules
that out and there's
at least anecdotally it looks like it's
true the people who seem to think they
can control their environment
do seem to have
outcomes that look unusually good i'm
one of those people i believe i can
control
what i perceive as my reality anyway
maybe not a real reality but what i
perceive as my reality i feel i can
control
in ways that don't make sense
by any cause and effect
traditional classic way of looking at
the world
now
i'm still skeptical enough
that i'm open to the fact this is just a
psychological artifact
it has nothing to do with reality
but it's where my head is at at the
moment
so at the moment i do not believe in
fate
i believe that we're authoring our
reality or says some of us can
i don't know if everybody can
all right uh
yeah
right a a model of reality doesn't need
to be true
it just needs to work
and what that usually means is that it's
predictive
right if you're if your model of reality
predicts it's probably pretty good
it's the best you can do
how do you practice these intentions
well that's what
affirmations are
so if you just visualize what you intend
you act and you act on your intentions
your body your brain your focus the
amount of time you think about it the
clarity especially the
in vague intentions don't have any power
a clear intention does
so when bill gates said we're going to
put a computer on every desk or
something like that
that's as clear as you can get
microsoft did okay
right and i think also that steve jobs
was a master of clarity
and i don't know how he did it maybe
it's by being a bigger bastard or
something
but
i feel in my life if i say all right
i'll give you i'll give you a concrete
example when i was designing my house
and it was time to do the landscape i
had a landscape architect
and i said i have one primary number one
rule for designing what plants and
bushes are on my lawn
they can't be the kind that lose their
leaves in the winter because this is
california
why in the world would i have any kind
of a plant life that loses its leaves
just because it's winter there are
plenty of them that don't
so i said that's the rule it's the only
rule i'm not going to over design i have
one rule they can't lose their leaves
so
a few weeks later i get the design it's
very complete and there's a drawing of
every bush with a name of every bush and
i don't understand the
latin names of the bushes
so
i can't really even tell what they are
by looking at the picture
so i asked okay
since i only had one requirement
do any of these plants lose their leaves
he goes well you know
i go all right let me point to one
does this one lose its leaves
well yes it does
and i said
what
what
what part of there's only one
thing i care about
did you not understand
and then he explained it to me this way
the plant that i put in there
for a month or two a year will have
these wonderful little flowers
you're gonna love them
and i said
yeah i get that
i get that
it doesn't change the fact
that i don't want 10 months of the year
or six months a year to look at a bunch
of branches
i'm not i'm not going to trade a few
flowers for a month
for empty branches for six months
just don't do that i said okay what
about this one
he was like
well yeah they sort of lose their leaves
but
the flowers for that one month are
awesome
and i went through this discussion with
plant after plant you know most of them
were evergreens but there were just a
whole bunch of them you put in there
now that's a normal experience
right
i'm talking about my very specific
experience but don't you recognize that
you say i only want one thing and they
and then they give you something else
like what is hard to understand about
one thing
that's the real world so somehow steve
jobs managed to
avoid that
and it's got to be with how big of an
 he was
because i can't think of another way to
do it
because i wasn't a big enough
that when my
when my landscape designer presented me
exactly what i didn't ask for
that he didn't
well he did get fired
[Laughter]
basically
he did get fired
so i don't think he expected that
i do not think he expected to get fired
but if you only ask for one thing and
you don't get it
it's game over
so
one of my problems in management is that
my personality fools people into
thinking i'm flexible
if if i were your boss
wouldn't you think i'm i'm pretty easy
going
well he's not going to give me any
trouble he'll be flexible i can work
from home
come in late
whatever i want
and the problem is that i'm flexible
until i'm knobbed
and then there's no warning
there's no warning
you you can do anything you want
you know within the zone of stuff i
don't care too much about
but the moment you get into the zone i
do care about well
i don't have any problem firing your ass
within 10 seconds
i i've fired enough people
that it's pretty easy
all right same right
so i'm a terrible manager uh if i can
confess i think a good manager
would either be you know give you lots
of warning
you know try to try to manage you back
into line the whole time i i don't have
that kind of personality i wish i did
and i'm not bragging it's like it's a
personality flaw that i'm talking about
i just don't have that
that
warning thing
if somebody goes too far i'm just kind
of done with them
all right
that's all for now
that's right i'm not a manager i'm a
leader
but i think i can't be a good leader
either because
steve jobs has
had that i will i will destroy you if
you don't give me what i want
personality
and
you kind of need that to be a leader
i don't have that
all right that's enough for now
talk to you later youtube
