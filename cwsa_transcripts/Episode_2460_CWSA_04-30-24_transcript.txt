good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams because
that's what it is if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that even
the ancient Egyptians couldn't imagine
while they were building pyramids
which we can't even do so think of that
think about that for a minute well all
you need for this is a cuper marar glass
a tanker gels a canteen Jer flask a
vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine of the
day thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip it happens
now go
well trolls you will be ignored no
trolling
today all
right um I've introduced a new character
in Dilbert
reborn that is a smug
idiot now I want you to see if you can
figure
out who I base that character
on the smug
idiot now I don't do politics in the
comic but
um but um yeah I can I can see you all
waited for the video to kick in and now
you're all happy
good good good yeah it just takes a
little delay anyway see if you can
identify who the new character in
Dilbert is if you're a subscriber you'd
have to be subscribing on X or a or at
the locals platform Scott adams.
locals.com
you smug idiot see if you can figure out
who that's based on smug
iot all right one in four people
according to new survey think they're
going to lose their jobs this
year people are really afraid of
robots so new survey of 2,000 people a
quarter of them think that they're going
to lose their job here's my prediction
for
jobs and Ai and
robots now the common wisdom is that
robots will take your jobs and then
we'll be
unemployed here's what's really going to
happen you
ready a robot will be an expensive piece
of equipment you with me so far a robot
will be an expensive piece of
equipment but not so
expensive and so big that you couldn't
turn it off and throw it on a truck and
steal it so the theft of robots and then
reprogramming them I assume
is going to become an industry do you
notice the one thing that could protect
a
robot not another robot because robots
will not be allowed to do
violence so they won't be able to
protect themselves so the obvious future
is that you'll need at least one human
being for every eight hour shift in
which a robot is working so that
somebody doesn't come and steal your
robot and since the robot can work all
all day and all night you need three
eight hour shifts of humans so for every
High productive robot let's say a robot
that can do Cobalt mining or something
something you don't want to do you're
going to need three humans to just guard
it from somebody stealing
it yeah think about
that I which part am I wrong about am I
wrong that robots will be expensive they
will be stealable I'm pretty sure
and and robots won't be able to protect
themselves right because you're not
going to give the robot a like a a
flamethrower so you have to have human
beings with guns to protect your robots
three per
robot now in reality you would have a
smaller security Force guarding a larger
body of robots but there must be a whole
bunch of situations where somebody just
has one one robot yeah let's say you're
uh you run a
junkyard like literally a junkyard you
might only need one robot to run the
whole junkyard but you're going to need
a person there to make sure somebody
doesn't steal that one
robot or how about
this um at some point I predict if you
just straight line what's happening now
that all of the jobs that have any value
and productivity will go to
robots but that will leave all of the
Dei Dei jobs for humans so I believe the
inevitable future is that all productive
work will be robots and Ai and all
unproductive work and I'm talking about
Dei will all be humans and we'll get to
the point where the humans don't do
anything but accuse each other of
racism and that's really all we're good
for because if you compare us to robots
the robots going to be smarter faster
work all day
uh no complaints no
lawsuits really the one and only thing
the humans are going to be good for is
accusing each other of being racists in
different ways yeah so probably it's
nothing but robots and Dei consultants
and everything else will be
unnecessary well you could expect that
someday in the very near future in the
dilber
comic dogbert will be a career advisor
in the world of AI and robots dogbert's
advice will not be let's say
motivational I haven't written these
Comics yet but I'm already laughing
about dogbert giving advice for the the
age of the age of robots well we can
make a potato battery at him maybe but
that's about all you're you're good
for well I like to say this as often as
possible until people accept it as their
prefer
frame the Democrats are dominated by
young people and women is that a fair
statement the Democrat Party has a big
advantage in young
people and women in particular and
single women in
particular what can we say about those
two groups young people and single women
younger single women we can say that the
uh the young people both male and female
are our dumbest
citizens when it comes to
politics now I say that not because I
think they have low iq's no nothing like
that they they have perfectly good
intelligence it's just that do you
remember what you were like when you
were
20 does any anybody remember how stupid
you were when you were
20 I I like to tell this story for you
know in case you don't see me acting
humble enough would anybody like to see
me act humble for the first time ever
come on sometimes I act humble but it
would be very rare I'd like to I'd like
to demonstrate it for you
now I have to get ready for this a rare
Act of
humility okay get ready for it okay I
think I can do
it it's going to be tough for
me the first time I ever voted in a
presidential
election I voted for Jimmy Carter
do I need to say anything else about the
level of my intellectual and political
sophistication at the time now I managed
to pick the president who became famous
as the worst president of all time until
Joe
Biden that's right my first try at being
a
voter first try I voted for Jimmy Carter
once I realized what I had
done what followed was many years of not
voting under the theory that I could not
be trusted to
vote oh I was very aware of
it I would look at my choices and I
would say Okay Scott remember you did
vote for Jimmy Carter but but worse it
gets worse not only did I vote for Jimmy
Carter but at the time of my vote I was
feeling pretty confident about
it yep feeling pretty confident I I dare
say I don't recall specifically but I
imagine if somebody got into a political
conversation with
me I might have been
arrogant I might have been I might have
been a little
arrogant so I was a smug
idiot I was a smug idiot pretty sure I
had all the answers I'm 21 what could
there be left to learn pretty done
learning I'm done learning now I'm
smarter than all the old people who have
been just sitting around and rotting
since they were 21 getting worse but now
I'm 21 and I'm at the peak of my
intellectual Powers voting for Jimmy
Carter right so you've got a bunch of
young people in the Democrats and then
as we've often uh discussed young single
women have the greatest mental problems
and it's not a close
call they have the most mental problems
by a lot what else do these two groups
have in common they can be the most
easily
fooled and brainwashed and hypnotized do
you know how people always say senior
citizens are the easiest to
scam do you believe that do you believe
senior citizens are the easiest to scam
not even
close it's true that CI senior citizens
are often scammed do you know why they
get scammed more than young
people because they have
money there's no point in scamming a
20-year-old what are you going to get a
pack of cigarettes you scam old people
because they got money right now are
there lots of old people who get scammed
because they're not quite with it yes
yes at a certain age it's pretty
dangerous to make your own decisions but
you know what's even more
dangerous voting at
21 I voted for Jimmy Carter have I
mentioned
that yeah compare that compare the
people the the young women who are
Marching in favor of the
rapists the the anti-lgbtq rapists
they're marching in favor of
them is that because of all their
intelligence and all their wisdom no
it's a form of mental and hypn they've
been hypnotized and brainwashed and and
every time we treat this like it's
anything else like it's a difference of
opinion it's not a difference of
opinion it's literally insanity and and
a low level of awareness of how anything
Works do do you think that the young
Democrats are aware that their entire
party is essentially a
RICO criminal Enterprise
do you think they're aware of that of
course not you you have to get to a
pretty sophisticated point before you
can see it all because it's kind of
invisible until you know a lot about a
lot of things and then it all comes
together
so the Democrat Party is the party of uh
the dumbest and uh least mentally
capable people and that's Based on data
I'm not it's not even an insult that's
just a description
and uh there's a study from Dr Michael
Taylor UCL economics it says that
basically your opinions are assigned to
you by the media so if you um motivated
reasoning he calls
it um people just want to agree with
their team basically so this is a an
extension of what I told you about
persuasion if you want to change
somebody's
mind the most effective way to do it I
mean it's hard but the most effective
way is to change what they who they
think they
are so if I told let's say if I took a
bunch of you know young people and I
said let's talk about each of these uh
issues and you go one issue at a time
all right abortion War taxes and you
would You' be debating about all these
things and you'd probably be losing but
suppose you'd be losing in the sense
that nobody ever ever changes their mind
but
suppose you started telling people that
they were a different
party and you just say you know the more
I listen to you uh you're wise beyond
your
ears um I really expect you to be more
of a conservative you know you can
actually talk somebody into a different
identity and then all the opinions will
come with it but it's really hard to
talk somebody out of an opinion but you
can talk somebody into changing their
identity believe it or not it's easier
it's not easy but it's easier than
getting somebody to change their
opinions before they change their
identity so change your identity
first um Phil
bump uh as you know from the disgraced
Washington Post barely a publication
certainly more of a propagandist entity
um so there's an article in the New York
Post which is not the same as the
Washington Post different posts and uh
the uh New York Post was doing an expose
on where the money was coming from for
the protesters the college Hamas Pro
Hamas protesters and the the bottom line
was that some amount of it came from
Soros funding maybe not directly but
through entities that he funded and then
those entities became part of this
protest so what did the Washington post
do when that article came out in mere
hours I think it was only 6 hours later
there was a whole gigantic fill
bump uh article trying to debunk that
Soros was involved and saying that any
indication that Soros was funding these
people was
anti-semitic so here's the example
imagine explaining what I'm explaining
to you to a 21-year-old a college
student
and they'd say all right so you know
Phil bump and they'd say who Phil bump
you know like the most famous
propagandist for the most famous
propaganda
newspaper but what's the most famous
propaganda newspaper you know the
Washington Post yeah everybody knows the
Washington Post is just
propaganda I didn't know that maybe it
just disagrees with
Trump no I mean everybody knows that so
that's what your conversation would look
like you there's no way you could
convince a young person with enough
context that they could see the whole
field they're looking through the
keyhole at
everything so Phil bump uh run some
cover for George Soros Soros being part
of that whole Atlantic group Masters of
the Universe and the Washington Post
being you know part of their uh
apparently covering for
them so there we go um there's a trump
lawyer Christina Bob who has so many
charges against her because of all the
January 6 stuff and the alternate
electors that the Democrats call the
fake
electors she could spend the rest of her
life in
jail
now that's a lot of trump supporters and
lawyers going to jail
do you think that a young person has any
idea what's going on with all of this
because young people think that they
were quote fake
electors fake electors and every time
you see that that they they tried to do
fake fraudulent electors and then
somebody will run a clip of uh the
Hillary Clinton team doubting the 2016
election and talking about their own
alternate
electors totally a
process totally a process that's normal
and most of the Democrats who are young
people and are dumb as Citizens and also
mental
illness uh they believe that just
because the news told them that the
electors were
fake that that means it was
illegal nope they do not understand any
of the
context and if there's anybody here who
doesn't understand it here here's what
would happen the fake electors also
known as alternate electors should Trump
have put them forth there would be some
legal case and then the courts would
sort it out and then they would decide
which electors are the real ones and
then we would just go on with our
business there was never any risk to the
system not even a little bit it was it
was literally just a
bureaucratic paperwork kind of thing and
and nobody nobody was going to allow
Trump to take over the country with some
paperwork who believed that do do you
think that you could run a coup with
paperwork oh we we changed the the Box
we checked we checked the different box
and now we rule the world if you don't
believe us look at the Box we
checked people we check the box that
means we run the country oh you and your
Constitution and your military and your
340 million people who don't agree with
this at all don't you know I checked the
box on a piece of paper therefore I must
run the country who is going to who is
going to accept that was there ever any
risk that the Democrats were going to go
you lost that wait a minute oh oh I
didn't know you checked the Box on the
piece of
paper okay I guess the election is over
and Trump won because the box and the
piece of paper
that's actually what the Democrats
think that he was this close to taking
over the country by checking the wrong
box on a piece of
paper like that's just mental illness
and and
stupidity young stupidity the kind
people grow out of
sometimes all
right uh here's what we need we need a
sanctuary state for Republicans is that
legal hell no it's not legal to have a
sanctuary State because the federal law
says you can't hide in one state if one
if the other state wants you you got to
give them to them but that doesn't work
with Sanctuary cities does it why can
you have a sanctuary City if you can't
have a sanctuary state so I think quite
legitimately literally we need a
sanctuary State Texas or Florida come to
mind but wouldn't it be good if somebody
who is um being charged for what are
obviously just politically motivated
charges don't you think that the lawfare
people should have a state to escape to
now they could never
leave you they wouldn't be able to leave
but uh it' be better than going to jail
for
life don't you think it'd be okay to
live in Florida for your life instead of
going to
jail so quite literally I want to see a
sanctuary state is it illegal yes it's
as illegal as the sanctuary cities and
if you want to end one of them them you
better end both of
them I I think as long as there are
Sanctuary cities that are
allowed I think there could be a
sanctuary
State you just have to assert it and and
make them fight
you all right um Elis
stefanic she just filed an official
ethics complaint about Jack Smith with
the Department of Justice um
professional responsibility group for
legally interfering with the election so
Jack Smith is being is being is the
subject of a complaint so he's the
prosecutor Prosecuting Trump for which
which of the lawfare cases is he the
boxes he's the maral Lago boxes guy
right so yeah the marago
boxes um and now uh the prosecutor is
going to be is being accused of
interfering with the election I like
this now will it go anywhere I don't
know but do you think that Jack Smith is
in fact trying to interfere with an
election oh yes very much
so it is very obvious that he's trying
to interfere with an election and it's
very obvious this this has very little
to do with the law or Justice or any of
that stuff so yeah at least I give you
an A+ for pushing this and I don't care
how it turns out I don't expect it will
go well but yes you should be doing this
this this is what we pay you for thank
you thank you at leis stefanic for doing
the job that I think you're getting paid
for appreciate it like literally I
appreciate it as a citizen thank you
thank you for doing
this all right there's a uh black
researcher was I so bad I didn't write
down his
name man I'm terrible oh his last name
is Smith
and uh he's got a thesis that DEA Dei is
racist because it uh rests on
prescribing quote approved ways that
black people should behave and
think now do you see the
connection so
Dei from one uh black
man's
opinion is racist itself because it
assumes that black people think and act
in a Sim
fashion and I had to think about that
one for a while I was like wait a minute
but it's supposed to be about
discrimination it's not really about how
you think or act but if you think or
thought or act differently would you be
ostracized yes um one of the examples
was when Biden said uh if you don't
support Biden you ain't
black now that's not Dei but that would
be an example of a white Guy saying that
black people should think the
same not
cool very not cool and the same people
who think that black people should think
the
same are the ones pushing the
Dei so I'm not sure I agree totally with
the thesis that Dei itself is racist
against black people but his larger
point that we have these set of
assumptions about people thinking and
acting in a similar fashion are very
much racist
very much
racist so that's a good
point um and one of the other points is
that uh if you're a black
academic and you write a thesis or a
paper uh it's expected that you would
write your paper with a black angle in
other words if you write the example
given was if you do a paper about
Plato uh in order to be a proper black
academic according to other people the
expectation is you'd have to write the
impact on Black America of Plato being
taught at
school like you you got to add the black
angle or else you ain't black as Biden
would say so
yeah I would say I hadn't really thought
about it but there is this whole system
of expectations about how you're
supposed to think and act if you're
black and that's pretty racist pretty
racist all right here's my Pro tip for
uh black black
people uh I'd like to give this could be
my segment I would call uh white people
give advice to black people can you
imagine anything that would be more
obnoxious that's right I'm going to do
it right in front of you white people
give advice to black
people doesn't that just make the make
the hairs in the back of your neck go up
if you're black you're like are you
serious now are you serious you're going
to give us advice yes I am best advice
you ever got that's how helpful I am
yeah um and it goes like this uh I
understand white people and here's
something you might not know racism only
lasts until you start
talking racism only lasts until you
start
talking and then it's about
you then it's all about you let me give
you the visual example you're a black
person you're going to a company that
has a lot of white people working there
your manager is white the one you want
to work for and you walk into the
situation if you walk in wearing a nice
suit let's say it's a job that calls for
that you know professional dress and you
make eye contact you shake hands you've
got a little American flag pin on your
lapel and you speak perfect English and
it's obvious that you care about grammar
and
just coming off well how long does the
racism
last less than a
second yeah now I don't know if anybody
black even knows that does anybody black
know that that the racism
disappears and in fact there might be
even a reverse effect where if you hit a
racist and you walk in and you're
presenting yourself in the most
professional you know cool
way even the racist wants to hire you do
you get that I bet that's completely
unknown to
anybody anybody who's uh black I bet
nobody black knows this I bet nobody
like literally nobody even the racist
white guy will prefer you if you walk in
and you just nail the first impression
why so he can prove he's not a
racist did you not know that
the racist wants to prove they're not a
racist so if you walk in and you've got
the goods yeah you got the job because
you solved two problems one you're a
good employee or it looks like it and
two hey you made the racist look like
not so much of a racist look I hired
this
guy
so I don't think black people are taught
this probably the most valuable lesson
you'll ever learn in your life racism
only lasts until you start talking
now I would add that a professional
appearance would help if your pants are
sagging but you're talking perfectly
that's going to be a mix
message but if you put yourself together
and I don't mean dressing like a white
person right you can have your own you
know version of style Etc that's fine as
long as it's
professional
and nobody knows
that be because if you knew that the
whole thing would fall apart the whole
di the whole everything it all depends
on the white person not being able to
judge people as
individuals how long does it take you to
form an opinion of another person 10
seconds 10 seconds right somebody makes
eye contact gives you a good handshake
looks good and you can tell by the way
they talk that they care about talking
in a professional way you're all good
you're all good suppose you come in and
somebody knows that you're uh
religious you know I don't know how you
do it but let's say you you drop
something you know you drop a hint or
something that you're very
churchgoing it takes somebody about one
minute to say what did you say go to
church every Sunday excellent all right
now I know more about you than I than I
Knew by your race see the the race is
this weird proxy where if you don't have
any other information you're tempted to
use it as the only information you have
people never say I don't have any
information there I will form no opinion
we don't do that we form an
opinion and then sometimes we go looking
for the
information so uh if you don't have any
better information yeah you might be a
little prejudiced you might be a big it
but the moment you open your mouth all
gone it's the magic trick of white
people if you want to manipulate white
people to get what you
want show up on
time good handshake eye contact dress
well speak well say what you're going to
do for the company you'll get every job
every job you'll never even not get an
offer I mean basically it's that
easy so there's your pro
tip um from a white guy giving advice to
black
people it's by the way that's the most
useful thing you'll ever hear if you're
black literally it will be the most
useful thing you will ever hear if
you're
black all right Nancy py was on MSNBC
and a funny viral moment happened so she
was talking to M NBC's ktie
tur um and py said Donald Trump has the
worst record of job losses of any
president and then Katie tur just sort
of in a low voice just sort of slips
in there was a global
pandemic
Pelosi she freezes her eyes become
saucers because she doesn't believe
what's happening to her that she's on
MSNBC and she just got called out for
the biggest lie the Democrats are
telling lately that that Joe Biden was
good for jobs when really it was just
coming off of a pandemic that's all it
was and what did Pelosi do she repeated
it like you're not supposed to say
that Trump lost jobs and Biden gained
them and and it looked like she was
literally going to like her head was
going to
explode and then finally Pelosi attacked
attacked Katie tur she says if you want
to be an apologist for Donald Trump that
may be your role but it ain't
mine an apologist all she did was add
the context that you were coming out of
a
pandemic Now isn't that context a little
bit important a little bit relevant like
it would be the news like it would be
ktie tur's entire point and then it gets
worse
by the way here's the part of the story
if you saw this story this is the part
you didn't see then Katie tur says after
being called an apologist for Donald
Trump she said something like well you
know that nobody would ever call me
that in other words Katie tur's
defense was that she's
anti-trump on the
news so not only did Nancy Pelosi
completely reveal that she's expecting
them to to basically just agree with
whatever she says but then Katie
tur basically confesses that she doesn't
plan to be fair because you nobody would
call her prot
Trump the the entire uh Democrat machine
is just falling apart and it's
glorious uh the white house uh
officially claims I think this was the
uh
was this a daily wire somebody did this
uh but the uh White House has corrected
Biden 148 times during
20124 148 times so 148 times he said
something that was incorrect and after
the fact they had to you know issue a
clarification 148 times in
2024 the year is
new
so got that working for him
uh here's a question have you wondered
why the Big Wall Street firms were
buying all these private residents you
ever wonder that and then I read the
news about why they're doing it and it
says they're doing it to rent them
out so that these gigantic entities like
you Black Rock and others uh are buying
all these like one in four new homes are
being bought by these big entities it
says it's to rent them out do you
believe
that do you believe that they think
that's a good business model to buy a
new house and rent it out let me tell
you something that I know because I have
a degree in economics and maybe you
don't that's not a thing you can't buy a
new house and make money renting it
out you all know that right but this is
the news the news just told me they're
buying them to rent them out now they
are renting them out but don't you think
the story should include that there's no
way to make money doing that do you
think you could go buy a new house and
rent it out and make money no they're
price so you can't do that there's no
way in the world our our rents are
completely on a whack with the home
purchase you can't buy a new house and
rent it and make money but the news is
telling you you can do you know why they
told you that because they don't know
anything about economics they don't know
anything about business that's not a
business model so why are they doing it
why why are the biggest smartest people
the richest people buying tons of
private
residence it's not to rent
it there is a
reason okay you're right asset storage
exactly it's a it's an inflation Edge
because if inflation is not in control
your money will become worthless but
your houses will go up in value probably
at least keeping up with inflation and
that's what's happened so far so no it's
not about renting out the houses it's
because they think your dollar will
become worthless but so people still
have to live
someplace yeah it's uh it's the worst
case scenario that the smartest people
think that money will become worthless
basically they would put it in financial
instruments if they believed otherwise
so that's what that's all about I think
I mean unless somebody has a better idea
those of you who know economics agree
with me right is there anybody who knows
this field who
disagrees that it's not about renting
them I mean renting them is better than
not renting them but it's all about just
not losing money to inflation I
think all right
um MSNBC is Nicole Wallace had a uh bad
crazy moment where she went all
wide-eyed and that saucery liar thing
and said that uh if Donald Trump wins in
November there might not be a White
House correspondence dinner or a free
press That's Right Donald Trump is going
to end the White House Correspondence
Dinner how how in the world can our
Republic
survive not having a dress up dinner
where the people the Press are supposed
to be covering objectively have with
them and and have a lot of jokes with
them yeah that that would be the end of
democracy if you couldn't have that one
dinner what but also that he would get
rid of the Free
Press um have you noticed that the
argument in favor of Biden is now so
bankrupt that all they have left is
putting words
together literally uh how's he doing on
the economy versus Trump oh terrible
immigration versus Trump terrible uh who
had the better performance as president
he's looking terrible you go right down
the
line and Biden looks like a disaster so
the only thing you could come up with
are things that you can concoct out of
nothing with
words and
ifs if if Trump gets elected aliens from
the nebula 6 will attack
and kill us all so whatever you do don't
don't vote for that Trump because the
aliens will attack because that's true
because the words make sentences that
make
sense look watch me put some words
together Trump will steal your
democracy there look at that I put words
together watch me do it
again Trump will uh shoot somebody on
Fifth Avenue maybe all of you he'll
shoot you all on Fifth Avenue
that's all they have batshit crazy women
with big saucer eyes scaring you with
words oh he got to take away our Free
Press my democracy is going
away yep good mental health
there well did you know this James
Freeman at the W Street Journal opinion
piece uh tells us that uh there are more
never Biden voters than never
trumpers
substantially there are more never
bidens than never trumpers have you ever
heard the phrase never Biden
nope nope have you ever heard the phrase
a never Trump voter every single day why
is that when there are more people who
say they would never vote for Biden than
Trump well it's exactly why you think it
is because the Press is illegitimate
my favorite story that's not yet
confirmed but it's looking interesting
is about the maralago boxes and Julie
Kelly's all over this reporting on it
and so apparently there was some boxes
that the GSA packed and had in their own
possession that were not yet at marago
that the GSA kept trying to get the
Trump organization to take possession of
now the interest
question is could it be that the ones
that the GSA had and they tried to make
Trump take were the problem ones is it
possible that if there are any
classified documents at all and I'm not
sure about that that all of them are in
the ones that the GSA packed for him and
then suspiciously forced him to
take it's a little bit suspicious like a
setup now if we had never ever seen the
uh Russia collusion
hoax it' be hard to imagine that the
government could run a setup like that
if RFK Jr were not claiming to know with
certainty that his uncle was murdered by
the CIA in a elaborate plot well you
wouldn't think it's some kind of setup
if you hadn't seen 50 former and current
Intel people put a letter together that
they knew was fake saying that it looked
like Russian interference if we' never
seen that then we would now think well
the government can't do these massive
coordinated you know frauds sure they
can if we never live through the
pandemic do I need to say more about
that you wouldn't think that the
government could pull off a massive
Global fraud sure they can if we didn't
know about the Gulf of tonen you'd never
think that the government could start a
whole War over something they made up
yes they can yes they can what about
yeah so so you go right down the list
and you see that the Democrats uh do
have a pretty good history of doing
setups if you look at the lawfare
against Trump I would say all of that
looks
illegitimate so would it be unusual and
out of the normal for the GSA to have
set up Trump by stuffing things in those
boxes no unfortunately that would be
right down the middle of what is
normal wouldn't you love to say that
wasn't normal wouldn't you love to say
Scott you know if you make an
extraordinary claim like that you better
have extraordinary proof right Carl San
an extraordinary claim requires
extraordinary proof I don't have any
extraordinary
proof but this is not an extraordinary
claim this is a claim claim that things
are working in this case the mar Lago
boxes exactly the way everything else
worked
fraudulently the claim is that this was
fraudulent and my claim is that would
make it like every other thing in the
news just the same you do not need
extraordinary uh proof for an ordinary
event and that would be very ordinary
sadly it' be ordinary
well zubie is uh weighing in on the
question of young men having a lot less
sex he was looking at a graph and he he
interpreted it this way he said that so
basically a lot more men are virgins
than young women and He suggests that it
means a lot of young women are sleeping
with the same men which of course they
are you know the high value men H but
also older
men and
and I think both of those are true let
me tell you something that I've heard
many times as an older man during my uh
during my times that I've been single
one of the most common things I hear is
that younger women can't stand men their
age can't just can't stand them and that
they're looking for somebody who they
don't say this but maybe he reminded
them of their dad a little bit more
you know a little bit more classically
male you know what I mean a little less
uh sensitive A Little Less AFF feminite
little less
Beta And there are a lot of young women
who have figured out that the only way
to find one a man who meets that
standard that maybe they picked up from
their parents is an older guy so it's
definitely a thing and and I can tell
and obviously money has something to do
with it too I wouldn't I wouldn't ignore
that but no there's in addition to the
money um there is very much a preference
for older people I I'll tell you years
ago many years
ago there was a uh I was seeing a much
younger woman nobody you've ever heard
of so not anybody I married nobody ever
heard of and uh I broke up with her
because I didn't think she should be
with somebody my age
this was quite a while ago but I was
substantially older and I didn't think
it was good for her so even though
things were fine I broke it up because I
thought you I can't do this to her I
don't want her to waste her young young
years on somebody that doesn't make
sense she broke up with me and her next
boyfriend was several years older than
me and she married him and it was great
marriage you he passed away way
eventually CU he was older um but uh
they did not get divorced and as far as
I can tell it was a perfectly happy
marriage the entire way you know except
for one of them goes goes too soon but I
don't think that was
unusual I I think that there there
are there is a fairly large percentage
of young women who just can't stand
young men that's a real
thing um yeah
and and then and then the case I
explained it wasn't about the money at
all um I mean there was no indication of
it
whatsoever
um Soh Christopher rufo is having fun
with these college protests because it
works very well for his messaging and he
says that uh the right the political
right should let the the college thing
run out just let it run because every
day that there's a protest on the
college and it looks like a bunch of
crazy liberals it makes the
conservatives look
good and so the last thing the
conservatives you want to do is stop it
because it's the Liberals eating the
liberals so it's basically driving a
wedge in the left so even if the people
on the right could do something
productive I don't think they can I mean
what what can you do I mean what are you
going to do really it's the left versus
the left I mean you're basically just
watching if you're on the right but uh
rufo is saying that uh it's great
because the left is tearing itself apart
and the longer the encampment stay the
more the left will fracture I believe he
is right about
that one of the funniest story is as the
Pentagon says it can't calculate how
much they're spending for University
training because Congress defunded their
Dei offices The Daily Caller is
reporting this um so the Pentagon told
Congress it could not provide the
required accounting of diversity
training uh just didn't have enough
people working in Dei to do the
accounting for how many people are
working in Dei and what they're
spending now is that the perfect Dilbert
story oh it will be a Dilbert
the dilbur Pentagon we don't have enough
Dei
people to do the accounting for how much
we were spending on Dei people oh that's
a real thing yep that's a real
thing and then uh what What entity was
it the other day was it a company or a
university had 177 people under Dei
staff can you imagine being any
organization that has 177 people under
your Dei staff just
Dei and as as I commented that seemed
like a lethal dose oh it was a I think
it was a medical school or something I
don't know
um
yeah
so that would be a lethal dose of Dei in
a related story uh the government your
federal government is looking at uh
opening up some shuttered nuclear power
plants and a Federal Energy official
said that there are a number of them two
in particular but there might be more
that could be unshuttered and reopened
because nuclear is good clean
energy do you know what the problem with
that
is suppose you had a shuddered nuclear
power
plant uh what are the chances you can
hire back all the people who work there
in the first place none because time has
gone people are retired they moved right
you're not going to be able to hire the
old staff back so what are you going to
do you're going to have to hire new
people and let's say you start this
program that's going to cost you I don't
know 10 billion dollars to reopen a nuke
it's going to be billions but let's just
say 10 billion you're going to spend 10
billion on it and all you need to do to
make it successful is hire good people
but because of
Dei you have to hire
diversity but because of supply and
demand and the numbers and this has
nothing to do with anybody's genetics or
race or their culture has nothing to do
with their
gender there shouldn't be enough people
to hire who are qualified and also hit
the Dei Mark so you're going to put $10
billion into it are you going to say
wow uh thanks for the $10 billion but we
can't open this after all because we
can't hire enough people who are both
diverse and
qualified do you think that's going to
happen no not in any world will that
happen in the real world here's what
happens they take the 10 billion because
of course you take the 10
billion you hire as many qualified
people as you can because of course you
want to hire qualified people and then
you quick run out and you say oh shoot I
got to I got to fill this with bodies
around so I don't get my 10 billion of
which I'm keeping part of it and so you
say well this person isn't exactly
qualified but maybe we could train him
on the job and then well this one isn't
as qualified as he used to be in the old
days but I really need this diversity so
I'm going to take my
chances how much of that do you think
will happen before there's a nuclear
meltdown literally just because they
can't get access to a pipeline of
qualified people and again nothing to do
with anybody's race nothing to do with
genes nothing to do with culture or
gender or lgbtq none of that none of it
has anything to do with this
conversation it's just thr
enough just not enough so I would say
that we should put this on hold as long
as Dei is still still the dominant
Factor you can have the you can reopen a
nuke I like that
idea or you can have
Dei but don't tell me you can do both
because we know you can't and if you're
going to Dei me some nuclear power
plants no thank you I'd rather sit in
the dark than believe that my Nuclear
Power Plant was insufficiently staffed
just because there was a shortage of
people who were qualified nothing to do
with your genes nothing to do with your
culture nothing to do with your
gender I just have to say that every
five seconds so yeah I I'm not in favor
of reopening these nukes while Dei is
also active I think if the government
says you can't have Dei in a nuclear
facility then I'm all
in but if it's legal to have a Dei group
and you're hiring for your nuclear
facility I don't want to near me and I'm
very pro- Nuclear by the way but I mean
I mean let's be reasonable you just
don't combine Dei and nuclear power you
just don't and if they're going to do it
I'm out I can't support
that um well Trump continues to look
better than Mor is and of office so now
just over half of Americans say they
support Mass deportation can you even
just hold that in your
head how is that how in the world is
this election going to be close
half of the people are now in favor of
Trump's most radical idea his most
offensive radical idea it was the entire
reason he got you know branded as a
racist and now it's sort of standard
opinion do you know what else could
happen between now and election
day there could be a terrorist
event that's because of somebody who
came through over the
border now now I'm not predicting
it but it's definitely in the
possibility set you know given what's
happening with Iran and Hamas and all
that the odds that at least one
terrorist got
through the border and at least one of
them is going to do something bad
between now and election day is pretty
good I would say it's a
solid 30 or 40%
odds it's pretty high right cuz normally
your odds of a terror attack would be
you much lower
now I think the reason we haven't had
more terror attacks in the United States
is because we have zero
privacy and that the government is just
scooping up every conversation
everybody's having everywhere and they
just absolutely know who's going to do a
nucle who's going to do a terrorist
attack I think the government doesn't
want us to know how good they are at
stopping terrorism because I think they
can basically catch at all at this point
just by just by taking away all of our
privacy but not our
democracy which was already taken away a
long time
ago all right ladies and gentlemen I
would like to offer you some positivity
to get your day going anybody want some
positivity all right here it comes
everything that's happening right now
that looks bad is really bad but every
part of it guarantees that the current
Administration will be swept from power
and we're going to have a real good
chance of fixing stuff now that assumes
they don't rig the election and as I've
um estimated before I don't think Trump
can win unless he's got a 10-point lead
going into the
election he needs a solid 10 points at
5% I think they cheat cheat the election
away from cuz her incentive is so so
high if if you have an incentive that
high you know trying to stop Hitler uh
he's taking our freedom our
democracy then yeah of course they would
cheat it would be crazy not to under
those conditions if they believed that
to be true it'd be crazy not to cheat
but they're not going to get away with
it if there's a 10-point difference on
Election Day they just can't cheat that
much so the the whole game is to get
Trump above 10 points
and I really think 10 because it's
double digits you know you got to hit
double digits before you can reasonably
claim there's no way that election was
real if you're within 2
4% anything's possible maybe the maybe
the polling was
flawed maybe but 10 points 10 points get
you at president Trump and right now
you've got the colleges completely
falling apart the college students going
home and you know zooming with their
parents who who were the Democrats that
sent them there that's not going to be
popular
and it seems to me that uh every single
trend is pro Trump at this point there
there's
nothing that isn't Pro Trump is there
can you think of anything that isn't Pro
Trump in terms of the trend that you're
observing I can't think of anything am I
missing anything there must must be
something that's anti-trump
anything the the only trends that are
happening that are anti- Trump are
artificial ones for example there does
seem to be an uptick in January 6
prosecutions like Trump's lawyer Etc now
maybe it's just my impression but it
seems like Democrats are trying to
create some kind of a news Trend out of
their own bad actions of law faring
Trump people because can turn that into
look how look how criminal all these
Trump people are so they can literally
uh illegitimately prosecute them
selective prosecution and then claim
that it's a sign that they should have
been prosecuted because there's so many
of them that were
prosecuted look at how many we
prosecuted that's proof they should have
been
prosecuted that that's where they're
heading on
that yes
indeed all right I feel like there was
at least one thing that I want to tell
you that I forgot let me just check here
uh College protest never Biden got that
got
that yeah I think I got it
all de Dei is racist is my favorite
story all right ladies and
gentlemen um what about operation warp
speed well operation warp speed I think
is
history and the thing that can save
Trump is that he did not
mandate how how many of you think that
Trump is in the clear on vaccinations CU
he didn't mandate
and you had basically the information
that you
needed everybody knew that the
vaccination was rushed everybody knew
that it had not been tested for 5
years what else did you need to
know was that enough
see as long as it wasn't
mandatory and they say we rushed this
thing and you know it'd be great if we
could Testa for 5 years but we
didn't you had a choice now you were not
well informed because you didn't know
the actual risks but you knew it was a
situation which had to be high risk it
had to be you every one of you knew that
so he gave you a choice of two risky
situations and let you pick here's your
risky situation take your chances with
the co and we don't exactly know what's
going on there because it's you know may
have been made to be a weapon so maybe
there's some tricks in there we haven't
seen yet or take your chance with the
vaccination which and some would say is
taking your chance with two things
because it didn't help you with the with
the co
enough so I feel like he can sell that
because he's selling freedom
with
information now if he said what he
couldn't claim is that you knew from the
scientists what the risks were that
would not be the right claim because we
did not know from the scientists what
the risks would be but we knew from the
news we we knew that they rushed and we
knew that they could not possibly have
time to check it for five years because
it had only been
one all of that was known to everybody
it was just the forcing you to take it
that was the problem
that was the problem and he wasn't
behind
that yeah he he wasn't for closing
schools he wasn't for mandatory
vaccinations I think he can make that
work he Trump hasn't tried hard enough
to sell it what he has done is said that
the the vaccination saved
lives and here's the problem with
that how many of you do this I saw
somebody uh somebody smart did this the
other day C
so even cernovich did this um I think
well I don't want to blame him if I'm
thinking of somebody else so let me make
this more generic so it's not about
cerovich uh how many of you would would
agree with the following
statement the vaccinations did not work
against
Co in any way not only did they not stop
transmission that part we all know but
that that they didn't reduce your uh
odds of of hospitalization or death how
many of you would say it's true that
they had no value and in fact had
negative value how many Embrace that
negative value from the first
day now here's the here's the catch from
day
one so many of you would say it had no
value from day one all right now let me
ask you a follow-up
question how many are aware that the the
virus morphed from from something that
was close to what the vaccination would
help with to something that was
irrelevant to the
vaccinations how many of you knew that
Co is not one thing it's maybe several
things and that the claim from the
people disagree and this is not my claim
this is the official claim is that it
worked great against the alpha and maybe
the Delta but that as soon as Omicron
came by it was it was worse than
it was more negative than helpful now in
my observation most people don't make
that distinction and they act like the
it was always Omicron Omicron is just a
cold Omicron is just a cold and they act
as though the only reason that there
were excess deaths are ventilators
that's clearly not the
case that's obviously not the case yes
maybe people died being put on
ventilators didn't need to be but
there's no way that the excess
death
rate was from the ventilators it wasn't
just the
ventilators so here's what I think I
think that uh among the political
right uh there's a refusal to understand
that Omicron was just a cold and Alpha
and Delta might have been bad
definitely not just a cold in my opinion
based on
observation but the uh the left seems to
think that the uh the co started bad and
stayed that way because you see so many
of them still wearing masks when now
it's definitely just the
cold so I think that both sides and this
is just sort of an average thing I know
lots of individuals have figured it out
but the left is in this fantasy world
where it was always the same virus
and the right is in the fantasy world
where it was always
Omicron and then we pretend that we're
having a debate when those are both
ridiculous points of view so I try not
to even debate anybody who has the point
of view that it was always Omicron or
the point of view that it it's always
ins still Alpha and
Delta none of those are based on any
kind of
thinking right so but overall were the
vaccination is more bad than good I
don't know I don't
know and I I'm sure you don't know as
well you you could certainly say that if
you're getting a you know third booster
for Omicron that's clearly a mistake
would you all agree with that if you got
a third booster because of
Omicron that's a medical
mistake in my
opinion in the beginning I'm not so sure
I would say the same thing all right
that's what I got for you today I'm
going to say goodbye to the uh YouTube
and Rumble and X people I'm going to
chat with
locals and they'll stay on here in
theory and the rest of you will see me
