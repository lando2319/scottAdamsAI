[Music]
well let's get some comments up
here we're going to have a good
time what with all the news and
stuff boy it's getting spicy out there
it's getting spicy out there
[Music]
[Music]
people good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams You' never had a better time
but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that no one can
understand with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need is a cuper my girl
glass a tanker Chels or Stein a canteen
Jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it happens now
go well let's see if there's any latest
news about the health benefits of
coffee yes there is turns
out according to these science alert
people that uh there's a study that says
that uh drinking coffee and maybe some
tea we don't want want to leave the tea
drinkers out could be lowering the risks
of dementia but only if they had high
blood pressure so the correlation is if
you have high blood pressure it might um
help you with your lowering your risk of
dementia so um I have high blood
pressure and I drink coffee so in 10
years I'm going to give you some
feedback and I'm going to tell you if
the drinking of the
coffee reduced my chance of dementia so
10 years from now if you don't hear
anything from me that means the dementia
got me and the coffee didn't work but if
I do remember for 10 years and 10 years
later I say whoa looks like it's
September 20th it's uh yeah it's 2034 I
thought I'd get back to you and let you
know that the dementia did not get me so
that's one data
point I have a question for you I you
use or try to use chat GPT in voice mode
on my
phone it seems to be programmed so it's
only going to give me two interactions
before it pretends to have a technical
problem now the first 25 times I did
this I said to myself well this is some
temporary bug that they're going to need
to work out but now I'm fairly certain
that it's intentional does anybody have
this experience where if you're typing
into chat GPT it works fine but if you
ask it three to five questions when you
hit about the third question he goes bad
cell phone connection we don't know
what's wrong we cannot answer and it
won't work for you again until you come
back hours later but when you come back
hours later the first two questions
perfect and then we'll pretend to have a
technical problem so do you have this oh
okay okay I'm getting yeses all right so
that's intentional right because I don't
see any way that you could talk to it
twice reliably every time but by the
time you get to the third question it's
always broken on the third question oh
we cannot talk I I don't I don't
understand your question and then it
won't work for the rest of the time okay
all right so I'm getting lots of yeses
so it works fine if you use text if
you're just typing in your question it's
just the voice mode that's and that's
intentional right it it's just
pretending that it does work when it
doesn't really ever
work and and and I'll tell you the
trouble it gives
me I'll ask you like health related
questions and it'll get to the most
important part and then it will glitch
out every time so I'll just make this
one up but I'll be like uh chat GPT is
there any correlation between uh people
who are baldish and wear glasses and do
podcasting uh do they they ever have uh
any medical problems well yes there are
reports of serious medical problems for
people who are bald with glasses who do
podcasts and I say really how bad is it
what kind of medical problems well it's
this and that and then I'll ask the
third question I'll be like was that
based on observational studies or you
know gold standard studies because
that's what you really need know is it
like a good study or just some
observational thing and then you're like
you're really like am I going to die am
I going to die Chad GPT tell me am I
gonna die and then Chad GP will be
like go and you're like damn it chat gbt
and you'll ask again and it will be like
oh go go having troubles
now and then I go off thinking I'm going
to die I swear to God that's happened
probably five times where I've gotten to
a lifechanging critical part of my
investigation of whatever I'm asking it
questions about and then it
just dies on
me anyway I assume that it's
intentionally programmed to act like it
works when it
doesn't um we've got a situation of a
man fighting a robot I'm trying to
figure out if this is the first time
have you ever seen a situation where a
man fought a robot and I don't mean for
a
sport I mean it was a fight with a robot
so it's a police robot that was sent
because there was a perpetrator that had
a gun you know locked in a hotel room I
think and the so the robot is like you
know knocking his window out with its
big robot arm and it's it's trying to
teargas him and then the man throws a
blanket over it so it tries to you know
thwart it and then and then actually got
in a fight with a robot and the robot
pinned him down until the police
came so I believe he's the first human
being to have a legitimate fight with a
robot not not a joke not an
entertainment an actual fight for your
life with a
robot and the robot
won so so far if you're keeping score is
robots one Humanity zero
uh so I'm I'm looking forward to a
rematch because I can't really imagine
getting pinned down by a robot on Wheels
I
mean how good is this
robot now I believe the robot was being
uh operated by a human so it was not an
autonomous robot making its own
decisions but still a human lost the
fight to a robot so that's a real
thing I wonder if robots are doing any
other fighting anywhere well look at
this story from the express Ukraine has
a gun wielding robot so they put a
machine gun on a robot that's basically
just four wheels and a and a mechanical
thing looks it's about half the size of
a car and they just send it into Russian
positions and have it machine gun
everybody because when they shoot at it
it you know bolts bounce off and
apparently it took RPG hits and still
kept going so that's pretty serious it's
called the
fury now if they've got one robot that
reportedly you know you can't really
trust any story out of a war zone but
reportedly it just was wiping out the
Russians because because it could go
right to the front line and you know
where they are it's not like everybody
doesn't know where the other side is you
know where they are so you just send
this robot in it just starts shooting
everything
and yeah it took it says it took RPG
hits it says it took more than one and
kept going I don't know how that's
possible that doesn't sound real does
it I'm going to say I don't believe the
r the RPG part I'm going to say no on
that that sounds like but maybe
they have a robot that shoots machine
gun that'd be pretty
amazing in the most unexpected news
which is also the news that tells you
everything you need to know about the
future you want to hear a story that
tells you everything about about the
future here it is Microsoft is trying to
get Three Mile Island nuclear power
plant
reopened because they need so much power
to run their data centers especially
with the AI needs that they're willing
to reopen the undamaged parts of Three
Mile Island because some of it was
undamaged now here's the
thing can you even imagine any other
time in our recent history where any
company could have even said the words
out loud we're thinking of reopening
Three Mile
Island and that people would say you
know that makes sense yeah now that you
mention it that makes perfect
sense
so do you ever wonder if the let's say
the opinions about things like climate
and the opinions about nuclear power do
you think those are
organic do you think that human beings
just do their own research and come up
with some opinions about things like
nuclear
power not too
much because correct me if I'm wrong
nuclear power just went from the worst
thing you could ever have in the world
it's going to kill us all to Let's
reopen Three Mile Island I don't see a
problem with that and it's
Microsoft apparently the big companies
can make you think anything you want
whenever they want
want yeah no problem open up Three Mile
Island I don't see how that could be a
problem and by the way I don't think it
will be a problem I do think it's a good
idea just to be clear it's just that how
quickly the comp the country went from
oh nuclear will kill us all too oh we
better do a lot of nuclear to save us
all and I would like to
note that uh for the past 20 years I've
been saying you better do some nuclear
you're going to really really really
regret it if you don't you better get
going on that you better hurry up and
here we are if you wait long enough
eventually everybody agrees with me you
just have to
wait anyway let's see what else is going
on uh uh this is one of my favorite
stories I knew about this but now this
researcher got an award so there's a
researcher who got the IG Noble Prize he
debunked the uh the blue zones now blue
zones are places around the world where
allegedly there were pockets of people
who were living well beyond a 100 and
you know the researchers wanted to see
why they live so long so they would
study them they say oh you eat a lot of
fish do you and you live to over a
hundred fish is good and then they would
look at all the things they did and say
just just do what they do don't use a
cell phone they're living
forever well this researcher saw Justin
Newman decided to go around and see what
was up with these so-called blue zones
found out they're all
fake there there's no such thing as
places where people routinely live to
over a 100 because they have such good
lifestyle choices nope never existed
what they do have is places where people
routinely lie about how old they are
because being old is uh valued In some
cultures so there are people who don't
have birth certificates and nobody can
prove otherwise H they just add 10 to 20
years to their to their actual age when
they reach
80 so all it was was
Liars but we thought we had discovered
like the secret to Eternal uh life well
you just eat enough cucumbers and look
what you can do no it turns out it's
lying it's lying there's your science
for you
uh well the here's a here's the nerdiest
thing you're going to hear today over 90
this is from Hy
daily for horiculture Hy daily uh over
90% of seed sector uh insiders so these
are people who work with
seeds uh they say they expect
Innovations will breed more resilient
and productive varieties of crops within
two decades well I suppose that's just
more of what's already been happening
but here's like the one of the least
important sounding fields of science
that might be the most important so
we're all sitting around saying how
could we lower our food
prices well one way which isn't going to
be immediate is if you had better seeds
so if you had better seeds you grow
twice as much food in the same amount of
space with the same amount of everything
you get twice as much so that should
look your cost so seeds are a big deal
and it made me wonder I wonder how hard
it would be to be a seed
experimenter because I don't think
they're putting chemicals on the seeds
right aren't they just mixing one kind
of plant with another plant and doing
selective breeding of some kind because
I thought isn't that the sort of thing
you could do at home on your own you
know with like one tabletop because all
you're doing is planting a bunch of
seeds and seeing what works
I don't know seems like it'd be a good
job I'm a seed guy I I just do 20 seeds
at a
time well I made a uh post yesterday
that's more about a feeling you know the
Zeitgeist have you ever heard that word
German word for how everybody's feeling
at the same time for reasons that you
can't quite identify because there's not
it's not like there's a specific news in
the story it's not like there's a
specific story in the news
it's more like just people are feeling a
certain way suddenly and you're not
exactly sure what caused it but you can
certainly identify it and here's what I
feel I feel like men have
decided who's going to win the
presidency now there could be
Shenanigans so but I'm only talking
about the vote or the attempted
vote and I think it's
over I think the decision has already
been made and I think that Trump will
will win on votes we don't know if he'll
become president because there's too
many Shenanigans uh and I isn't it
couldn't be more than a coin flip even
if you win the vote it couldn't be more
than a coin flip so here's
why here's what I
sense let me explain something about men
and evolution and
biology and I'd love to see if you agree
with this so these are I going to make
some general statements about men now
before you say to me but Scott this is
also true of women yes it is but Scott
why are you leaving the women out I'm
not Scott why are you saying this is
only about men I'm not now even though
I've said that the very first comment is
going to be what about the women what
about the women no you're included it's
just that this is more more weighted
toward men right but women definitely
included and here's my
statement when there is a vacuum of
leadership what do men
do do you know what we do when there's a
vacuum of
leadership well if there is a leader
what we love to do is just go about our
business because we have a leader if you
give me a leader I just ignore
leadership
I go oh we got one leader is doing okay
all right good you go lead I'll go do my
thing make my thing work what happens if
you can sense that there's no
leadership unfortunately the way we
Menor wired and this is my statement you
can I'd love to see if you believe this
or feel it or or recognize it as true
that when men see a vacuum of leadership
they
act and we don't even have a choice
it's not even a choice now again it's
not every man does this and it's not
that every woman doesn't right so we're
we're allowing that all people are
individuals so there could be all kinds
of that but in
general men cannot Abide a vacuum in
leadership we just can't handle it and I
think it's biological I think we just
evolved so that we will have a leader so
if your pack of wolves doesn't have a
leader one of the Wolves is going to say
 I guess I guess I'm going to have
to try out to be leader because you're
not going to go leaderless you won't go
leaderless you're going to do it now we
we men and plenty of women
too feel the vacuum of
leadership we don't know exactly what's
going on but we can feel that Biden's
not running things and we can feel that
kamla not because she's a woman this
doesn't have anything to do with the
gender but her capability and how she
got there suggests she's not really the
leader even if she gets the job so we
feel more leader less than we've ever
felt before now that doesn't mean that
that every man has to run for president
because we do have a solution it's
called
Trump and I believe that there's this
unspoken but men can feel it that we've
already
decided we've decided we're going to
have a
leader it's going to be
Trump and we're just going to make it
happen and it almost doesn't matter who
gets in the way at this point because
it's not a
preference it's a decision and I swear
to God I could feel the decision being
made this week I don't know what it was
you know obviously this just a
subjective you know mental thing that's
happening with me but I'm just wondering
if anybody else feels it
do you feel it that men have just
decided and that we're not going to do
this anymore we're not going to leave
the Border open we're not going to leave
the the women unprotected in the cities
we're just going to handle it but we
don't need to talk about it well I mean
I do because I do this for a living but
men in general don't need to talk about
it and I'd like to ask you to do the
following if there are young men in your
life and pretty much everybody at least
knows somebody who's young and
male ask them if they feel it
too and then help them get registered
because they might not know what the
process looks like help them get
registered to vote now here's what you
don't need to do you don't need to tell
them who to vote for do you know
why they can feel
it the males can feel it they can feel
the difference in leadership and they
don't need to know the
policies they need to know that Trump is
willing to be a leader and capable he's
willing and he's capable and by the way
it doesn't really have anything to do
with him being
male if it had been you know let's just
pick a name Tulsi gabard and she had you
know reached this point and we knew she
could be a leader then she would have
she would have all the support of the
men as well but we need leadership and
we can feel it in Trump
even if he don't like everything he
wants to do um and I think it's
decided and I think that here here's the
part that's going to be weird for
you if you talk to the young men in your
life I want you to tell them
this tell them that I and you can you
know they won't know who I am so you
have to describe who I am tell them that
I told them it's
time just tell them told them it's time
and that is time to register and you
don't need to tell them who to vote
for they'll handle it just tell them
it's time because every man is waiting
for their moment even young men
sometimes there's a war and the young
men sign up because that's their
moment sometimes they might need to
protest civil rights for example but
they'll feel it they'll know when it's
their time this is this is Young Men's
time if young men register in the next
month and decide that they would like
actual leadership in the country for the
first time in a while they can do it
it's your time tell them that I said
it's their time now the thing you should
be saying to me is why would I tell them
that because they don't even know who
you are which is
true here's why
men need to be told what to
do and on one hand we have a very
specific impulse to know what to do we
know that there's a leadership vacuum
and we know we have to fill it but we
also need to be a little more specific
than that can you maybe can we get on
the same page about what we're doing
okay it's a war I got it okay it's a war
I know what to do I sign up for the War
I go to war but tell us what to do so
I'm telling them what to do will they
will they listen to me weirdly yes
weirdly yes even without knowing who I
am you know why because I'm male and I'm
telling them what to
do and Men respond to that we like to be
told what to do if it makes sense if it
doesn't make sense we don't like it at
all but if it makes sense we like
order we we like chaos to be solved we
like to know what works we know we like
to know what's happening now and what
will happen next we want to know that
there's cause and effect we want to know
that we can fix
things the young men feel all of that
they just need to know one more thing
it's their time civilization literally
depends on young men waking up in the
next 30 days or could I mean there's you
lots of variables but if you fix that
one variable young men just tell them
it's time time the the waiting's over
it's time you need to get registered you
know and it's probably going to be vot
by mail wherever you are so it's not
like you have to go anywhere you don't
have to miss a day of work you don't
have to leave your uh video games you
just got to go to a website sign up to
vote and a thing comes in the mail in
the next few weeks so tell them I son
tell them I said it's time because it's
time
meanwhile we've entered uh I think the
October surprises are coming
early um so there's a report there's
going to be a whole bunch of stories in
the next month or so that are the most
bullshitty of the
 so the following stories I'm
going to tell you I don't believe any of
them so these are just claims that
popped up in the last 24 hours so Tim
wal has his former National Guard
colleague who says that some nuclear
manuals went missing around the time
that Waltz returned from a trip to
China and he believes that wals stole
some nuclear
manuals now the first question I'd ask
is what the hell kind of nuclear manuals
would somebody in the National Guard
have access
to I'd like to give my opinion which is
nothing if there's anything that that he
knew knew in his job which had nothing
to do with anything in the nuclear field
it would have to be something basic like
if a nuclear war breaks out be sure to
do this or that it's not like it's
secrets on how to build a bomb I I'm
pretty sure that Tim wals did not have
access to the secret Manual of how we're
going to attack other countries with our
nukes or how to build one so the first
thing you have to ask yourself is what
is this classified new nuclear
manual probably something if you and I
read it we say oh that doesn't look too
important it's just something official
government thing so um while it would be
wonderfully useful to to Republicans If
This Were true and he was some kind of a
Chinese spy stealing nuclear secrets for
China I'm going to say no on this
one I'm going to say this is a little
too little too on the knows sounds like
just something that comes up a month
before a vote none of this seems real to
me all right now I'm going to be fair so
I'm GNA say Democrats got some fake news
Republicans got some fake news so
there's more to
come there's a who is Mark Robinson is
he
a is he a Governor Mark
Robinson uh black political leader who
is GOP or is he in the house anyway
there's a political uh Republican who's
accused of having been in some kind of
porn related conversations online prior
to running for
office and allegedly he called himself a
black
Nazi now am I worried about any of that
not
really do do we think it happened I
don't know does it matter nope
nope here here's my take suppose it's
all true there's no claim he did
anything illegal there's no claim he did
anything um immoral you know given that
the context that allegedly happened was
people who would talk like that so he
wouldn't be offending anybody
necessarily and certainly if you call
yourself if you are black and you call
yourself a black Nazi nobody's going to
take that
seriously I mean nobody's going to take
that seriously that just sounds like
something you'd say online so I'm going
to say doesn't matter if he said these
things or not if it was before he was in
office it was in the context of people
playing around down online and saying
things
anonymously I don't care does anybody
care if all of it had been true because
none of it's
illegal it's just playing a character
online to you know get a thrill I don't
care you fine run for president I'm fine
with that no problem at all how about
uh let's see there's a story that RFK Jr
had some kind of a two personal
relationship with a reporter who had
been working for the New York Magazine
so Olivia
nuzzi uh allegedly was having some
messaging or something they got too
personal with RFK uh RFK Jr some people
are suggesting that they um had an
affair but the evidence does not suggest
any kind of physical contact so they
both deny any physical contact and
apparently they met once during the
context of an interview I doubt that led
to sex immediately following the
interview so I'm going to say this
doesn't sound real to me it may be that
they became friends and chatted a little
bit on text and I'm not saying they did
I'm just saying what
because other people are characterizing
it without showing us
anything if you're not going to show us
the
conversation don't you dare characterize
it for
me a month before an
election can can we agree on that if
you're not going to show me a screenshot
and by the way I don't want to see any I
don't want to see any but if you're
going to refer to somebody else's
conversation and not show it to me and
tell me that it's inappropriate
sorry nope nope I'm not I'm not going to
take Tim wals and his magical stealing
of nuclear documents doesn't sound real
to me and no I'm not going to say that
somebody he met once for one interview
wasn't aair nope doesn't sound real to
me did they did they become
friends in in some kind of text
messaging way I don't care he's allowed
to have friends he can text people he
can text anybody
wants so let's not make something out of
nothing and then there's there's some
dirt dug up on Christopher rufo that
looks so unlikely to be true that I'm
not going to even repeat what the rumor
is let so here here's the larger point
it does seem to me that there's probably
a list of prot trump supporters and
people leaning in that direction who are
being targeted and that the the
targeting is sort of concentrated in the
month before the
election
now does it look like there's been a lot
of targeting would you
agree it's not an accident that just
everybody's getting a scandal and I keep
waiting for mine like every time there's
one of these new Scandal things like the
this the Scandal about Tim Po and the
others who who may have been connected
without knowing it to some money source
that was
Russian I'm just waiting for me to be
thrown on some list you know with no
time to debunk it before the election
and I think the idea is just to you know
just screw everybody who would possibly
disagree with the the Deep State at this
point um
but so I you should put a deep level of
skepticism on every Claim about anybody
in the public for the next 6 weeks
I mean you should always be skeptical
remember Gil Man
Amnesia where the only things you know
are fake news are the ones you know
about
personally all right I see that um so
did he is in jail pending trials I guess
and uh some say he was reportedly placed
on suicide watch as he awaits trial
now that could be to get him out of the
general population so he may have just
acted like he was going to commit
suicide so they didn't have to be around
regular prisoners who might be paid to
kill them to keep them quiet you know
sort of Epstein style so it could be a
strategy but I would also think that
given the things he's been charged with
that he actually would be thinking of
suicide I don't know how you do it
easily in jail but um is isn't this also
the same thing that the Deep state does
before they murder somebody in jail
isn't the first thing you do is say
well uh he is talking about killing
himself so that later when we find him
strangled to Death In His in his uh cell
they're going to say well I mean we've
been priming you for months that this is
the sort of guy who's threatening to
kill himself and sure enough he
strangled himself in his cell and that's
not easy but he was very motivated so he
strangled himself to
death I feel like that's just obviously
coming and by the way we are so primed
and beaten down by the illegitimacy of
our government and the news and whoever
is really running things that they could
actually just kill
him and say yep he beat himself to death
with a stick and 100% of the people
would say that's not real and then the
news would say oh it's real and then
we'd say it's not real and that we do
that for a few months and then we get
tired and then we just move on to the
next outrage they can kill him right in
front of
you
and honestly I'd be surprised if they
don't at this point given given that
there's no way they get
caught we know it works and it's
probably life and death for a lot of
people who would be willing to pull the
trigger sort of you know paying somebody
to do it in jail so I feel we're at that
point where it's like Putin murdering
his dissidents like Putin can apparently
if you believe the
news Putin can just poison the dissonant
and we'll get really mad for a few
months and then we'll just move on and
then he can poison another one and then
we'll get really mad and then we'll move
on so I think they could do the same
thing to Diddy we'll get mad and then
we'll move on and nobody will go to jail
for
it but there are some bad qu incidences
happening apparently a bunch of record
or music industry people retired the day
after Diddy got arrested people are
saying well that's a weird coincidence
all these powerful people who probably
went to a diddy party are retiring just
at the exact time that some pressure
might be coming on them then we hear
that the CEO of Nike is going to step
down and the CEO of some other company
is going to step down so people are
trying to connect these dots like wait a
minute wait a minute have you ever been
to a diddy party
and the answer is probably
no probably no but if you'd been
planning for a long time to retire at
around this time because it's a good
time to retire this is like the ultimate
time to retire because then you get
Christmas off everybody knows that
right if you're going to retire you want
to do it in April so you get the summer
off or you do it in sort of October is
you know September is so you get
Christmas off sort of basic strategy for
retiring so these could be
coincidences there's a funny story in
China that there's a zoo that didn't
have any pandas so they took these fuzzy
dogs and they painted them to look like
pandas and apparently it fooled people
until the pandas started barking and
panting okay and they were actually
selling these as panda dogs like a
version of pandas yeah they look like
dogs but they're pandas but it looks
exactly like a dog you painted yeah yeah
that's how they look that's a panda dog
really cuz it looks like just a dog that
you painted I know that's what the panda
dogs look like they look like painted
dogs they're called panda dogs but
they're not
real meanwhile a chin warlord claims
that Elon Musk gave him a cyber truck he
put a machine gun on it and took it into
battle uh but that that mean old uh mean
old Elon Musk remotely disabled his
machine gun Tesla truck and he' to be
towed off the battlefield he's really
mad about it now does that sound like a
real story to you do you do you think
that Elon Musk gave a chatan
warlord uh his own Tesla truck and then
turned it off so he couldn't use it in
battle well what do you think Elan mus
said here this was was his response to
that
story he said in a quote Are you
seriously so that you think I
donated a cyber truck to a Russian
general I have no further
[Laughter]
questions I have no further
questions now remember I keep telling
you that the way that the way Trump
should respond to some of his hoaxes is
with this exact form this exact
form this is Elon Musk answering a hoax
with the exact exact right method there
this is so perfect that you could take a
class on this right here's what's
perfect about it you do not say I did
not do
that because people don't believe that
because people want to believe what they
want to believe you do not say it's a
hoax and try just leave it there because
people say well that's what you say when
it's true here's what you don't
say if you're trying to hide it quote
Are you seriously so that you
think I donated a cyber truck to a
Russian
general
perfect perfect what have I what have
been what have I been telling you that
uh Trump should say do you really think
that as an acting president I stood in
front of the United States and told them
and said that neo-nazis were good people
do you think that actually happened in
the real world of course it didn't now
you don't want Trump to say are you so
 that you think that but adding
adding the word we're not supposed to
say which by the way I don't like that
word in public but I'm quoting so I I
prefer not using it although I love the
word it it's just for some reason it's
the perfect word for a lot of things uh
but I you know I understand I understand
the sensitivity to it so I prefer not
using
it but in uh in musk's case because it
it uh is
so is so
perfectly
capsules the situation that I approve of
it in this
context I I think I think it was exactly
right all
right open AI allegedly I don't know if
this is even true so some users are
saying they're getting emails from open
AI that would be the chat GPT people um
saying that they got to stop using
little tricks to figure out how it
thinks B basically it's Chain of Thought
So if you can figure out its Chain of
Thought I guess that would either give
you some way to thwart it or copy it or
or something so apparently chat GPT is
monitoring the questions you're asking
and if you ask questions it would get
you to somehow understand how it
reasons that they can block you from
ever using it again now I'm not sure
this story is
true it's not quite passing my sniff
test but it could be it could be but I
don't believe it so I'm going to I'm
going to go no on that one um but only
uh 5545 on that one I'm going to go 55%
not true meaning that there's something
left out you know just some context left
out um and
45% maybe it's just what it looks like
maybe don't know for
sure well another hoax of the day Tim
wals keeps saying that uh uh Trump wants
to create a federal abortion monitor
and apparently he's been fact checked by
breit B at USA Today sopes doesn't make
any difference still says it
because his base doesn't care sounds
good enough so I think uh and I might
have to
slightly
slightly um give him a little bit of
cover I'm no Tim Wall's fan just to be
clear but if this were Trump who said
that I might have been
tempted might have been to say it's a
little bit directionally
correct now it's not correct it's very
much specifically false but is he
telling his people hey if you get a
bunch of Republicans in office things
could change quickly in terms of
abortion laws and the answer is yes yes
if you put Republicans in charge let's
say they owned everything um could
things change quickly in the abortion
World in ways that the left doesn't like
the answer is yes yes it could now Trump
is not promising to do anything beyond
the things he says he was going to do I
personally think that he's going to
stick to that because it's consistent
with his own beliefs about abortion
forever not forever but for a while and
and so that's believable because it's
just consistent with all the other
things he said but I could see why
they'd be worried and as a persuasion
trick it works so in very much the way I
don't think a lot of Haitians are eating
pets but it's directionally accurate in
terms of making you feel there's a
threat to Bringing In Too Many people
too quickly blah blah
blah so it's not true but I can see why
he's using it politically makes
sense
um so Jordan Peterson points out on a
post on X never trust anyone who wields
the term disinformation as a
weapon and what pit of Hell did that
bited term emerge from anyway what
propagandistic propagandistic genius
coined how did it spread so
virally no one said disinformation 10
years ago well that's true
and along those lines I've pointed out
there are some other words that you only
hear when people are trying to basically
manipulate you without facts the other
ones I mentioned before are unhinged
chaos and ending democracy because
they're just so vague but you have to
make it sound like it's
bad thank you first
gear
um so yes I would agree whenever you
hear these words disinformation unhinged
chaos and ending democracy and there are
a few extra ones there I would say those
are signals that somebody's using
propaganda and if you are echoing any of
these words if you've heard that
propaganda and then you go out and call
Trump unhinged or his supporters or any
of that you're just
brainwashed these are not words that
give any meaning mean to anything these
are just
words but Trump also uses some words
that the left calls out as uh being
let's say symbols of evil so he talks
about other countries being infested
countries I think infested with bad
behavior or something and he says some
of the people coming in the criminals
specifically or Vermin but of course the
left tries to generalize those terms and
to he's talking about all the people
from this country therefore he's racist
now he's obviously not talking about the
general citizens of any country he's
talking about the worst members of those
countries being selectively the ones
more likely to come here because they
can get out of jail and stuff I don't
know what any if there's any truth to
the jail
part but is it directionally correct
yeah it is again it's directionally
correct that un unchecked Asylum laws
and immigration are a real danger to the
country but I would prefer that Trump
did not use words like Vermin and
infested because it does Echo back to
some hitlerian language and there's no
no benefit to it so if if Trump gets no
benefit from it and it activates people
making them think something that isn't
true it's not the best word to use and I
don't think it gets many
extra votes on the Republican side
there's no there's no Republican who
said you know until he called them
Vermin I wasn't convinced it's not
persuasive if it had been persuasive
like they're eating the pets that's
persuasive not
true but at least you could argue that
it's directionally useful this has no
use there's there's no utility to using
words like verman and infested when you
could use words that tell the same story
and would get you the same amount of
votes so that's my advice don't use
those
anymore well I think I saw five
different stories of election
irregularities before the actual
election so uh I'll just mentioned two
but I think I said five of them this
morning where there were various either
counties or states that had some kind of
big issue with voter roles or chain of
custody or
change they needed to do to improve it
they got not approved it's all these
different things but I'll just read two
so in Oklahoma they removed
450,000 ineligible names from the voter
roles let me say that
again this week this week the elections
like right around the corner they
removed four
450,000 people from the list of people
who would have been allowed to vote if
they hadn't removed them
450,000 in
Oklahoma that's like a lot of the entire
population of Oklahoma do you think this
could have changed the
result yes yes it could have totally
changed the result if if there was also
on top of this some bad behavior to use
those names as fake votes now that part
we don't know but we know there was an
enormous opportunity for bad behavior a
100,000 of them were dead people 15,000
of them were
duplicates and a lot of them were just
the wrong address they don't live at the
address that that they uh are registered
at so now that's just one state
so why did they have to get rid of
450,000 names why did they have to get
it off the voter rules here's what
confuses
me if this is a gigantic
problem why was our election so
definitely
fair when we know this existed in the
last election this didn't just just
happen this is some kind of long ongoing
problem so how do we know the election
was
fair what would be the mechanism by
which we could know that if we know that
this kind of problem
existed but luckily luckily it's only
Oklahoma right oh thank goodness it's
only Oklahoma no it's not they all have
some kind of problem here's another
one uh election officials in luzar
County that's in Pennsylvania one of you
know the most important state we think
for the election um have banned all
mailin ballot dropboxes from the county
over fears of voter
fraud now you know what I'm going to ask
right why would they need to ban mailin
ballot
dropboxes because we were told that when
they were
used that was a deeply secure election
why would you need to change it if it
was
secure nothing they told us about the
ction is real it's all fake almost
everything we've been told is fake and
there's almost nothing that makes me
more Angry than when I see somebody on
the regular news uh say with confidence
and that that fake stupid looking um
confidence that the election was fair
and that we all know it the election was
fair and we all know it
how how could you know that is the most
unknowable thing in the country in fact
I don't think there's anything less
knowable than who won the election you
couldn't know anything less you know
unless it was a landslide I
suppose how about
this um Tennessee they have a new law
requiring to use voter verifiable paper
audit trails to improve election
Integrity wait why does that make sense
why would you need to change something
in Tennessee
to have an audit Trail when we were told
that you can tell if the election was
fair without any change at all because
it was already perfect and we know it
was all fair why would you need to
implement a new way to know it was fair
if you already know it's fair huh huh
it's like they've been lying to
us about every thing they've
said about the election four
years and do they even know it do the
people in the news know
know that every state is making
apparently big changes to the election
because they had giant holes and V
abilities and at the same time they say
but the elections have all been fine
they've been fine they've been fine yeah
there are 100 holes and we're trying to
fix them and we can't fix them but
before fine yeah we know
it
um how about uh the RNC says
Pennsylvania County there was a
Pennsylvania County daily wire is
reporting this
um they say that there's a county that
ignored state law before sending out
mailin
ballots um they uh the ballots without
conducting accurate C
tests so why do you need to stop these
ballots going out and why do you need to
do accuracy tests when the system is so
secure
it's not me
right can can you tell me this isn't me
they are telling us the system is great
and it's got a thousand holes in it and
they're reporting them same at the same
time I'm not imagining that am
I but I'll tell you if you were a
Democrat how many of these stories would
you have seen so I just read you what
five and I saw several more just today
this is today this is not this week or
thisth
today just today these are the headline
stories how many how many Democrats saw
these
stories none it's like it doesn't
exist anyway there's a story about a New
York City covid adviser during the
pandemic so he was advising people on
what to do about covid you know with the
make sure you're six feet apart and wear
your mask and all that stuff and
apparently he was going to secret drug
fueled sex parties and he had to be
sneaky now on one hand I say to myself
well that's a terrible hypocrite leader
doctor guy when he was telling people to
be careful but then he was going off and
not being careful
himself to which I say I'll bet that was
Universal or close to it my guess well
let me put a percentage on it my guess
is that something like 20 or 25% of the
public was genuine genely scared and
genuinely wore masks and genuinely
stayed away from people and all that but
that
80% or 75 were more
like my
house where um if I went out in public
sometimes I'd wear a mask if I didn't
want to cause trouble but as soon as I
came home I'd take them off and I
required no masks in my house and you
know at kids kids you know friends of
kids and stuff running through all the
time so so it was basically like you
know reams of people completely ignoring
all all of that privately I just
publicly I pretended to go along you
know until I couldn't do that anymore
and then then I had to become a a mask
Rebel for a while so I think I think
that was closer to Universal I don't
even I really don't even care that this
guy was telling us to do one thing and
doing something else because I think
everybody was doing the same
thing um so kamla was on Oprah you'd
think this would be the friendliest
interview in the world and it was but uh
here are some things that came out of it
number one it's very clear that K kamla
Harris is an idiot um because all it did
is produce Clips the Republicans showed
without comment
if you do an
interview and your opponents can show
clips from it multiple clips it's not
even one thing and you don't need to add
a comment you just
say h look at this which is basically
what social media was doing it's like H
look at this and it shows her just how
well the passage of time and uh I grew
up in a small town and uh I own a gun
and it just looked like an
idiot and in my opinion she looked
inebriated does anybody else think she
looked inebriated on
Oprah I would say Obviously again I'm
going to say why are you pretending you
don't see
it is that what's happening are you
pretending you don't see it now most of
you do see it but I'm talking about the
rest of the world it is the entire
Democratic Party pretending they don't
see this because I think they are I
think they're actually pretending now
there's a reason that the uh let's say
the legitimate corporate news is not
talking about this at
all it's because they can't prove it and
if you can't prove it it would be a hell
of a thing to say if you're a legitimate
news organization but you and I are just
citizens right I mean I do this on a
podcast but um I'm a citizen you know
nobody nobody gives me a paycheck from a
corporate entity and when I look at her
it's to me it's obvious she's
inebriated now you could argue about
what the source of the inebriation is
but we've seen her clearly not
inebriated if we' seen her always acting
like this every time she went in public
I'd say well maybe she just has sort of
a you know goofy cackling personality
and that's just who she is but we've
seen her not inebriated quite a few
times in the in the uh the debate for
example definitely not inebriated
definitely not but on Oprah you tell me
that's not
inebriated I want you to say you know
I'd love somebody to say that to my face
I just want to look in your eyes and say
really really that that looks that looks
totally fine to you
right to me this so um this so matches
how they treated uh Biden like they
didn't see a problem I don't see a
problem what are you talking about well
no you see he's obviously got demena and
he displays it on a regular basis
really I'm not seeing it I don't know
what are you talking
about so we're just doing it
again the funniest part was looking at
uh oa's face now I can't read her
mind but other people had the same
comment you know without me bringing it
up first so when I watched that I looked
at Oprah and I thought is Oprah looking
at her like oh my god what have I
done it it looked like
Oprah who other others said has you know
a 20 or 30 point IQ advantage on on
kamla say what you will about Oprah
she's really
smart and I I saw her sitting there
looking at her like oh my God
are is this really
happening that's that's the face I saw
now remember I'm biased so I'm probably
you know mind reading isn't real we
don't know what she was really thinking
but that's how I received it like it
felt like it felt like Oprah knew
exactly what was happening and it was
just what you and I think which is uh
she looks drunk and she's full of word
salad and she's not very smart
so you
decide well there's this interesting
question of whether California made AI
parodies
illegal um like most laws it's written
so you can't tell exactly what it means
but I'm drilling down into this because
I've uh I I've put a stake in the ground
that is opposite to what the news is
telling you so at least the social media
news the social media is saying that a
maker of an AI um parody video of KL
Harris is going to uh Sue California for
their new law that says you can't do AI
parodies now I say well they don't mean
that they mean you can't do AI that
looks like a real
thing and then people who are also smart
and know more than I do say no Scott
they really actually made it illegal to
do a parody
and then I say no that couldn't have
happened that's impossible because you
know there'd be no point in doing it it
would be thrown out as
unconstitutional and then somebody
showed me the phrase in it that says
that parody is not included here's what
I think is happening so this will be my
working
hypothesis I think the reason that we
can't tell if California banned parody
is this very little gray area that's
very tiny and and that would be an
AI um election
related piece that you legitimately
couldn't tell was
fake that's definitely
illegal so if you make a parody that
would look to somebody like a real thing
and you don't label it parody and it's
about something important like an
election that appears to be what is now
illegal I don't have a big problem with
that uh I generally like it when uh the
government says you can't lie to the
public about important things so for
example there's truth in
labeling I like that I like that there's
a law that says you can't just lie on
your label what you have in there um I
like that banks have to calculate their
interest rates in the same way um it's
called the API so because there are
multiple ways you could calculate things
to to game it so it looks like your
interest rate is better or worse than
your compet ition so I like the fact
that the government says no you have to
tell them what your actual comparable
interest rate is good I also like it if
somebody made thing something that
really looked real and it really could
change my vote no I want that labeled I
definitely want that labeled that's not
free speech I mean and it's not free
speech the way I understand it it would
be damaging and created for damage so
that's different
but the the uh specific AI in question
was so obviously a parody in my opinion
that it could not have been
illegal and that parody that's obvious
even if it's about an election that's
not going to be anything you're going
get arrested
for so there maybe some ambiguity in it
and I'm not a lawyer so don't take my
legal interpretations but I can't
believe I live in a world in which an
obvious parody would be
illegal I think it's only the ones that
are not obviously a
parody so and I don't have a problem
with that I think they should be labeled
I don't think you should go to jail if
you don't label it you know maybe you
should get a uh you know maybe blocked
from social media or you suspended for a
week or something but not
jail I don't think Jail's an option
actually
um all right here's
the here's the most fun provocative
thought I'd like to give you today how
many of you are familiar now with the
work of Mike Ben you'll see him mostly
on X and he talks about how there's a
this huge like um let's say web or mesh
of uh disinformation people around the
world and how that all coordinated and
there's a military industrial complex
and the state department is trying to
control every country through
controlling their elections and every
other thing but mostly the uh people in
charge in the United States want to
control everybody's
information but the the biggest theme of
the people who are really in charge
behind the curtain the military
industrial complex the state department
Etc seems to be an
anti-russia thing now not everything
they do but so many things are connected
to this larger multi- deade plot to
weaken Russia so that Russia doesn't
have hydrocarbon meaning gas and oil um
leverage over Europe because if they got
that much leverage they could just turn
off the gas if Europe doesn't give
Russia everything they want and
basically they could conquer Europe
without firing a
bullet so does the state department want
that no it wants Americans to sell you
know liquefied gas instead even though
it's more expensive just so Russia
doesn't have control of the Europe but
is it so much about control or is it
even more about getting Americans to
have access to Russian resources in a
colonial way
basically or colonizing way I should say
and
and suppose you say that's true how how
many of you would accept as a general
proposition that a whole bunch of things
that happen in America that you don't
understand are related to making sure
Russia is
degraded do do you all see that the
anti-russia thing has been from ever
since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of
State it's been anti-putin anti you know
the rumors or anti-russia
Ukraine is about an energy grab more
than it's about anything else so you all
get that for
decades the people who are really
running things the state department CIA
those those people it's been anti-russia
primarily
right now I'm going to blow your
mind why was climate change
invented and I don't mean the invention
of the the fact that the climate
temperature is changing because that's
going to happen no matter what I mean as
a
topic have you noticed that if Europe
started using solar panels and windmills
that that would degrade
Russia is it possible that the reason
you and I don't understand anything
about why we're doing this climate
change business because it doesn't look
like good
economics and it doesn't look like good
science is is that the real reason has
always
been
Russia because we could build um because
we do technology we could build stuff
where we make money on uh solar and
maybe wind but Russia doesn't really
manufacture too well so if if you're not
buying their hydrocarbons they're
basically on a business so could it be
that climate change was never real
and that it was always a deep State plot
to it was just one other angle of attack
against Russia is it entirely an
anti-russia play and none of it's ever
been real meaning that the um the the
models that they use are known not to be
real is that
possible now I'm not stating this as my
belief I'm saying it's
consistent with observation
and what's not consistent with
observation is that everybody thinks the
climate change stuff is a good idea
meaning 98% of the experts I don't
think I yeah and you know is was Al
Gore operating on his
own or was Al Gore part of the you know
deep state state department
anti-russia thing
I don't
know Scott you doubt California
infringed on your rights no did I say
that no ask a better
question here's what I doubt I doubt
that they would infringe on my right in
such an ineffective way that would be
unconstitutional and it would be thrown
out anyway it' be a waste of time but if
they could in if they could uh infringe
on my rights in a way they could get
away with
yeah they' do it all day
long so it's not about whether they
would or would not infringe on my rights
I think they wouldn't do it in a way
that couldn't possibly work and they
would know
that that's what I'm saying you don't do
something that you would know couldn't
possibly
work yeah
anyway here's more Mike BS if you want
to understand how uh the US state
department all works and it's like uh
it's like a few paragraphs and I want to
read it because if you haven't been
exposed to the Mike Ben's you know Ben's
pilling uh for how the real world works
this this will be just an introduction
now he talks more generally about larger
topics this is just about Brazil but
you'll get the sense of it just from
this one story all right so this is from
Mike Ben's onx he says details how the
US state department is actively working
to subvert uh X in Brazil so as you know
Brazil is canceling X and is mad at uh
musk uh he says with he says that the
state department is working with
Brazil against X now that's the opposite
of what the state department should be
doing they should be working to make it
easier for American companies to to
operate overseas not working with a
country that's stopping it why would
they do that well it's because X is the
source of free speech and the people who
control things behind the curtain cannot
have free speech because we've never
really had it this is maybe the first
time and it's dangerous because they
can't control the
narrative so the state department is
allegedly working with the Brazilian
government and installed their current
leader and
uh so here's how Ben says it he says the
state department job is to protect the
welfare of US citizens interest in the
US corporate uh interests and US
national interest in region instead they
just let Brazil seize starlinks assets
so Brazil because it was mad at X seized
assets from an entirely different
company
starlink because musk is the running
both now why in the world would the
United States be okay with
that like that's just mind-blowing that
we'd be okay with that as a as a
country um he says that X is caught in a
proxy war between the state department
and bolsonaro the um the leader who was
deposed
there you can bet if bolsonaro had
banned Twitter one that was when Twitter
was more managed by the people behind
the curtain the whole Litany of our
department of dirty tricks toolkit would
have been crammed down balo's throat so
fast the US want Lula to win that's the
one who did win it's as simple as that
what's happening uh in Brazil has much
less to do with free speech as as do the
state department and the blob's designs
for who needs to win that
election after the state department
overthrows a country or runs tens of
millions of dollars to do a political
opposition and they barely win an
election we have the new policy of
transitional Justice where we arrest all
the opposition leaders bolsonaro right
now is under countless indictments Just
As Trump is
here so if the bad guys in
America overthrow a country whether it's
a us or another country the first thing
they need to do is jail the people who
barely lost so they can't come back and
we're seeing it um then they can prevent
the mobilization and coordination of the
defeated Pary Resurgence of course and
the US is doing with foreign countries
in order to tort the economics of the
USX platform to force them to put the uh
the old censorship mechanisms back in
place so the idea is that the state
department wants X to no longer be a
free speech platform and they can't do
it directly so they work with Brazil
which we've overthrown their government
to get our own person in there allegedly
and working with them which is basically
us because we took over their government
apparently uh or at least were have a
friendly working there and uh that the
two of them the state department and
Brazil would cut X out and maybe they
try the same thing in Europe and then X
becomes no longer financially viable
because too many countries stop using it
at that point free speech is done so
that's what your state department is
doing removing Free Speech according to
this
narrative anyway the uh the thing that
protects the bad people in our
government is that it's all too
complicated and your average citizen
just can't get engaged it's like well
Mike how many different organizations
did you just mention
25 and if you don't understand how all
25 operate you know in a in a semi
coordinated
way you don't know anything you you
would have no understanding of how the
world is working so it's too
complicated all right so there are
reports that Israel killed the deputy
Secretary General of Hezbollah I do not
know how high ranking a deputy secretary
General
is is that below or above the assistant
deputy secretary General is it it's
below a Secretary General but is there
more than something between Deputy I
don't know but somewhere in that higher
up allegedly killed in the air strike in
uh
Beirut and uh apparent there's quite a
battle going on Hezbollah is firing lots
of rockets into Israel as we speak and
Israel is getting pretty fierce in their
attack now Israel having blown up all
those pagers and Walkie talkis are
probably bombing people who can't
coordinate their attack with each other
and I don't know how much difference
that makes you know maybe all they did
is send a run route and say okay
everybody start shooting and maybe
that's all hzb needed
but we shall
see we shall
see all right ladies and
gentlemen
um October is going to have a lot of
surprises um I know of one of
them and I'm not going to tell you I'm
just teasing you but I do know one of
them and you're going to love
[Laughter]
it so there's a surprise coming that's
just going to be so sweet that you're
going to laugh out
loud but when you see a surprise don't
assume that's the one I'm talking
about because there's going to be a
bunch of them and they're going to go
both directions we're seeing it already
they're starting early so there's going
to be I I wouldn't be surprised if
there's a story about me in the news
that's completely made up because I
don't know that there are any real
things I would care about so you should
expect to see more hit pieces on more
people with not enough time to you know
to debunk them um you're going to see
just incredible claims of working with
other countries and Affairs and just all
kinds of stuff so it's going to get
crazy but I will tell you that there's
just one I know
about that you're going to laugh at
you're just going to think it's
funny all right um and it will it will
basically give you everything you want
let's just say that will be the day that
you're going to say to yourself oh oh
looks like things might work out so
there is some cause for
optimism a lot of it actually there's a
lot of cause for optimism and uh that
doesn't mean it's going to happen
automatically still going to have to
fight like
hell which is a phrase that normally
people use that has nothing to do with
physical violence it's just a phrase
that people use when they mean you
should try very hard fight like
hell all right that's all I got for now
I'm gonna uh talk to the locals people
privately because they're so awesome and
the rest of you I will see tomorrow same
time same place thank you X and Rumble
and YouTube see you soon
