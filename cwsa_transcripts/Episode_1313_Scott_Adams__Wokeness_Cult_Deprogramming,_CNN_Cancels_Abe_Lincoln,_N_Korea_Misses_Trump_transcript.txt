hey everybody come on in are you awake
did you set your clocks if you live
someplace where you have to do that
well if you did you're here
and you're ready for the best part of
the day
coffee with scott adams and
to make it special all you need is a cup
of margaret glass so thank you chelsea
stein the canteen yoga flask a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like
and joining coffee now for the
i'm so tired uh
for the dopamine of the day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called simultaneous sip and you're
about to experience it
it'll be special watch go
have you ever had this experience where
you go to bed
and i i have this weird thing where i
hate to sleep
i hate sleeping
and the reason is that when i'm asleep i
feel like
it's like being dead you're just missing
something
you know you i'd rather be awake and you
know enjoy life
um and i've had this problem lately
where i'll wake up and i'll try to guess
what time it is
and i'll think i don't know i feel like
i feel like it's time to get up i could
probably get up
and then i'll i'll check the clock to
see if how i feel
is matching the time on the clock and
the last couple of nights uh i wake up
and i think yeah i think i think i could
get up now it's probably
it's probably early but i think i can
just get up
and it's not even the next day it's
still
it's still the night before like i'll
wake up at 11 30 p.m
and i'll think god i feel like it's it's
time to get up
and this morning i just i just said
screw it i just got up
so we're not working on too much sleep
here the uh
the intercept has a story about uh white
supremacy
and militia groups and it says this
in a tweet the white supremacy and
militia groups were growing under obama
facilitated by social media and in
relation to america having its first
black president
but once trump got in there the ranks
grew much quicker
and there were more organizations do you
see the propaganda
where is the part that says that this
growth in white supremacy is
because of trump because they kind of
suggest
that it's because of trump but what they
said
was technically correct which is that
once he got in there
maybe by coincidence maybe by causation
white supremacy went up if you don't
know that it's causation
i don't feel like you should be hinting
that in a tweet
and isn't it uh if you were to compare
these two hypotheses
one is that uh the number of white
supremacists went up
because of trump and then the other is
that it went up
um for the same reason that trump got
elected
in other words there were forces that
caused
trump to rise at the same time those
forces caused
this other thing to go up and you know
one causes the other versus they're both
caused by the same thing
because it's it's easy to imagine that
let's say
unrestricted immigration would be
bothering people whether
trump became president or not
what would you guess is the uh
the number of white supremacists under
wait for it biden
do you think we'll ever see a tweet that
says the number of white
supremacists went up during biden's
presidency
and would they suggest that there's a
reason for it which is that biden is
president
i don't think so i think it's pretty
clear
that this is just propaganda
um and white supremacy is sort of the
the perfect
boogeyman because it has all the
qualities you want
which is people are primed to believe it
so that's the first thing you don't want
to sell a story that people are not
primed to already believe
so people want to believe that this is a
problem
i'm not saying it isn't i'm just saying
that it has these qualities
we're we're primed to believe it we have
lots of
anecdotes to support it so there will be
plenty of stories of
uh an individual who did a white
supremacist thing
or was a white supremacist so check
got that um it can't be
measured which is really important
because his claim is that it went up
under trump
how do you measure it exactly what
exactly went up
membership can you measure that
is there like some kind of published
membership logs of white supremacists
or is it the number of violent things
that happened
that were attributed to them i don't
know
but as long as you can't measure
and you're sure it's there and you see
anecdotes of it
you can very easily be convinced it's a
pretty big deal
sort of like how russia collusion was
sold to you you had just the right
elements to make you think well
i'm primed to believe it and you know
because i can't expl i can't explain how
trump could have won in 2016.
and you can't really measure it you
can't find it but you can find all these
anecdotes of
well there was that time that flynn had
a conversation
with somebody right so it has all these
all the right qualities
and then best of all it slimes all trump
supporters
so it's it's politically expedient
because it makes
republicans look bad it's kind of
perfect it checks all the boxes for the
for a perfect uh fake news narrative for
the coming years
um interestingly the idea of doing
rapid cheap testing for coronavirus
has now for some reason i don't know why
lately
could it be biden became president maybe
that's why
but suddenly it's popular major
publications are writing how
it could be a big deal and it could
change everything
but there's a whole article on it i
can't remember if it was the wall street
journal or the new york times
but the the part that i read um
doesn't mention the default assumptions
which is the fda is corrupt and that's
why
we don't already have these tests
because we've never heard a good reason
that we don't have them
there doesn't seem to be a physical
problem why we can't have them
nor is there a logical problem they just
won't allow it i think the requirements
for
reporting and something else or what the
reasons are but they're not
actual reasons they're facts
but they're not reasons that would argue
against it
so now it looks like all the smart
people are catching on
uh almost what nine months
or so at least six months after
you know michael mina and a lot of
people on social media
were saying um you either need to do
this or tell us why you're not doing
this
because it seems so obviously like a
good thing
you got to at least explain why you're
not doing it and that never happened
and still hasn't happened so
the default presumption is the fda is
deeply corrupt
and here's uh let me give you a
persuasion lesson here
here's what i tweeted about that i said
about the story about the rapid testing
i said this story doesn't address the
default assumption that some
there's some sort of massive corruption
with the fda
has prevented rapid testing so far
probably
killing a quarter million people so
that's the
that's the persuasion part do i
know that the lack of rapid testing
would have saved let's say half of the
people who have died already which would
be quarter of a million people in the
united states alone
do i know that to be true of course not
but is it fair to say it could have or
that it probably would have
well that's an opinion um but by putting
a number on it it makes it stickier for
persuasion
because you want to argue against the
number right so
so if you're on the other side you're
like quarter million
no way it's probably no more than 50 000
in which case i win the argument because
i'm arguing that we should have done it
i'm not really arguing the number so if
i can make you argue the number
250 you know 250 000 that's way too big
then i've already won the main argument
which is that we should have done it
before
apparently the biden administration has
been reaching out to north korea
to just get some talks going and north
korea has so far just ignored them
you just ignore him apparently biden is
so boring
that kim jong-un can't even be bothered
it's like well
i don't even know why i would talk to
you it's not going to be fun
and it's not going to accomplish
anything so maybe we'll just ghost you
and not even return your calls
now remember my main theme for the
coming year
that every day that goes by will make
trump
look better here's another one
at least trump could get them to return
a call trump basically
became friends with uh kim jong-un
biden can't even get a return phone call
so it's starting to look a lot like
trump did some good stuff that biden
can't reproduce
i'm watching cnn has some kind of a
special on abraham lincoln
and the theme there is that was lincoln
a racist
and i believe the answer is yes yes he
was
he was a big old racist not worse than
people
during his time so you know you have to
you have to grade on a curve
unfortunately
so he was probably way ahead of people
of his time
but still pretty darn racist by modern
standards
so watching cnn try to cancel lincoln is
pretty funny
which feels to me kind of about politics
because you know the republicans are the
party of lincoln
so if they can cancel lincoln
what a win that would be right hey you
guys still the party of lincoln
we canceled him
let me ask you this
do you think the schools should teach
cult awareness
classes this idea came from jg bennett
on twitter imagine a cult awareness
class that comes immediately after your
critical
race theory class so imagine both of
those classes they teach critical race
theory
and then right after it there's a class
on recognizing cults
well i don't think that's going to
happen because it would never get
through the teachers unions and approved
but i asked the following questions
suppose
there were some kind of a private
company
that offered the service of
deprogramming your child
from whatever occult wokeness things you
think they shouldn't be learning
in school would you buy that service
and i tweeted that and turns out a lot
of people would
now of course a lot of people say hey i
did buy that service it's called
homeschooling
so i just do it myself and
that's one way to go of course but
i'm feeling like there there will be
it feels like it's going to happen right
because there are lots of private tutors
who augment what kids are learning in
school that's
routine right why would you not have a
special kind of tutor
who just comes in every let's say once a
once a year
and just deprograms your kid so that
they're not
you know they're not uh indoctrinated
into too much of a wokeness
cult now if somebody says that prageru
does that
and i noted on twitter in response that
the trouble with prageru is that
other people think they are a cult
because they have a you know
christian background etc so
i don't know that the best deprogrammers
would be somebody
who other people think is also a cult
now that's an opinion
of course you know because we get to
decide what's a cult and what's real
but you would have more credibility if
it was someone not associated with any
organization
that somebody else says hey they're
cults they're just programming you the
other way
and i'm not saying that i'm not saying
prager is doing anything wrong i'm just
saying in terms of
brand the the brand brings a little bit
of
good and bad baggage with it and
then i wondered how long would it take
to tr to teach it
and i was thinking i could do it in one
hour
you'd only need me you know if i were
part of this
company deprogramming your child maybe
one hour
once a quarter once a year something
like that wouldn't be a lot
and then i thought well why don't i just
do a video on it
why don't i just do a video
and people can have a single single
topic video
to deprogram your child and i'll just
teach them the lessons in my book
think uh and maybe maybe a little bit
from win bigly about persuasion
but loser think is about how to identify
which is what keeps you from being
indoctrinated in a cult
if you can identify what they're doing
while they're doing it you can say oh
i see what's going on here i could teach
that in an hour
i don't think it would take much longer
because here here are the sort of things
you would learn
i would teach them do you know if it's
not reported by both the left and the
right
it's probably not true did you know
that half of the things you think are
science turn out not to be true
did you know that when they tell you to
trust the science
that you don't ever see science all you
ever see is people who have interpreted
it for you
so you never even have a chance to trust
science
it's not even an option the only thing
you have is whether you trust the person
who interpreted it for you
and why would you there's there's no law
that says you should trust
people sure you should trust science
but if the only thing you know about it
comes from people
don't trust the people so those are the
kinds of lessons
how long would it take to to
teach somebody just what i just told you
well i did it in less than a minute
it was like three important points in
less than 60 seconds
now of course you have to repeat things
and put a story around things and
you know make them sticky but i think
about an hour
you could teach kids how to fend for
themselves and recognize a cult so i'm
thinking of doing that but i don't know
if i will
all right um if you go to
fox news you'll see a big you know the
top of the page is riots and unrest in
la
seattle portland to mark the briana
taylor raid anniversary and then you go
to cnn
it's not even a story it's the top story
on
fox news top story
and cnn doesn't even cover it
so how big are these riots and the rests
it's not big enough to be on cnn
according to cnn
so when you see stuff like this you have
to say
we're definitely living in two different
movies
and harking back to my conversation
yesterday about how partisanship
actually gives you brain damage if you
were not aware
the cnn and fox news were reporting
entirely different worlds today
then you got a little brain damage just
a little bit
because you didn't know that there were
two worlds you only saw one
do you know florida has a big problem
coming up
and it's the problem of success do you
ever work
for let's say in an office you work for
a boss
and you're the efficient one and you get
your work done really fast
what is your reward for doing your work
quickly if you work for a big company
you already know the answer to this your
reward for being really good at getting
your work done is you'll be asked to
help the people who are slow
you get more work right so success
can really take you out the more
successful you are the more of a target
you are
in some cases and you know success can
kill you
and florida's got this problem where
they've been relatively successful with
the coronavirus
so where are people going to go for
spring break
to florida so florida that all of their
coronavirus success
will maybe be reversed
because they were successful and that
allows them to be opened and allows
spring breakers to go there
i feel as if florida is going to be
an interesting experiment and a lot
depends on it
a lot depends on it and here's what
here's what we hope we hope that the
spring breakers will of course they're
going to bring
a little bit more infection we don't
know how much but we hope it's not so
much
that the hospitals are impacted to the
point where they have to
do something different and close down or
lock down
i think that florida will probably
stick it out and stay open but this will
be a real good
edge case because if florida survives
spring break and doesn't have to go to
some draconian lockdown
i think the pandemic's kind of over
kind of over it's a really good test in
a way i'm glad it's happening when it's
happening
because it'll tell us a lot really
um so both biden and harris are still
quiet
on the on the question of governor cuomo
and all the allegations
from women and
what a luxury that is imagine
under the trump regime if
if he could just ignore one of the
biggest stories in the country
just just never comment on it
i don't think that would work for him
but
it's working for harrison biden they
literally do well when they don't talk
about stuff and nobody sees them
and i'm also noting do you remember
it might have been mike cernovich who
was the first one to note this
it was the first one i i saw and noted
that under the trump administration time
stopped working you notice that right
that you would say my god that happened
a year ago and it was only two weeks ago
because your sense of time was all
messed up because he did so many things
so quickly one after another
time just went back to normal ironically
it's
you know the time got changed today but
under biden
a week feels like a week doesn't it
under under trump a week felt like uh
was the beginning of the week last year
or so much has happened this week
but biden restored our clocks
like a week looks like a week now and
when i think
what did he do a month ago it feels like
it was a month ago
so biden made things boring again
just the way people wanted it
there's a story by margaret sullivan
she's writing about all the online
harassment of female journalists
and she says it's real and it's
increasingly hard to endure
and um i'm sure that's true probably
every time a woman
journalist writes something there's at
least
one guy who says he wants to
chop her up and eat her
after a sexual assault i mean there are
some bad people in the world
but here's what i wonder when i read
that article
has margaret sullivan ever seen my email
has she ever seen what people say to me
and i didn't realize this but apparently
my trolls are kind and polite
relatively speaking and i was wondering
hey why are my trolls and my critics
also kind and polite
and that i look down it's like oh oh i
have a penis
if you have a penis your
critics and trolls will not be so bad
not so bad so i kind of used my penis as
sort of like a talisman or like you
would use garlic
um for a vampire um
when the trolls come after me i just say
oh hold on trolls
hold on trolls i see where this is going
and
let me just show you something all right
everybody you see that are we good
everybody can you see that are we good
now and then the trolls go away
you know they start out with we're gonna
dismember you and and cook you and eat
you
and kill everybody you love
but then you say whoa ho ho i don't
think you saw this
did you and then they go oh
why didn't you tell us you had one of
those and then they're like
good job on dilbert and i like your i
like your
uh your tel your live stream
so try that at home
if your critics are giving you a hard
time and you're male
uh just remind them just show them your
show them your garlic um
i saw a i was pointed to
a piece from the cdc where they explain
how they
they calculate or measure the
seasonal regular flu and one of the
things that i've been asking is
why is it i never hear of anybody dying
from the regular seasonal flu
and it turns out that the cdc i guess
one of their website pages
has maybe an answer to that and it goes
like this
see if you've ever heard this before
it's amazing that we can be a year into
this pandemic stuff you think you've
heard everything that you could hear
about
viruses and stuff and then i never knew
this before
so this is what they say
that uh many seasonal flu related deaths
occur one or two weeks after a person's
initial infection
either because the person may develop a
secondary bacterial
co-inflection such as bacterial
pneumonia
or because seasonal flu can aggravate an
existing chronic illness such as consent
congestive heart failure or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease therefore
seasonal flu is frequently listed on
death certificates
of people who die from flu related
complications is infrequently listed so
in other words
you get the flu and then the flu goes
away
so you don't even have the flu but
getting the flu exacerbated your other
problems
and then you die from the other problems
and then it's not coded the flu because
at the moment you die
you don't even have the flu so
are we counting this right is that the
way you would have counted it
would you count it as a flu death
if the person who dies doesn't have the
flu
somebody says just like covet no
opposite opposite of covet
with covid you die um because the covid
and the comorbidity are there at the
same time
that's my understanding right i'm not
hearing that people are dying
two weeks later from an unrelated thing
so much maybe
maybe there's some of that too that i'm
just not hearing about but i've got a
feeling that the way that coronavirus is
killing people is that you're having two
things at the same time
the at least part of the story about why
we don't count
seasonal flu deaths the regular flu is
because
by the time the people die they don't
have any flu
for one thing but when they do estimates
they say yeah we're going to count those
even though we don't count them
individually they're going to say we're
going to count them
now when you see this do you have
confidence that we have any idea what's
going on with seasonal flu
and is that a right way to count it
would you say that the thing that
happened
just before somebody died
of something else is the cause can we
think of any other analogies like that
um let's say you uh
somebody was was saying that was at the
brady bill
and when brady was shot that he died you
know decades later
but the cause of death was that he was
shot
decades earlier and i had complications
eventually
so when you say his cause of death is
the gun
if he if he survived for you know
decades
but it really was that injury that took
him out in the end is the cause of death
the gun i don't know
how do you count that if everything had
to happen just the way it happened
why is any of it a cause it's all the
cause
it's either all the cause or none of it
right because it all had to happen or
you wouldn't get that outcome
well
and of course our military is trying to
weed out the uh
the white supremacist and i ask you this
should the military also weed out
any antifa and black lives matter
supporters
would that be just as fair as
weeding out the white supremacists let's
say white supremacists
who had not broken any laws they weren't
threatening anybody
right i feel like you have to apply the
same standard
because if any of those people have not
done any
anything that's you know illegal
then they either have to all stay there
or you have to get rid of all of them
what standard are you using to decide
who goes
if you weeded down all racists who would
be left
not many people i i feel the
the healthiest thing that people could
uh take as a
a way to reframe their reality is that
and i've said this a number of times but
i'll just keep saying until until sinks
in
you don't have the option of not being a
racist
you don't have that option because your
brain is a pattern recognition machine
nobody would disagree with that we we
see patterns
and then we act on the patterns it's the
most basic thing your brain does
but the problem is we're not good at it
we operate on patterns but we see false
patterns as easily as we see real ones
and then you got your racism so
saying that there are people who are not
racist is sort of a
misunderstanding of how the brain works
it's a pattern recognition machine it's
just not good at it
and therefore you get bias and racism
and everything else
so the the better way to look at it is
there's
there's some more modern brain theory
that says you're not one person
but that your your personality is
actually a
sort of a contest between parts of your
brain
so there's one part of your brain that
wants to you know eat because it's
hungry
but another part wants to get your work
done first another part is afraid
so you've got all these almost like
micro personalities
within your head and all them are
competing
some of them or at least one
is a racist every one of your heads
there's no exceptions
so and that's the part that you know
forms patterns but isn't very good at it
so it forms bigoted patterns as well so
this is whacked
so i think the healthiest thing we could
do is to
acknowledge that it's not possible to be
non-racist it doesn't matter who you are
doesn't matter what you know ethnicity
you are you don't have that option
nobody has that option what you do have
is the option of creating
laws that can minimize it as much as
possible
you do have the option of using your
higher reasoning
to overcome it when you see it in
yourself to be more alert
you know when it's when it's sort of
sneaking out and you didn't know you
were doing it
and then other people say hey hey that
was a little bit woke
uh let me give you a a little homework
you ready uh here's some homework
go watch some old videos on youtube
of what used to be called the friar's
roasts
now the friars was a group i think they
were mostly
celebrity actors and stuff and comedians
and they would get together
on a regular basis it was a sort of
old-timey tv
and they would just pick some famous
person and they would roast them so it'd
be all
insults about the person so i've been
what i've been binge watching
these old friar things just for the
historical
fun of it and you would be amazed
how many things you couldn't show on tv
that they just did routinely in those
days
you would be amazed i would i would say
that one of the dominant
joke themes is calling whoever was being
roasted
uh calling them gay
and i'm thinking to myself what
like it like it doesn't even make sense
when you watch it anymore you're like
why is that an insult like our modern
brain can't even understand why this is
in the program at all
but in those days they could stand on
television
and they could they could diminish
somebody
in a laughing way by suggesting that
they
are gay and
you know i'm i think i am pretty
compatible with most of the people
watching this and saying that the
wokeness has gone too far
blah blah blah blah but
as much as i'm empathetic to the fact
that the wokeness has gone too far
when you watch these old shows and you
watch them just
just basically putting down gay people
just as a joke just as a
joke
it's not funny it's really not funny
when you watch it
and i don't know if i i don't have a
specific memory if i ever laughed at it
when
when you know i watched it as a kid i
don't think so
because they don't look like they would
have been funny even back then
but there there is definitely
uh i think if you reject
all of the wokeness that's
that's going too far there is something
good
in the wokeness and this would be a
perfect example do you want to live in a
world
where there could be just a tv show that
everybody's watching
in which somebody is just using the way
somebody was born
right they're born into the lgbtq
world and using that as an insult
for somebody else you don't want to live
in that world do you not at all
so um if you want to get
just a better feel for
why the wokeness even exists you know
there are lots of reasons for it but
watching how bad it was when i was a kid
will really wake you up so to speak
wake you up to how bad it was and maybe
you just didn't even realize it at the
time but it was pretty bad
pretty darn bad
people use fat as an insult
yeah you know but fat is one of those uh
sort of a strange case and um
you know i've used the word too but i
don't use it as an
insult per se uh
i think you use it as a description and
i don't believe there's anybody who
is overweight who thinks that's their
first choice
like yeah want to be overweight um
so it's somebody says fat is
controllable
it's controllable to an extent but
there's definitely a difference in how
much people
like food and that that difference
comes through
um yeah even foster brooks was a famous
old comedian in those friars rose
and his act was he would act like he was
drunk
and he would just do his act like he's
drunk and i'm thinking
i don't even know if you could do that
today because today we see
addiction as a medical problem it's not
funny
it's not cute just a medical problem
so i think even that would be different
yeah dean martin would act drunk as well
um all right so that's all i got for
today
uh there's a police video somebody says
some babies are born that way now when i
say
that weight is a function of
you know differences among people
what i mean is that some people just
enjoy food
differently uh i can control my weight
relatively easily because yesterday for
example
the whole day i thought to myself i
don't feel like eating
i just i just went a whole day without
not once feeling like eating
i mean i did because i need to but i
didn't want to
there wasn't one time i wanted to eat
yesterday now
how many people who have a weight
problem could say that's even happened
to them
once that you could go whole day
and not once did you feel like you
really wanted to eat
right these are different things i i'm
not a hero because i can keep my weight
under control
i just don't like food as much that's
all it is
by the way i learned that from my
hypnosis instructor it was one of the
best lessons i ever learned
that my hypnosis instructor had a weight
problem himself
and when he talked about how hypnosis is
no good for
helping people with their weight he
explained it this way
he said you can't hypnotize somebody to
do something they
fundamentally don't want to do and if
they think the hypnosis is going to make
them lose weight
and they haven't decided to lose weight
they just want the hypnosis to do it for
them
it'll never work the deciding is the
whole
is the active part if you decide to lose
weight then you're going to
take whatever pain it takes because
you've already said whatever it takes
doesn't matter how much it hurts i've
decided i'm just going to do this now
then hypnosis would work but so would
every other method it's really the
deciding that made the difference
but my hypnosis instructor said this he
goes
you want to know why i'm fat he used the
word
himself he goes you want to know why i'm
fat
he goes i like food if you complicate it
you don't need to that's the whole story
he said i'm fat because i like food
if you like food as much as i do you'd
be fat once you understand
that
somebody says i'm done this guy is
boring
and he's lying well only one of those is
true
i'm not lying about anything i'm just
boring
but i'm going to solve your problem boom
you'll never have to deal with me again
i like it when i can
solve problems
um somebody says i believe the emotion
is at the base and not the deciding
i don't believe that i don't believe
that
i don't believe the emotion
slash eating connection except that some
people like to eat more
all right that's all for now and i'll
talk to you later tomorrow
the news is very boring lately it's not
my fault
but it'll get better tomorrow
your gut biome affects your weight well
here's the thing
um i saw this this statement from
uh let's see who was it the british
actor
michael i forget his name um
but he said why is it that when you see
photos of
you know starving people none of them
are fat
right so his point is if it's not how
much you eat
then why are there no people starving to
death while still fat like people
who you know tragically were in
concentration camps and stuff
so there's no question that eating less
reduces your weight
we have countless examples of people
starving to death and none of them died
fat
you know they they all got thin first so
uh put that in your calculations
all right that's all i got for now talk
to you later
