good morning everybody
welcome
to the most amazing
hour you're likely to ever spend
in your entire life
it's called coffee with scott adams and
normally
it's tremendous on an average day it's
better than anything you've ever
experienced
but today
even the normal coffee with scott adams
experience is going to go to a new level
it will
yeah and if you'd like to get us started
off right
and by the way
you might need a little swaddling for
your brain
find a nice warm
blanket
unless you're exercising
if you're running on the beach right now
and you hear me laughing in your ear as
you're running in the beach and you're
saying damn it he's making me laugh when
i'm running on the beach
i think he's talking about me
and i am
so keep running on the beach but the
rest of you get a nice warm blanket
because you're going to need to swallow
your brain
swaddle it
but first
how about a simultaneous sip but all you
need is a copper a margarita glass a
tanker chelsea's time to canteen jogger
flask vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid
a beverage some would say
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope being the other day
the thing that makes
everything better and i mean everything
in every reality better
it's called the simultaneous step and it
happens now go
well
would you like to see the matrix
you know some people think that we live
in a simulation and if this were a
simulation you would be subject to
resource constraints wouldn't it
if we were any kind of computer
simulation
the one thing you could be reasonably
sure of
is it would have some kind of limits
because everything has to have a limit
just logically
and so
could we ever spot the limits of our own
simulation
as evidence that that's what we're in
and here's the frame that i'm going to
give you for today's entire episode
and it goes like this
did you ever wonder why
cognitive dissonance
is so common
or to put it more generally why people
have completely different views of
reality
and it doesn't just apply
doesn't just apply
to the news
don't you know that sometimes you'll be
talking to your friends you've known
forever and you'll have completely
different memories of events in which
you both were there
what's up with that
why do we have memory
but
our memory is so close to fantasy
that sometimes you can't even
unentangle them
why do we so often live
in what seems like a completely
different worlds
and here's the answer
it has to be that way
because of resource constraints
cognitive dissonance
isn't a flaw
it's a feature
you couldn't program the simulation
without that requirement
here's why
imagine creating a simulation and by the
way if those of you who have programmed
back me up on this
all right
if you were creating a simulation in
which every character's actions
had to be known to every other
object and item in the entire universe
because they might someday interact
and someday you might hear about
something that somebody else did
and it has to be consistent
if our memories were perfect it would
have to be consistent
so if you tried to build
an artificial world in which everybody's
story
their narrative if you will
or their subjective reality
if they had to be consistent
in all ways with all other stories
the resources would be
astronomical to the point where it's
unimaginable that it could be programmed
but
could you build a world
in which people believed they were
seeing an accurate
view of the reality
but in fact
the accuracy was only a trick of the
mind
that'd be a lot easier
so
watch if you will the predictive power
of
the simulation hypothesis
do i tell you that the simulation is the
true way to see the world
never
nope
the only thing i could tell you is that
some ways of looking at things might be
more predictive than others and that's
probably the closest you can get to
something that's
real
if anything is
so my prediction is this
there can never be a major story
that has only one interpretation
you always
there could be exceptions of course but
let's say in general that the headlines
will always tend toward two
interpretations even when
it's not just a democrat republican
thing
because take vaccinations for example
you saw that a lot of let's say the
black population and the republicans
were
often on the same page so it wasn't even
a left right thing
but every story
has to have multiple interpretations
because that's the only way you could
program the simulation let's talk about
a few things that are happening now
one is the continued continuing
of what i call the roganization of the
news
the roganization of the news is another
indication that we live in a simulation
that we're reusing themes because it's
just simpler it uses less resources
so the way we see the news used to be
through a trump filter
and now we see it through a joe rogan
filter
so if we talk about vaccinations we talk
about joe rogan if it's about
ivermectin joe rogan you know the
government uh taking away our rights joe
rogan
freedom of speech
joe rogan
and now even
music and streaming
joe rogan
now some of it is just you get something
in your mind and his sticks and he's
gigantic
uh in terms of his reach so it makes
sense
in the same way it made sense that we
talked about everything through a trump
filter
but think about how that simplifies the
programming
we all just think the same way we just
go through the same filter
it's a big simplification if you were
going to program a simulation so here's
what else is happening
the story is that the following four
people and before you fact-check me i'm
going to fact check myself when i'm done
that the following four people have said
they don't want to be on spotify the
streaming service if that joe rogan
is on there with his misinformation
about health-related things
so it started with neil young
but now then we heard that barry manilow
joined and then we heard that uh peter
frampton was on board and then joni
mitchell
how much of that story is true
it's like every story right
there's a true version and a fake
version and
so here's the the details barry manilow
came out and said i don't know i don't
know where that started it didn't come
from me
didn't come from anybody who represents
me
so the the barry manilow part of the
story was completely fake so at least 25
percent of the story is fake
and then there's a peter frampton tweet
in which he said he's always been an
apple guy
so you know he he uses apple streaming
and i said to myself wait a minute
is peter frampton saying he doesn't want
to be on spotify
is he saying he's never been on spotify
or is he saying that he's not even
talking as a
creator anymore because i don't know the
last time he published any music
but is he talking as a consumer
is he just saying that he didn't use
spotify before to listen to music
i i feel like peter frampton trended
just because he says
he listens to music on a different
streaming service
i think that's what happened now if
that's true if i'm interpreting it
correctly and again
you know we're all going to have
different stories it has to be that way
uh that would be 50 of the story isn't
real
so that would leave joni mitchell
on the side of neil young
and if if you take joni mitchell's music
off of spotify
um
well you won't be able to go to spotify
to hear joni mitchell's uh big hit
uh
joni mitchell's big hit
she was really big when i was young
had a lot of hits actually she was very
famous
and then her big hit was
i don't know but i'm going to miss it
i'm going to miss it is what i'm saying
i'd i never used spotify before
uh i was kind of a
different streaming guy but
in case you want to put that in the
headlines i think i should be trending
wait a minute i'm on spotify
aren't i
i'm on spotify am i not
can somebody confirm that
i think i am right
yeah i mean
we i just published the podcast wherever
i think so i think it's on there
well
why the hell did nobody ask me if i am
willing to be on spotify
with my highly valuable
podcast which probably gets roughly as
many listens as
neil young but
i feel that i've been overlooked
am i wrong
should i make a public statement now
i think i'm going to have to i'm going
to have to go on the record
i think everybody who is on spotify
needs to
give their joe rogan opinion
and uh uh
i'm
i'm embarrassed
to be on spotify honestly
uh now that i know that barry manilow is
still on there
so
i refuse
i refuse to be on spotify
i would like my representation to pull
all of my podcasts immediately
because i just
go cabana it's not really music is it
it's not music it's sort of like a
an ear worm
that gets in your head and makes you
happy and you can't get it out
now i personally have spent
many many hours
as a
bus boy
in my early days
when i was a busboy and we would clean
the dining room all at the same time
after all the guests had left it was a
hotel
and they would play
copacabana over and over again through
the uh ceiling speakers because we only
had a few songs for whatever reason
and i've heard more copacabana than any
human has ever heard and
i don't know if i can be on spotify with
that man
excellent music
very successful
but you got to draw the line somewhere
um edward snowden
had a funny tweet he said nobody has a
stronger opinion about
nobody has stronger opinions about joe
rogan than people who have never
listened to joe rogan
and i thought
you know i bet that's exactly true
you know this is one of those tweets
where you say to yourself well that's
not i'm sure that's not true
completely and then you think about it
and then you think now that might be
actually true for every single human
in the conversation it might literally
be true of everybody
who who is against him is that you
haven't heard the context
now i don't know how many of you could
say the same
but i feel like i've been following his
career
since the earliest days literally on
news radio
and
do you remember that he had a show i
can't remember the name of the show
you'll probably tell me in which he
looked into stuff like uh bigfoot
he actually went looking for bigfoot
who remembers that what was the name of
the show
you'll remember you i think you'll
remind me
no it wasn't fear factor
what was it
come on it it wasn't on for a long time
oh joe grogan questions everything was
that it joe rogan's questions everything
right
so
now i'm not i'm not going to
characterize joe rogan's opinion about
bigfoot
you know who knows what he was thinking
when or or what
but
if you know
that part of his arc
you know include literally being an
actor literally being a you know huge
stand-up comic
uh
and literally at one point searching for
bigfoot all in the name of entertainment
right
if you understand that
then don't you have a better
appreciation of any other content that
he presents
which is that the larger context is
if it's interesting i'm going to put it
on
i don't think there's any other is there
another criteria
does he claim and does he claim any
other
any other criteria for putting on
entertainment this just has to be good
right either it has to be funny
it has to be interesting
provocative
something it just has to be good
so if you understand that the context is
things that are interesting then you
listen to the rogue doctor and you make
your own decision
you know you're not you're not watching
it like the news but what if you've only
seen clips of his show you don't know
anything about his history his other
work you know maybe you don't even know
he's a stand-up comic
don't you think a lot of people were his
critics maybe you know
vaguely know he's done that kind of work
but don't know he would be one of the
biggest in the country at the moment
so you know i think the context makes a
big difference not only the context
within the show but the the larger
context that if it's interesting he's
going to let us see it
and who how do you complain about that
right if you know the larger context if
it's interesting i think i'll show it to
you
what the hell
how do you get mad at that
form your you know make your own opinion
he's not telling you what to think
if he told you what to think that'd be a
whole different conversation wouldn't it
but
nowhere
nowhere are you going to find anything
in his record
that tells you what to think
fact-check me on that
right
i'm pretty sure if you scour his record
you're not going to find him telling you
how to think he's just going to show you
interesting and you make up your
own mind
it's a good model
well
um those of you who have uh experienced
doing mushrooms you know that
you have a much better understanding of
our reality as being a subjective
reality so even if you discard this
simulation
hypothesis
you probably would agree that we are
living in our own subjective reality
in lots of different ways and we'll talk
about some of those ways
number one is
uh many people have lived for the last
two years
in a subjective reality in which the
elites
are using covet as a plot to take
control
for the great reset
and it was never a problem
etc
others and again i'm not i don't have an
opinion on that
right now i mean i have opinions but
not right now my larger point is that
didn't we live in different worlds
there are some people who just said hey
there's a deadly virus
people doing the best they can but
people are weasels and liars and so this
is what you get
so that was my reality
my reality is just a whole bunch of
weasels and liars
doing the best they could usually for
themselves
and this is what you get when when you
have weasels and liars and a crisis
along with lots of people doing trying
to do the right thing
it wasn't like everybody was lying
but it's not like everybody was telling
the truth
it's not like everybody was trying to
get an advantage on other people
some people were literally just trying
to help
and nothing else
and a lot of people right you know
that's the best thing that came out of
the pandemic by far
is the kindness
that was expressed pretty much
universally
at least by the citizens
so
those are different worlds that we've
been living in for the last two years
how about um
what happens
if we are a simulation and the way we
think
affects it
here's something that worries me because
i worry about weird things
what if we wish a new variant into
existence
what happens if everyone in the world
expects
a new deadly variant just because we've
been primed that way
can we actually make that happen can we
just will it into existence
you know i worry about that
like actually literally because i i
think our understanding of the reality
we live in such as it is is so weak
you know what we actually understand
about reality is so weak
that i wouldn't discount
seven billion people expecting exactly
the same thing to happen
having no causal
effect
like it might not have enough causal
effect
that i could believe but it's hard to
believe it would have none
even if the only thing it did is affect
somehow the way we we acted because you
know that you're drawn toward things you
think about a lot
your behavior
is attracted this is whatever you're
thinking about the most
just some somewhat automatically and
subconsciously so could we just think
our way into problems
i don't know
but i would but i'd like to at least
give us give a
consideration
to thinking our way out of it instead
and maybe maybe focus a little more on
february 1 being over
now you see the you see the the real
power of that
what happens when everybody says
february 1's the day we stop or at least
with mandates in the united states
could have the opposite effect
could it have an effect that doesn't
seem to be directly related to the
public rising up in other words
could the virus just burn out
as if by magic
because everybody was focusing on the
same time to make it burn out i don't
know
but i'll tell you that i have this one
observation there's no scientific
backing right so this is not a science
but maybe you could you know
compare it to your own situation
i find that the more um
clearly i can visualize something
potentially happening
the more likely it'll happen
in my actual life
if if i can see it as clear as i can see
a photograph in front of me in some
sometimes i can
then it just always happens even if it's
unlikely
yeah i use my example all the time of
becoming a best-selling author or
becoming a cartoonist you know famous
cartoonist
or visiting the
the white house and talking to a
president
these are things which i visualized
really specifically
and there are other things that i just
sort of want
but i don't really visualize them and
they don't happen
but the things that i think about
specifically
oh my god do they happen on a regular
basis in a weird way
so i just want to put it out there that
that if you all focus on
hashtag february 1 for dropping mandates
which is similar to saying that the you
know the pandemic itself the crisis has
abated
i ca i'm not going to tell you it'll
make it happen
but
if you want to play it safe
if you want to play a safe
i'd rather think about stopping it than
having it forever
all right
um
here's a bombshell that's gonna scramble
your brain uh the australia i saw this
on a tweet by a twitter user called
logic
bombshell reports from australia
australia media places the blame for the
pandemic
on fouchy
in other words
the united states
so there's at least you know one person
in i don't know how many more believe
this
but talk about a reframe that made my
brain hurt
as soon as soon as i heard it from
somebody else's point of view
we just spent two years blaming china
we just spent two years blaming china
which you know i'm all on board with
that because
you know
i'm no lover of the chinese government
but
at the same time we were slowly learning
you know
fouchy's involvement and somehow it
never occurred to me
and i would wonder if this is blowing
your mind as well
why had it never occurred to me
that's the united statesist
that's responsible for the
pandemic
i'm not saying we are
i'm not saying we are
i'm saying here's here's the part i'm
only saying
why didn't it occur to me until until
now
why did that literally not occur to me
i had only thought of it as a fouchy
problem
did the same thing happen to you
did you think oh there's a fouchy
problem i never once said to myself this
is the united states
we unleashed
this pandemic by our actions now does
china have some culpability probably
probably i'm not going to let china off
the hook
but why did i never once think of it
this way
and i'm going going to introduce a
new phrase for you
and this new phrase
is going to act like a
an anti-virus
so it's a phrase
that if it catches on would act like an
anti-virus so that the problem i just
described which is my own cognitive
blindness which some of you shared
so i was cognitively blind to america's
culpability or potential culpability
because you know nothing's proven proven
in this world
and it's because of what i'm going to
call a diversion narrative
a diversion narrative
watch what happens when you start
looking for them
and you see how many times there's a
narrative about what's true
that's really designed primarily as a
diversion
what hap what would
what would it do to your brain if you
found out that the china is to blame
narrative was always a diversion
narrative
what if someone in the government or
someone's
always knew that this could come around
and become a blame america problem
because they knew that chain of events
from fouchy to funding
to wuhan to
maybe a mistake we don't know for sure
what if somebody cooked up the diversion
narrative to say it was china so that we
would in america be cognitively blind to
our own culpability
have you ever seen anybody cook up a
diversion narrative before
how about um trump-russia collusion
that's a diversion narrative
for the fact that hillary was
was literally colluding with russia
apparently
all right i'll say allegedly or
apparently
how often are diversion narratives
really all we're seeing
and how often are we just wrong or
because because my usual interpretation
of these things is that there are two
worlds because there's a democrat side
and a republican side so we all
understand that part
but some of these go beyond that
it seems like there's something else
going on besides just the teams these
diversion narratives seem to be
almost the operating system of
civilization at this point
it's just diversion narratives
let's talk about
some more as we go
um
but uh here's something that i've said a
number of times and i just want to
explain my thinking on it better because
often i'm talking about a topic in the
news then we we all get diverted about
the topic but really i'm trying to say
something about the way we think about
things so if you'll allow me
to divorce myself from the topic of
something whether it's true or false
all right forget about what's true
i don't care about that at the moment it
has has to do with a tweet i saw this
morning from a
twitter user who calls himself still
unvaccinated phd
and he's he's responding to my thought
that the category of rogue experts
are generally wrong
and he says rogue doctors and scientists
as adam says likes to call them are
often the ones who discover huge
breakthroughs in different industries
now i agree with that
don't you all wouldn't you say that the
rogues you know the ones bucking the
standard
pretty much create everything good
when you agree
i mean
they're all rogues you know all the ones
that really make a difference they're
all rogues
so
have i ever said anything
that would be conflicting with that
i've never said anything that conflicts
with the fact that pretty much all
progress seems to come from
rogues and sometimes whistleblowers
right
but
is there any conflict with that
with the fact that i say that ninety
percent of the time the rogues are wrong
there's you shouldn't think there's any
conflict with that and here's an analogy
that's just used to help you
see the math better i guess
it goes like this
you know about google and you know about
amazon.com and you know about you know
microsoft and you know about all these
gigantic companies that at one point
were
just startups
if you saw them when they were startups
you would have said well the odds are at
best one in 10.
that's optimistic it's probably one in
20.
but let's say one in 10.
so if you're looking at all startups as
90 of them are going to fail and you can
be pretty sure that's true but the ones
that become famous are so famous
that the narrative of the famous ones
makes you cognitively blind
to the fact that most things that are
like that
most things that are in their category
the category of
rogues taking on the world and winning
you know jeff bezos is a great example
taking on the world and winning
um
so just just know that everything
important comes from the rogues
but mostly they fail
so i use it as a prediction shortcut
so whenever there's a rogue
i just say well i'm gonna i'm gonna go
with the ninety
i'll vote against it
i'll vote against it
so when i when i tell you that i've got
suspicions about let's say a doctor
malone or mcauliffe
dr corey any of the names you've seen
that are the rogue doctors if as i like
to call them i'm not necessarily
disagreeing with anything about their
science
how would i know
i'm just saying they're in the category
that if you and i are going to take a
bet
i'll bet with the 90
it's just a category
a category related prediction that's all
right i i obviously obviously can't
um
counteract their science
all
right um
jack passovek has another uh tweet
and
maybe uh maybe a a scoop i don't know
but uh he tweets that biden chief of
staff ron claim is planning to start
leaking and pushing a narrative a
narrative you say
what kind of a narrative
that president zielenski
of ukraine is a kremlin compromised this
is according to a white house staffer
and again jack's got good sources
so
here's the two worlds
do you see reality just splitting
so i have to admit that when you see
zelinski being
less
worried about his country being invaded
than the united states
it's a perfectly reasonable question
why is zolensky less worried than we are
right
but there's not just one way to explain
that
one explanation is that he is just as
worried but he wants to play it
differently he doesn't want to cause
panic so we don't know he's less worried
he's talking about how how we talk about
it
he so he doesn't want the rhetoric to be
as high as it is
but
this might create an opening for this
second narrative that zelensky is a
puppet of the kremlin and he's
practically inviting them in
and then the other narrative that
nothing like that is happening
so once again
two worlds
does the simulation require
that in every case
and i'm not even sure this is a democrat
or republican question is it
because i think you could find people on
both sides of what we should do on uh on
ukraine
but everything has to be at least two
stories or more
because the the simulation can't handle
complexity
with one story
if you're coming in late
if we live in the simulation there's got
to be a resource constraint like any
computer
and so there's a reason that we all have
different realities because you couldn't
have one reality and make every part of
every reality consistent with every
other too much resources too many
resources
so so the prediction of the simulation
is that every major story
will branch into multiple uh realities
and that has to happen
you can't program the simulation unless
you do that
um
here is my
mind breaking white board for today
the thing you've all been waiting for
but you didn't even know it i call it
the military financial reframe
and it goes like this
that
if you look at the arc of time
that power used to be really a military
thing which of course was highly
correlated with wealth
you know wealth could get you a better
military but not necessarily
so if you had a great military you had a
lot of power
if you had money that was great money
was great but if all you had was money
and you didn't have a good military
the military next door would come and
take your money
but thanks primarily to the internet
and our financial markets becoming
global and inter intertangled and the
fact that money has to go through
basically wires to get anywhere it
doesn't get on a boat it's not hidden
somewhere has to go across a wire
so we became so connected with each
other because of the internet
that finance as a weapon
gets more and more powerful the more
connected we are and the more trade we
do
and so
i would submit to you that ukraine is
our crossover point
the crossover point at which a financial
weapon is more useful
than a military weapon because the
military weapon would guarantee russia's
destruction am i right
so it pretty much guarantees they're not
going to go nuclear
so the the value of the ar their arsenal
is
not really that good
so here here they are in nuclear power
they can't really use their nukes
so
that brings them down to you know what
weapons can you use
in these smaller conflicts
and so finance is everything and so when
biden says
you can line up your military on the
border if you want
but at your own peril
it's time
for
the military financial
crossover point boom
now i submit to you that i do not know
if ukraine is the point in history at
which the experts will say yup that's
when it happened
from that day on the the larger powers
just resolve things
through negotiating because it was
you know you had to use your financial
tools
still there will be plenty of wars with
these smaller countries with neighboring
conflicts and stuff but anybody who's a
big enough country to have a submarine
i'll just use that as my standard
if your country is big enough to have a
submarine in your military
probably you're going to work it out
financially because you can be taken
down by the rest of the world
now
like i say i don't know if ukraine is
going to be the test case
that proves the rule forever
but the day will come
you know if it's not ukraine this taiwan
or you know
it's something but but something is
going to prove this rule
i i think china taiwan is a different
situation because of the history there
but
i don't see the russia-ukraine situation
becoming a major shooting war so test my
prediction
um my prediction is
that ukraine probably is the point where
the shooting war just stopped making
sense
now i will not rule out
will not rule out minor incursion
minor incursion
and continued pressure and you know
cyber and everything else that stuff
probably
but i don't see
the russian military moving in force
like a major campaign
and the reason is too expensive
can't afford it
and putin is not irrational so he would
do a slow but steady pressure
probably get what he wants in the end
you know that's why i think a lot
so test that
um i think
the
all the talk about nato and the us and
sending some of her
forces over there and trainers and
sending military and all that i think a
lot of that is just theater
um and i felt like our own military
was saying that
you know they were saying that we're not
doing it um
so much to fight russia
we're doing it to show our allies that
we back them
so it was really theater
and i think we said it directly well
it's sort of theater we're just showing
the allies that we back them
we're not really putting a fighting
force there
because what would a fighting force look
like
a fighting force would look like a real
fighting force i don't think we have
anything like that
in the neighborhood right
so it's really just for show
and i think that our military leaders to
their credit
to their credit i think they said so
directly
and they said it multiple times this is
to show
our allies that we have their back it's
a show
okay
so i don't know that that show is
something we have to worry about
militarily
um all right here's my next provocative
question
um and i'll start with this priming of
your brain uh are all of you aware
there's a generally accepted
parenting practice
that if you're a step parent you don't
do the discipline
are you all familiar with that rule
is this generally a universally
acknowledged rule now the thinking
behind it is fairly solid
the thinking behind it is that there is
a biological connection
for a biological parent
that is a sort of unbreakable
bond and that you have this um
you know unrestricted love that won't be
changed by some some punishment
but
it is assumed
that the non-biological parent doesn't
have that and so if punishment comes
from a non-biological parent
that could become a rift that lasts
forever and becomes a problem
now
i'm not saying every family is the same
you know i think there's a world of
difference
between a step kid that you get as a
baby and the original parent was never
in the picture
that's effectively just a biological
parent for all for all practical
purposes right but i'm talking about
like a step kid comes in at age 12.
okay that's a different situation
and and the real father let's say you're
still in the picture and involved right
you in that case
in that case the step dad just you just
have to step away you you report
observe and report that's it observe and
report unless it's you know an immediate
danger
if it's an immediate danger then you
step in immediately
but
um i'm gonna i'm gonna take that analogy
to a weird place
our constitution has a rule in it that
you have to be born in america to be
president
you have to be born in america to be
president not for other jobs
but to be president
do you what do you think of that rule
does that does that
rule feel appropriate
or does it feel racist
because it is racist
i mean an outcome
right it's racist
um let me give you an example
do you think that arnold schwarzenegger
would be a risky president in the sense
that he would have too much loyalty to
his native-born austria
well actually if we ever got into
conflict with austria i would be worried
about that i definitely would be worried
about that but you know we'll never get
in a conflict with austria not
realistically
so
why is there why is there a
constitutional
thing that prevents arnold from running
for president
there's no real reason i mean it just
ends up looking racist
in his case
but
do you agree with the general statement
that people estab
they develop a love
for the place they were born
just ordinarily it's just the most
natural
i don't must be biological
i guess some of it is or a lot of it is
cultural
but people are very bonded to where
they're born so
would most of you have now given the
background would you all agree that the
country is safer
and i'm not even talking about america
specifically
or would you give any country
probably is a little safer
if they restrict their presidents to
people born on the soil of any of any
you know cultural background of course
yeah most of you would agree with that
as a reasonable
but a little bit racist
but it's national defense and that's
where we bend things a little bit when
when we have to
right you elon musk perfect example
would you be worried if elon musk were
president if we were not born in
american soil i wouldn't
i wouldn't i wouldn't be worried about
that at all it just seems kind of racist
that he's but but we still accept i
think
that a president should be born on the
soil of which that president is the
president it just gives you that little
extra
little extra protection
this brings us to george soros
who uh was hungor
is hungarian-born but american citizen
now he can't run for president
are you happy about that
are you happy that george soros with all
of his money can't run for president
it's just it's not even an option
i'm saying most people say yes they're
glad that
in this case they're glad that that rule
exists
because he did he did have enough money
if you think about it
he did have enough money that if it were
constitutionally allowed he probably
could have made the grade
probably could have gotten over the hump
because money i mean you can buy
anything
so
we're happy about it there but here's
the provocative question
why do we allow that same person that we
would not trust as a president
to donate so much money to activist
organizations
that they effectively control our
government
on those issues
why is that okay
and am i being racist to even ask the
question
because i don't think it's more racist
than our current constitutional
situation it's probably equal
they're both racist
i'm just asking the question
that's the podcaster's dodge
i'm just asking the question but in this
case i think that's fair to say
i actually wonder
why do we allow that
why is it legal
no i get that it's constitutional so
it's not a constitutional question right
now
why do we allow that
we have all kinds of campaign finance
restrictions
but why do we
not restrict
something that is so important to us
it's in the constitution
it's built right into the constitution
it's so fundamental that you want
somebody who's
let's say biological connection to the
soil is unquestionable
somebody says it's not racist it's
nationalistic
that's a fair characterization
but i would say that uh almost
everything we do has a racist outcome
even if you don't intend it for that
purpose it just always does
so i don't think it's you know i just
like mentioning because it gets this one
less thing for people to complain about
right
so
i think i think maybe a republican
should
run on that
if there's a way to do it now it might
be impossible to stop money
because soros could give money to an
entity and say i'm done with it and then
the entity could say well now that we
have this money it's ours and we'll give
it to this cause
so
i'm guessing he could probably still
launder it somehow and there's no way to
stop it i don't know
must be a way to do it
but
don't even try
you know if we're if we're concerned
about foreign influence so much that we
can't have a foreign-born president
you know so we're so concerned that
arnold
schwarzenegger couldn't can't be our
president who's worried about him being
not pro-american enough or even elon
musk i mean i don't you know who knows
what elon musk is thinking that's that
would be impossible to imagine
but i wouldn't be worried
all right
um
here's the answer to the question why i
stay in california because people always
ask
i'm going to read i'm just going to read
this headline from twitter
the nor'easter storm will bring a major
snowstorm and potential blizzard
stretching from south carolina to new
england
the storm is predicted to
form off the coast of the carolinas on
friday and move north up the east coast
across the weekend a storm has brought
the east coast into its first blizzard
warning in four years according to blah
blah
airlines have canceled thousands of
flights high winds heavy snows between 6
and 12 inches of snow
one to two feet of snow in some places
and maybe maybe major power outages at
the same time people be freezing to
death in their own homes
so that's what uh that's what the people
in those states are doing
um yesterday
uh i took a walk in the sun
had some legal cannabis before i went
uh it was t-shirt weather
beautiful
day so if you don't mind
if you don't mind the you know
the high taxes and the crime and the
drought and the forest fires that are
blotting out the sun
if you don't mind that stuff
it's a pretty good place to be and if
you can stay away from the
uh the tsunamis
and
the earthquakes but you know i know
where all the faults are
i just stay away from the falls
um
did you know there's a depopulation time
bomb facing the west
and one wonders is there a reason we're
talking about a depopulation time bomb
that we've known about for a long time
now some of it may be it's just reaching
that you know critical point where
everybody notices might be because elon
musk has brought it up
um but
the west is hitting a uh this problem
china's going to get it first because
that one
one baby problem or policy they had for
over 35 years or something
so
deaths are going to outstrip births and
pretty soon we'll have all these old
people
that require all this care and we won't
have enough young people to work and
take care of them
i think that maybe technology and
civilization will adjust
i think we'll adjust
i think that a lot of those old people
live in houses and they'll just say hey
and this is something already happening
they'll say hey young person come live
rent free in my house and you do some of
the work and
we both win
so
i think that the first thing that will
happen is civilization will just
immediately adjust because we're real
good at that we we adjust
probably the single thing that makes
humans the dominant species uh over the
planet uh although fungi are doing
pretty well
but you know humans we're having a good
run
is because we adjust so well you know
other
is it uh brett weinstein who says this
um it's our ability to adjust that makes
us special
i think his new book says that
um
so i think we'll adjust
but it's important watch it
and what is behind uh this depopulation
time bomb well
it's a number of factors economic
social
uh but cnn is also reporting that we are
too fat to
that wasn't their exact headline
but i think once i read this to you
you'll think that
the headline too fat to
kind of fits so cnn says that 43 of
women and 31 percent of men
have some form of dis sexual dysfunction
with obesity and lack of exercise often
being factors
now i do not do fat shaming
because i don't think anybody chooses
bad health
right i just don't think anybody does
that and i don't think people choose to
be addicts i don't think we choose to be
a lot of things that it looks like we
choose but we really don't
so i don't make fun of people who are in
whatever situation they're in because
you know if i don't have this one
problem well i got my own right
so i tend not to uh
and i use i used to be far more
judgmental i would say
this is more of a recent evolution in my
case
so i feel not judgmental about other
people's issues
because i don't see my own as being all
solved
if i could solve all of my issues like
everything that could be solved well
then i'll talk about yours
and now why don't you be like me and
solve all your problems i solved all the
mine
but as long as my problems aren't all
solved
like your problems are fine you know
we'll we'll talk about them but it's not
about you okay
so we'll talk about the problem but it's
not about you personally
this is a big deal
and again
this is this gigantic path for somebody
like a desantis to walk right through
how many people would like to see an
american president
and and the reason i say desantis is he
makes every right move
like he reads the room better than
anybody's ever read the room and well
trump read the room pretty well too but
the other thing desantis does is he
responds to it but he also takes free
money
free money is the thing that anybody
could have said
but he says
you know trump used to do that all the
time if there's a thing you can say
and it's just sort of obvious anybody
could say it but only one person does
it's like why did everybody leave this
free money lay in there
so the free money this gigantic
is you've got this enormous health and
obesity problem in this country
how about a president
how about a desantis
says look let's not kid ourselves
you know i can do everything in the
world to help this country but if you're
overeating and not taking care of
yourself
it's not going to mean anything to you
so please let's figure out how to like
get in shape let's figure out a system
let's get some help let's put some money
on it let's put some attention on it
let's talk about it
right let's not judge each other
let's stay out of the judging business
let's just treat it as a health problem
because it is
and and just go from there gigantic
gigantic opportunity with no
disagreement
if you do it right
you would always get the the people who
are advocates for you know people who
are larger
and they you know they don't want to be
mocked for their i guess lifestyle
choice in some cases
and that's fine but it's really not
about them
nobody's saying you have to do anything
it's not you know there wouldn't be
mandatory gym
you know i'm talking about helping
people
not forcing people right the government
could certainly help people
it doesn't have to force anybody to do
anything
yes so if you have a uh
low low t and uh you've got
sexual dysfunction that can't be helping
the population it just can't be although
i suspect these days
having a kid is more choice than
not
um
sean penn got in trouble
for saying that uh men in america are
becoming quote quite feminized
um
and uh
he said
quote uh there are a lot of i think
cowardly genes that lead to people
surrendering their
their jeans meaning the jeans that
they're wearing
and putting on a skirt now he's talking
about some famous celebrities i guess
more than the public
but uh what do you think about that
do you think that's a old man that yells
at the clouds
ah these kids today
back in my day
men wore pants
or is he on to something
because remember
sean is not right wing
by any stretch of the imagination
but he's saying something that you would
more associate with somebody who was on
the right the political right
yeah can can we at least come together
on that
now i unlike many in my audience right
now
i am very supportive of anybody who
doesn't want to be like the mainstream
in any social way whatsoever so lgbtq
love you
just just be whatever makes you happy
you know if if society can't allow you
to do that then society sucks you should
let people you know live whatever life
they want to live so i'm i'm in favor of
the freedom
uh
for people to be who they are that said
let me ask a question just for the women
can i
if i could i know this is going to be
tough for you guys
because i have more men than women
watching typically
for the men just if you could hold off
for a moment
i want to ask a question just for the
women watching this so women if you
don't normally comment this would be a
good one to jump in
do you think that there is a shortage of
masculine men
now i don't want to use alpha and beta
you you know you could translate that in
your own mind
um
okay on locals i get faster responses
and i'm getting uh
90 yes it looks like
um on youtube i'm seeing
so far only yeses
well okay now this this may be a
reflection of my audience more than a
reflection of of the world
but
at least we agree
[Laughter]
now don't you think that uh literally
the low testosterone
is part of it
i mean it has to be right
that is that am i being anti-science did
i go too far
wouldn't we see exactly what we see with
no other change than lower testosterone
now what causes the lower testosterone
it's not one thing right
some of it is diet
some of it may be getting poor sleep
because of screen time
some of it may be the comparison problem
if you compare yourself to the people on
instagram
what's that do to your testosterone
it doesn't help
right if you're comparing yourself to
the best whatever's in the world instead
of just your neighbor like in the old
days i mean i could only compare myself
to people i knew personally
because you know there were some people
on tv but it wasn't that big a deal
but today you know you're being compared
to the best of the best in the whole
world how does it in theory
if you're being compared to something
that's better than you it should drop
your testosterone is that true
give me a fact check on that
i never know what things i i believe
forever are because you know
you could always find out oh i believed
that forever and that was just
never true
but i think that losing a competition
has at least a temporary drop in
testosterone that's been proven right
uh being embarrassed as opposed to being
victorious
i'm pretty sure you can measure a
difference in testosterone
now imagine you are live in a society
where boys are mostly the winners
let's say 50s 60s 70s and you could
extend that
to wherever your politics want you to
extend it
if you grew up in a world where you just
felt like you were the
you know king of the universe because
you happen to be right you happen to be
the
the right gender at the right time in
history that probably would raise your
testosterone wouldn't it
because you would just walk around
feeling like oh yeah
i'm in charge
now what would happen if instead you
were born in the more current era
and you were told that boys are the
cause of all problems
which
isn't too far off from what's happening
right now right
no i'm not going to say that men don't
cause a lot of problems
oh we do we do our share of crime and
whatnot
but we're also most of the police force
most of the emergency
stuff you know so i mean we contribute
as well
so
some say divorce
some say divorce yeah that might be a
factor i'm not sure it's one factor i
think it's everything from
and i'm gonna say allegedly on this one
so i don't get sued
allegedly our soy intake
have you seen how much the soy is in
every freaking product
like the only thing that doesn't have
soy in it is like a
stalk of broccoli
i swear to god they're going to figure
out how to make soy broccoli
just so you can't get away with it
every packaged food seems to have soy in
it as some kind of filler
or maybe the source of protein or
something i don't know
but why do soy have to be in everything
everything
all right
so i do think that this uh testosterone
thing is real
um
all right now i've got a question just
for the men
just for the men
all right women you have to ride this
one out okay
just for the men
and i'm gonna further uh segment it okay
just for the men watching
who would consider themselves a
masculine compared to the average
i know you're all going to say that's
you right
you're all going to say that you but
just the ones who consider themselves
masculine
have you seen that the demand for what
you're selling is the highest it's ever
been go
just just because you just happened to
be masculine
i believe the answers
you should uh on youtube you should see
the answers on on locals the the
comments go by
uh
the the the quickness of the comments is
based on how many there are
so the
so the faster they answer the faster
they sit by it was just like this wall
of yes
it just went
yes
all right so i'm not imagining it right
i'm not imagining it
[Laughter]
all right here's my next question
and maybe my last for today
um
do you remember black lives matter and
do you remember antifa and do you
remember
occupy wall street
and one thing they all had in common is
that they were really really big and
then they just sort of went away
were any of them natural
were they all scams
they were just funded by somebody right
i think they were all scams
based on today's look backwards just the
fact that they
made such a big impact and then went
away just as suddenly
that does suggest that it was never real
now what's going to happen when the next
one pops up
are you going to do
are you going to have a gel man
amnesia do you know what that would be
so galban amnesia i won't give you the
whole background of what that means what
it means is
when there's another totally
group
that starts protesting are you going to
say oh this one's real
are you gonna believe the next
 group
after after three in a row that are
obviously in my
just my opinion
in my opinion they're obviously
and i thought they were at the
time i wasn't really following occupy
wall street but i didn't really
understand that one
i mean when it was happening i kept
looking at it thinking
well that's kind of weird that this
suddenly pops up
when nothing is much that different
but now i would say it's somewhat clear
that these were scams of some sort now
when i say there were scams i don't mean
that the people who are individually
protesting were insincere
i do think that most of the people on
the street were sincere in whatever that
means for antifa i'm not sure what it
means to be a sincere antifa person
but i'm talking about the leadership of
the funding and the organization though
that apparently that was all a scam
now here's some news from the
washington examiner i think report yeah
the washington examiner
so they were looking into who's in
charge of black lives matter at the
moment
this is just the best story
now i don't know if it's because i'm the
author of the dilbert comic
that i love this story so much
because if you could come up with a more
deliberate scenario than what i'm going
to just describe
now again this is the washington
examiner's reporting
so they were looking into who's in
charge now that the person who was in
charge
the co-founder patrice cullers
so she moved on
and she said that she appointed two of
the activists to serve as the group's
senior directors
so far so good
so we knew who was in charge
she was a co-founder and i guess when
she left she was the last of the
co-founders
and she appointed two activists and we
know their names so good
so the washington examiner went and
talked to the two people who were
appointed and they said we didn't accept
the appointment
what
they said yeah
yeah we were appointed but we didn't
accept the appointment wait what
well
who's got the 60 million dollars
allegedly that that they have
i don't know
what
what like this is one of those stories
that you you can't even read to the end
because you just keep going what
what
now
typically let me give you a warning here
typically a story like this is so on the
nose
it's probably wrong
it's probably not true
right when you see something that's just
too perfectly
stereotypically the worst thing that
could possibly happen
right what would be the most
stereotypically
racist
let's put that out there what would be
the most stereotypically racist thing
you could imagine
would be that you know a a black
organization stole a bunch of money
right that's that the racist brain would
go there immediately
and then the story comes out
that looks
looks
like that's exactly what happened
your first instinct shouldn't be well i
told you so
if your first thing if your first
instinct was i told you so
well you might be a racist
your first instinct should be
could be true
but your first instinct could be should
be that's a little too close
a little too on the nose so just be
warned about this one okay
i don't know that is fact that i'm not
or fiction and i'm not going to predict
either way
so i don't have an opinion whether it's
real or not i'm just saying that
whenever you see one that's this close
to exactly a racist
trope
is that the right word
you got to ask yourself
is it real
you just have to ask yourself
all right
um
but allegedly that's we don't know who's
in charge and money's missing and uh
and the the two remaining blm board
members so there are two board members
who are different from the two directors
who are appointed right so there's still
two board members we know who they are
and
they were asked for a comment
and they
did not return numerous
they did not return numerous requests
for comment
all right i give up
this story might be exactly what it
looks like
it might be
all right so i asked this poll on
twitter
uh i said on twitter today a little poll
i said were antifa blm and occupy wall
street's real movements that suddenly
evaporated or were they always democrat
scams
so when at last i checked 77 said they
were always democrat scams
and uh 23
said that they were actually real
organizations or that they weren't sure
23 percent
23
rounding off 23
25
25
um this will come as no surprise our
 idiots
and it's a very consistent result
now i believe i have delivered on my
claim
that i would show you that every major
topic of any complexity has to branch
into different stories
once you see this you will say to
yourself wait a minute maybe the problem
isn't cognitive dissonance
maybe cognitive dissonance is a
necessity
it's the only way the simulation that
runs our reality can handle the
complexity my story and yours don't have
to match anymore
because i'm in my own subjective reality
and it'll never make any difference if
your story and mine never match
so every future story
even if it doesn't line up perfectly
with democrat and republican
should branch into multiple versions
because it has to
and that ladies and gentlemen
is the reframe of the day
i believe i have delivered on my promise
that this is the best live stream
of all time
bar none
and i will talk to you tomorrow
