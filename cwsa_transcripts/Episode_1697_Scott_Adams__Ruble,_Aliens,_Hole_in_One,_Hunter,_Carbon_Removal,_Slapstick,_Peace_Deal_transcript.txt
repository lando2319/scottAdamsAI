yakking with the people on locals
turned off my computer before i printed
my notes for today
and
what would normally be
the highlight of your life
has now turned into tragically a slow
slog of watching me
try to print while talking at the same
time
not many people can print and talk at
the same time but i'm going to prove
that it's not a myth it can be done
watch and learn
boom
yeah yeah that's printing
yup we're going to take it up a notch
i hope your printers are working as well
as mine because they're
quite quite
good right now
ah
have you ever had this experience
that your printer is so undependable
that when you hear that beautiful sound
of it working correctly like
it's just like music
until i turn around and find out that
the ink is after it's all blank pages
but until i do that
it's going to be awesome
hold on
do you see how many notes are printing
when you hear that much printing it
means a good show a good show is coming
up hold on
oh i can't reach
i'm tied in
you know the thing that sets this show
apart
i'll tell you what sets this show apart
low production values
yeah if you go to other places you're
going to get
a bunch of fancy background sets and
probably the audio will work almost
every time but
do you get this no no
this is casual
this makes you feel comfortable
this is the thing that you want more
than anything but you also want it to
happen in his proper order
because that's the way
you've been taught
good morning everybody
how would you like to participate
in the simultaneous step
i know you would here's the sound
that's what you've been waiting for
and now
now that your day has gone from the
depths
of incompetence to the height
of mastering what we call
the simulation if you'd like to take it
up another notch all you need is a
copper vargarh glass a tanker chelsea
sign a canteen chakra flask a vessel of
any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day
wait
wait hold on hold on i'm going to teach
you something hold on hold on hold on
hold on put you put down your cup
today we're going to take a page out of
george costanza's book we're going to
combine two of the most awesome things
in the world you can do it your own way
we're going to be skill stacking
the simultaneous sip we're not only
going to be sipping your favorite
beverage but at the same time i will be
using this back scratcher to scratch
that itch in the middle of my back that
i've been waiting all day to get watch
this same time you can do it at home too
go
double pleasure
wow
everybody everybody i don't know
yeah if you do the ham sandwich plus the
sex that's what george costanza taught
us in seinfeld you can double your
pleasure
and i think i just did it for you
all right
um now here's what we got going on um
let's see
let's see
apparently uh ukraine is offering some
kind of a uh
land for peace deal
so it looks like
maybe the peace deal ukraine will be
russia keeps you know their
land bridge and they keep the east of
ukraine and maybe maybe the rest of
ukraine stays ukraine who knows
but i saw a
provocative tweet by
somebody named inna sofsan
and maybe a
pro-ukraine person says
for anyone asking me quote maybe you
should give up crimea and donbass in
exchange for peace
before asking this question namely the
specific region in your country you
would be willing to give give up if
putin started bombing your cities
that's a good question
all right if if food were bombing your
country
could you name any part of your country
you'd be willing to give up
well i would start with detroit
but uh that would depend
a lot on putin not googling it
um
but
you know we could just say hey motown
motown and then putin would be a little
that sounds good
so if we could end a war
uh a war that was destroying the country
and the only thing we had to give putin
was detroit
i'd at least talk about it um i'd throw
in san francisco just as a sweetener
i mean he doesn't even have to ask for
that one he'd be like okay we'll stop
the war you just have to give us detroit
and i say wait
are you done negotiating you go yeah
yeah well just detroit that's all we
need we'll stop the war oh
i'd be like
could we offer you more
and you'd be like well you're a bad
negotiator i've just agreed to take
detroit in
return for stopping the war and i'd say
yes but
i was going to offer san francisco
you know if we could just reopen the
negotiations just for a minute
maybe take that off my hands too
delaware another fine suggestion
rhode island
we could give him some of the small
stuff he might not know the difference
all right
here's the most
fascinating thing glenn greenwald is all
over this about how the
cia and the
mainstream media are rewriting history
he's talking about the
the hunter biden laptop story
and you know how
the story came out
that there was provocative stuff on the
laptop about ukraine and business
dealings when
uh when
biden was vice president
and
you know the media just made that story
go away and they made it go away before
the election and it could have made a
big difference could have don't know
so
that was a gigantic story that the media
just made go away
but then as time goes by
it turns out
that uh the story was real
and now we can confirm
that the cia and various intelligence
agencies
colluded to make an important story go
away to rig the election or at least to
influence it i call that rigging but
let's say influence
and then
but then the interesting thing happens
was so the original story goes away but
then when it is validated much later
the story about the story going away
goes away
now here's something you need to
understand about persuasion
persuasion is everything about memory
this is a good way to think of it the
things that you remember are the only
things you act on
that makes sense right
you know when i say it you're like um
well that makes sense if something's not
in your mind in any way
you don't act on it so memories are what
you're trying to create you're trying to
make a stronger memory for the thing you
want to persuade than the memory of
something else so you're going to act on
your strongest memory
and here's a here's a situation
where the cia
with whatever persuasion technology has
working with the mainstream media made a
gigantic story go away
and then
just to show you how much they could
influence your memory
they made the story
about the story going away
go away
and if they can make the story go away
and then they can make
the story about the story going away
going away
then what else can they make go away
and by they i mean
well by they i mean uh
in the story about the uh
what were we just talking about
i forget the topic
was there something about um i think it
was something about
chris rock getting slapped yeah that's
what it was so let's uh talk about that
i feel like there's something i'm
forgetting though
no no i think it was about the oscars
all right do you remember i gave you a
prediction the other day
that was really weird
but you're watching it come true in real
time
faster than i imagined
and the prediction goes like this
the the growth of mushrooms as a
you know a drug of
probably great medical value
some recreational value as well but
honestly the people who take it
recreationally
end up saying that the
the health value is the bigger the
bigger part the mental health part
and i told you that the growth of
mushrooms especially now that has been
commoditized and the stigma has been
removed
that it would change civilization
remember
so this isn't just another drug
in a way you could say fentanyl is
changing civilization but in the worst
possible way
but mushrooms are going to change
civilization probably in a positive way
and one of the ways it does that is it
destroys your ego
and allows you to just consider new
things
so it makes you more creative
so one of the things i predicted is that
the united states
would dominate china in the future
in large part not small part in large
part this is this is what makes the
prediction interesting
not in small part
but one of the biggest reasons the
biggest reasons that the united states
will dominate technology and
entrepreneurship in the future is that
we're going to do more mushrooms
and again i don't recommend this or any
other drug just to be clear
i'm not recommending you take anything
all right yeah every drug has a danger
i'm not a doctor
blah blah blah we're talking about them
we're not recommending
so i'm going to give you an example of
where that wild prediction is already
happening
right in front of you
uh chris rock who's in the news as you
know for getting slapped by will smith
at the oscars do you know that chris
rock is going on a
world tour
comedy tour do you know what the name of
the comedy tour is
somebody say it you know what it is
what what is the comedy tour named it's
already named chris rock's comedy tour
it's called ego death world tour
ego death
world tour
now what is ego death
ego death comes from
using hallucinogens and usually
mushrooms
what are the odds
what are the odds that
there's a big story about mushrooms
and that the person who's in the news
is doing a world tour called ego death
is that a coincidence
now
what else what is the also the biggest
surprise maybe
about chris rock getting slapped
did you hear that he apologized
if you didn't hear that how what's that
doing to your head
chris rock
apologized unreservedly
he's the one who got slapped
he told a joke as a comedian
in the role of a comedian he told a joke
he got slapped hard
and he apologized
unreservedly
who can do that
oh here we go here we go
that's the comment i was looking for
somebody said
yeah wimp right weak
weak
uh stop getting ahead of me
somebody said jesus
so half of you said he's a weak
and some of you said he's like jesus
make up your mind
you know what he is
he is a person who has controlled his
ego
ego death
do you think that he named that world to
her ego death because he hadn't
experienced it
oh no
this is there are no coincidences here
he i'm just guessing right but i'm
putting two and two together and usually
equals four we could be surprised right
because i'm acknowledging that i'm i'm
taking some leaps and assumptions
but if you name your world tour ego
death
you're thinking mushrooms
if you're thinking them you've done them
if you've done them you've experienced
it
he's probably recently experienced ego
death
his response
is response you know the apologizing for
being slapped
is the most aware thing you'll ever see
in your whole life
it's one of the most impressive things
anybody ever did
but it doesn't look that way does it
it looks like to to those of you
operating at a lower level
it looks like he caved he was weak
he gave in
right
those of you operating at a
post
mushroom level
those of you who experienced ego death
might be seeing a different movie
the movie you're seeing is somebody who
took full responsibility for his own
actions
what
that's right
he took full responsibility not partial
not partial
full responsibility
for his own actions
because they're the actions that cause
the other action
now
in the real world does anybody ever do
that almost ever
almost never generally speaking you
would have expected him to hedge and say
well
you know i thought i was just making a
joke
but it was sort of a mistake
nope took full responsibility
now somebody says it was fake
if he did not have a tour called ego
death i might have said so too
scott has jumped the shark the people
you can tell the people who have never
done mushrooms the people who say i've
jumped jumped the shark
that's a good tell for somebody whose
ego
is completely owning them
if you if you want to be totally owned
by your ego just make comments like that
npc
comments all right
so
there's a second part of this that's
even more mushroomy
so while it seems to me that chris rock
is has demonstrated not only by his
immediate reaction but in my opinion and
again this is all very subjective so
there's plenty of room for you to
disagree but in my opinion
chris rock's handling this went from
sort of interesting you know that he
then may be professional i guess they
managed to carry on with the show which
is kind of impressive but when he went
to full responsibility
uh in public and didn't hedge it at all
to me that was very impressive
and here's the thing do you think he
doesn't know
that he'll be called a wimp
of course he does
do you think he doesn't know
that the way he handled it doesn't look
manly
yeah yeah he knows that yup
perfectly aware do you think he's not
aware that he was the smaller man
and a larger man just beat the of
him out of him and on tv
yup
do you think he's handling it
yup
it looks like he can control his ego
here's the better part of this um if you
look on social media it's just full of
people making the same npc comment
which is that will smith is a cuckold
because he allows his wife to date other
men
now
where's the part
where you know what will smith is doing
in his spare time
isn't there something missing in the
story
isn't it more like two people who have
decided to have a
um let's say
an important primary relationship
but they've both decided that they will
have exterior relationships and that
that will be part of their
going forward
now
what makes that bad for will smith
may i may i give you a little bit of
reality
somebody says will smith is gay i don't
think so
i don't think so
here's what i think
would you agree with the following
statement that will smith is probably
probably
one of the most uh desired
you know men in hollywood
that women
would flock to be with them would you
say
can anybody agree with me on that yeah i
mean he would be he's fit he's funny
he's rich he's successful he's got a lot
going for it so i would say that he
could probably
have as much sex as he wanted of the
highest quality
would you agree with that
does anybody disagree with that
that if he wanted
he could have the highest quality and
the most sex he wanted
why do you think he's not doing that
[Laughter]
what in the world
what in the world would make you think
he's not doing that
now yeah i hear the theory that he's gay
but all evidence suggests that's not the
case
right
so
think about will smith's ego
think about this will smith knows
exactly what everybody's saying about
him right
you assume that's true he's completely
aware
that the internet thinks that he's
letting his wife sleep around but he's
not for some reason
where's the part where will smith says
hey hey everybody don't you know that
i'm doing it too
i'm saying
i'm saying a comment on locals that was
let's say off color but very funny
i'll just tell you what it was
there was some
some gentleman on the locals platform
talking about will smith who says uh
i blew him and i can confirm he's gay
probably probably not
probably not it probably didn't happen
anyway
ask yourself this
is will smith operating at a low level
of awareness or a high level of
awareness
at a lower level of awareness what would
you expect him to say
to defend himself against all these
claims
you'd expect him to say
well you know i'm doing it too
it's not just my my wife who's dated
guys
you know i i'm i'm up to my
up to my balls and
strange every day
but because he apparently is operating
at some kind of higher level
apparently
he actually lets this ride
the only thing i've seen as impressive
as this and i've told you this before is
richard gere
who never never denied the rumor which
i'm sure is not true he never denied the
rumor that he once went to the emergency
room where the gerbil stuck up his
butthole
as some sort of alleged sex play now
personally i don't think there's any
chance it's true
but because there was a gigantic rumor
for decades
you'd think at least once
richard gere would say oh that's not
true
but i love the fact he never did that
i love that like it just made me respect
him so much and not respect him because
of the way he handled it necessarily
but respect him because he didn't need
to do it a different way
apparently
like he didn't have any he didn't have
any lower awareness need to defend
himself
he just let her ride
and it looks to me like will smith is
doing the same thing
i mean he's really being viciously
attacked for his lifestyle and
the most obvious thing about his
lifestyle is that he's getting so much
sex that he's probably just exhausted
half the time
so
why did you imagine it was any other way
have you partied with the smiths
no but it sounds like a good time
i can't imagine anything that would be
more fun than that somebody said have i
have i partied with the smiths
uh like literally i can't think of
anything that would be more fun than
that
can you imagine
imagine getting invited to one of their
parties
i'm not i'm not trying to get invited to
a party i'm just like if you imagine it
couldn't be a bad time
it wouldn't be a bad time
all right here's the greatest uh tweet
about uh that
uh
oh and by the way we don't know if chris
and rock knew
about the alopecia or not
uh we're not sure if he knew about that
um but probably i think he's the i think
not right which would explain the whole
thing
all right
here's a tweet that sums it up julius
sharp tweeted this he said last last
night was show business in a nutshell a
performer gets punched in front of
everyone no one does anything to stop it
and everyone acts like it didn't happen
the puncher gets an award and a standing
ovation
and the funniest thing about that is
that that's just a description of what
happened
right
he didn't have to add anything that was
just a description of what happened
all right
um
did you see that trump uh got a hole in
one
so it
if you're not aware of how golf works
there are some holes on the golf course
that are very
long it would take several
you know several strikes with your
instrument to get there
and then there's some that you can reach
the green with you know your driver or
not usually your driver but some you can
reach the green with um
a five iron as trump did
and so if you can reach it in the first
shot there's a chance that it might fall
in that hole
and it looks like
trump is claiming that he did that and
he's got he's got witnesses and one of
them is a professional golfer so sounds
like a pretty good witness but the part
you have to see
and i keep saying this and i don't think
that i think no i think people are
starting to understand
trump is a really good writer
does everybody get that
that whatever you want to say about him
in any other realm
he's a really good writer
every sentence he writes you can't you
can't look away
you know and
somebody says steinbeck
if something about the visual imagery is
something about the fact he never says
what you expect him to say
there's something about the complexity
of it there's something about the humor
in all of it like everything is
tongue-in-cheek but you're not you're
not quite sure
and and also that the joke is on the
reader
and you know that you you know that
trump is making some people upset to
entertain other people
and it's working
so i'm not going to read the statement
but i will
i will simply turn you toward it and say
if you get a chance to google
trump hole-in-one and read his statement
about it it's just a little masterpiece
it just is it's just a little
masterpiece
all right
what else is happening well the wall
street journal has a big article and
it's uh
proving once again that the adam's law
of slow-moving disasters
is a darn
good one
um
so the adam's law of slow moving
disaster says if he can see a disaster
coming
with enough time to do something we
always adjust
because there have been plenty of
world ending disasters
we're all going to run out of food well
okay we didn't we're gonna run out of
oil
okay we didn't
right so climate change is gonna kill us
all it probably won't
so here's what's happening in climate
change not only are there
let's see i think it was maybe a year
and a half ago when i was doing research
on this there were about a half a dozen
companies in the
carbon removal business where they could
suck the carbon right out of the air or
right out of the smokestack
and uh turn it into a product or store
it in rocks
basically get it out of the system
and
uh that handful of companies a year and
a half ago
has now turned into
um
there were 200 companies that asked
shopify
for some investment in that space and
i guess nine of them they funded so one
company
just shopify
got 200 applications in this space and
funded nine of them
so there's just immense
immense energy just went into carbon
capture
because anybody who gets something that
works is going to be a multi-billionaire
right
there aren't that many
areas left
where there's a virgin field you know
it's just a field and somebody's going
to be a billionaire and everybody wants
to be that billionaire somebody's going
to make the better carbon capture and
the article in the wall street journal
today goes through a number of ways
they're doing it one of them is
a company that uses drones
just to drop seeds in places that need
to be reforested
now there probably were other ways to
drop seeds like walking around and
tossing them
that always works
but
uh you can see that the you know the
breadth of the number of companies
working in the space is pretty big so
here's what i think
i think we're going to be fine
i think we're going to be fine
climate change wise i think that the
the the problems we have are that all
predictions are straight line
predictions
when you make a prediction about what's
going to happen in 80 years
it's
almost always what i'll call a straight
line prediction and if i may use my
back scratcher to illustrate it
it means that whatever you're predicting
let's say
the rate of growth in something
tends to just go in a predictable line
you know like it's one straight line now
you might say that the growth of it is
quick or the growth of it is slow but
still when you predict it you never you
never predict big bumps and shocks
because those are by definition
unpredictable so instead you put it in a
straight line but the real world never
works like that
so why do i say that nobody can do a
long-range prediction about anything
because in 100 of cases
there are surprises if you wait long
enough so the longer the time period the
less you can predict obviously
now
this carbon capture stuff is already
taking a steep turn
so if you looked at if you predicted
carbon capture you would say well it's
not very good now but if it slowly
improves you know maybe it'll make a
little difference in 80 years
which would be ridiculous now i don't
know that they're making that specific
assumption i'm making a general case
about assumptions
but if you look at this wall street
journal article 200 companies sprung up
in this space
it looks like carbon capture is going to
go from doesn't work doesn't work
doesn't work
a thousand companies are working on it
oh somebody got it
i think that's what's gonna happen i
think numbers alone
and all this energy put into the same
field pretty much guarantees that one of
them is going to
become apple computer
pretty much
would anybody disagree with that that if
you have enough energy going into a
question even fusion looks like it's
going to be solved
even fusion
about flying cars
yeah we're one year away from flying
cars not i mean
not literally a car even though we will
have some of those but but a little
quadracopter
that you can just have in your backyard
and fly places
that's like a year away i think you can
actually put in an order for one right
now
so pretty much everything happens if you
put enough energy into it enough
companies try enough things
let's talk about the ruble there was
something i never understood
about
currency
which is
if you can make somebody pay you in a
certain currency and they need whatever
you're selling that currency always has
value doesn't it
i didn't understand how a currency could
like decline in value so long as there
was um
uh all right
i was reading a paid comment there but
so
anyway
uh are we talking about hunter's laptop
sorry that got me totally distracted
there oh talk about uh currency in the
ruble so i guess what russia is doing is
uh they're saying if you want to buy our
energy
which apparently people have to or don't
they'll die
you have to pay us in rubles
which makes the ruble not collapse
because you have to turn your money into
a ruble to buy some energy and you have
to buy energy
so
why did we not see it coming that the
ruble would just
become the currency that you have to buy
russian products with and
ruble is mispronounced
it's a rubble
yeah what are the what are the odds that
uh they would turn uh ukraine into
rubble
and ukraine would turn their currency
into uh their ruble into rubble
a lot of rubble
anyway
uh so it looks like there's peace talks
and
uh looks like the where things are
headed with ukraine and russia
is that uh
russia has already drastically reduced
its military around cave keeve
so it looks like russia is not as
interested or unless they're bluffing
they're not as interested in taking the
capital because it looks like they want
to consolidate what they've already
taken
and call it a victory
and
if they do that would you say that putin
won
if putin gets the don bass and that
other region
and they get a land bridge and they get
no nato in ukraine
and they get no offensive weapons in
ukraine and neutrality
would you say that putin won
despite the sanctions
yeah
yeah i'd have to say yes
because you know what
it's only going to take about five years
of
putin acting not as belligerent i'm
assuming he could pull that off
five years without a war it's only gonna
take him five years without war and the
sanctions will fall apart and
and he will have won
to me it looks like he won
would anybody disagree
because i'm seeing
opinions i saw ian bremmer
say that no matter what happens putin
lost
it doesn't look like it to me to me it
looks like you won
am i right
it looks like ukraine lost a bunch of
stuff
and it looks like you won and moreover
it looks like putin will bring peace
to those places he took over
am i wrong about that
could you say that it's more likely
there will be peace in the don bass if
putin just controls the whole thing i
think so
because there was it was dangerous there
before putin right
did scott say ukraine would win
well
it looks
i i guess i was specifically thinking
about
a key falling or ukraine falling as a
country
would you say that zielenski won
let's say things go the way it looks
like they're going to go
some kind of russia keeps part of it and
and zielenski keeps part
wouldn't you say that ukraine um
i don't know if you'd say they won
it looks like they both got
something
because i think ukraine will be safer
now
somebody smart said the following it's
going to be tough for russia to get out
of the sanctions but it might be easy
for ukraine to rebuild
do you know is the very best thing you
could do for a european country
there's probably nothing better you
could do for it
which starts with something awful
the awful part is being bombed into
rubble
and millions of people leaving and
starvation and every other deprivation
so it's horrible
but in theory because ukraine is an
educated population you'll have a lot of
support probably get a lot of western
funding
ukraine will probably rebuild into the
coolest place around
am i right because if you can rebuild
and you build everything modern and it's
just better
i feel like
somebody says you're wrong
i feel like in the long run
although the you know nobody would have
chosen the war
uh yeah both sides win
and scott predicted it somebody says
i don't know that i predicted both sides
would win but it certainly looks like
putin will claim he won and it looks
like ukraine did not fall
now
how many people
predicted that great ukraine would not
fall
apparently scott has yet to inform
himself i'm reading a paid comment about
operation gladio the singular thing that
explains literally all of the united
states foreign policy
well um
i will get back to you on that
uh i predicted that both would claim
victory well i don't think both would
claim victory if kiev had fell
had fallen right
if the capital had
gone under a russian control
i feel as though
ukraine could not claim any victory and
as it is i'm not sure it's a victory
it's a it's a not losing as bad as they
could have i guess
rebuild without a strong dollar yeah
that might
that might make a difference
i said you predicted it was possible
ukraine could win outright
i don't know
i mean it looks like they won
outright because the
the regions that russia will control are
largely disputed regions right
a disputed region isn't exactly
ukraine's to begin with it's a disputed
region
so i'm not sure the ukraine lost ukraine
i think that the disputed regions became
less disputed if that's what happens
so somebody says this is weasel thinking
no it's weasel talking
so
yes i do believe i could make a weasel
argument for having been the most
accurate predictor
i do i believe i could make that weasel
argument but you know every every other
predictor is going to say they were
right just like every other time
everybody who made a prediction is going
to say they were right
that's what happened with the pandemic
the people who predicted that there was
no pandemic at all
are saying they were right
and the people who said that will kill a
million people
are saying they're right
so everybody gets to be right all the
time
it used to be you got to be wrong
now you don't
anything else happening
biden wants to tax the rich in the
dumbest idea i've ever seen
which couldn't possibly be the product
of a stable mind
he wants to attach he wants to tax the
rich
on
appreciation of their stock assets in
any one year
with no word as to whether they could
get it right off
if it went down the next year
there isn't the slightest chance that
this could get passed it's almost like
it's a joke proposal
hey i got an idea
every time you put on mismatching socks
if your net wealth is over a million
dollars you're gonna pay a seven percent
surtax and people would say
i don't know but that's the dumbest idea
i've ever heard
it just
it almost sounds random it's so bad
it doesn't even sound like a real idea
it sounds like a movie idea is so bad
he will get exactly
well i guess there'll always be some
democrat economists will say it will
work
but i don't think i've heard one yet
here's my challenge to you
see if you can find even a democrat
economist a professional economist a
democrat
who thinks it's a good idea
to tax stock appreciation before you
actually sell it and realize the gain
now i don't think krugman would
i'll bet not somebody says that krugman
would because you imagine he's uh you
know in the pocket
of the left i'll bet you can't get any
any
erysha is not an economist i i think
um
janna yellen did
no
no i don't believe that
i do not believe any professional
economist a democrat or not has ever
addressed that well bernie's not an
economist
right so that's my challenge see if you
see if you can get a democrat
economist to agree with the democrat
plan i don't think so
i don't think so
all right
um the hunter biden
connection to the
ukrainian labs is mostly fake news
are you all aware of that
so i joked but i didn't really talk
about it too much i joked that it was
the the simulation had to give us
hunter biden connected to
bio labs in ukraine because it's just
the funniest thing that could happen
and sure enough it happened
but it turns out that that's closer to
fake news than real news
um
wow
and
so here's why it's fake news the the
connection is real but it's so indirect
that it's ridiculous
so
um
no i i read about the emails as well
so the the apparently these labs were
not weapons labs or they weren't
bioweapons labs they were biological
research facilities but of course you
could argue that one could be turned
into the other
but there's no evidence that they were
meant
to be bioweapons
and his investment was through a fund
and a fund had some money in something
you probably never knew blah blah so his
connection to them is
is there
but it's through money that went through
other hands and
basically it's not really a story
it's fun it's fun but it's not really a
story
how can you be so obtuse
greg says
greg
do you really believe
do you really believe really
that hunter would be funding bioweapons
labs in ukraine and that that's like the
secret story
really
really or do you think it's a little
more likely
that he had money in funds they had
money in lots of different places
because that would be normal
it's normal to have money in funds that
have money and lots of places you don't
know about
it is not normal
that he would be
directly investing in
bio-weapon labs in another country
that wouldn't be likely
all right so i'm so i'm going to say
that the labs exist they're not
they're not designed as bio-weapons labs
and that there is money that flowed and
100 had something to do with it but i
don't think it's a story story it
doesn't seem to have any
i don't know doesn't seem to have any
relevance let's say doesn't seem to be
relevant
all right um
biden's dementia is getting worse and i
wonder who is behind this tweet
so biden tweeted that russia's economy
was ranked the 11th biggest economy in
the world before this invasion
uh
but that now
uh soon will not even rank in the top 20
in the world
what do you think about that won't rank
in the top 20.
so
is that the most up thing you've
ever seen your president do
that's just up here's why
aren't we mad at putin
we're not really mad at the russian
citizens are we
when did that happen
was that some kind of shift
because he's actually doing a victory
dance on the suffering of the
russian citizens
not cool
that's not cool
now i i understand what he's getting at
right he's showing that these sanctions
work and the the russian public should
rise up and get rid of putin but they're
not gonna
so it just seems messed up to me
now i'm in favor of the sanctions
i'm in favor of the sanctions
but
doing a little victory dance like this
on top of the citizens of russia
just feels low class
it doesn't feel strategic
it doesn't feel good for the united
states
it just feels a little dementia-like
so who approves this
i mean
let's face it we know biden doesn't do
his own tweeting right he's not there
i'll tweet this
so somebody approved it i mean some
adviser
that's scary
um
so that's happening
and here's the worst argument about
ukraine that's a violation of
international law
uh i've heard it said
who said it maybe
maybe on the five i heard it that uh we
should simplify the case and just say
it's a
it's a violation of international law
and just
stick it to that was it was it greg
or was it jesse
somebody said it
and i would disagree with that because
violation of international law is
meaningless to everybody
everybody violates international law
when they can get away with it it's
really just about what you can get away
with
so saying it's a violation of
international law it doesn't really buy
you much for persuasion
um for persuasion i'd say
we can't let anybody be rewarded for
conquering their neighbor
is that better
we can't let putin be rewarded for
conquering his neighbor now remember
it was sort of a optional war
i mean maybe russia would argue but
uh it was kind of an optional war
if you if you
run an optional war to conquer your
neighbor you just can't be rewarded for
that you just have to make sure that's
not rewarded so i would say that that's
a better way to
simplify
because nobody respects international
law
if they can get away with breaking it
for their own self-interest
what do you what do you think about the
question now uh would putin would putin
have invaded under trump
what do you think
do you think if trump had been president
putin would have invaded
now i know this audience is going to say
no because he was unpredictable
and maybe not
but here's let me give you the counter
argument
because i've made i made the argument
myself that maybe putin wouldn't here's
the counter argument
nothing was going to stop him
he was going to do it no matter what
because it does look like putin's kind
of determined if you know what i mean
it may have looked different
but i think you would have done it
anyway
and the the idea is that he doesn't seem
to be scared of risk
[Music]
right
putin seems very
risk-taking
i feel like he i feel like he just would
have said you know the don bass is
whatever and we're just gonna
we've got to do what we got to do
so
he did wait
we heard but i don't think that's
confirmed
and if he had waited let's let's say
let's say trump had won a second term
do you think he would have waited a
whole other four years
it made sense for him to wait
to see if biden got elected
and i think that's why you're conflating
it would definitely make sense to see if
putin got if biden got elected but maybe
he just would have done it differently
if trump got elected i don't i don't
think we can conclude we know what would
have happened
all right
i saw the most interesting uh
tweet today so it was a cernovich tweet
but it was about a piece a medium piece
um
where somebody jonathan roseland was
writing about
he was reading graham hancock's magician
of the gods book
and i was talking about all these
great pyramids and
ancient constructions
that
we barely know how to do today if at all
now have you ever
have you ever wondered why it is that
they knew how to make pyramids at one
point and then they stopped knowing how
to make pyramids
isn't that weird
like why did
why did the egyptians just sort of stop
doing it and when they stopped doing it
why didn't they at least uh
you know carve into a wall or something
the instructions for making another one
um
so here's a further mystery to that and
that comes from that graham hancock book
i guess
that
for everything else in history you can
see the early prototypes
if a if let's say an alien civilization
came here and tried to figure out what
humans were like before we became
extinct
they would find early automobiles they'd
find bicycles
and then they'd see the evolution from
the early early automobiles to the
modern ones then to airplanes and
rockets and you could kind of see
you know the whole progression of
technology
right
if you could find enough you know
remaining stuff
but why is it that when you look at and
this is this is what i guess graham
hancock asks why is that then we look at
these great um structures and
pyramid-like structures all over the
world and remember it wasn't just in
egypt
all over the world there were these
pockets where they built great things
and then here's the key part
they forgot how to do it
and here's the new part
there were no prototypes
nobody found the bad the bad uh pyramid
where was the bad one
where was the early one where was the
practice pyramid
none of these things had any practice
apparently now i think that's probably
not true probably there was practice and
we just didn't find them or they
maybe they took the stones from the
practice one and put it in the good one
it's like i'll just tear down this
pyramid and make a better one using
those stones i don't know maybe
something like that
but so i'm not so sure that we don't
know where the prototypes are but i love
the question
and the hypothesis is this
that there was a time that something
like atlantis might have existed
and that there must have been some
advanced civilization
that was helping all these other
civilizations
build massive structures
and the speculation is it would um
it would sort of inspire the locals
to
know what they could do and and build
more technology so there might have been
a way to seed the primitives
with technology
what do you think
was it a way to
seed the primitives with technology by
saying look we're going to help you
build this pyramid
once you see how this is done
it's like everything you need like
you'll see that things can be done and
then you'll try to do them yourself and
that will that will raise you up the
evolutionary
ladder faster
because you'll know that
technology is something that can be
developed and
coordinated and stuff i don't know
it's a little bit of a stretch
but i kind of love it
i'll tell you that when i was in greece
and there's a
a place off of
santorini
so on santorini
there is a
an advanced civilization which they've
uncovered and you can go visit it
in which they actually had like indoor
plumbing
and you know however many thousands of
years ago
now when i say indoor plumbing i just
mean that there was a you know a channel
from the upstairs throne all the way
down to the sewer system
and so
uh their streets and their
water capture and even maybe their war
technology even their sailing seems to
have been quite advanced now something
wiped it down
so it might have been minoan
civilization or something but apparently
they had seafaring vessels that probably
were doing trade with africa
and
there were advanced civilizations they
got wiped out
now we don't know if that was atlantis
but some people say it is some people
say it isn't
yeah maybe there were a bunch of
advanced civilizations
maybe there were a bunch here's the
theory that i like the best
a
a an advanced civilization of aliens
came to earth and goosed our evolution
for whatever reason maybe to prepare it
for their own
their own inhabitation later in a
million years when their planet dies
i mean think of it this way
what would we do
if we knew earth was going to die
guaranteed
in a million years what would we do
we'd make a new planet but instead of
making a new one wouldn't it be smarter
to terraform an existing one
yeah so you'd go there and you'd put
some dna there and you'd
you'd build it into a world of food
so that when you decided to leave your
dying planet and go to this new planet
it'd be full of food
plants and animals and well uh oh people
but maybe the people
were goosed in their evolution
by
because you needed the people to
civilize the planet so when the aliens
come
many of the problems have been solved
and then they just eat the people and
take over the technology
something like that
well that's one possibility
the other possibility is
nothing like that
but i do wonder where are the prototype
pyramids
um
aliens with that power don't need to
seed planets
oh i don't know i don't know
they don't need to
but let me let me put it this way how
many of you are like growing vegetables
in your backyard
you don't need to
you don't need to so an advanced alien
civilization wouldn't necessarily do
things because it needed to
it would just do things they could
because it wants to
you just described my book
okay
um
maybe they weren't angels
um maybe they made patterns with
cardboard okay that could could be it
uh looking west to egypt for the
prototypes
don't become art bell
well the difference uh
the difference between art bell and me
is i'm not trying to tell you it's true
well actually i don't know if he does
that either maybe nobody does that
all right that's all for now um i'm
going to say
goodbye to you on youtube and i'll talk
to you tomorrow
