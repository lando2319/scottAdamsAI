hey everybody
come on in i'm sorry if you saw my
aborted attempt
to do uh live stream just a minute ago
i was trying to take my selfie profile
image
that appears as the as the thumbnail and
i hit the wrong button
because this interface could use a
little help
but how great is today
i'm gonna teach you about reality tell
you what the fake news is trying to fool
you with
and we're going to have some fun oh yeah
and all you need is a copper margaret
glass a
tanker chelsea stein a canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now
go
i saw a question go by that i want to
answer
it feels weird
i'm just reading uh who is this one of
the commenters saying that
they're addicted to the simultaneous sip
and now they feel weird if
if they think i'm not gonna be here to
do it well that's exactly how i got you
gets you addicted it's not an accident
there are no accidents bill bolte
good to see you and we have lots of
stuff to talk about let's jump right in
all right
number one uh elon musk
one of his test rockets exploded after
it
returned otherwise safely back to the
launch pad
have you watched one of these uh spacex
or rockets
land after it's done its thing and it's
the wildest thing to hear to see it land
upright it just seems like
isn't there some way to do this easier
than trying to make it land
upright but maybe not i'm sure they
thought about it all
so it did land okay but a few minutes
after it landed it exploded there was
some
some kind of leak or something maybe and
i was trying to think
how how hard that must be
if you were on the team and you thought
it worked
and it went up and it came back and i
guess previous ones have
exploded and this one landed and you're
like yay
what and it just blew up
i'll tell you elon musk
has a pair of gonads about the
size of jupiter i believe our largest
planet
and i love the fact
that he's gonna he's just gonna blow up
rockets until this works
i don't know if the i don't know if nasa
could do this
could nasa fail as many times as you
necessarily will need to
to get to success i don't know if they
could i feel as if
his elon musk's sort of special place
in the country gets more and more
special
every time he pushes through something
like this and you know he's going to
push through it right
they're going to learn something do it
again just keep doing it again
until it works so i love living in a
country
where elon musk can put up a rocket
and it can blow up doesn't even slow him
down
don't you like that i mean you know
nobody wants the rocket to blow up
nobody was hurt
but uh there's something awesome about
it blowing up
and having no impact no impact
on the fact that he'll keep going
tiger tiger woods is talking about his
crash and apparently says
he doesn't remember driving which is
interesting
because he was lucid when he was found
but he doesn't say
i don't remember the crash he says i
don't remember driving
is that ambien what is that
it does feel as though there was uh some
loss of consciousness
so my guess i'm just speculating but
based on how
where the car the automobile went after
he lost control
it looks like he was unconscious so
i guess we'll find out may or maybe
we'll never find out
the effort to recall gavin newsom in
california needed 1.5 million signatures
but they always get extra in case some
are thrown out they're up to 1.9
they have 1.9 million people signed a
recall
petition for the governor does anybody
have any idea who would replace him
because i think if you do the recall he
can still run right
is that how it works even though he's
recalled he can still run
because nothing prevents that so he's
have to win again right
so who in who in uh
california is even the right candidate
i don't even know somebody's saying rick
grinnell
i don't know if he wants to run for
state office though
i could see him running for president
someday rick grinnell
how would you like to see rick grinnell
run for president
let me just give let's just see what it
looks like here in the comments
because i don't know how he would lose
do you how could he lose how could rick
grinnell
lose if he ran for president as a
republican
i don't think he could i feel like he's
got the
the demographic little advantage there
the people who are gonna
sort of be semi-automatic voters
and then you just get all the
republicans and then you're done
i don't know how he could lose honestly
now you may have you know maybe somebody
digs up some scandal or something we
don't know about
everybody's got one of those but he
seems pretty solid
seems pretty solid we'll see
chris harrison host of the bachelor
uh he's actually going to come back for
a while it looked like he was going to
step back from the job because he said
some
inaugural things about one of the
contestants who had
some years ago been at a uh what do they
call it a uh
uh like a party celebrating the old
south
antebellum party and that was considered
racist because it was celebrating a
you know a system that included racism
as a like a prime
foundation of the system and here's i
want to read you harrison's
actual uh words apology okay
and i wanted i want you to see if he
says something
racist in the apology
see if you can find it all right so he's
trying to avoid being called
racist or insensitive i guess and he's
going to make a statement see if you can
find the racist statement
that's in the apology all right here it
goes
chris harrison says quote i am saddened
and shocked at how insensitive i was
in that interview with rachel lindsay
and i didn't speak from my heart
and that is to say i stand against all
forms of racism
and i'm deeply sorry i'm sorry to rachel
lindsay i'm sorry to the black community
harrison added did he catch it
did you catch the racist statement
within the apology
let's see if anybody sucked right
you got it somebody got it right away
all forms if you if you say that you're
opposed to
all forms of racism what have you said
it says you're opposed to racism
including
against against white people and against
adult white males because it's all forms
right
i don't know if you can include that
anymore can you
because it feels like when he threw in
the all forms
didn't you feel a little bit of a
republican vibe to that
just that just a whiff of maybe a little
concern
i don't know that he would be republican
or i'm not saying
i'm not saying he would um categorize
himself that way i have no idea so i'm
not
speculating on that i'm just saying that
choice of words is just
just a whiff there's just a whiff of a
hint
with that phraseology
now i don't know if you can tell that
i'm not calling it racist
you didn't think i was calling it racist
right i'm saying that there's
there's just a choice of words there
that shows a little bit of independence
just there's just a little bit of revolt
that's embedded in an embarrassing
apology
it's embarrassing because it's over the
top
you know i'm a horrible person i can't
believe what i did
it's the end of the world because i used
an inartful
phrase what was i thinking it's all
ridiculously over the top
and then after he's gone ridiculously
over the top where you're thinking to
yourself legitimately i asked this
like no joke the first time i saw his
apology i said
i can't tell if he's kidding because he
did it
so on point that it looked like sarcasm
like almost right
and then he comes out with this with
this little all forms of
of racism and i think did he do it again
i feel like chris harrison just sent us
two secret messages
uh i'm reading a book you may have heard
of it's called 1984.
and people said hey you should read this
book 1984
because it has historical significance
and somehow my incredible education in
windham new york did not include that
book it's amazing
but i never read it before so i just
started digging in
and one of the major themes is that the
people are so
observed you know they've got a a
monitoring screen in their house that
listens to them and watches them
and they don't even want to make a wrong
facial expression
unless they turn away from the screen
that's in their home watching them all
the time and they don't even want to
make like eye contact with somebody else
if even the eye contact could be
interpreted as maybe
maybe some kind of the beginning of a
rebellion it's like hey
if you looked at that person across
there and they looked at you in a
knowing way
maybe that's the beginning of a
rebellion and you better watch how your
eyes
work so in 1984 things are so restricted
and you'll be effectively canceled i
guess if you
if you deviate even a little bit
that the main character is wondering if
some other character
is sending him a secret message just
because of the way he looked at him once
just once
just gave him a look like oh i'm on your
side but he wasn't sure if that's what
the look said
all he had was the look and it was the
only thing he had to cling to
to feel any hope any hope
basically or any feeling of humanity
was just a little glance from another
person
that may or may not have said i feel you
you know we're all trapped here and
here's
chris harrison by the way i'm making
this is all just speculation for fun
right
nobody knows what chris harrison is
thinking so don't
don't take anything i say about what
he's thinking
as any kind of a credible statement i'm
just saying
if you read the book and then you watch
this
it feels very similar it just feels like
chris harrison sent us a message
but it was a really subtle one by over
apologizing you saw it right how many of
you got that message
when you saw his apology did you say to
yourself
huh anybody you know before i told you
that it looks suspicious
how many of you saw and the first thing
you thought was i'm not sure
just look at the comments see if anybody
else picked up on it
um it's like a wink somebody says yes
they're more nose than yes somebody says
i heard a dog whistle
no nope yeah so i'm probably imagining
it right
maybe so but that is the world that we
have entered
in which uh any thought that you would
say your
actual opinions pretty dangerous
pretty dangerous um
the latest uh presumed fake news and i'm
gonna use that word
presumed because i think you have to
presume some kind of stories of fake
news
from the start right if you hear a story
that says
an anonymous source says that trump was
eating a baby a live baby what would be
the presumption the presumption would be
that's fake news
right just on the surface here's another
one
quote we've obtained intelligence that
shows a possible plot
this is a government statement to breach
the capital by an
unidentified identified not unidentified
by an identified militia group on
thursday march 4th
uh the uscp said in a statement
um so what do you think of that
do you think that there's a a possible
plot
to breach the capital by identified
militia groups
that's being reported so
it's probably true right because it
comes from our
intelligence organizations and if you
can't trust our intelligence
organizations
who can you trust am i right
so the intelligence organizations the
same people who told us there was an
armed insurrection
or at least associated with the same
people who told us there was an armed
interaction
as byron york points out in the
washington examiner
bray hume tweeted this tweeted byron's
article
and byron york points out something that
i kind of think maybe i sort of almost
knew but i didn't
which is during the quote armed
insurrection
and byron shows how armed insurrection
those exact words are used by the media
number times
so they called it an armed insurrection
and there were also
lots of people who arrested right
so those are the two things we know the
media called it an armed insurrection
and they arrested a lot of people how
many
guns did they take from the people they
arrested
give me a number what do you think the
total number of guns
that were uh taken from all the people
arrested the hundreds now right
is it dozens or hundreds were arrested
zero zero they did have stuff like bear
spray
and clubs and stuff like that and those
they'll kill you too
apparently but zero
if they had taken one gun
i would be sensitive to at least if they
said armed armed insurrection
at least it's sort of technically almost
true
somebody's saying one but that was taken
from a car it wasn't taken from a person
taken from a car from some you know
somebody owned it of course
um think about that think about the
fake news selling you on an armed
insurrection
and nobody who got arrested had a gun
now there were people with
concealed carry and unconcealed carry i
think
i'm not sure but we know weapons were
there
there is a complete non-overlap between
the people who had weapons
and the people who are willing to break
the law at this at that
time right nobody with a weapon broke a
law and got caught
not one person who had a weapon on them
also broke some different law and got
caught
that's a little bit hard to sell as an
armed insurrection
but now we're being told there's another
one
armed insurrection version too and it's
an
identified um militia group
what's their name what's the name of the
identified
militia group um let me read further in
the story
i don't see it did you have you seen the
name
of the identified identified
militia group they're not going to tell
us the name
if this were al-qaeda would they say
well we we have a terror group
that's all you need to know somebody
says it's classified
should it be maybe it is should it be
because i don't believe any of this
story
because this story depends on the fact
that somebody watched
the capital assault on january whatever
and that they said to themselves i think
this could work out if we
we take another run at it
what would that look like how big is
this militia
is this a militia with let's say
oh i don't know i'll pick a number 80
people who are associated with it
which would be a lot 80 people who
maybe 15 of them could get a plane
ticket to washington dc on this date
and then they were going to do what
were they going to conquer the capital
and hold territory with their 15 people
and then use that as the beginning of
running the country
what could could the news that's
making up the story this is obviously a
 story
could they at least give us some kind of
a make up some more details
like what they plan to do is bring x
number of people
and they plan to hold the government or
is it the beginning of what they hope
will be
a general uprising once they get things
going
because they watched the first capital
assault and you'd have to think that
they thought well that works so well
let's do some more of that what exactly
was the plan here
for these 15 guys i'm just making up a
number
15 guys who could get to dc were they
going to take on the
military of the united states
if you can't even come up with a fake
news story
that even holds together with its own
fake news facts
don't put it in the news don't even tell
us about it
if you can't even make the fake news fit
like that like it doesn't even make any
sense
these guys really what they're gonna uh
anyway
so that's the world we live in all right
uh uh don't expect to see any militia
uprise in dc
um president biden did something
i don't know that he's done anything
like this in a long long time
it was quite unprecedented he said
something interesting
i know i didn't see it coming either so
apparently uh
biden was talking about the governors of
of uh texas and mississippi who dropped
all the
restrictions for coronavirus masks and
lockdowns and stuff
and biden said
the last thing we need is the
neanderthal thinking
so he's basically calling the republican
governors
those two states neanderthals
to which i say thank you
thank you joe biden for being
interesting for once
i mean i do this live stream every day
you're giving me nothing
nothing i need a little more
dare i say trumpiness
what did i tell you what happened to joe
biden eventually and
really there's no way to be avoided that
inexorably there's a word you shouldn't
say until you practice it and you're
from the mirror inexorably inextricably
you know the word
i'll just do a joe biden you know the
word you know the word
the thing the thing but he's finally
insulting uh
insulting people with insulting names
like neanderthal
and i as an observer of politics
appreciate this
thank you for being more like
donald trump because trump was
interesting
no matter what else you said about him
he always entertained
now biden taking a little little baby
step into being more interesting
calling the governor's neanderthals i
approve
i'm not saying i agree with his opinion
i'm saying i approve of his insulting
his insulting ways
well in other news the democrats
this is according to steve scalise he
said the democrats just voted to ban
voter id nationwide and force every
state to permanently expand
mail-in voting now
how many of you know the argument pro
and con
all about none of you
or close to none of you how many of you
could articulate the
the argument on either side on either
side
because i don't feel like we are ever
told the argument it feels like they
just report what the bill is
and then just say what happened but
what's the argument what would be the
argument for
not requiring id well
according to daniel dale who tried to do
a
fact check on the claims made about this
latest
legislative thing um
and he really has to try hard yeah you
have to listen to these daniel dale fact
checks on this
so he's not fact-checking steve scalise
he's just fact-checking
people saying things about the bill he
says
well first he's talking about mike
pence's talking about the
topic and he says that pence claimed
that under the bill
voter id would be banned from coast to
coast
so is that true or false that voter id
would be banned i feel like that's what
was reported
right wasn't that exactly the point so i
feel like
mike pence just described exactly what
the news told us
that the bill would ban requirement of
voter id
but daniel dale says that's a false
statement it's false
and here's why he says facts first this
is false
the bill does not prohibit states from
having voter identification
requirements oh well that's different
right
but read on rather it requires states to
allow voters who do not
show id to instead submit a signed
statement under penalty of perjury
attesting to their identity
and eligibility to vote oh oh
that kind of id the kind of id
where you promise it's really you
why didn't you tell me why do we need
why do we need driver's licenses can't
we get rid of the dmv
and then if a cop stops you and he says
do you have a license and i say of
course i do
he says can you show it to me and i say
what kind of neanderthal are you
this is 2021 jack we don't
show id that's a little bit
discriminatory but i'll tell you what i
will do
i will promise you that i'm really who i
say
are we good and the cop says whoa now
that you put it that way
i was thinking that some kind of
government id would be the only way i
could tell
reliably whether you are who you say but
now that you've offered this alternative
where you simply promise me that you are
would you write it would you put that in
writing
yes i would all right here's a forum
just sign it that says you're really you
you swear to god you're really you
okay
here you go and we're good
right if you uh
if you're like uh this uh comedian uh
was it chris or something
who's the comedian who just got in
trouble for doing naughty things online
with
a 17 year old allegedly
now if the problem is that the 17 year
old is under 18
i guess that is the problem
i feel as if chris should be let off
as long as she promised that she was
over 18
cause why would she need to show him id
when she could just promise
just say for sure i'm over 18. i think
we should take this as a standard too
if you're writing a check at the store
and the the store says i'd like to see
some id
here's what i'm going to say can i i'll
just write it right on the check
i promise i am really the named person
who is named on this check
scott adams i'll show it to the store
and they'll say
uh that's not really id that's just you
promising that you're
really this person and i'll say have you
heard of the united states government
neanderthal you probably haven't
the united states government the
congress if you heard a congress
they say that promising you are who you
are
is just as good so
let's be taking this check guys snap it
up
talk so i think we should even take an
attitude about it
rather than when anybody asks you for
identification
you should just look at them like
they've got a turd hanging out of their
mouth
and just say oh my god
who are you asking me for id
i promise you i'm who i say if you need
more than that
that's voter suppression or something
discrimination at the very least
um but that's not all daniel dale did
more fact-checking
because we can't have mike pence out
there saying stuff
so here's another um
let's see uh oh and pence made an
outrageous claim
an outrageous claim that but luckily
daniel dale was there to catch it
because this could have just slid right
through if daniel dale had not flagged
it for you so
so pence makes the outrageous claim
uh in his article that he wrote claiming
that the election involved
and this is a quote this is not for me
this is from crazy mike pence okay
not for me so i can't get canceled for
this right
i'm just quoting this neanderthal mike
pence
and he said that the 2020 election
involved significant voting
irregularities that's him that's him
that's not me
i would never say such a thing but mike
pence
says it involved a significant voting
irregularities now daniel dale
fact-checks him hard
he fact-checks him so hard he checks him
right into the wall he says
that unlike trump pence did not say that
the election involved quote
fraud but he left his vaguer
claim about voting irregularities
wide open wide open for readers to
interpret it as an
endorsement of trump's fraud lie
that's right so when pence
notes irregularities what do you think
he was
referring to could it be that this
election
violated every what do you call it uh
bellwether indicator of who should win
would you say that the irregularities
would be anything that is off regular
that's what the word means right so if
there's something that
regularly happens such as
every time you win these certain
counties you win the presidency
that regularly happens such as winning
some high percentage of the primary vote
which has
historically guaranteed you would become
president
but it didn't happen this time so
regularly it happens
but not this time were there other
statistics
which you could look at and say you know
that's never happened before
yes there are a lot of things that
regularly happened in the past didn't
happen this time
so is mike pence saying something that
is untrue
even a little bit no
there's not anything that's even a
little bit
wrong with what pence said is it true
that people might interpret it voting
irregularities
as being voter fraud yes that's possible
it's called people being bad at reading
that's a thing do you think that fact
checking
is the right the right thing to employ
for anything that might be
misinterpreted
do you know what else might be
misinterpreted
everything i've ever tweeted
everything everything i've
ever put in words has a high chance of
being misinterpreted
how do i know that because everything
i've ever put in words has been
misinterpreted
by somebody you know not everybody
but everything i've written has been
misinterpreted
so therefore is everything i say
a lie because i know that i'll be
misinterpreted
i know that there's no chance there
won't be it always is
so better fact check me hard
because sometimes people misinterpret me
and therefore that's my fault
a liar in a way
so uh pence suggested
this is daniel dill fact checking again
suggested that the bill
this voting bill would allow
undocumented immigrants to register to
vote
well that's quite a claim you
neanderthal lying pence he's suggesting
that the bill would allow
undocumented immigrants to register well
that's not true
here's the facts the bill does not
change the current law that bans people
who aren't citizens
from voting so that's good so it didn't
it did not say undocumented non-citizens
can vote so it didn't say that all right
but what did it say uh daniel dale says
the bill makes clear that people would
still have to affirm
interesting choice of words affirm
how how would they affirm it let's let's
go on they would have to affirm that
they are uss citizens
before they are added to the voter rolls
it also says that the government
agencies involved in the process are to
inform only u.s citizens
that they will be registered to vote all
right but that's something that the
the government does but in terms of the
citizens themselves
they must affirm that they are u.s
citizens before they are allowed to vote
affirm sign a document that says you are
it's just a promise right so daniel dale
is
fact checking pence who is
i would say he could have added more
context to his statement
but i feel that neither of them did a
good job on this one
i don't think that pence was clear
enough and i don't think the
fact check was even slightly legitimate
on this
all right so that's kind of fake news
we're getting today
so here's the context we have
so we had this capital assault which was
the biggest news the last few months
right
so the capital was assaulted some say a
coup
some say an armed insurrection without
guns
i guess but
so we've got this hanging over our head
that the
election was not credible enough
to prevent a capital attack
how bad does your credibility have need
to be and i'm only talking about
credibility
not talking about any allegations of
fraud i'm not saying the
election was not accurate those are
separate claims
i'm saying that in terms of people's
minds
a huge number of citizens thought it was
not credible
and gave reasons as in lack of
transparency
as in we don't know if all the right
people were registered to vote et cetera
just lack of transparency so given that
that's the biggest problem we have right
now
wouldn't you say the biggest immediate
threat to the republic
is the country itself you know pulling
itself apart without any external
influence
and or at least not much of it
and at the same time to address
the biggest problem in the country
congress just voted to make it worse
that just happened the biggest problem
in the country
was a big part of the country let's say
one-third or half or whatever the number
is
not thinking that the elections are
credible the way the system is designed
independent of whether the result was
right
a big part of the country doesn't think
the system is even designed right
and then congress aggressively made it
worse
that was that was their response to
there's so low
credibility in the system that the
capital was attacked
or at least occupied let's say
how'd they fix it by making it worse and
they
they did it right in front of you it's
not like this is even an interpretation
do you think that the people who
attacked the capital
would be less inclined to attack because
now you just have to promise your
citizen to vote
that makes them less likely to attack
the next time
no no it doesn't it makes it more likely
how do you how do you look at the baby
and decide to make that a little worse
obviously worse i mean clearly obviously
worse
this is unambiguous
um so and then there's complaints that
the republicans are just trying to
change the rules
because it will give them an advantage
wasn't that what the democrats just did
they just changed the rules to give
their team an advantage
it's either legal or it isn't if the
stuff you're doing
is legal and you're doing it through the
courts and the
and the uh elected officials
you can change the rules to benefit your
side
it's not illegal it's just shitty
all right well um i'm trying to say this
without
um without being blamed for
inspiring or inciting insurrection
i don't know if you have enough national
guard on the capitol if you keep doing
this stuff
if you if you if you spit in the face of
the voters enough and this is just a
spit in the face
that's what this is this is an insult
this isn't even just bad work
this is an insult to a big part of the
country
um so it's adding insult to injury quite
literally and if you don't want trouble
you're going in the wrong direction all
right here's the most provocative uh
idea of the day and here's where you get
to have some fun
i'm gonna i'm gonna put something out
here that you as a
as a collective group could actually
make a big difference
in a national topic are you ready
and it's funny because it's so easy
there's something you can literally do
it could happen in the next few minutes
actually that would make a big
difference to a national topic
it goes like this i saw
jeff pilkington on twitter
he wondered why we don't have a poll
specific to female athletes under 40
to ask them what they think about
transgender
sports athletes playing on women's teams
now why is this important it's important
because women under 40
are strongly in favor of transgender
athletes
but that's just generally women not
every woman would be in any way
affected by the topic but what about the
people most
affected the people most affected the
victims if you will
uh and i don't i don't call them victims
by the way because as soon as you call
them victims
that's anti-lgbtq anti-transgender in my
opinion
it comes out that way so i don't think
there's a victim here
because no matter what you do there's
still just one winner
there's still just one winner everybody
else was going to lose no matter what
so if you take a situation where there
could only be one winner
and there's still just one winner i
don't know
doesn't feel like uh that's the worst
thing in the world
but that's just me so here's what i
would would wonder could we do a poll of
just female
athletes people who are actually
currently
currently involved in female sports
and i would say do it at the high school
college level
i don't think you needed to do it
professional level do you
you could throw them in there but it
gets better
you waiting for the good part right
here's the good part
rasmussen will do this poll
if they can find a sponsor sponsor
meaning money
so if there's anybody out there who has
access to some money
and you would like to see this poll it's
going to cost something because it's not
their normal polling setup
they would have to do a custom thing but
i just
i just talked to rasmussen and
they say that they'll take this
seriously you just need somebody to fund
it
so how would you like to know if women
athletes
under just say women athletes uh
under 40 is sort of automatic if you're
an athlete but
say women athletes just them and then
just
settle it based on that and just settle
it
because i think you know what's going to
happen i'm not positive
but i think the female athletes are
going to be pro
transgender athletes i'm not positive
but i think they will and they might be
like two to one
it might be overwhelming because
remember the women under 40
not exclusive to athletes but just women
under 40 were
i think like close to two-thirds of them
were pro-transgender athletes
so why do you care if they don't
you should not care more about somebody
else's victimization
than they do right the reason that i
care about the uyghurs
being imprisoned in china is that i feel
confident that they care about it too
right i don't believe if you checked in
with the uyghurs they'd say why are you
making all this noise
we're fine and we got we got food we're
good
no you should not be more angry at
somebody's victimization than the victim
let the victim tell you how angry you
should be right if you want to have some
empathy
all right
did you see the latest joe biden video
where it looks like nancy pelosi shut
off the feed when
he said he would take questions
you have to see this thing i will never
be bored
at looking at a new biden gaffe video
but this one's pretty good and it looks
like he just ran out of
life force or something you know i'll
paraphrase it but at the end of his
video whatever it was some kind of video
event
and he said well and uh i'll take
questions uh if that's what you want me
to do
and they just sit there looking confused
and they just cut the feed
he just offered the president of the
united states
just said he was willing to take
questions
and somebody else who is not the
president of the united states
decided he wasn't you watched that
in front of you because he said it as
clearly as possible i'll take
i'll take questions and then somebody
decided he wouldn't
just think about that and and people are
saying was
nancy pelosi cut it i don't know if
that's the case
but uh he and it made me wonder
if you made a deep fake imitation of
biden
and you nailed it somehow you could make
you
can't we're not there yet but somehow if
you could make a perfect
reproduction of biden nobody would think
it was real
because the real biden doesn't act like
a
sentient person it
because you would just need to make the
deep fake make no sense you'd be like oh
we'll take questions and you can nail it
you could
you could pass the uh the touring test
pretty easily
if you were trying to imitate biden
because you know what he's going to do
all the time or you know what people
will tell them to do
all right um
here's uh there's new news that china
is making all foreigners take mandatory
uh coven 19 anal swabs
that's right if you didn't have enough
reasons
not to visit china and there might be a
few
reasons you missed for example you might
not be aware that they kill 50 000
americans a year with fentanyl
intentionally maybe you didn't know that
so you're thinking yourself i'd like to
visit china
but you hear about that and you're like
i still want to visit
then you hear you know there is very
credible evidence
that they're harvesting organs from
political prisoners and
selling them to people who have money in
china
and you say well i know that
but i'm not a political prisoner i'd
really like to see china
i think i'll visit you say you're aware
that they have actual literal prison
camps
for their uyghur minority you knew that
right
to which i say i've heard a few things
about that
but you know i've been to a lot of other
countries and
i really like to visit china you know i
think i'd like to go there anyway
you know they're stealing our ip and
cheating on all of our deals right
yeah but i really like to i like to
visit that doesn't really talk me out of
it
you know the cities are so polluted
that you won't even be able to breathe
outdoors without a gas mask just to walk
down the street you know that right
i do know i do know that i saw something
about that but
still i would like to to visit
and then they say you know that china
will make you drop your pants and bend
over and they will shove an anal swab
up your ass just to let you in the
country
and then you say what
yeah yeah they'll actually make you bend
over they'll shove something right up
your ass because you're a foreigner
i really want to visit china though well
if you didn't have enough reasons to not
visit
 china there's a good one all
right
barry weiss has a really good article in
deseret
news and it's about how
uh the left is killing itself
with their own with their own rules
and the the uh the gist of it is
that young professionals who are left
so people who are on the left they're
scared to death
of talking uh honestly to
anybody even a friend
that if you're on the left they're
actually afraid
of talking to a friend
privately
do you feel that yet if you
if you lean right let's say you're more
conservative
most of this audience probably is have
you ever felt
uh that it was dangerous to talk
privately to a friend
i haven't i don't think i can think of
one example where i ever edited myself
privately to a friend
like you know there are always things
that you don't say to some people right
but
i never worried about it i never thought
what if my friend
tells somebody what i said now i suppose
it's a risk especially if you're a
public figure
you know people could actually take
something i said privately and
make something out of it in the news or
social media but i've never once worried
about it
never once literally it's never crossed
my mind
but if you're if you're uh left leaning
and you're a professional
the example that barry weiss gave was
lawyers
they're actually literally afraid of
what their friends
will say because they're afraid of their
friends
because of all the wokeness oh my god
i'm glad i'm not part of that all right
even though i'm left at bernie
i'm still not crazy so
i always say i'm left to bernie but
better at math which ends up
you don't get to do a lot of bernie
stuff because if you're good at math it
doesn't make sense
um here is my last point and the most
interesting one
it's only half developed so you might
have to do
you know look into this if you care um
there's a uh there's a thought
from um hoffman who is is he a
physicist or a philosopher i can't
remember but
he's got an idea that the universe is
nothing but consciousness
and that there's no there might not
be any physical stuff anywhere that is
just
consciousness looking at other
consciousness and when you say that you
say to yourself
what the heck is consciousness then how
do you define that
and the idea is that in quantum physics
and i'm going to mess up
i'm going to get all this wrong so go go
google uh
hoffman and ted talk and reality and
you'll get the the good version
but the idea is
that we know from quantum physics that
nothing exists exactly
until it's observed in other words if a
human sees something
the the probability wave collapses to
use their words
and then that's real from that point on
and if you go back and somebody else
checks
still real stays there but until
something is
witnessed by something intelligent
and this will be or something conscious
they'll say
and i'll define that in a moment it
doesn't really exist
it's just a probability stew that's just
well it could be could be until somebody
sees it but seeing it doesn't require a
uh let's say a sentient
entity the the process of seeing
something
could be a device so if you had a
detection device
and it detects something that collapses
the wave just like if
a person saw it so anything that
can be changed by um sort of existing
or interacting or observing anything
else
it becomes real once anything else
reacts to it
does that make sense so instead of
saying using words like consciousness
i'm replacing that with like a like a
cleaner simpler definition
which is anything that responds
or any anything that would cause
something else to have a reaction to it
let me give you a trivial example if
if if if you were the only thing that
existed
in the emptiness of space and a meteor
went by
that being the only other thing and you
saw it
i guess you need one other thing the sun
and there's some stars and there's some
sun
the light would bounce off that meteor
and then that light would hit your eyes
and that would be like an interaction so
that would be like intelligence
because something got registered
something changed
so my brain registered the light
reflecting off the meteor
that became a memory or some slight
change
and that slight change became like a
recording
or let's say it collapsed
it collapsed the reality into one
reality
now hoffman takes it to the next level
apparently
in which he says we don't have proof
that there's anything
physical here at all all we have is
like consciousness looking at
consciousness now i can't quite get
there
like my brain doesn't even know what
that means but
we're getting really close to
understanding
something a lot deeper about what all
this is
and i feel as though
it's going to be one of the biggest
points of enlightenment in human
experience and the way hoffman explains
it and by the way this is the way i've
explained
and viewed reality for a long time
which is that everything you see and
touch is more like a user interface
and the example used is that on your
computer screen there's a little
icon for the garbage pail but the little
icon of the garbage pail is not a
garbage mail
it's a representation of something that
you know how to use it by dragging
things into it
but it doesn't exist in the real world
it's like a it's like an
icon or a user interface you don't know
what's happening behind that
because you're not a programmer you
don't know what the bits are doing you
just see the the front
the icon and the idea is that
everything's like that
everything in reality is just a your
brain has turned it into an icon
you don't know why anything works you
just know if you push this button a
pellet comes out and if you push this
button
a pellet doesn't come out that's all you
know
and you don't know anything else this
one's got a pellet this one doesn't
but you don't know what's behind the
button and nobody and nobody does
now what are the implications of this
let me tell you one and this is the fun
part
if you read uh any of my books some of
them behind me
you know i talk about affirmations and
and trying to steer your reality by just
focusing and maybe repeating or writing
down the thing you want to happen
if it's true that our world is
consciousness
and um flexible to our
our minds meaning meaning that we're
inventing the reality as we go
it doesn't exist we're inventing it
how flexible is that how much of a
different reality
could you invent if you were just taking
it like an
artist instead of a scientist look at my
life
for my entire adult life
i've believed that reality was
subjective
to the point where i could manipulate it
and create a subjective life
that i could live in just like it was
real
and in theory all of us are living in a
subjective reality just like it's real
but i said to myself if it is subjective
can't i program it if it's objective
then i don't have much control over it
except the things i directly touch
but if our reality is subjective a
product of the mind
and there are lots of different ways you
could create a subjective reality
one says i'm the greatest person and i'm
happy the other says
i have no confidence and i'm unhappy but
all the rest is the same
it's just how you're interpreting it so
if you can interpret it differently
how much differently is it just that you
could be
happy or unhappy in the same scenario
is that the limit of what you can change
or can you change
the stuff if you believe that the only
thing you can change is how you think
about
the stuff maybe maybe
perfectly reasonable assumption but we
haven't ruled out that you can change
your external environment
in a practical way practical means that
you can live within this artificial
reality and it never hurts you
and it only helps you so you can have
different
different filters on your reality that
work perfectly
as long as you can also mate and
reproduce right it's the only
requirement
so look at my life from the outside
at the age of six or something i said
that i wanted to be a famous cartoonist
and rich
as a cartoonist do you know how few
cartoonists
in the world are rich a lot of
cartoonists
but do you know how few actually got
rich
it's almost none i mean it's out of 7
billion people i don't know 20
20 maybe out of 7 billion
so did i create this reality
and do you see the same one i see or do
you even
have do you even experience a reality in
which i exist
and i'm a cartoonist and i did well i
don't know
i have no way of knowing i only know
that i perceive it
so if you look at where my life
has gone and what i've done it would
look
to an observer like i had created it
just out of nothing because things go my
way
at a to a degree that doesn't make any
sense even to me
like it doesn't make any sense the
number of things that go my way
i can't explain it and
the subjective reality theory is the
only one that at least
is robust enough to explain a hundred
percent of what i see
i don't know that it's true in some
sense that
anything is true i know that it explains
everything
so i offer you this
i can tell um i've received uh i don't
know hundreds and hundreds of
messages from people who have read my
work they've tried this affirmation idea
the idea that they can
create their environment somehow it
might be a subjective one but they can
create it
and have reported that it's changed
their life in
major ways people are telling me they're
losing
45 pounds i heard that yesterday you
know 80 pounds
now some of it's using a system and not
a goal but a
number of people tell me that they
basically just
carved their subjective reality into a
whole new thing
and they did it by simply having the
intention to do that
i told you before the the spookiest
conversation i've ever had was with the
founder and ceo of salesforce mark
benioff and he talks about the
importance of
intention and intention
is that thing that you're putting into
the universe that's
that's modifying reality and
i didn't ask him this question directly
but i'll bet mark benioff has a
sensation
that he is creating reality because it
looks like he is
or at least some subjective reality that
i also live in
so if you focus your intentions
uh you might find that your subjective
reality starts
wrapping around those intentions in a
way that you cannot explain
there is no science that can explain it
and it might just be an illusion
but i'll tell you if this is an illusion
if it's an illusion that my life dream
of becoming a cartoonist actually
happened and that i get to do this every
day
if this is an illusion i'll take it
pretty happy with it all right so that's
what i got for today
somebody says that's what my art mentor
talks about all the time
sounds like you have a good mentor um
just looking at something i just want to
see some of your comments because i want
to see if i went too far
every thought is a limit oh i like that
thought
just deal with that thought this just
came in from a comment
every thought is a limit
yeah you have to you're gonna have to
roll that one around for a while
every thought is a limit it reminds me
of uh
freedom's just another word for nothing
left to lose
have you ever been in a situation where
things went so badly
that you gained freedom and you thought
to yourself
what's this i'm feeling oh it's
something everything went so badly
that now i'm free freedom is
is just another word for nothing left to
lose once you realize that it's a it's a
real
it's real mind bender and it's also true
that having complete power and having no
power whatsoever
turn out to be the same thing and by the
way
if you don't know that that will
that will place you on your level of
awareness if you're
if you're trying to figure out where do
i rank
on awareness here's a good test
do you understand what i mean when i say
that having complete power
and having no power at all are identical
if you don't
maybe you will and if you do
you know exactly what i just said so
there are some uh
some little ways you can test yourself
along the way
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you tomorrow
all right um
the homeless guy does have freedom
well the homeless guy doesn't have money
so money would help
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you tomorrow
