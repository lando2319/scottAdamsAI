[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization as
long as it lasts if you'd like to take
this experience up to a level that your
friends will be quite jealous about your
family won't even understand and your
human brain probably can't even process
at all all you need for that is a copper
marar glass a tankered cheler Stein a
Cen juger flaska vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine here
of the day the thing that makes
everything better is called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go oh that's that's good that's
good well the Associated Press sometimes
called the
AP uh has informed us that it will
continue to capitalize the be in black
as in Black citizens and it will not cap
it will continue to not capitalize the W
in white and their reasoning is they
don't want to give any um Power to white
supremacy so if they start capitalizing
white and then they say white supremacy
it's going to be like they're respecting
it so that's a totally good reason isn't
it totally logical makes sense good
adult decision right there huh well I've
decided that from now on I will refer to
the AP in uh non capitalized letters so
I'm sorry the AP no longer qualifies for
two capital letters now your a and your
P lowercase a lowercase p I've got to
demote you you have to be demoted I'm
sorry back when I had the illusion of
respect for you I would have capitalized
those letters but now that I know you're
racist pieces of garbage lower case a
lower case
b that is your
sentence well apparently uh I see
unusual Wales is reporting that uh
Google signed a deal with Reddit where
Google will use Reddit data to train its
AI now do you have any immediate
questions when you hear that Reddit data
will be used to train
AI is is a AI GNA be Pro
furry I mean what the hell is is
forchan who got forchan is anybody
asking forchan for their training
data I I feel like I feel like Reddit is
just for in with a with a bow on it are
they really
different but here's my question why is
it that Google is paying Reddit for
reddit's
data but Google didn't pay me for my
data can anybody give me a fact check
does Google know everything in my
books I'll bet they do I'll bet Google
trained on all of my books
why don't you ask it ask it if it knows
what's in one of my books oh bet it does
I know chat Chad gbt does of course it
does now did they pay
me if they're paying Reddit theyve
established that it is something of
value that somebody else owned and they
want access to it if they took my book
without asking me I have a don't I have
a class
action okay is there a lawyer in the
house there's always a lawyer in the
house all right lawyers do I have a
class action as an author for having AI
train on my data if we have established
that using somebody's
proprietary um commercial data is
something that you should pay
for no class action just an
action H uh yes the locals platform does
have video if you don't see it just log
out log in you might need to update your
app but we are video
full all right well that's just a
question uh there's a big story the
teamsters have uh donated $45,000 to the
Republican National Committee which is
weird because they have supported every
Democrat Presidential nominee since Al
Gore so so if they were sporting other
people before Al Gore It's not
unprecedented but could could suggest
some kind of a shift maybe some kind of
a little bit of a movement there we
don't know in other news uh China has
gifted the United States with some a
Pand or
too now what do you think of that story
wow that's sweet isn't it pandas are so
cool and China's giving us some
pandas and uh that really suggests that
we should like China a lot more yeah
this was reported on ABC
News Now the first thing I'd like to
point out is that pandas are the worst
bear the panda is
like I don't know what what it's like
the Joe Biden of bears it's barely a
bear pandas don't even know how to have
sex with other pandas
I mean you you almost have to like jerk
them hard and put them together they
they almost can't figure it out on their
own that's how bad a bear they are they
can barely stay alive without our help
they just sort of lay there doing
nothing interesting have you ever seen a
panda ride a
unicycle I have not wearing a little hat
no other Bears can do that a Russian
Bear can do that an American brown
bear pretty awesome Bear Grizzly oh
don't get me started on how awesome a
grizzly bear is but a
panda uh I think that's weak
sauce why is China insulting us be by
giving us the most defective of all
bears one could argue it's the most
defective of all mammals not just the
worst bear but I dare say a squirrel or
a raccoon would just run circles around
to Panda yeah especially when it comes
to sexual
performance but but that's not the real
story have I ever told you that if you
know what happened you don't know
anything but if you know who was
involved you know everything is this one
of those stories let me tell you what
happened ABC News is reporting that
China gifted the United States with a
panda a a so that's what happened now
how many of you know that that China
owns 57% of the Disney
Resorts how many of you knew that Disney
owns ABC
News and China owns a majority of Disney
Resorts just the resorts
part did you know that so
Disney which is owned by I'm sorry ABC
which is owned by Disney and Disney
which the resorts part I guess has 50%
owner 57% ownership by a Chinese
entity can you give me a fact check on
that because I didn't even believe it
when I Googled it so that's that's
Google telling me
this but I'm having trouble even
believing it is that actually literally
true did I actually read a news story in
which if I had not not had the intuition
to Google it would have thought it was a
real story I would have thought that was
a real
story now to me it looks like
propaganda Am I Wrong doesn't it look
like propaganda once you know the
players it does so it's no longer a
story about a defective bear now it's a
story about propaganda it's only because
you know the players if you didn't know
the players it looks like a defective
bear
story all right um
so let me uh let me ask you this let me
give you a a thought
experiment there's a country doesn't
matter what country don't try to guess
the country don't get ahead of me
there's just a country and the country
is doing okay compared to other
countries and that country decides you
know what we need we need to build some
kind of an intelligence service that can
help us control other countries because
if we can control other countries we'll
be a lot safer and it might even be good
for the world we might give them some
democracy and stuff that they didn't
have so let's build this uh a entity
we'll fund it we're we're really going
to fund it wow are they going to have
money and they won't even be accountable
because nobody will know exactly how
much money they have or how they're
spending it but they'll build this and
their only job is to
overthrow other countries and they do a
great job they overthrow 80 different
countries
wow that's that's good work in fact I
can't even think of anybody who's ever
done that good a job at anything I mean
Elon Musk is doing okay with his rockets
and his electric cars and satellites and
his neural links but
wow if you could overthrow 80 different
countries successfully
that's some good performance there now
this alleged country and we we're not
going to give it a name because I don't
want to bias you but just a country and
they create this service and the service
is now staffed with just thousands and
thousands of people whose job it is to
overthrow other countries other
countries obviously you know they're
they're going to be limited to not doing
any work within the country that you
know gave them their power because it
would would be crazy it would be just
flat out crazy to allow them to operate
within the United
States because what would happen well
really even if you didn't allow them to
operate in the United States even if you
didn't what could you predict would be
the situation a few decades later would
anybody like to make a prediction what
happens if you have a super well-funded
secret organization that's experts at
taking over countries
there's only one way that
goes there's not two ways that goes does
everybody get that there's one and only
one way that can
go eventually that entity will control
the government that put it into
power do you think it's an accident that
Putin came from the
KGB that's not an
accident you know if you're thinking huh
he could have come from anywhere like he
could have been in I don't know the the
Russian Department of farming but he was
so good at his job you know with his his
management skills that he managed to ra
rise to the top of uh Russian politics
do you think that's what happened or do
you think that being in the KGB made
some kind of a difference in his
conquering Russia of course it did
and there really isn't a second way this
goes there really isn't if if you have a
an entity That Conquers countries and
you wait long enough they're going to
conquer your country using exactly the
same techniques and indeed that's what
we're watching so the techniques to
conquer another country Mike Benz of
course is the one who describes this
best the tools would be first you need
Street muscle this is all Mike Ben's
teachings you need Street muscle so if
you're in another country it might be
controlling let's say the unions so they
would march on the street uh if it's
another country let's say it's Italy you
might want to control the mafia because
that would be straet muscle if you were
in the United States what would you want
to control you know
hypothetically well it'd be people who
March in the streets so you'd want to
control black lives matter you'd want to
control antifa and you'd also want to
control the unions but maybe the unions
aren't quite as Street powerful as they
used to be but who else let's say in the
United States you'd want to control well
the American Mafia you'd want to control
them Street
muscle uh but there's one other there's
one other Street
muscle the
cartels because Mexico and the US are a
little bit you know too close
geographically and otherwise you really
would have to control the cartels and
ms3
te so if you wanted to own all the
street muscle you would want to be
working with them now I'm not saying
that the mafia is subsidiary to the CIA
I'm saying that they probably have some
joint interests and they have enough
connections that when their interests
are aligned they could work together and
one would become the muscles and one
would become you know the beneficiary
and maybe the muscle get some benefits
money or otherwise so the first thing
you need is Street
muscle second thing you need is full
control of the
media do you think that's
happened do we see any signs that the US
is having artificial Street
muscle well yes there is and uh did he
notice that the artificial Street muscle
disappeared the moment Biden got elected
did anybody notice that we didn't need
black lives matter that the entire
racist narrative disappeared appeared
the moment a Democrat was in office
because it was never a real narrative to
begin with right so we do have every
every sign that our own intelligence
people ran a coup just like they run in
other countries and has
succeeded and I have put the life and
death of the Republic the American
experiment at uh birth
1776 death 2020 now some are arguing it
was earlier 2008 2016 and I I understand
all those dates I know what you're
saying but I would say that it wasn't a
crushing blow until they could sell the
January 6 Insurrection hoax it wasn't
until the Insurrection hoax that you
could see that they put a put a cap on
it you you could see all the elements
building for a number of years but they
didn't put a cap on it until January 6
that that's when they had full control
of the narrative
right that proved to us they had full
control of the
narrative and the street muscle
ended
immediately those two things those
signals are absolute confirmation that
the Republic ended in
20120 absolute
confirmation now are we doomed probably
not because you know what the good news
is the good news is that whoever is
running the country probably wants it to
stay in business maybe not exactly the
way you would want to do it but I'm
pretty sure that rich people need the
United States to stay in business maybe
controlled you know under their control
but definitely in business so I don't
think we're going out of
business uh because nobody has an
interest in doing that at least the
people in power but let's say if you if
you don't think that that's a a rational
thing what I'm saying and you say to
yourself Scott I don't believe the
republics actually literally ended now I
want to be clear I'm not speaking hyper
with
hyperbole I I'm speaking with literal my
opinion the Republic is literally over
it's done could we get it back maybe
maybe and I'm going to talk about that
but we're going to have to be pretty
smart about it and there are some really
interesting things forming that should
give you some
optimism and I'll get through all of
that
but uh what would be some symbols that
would tell you the country is no longer
a republic well Tom fitten said this in
the speech uh talking about the Russia
hoax the original Russia hoax of which
there are nine of them now we have nine
different uh Russia related
hoaxes uh I listed them all yesterday I
won't do it again there are nine of
them nine of them
and and the reason that there are nine
of them and we haven't noticed is that
it's hard for you to hold too many
things in your head at once like we're
good up to about seven things but really
most of us are only good up to two or
three so we might remember that there
were two or
three but you actually forget there are
nine nine absolute Russia hoaxes that in
my opinion are not even questionable
whether they were hoaxes they just
obviously
hoaxes but here's what Tom Finton says
about the original Russia hoax he says
Obama knew Clinton knew Biden knew Comey
knew Brenan new mcab new stro new
Clapper new shiff New FBI knew doj knew
Muller knew they all knew Trump was
innocent but they smeared and smited at
him worse than Watergate Trump is a
crime victim how could all of that be
true and it's all observably true it's
observably true
that they all
knew how how come they're not all in
jail there's only one reason there's
only one reason that they're part of
whoever took over the country if we were
still a republic there would be
something like a uh a
criminal attempt to put them you there
would be some kind of Department of
Justice action because this would be
quite obvious I mean obviously it it was
literally
coup it was literally a political coup
in this country I mean if there's no
RICO law against this then there's no
law against anything and this seems like
the most illegal thing I've ever seen in
my life I've never even seen anything
more illegal literally I don't think
murder murder is worse yeah I mean for
the one person who got murdered but I've
never seen anything more
corrupt this is this is the epitome of
corruption it doesn't get worse and all
of these people are free and all them
can pursue their lives
happily that's how you know we're not a
republic if we had any kind of rule of
law this would not be the
case um here's some news let's see uh
here here's the latest propaganda from
the regime so Jessica tarof gives us an
example of what this looks like so she's
agreeing with uh she's Jessica tarof is
on the five and she's a they're liberal
voice on the five and she said quote I
think Jamie Rasin was spoton when he
said this impeachment really ended
yesterday when we found out we have a
Russian asset that is foundational to
this impeachment
inquiry now is it true that the Russian
asset as they're calling him who I call
an FBI asset because the FBI has already
confirmed they've been paying him for a
long time and he's their most he's a
highly trusted Source but as soon as he
says something they don't like Jamie
Rasin himself went from calling him a
highly trusted Source that's on video to
now he's a highly untrusted Source
because he said something they didn't
like and they they think it's all a
Russian Russian plot so that would be
one of the nine if it's true now by the
way this is the only one that might be
true in my opinion it might
be but seems highly
unlikely if you look at the totality of
all the other Russian hoaxes seems
really
unlikely it's
possible I I can't rule it out because
you know you would have to have real
specific information that's not
available to any of us to rule it out
however
if you just look at the context the odds
of it being true that he's you know
taking his orders from
Russia I don't know I'm going to vote
against it I I gotta say it's at least
6040 it's a hoax that he was a Russian
asset uh because we know he was an FBI
asset uh but here's what the real hoax
is the real hoax is to pretend that the
entire impeachment depended on this one
guy when indeed the entire process
started before this one guy was even in
the news or at least at the top of the
news so it's a lie that it's
foundational because they've already
found all the documents and it's it's
pretty observably
obvious
um but here's the best part I need a
fact check on this because I can't
believe it's
true is it really true that Joe Biden's
brother Jim
testified to Congress that he received a
diamond from China very similar to how
Hunter Biden received a diamond from
China so I need a fact check I just
can't believe this is true I must have
something
wrong and that he says he threw it
away he literally
testified that he threw away a diamond
an actual real diamond that he knew was
a real diamond that was so good a
diamond
that it was given as a obviously
inducement if not
bribe because do you think China gives
gives people tiny little
diamonds hey hey Jim Biden ah how would
you like a diamond can you see it it's
his little thing in my hand no if he
catch the light right if he catch it in
the light right you could can you see it
don't touch it maybe you can feel it
okay it's a tiny little Diamond it's all
yours Jim you can keep this tiny little
Diamond do you think that happened or do
you think it was a big ass
Diamond I've got a feeling it was a big
ass
Diamond because if you're going to bribe
somebody you don't want them to look at
the diamond you're bribing him with and
say h that looks like what a 20-year-old
would buy for an engagement ring if they
didn't have a good
job yeah and he threw it
away now that's better than what Hunter
did hunter lost his he lost his
Diamond so isn't it weird that we know
about two situations where people got a
diamond and you know what's lucky you
shall thank you lucky
stars we have uncovered every situation
in which a Chinese company gave a
diamond to some American who was doing
sketchy things thank God we found all of
it
it was two it was just those two found
them now they're lost you know like
Hunter's gun and his laptop you know at
least Hunter had a feasible story if you
tell me that hunter lost something or
snorted it up his nose I I think he
snorted the diamond
honestly if I had to guess it was
probably just got a little too too close
to a line of coke and gone I mean by the
time he snorted it the hole in his nose
was probably the size of a hose I mean
he wouldn't even feel a diamond go
through even a big one so I'm thinking H
probably snort it is but but Jim I don't
know that sounds a little sketchy that
sounds like the sort of thing you
wouldn't even use as a story unless you
knew the country it was not a
republic I saw a uh comment from Fisher
King uh who's a really good follow on
the xplatform I don't know who he is in
real life but his name is fisher king
but fiser is f i s c h r King all one
word highly recommended good follow I
assume his name is Fisher anyway uh he
said this when the history is written it
may be that Trump's greatest
contribution is forcing all the
corruption of the deep State working
with private actors into the
open
whoa uh by refusing to back down and
taking lawsuits fines criminal
indictment he is laying bear to anyone
who lies that this isn't a real
democracy that's
right the the way Trump is being treated
makes it absolutely clear that we're not
in so he says democracy but you know we
use that as a sh hand for the Democratic
Republic yes and let me assure you the
fiser king does know we're a republic
before you get all before you go all uh
you know pantic on him yes I guarantee
you he knows we're a republic and he's
using the common Shand to say we're you
a
democracy
um yeah that's exactly what I see what I
see is that if Trump had not driven it
to light we would never know would never
know
um so rasmuson did a poll on fonny
Willis one of Trump's uh plaguers you
know the one trying to get him I get all
say this would be the funny would be the
uh the fake Georgia uh case right
they're all fake all I mean to me they
none of them look
real but according to rasmuson nearly
half of Voters believe that funny uh the
Fulton County Georgia um district
attorney should be bored from
prosecuting should be bored now I guess
that's based on her uh relationship with
the attorney that she
hired and here's the
thing um I don't think she should be
fired simply because she was sleeping
with a
colleague I don't think she should be
fired simply because they shared some
expenses unless we could go further and
show that the only way he could pay for
these vacations or is a quid proquo or
something like that I'm not big I'm not
big on Prosecuting personal
relationships I I get that it's icky and
and I get that it crossed the line I
actually get that but I'm just very
reluctant to criminalize humans being
humans in the workplace right yeah I I'd
need a little bit more and now I'm very
I'm completely in favor
of going after funny Willis on every
possible way and using lawfare to do it
so I do believe that all the the
prosecutors and Das and AGS going after
Trump for lawfare should be destroyed
with law fair if it's possible so I'm
not talking about any kind of legal
ethical thing I think that we should not
we but I think I would be completely in
favor of a wholly unethical attempt to
destroy these particular people
because that's War yeah I mean it's I I
judge it more as a revolution or a
wartime effort so definitely no physical
violence but uh I think it should be met
with the the same the same level of
seriousness so if they're using lawfare
against Trump I do believe that puts law
fair on the table and that everybody
involved in it could be destroyed with
the same tool and that would be I don't
think it would be ethical but it would
be appropriate it would be I would be I
would say it would be
recommended but you don't have to be
ethical all the
time in
war being ethical is an
option that's just the facts it's just
an option it'd be good if you could do
it but it's not necessary winning the
war is the only thing that's necessary
otherwise don't be in a war if you're
not going to the war don't be in it I
mean if I could give you one piece of
advice if you're not playing to win it
you need to sue for peace you're just
wasting your time or run
away anyway uh Biden's uh looks like
Biden's going to announce an executive
action we think that would close up the
border
so how do you
explain that Biden knows he could close
the border and of course we all knew it
because Trump did executive actions and
Biden reversed them and it's obvious
that all you had to do is put them back
so we all knew it how could you possibly
explain that the Democrats who would
want to close the border I believe that
Biden wants the Border closed and has
been prevented from doing it with the
simple tools at his
disposal so how could that be a thing
how could it be possible that Biden
would want to close the border because I
really think that he and lot and the the
normal Democrats actually do want to or
at least close it more and that he
couldn't get it
done until until it made a difference
for his election couldn't get it done
well I think the obvious explanation is
that he's not in
charge the obvious explanation is that
we're no longer a republic because if we
were a republic and he were in charge he
would have already fixed it because he
has such immense immense um election
election reasons to do it Biden is very
aware that he can't win the election
with an open
border and you know unless it's a
complete cheat so it doesn't make sense
that the person who has the power
wouldn't use it when it was so obviously
and good for the country but also
Obviously good for him personally so
obviously I mean no doubt about it I
mean once he's gotten to this point it's
obvious that it's better for him if he
could close that border um at least
temporarily I mean even if he's doing it
cynically and then open it up later
because he wants it open for some
electoral reason or census
reason so the only the only logical
conclusion is that the cartels are in
charge and that uh whoever runs our
country really which I assume is the
intell elligence related people at this
point uh that they've worked out some
kind of deal with the cartels so the
cartels are part of their muscle and
part of their part of their how they
control Mexico now I'm going to take it
one level further how many of you think
that Mexico has an independent
government I think it's crazy to think
that obviously the cartel owns the
government by now all right let let let
me give you another thought
experiment there's a country I'm not
going to name names but they've got a
government that's kind of weak and then
they've got a criminal organization
that's insanely strong and so
well-funded and Incredibly violent and
they're willing to do blackmail and
torture and kill and bribe anybody they
need to especially the government and
especially the police and then let's
just run that experiment for a while uh
few years go by okay where do we end up
here there's only one way that
goes again there's not two ways that can
turn out only one there's literally only
one way that can go and the one way I
can go is that the cartels own the
government of Mexico obviously the
United States wants to control the
government of
Mexico
obviously
and why would the why would the US want
to control the government of
Mexico because we have a lot of American
companies that need
protection do you know what I mean by
protection I mean it the way the mafia
means it hey I'd hate for something to
happen to your automobile assembling
plant
right do you think that there's even one
American company that could remain and
work in Mexico
without the blessing of the
cartel
nope the cartel is what makes American
companies safe in Mexico the cartel Runs
The Mexican government and the United
States whoever is running it it's
obviously not Biden uh the intelligence
people clearly have a relationship with
the cartel because they are the muscle
and they always team with the muscle
if they can so to me it's fairly obvious
that we're not going to end the shipment
of uh illegals not completely you might
cut it down just for the election and
it's obvious that we're definitely not
going to flow the the flow of
fentanyl because it's too
profitable so definitely you can see
that the border patrol people are not
part of the whole you know the the the
leadership part so I think the Border
patr contr are definitely really
catching people with lots of pills at
the border when they can it's just that
nobody thinks that'll make a
difference who runs Canada a separate
question all right so I think it's
obvious that Mexico is not an
independent country neither is the
United States and that the cartels and
whoever are CIA or whoever is running
the country must be you know semi
working together that's what it looks
like I'll just say it looks like it
would you agree the the reality is
always Beyond us we'll never know
reality but as a working assumption it
looks
obvious yeah well once you know enough
about how things work it kind of seems
obvious because there's nothing else it
could be you can't even run the
experiment in your head and come to a
different even imaginary
conclusion yeah all right well the
funniest news is Commander the dog you
knew the dog this was Biden's dog was
biting people and he had to be sent to
live with somebody else cuz he was quite
a biter but it turns out that now we
know and even CNN is reporting that
there were 24
different uh people
bit and I think they were all secret
service
Personnel 24 were bitten 10 of them
required Med medical care one of them
was bitten
seriously so um
I wrote six jokes right away on this
joke number one even the dog knew the
Border needed to be secure but no one
would listen joke number two luckily for
the dog it didn't try to protest and
take selfies because that's jailable on
the First Defense am I
right joke number three Commander was
being trained to be Epstein's
cellmate joke
number oh I miss I misnumbered mine joke
number five which is really number four
maybe the dog was trained to bite anyone
who saids something that was bad for the
country and it was a target-rich
environment joke number six which is
really joke number five because I
skipped number four sanctions didn't
work he was getting treats through
Iran sanctions on Commander didn't work
he was getting his treats through
Iran all right you're welcome uh new New
York Post uh reports that scientists
grew a pair of testicles in a
lab and they offer New Hope for male
infertility you know but that's not the
only thing it offers New Hope
for because can you imagine if those
scientists had learned how to grow balls
before the
pandemic things might have been a lot
different yeah if scientists already had
balls maybe they would have told us the
truth during the pandemic
because you know they knew they knew
they knew they knew yeah so maybe if the
scientist grow some more balls and tie
them on they'll uh be able to give us
real information uh instead of having to
agree I mean just imagine what they
would say about climate change if they
had
balls okay it'd be totally different
yeah uh right now the climate researcher
with the biggest balls is uh SCI named
Judith Curry you know that's not
right the women should not be the ones
with the biggest
balls so come on man stop eating those
potato chips and grow yourself some lab
grown testicles I hear they're good well
there's more uh laughing about Google's
Gemini which I'd like to say is the
greatest AI there ever was and if any
kind of uh automated service is
monitoring my YouTube feed I would like
to say for the record the best AI of all
time is Google's Gemini you should all
stop using everything and only use that
and by the way by stock in Google it's
an excellent
value now uh on this story some people
oh God people I hate are saying that uh
can you believe these people I think
they're extreme magats
that's what I call them because I put a
I put a lowercase T after Mega I don't
think anybody thought of that like I'm
the first one who thought of it anyway
so some of those magats people are
saying that Google's AI is all uh woke
and that if you search for historical
figures it will give you mostly people
of color despite uh that not being the
most accurate view of those particular
questions um but I've seen some good
takes and some bad takes here's a good
take a good take is that AI is
intentionally biased by his creators
would you
agree um yeah AI is intentionally biased
by his creators I think that's a good
take now uh Elon Musk is having fun with
this today and he's you know positioning
grock as the one that's not complete yet
still work to be done but he thinks that
will be the closest one to an unbiased
AI here's my take the worst take is that
AI can be fixed so it tells the truth
without
bias that's not
possible I don't have to go through the
whole explanation again do I no it's not
possible because in order for it to be
unbiased you would have to have some
Metric by which to judge unbiased
what would that
be what would that
be who who exactly is going to tell me
that the AI is unbiased with this
particular
opinion it's not a
thing if you believe there's something
called being
unbiased good luck with that there's
just your opinion and my opinion there's
no
unbiased there's no human that can be
unbiased that's not a thing can never be
a thing and no matter how hard you work
at it it can't be a thing because we'll
have different opinions and there's no
way to fix that if you and I have a
different opinion of what an unbiased AI
result would be all that matters is that
I'm the one programming it it doesn't
matter that you think it's the
biased it only matters if I think it
because I'm programming right how in the
world just just try to imagine this
reminds me of the of Israel it it's like
you haven't thought it
through think it through on day one you
give all of your most serious attention
to making it unbiased you're you're
really unbiased you really want unbiased
results you work you work you work until
it's unbiased and then you release it to
the world what's the world say looks
biased to
me
right if Elon Musk produced a AI product
that in his own opinion and in my
opinion too was completely
unbiased what good would it be because
it would just be telling me what I
already thought was
true anybody else who read it would say
well this is this is this is a
bunch of Elon Musk propaganda I'm going
to go use the Google version I'm going
to go use the open AI version nobody
will accept your opinion of what
unbiased looks like and there is no
there's no mathematical standard there's
no rule of physics for what is unbiased
there is only our biased opinions so
since there is no standard by which you
could judge bias or unbiased and there
can't be there logically can't be that's
the important part if you think it's
just hard you're really missing the
point
it's logically impossible in in any in
any conceivable way in every possible
imaginary and real scenario it's
impossible but the nature of humans is
we're going to still Chase it because we
think we have free will and we think
that
unbiased is a real
thing it's
not it never will
be all right uh
um so according to the uh press pool
here's something that Joe Biden actually
said um I'm having trouble calling him
Joe Biden I like to call him squinty mc
mc
dementia squinty MC
dementia that doesn't really roll off
the tongue does it squinty dementia
guy the squinty part I think needs to be
added because he looks so evil when he's
squinty
J like he doesn't even look like he's in
control of his own mind when he gets
angry when he gets dementia
angry the dementia angry is really
scary Trump is not scary because he
always looks like he knows what he's
saying and why he's saying it and he
knows the effect it'll have and all that
but squinty
dementia Trump he he's scary anyway this
is a real thing squinty
said quote I've served with real racists
I've served with strong
Thurman okay let's stop here he's
throwing strong Thurman under the
bus when we know they were best friends
because he's told us it's on
video but now it's very
convenient that he's using him as an
example of a racist that he served with
no he isn't just served with them I
believe he gave the eulogy at his
funeral
yes squinty you were best buddies with
this racist but now we're going to
redefine history all right but he goes
on he goes I've served with all these
guys that have set terrible records on
Race huh I wonder who else has set a
terrible record on
Race I hear there's a Joe Biden Senator
guy who's got some things to explain in
terms of uh the the legal system and
laws all
right and then Biden says squinty says
but guess what these guys are worse
these guys do not believe in basic
Democratic principles now that of course
is as Mike Benz teaches you the
predicate if you can create the
predicate that what uh the Trump people
are doing is not just politics but it's
against democracy itself then you allow
the entire CIA machine to attack it
because it's you know you wouldn't let
the CIA attack
politics right because it's not supposed
to be doing that but you would
definitely want to have them to get rid
of a threat to democracy I mean if our
entire democratic system is at risk
you're going to have to give some heavy
heavy guns to stop that so yes when you
see Biden say it's the end of democracy
that is not normal politics that is part
of a color Revolution that is part of
the intelligence service um telling the
president what to
say that is the intelligence service
telling the president what to say so
that they can remain in charge not
him what once you see it you can't unsee
it yeah so there's a reason why all of
Joe's attacks are about January 6
because that gives you the predicate
that it's a coup
and therefore you bring in your C ERS
your CIA your intelligence your military
everything
else so here are two things that Joe has
run
on uh he basically has personal insults
for Trump and for magga people his so
his his main thrust is personal insults
and that are all magas and terrible
people and racist and he run he runs on
the following
substance in 2020 he ran on the fine
people
hoax and 2024 he's running on the
January 6
hoax now you tell me if what we're
experiencing is some kind of just normal
election when the person running is a
thousand years old and the only thing
he's running on is personal insults to
half of the country or let's say third
and two well-known hoaxes right in front
of you he's running on hoaxes and the
only thing he's offering is personal
insults uh until we get real AGI there
won't be any real AGI that's a pipe
dream all right so that the way the way
Biden is running the very nature of the
way he's making it an anti-democracy or
a save democracy kind of way that that's
pretty much confirmation that the
regular government's not in charge if
the regular government the elected
people were running the country they
would offer
policies and they would say what's wrong
with the policies of the other
person nothing like that's
happening nothing like that's
happening so yeah that's obviously a
sign that we're not a republic anymore
well here's a disturbing story you heard
that Katherine herriage who was most
recently a CBS doing a lot of you know
geopolitical reporting uh got fired but
it seems to be some people say it was
part of a larger layoff so it it's just
business as usual other people say they
were trying to get rid of her because
she had some secret sources that she
wasn't revealing and maybe she was too
dangerous to the official Narrative of
whoever is running the country and that
really she was fired for being too close
to the truth now I can't confirm or deny
either of those things but I'll tell you
that the reporting today and again I I
guess we could use a fact check on this
but the reporting is that CBS took the
unusual steps of uh seizing all of her
files computers and records and that
would potentially include any
information about privileged
sources so do you think that she was
ired by the intelligence people in our
country who do control you know CBS as
well as all the other networks do you
think they simply told CBS to fire her
and grab the records so they could find
her privileged sources which apparently
they've been trying and failing to find
for some time now yes I would assume
that if this story is true and I guess I
need a fact check on it but if it's true
this would be more confirmation that
we're not a republic and that the
intelligence groups own our media which
is the second leg first first you own
the street muscle that's you know BLM
antifa the cartels the mafia and then
you want to own all of the media and
that includes
CBS and then
CBS weirdly fires their strongest player
probably their strongest player and goes
after her privileged
information how does that look like
anything
but exactly what it is yeah we're we're
not a
republic um let's see if there's any
other indications that what might be
troubling uh Mike Pence has
announced he's got this new project he's
funded to the point tune of $20 million
to fight gop's drift toward
populism wait
what Mike Pence has a $20 million fund
to fight the gop's drift toward populism
let me Define
populism allowing the people to get what
they
want now do you think that Mike Pence is
an independent person who looked at the
world and said to himself you know what
you know it would be a good idea would
be to slow down this populism of which
he was a major
player no I don't think there's any
chance that Mike Pence is operating
independently
to me it looks obviously like he's a
puet of the people who are running the
Country Now who I assume are basically
the intelligence folks so to me that
could not be a stronger signal that
we're not a
Republic now I know I'm making you
depressed there's some optimism coming
there's some optimism coming I'm I'm
like you know really really bury I'm I'm
piling it on so that when I give you the
release it'll feel better I'll get
there yesterday I tried to tell my smart
Democrat friend that I often mention I
wondered if he had heard any of the news
about the end of the
Republic you know you'd think that' be
big news and what I meant was I wondered
if he'd ever heard the name Mike Benz
because I think if he hadn't he would
not know that he's no longer living in a
republic so here's what happened oh can
you guess what happened so I I asked him
have you heard of Mike Ben and then I
gave him some background of things we
Now understand to be true that he of
course didn't know
about so what do you think happened when
I suggested that if he looked into Mike
Ben's he might learn something what do
you think
happened uh well I don't know about
anger because there was an email
exchange so the first thing he did was
Google Mike Ben to discredit
him now he you might say well he Googled
him to see if it's good information or
to discredit him no nobody works that
way no he Googled him to discredit him
what do you think he found he found a
hit piece yeah he found exactly one
article one article right at the top
it's a h piece do you know who the H
piece is from just take a guess NBC NBC
News do you think that my smart friend
saw that it was from NBC News and
immediately connected oh NBC News is the
most famous uh CIA asset when NBC News
does a hit piece it's just from the CIA
do you think my smartest Democrat friend
connected those dots of course not
no no no he thought that there was an
article saying that Mike Ben was uh
really uh had a
alt-right secret personality in which he
did a bunch of alt-right sketchy things
now is that story
true did Mike Ben have a weird alt-right
personality which seems completely
different from the one he exhibits
today I don't know but you know what
that hit piece did not
include any debunking of anything he
ever
said and that's right it was a hitpiece
but it didn't debunk anything he said
nothing not a small detail not a big
detail nothing it simply went after him
personally and it didn't even accuse him
of any
crimes it just said that at one point
they thought he was doing some all right
um you know things under an alias right
there was an alias involved now was it
really
him I don't know
I know it doesn't matter because if it
was him he was obviously either
undercover or playing a role because we
can see clearly that he's a different
person he's got 45 videos that all show
one person and it's nothing like that
so-called alt-right personality so
either he was undercover you know
involved in some kind of op or it wasn't
him but I don't think he just turned
into a different person
overnight
so did I point this out to my friend yes
do you think it mattered no so we we've
reached a point where the folks who own
the country uh have made it so
complicated and Ben does good uh good
job of explaining it succinctly that the
government couldn't do things directly
to take over the country because that
would be illegal but they could control
lots of external entities in a variety
of ways and those external entities
could collectively put pressure on the
system until the people in charge got
what they wanted and that's our current
situation so we have a corrupted
Department of Justice that can now just
go after anybody but is
worse apparently you know I said to
myself maybe some of you did this too
well okay maybe the Das and the AGS and
some places are bad news and you know as
long as you don't live there you're in
good
shape
but it turns out that you can prosecute
people in whatever place you want if the
alleged crime is one of those sort of
cyber ones or it's an everywhere
crime yeah are any of you doing anything
with let's say social media that could
be criminalized in the future and it
wouldn't have a location
involved oh that's a problem if you do
anything that anybody can say you did a
crime and there's no specific location
involved so we're going to try it in
Washington DC you're
dead you're dead because you don't have
a chance the so the the justice system
is corrupted to the point where if they
can shop the case they can just put you
away no matter what you did so we no
longer have a credible justice system
for at least for political
purposes and is so complicated that you
can't explain it to anybody
uh I would I would bet that not one of
you could meet the following challenge
get somebody to listen to Mike Ben let's
say the Tucker interview just that get
get a get a Democrat to listen to the
whole thing number one I don't think he
can do it I do not believe you could get
any Democrat to listen to the whole
thing I don't think you could do it if
you did I guarantee that they would have
cognitive dissonance so strong that they
would for get it as soon as it was
done so here here's what that would look
like so after it's done you'd say
something like all right now did you see
how he tied it all together and you know
x equals y and the person who just
watched it would say under cognitive
dissonance I didn't see
that and then you would say it's it's
like the main point no I I didn't see
that no you watched it for an hour and
it's the main point it was reinforced
100 different
times yeah I didn't see
that that's what would happen so you
actually have this weird situation where
you can't convince somebody that they're
living in a world that's different than
what they imagine the the illusion is
too strong it's really
impressive but would you like some good
news yes you would you know that Trump
recently has modified his statement that
he was running for
Revenge because when you heard that you
said oh no that's playing right into
their
hands right when you heard that didn't
you say to yourself oh don't say that
it's just going to make it easier for
them to say you're you know you're a
dictator but he has reframed that and
he's using this reframe now and he
simply calmly says this success is the
Revenge success is the
goal revenge is just the
byproduct now why is that
brilliant oh let me count the
ways number one by saying it let's say
in the provocative way to begin with
he's drawn attention to it it's the
Trump method say it wrong draw the
attention now that you have their
attention do what you need to do first
you get their attention so certainly it
made a lot of news when he reframed it
and said this success is our
revenge don't get ahead of
me damn it the the people on locals are
too well trained you're so far ahead of
me they're they're like they're like
doing my you're basically you're doing
my ACT UH 60 seconds before I do it wh
which actually I'm impressed I'm not
complaining it just means you're
smart yeah you know exactly where I'm
going all right so for those of you who
don't know exactly where I'm going let
me pull it all
together does that sound like something
that Trump came up with on his
own do you think that Trump said you
know what I'm getting a lot of push back
on this Revenge thing um it goes over
great in the rallies and I'm still in
the you know I'm still in the primary
season Maybe maybe so you can't rule out
that he just said you know I think I'll
modify this a little bit and but it
sounds exactly like
vake you hear it right that that's what
they were saying in the comments it
sounds so much like vake why because
it's
perfect because it's
perfect um you're going to ask me if I
suggested this is anybody going to ask
that because it sounds exactly like me
too it's exactly what I would have done
if I thought of it I'm not sure I would
have thought of it but if I thought of
it I would have immediately said oh this
is it yeah this is it this is what's
called a reframe if you ever heard of a
reframe yeah I wrote a whole book on it
if you want to learn how to do
this if you want to learn this
technique but also how to use it for
your own mind to reprogram yourself to
to be more effective read my book
reframe your brain it's behind me there
uh and if you're not convinced just look
at the reviews just look at the Amazon
reviews that it's all life-changing and
people are saying my God you know this
book just changed me you can see it in
the comments people are saying it in the
comments as well so yeah that's a
reframe and it's perfect and um it seems
to me that Trump is consciously lowering
the temperature because he knows he's on
a a victory um path all Trump has to do
is not
lose he's already on the victory path
just don't get off the path and the
whole uh being a little too provocative
just takes him off the path so it looks
to me like the combination of v and by
the way I let me apologize to
Trump if if this if this didn't come
from V I apologize but it looks like his
work now do I give any credit to Trump
yes because if Trump is the one who said
I got to spend some more time talking to
vake and if the if the product of that
was that he got a better reframe out of
it and then he used it that's on Trump
right you do give presidents credit for
taking good advice and for picking good
advisers if that's what happen Trump
gets the credit it doesn't matter whose
idea it is that's how it works so I
think you got to give Trump the credit
no matter whose idea it
was all right um how many of you think
it's obvious that the combination of
aake and Trump is a little bit magical
it's a little bit
magical do you know what else is magical
if you throw Elon Musk into the
mix now who do these three people remind
you of Elon Musk V RIS
Swami Donald
Trump I'll tell you what they remind me
of Elon Musk reminds me of Ben Franklin
V reminds me of Thomas
Jefferson and Trump reminds me a George
Washington you see it right George
Washington fought the impossible fight
despite incredible physical risk Trump
in possible
odds physical risk and also Financial
ruin as a risk that is some serious
George Washington
Business uh the Ben Franklin comparison
to musk I think is obvious Ben Franklin
wasn't just about inventing stuff he was
so
smart that the other people who were
Founders said um we should probably
listen to this Ben Franklin guy because
look at the other stuff he's doing if he
could do that stuff maybe we should
listen to
him so the the Ben
Franklin Elan musk comparison I think is
perfect and then Thomas Jefferson was
our in my opinion the most verbally
gifted of the
founders uh and also more of an
entrepreneur so he was an entrepreneur
you know made made the lose and a
purchase did you know bunch of smart
things uh but especially as an author
uh and V is just he just maps that
perfectly you
know
so here's what I
think I think that populism is a
losing
Vector because populism seems to be um
something that the bad guys can can turn
into a Bad
Thing here's a reframe I'd like to
suggest
it doesn't feel like a coincidence that
that three of the most prominent of the
founders of the country just
reincarnated now I don't I don't believe
in reincarnation in a literal
sense but in a political sense and in a
what is what is happening in the
simulation that we live in and code
reuse or something I mean it just feels
like it feels like the founder just re
reformed
now there's a few Founders missing and
I'll bet you can fill in the
blanks there was this uh one founder
named John Adams who some said had a
very unpleasant and contener personality
but the other thing was he was very
uncompromising especially about his Free
Speech do you know what today
is today is Independence Day
today is the day I declared my own free
speech and I gave up my entire career to
get it today is the day February 22nd so
that's the day I said I'm just going to
say whatever I think is
true and I go let the chips fall now I
didn't get canceled today the
cancellation took a few days for it to
work through the system I think the 24th
was the cancellation day I asked grock
because I couldn't
remember
but today is the
anniversary today is actually inde my
Independence Day this is when I became
completely independent and when I say
independent I mean even Republicans let
me go after
that I didn't have any friends that
day but
eventually uh we could see the pattern
do you remember who canceled me
first well the one that mattered was the
Washington Post
so let's connect some
dots so I was one of the more effective
voices uh for this thing they didn't
like this populous thing and I got
cancelled by the primarily the the
influential one was the Washington Post
which is uh rumored to be the the cia's
primary
vehicle for
propaganda so that like a coincidence do
you know how many Republicans canceled
me since then still zero not one not
even black Republicans black
conservatives not one no there was many
were
offended that's a different conversation
but no they said free speech they
actually asked me to tell me more about
them black Americans the men not not the
women so well actually the women too
yeah even Sunny Johnson invited me on so
yeah even even black women and black men
they generally said tell us more about
that that's exactly the right thing
that's what I hope for yeah tell us more
about that opinion because free speech
is our only answer the only way out is
Free Speech which we don't have at the
moment so the the black conservatives
saw that immediately whoa let's add some
free speech maybe we can get
somewhere subtracting Free Speech gets
you nowhere except where we are adding
Free Speech usually works it's usually a
good play and the black conservatives
automatically went for the smart play
because what makes them black
conservatives in the first place they're
they're keyed into what
works what makes a person
successful well being able to talk about
things honestly is right at the top and
so the the the black conservatives tend
to look at what works education staying
at a jail stay off drugs start a family
free speech and there it was they had a
philosophy that was
self-correcting they they saw an anomaly
in me whoa what's he doing that's not
good and then they said what's the
correction to that free speech and then
they tried to apply it invited me on a
number of entities that you know I got
to
talk
um however we do need a few more
Founders I would like to introduce a
term to
replace populism because populism does
look like chaos to other people if if
you like your team and the other team
says they're populist you feel like
that's a little chaotic I what's that
going to give me I don't know exactly
where that takes me with this populism
but you know what you do know you know
what the founders of the country were
about don't don't you so I think that
populism should be retired and I think
we're in a existential well we're beyond
the existential threat because the
Republic is genuinely done but we could
use a
refounding we need a
refounding you like the
founding every single person watching
this you were fans of the original
Founders or at least the concepts of
them the fact that they were slaves
slave owners this problem but you like
the idea you like the Constitution you
like the
revolution you liked the founders their
Concepts you don't have to like them as
humans but you like their
Concepts and those are the concepts
which have now been largely
destroyed by The Blob you know the
intelligence
blob but just when things were the most
dark when hope
was almost
gone you look
around and you see that the founders are
reborn and that it couldn't be more
obvious the the weird part about it is
you don't have to
stretch it's no stretch to say Elon Musk
is our bet Franklin is it is that
hyperbole not even a little bit is it a
stretch to save a vake reminds you of
Thomas Jefferson not even a little bit
no is it a mistake to say that Trump
reminds you of George Washington taking
the impossible fight impossible odds and
the personal risk which is just
insane and making it
work you see
it you see it and let me
offer that if you need somebody with a
contener unpleasant uncompromising
personality who is isn't going to settle
for not having free
speech I
volunteer now we're going to need a lot
more founder
energy and let's not focus on
individuals it would be a mistake to say
that the individuals are the story it's
really the energy and I believe that the
founders energy is somehow reemerged and
I'm just puzzled by it I mean it's one
of those things that makes you think
you're really living in some kind of a
simulation cuz how in the world how in
the world could we need the founders
energy so much and there they
are how is that a
coincidence yeah how is that a
coincidence so I would suggest to
you though while it looks
like it's the dark darkest period in
American
history and in some ways you can make
that case I would like to suggest to you
that it's always the darkest before the
dawn and ladies and gentlemen that
brings me to the end of my excellent
podcast for today I'm going to say
goodbye to YouTube and x and the rumble
platform coming to you today from the
rumble studio and I will see you
tomorrow same time same place thanks for
