what would you do with health care i'll
tell you what i do
i'd say i want health care for everyone
and we need a plan for it
because i would embrace the other side's
argument and then i would top it
i'd say we can get there and to be a
great country we should have a plan to
do it but it shouldn't be forced
it shouldn't be communism it shouldn't
be socialism we should have a plan and
that plan should be
to use um
technology and ai and maybe telehealth
and free markets and less regulations
and
basically you make an argument that you
need to get to 100 coverage
you need to
and just say we can do it better we'll
get there through free market that's how
you do things
the democrats want also want to cover
everybody but they just want to take the
money out of your pocket to do it
