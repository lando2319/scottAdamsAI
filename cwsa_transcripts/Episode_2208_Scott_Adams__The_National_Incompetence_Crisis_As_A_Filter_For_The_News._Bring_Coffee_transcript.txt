you do
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure there's nothing better to
watch right now
nothing but if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels that nobody can
even conceive well all you need for that
is a cup of mug or a glass of tanker
Chelsea Steiner canteen Jugger flask of
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now of the unparalleled pleasure of
the dopamine to the day the thing that
makes everybody everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip it happens
to outgo
let me get rid of somebody over here on
YouTube
we're already
but new in timeout goodbye
already bad behavior my God
well I'm going to start out with a
prediction
prediction
remember this one so you can embarrass
me later when I'm so terribly wrong
about it okay here's the prediction
in two years
maybe sooner the news will be reporting
that AI was less impressive than any of
us thought it would be
anybody want to take the other side of
that in two years the news will say you
know we thought this would be a much
sort of a bigger deal
it'll still be everywhere it will be
ubiquitous
but we're going to see it as just a new
tool
it will not change civilization
it will not fundamentally alter our
employment rate
and you won't use it that much
because it's too hard to use
all they did is find a new way to show
us something we can't do
if you can't do complicated super props
you can't do much with it
and you can't do complicated super
problems
so it's sort of like saying you know
what you know what would be great you
could build your own website
start a Commerce store make yourself a
millionaire
I don't know how to do that I do not
know how to program my own Commerce site
I would have to hire somebody to do that
just like AI
do you think someday you're going to be
able to build yourself an entire
Commerce site or anything do you think
anybody's ever built a uh a website
without knowing how to build a website
do you think that's happened even once
nope
nope oh you think so
you think that somebody just said hey AI
uh go get me a domain
and sign up for it and then program this
thing
and then it was just up and running
there's no way that happened
now there's no way that happened
I do not believe it I believe that those
people who knew how to do it would know
exactly what to use and what to ask for
but nobody else would
there's no non-technical person who
built a functioning website with AI I do
not believe that
all right so two years from now we're
gonna say well it wasn't that big of a
deal
update still still waiting for approvals
from Amazon for my new Blockbusters
instant classic the book that's sweeping
the country it actually is it's actually
going to be a really big deal uh you
don't know how big it is until it starts
getting out there but what's going to
happen is that the reframes in the book
it's already starting to happen
people are already reporting
amazing benefits and when they report
that then then the book starts marketing
itself
but we should have the audio book as
well as the soft cover and the hour now
really they're both submitted we're just
waiting for Amazon to say yes or to say
there's something else we need to do
but uh we'll get that done
all right let's talk about the uh Joe
Biden visiting Maui
wow
uh by now you probably all know that
that didn't go as well as they'd hoped
wow talk about blowing your opportunity
so I saw at least two videos of Biden
being chanted at with the F Biden chant
uh one was his motorcade and another was
when he was some group
and I'm thinking to myself
they know this is the bluest state in
the world right isn't it the most
Democrat state
of all the states
am I wrong about that I think it's
number one right of all the states it's
the most democratic state
and then two places there were crowds
willing to chant him down with f Joe
Biden
now if if I had said to you well there's
no way that Hawaii would ever turn
Republican
you would have laughed and it doesn't
look like it's going to happen I mean
you know people don't change that easily
but it's actually within the realm of
possibility
now if the candidate is Trump Hawaii
will go just the way it always goes I
think you'd agree right if it's Trump
they're just going to say Trump
and they'll just have a you know
anaphylactic response so if it's Trump
the Hawaii will vote you know all
Democrat like always
but what if it's for the fake
do you remember what vivek's main theme
is
competence
competence simple competence picking
people who are qualified promoting
people who are qualified and not using
other considerations to get in the way
of competence
if the vague comes in and says
if I were president Hawaii might have
looked different
and then he explains what things he
would do to make it into more you know
more capable situation
I don't know
you might have a shot
he might have a shot I mean a long long
long shot long long long long long shot
but it's actually in play
in my opinion Hawaii's in play but only
under the only under the specific you
know Vivek is the candidate and he may
he makes an argument for capability over
politics
if you're a Hawaiian right now mountains
especially Maui and a politician said to
you look let's drop the politics we need
to focus on making work
how would you hear that
forget the politics we just can make
stuff work things don't work
let's fix fix that first
that would be a strong strong package
probably not strong enough but
interesting to think about anyway so
Biden's in Maui and he gave the
cringiest worst
empathy speech of all time
let me start with an analogy
um did you ever have anybody say yeah
hey let me show you pictures of my new
baby
and you're like oh great I guess you'd
have to act pretty excited because
babies all look alike but I'm going to
pretend this is the best one ever
yeah yeah now they all look like Winston
Churchill uh crossed with uh
who's that Little Star Wars character I
forget but anyway
who's the Star Wars character who talks
backwards
Yoda Yoda
um
um so if somebody says look at a picture
of my baby here's what you don't say oh
that's babies great
um here's a picture of my dog
what yeah don't do that don't do that
here's another one you shouldn't do
these are just lessons for later
somebody says to you oh my god I I have
cancer I've got six months to live and
you say oh that's terrible that's
terrible you know I've got this bunion
on my left foot
and that's that's driving me crazy too
no no no no don't compare anybody's baby
to your pet no don't do that don't do
that don't prepare anybody's cancer to
your bunion no no
no bunions to cancer
basic stuff this is basic stuff people
and if there is a potentially the worst
tragedy in American history that's
probably not true but it's really bad
why you should not compare it to is that
kitchen fire you had that one time
that was put out in 20 minutes
don't don't do that
if uh if there's a potential massive
loss of life which include way too many
children we don't know the details yet
do not laughingly say your Corvette was
at risk for the tiny kitchen fire
all right am I making my point here
there are some things you just don't
compare
let me give you another one
my grandmother was in the Holocaust
my grandmother had to use a butter churn
to make butter they didn't even they
couldn't even buy butter
no no do not do not do that do not
Butter Churn Holocaust no no don't
compare so that's my lesson for the day
you know
I just laughed at it all well what was
your response to the Little Joe Biden
Fiasco
did did you get angry
does anybody feel angry
aren't we Way Beyond it it just it
literally played like humor like we've
gotten to the point where we no longer
pretend he's capable now you just send
him out to see what he does
you teared up
really
disgust
I can't even get to discussed
see the the problem is he no longer
registers as a capable adult
are you not there yet
I mean I do see him as a dementia
patient and and I can't get mad at a
dementia patient
can I get mad at the people who send
them out there
I get get mad at them
yeah am I mad at the people who put him
in front of Maui yeah I'm really
mad at them
that was
completely unacceptable
you know he should be out of office you
know he needs to step back but you got
yourself a problem don't you then
instead of him getting him a vice
president who has some capability you
went full Dei and you got yourself
somebody who can't do the job and now
you're stuck
all right Joe Biden he's he's just a
dementia patient I actually have empathy
for him
right he's done some some stuff I don't
like
but I'm not really thinking about that
when I see him I just think I just think
somebody needs to help you
somebody needs to be the adult in the
room and make that stop
can we agree this is the last straw
can we just call this celestra
because somebody's just got to call it
we have to call it as done and I don't
believe that the news should be covering
him as a president he should be covered
as a dementia patient from now on we we
need to just close that door let's stop
 pretending he's a capable adult
everybody can see it now everybody can
see it right and and politics is
separate like let's argue our politics
over here
but let's agree
that we need to treat him with a little
bit of dignity how about
right like he's he's not my political
friend right he's not on my side for a
lot of stuff but when you reach that
point you need a little dignity
and he can't give it to himself
right it's going to have to come from
the people around him and it's time
you all see it let Maui be the time when
the news finally wakes up treats the
rest of us like we can see with our own
 eyes that he's gone
it's time
you know you know maybe they need to
keep him in there as a zombie president
for some political reason but we do not
have an obligation to treat him like
he's an actual functioning adult
forget politics he's not a functioning
adult and we all see it
so I don't even know if I can talk about
it like a president anymore he's a
patient
he's a victim he is he's a victim of
elder abuse at this point
is is elder abuse too too far do you
think that he wanted his legacy to
include the Maui visit do you think the
Biden museum is going to put
that video up there for everybody to
watch no doesn't help his legacy doesn't
help his presidency doesn't help
Maui at all
and you're making a mockery of the
 country
you're making a mockery of it so at
least the people on the right leaning
news can you grow the up and stop
treating him like he's a functioning
adult we can all see he's not
stop pretending stop calling him the
president he barely knows he is
and again
I'd say I tell you exactly the same
thing if this would Trump if Trump
turned into a bubble you know bumbling
 of this nature I mean you forget
about forget about your opinion of him
at the moment but if he turned into that
I'd be saying the same thing
you think if Ivanka and Jared pushed uh
or melodia but she's not The Pusher if
somebody pushed him out there to like
act like that
you think I wouldn't be mad at Trump's
family
I'd be pretty pissed I'd be really
pissed if his family treated him like
that
so this is not even political this is
absolutely human and as a human I um
I can't respect this I just can't
respect Jill Biden
Jill Biden I I don't have respect for it
right now she needs to do the wife thing
you know the the politics thing is done
let's call it done
you need to be the wife
you're not doing it you're not setting
an example for the rest of us
and we notice all right
well at least his Corvette survived
um
I'm going to make a big thing of this so
this will be the theme of my uh my show
today the theme will be the national
incompetence crisis
you're all experiencing right when I say
it you go oh my God true you cannot do
simple transactions in society in 2023.
there is nothing that's easy enough that
works
you can't rent a car buy a car go
shopping for groceries fill your tank
get car service you can't call a plumber
you can't get anything done
people don't return calls they don't
show up they don't know how to do the
job I've never seen anything like this
it's not me right you're all seeing it
now I think it does seem to me
that it would be going too far
to say that you know this is a Dei
kind of too much hiring without looking
at qualifications it's probably one of
the variables is probably one of the
variables but there's something else
going on
and I don't know exactly what it is but
let me speculate
speculation number one
have you ever seen a 16 year old today
and then you remember what 16 year olds
were like when let's say some of the
older people watching were kids
at 60 and kids were running businesses
like actually running entire businesses
I have a few examples in my head
right
running entire businesses
small businesses but businesses
now
think about the things that you would
have been trusted with when you were a
teenager
think about it the things you would have
been trusted to do as a teenager and now
compare that to what you would trust a
teenager to do today
it's really different
so part of it is I think kids are let's
say living in let's say a bubble of
sheltered kind of experience
so that unless you need them to show you
how to hook up a video game you know a
lot of their talents are not translating
into the real world so I think in the
old days
children were integrated into the Adult
World earlier and more extreme
yes or no
kids were integrated into the Adult
World sooner
and so I think what you have is maybe
everybody's five years behind what they
should be I almost say should the five
years behind what they might have been
in a previous generation so some of it
is just lack of exposure to the real
world
right lack of solving your own problems
some of it is that the school system
might be worse I don't know
so there's a number of things going on
but I would say if I had to point to one
thing that's making us a incompetent
country
um well two things number one our
employment rate is very good
which is really bad news for competence
you know what I mean do you get that
immediately
our our employment rate is pretty dear
full employment
you know in in an economic sense not in
a number sense in economic sense when
you get around three four percent
unemployment
that's considered fully employed
because you need a little three four
percent slop so that if you need to hire
somebody there's somebody available who
might be you know good enough to hire
once you reach a point where all the
good people have jobs
what happens to the next company that
needs to hire somebody
they lower their standards because they
they just know they need a body in that
job
so it seems to me that high employment
is poisoned
at some point
at some point everybody's operating
below the capability level whereas if
you had enough people to pick from you
know the best companies could have
really good teams and it's the best
companies that make the biggest
difference right
so we might have a too much employment
problem
weirdly it's a it's a weird backwards
problem
but the other problem that I think
you'll agree with this one completely
everything's too complicated
in other words every time you add any
complication to a system it's odds of
breaking go up you know like double
now you've seen me complain about it but
it looked like I was just bitching when
I do my live stream
that if I add one thing to it just any
one thing the odds of failure reach 100
every change
takes the odds of failure to nearly 100
so for example if I added to this
morning process that I would do you know
one extra light or something
it for three days the show would be a
mess because I wouldn't remember to do
it or doing that would make me forget
something else
the the number of things you have to do
just to let me take any example let's
say I need
um
I need to get some prescription meds all
right so I take an anti-acid
prescription meds so what would you
think would be the process for getting
some medicine that's not very important
you know anti-acid it's not a big deal
and and I take it all the time
what what should that process look like
well I'll tell you it should look like
when I need some
I go to some app and I you know say hey
I need this again and then it shows up
the next day like any Amazon product
right Amazon's pretty much next day
delivery
that's not what happens
instead if I want to deliver it it'll
take a week but they can't guarantee it
do you think that I'm I plan I do you
think I put it on my calendar when I
need to redo my medicine no because I
would be an extra complication
I just when it looks like it's about
done you know I hold the thing like oh
not too many left there I better order
some some new
so now I go I try to do it online but
they don't give me an option to get it
in time
so now I have to go to look at all the
other options of there's the special
delivery
and like okay that but that only applies
to new new prescriptions all right and
then there's a regular delivery but I
could sign up for I think the special
one where they take it to the parking
lot or the one where you stand in line
and then you know after all these
complications and decisions I order it
and then I wait for the notification to
come on my phone that is ready to go get
it
but the notification never came
but that's okay because I couldn't get
it because my car was in the shop and
they wouldn't call me back in fact after
four calls and no return call about my
car I was on the verge of reporting is
stolen by the BMW dealership not a joke
not a joke I mean I probably wouldn't
have done it but I was on the verge of
calling the police and say look
there's somebody else by car they're not
responding could you give them a call
see if you can release it
that actually was happening that
literally actually now so
so I never get I never get the text
so I don't know if it's ready
and I never had my car so I couldn't get
it but that's okay because I can take an
Uber
so I signed up to get an Uber stand in
the corner
no Ubers
Uber wasn't working that day now the app
was working but nobody nobody was
picking up my my ride
so I changed all of my plans because
taking an Uber across town is an all-day
thing
yeah by the time you wait for it by the
time the Uber goes to the wrong place by
the time the Uber accepts and then it
cancels before it shows up it cancels on
you you've all had this right
so so I give up on the Uber but that's
okay because when I ordered the meds it
didn't work for some reason I don't know
why
so I didn't order the meds that I
thought I'd ordered I didn't have a car
to drive it there and I couldn't get an
Uber because every thing stopped
working
everything stopped working
but that's okay because I had a lot of
work to do you know self-published well
not a self but independently publishing
do you know how many things went wrong
trying to sign up for various websites
to do different parts of the independent
publishing part
let me tell you what wrong almost
everything
almost every part of it was broken and
needed some kind of fix or you know
pivot or work around or maybe there's
another service that does it instead
everything
do you know most of the time I tried to
prove that I am the Dilbert guy
do you know how hard that is
I got yeah I'm saying I'm a public
figure I'm the easiest person to
identify in the world you can Google me
I'll go on Zoom I'll show you a picture
of my passport I can prove who I am a
thousand different ways do you know what
way they required
the only way that they would accept is
if my email address had a business a
business address
like I I had to be you know Scott Adams
at some some company.com and I only have
my own address I didn't have a business
address I had to hire a lawyer
to create a business address
just just to deal with them to get that
done
you know one of the one of the things
twice I ran into that now
these are just my little problems so you
shouldn't care about my little problems
I'm using this only as an example of
your life
when I when I describe my experience
this past few days how many of you said
oh my God that's
I'm there I can't get anything done
every service doesn't work everything
it's all broken
yeah
the I tell you Vivek isn't exactly the
right place because the the vague take
is that we need to focus on capability
and competence again and we're really
not
I just don't see people going to work
saying yeah I'm going to do this right
you know I'm really going to add the
skills I'm really going to make
it just feels like we've given up on
trying to do good work
anyway let's talk about some examples of
that as we go uh first of all apparently
the there's at least one cartel in
Mexico that has created an elite drone
attack group
that's right the cartels are creating an
Air Force
that's not a joke people as Biden likes
to say not a joke they're creating an
elite unit that's been training for a
long time and they're buying uh they're
buying suicide drones that they can
control sometimes for many miles away so
they they have them searching for their
rival cartels and then when they find
them they they crash it and it blows up
and kills them
so do you think we should hurry to try
to get a military grip on the cartel
situation or should we just wait until
they have f-16s of Their Own
because I feel like I feel like this
would be the time to you know maybe take
care of that
so again Republicans are talking about
going in and taking care of it
Democrats or not so Democrats if you
want the cartel to have an Air Force
just keep doing nothing
all right uh there's a uh Washington
Post is reporting there's a new study
saying that long covet lasts two years
at least is reported in the Washington
Post which is not a credible Outlet uh
and they're talking about a scientific
study and it's 2023 so there's no such
thing as credible scientific studies in
2023. so this is a double non-credible a
non-credible news reporting Source The
Washington Post and a non-credible
scientific study because they're all
non-credible
at best it's a coin flip at best
um
so that's all I have to believe about
that I don't believe any covert related
data I don't believe anything about
vaccination harm or anything about
vaccination benefit or anything about
coveted harm or anything about loan
covet
my current opinion is there's nothing
that I could believe
I have no idea what happened no idea I
really don't that this is not hyperbole
I don't have any idea what happened for
the last three years
does anybody have that same feeling
I don't know what happened
I I think masks are easy maths didn't
work
that's the whole story
um
yeah it's very disconcerting to not know
what I went through for three years
um let's talk about Vivek once again I
wake up and I look at the trending part
of Twitter that I call X
and how often now I can't tell is the
trending part different for different
users
does everybody get the same trending
because that's sort of what it's for
right everybody should see the same one
so if for those of you who use x
are you seeing Vivek Trend basically
every time or is that because of the way
I use x
so are you seeing him Trend basically
every day or no
because I am
it's different why why would trending be
different for all of us I believe you
that it is but why would it be different
for all of us
so it's trending things I think you're
you'd want to see
because it should be trending whether
you like it or not right
I don't get that
but anyway at least for me I get a lot
of news from him and he makes news every
single day and here it is again
um so Caitlin Collins of CNN was
interviewing him and uh they wanted to
they wanted to paint him as a conspiracy
theorist
so they they came at it with a
pre-obviously this is not mind reading
because it's so obvious they came with a
predetermined uh frame they were trying
to put on him
because if it's stuck then everything
else they can stick to it and the frame
was that he's a conspiracy theory
believer
there's zero evidence of that
not anywhere there's no evidence he's
ever believed anything except facts that
are in in evidence
so there's a story and I guess it was
the Atlantic which grossly misquoted him
he says he asked for the audio tape and
they couldn't get one surprise they
wouldn't give him the audio tape but he
clearly didn't say it with the Atlantic
said so CNN watch how they work together
so the Atlantic which I would consider
the maybe among the least credible just
obvious lie kind of publication
so they go first and they tell like a
really gross lie they they misquote him
just terribly
and then that allows CNN to use the
misquote lie as a basis for asking him
you know what do you what do you say to
this story
now he starts by saying oh I didn't say
that that's a misquote I asked him for
the audio they wouldn't give it to me so
yeah no I don't believe that never said
it nothing like that
so at that point don't you think the
interview should be over or at least
that part of the interview
but no
apparently Caitlyn Collins had decided
that she was going to push this thing
and I I won't play it for you but I'll
summarize it so I tweeted a summary now
none of the words in my summary or
anything that they said
these are my own words but if you want
to get a feel for how it went my words
will give you the feel kind of quickly
all right here's CNN it's Caitlin
Collins again these are my words not
theirs so why do you say 911 was an
inside job so that's the thing they were
trying to tarab with they're trying to
make him look like he's saying 911 was
an inside job
and I'm not saying it was or wasn't but
he's not saying that so CNN says why do
you say 911 was an inside job Vivek I've
never said that oh yeah here's a video
of you not saying it
this actually happened this sounds like
I'm making it up right
so to prove that he really did say that
9 11 was an inside job they showed a
video of him talking in which he said
nothing like that
nothing even sort of like that at all
so she shows the video and she says well
and then she says oh yeah here's a video
of you not saying it then she shows a
video of him not saying it
and then then she says basically what do
you have to say for yourself now like
how do you explain that
and he's sitting there thinking what
what am I experiencing here you just
showed a video in which I didn't say the
thing you said I said and now you're
asking me to explain the video you just
showed that showed your line
and he's basically just laughing at her
at that point like you know at that
point he's just destroyed her and watch
her face
she she starts going into the cognitive
dissonance phase where she knows she's
 or maybe she doesn't and maybe
maybe she's trying to make sense of her
world but she went into this trying hard
to embarrass him you know with the I'm
going to drop this bomb and then we'll
end the interview and you can't defend
yourself and he just tore her apart
tore her apart
um
anyway and toward the end you put a
cherry on top he says this feels like
the way you treated another candidate
you didn't mention Trump but he just
laughed at him like this this sounds
like the way you treated that other guy
just making up basically again
these are all my words
but so I watched this thing
and I could watch I could watch that for
eight years
give me eight years of a vague going on
every left-leading thing and tearing
their fake news apart right in front of
them
I didn't think there was anybody in the
Republican Party who could even do it
because you know who else can't do that
Trump
is terrible
at defending uh against fake news I've
never seen Trump once do a good job of
Defending against all the hoaxes
but vivek's not going to roll over he's
not going to roll over if they say you
said something or did something he
didn't do
if a fake had been accused of saying
drink bleach you know which Trump also
did not say
he he would have eviscerated them for
saying that in public
Trump just kind of said oh I was joking
and he let let it live that was a total
mistake total mistake so the fact that
there could be a republican candidate
who would eviscerate fake news while you
watch
that could be everything
because the the public still thinks the
news is real
right at least half of the public still
thinks news is real we haven't had real
news
in a long time at least on politics but
I don't know if we ever have
so after this total debacle in which CNN
is just humiliated
uh do you think that the people on the
left sought the same way I did
do you think my my interpretation of the
CNN being humiliated in on live TV do
you think that's what they saw
or is it possible
cognitive dissonance that either I'm
insane and you can check for yourself I
suppose see if I'm the one in cognitive
dissonance or would it be Mary Hassan
um who said he he plays the video or
actually he retweeted vivek's
tweet about the interview because Vivek
was so happy about it he wanted to
retweet it because he did so well and
then mehdi Hassan who's very associated
with the left
uh he tweets it and then he says many
says but the question was is 9 11 an
inside job and you didn't say no
now if you didn't see the interview and
most people are not going to click on it
wouldn't you say that that's a pretty
good point
there's somebody that that she made a
direct accusation ask him a direct
question and he didn't answer it wow
except
he answered it directly
directly
because she she pointed out that he
wasn't answering it directly because he
had instead spent time eviscerating her
fake news
so when he was done eviscerating all of
her fake news
because he'd never even talked about the
con he'd never even been on the topic
he said just hold this in your head he
had never even spoken
in the other way about the topic of it
being an inside job
so he talked about how nothing like that
happened in the real world
and then she gets him with but you
didn't deny it
he did not deny it he'd never even
talked about it it was
I mean it just wasn't even a topic so
then realizing that you know she's got
this little gotcha that like ah you're
not denying it you're not denying it he
denies it directly and in clear words
and then Hassan tweets but she didn't
deny it now he denied it directly
directly and with clear clean words with
no ambiguity whatsoever
but you wouldn't know that if you just
read the tweet
so when you when you see him Force
his let's say political opponents into
just a ridiculous box
you don't want to see that for eight
years
or do you want to just see people tell
you that you're a Nazi because you
support Trump
it's really clean it's a really I hate
to say it because I I love Trump
you know a lot about him
you know he's the OG you could only have
a fake if there's been a trump in my
opinion so I mean Trump gets a lot of
credit from me but he is far from a
perfect candidate
we all agree right he can't do this
he can't do this he can say fake news
fake news and it does work I mean he did
convince half the country that the news
is fake and he was right about it uh and
I do still like you know Trump's
policies generally he seems to be he
seems to promote policies for the most
part that make complete sense
as does Vivek
but Vivek can do this
yeah I I always think of the Avengers
you know when I think of the Republican
party I think actually even makes
something like this but you think of the
Avengers there's there's a famous line
in whichever Avengers it was you'll tell
me probably do you remember when they
said uh we have a Hulk it was like one
of the funny lines in the series but we
have a Hulk
that's what I think whatever whatever
Vivek is on TV
because Vivek is the Hulk
like he's the one they don't want to
talk to
do you know how much they don't want to
talk to Vivek you know they have to
because he's too important so he's
impossible to ignore which he did
himself he made himself impossible to
ignore
but yeah it's totally of a vague smash
the vague smash that's what it feels
like anyway I'm lucky to provide more
every day if you couldn't tell
uh I'll say it again we need a some kind
of a TV show with high production
qualities which is important just going
through all the hoaxes that the media
has presented now they could do both you
know left leaning hoaxes and
right-leaning hoaxes but man do we need
that we just need to be the The hoax
show all right the political Oak show
then you could take Clips out of it and
every time you're on social media and
somebody says one of those hoaxes you
just play that clip
how useful would that be
but I don't know I just needs somebody
to make that
all right um
here's another theme I'm going to see
how long I can push this
the the negative comments about Vivek
from Republicans
have a certain quality to them that in
my opinion
or a racist dog whistle
and I have mocked this whole racist dog
whistle thing forever it's like that's
not a racist dog whistle it's just a
fact about immigration for example
but I gave you some examples yesterday
but here's another comment somebody made
about Vivek it doesn't matter who was
just a Critic
says that Vivek is over polished like
Obama
that's the criticism he's over polished
like Obama
how does that sound to you
am I am I am I being too woke
you tell me am I being too woke
or is that obviously
you can feel a little whistle there
can't you
like I feel I can feel it
but I'm not a mind reader so I don't
know what's in the mind of the person
who tweeted it but watch keep an eye on
this all right keep an eye on this
because there's a whole bunch of people
who don't want to say I'm uncomfortable
because he's brown
but you know they exist right you know
they exist
so just keep an eye on that
I don't know if it's a thing yet but uh
it's anecdotally it's kind of bothersome
um
Tucker Carlson had Colonel Douglas
McGregor on uh to tell us that
everything the media is telling us is a
lie that Russia is actually strong and
winning and Ukraine is actually weaker
than we think and losing they're running
out of people and we're going to end up
with Americans fighting Russians if we
keep on this path
does that sound to you persuasive
incredible
plausible
oh little troll
who says only Scott is virtuous White
you're in your own little world and I'm
gonna make sure you're not in ours
anymore goodbye
go back to your little world
all right
so here's my take on the colonel Douglas
McGregor who I've heard before saying
similar things but he got a bigger
platform for this
um how does he know
how's that I was that one guy now
he's the only guy who has the right
information
is he in Ukraine
does he have secret sources
yeah now I'm not saying he's wrong
right so I'm not offering a criticism of
his opinion it could be right on I don't
I don't really no because I'm not in
Ukraine
I don't have any sources and I wouldn't
trust any sources I had
do you think there's anybody in Ukraine
anybody
or anybody in Russia anybody who is
telling you an honest and honest opinion
of what's Happening as opposed to a spin
now if you talk to individual soldiers
they're only saying they're a little
part of the war
so if they say in my little part of the
war we're losing
doesn't really tell you much
my little part of the war is all
incompetent maybe it is doesn't really
tell you that much right so you can't
get news from individuals who are
fighting
I don't think that would be Dependable
at all they would only know their little
corner
you can't get news from the government
because they would all lie you know
Ukraine and Russia you can't get news
from the news because the news is
basically not allowed in
so where is he getting his information
why is this information better than your
information
do you do you think he has sources that
are the good ones and nobody nobody else
has figured out who his good sources are
what was he not telling you
he's got all the good sources but he's
not a sheriff is that happening isn't
there something terribly suspicious
about this whole thing
right
how in the world could he be so
confident of his opinion
which is very favorable to Russia
now I'm not I'm not making any kind of
accusation that sounded like I was so
the the the overall statement is you
can't believe anybody about Russia or
Ukraine
the the fact that somebody is a notable
military analyst that doesn't mean
anything
it literally means nothing it's 20 23.
all news about wars is fake
so if he's got a secret source
Maybe
if he's just smart enough to you know
read the read the situation that kind of
knows what's fake and what isn't because
of experience maybe yeah it's entirely
possible that his his filter of just
being experienced is actually seeing
this perfectly accurately so I'm not
going to rule out the I won't rule out
that he's perfectly on point
I will only say why would you believe it
like why would you believe that
even if he's right why would you believe
it
there's no there's no signal for
credibility
you say well he doesn't have a history
of lying nope not good enough that
doesn't mean you know about the
unknowable
uh he's he's a military guy respected
colonel
doesn't mean a thing
if he doesn't have the information he
doesn't have the information and why
does he have better information
so
he might be entirely right so I'm not
saying he's wrong I'm just saying that
if you believe it because he he has the
position of somebody who might know what
he's talking about
that's not good enough anymore it's just
not good enough if he if he showed
sources that you could check then that
would be very good
but if he's just opinionating about
who's stronger or weaker or where it's
going to go has anybody ever been able
to predict something like this
you know this is a little a little bit
like covid
the Ukrainian situation will either go
you know more for Ukraine or more for
Russia eventually
right at some point history will say
well one of them chose correctly and one
of them didn't probably
and then half of the people who were on
that side but they were just guessing
because nobody had good information are
going to say I knew it I told you all
along
because that's the way this works if
it's a binary you'll always have people
who said I told you
whenever there's a yes it'll happen or
no it won't
the people who get lucky are pretty sure
it's skill and that will never change
and if you if you suggest to them you
know it was a 50 50 right so whichever
way this went
half of the country was going to say
they were geniuses
there's no way around that
half will say they were geniuses
well all right enough about that
all right
um
do you think that the Ukraine is going
to run out of people and uh will the U.S
Americans will be on the front let me
say this
as clearly as I possibly can
if America decided to go directly
against Russia
as an American soldiers shooting at and
being shot at by Russians that's Civil
War time
you might as well just say Russia won
because we're going to go after
our own country if they do that right if
my government starts a war on
the ground or even in the air I suppose
with Russia we're done with our
government we have to get rid of them
right away
so let me say it as clearly as possible
January 6 I don't I don't think that was
a nothing I think that was a protest but
if you want an actual Revolution start
me a war with Russia and I'm
going to be armed and in the capital
right that's a red line we're not going
to go to war with Russia
because the citizens we will revolt and
we will do it violently
let me just say it directly
war with Russia is a violent revolution
in America and
I'll sign up first
we'll be armed and driving to the
Capitol we're not going to do that we're
not going to go to war with Russia
all right
there's your clip for the day
all right um what else we got um
I have a observation for you that's
going to blow your mind I think a little
bit I tried this out in the man cave
last night so you guys some of you have
seen this but on Bill Marshall Club
random where he has you know a little
smoking and drinking and uh casual
conversation with a variety of people he
had the fake so Bill Maher was talking
to Vivek and it was fascinating I really
recommend it I mean it's hard to watch
the partying part of it because it's
just a little uncomfortable frankly but
yeah I'm guilty of it myself but um
you have to watch it and here's what's
interesting
um Bill Maher clearly respects vivek's
intellect that comes through very very
clearly he also seems very confused
wife of a fake could believe some of the
things he believes
but it's also clear to let's say an
observer who knows what the hoaxes are
that bill is in a TDS still believing
hoaxes he still believes that that there
was no
that there was not a peaceful transfer
of power in in 2020 or that there was a
risk of no transfer of power that that
the January 6th stuff uh was a risk to
the peaceful transfer of power now I
consider that a form of mental illness a
temporary you know TDS something you
could recover from but to me that looks
like mental illness
because how in the world do you connect
the dots from somebody doing some
paperwork over a a alternate set of
electors which apparently has happened
in the past the worst case scenario is
it would end up in the courts
like as before and then the court would
say hey these electors are either
valid in which case everything was fine
or they're invalid in which case it's
reversed
we were never in trouble because the
paperwork is the paperwork we have a
bureaucracy that takes care of this
stuff you make crazy claims and then the
course says oh that's a crazy claim get
out of here
so we were never we were never even in
the domain of a of a non-peaceful
transfer there was a question which way
it would transfer to
but that would be settled by courts with
no bullets or anything and we would have
all pretty much accepted it especially
if a conservative Court said get out of
here with your claims
so but anyway that's not what I was
going to talk about the uh
um
there was a lot of interrupting
so uh when they would talk neither of
them are ones who back down
so they're both uh I would say they're
both highly capable and I don't want to
say aggressive I'll say assertive so
they're both very assertive verbally
so you put two assertive verbally people
together and they they end up talking
over each other and interrupting
continuously
and I've made this observation before
that I've done a lot of media interviews
and a lot of them with people who didn't
agree with me
I don't get interrupted
and I've been trying to figure out why
and he was getting interrupted like
crazy and I feel like if I'd been in
that same interview I wouldn't have been
interrupted and I'm trying to figure out
why there wasn't I finally had an
insight
and it goes like this
if you don't acknowledge the point of
the other person they're going to
interrupt you until you do
and it's your own fault
right if you don't acknowledge what
somebody said and you just talked about
something else they will interrupt you
and you deserve it
the reason I don't get interrupted is
I'm very fastidious about making sure
that the person who made a point I don't
agree with I I speak it back
okay well what you're saying is this
once once they know that you heard them
they can now listen to what you have to
say and they'll also trust that when
you're done saying what you say you'll
give them space to say what they say
especially if you model that once or
twice
so here's a
suggestion to Vivek
he was in a very casual conversation
situation but he never left campaign
mode
campaign mode as you say somebody says
what do you think about X but your
answer is something about why
and he kept doing that now as much as I
love Vivek and he's you know you just
intellectually gifted and communication
better than anything we've seen he does
have one problem with his communication
he does not repeat back what the other
side said or acknowledge it in full
so that then they can listen to him
he does a great job of talking over and
getting his point through anyway so he's
got he's got sort of a a trumpian you
know energy monster kind of thing so if
a fake is good with energy so he uses
his energy
to at least make his side think he won
conversations
right so the talking over is part of a
dominance Alpha kind of thing and you
definitely pick up on that he definitely
looks dominant he definitely looks Alpha
when he's doing the talking through and
talking interrupting but and you can you
can go a long way with that people do
respond to that the acts of dominance as
long as it's not obnoxious
but he could go to the next level
he just has to say all right Bill what
you're saying is that you believe you
know this
and your Source was probably that
but let me tell you another source
perhaps you haven't seen
now people will listen to that
that's why I don't get interrupted it's
just basic
persuasion strategy that if you don't
let the other person say their whole
thing the whole thing the way they want
to say it and then acknowledge it back
to them you can't get anywhere
the there's no point in having the
conversation
yeah
so I would say if you if you feel
yourself getting interrupted the
question you should ask is are you doing
your part
so the the great the the AHA here is
that the getting interrupted is
something you bring on yourself
so think about it next time you're
watching if you watch this one you
really see it so watch the club random
with Vivek and Bill Maher and watch
watch How often that's true the Vex
answers were great he just wasn't
acknowledging what bill was saying all
the time that that cost them I think
well you know it's not enough to repeat
what they said
sometimes you have to actually
accentuate it
so for example if somebody said you know
blah blah you know somebody lied
instead of just you know talking about
something else
it's way more it's way stronger to say
you know all the politicians are lying
yeah that probably is a lie now blah
blah blah so
good example
all right
uh
yeah you have to acknowledge their
thought
ladies and gentlemen I don't have much
else to say is there a topic I missed I
got a late start today
I want to make sure I didn't miss
anything
it works except when you're talking to a
narcissist
um
I disagree
I actually think it would work with a
narcissist I I get that that's the
highest degree of difficulty but I think
it actually would work because the
narcissist wants you to acknowledge
their point
I think it does work
in fact with a narcissist I would even
take a little further I would say you
know that's a that's an insult
insightful point and I don't think
everybody is paying enough attention to
it
and then you give your your debunk
um oh Hawaiians become Republicans yeah
I don't I don't think it's going to
happen but uh the windows open
all right
did you talk about Nick Fuentes no is he
making some news
I didn't say any news about him
uh Ronan Farrow did a head job on Elon
oh my God
oh my God
seriously
wow wow
you know how does that strike you
do you think with what the country
really needs is a hit job on Elon Musk
is that what we need right now
yeah Ronan Farrow has done apparently
great work in the past so you know we
can respect his work but
is that what we need is a country better
off for that
wow
all right that's all I have to say about
that
um
yeah
restrictions so Alex Jones says there's
restrictions here's what I think
I think that there are definitely
bureaucrats talking about restrictions
definitely people in the medical
community and the reason is cognitive
dissonance
if you were a medical professional who
had been pushing you know mandates and
mass and stuff and at the end you found
out you were wrong about everything
your cognitive dissonance probably
kicked in and told you you were right
about everything you better do it again
so I understand why people would talk
about it here's what I don't think would
happen I don't think you can pass the
political filter
so this is why I'm not worried about the
restrictions coming back I believe that
at this point you could get a hundred
percent of the medical community to say
any you want because they seem
to be all you know it's 99 cowards in
the medical and uh
science professions and when I say
cowards
that's probably unkind because they
actually would lose their jobs
I guess it's easy for me to say because
I already got canceled
so yeah I'm one of the few people who
can say well maybe you should say what
you're thinking even at the risk of your
career because I literally did that but
it's not really reasonable to expect
people trying to pay the bills and feed
their family and you know help the
public with their medical
experience it's not really you can't
really ask them to risk their lives
but the politicians are subject to the
voters opinions and if the Democrats
started pushing restrictions with a
presidential race coming up you tell me
the odds of that happening go you tell
me the odds that the Democrats for a
purely political perspective would allow
mandates in the context of a
presidential race
no
no way the first time maybe because the
first time was you know fooled me once
territory we're we're squarely and
fooled me twice territory
once you get to fool me twice territory
you've got a political problem that
you're not going to solve
so if you're worried about the mandates
I mean I suppose we should be a little
worried but there's no way that passes
the political filter and yeah I can't
even imagine
it's unimaginable at this point it would
be political suicide and we and the
Republicans wouldn't need to talk about
anything else
Republican Republican could just say I
know you don't like all of my policies
but I'll get rid of your masks
you got my vote
all right
uh RNC debate is coming up I forgot to
talk about this uh Larry Elder has been
blocked out of the uh RNC debates
for the weirdest reason
uh one of the requirements to qualify
was that you had to show a certain
performance in at least one major poll
he submitted his performance in the
erasmussen poll and they rejected it
because the Rasmussen poll they say has
too much of a trump
connection or flavor or influence or
whatever
now don't you think it's a good argument
to say that they've had some of the best
polling on the presidential races
it which Larry did that was his defense
that they're they're among the best I
mean there's a very long list of polling
companies
Rasmussen is always in that top tier
give me a fact Jack is that not true
tell me that's not true I believe
they're always in the top you know at
least five or ten or something
and they're out of a long list
so he got so Larry Elder was uh denied
because of the Rasmussen poll that that
wasn't good enough
now the Rasmussen poll has a little bit
to do with my personal history so I
might be a little sensitive to this
question
but uh this is unacceptable the
Republicans need to fix this
Republicans you need to fix this
yeah you need to put Larry Elder on that
stage or change your rules either change
your rules or put them on the stage
but this is not cool not cool at all in
fact I think the other candidates should
rebel against it I think the other
candidates should insist he be included
because it's a big stage nobody's going
to get much time anyway so why would you
why would you with your own team
over something like this
no I don't think it's racist but it
certainly
is certainly wrong
all right
I think that's all I have for today uh
oh by the way the
uh reframe your brain the audiobook is
submitted to Amazon as well as the soft
cover I don't know when they're going to
say yes
but all of our work I think is done
so maybe today maybe tomorrow you'll you
have both the audiobook the audiobook is
not in my voice because my dyslexia was
uh too great for me to record it
by the way here's a tip for dyslexics do
we have any dyslexics here or anybody
who has a child who's dyslexic
um if you do and there's a reading
problem
uh
consider teaching them speed reading
because speed reading is sort of which
is something I learned when I was very
young now I'm not like an expert speed
reader but the the basic well I'll give
you an example all right I'll take one
of my own sentences here
to speed read let's see if I can pick
one
um
all right so here's one of my sentences
I wrote to myself I said I'd watch a
program that explained all the political
hoaxes of the past several years and how
they were done
now if you're not dyslexic you read this
in the order written each word just in
the order if you are dyslexic the words
Jump Around
but if you speed read you're looking for
the keywords and then you're resembling
them in your mind
so I'd look at the keywords and like uh
program political hoaxes yeah I'd watch
that
program political hoaxes so that's how I
read this if someone else had written it
I would say uh what's up with a program
about political because that sounds good
and then I would just keep reading
so I just this just a wild idea just try
it
see if you can if you're dyslexic or you
know somebody who has tried not reading
the sentence in the order
try picking out the keywords and then
Yoda the sentence
do you know what I mean by Yoda in the
sentence
here's what I mean Yoda the character
would say he wouldn't say the boy hit
the ball
Yoda would say ball hit by boy or
something like that right he would he
would reverse the words but you know
what he's talking about
because if there's a bat the boy in the
ball
you kind of immediately Yeah Boy bat
ball he hit the ball right
so speed reading is pick out the
keywords
assemble them in your mind
you know unyielded them
and then just decide what that must have
said
now if there's a sentence where it's
like a key sentence so you know you
really got to get that one right well
then you stop
and if you go slowly enough
you know you're fine
um
I don't know what that comment is about
yes oh there yeah there's also a way to
print things so they're easier to read
that really works there's an example on
the locals platform going by of a
paragraph in which part of each word is
highlighted but not the entire word
and because we tend to read the first
part of words but not necessarily the
whole word because you know what the
word rest of the word is right that just
looking at the first parts
creates a landscape in which the words
are further distanced from each other
does that make sense if you only
highlighted the first two or three
letters of each word in a sentence and
you looked at it the highlighted Parts
would be pretty distant from each other
and probably distant enough
that you wouldn't mix them the way you
would with a regular pack sentence so
because you don't need the rest of the
word
so if you see a refrigerator you know I
refrs tells you it's refrigerator right
because you can also tell how long it is
so
that might actually be really
interesting I I would imagine that you
could write a program
oh I wonder if anybody's done this I
wonder if anybody's written a program
that changes regular text into that
highlighted first part of the text thing
that would be useful it would definitely
increase your reading
John Q pure public is yelling at me in
all caps over and over again can you say
Mensa moral LOL can you say mental
John Q public
