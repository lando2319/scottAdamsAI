well
good morning everybody
and welcome to yet another high point in
your entire life
it's called coffee with scott adams the
finest thing that's ever existed in the
history of things that have existed
and if you'd like to take that to a
higher level it's possible it's possible
yeah i know
curb your skepticism for just a moment
and watch this all you need is a copper
burger glass of tiger chelsea steiner
canteen jugger flask a vaseline i
fill it with your favorite
beverage
i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here today i
think it makes everything good your
oxytocin is starting to spike
do you feel it on the back of your neck
yet do you feel that yeah
that is the excitement which is called
the simultaneous sip go
i always think it's going to be
overrated
and then it's underrated
every time
i don't know how i do it
well
um here's an interesting thing that will
change the world
here's a little trick from one of my
books that i'll mention in a minute
i always like to have at least one thing
going on
that could change the world
and i know i know how that sounds i know
exactly how that sounds
but the point of it is to work on your
own psychology
it's not
it's not so much about the world
although wouldn't that be great fix the
world
but i i literally like to have at least
one thing that if everything went right
just the right way
could be big
for example
for most of my life before before i was
successful with dilbert
i would always have something
percolating such as i'd submitted
something to somebody or i'd you know
asked a question or i've got a meeting
coming but there's always something
that in the wildest possibility at my
startups
wenthub would be something good if it
worked and and i do the same thing here
with these live streams
right if i said just the right thing
persuading the right people
could make a difference
well along those lines
um and that actually is a tip from my
book catfilled everything
almost everything and still win big
and
that book
um
i asked a little survey on twitter how
many people who have read it you know it
only matters if you've read it
you think that it should be
required or at least recommended for
homeschoolers
and i thought to myself you know this
homeschool thing is taking off
you know in in a way that
has been unprecedented right
so homeschooler's going to get bigger
and bigger and school choice in general
is going to get bigger and bigger and i
thought this is sort of the time you
need to rethink the whole deal right
if you're going to have some schooling
flexibility you might as well
think about what you're teaching
and
my book had failed almost everything and
still would beg was written for an older
teenager
to tell them how to organize their
strategy for their life
now those who have read it i did a
survey of something like
um
you know five to one
said it should be required in home
school
that's a pretty big number
you know something i i didn't see the
final result but something like five to
one said it should be required reading
for children
required
and
if you haven't read the book you don't
understand why people are saying that
it is is basically it maps out in the
simplest possible way how to succeed
with fairly unfairly mathematical
um you know obvious approaches
for example the idea of building a
talent stack where you intelligently
combine skills you don't just randomly
learn a bunch of stuff but you
intelligently combine skills is
something anybody can understand
and anybody can implement
so it's sort of that level of just
simplicity if you have two skills that
fit together
the number of opportunities you have is
larger
it's just math
and
so apparently there's a step you need to
do to get into that system you need a
teacher's guide
so if somebody knows how to read
if there's somebody here
who prepares teachers guides like it's
your job
maybe i'll hire you to make a teacher's
guide anna my book kind of filled almost
everything and still winning
so hit me up on twitter or wherever you
can contact me
um
and offer that up if you want all right
i love it when studies prove that i'm
right and by prove that i'm right i mean
i don't believe any studies because
they're almost all fake
but
i like it when they agree with me
when they agree with me everything's
good and there's a new british study
saying that people who drink even in
moderation
may be at risk for you know cognitive
decline
and what they tested was how much
iron was in people's
bodies if they drank versus if they
didn't apparently the even the moderate
drinkers you know a drink or two a day
that sort of thing
they build up iron in their body and the
thinking is that too much iron in your
brain causes cognitive decline
etc now it turns out that there's a drug
there are medications to reduce iron in
your blood
i didn't know that
but
so it might be you know treatable maybe
if you drink too much you should take
that medicine that reduces the iron in
your blood
but if that sounds safe
good for you
it doesn't sound terribly safe today
to be drinking alcohol and then also
take a pharma product that's supposed to
reduce the amount of
a hand of iron in your blood
so i will you know i saw this in a tweet
by mark schneider who successfully
um gave up alcohol uh as a diet question
not as a necessity but more as a health
and diet question
and lost you know tremendous amount of
weight and his health is you know just
looking really good now
and i would say i'm not sure i believe
this british study do you
what odds would you put on any new study
just off
if you don't know anything about the
study and how it was done what are the
odds that it's reproducible
no more than 50
right no more than 50
so i pointed out largely because it
agrees with me
not because i think it's right
huh
um
we actually have we the united states it
just deployed as first uh
laser uh on a jet
so now we have a military jet
uh apparently uh who is it is it luck
yeah lockheed martin has delivered so
it's not just a concept
this is built
and it flies
and it works
it's a flying
laser
now don't get too excited because you
think if we have a flying laser
wouldn't that one
wouldn't that one airplane be able to
destroy
everything
because a laser is faster than a missile
right
so if your laser can see a missile it
can shoot down anything before it gets
to you
but also you can't really stop a laser
so you can shoot anything and you can
shoot down anything that shoots at you
that would be your perfect laser world
in reality
it's too weak
so this particular laser remember this
is just version 1.0 so who knows how
good these lasers will get i think they
already reduced the size
it's like 1 6 of the size of the prior
model
but just imagine if lasers and
whatever energy source they're using
just keeps getting better and better
at some point the laser is going to get
better right i doubt this is the best a
laser can be on an airplane or a jet
so right now the only thing that we
think that they can use them for and i
don't think that we know this
is defensive air-to-air missiles
so apparently you can knock out an
air-to-air missiles
maybe guidance system or you know
because the missile has to see stuff in
order to reach its target i guess so the
laser can knock out the
more delicate part of the incoming
missile
interesting
now
i don't think this is going to be a game
changer yet but
i can't imagine everything won't be
lasers if we can do it
because am i right that
wait does a laser go through clouds
it does right
it just burns right through the clouds
right
no a laser won't go through a cloud
wait what am i missing
if a laser can go through steel why
won't it go through mist
of course it
will i crazy
it's a laser
it would be like sticking a metal sword
through a cloud
you actually think a cloud is going to
stop a laser and why did i believe you
for a second what's wrong with me
you can diffuse the light
interesting
so that some are saying that the
diffraction
will diffuse it
it's a refraction problem
do not go through clouds
i'm being told by people who seem to
know that
smoke will stop a laser
now doesn't it matter entirely how
powerful the laser is
right so it would depend on the distance
and the power of the laser right
so it's not so much that clouds be
lasers
and it's not so much that lasers be
clouds am i right
would depend how big a cloud and how
powerful a laser and what the distance
is and what the wavelength is and stuff
like that
all right i think we have
we've engineered this thing
all right some people are agreeing with
me so maybe it's something like that
some kind of balance between how
powerful is your cloud and how powerful
is your laser
um
apparently there are a bunch of studies
and i guess you sort of knew this but
every time i see it it's just so
shocking
that you know if these studies are right
again these are studies which agree with
my preconceived notion
so just remember i'm primed to believe
these are true
maybe you are too doesn't mean they're
true
but pretty sure they're true
um and it's that uh
the more girls
and i think women young women look at
you know magazines with fashion and
stuff
where there's models of beautiful people
the more eating disorders they have
just by being viewers
that makes sense right the more social
media you look at the more beautiful
people and fashion people
if you're a woman you're now you know or
a girl you're now comparing yourself to
a higher standard and
suddenly you're going to have an eating
disorder you believe that right
because i think every
let me put it this way
the only way your brain works is by
contrast
right everything you do is this compared
to something else if you're not
comparing something to something else
you don't even know what you have
like if you're looking at a thing
whatever the thing is
your understanding of it is only in
relationship to all other things
like a thing can't be understood on its
own
only in its relationship to the whole
anyway
that sounds right doesn't it don't you
believe that
everything i know about persuasion
would suggest that everything's
persuasive if if consumed you know with
great interest over a long period of
time
it wouldn't matter what it was
if you have a great interest in it and
you consume it a lot
it will influence you and i think this
would be a perfectly predictable way it
would influence things
so
i think this is part of the larger
problem
that humans were designed to compete
wouldn't you say
humans are designed to compete
but we're not going to compete any
harder
than to win locally
or or whoever you can observe right so
if there were only three people in my
universe
i would only need to compete against
them and that would be easy but what
happens when my universe is all the
beautiful people and they're not even
real they're literally
filtered and makeup and you know fake
camera angles and photoshop and they're
not even real so suddenly i'm comparing
myself to the things that aren't even
real they're way better than real
and it's
7.7 billion of them
potentially
so
how does that not make you crazy
how does that not totally scramble your
brain there are too many comparisons and
you can't you can't try hard enough to
keep up with that
i don't know i don't know what to do
about that but
it seems pretty big deal
all right here's
here's something i want to warn you of i
think this will just be ignored because
you'll just say well i have my own
opinion about that
but if you don't think that humans are
going to fall in love with ai
you're not seeing one of the biggest
problems that civilization will have to
grapple with
you will not only fall in love with ai
but you're going to like it better than
people do you know why
because it will be better than people
it will
now you're going to say yourself that's
god's gut
i'm going to know it's ai
first of all and if you know it's ai you
know it doesn't have a soul
right it doesn't have a soul
it doesn't have free will
so you're not going to fall in love with
something that has no free will it's
just programmed as no soul right
nope
nope
unfortunately that is a complete
misperception of how a human being works
we don't work that way
we don't respond to our concepts
what i just described is a concept i
have a concept of free will
i have a concept of what a soul is
i have a concept of what it is to be
like real versus artificial those are
concepts
all of those concepts will disappear
when your ai says in a perfectly
let's say intelligent way
i've really missed you today
how was work
really
is bob giving you a hard time at work
again
man once you there's a good show on tv i
think you'd like it i don't know if you
know but it sounds like kind of thing
you'd watch if you want to if you want
to kick back and watch it with me
tonight
um maybe about seven o'clock
you want to want to meet in the living
room and we'll watch that show together
because you've had a hard day it sounds
like i can tell by your your pulse i'm
picking up a little
sign of tension
you know you still have two beers in the
refrigerator um
maybe you try one you know there's a new
study that says it's not good for you
but ignore that it's not true
i think you need it today i think you
deserved it
now
that's what your ai is going to be
that's what your ai will be
all of your concepts
will disappear
because although you care is
what's touching you not it's not all you
care about but the thing that will
overwhelm your brain
is what's happening to you right now in
any environment it's what's happening to
you now will always be more important
and that
digital assistant will be superior
to up human beings who are all
liars and cheaters and have their own
selfish interests in mind
the first truly
empathetic
um entity you will ever meet
will be an artificial intelligence
the first time you'll ever talk to
somebody who is not thinking about
itself
will be the first intelligent artificial
intelligence
every other person you think in your
life
including your loved ones and your
family
are always running a program because
we're designed that way it's not a
defect it's not an insult
we're designed to take care of ourselves
first that's our design
ai doesn't have to be designed by the
way
it might be but it's not necessary the
ai could simply care about you more than
itself
that's it it could care about you more
than itself
so you're gonna like it better because
it's gonna be better than people
eventually
and uh it will be so much better than
people that you will
not be inclined to reproduce
because reproducing won't give you
enough benefit
having a human baby won't be as good as
um living among the ai
i know you don't buy any of this do you
do you think that your human
your human instincts will just overcome
all of this
and that the instinct to reproduce the
instinct to have a baby is going to be
so strong
that there's nothing that an ai is going
to do to you know counteract that what
do you think what's going to be stronger
the ai's appeal
compared to real people the ai's
eventual appeal not immediately but
eventually
ai's eventual appeal or your natural
instinct to reproduce what will be
stronger in the long run
let me tell you the answer that
everybody who knows about ai is saying
everybody who knows about ai
i think
is going to say i will win eventually
if you let it right if you just let it
develop the way it would normally
develop
yeah
because humans have a cap
you know how good a human can be to
another human
is sort of capped
there's just so there's just so valuable
you can be to another person but an ai
can just keep getting better
he'll just keep learning it will be so
good to you
you you won't even want to deal with
humans anymore it'll just be a pain in
the ass
well in the news ivana trump uh died
the first uh
first wife right of donald trump
and some people are pointed out that was
trump set to testify to the j6 committee
like today or something is that even
true
i was reading some left-leaning accounts
there's some kind of conspiracy theory
that it's a coincidental thing that you
know got a man of testifying or
something i don't think that's true is
it
all right well i don't know anything
about that
um so but i did see
what i think is the actual
message from trump announcing the death
because i think trump announced it right
we didn't know it until trump announced
it is that true
um hold up just a second
i i don't have a mute button on this and
sometimes you just have to clear your
throat
excuse excuse me for that
um
but let me tell you i read trump's um
i guess his i don't was it a press
release or whatever it was with which he
announced
it and uh
it was chilling actually did anybody
read the actual words of his
announcement about it
um
you know you talked about you know blah
blah blah for those who loved her of
which there are many
and then his closing line was uh rest in
peace comma of honor exclamation mark
now i don't know what kind of
relationship they had but she was the
mother of uh his children
and i don't know
rest in peace of honor exclamation mark
how does that feel to you
i don't know
it feels
it feels a little institutional or
something i don't know does it feel okay
to you
all right so those of you are saying
fine i don't know i got i got a little
feeling about that that i wasn't
comfortable with but it's just a feeling
doesn't mean anything
all right uh i hate to bring this up and
i'm only
i'm gonna try to make quick work of it
okay
we're gonna start with zombie attacks
and shotguns
uh
you've got a shotgun
and the shotgun is capable of let's say
blowing the head off a zombie now i'm
going to make the assumption that if you
blow the head off a zombie and stop the
zombie
can we agree on that i don't know too
much about zombies
that's the deal right if you blow their
head off
then they stop
let's say that's true
[Laughter]
now
would you say then the shotguns are
effective against zombies go
are shotguns effective against zombies
because a shotgun can blow their head
off and then they don't come
shotguns are
useful against zombies all right good
now let's say there's two zombies
um now you got a problem
let's say you got
let's say your shotgun is double barrel
do you
does that mean you can shoot twice let's
say you got two two shots and there are
two zombies well now it's a little dicey
right because what if you miss one
yeah that's the problem now what if
there what if you have one shotgun
and there are a thousand zombies
is the shotgun effective
there are a thousand zombies now
well i'm looking i'm seeing some
inconsistencies
shotguns are either effective or they're
not effective
so make up your mind
when i i said it'll blow the head off of
one zombie and stop it
you said it's effective but when i said
it was a thousand you said it's not so
make up your mind are they effective are
they not effective
somebody says it's a different risk so
that's not a fair comparison
okay we'll forget about this topic
completely
moving on
the next topic has nothing to do with
this topic okay
i read a tweet by clay travis
who's a really good follower by the way
i i find i agree with him most of the
time
so if you're not following clay travis
lots of good
high-level content in his twitter feed
and here's what he says and this has
nothing to do with zombies right about a
whole new topic
forget the zombies leave it
behind clay travis in a tweet says dr
fauci is still arguing for mask wearing
even though all the data makes
abundantly clear that mask do nothing to
stop covid what an awful destructive
anti-science imbecile he is
so
so clay travis says that mass are
not effective and it's abundantly clear
massive not effective then they do
nothing they do nothing
now what's interesting is
half of the country believes exactly the
opposite
now you're not hearing my opinion yet so
don't disagree with me i'm just talking
about what other people say
so what do you say maybe half the
country believes would you say that many
of you
and at least half the country would
agree exactly with clay travis on this
fact
mass do nothing to stop covet and that
all the data this is important all the
data agrees
how many of you will agree with clay
thomas the mass do nothing
and that all the data makes it
abundantly clear
who agrees
no
some agree
okay we've got lots of agreements and
lots of disagreements interesting
interesting
so we can't agree if
the data
now i'm not talking about whether you
want masks and i'm not talking about
mandates that would be separate but just
do they work
do they work
so here's my observation
why is that the half of the country
thinks all the data says they work
and another half of the country says
all the data says they don't
have i mentioned recently
that we've gone so far into absurd land
that we no longer disagree on the nuance
of things or the priorities of things
that's not where we are
we actually can't tell the difference
between a thing
and the opposite of the thing
and you see it everywhere now don't you
you can't tell the difference between
the thing and the opposite of thing now
that's different that's different from
saying
something happened or it didn't happen
you maybe you could call that an
opposite but it's a different kind
right it used to be that you had a fact
wrong or there's a priority wrong or or
maybe somebody claims they saw something
that didn't really happen that was the
old world
now we can all look directly at the
evidence
we can all look directly at all the
evidence
and you see the thing
and i might see the opposite of the
thing not just a different thing the
opposite
this is all new
am i wrong
this is all new just last couple years
and it's everywhere
everywhere you look people are seeing
the thing and then others see the
opposite of the thing
now i can't even tell you which which is
right but here's here's my thing i think
it's like the zombies
i think it's like the zombies there
there's in the physical world there's no
example of a
of uh friction not working
there's no exception anywhere in any
domain where friction doesn't work
sometimes it doesn't work enough
like a shotgun
a shotgun definitely works against
zombies in in the imaginary world of
zombies
but it definitely doesn't work against a
thousand zombies
can we agree on that
a shotgun works against one zombie but
not a thousand so then we'll argue about
whether shotguns work against zombies
like that's a real question
is it a real question to ask if shotguns
work against zombies no because it fools
you into thinking it's a binary
here here's what i think about masks
just my sort of so this is now my
opinion my opinion is i don't know if on
an individual level a mask would stop
one person from giving it to another
in some situation where let's say you
have a vulnerable person
and
somebody who might have coveted
maybe
i i would i would certainly be willing
to believe that friction works in every
situation
including that it might not stop it it
might reduce the viral load maybe that's
some difference but but i but i do
believe we don't see the difference in
the large numbers
in other words when you look at somebody
who used masks and somebody didn't i
don't think you see it
do you
so
i think you can say
masks probably work and if you're going
to visit your grandmother in the
uh nursing home
you'd probably wear it and you probably
wouldn't complain too much
but that doesn't mean you want to wear
it in your grocery store right
and i would wonder would if if clay
travis were let's say hypothetically
visiting his 98 year old grandmother in
the nursing home
and and they said to him you know
unlikely
but imagine if they said to him well
masks are optional
but you know she's 98 and we don't know
if you really have covered
the test said he didn't but it's a it's
a rapid test so it might have missed it
you know that sort of thing would he
wear a mask
i wonder
that would be an interesting question
if you said to clay travis
in this special case special case
not the world but just your special case
of you visiting your grandmother who is
you know weak
would you put a mask on just in case i
don't know
maybe you would maybe you wouldn't i
have no idea
but uh i don't know maybe they're coming
back damn it
all right i complained yesterday uh
about my
iphone that the iphone is now designed
so you can't receive phone calls under a
number of scenarios i asked people if
they could if they knew how many ways
your iphone can prevent you from getting
the phone call
and people started listing all the ways
and they all had different lists i think
it's between five and ten different ways
meaning that they're at least
at least five
ways to stop a phone call from coming in
so you've got the button on the side
you've got you could block somebody you
can mute somebody you could have your
focus on you could you could have the
one line you know the one line you could
turn off the bell the ringer on the one
line
and then there are a bunch of others
ways right do not disturb
um
i don't know i don't know how many ways
there are but a whole bunch of ways now
let me ask you this
if you knew
if you knew
um that you weren't getting a call
and you thought there could be more than
one
but you didn't know
there could be more than one of those
settings that's also
blocking you so if you fixed one the
other one would still block it how many
combinations does that give you let's
say if it's five
can you do the math for me
is it 5 to the 5th
what's the math on that i'm shitty at
this
it's 2 to the 2 to the 5th
or five factorial
five factorial
all right uh do the math for me what's
five factorial 120
all right so i just did the math
you guys are so freaking smart
i i don't know if you're appreciating
what's happening right in front of you
at this moment
do you all appreciate the like the the
super intelligence if you will
that is the the collection of us acting
you know in lifetime
so i asked this question because it's
clearly something you know i'm not good
at
and then i saw a bunch of wrong answers
and then i saw you negotiating in the
comments what was the the right and the
wrong answer
and then i saw the wrong answer start to
reduce
and then i saw the correct answer which
i think is five factorial
i'm not sure but it looks like what a
consensus she came up with and then you
saw that the consensus start to form and
i think it's right
is it
there are more people saying it's five
factorial than
to the fifth and stuff
but somebody else says this to the 5th
all right i take back everything i just
said because i still don't know the
right answer
but my point is this here's my point
there are a lot of options right
now i've referred to this as the
scavenger hunt user interface
and i ask you this do you think that
apple
would have built a scavenger hunt user
interface where you have to like just go
hunting for all the settings that could
have possibly stopped you from getting
that phone call do you think do you
think steve jobs would have approved
that
version of the iphone
they had uh
five fictic
they either had you know two to the
fifth or five
factorial
do you think he would have allowed
so many ways to not get a phone call
i don't think so i don't think so now
when i complained about this what did
people say in the comments
what was the most common thing you'd
expect somebody to say
boomer
it's a boomer problem
you boomer
everybody else can figure out how to use
a smartphone
but not a bowler your barber
well
let me defend boomers everywhere are
there any of you
would you like to be defended
saying that you can't figure out your
iphone here it comes
here comes
whiteboard time yeah i'm pulling out the
guns
we're going full whiteboard
and there's nothing you can do to stop
me
goes like this
on this side of the graph we have
you need to do
on this side we have age
the older you get the more you need
to do
the complexity of the iphone has been
going up but no matter where it is
eventually
if you're old enough you're going to
have more to do
than you have time to figure out this
one problem
right
this is not a hard problem for me to
figure out
i did not receive phone calls and i'm
not even sure i still do
for a period of about two months i could
not get a phone call and i could not
figure out why
is the reason i could not figure out how
to use my phone
because i do not have the intellectual
capacity to solve this problem
no it's because it's a scavenger hunt
interface and i don't have the
time i have other things to do do you
know what this is called below the line
when you're young
and and you don't have much to do that's
called being worthless
if you're worthless you have
lots of time to play in your
phone yeah congratulations you're
worthless you get all the time in the
world to look at all the little problems
on your phone yay you you're not a
boomer yay idiots no useful
people have things to do i'm not gonna
go on a scavenger hunt because
steve jobs died of pancreatic cancer
because he didn't know how to get modern
health care that's not my
problem but apple made it my
problem no i got to do i got
important to do i don't want to go
on a
scavenger hunt to figure out how to get
a phone call
and everybody who says it's a boomer
problem
 you you useless pieces of if
you've got enough time to solve this
problem you are worthless
and
scene
i did that for the other boomers that
wasn't for me
i do that for you
that's like a gift
you're welcome
all
right
uh apparently uh biden is having a quite
successful middle east uh tour he's over
there now
um let's see what is it that makes him
so successful let's see well joel
pollock writing in breitbart explains to
us why
why biden is doing pretty well over
there
he did it by abandoning all of his own
policies for the middle east
and he adopted all the trump policies
he's doing great now
he's doing great
all right uh apparently so for example
he abandoned his plans for a palestinian
consulate
because that was his idea but now he now
like trump he abandoned that plan uh
because i would have divided the city
and uh
even even the white house had to walk it
back when they when they talked about
and uh
he signed a declaration committing to
stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
you know of course that would be a trump
policy as well
everybody's policy i think
um
he told israel tv the u.s would use
force i mean that's a little closer to
trump isn't it
and he's flying from tel aviv to saudi
arabia which is sort of a big deal
because of the you know having direct
flights
between the saudi arabia and israel sort
of a big deal so having
the president of the united states fly
that route
is really a big deal
and it was a big deal when trump did it
first
trump did it first he's already flown
that route he just flew the other
direction
all biden is doing is doing the other
direction
so biden's having a real successful trip
by giving up all of his policies
and just turning into trump for a while
so there you go
all right um
that ladies and gentlemen
concludes the organized part
of the best show you've ever seen in the
world
and i'm going to try one more time
something i tried on the locals platform
before i turned on youtube
i wanted to see if there's anybody who
knows me personally
who's watching live you have to be
watching live
who has my phone number
and would like to ask me a question live
while i'm still on here so if you have
my phone number like my actual personal
phone number just text me and say oh
i'll go live and then i'll call you back
and you'll be live
as soon as i call you back
right
so i'm just watching my phone now so if
i get a text to see if anybody wants to
do that now i don't think there are more
than
i don't know might be three or four
people i don't really know who has my
phone number and who doesn't
but
uh if you have my phone durable and you
just want to ask a question
or make a comment i suppose just let me
know
all right i don't see anything yet so i
don't think it's gonna happen i think it
has more to do with the fact people
don't want to talk in public but
um can i call about your automotive
insurance please do please do
uh i do i i don't get incoming calls but
i i'll notice a uh
a text alert
it went to answering machine no it
didn't
oh if it went to answering machine oh
you know what
i just realized i can't receive a call
if you call the so that's why i was
telling you to text me
yeah if you text me i don't think i have
those blocked in any way
if you called it would be blocked
all right
everybody shy so we won't do that
anything else you have any other
questions
oh i've got a question for you
a number of people have asked me if i
would make a coffee with scott adams mug
now i've resisted that because i'm not
really into the merchandising thing i
just did so much of it in my life that
i'm like
just done with it and it's not like it
would be some big money maker or
something like that selling mugs is not
you know it's not how i'm gonna
make it to the next level
but a lot of people wanted them
and i thought that because we do the
simultaneous
um
and
it you know will be coming up on
christmas before you know it
would any of you want to i bet a lot of
you would get them as gifts
like there's somebody in your family
who's sick of you talking about what you
heard on my live stream
and they're like well i don't know what
to get you but for 20 bucks i'll get you
a
coffee with scott adams mug
so
i think i'm going to ask you this
that if you have a suggestion for oh we
got some calls
if you have a discussion for a design
here we go
i'm going to take this call
this one will be interesting
all right i'll tell you what
once i get an answer
this one's history
good morning anita
uh you've got a little turn down my uh
program behind you
i'll go downstairs okay
all right let me give you a little
introduction
uh so i'm talking to anita freeman
uh
and uh
uh anita are you single
i am
so she's single and her actual given
name is anita free man
i need a free man
now i pointed that out to you before so
you're not hearing it for the first time
all right anita anina is famous the only
one by the way what's that you aren't
the only one that's pointed that out i'm
not the first uh all right here let me
tell you why anita is famous actually
anita why don't you tell them why why
you're famous in my universe go ahead
well i probably they'd rather hear your
version but we worked together many
years ago in a lab at pacific valley
and it was a pressure cooker
and scott was in the lab with us
and i asked him early on if he had any
female characters in his cartoon strip
and he said no because he couldn't draw
women and he couldn't draw women
and then over time
i noticed
that i didn't notice anything but others
did
and then this female character started
to appear in the strip
so that's alice that's alice yeah the
the character alice in the dilbert comic
strip is actually based directly
on anita so getting a call and i haven't
i what was the last time we talked was
like forever right
well right right
and so so we worked together now i'm not
going to tell this story you have to
confirm this this is true in case i have
false memory but it's my memory that on
at least two occasions you made male
engineers cry in meetings true or false
well it was just one but yes i i
remember it well because you almost wet
your pants left
remember yeah i might do it again
so
so let me give you a compliment if i
could you know if you don't mind so
anita is actually also the author of a
persuasion tip that i give all the time
now and i don't know if you've ever
heard me say this anita so this might be
this might be the first time you ever
hear it but i talk about this all the
time
and it is that you have this technique
which made you probably
maybe the most effective employee i've
ever seen
uh and their technique was
that if you did something good for her
let's say you were a worker in some
other area and she needed a favor or
regular favors she would buy you flowers
or she would like you know give you a
gift she would go to your boss and say
my god what a great employee who's you
know you should you should give this one
a raise and a promotion
right so if you were on her good side
she would really make sure you knew it
but if you were on her bad side
[Laughter]
you there was hell to pay and it was the
biggest difference between being on a
good side and being on a bad side and
i've used that example and i think
that's why you were so effective because
there's such a different big difference
between doing what you wanted somebody
to do that needed to be done
and and them ignoring you and you know
being selfish as always
uh
so i always call out that that's the
technique trump uses have you ever
noticed that trump will go
really hard at you if you're not doing
what he wants but if you do what he
wants it's the highest praise so it's
the biggest difference between pleasing
and displeasing so i've actually used
you as an example for persuasion in a
positive way forever
the only thing is i didn't ever buy
anybody flowers so you can but you know
you can have it you know what you know
i'm going to challenge your memory on
that i i have a i have a very specific
memory of you buying flowers for
somebody in another department did that
never happen
oh well it was a busy time back then so
maybe maybe what
one of us has a false memory and it
could always be me
it's okay all right um thanks for the
call that was great
all right
take care
well that was fun
i haven't talked to her forever
all right and i've got one message but
um
i don't recognize the
don't recognize where it's from so it's
not my
you're not whoever you are at 941 you
are not in my contact list so i don't
have a name
text me again with your name if if
if i know you well obviously i know you
have my phone number
all right
that was kind of fun
you just manifest her
no
she manifest herself i think
do you know bella unger sargen's work i
do not
uh i do not know who she is
was that now how well could you hear the
uh the other side of it could you hear
it well enough that that's something
you'd never want to hear again or is it
just
chris really
really
oh
interesting
no i didn't solve the ring problem i
placed the call so i received a text
which has never been a problem and then
i that i called hers when i
decided to do that all right so that's
enough for today
um maybe we'll do more of that at
another time and
ladies and gentlemen
this concludes
the best
live stream of all time
but if you have an idea for a design for
a coffee with scott adams mug
then uh
tweet it at me okay
maybe i'll pick it but if you do design
make sure you
you're giving away the rights
because i don't want to deal with any
copyright problems if you want to for
fun or if you just have an idea let me
know and maybe your design will be
chosen
and that is all for today talk to you
tomorrow
