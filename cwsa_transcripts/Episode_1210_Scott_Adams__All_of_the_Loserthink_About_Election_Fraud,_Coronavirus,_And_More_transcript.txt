like
coffee join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dope media of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
sometimes it's better if you have
an actual cup of coffee go
i don't know that might be the best one
ever
so i hear the wonder woman movie is
coming out and here's the big news about
that
apparently it doesn't suck so there's a
movie
and i don't have a fact check on this
but according to the early reviews
the wonder woman movie is quite good
i hope that's true i'll give it i'll
give it a look
there's a poll by gallup
that finds that 17 percent of americans
are
does that sound a little bit low to you
now that's not how they worded the poll
but that's what they found
uh the way they worded it which i guess
you this just another way to put it
they found that 83 percent of americans
think the the media is biased
now according to my math if 83 percent
think
the media is biased that does leave 17
of americans who don't think the media
is biased
so 17 of americans are idiots according
to a poll
uh so yesterday i'm trying to mine my
own business
and i thought you know what would be
what would be good
to take a break from twitter for just a
few hours
because i'm i'm on twitter all day long
can't keep off i'm addicted
and i thought just a few hours off of
twitter tomorrow
just clear my head try to live like
like a life in the real world for just a
little bit
and i thought to myself you know a
couple hours off of twitter
what am i going to miss i mean i'm not
going to miss very much in a couple
hours right
well in those couple of hours when i was
off twitter president trump retweeted me
four times
now i don't want to make too much of
this
but today in the news we found that
there was a fourth
uh obelisk or a monolith if you like
found in yet another remote location
so i'm just saying
trump retweeted me four times yesterday
and the fourth monolith was found
that could be a coincidence could be
don't make too much of it i'm just
saying
i don't know i'm not i'm not saying
they're necessarily connected
but they're both for and that can't be a
coincidence
all right so the the funniest thing
about
being retweeted by the president four
times in one day
is it creates this weird reaction from
my critics
who they all climb out of their holes
and
out from underneath the rocks or
wherever my critics go when they're not
bothering me
you always wonder that don't you when
your critic is
you know abusing you online and you say
to yourself well i can imagine where
they are right at this moment
probably using a phone or typing on a
keyboard
but where do my critics go when they're
not actually
actively abusing me i assume it's holes
you might think homes or apartments but
i think holes
i think they live in just holes possibly
under rocks
but they come out and they say this sort
of thing
that i'm desperate to be relevant
which is weirdly true so i don't know
how that's exactly a criticism
is there anybody who doesn't really
really want to be relevant
i mean i guess it depends on your
definition of relevant
but is there somebody who wants to go
the other direction on that
is there anybody who wakes up every day
and says god i hope i can remain
irrelevant today
i feel like with a little work i can go
through the whole day without any
relevance at all
so when you accuse me of desperately
wanting to be relevant
i say compared to what
exactly because i feel like that would
be the winning attitude wouldn't it
to try to be relative relevant it feels
like that's something you should
teach children in school
children you're going to grow up and you
know wouldn't it be great
if you tried to be relevant
so first of all my critics like to
compliment me
while imagining that it's an insult but
the funny thing is they're accusing me
of being a has-been
while they themselves have never been
at exactly the moment the president is
tweeting me four times
which makes me a has being
like at this very moment i'm being
relevant
not you know not my own doing right the
president tweeted me i didn't know that
was going to happen
but at this very moment i'm being
relevant
and my critics are saying well always
desperately trying to be relevant
anyway it always makes me laugh cnn
analyst
jessica huseman tweeted this when she
saw the president
retweeting me and she said one of the
more bewildering things about 2020
has been the creator of dilbert becoming
a relevant figure in national politics
i i tweeted back and said that the
competition wasn't very stiff
um so here's here's one of the tweets
and i think it was the one that maybe
got the most attention and this was i
was retweeting
mike cordray's uh suggestion that the
president used an executive order
to ban the uh smarmatic
machines and dominion from future
elections
but do it based on uh homeland security
if you do it under a security umbrella
i think people will say oh we get that
this is a
machines that send our votes overseas
there's some foreign ownership
yeah of course that should be secured
that situation should be secured for
national security
and the president retweeted that with
one word
interesting with an exclamation
now i do know from my own my own sources
that although this might have been a new
a new thought
to the president specifically that maybe
an executive order banning these
accounting machines not the counting
machines the voting machines
might make some sense at least to be
considered but apparently
uh the administration or the people who
need to be working
on this stuff within the administration
it's not a new idea to them
so do not be surprised if this turns
into an actual executive order
not because i tweeted it but because
apparently it was a good idea
uh independent of you know anybody else
thinking of it also it turns out that if
you are
do this kind of work for the government
it occurs to you that you should maybe
look into this
and they were so the good news is your
government was
very much on top of this it didn't need
any tweets from me
apparently trump is uh considering uh
this is reported who knows how true it
is that
uh that he's gonna do this made for tv
uh big event when he leaves the white
house
should that be the outcome and biden is
being
inaugurated so he wants to counter
program
uh biden's inauguration with a big showy
you know leaving the white house in in
air force one which would technically
not be air force one but you know what
i'm talking about and
um and then doing a rally to
counter-program them
i can't tell you how much i love this
idea
i love this idea so much that i want to
marry it
because on one hand it's you know he's
breaking norms and
i guess it's disrespectful to the
incoming president
and blah blah blah but we like our
entertainment
and one of the things that trump has
done completely accidentally
is he's made us all far more aware of
politics
there are things about the law the
supreme court and
how congress works under unusual
situations
i learned so much this year just
watching all the
shenanigans but uh i would love to watch
i would love to know that the public was
so engaged in politics
that you could have two major events an
inauguration and counter programming
at the same time you know i think that's
why
not i think but of course we had greater
engagement
in the election this year than ever
before
there is there is a positive element to
this if it makes us pay attention
there's a story about rudy giuliani he
has
been tested he has coronavirus
now i don't want to brag and
indeed i don't know if there's anything
to brag about here
so that's my question when rudy appeared
on
was it remind me which uh
which hearing it was was it michigan
which was the hearing in which rudy was
all sweaty
it was just like a week ago right and
when
i turned on the tv and i saw rudy at one
of those hearings i forget which state
and he was conspicuously
sweaty and of course i've seen him on tv
a billion times
and i know that he's you know
comfortable on camera so it's not about
the situation
you know i i was somebody says
pennsylvania i think that's right
um so i didn't think there was anything
about the situation that would make
a rudy giuliani somebody who's taken
down the mafia
like you know he doesn't really get
nervous
you know you and i might get nervous but
rudy giuliani isn't going to get nervous
because it's a big event you know he's
been to the show
but he was sweating profusely and i the
moment i saw it
i tweeted that he should get tested
now here's my question for those of you
who have way too much time
on your hands can you find that tweet
can you find my tweet must been during
the pennsylvania
hearing somebody saying in which i said
he looks like he should get tested
and it turns out he was sick he he had
exactly what it looked like
now i feel like i called it just by
looking at him
because as soon as i saw him i thought
to myself
i don't know what the other explanations
would be because the other people don't
look sweaty
doesn't look like it's a hot room why
would it be a hot room in the winter
right the one thing you could make sure
you don't have
is a room that's too hot in the winter
so do it do i get that wind
because i don't know i'm not going to
claim it because i'm i'm not sure if
anybody else was saying the same thing
at the same time
so do me a favor if there's anybody
who's really bored and it's only just
because i'm curious
if anybody diagnosed him before i did
i might have been the first one in the
world literally
at least the one who did it publicly you
know maybe people at home said the same
thing
but i might be the first one in the
world to diagnose him with covet
over the just over tv
which would only be fun not important
so iran is an interesting place lately
and not in a good way um
and there's an interesting thing
timing-wise that apparently just about
exactly the time
that joe biden would take office if he
goes all the way there and becomes sworn
in
just about that time iran will probably
crank up its its enriching of
uranium two levels above where we would
be comfortable
so what exactly is going to happen and
wasn't there a story i didn't see much
follow-up on it so i don't know if it's
even true
was there a story that the supreme
leader
had given some of his or all of his
duties to his son
did you hear that is there is there some
change of leadership going on in iran
i feel as though i saw a story on that
and then i didn't see much about it
so now i'm not sure if it was real could
have been fake news
give me a fact check on that but so
you've got
iran is crumbling so much so
that apparently somebody we don't know
who
i can only guess assassinated
their uh head of their nuclear program
and i don't know if iran will really be
able to
retaliate i just just don't know if they
will
so uh what will biden do with iran
because biden would have to save iran at
this point
you know if if things just go the way
they're going i think iran just
collapses or it looks like it
because they're just going to get picked
away at until there's nothing left
so i'm really curious how biden will
handle
iran and i feel as if there are going to
be a whole bunch of situations
where joe biden will just have to do
pretty much the same thing trump did
they're going to be more and more of
these right and it's going to be funny
as they start rolling out it's like well
okay
biden's going to do very similar things
to what trump did
but we're going to talk about it
differently so you think it's really a
little bit different
and after about the fifth one you see of
those
where you say wait a minute that's
exactly what
trump was doing all you're doing is
changing the words you're using to
describe it because you know that's
coming
that's totally coming on
uh mark levin's show let's talk about
some of the uh best and worst arguments
here
about the election fraud so
mark levine had uh democracy institute
patrick
basham on his program
no relation to christina basham that i
know of
and one of the things he noted is that
there are these indicators
that are very reliable in saying that
if this if this thing happens
the incumbent should win re-election now
if one or two of these things that had
always been predictive in the past
doesn't work out in any given year you'd
say well
it's just one or two things out of many
things
so you wouldn't make too much of this
but his claim is this
and in 2016
that all of these indicators indicated
that trump would win
and he did so in 2016 all those
indicators worked
but in 2020 none of them worked
what are the odds oh i've got an answer
already
somebody says that i tweeted about rudy
giuliani on
november 19th but that would be
it's almost too long right makes you
wonder if he really had coronavirus then
i don't know what else it could be but
maybe that's too long
but anyway so what do you think of the
case
so some of these things are such as if i
remember
one of them is if the incumbent
president gets
20 more votes or even just more votes
if the incumbent gets more votes than
the first time he ran
his odds of winning are like way way
high
and there are a bunch of things like
that if you win this primary
if you have this enthusiasm you know
blah blah blah
now what are the odds that all of those
indicators
worked perfectly in 2016 just the way
they should have
and yet in 2020
all of those indicators stopped working
what's that telling you well the the
implication is it's telling you there
was fraud
because the indicators say trump
definitely was going to win but the
result was that he lost
so what what's that tell you
so i see that most of you in the
comments are saying well that's pretty
good evidence
that there was some fraud right is that
how you interpret it
i hate to tell you this but i don't feel
like that's what's happening here
let me give you another way to interpret
the same thing
here's another way to interpret why
those indicators
all worked in 2016 and they also all
worked
all the time before that but they
stopped working in 2020.
let me give you an alternative reason
that has nothing to do with fraud
a lot of people voted
that's it that's it that's the whole
story
so there are two explanations for why
all
of those indicators would would be
flawed this time
one massive fraud
two it was a weird year a lot of people
voted
i feel as if if things went so
weirdly that one of those indicators got
violated
there's a really good chance they would
all be violated because the one variable
wouldn't violate just one of the
indicators
that one variable of just way more
people voting
and way more people hating trump than
hated him in 2016
or hated him with greater passion or
there was more get out the vote or
something like that
so here's my take if you see something
like this with
all of these indicators stopped working
suddenly
it's definitely a red flag but it might
be
well maybe it's not definitely a red
flag maybe it's a yellow flag
maybe it's a flag that says you should
really be looking
looking a little deeper over here but
let me tell you what it's not
strong evidence of fraud
it's not because if you had one big
variable that just
blew the election you know predictions
out of the water
it would take all of the variables out
at the same time it would only have to
be one thing that's different
and we know there was one thing that was
different gigantic turnout
massive caring
you could get two possibilities now
i've learned from prior experience that
many
of you are binaries there should be a
name for this i'm going to call you
binaries
a binary is somebody who said there
definitely was fraud
or there definitely was no fraud
those are binaries you're picking one of
two possibilities and that's it
it's just one of these it's definitely
this there's definitely that
and you've made up your mind i don't do
that so when you're telling me i'm wrong
you're not even in the right
conversation because i can't be wrong
when i'm saying that you have to apply
odds to things
so if i say there's a 90 chance that
something will happen
and then it doesn't happen was i
wrong no
if i say there's a 90 percent chance of
something happening
and it doesn't happen i'm not wrong
because i said there was a 90 chance 10
still pretty healthy right so
you have to understand that if i
criticize the people who are criticizing
the election or if i criticize
the other side i'm doing the same thing
i'm saying we have to understand this as
a
percentage thing an odds thing and just
don't be a binary about it okay
so there is not what there is not and
i'll i'll
be very certain about this next
statement
it is not true that because those all
those variables were violated only this
one time
it is not true that therefore there is
fraud
it could be true that there's fraud
and it could be true that's exactly the
reason that all those variables
were changed but there is another
explanation
something different was about this
election in every way which was
trump and blah blah
so that one's just keep an eye on it
we'll see
here's another one uh dr craig malkin
tweets today the 48 cases about the
election
irregularities 48 cases counting might
be 49 now he says
where liberal and conservative judges
have tossed out
trump's legal team for lack of evidence
primary documents prove they aren't
arguing fraud
in court da-da-da done
so do you think it's logical to say
now i'm going to go the other way right
so this will be an argument on the other
side
do you think it's logical to say that
because you've lost
prior cases with different evidence
and different claims that you will lose
all future cases that are different
evidence
and different claims there's
it's the dumbest thing i've ever heard
in my life now
the other thing that dr craig malkin may
not understand
is that i don't believe the legal team
was assuming that they would win
these these cases i don't think they
thought they would win
why'd they do it well i suppose you
might win yeah there's always a
possibility
but it feels to me it's more like um
convincing the public that with all this
smoke there must be fire
so if you look at the court cases as
court cases
that's a pretty bad record if you look
at it as
a managing public opinion about the
question of whether fraud happened
home run a flat
out home run and if you think that
the president's attorneys are only
looking at law then you don't understand
anything about the world
they have to look at public opinion too
because even the courts are influenced
by public opinion
so of course the legal team is managing
both
what the public thinks about the
situation at the same time they're
managing the legal technicalities
if they lose on all of the legal
technicalities
49 times in a row but the next poll that
comes out and says
that a gigantic amount of the public
thinks the election was fraudulent
did they lose 49 cases technically
yes because they didn't succeed in court
but i would argue that they won 49 cases
in a row
because because the net effect was
people saying well with all these claims
that's a lot of claims there's got to be
something in this with all these claims
now does it have to be true that with
all this smoke there has to be fire no
no that doesn't have to be true there
could be
tons of smoke and no fire whatsoever
but in terms of persuasion that makes
you think there's there's probably a
fire
let me tell you what uh and somebody
tweeted this today that i didn't write
it down i should have
and it goes like this suppose you
imagine
that uh somehow you're you have
omnipotent
omniscient powers and you know that
fraud did happen
so let's take this just as a mental
exercise you
know it's a fact there's no doubt about
it just for the mental exercise
the fraud happened how many
uh examples of that real fraud would you
expect to find
relative to the number of confirmation
biases
and fake discoveries would you find what
what do you think would be that ratio
if you assumed real fraud happened
and there were just millions of people
lots of millions
involved in voting and counting and
everything so tons of people are
involved
it's complicated it's messy there will
be real mistakes that are just innocent
mistakes
what would you guess would be the number
of
real things even if there's a real thing
there
to the number of fake things where
people are pretty sure they're seeing
this fraud
but maybe they're imagining it because
they just see more than they see i'm
guessing ten to one
ten to one would be my guess yeah they
see somebody else saying that
about ten to one and that would be
predictable
based on the setup it wouldn't matter if
it was an election or anything else
a big complicated thing
once you come to believe that there's
some some mischief
in any big complicated thing you're
going to see
ten times as much what you think is
evidence or even proof
then there is actual real proof that's
completely normal
so if you lose uh
let's say 90 out of 100 court cases
would that be you doing a bad job
probably not maybe that's about what
you'd expect
with these numbers even if there's
there's really something there to find
all right um
here's the dumbest tweet i've seen in a
long time
it doesn't matter who said it just a
twitter user who said
about the virus virus is going to do
virus things and spread like
wait for it a virus and it was in the
context of basically we shouldn't
we shouldn't be treating the virus like
it's a big problem
and i'm thinking to myself you know that
almost sort of made sense
six months ago like if you didn't know
any better
oh six months ago people were saying oh
maybe it's just the flu
but it's not six months ago now
it's not six months ago now
how can you still say that
there's nothing you can do about this
virus because it seems like you could
but we'll talk more about the virus in a
minute let me go over some
some more bad thinking so here's a tweet
i'm a firm believer in occam's razor
uh the simplest explanation is the
correct one
so now this is getting into the michigan
suitcase
situation where people were apparently
sent home and then some counters stayed
behind for hours
counting we'll talk about that more but
somebody's saying the occam's razor the
simplest explanation is that uh
while it's possible that everybody left
on their own
the most likely explanation is that they
were told to leave
but what do you think
we've got a few different versions of
the story about the
michigan uh ballot counters one version
is that only the people opening the
envelopes
were asked to leave and the other people
just saw them leave and they left with
them so the witnesses and the news
people
saw people leaving and they they just
left with them so that's one version
the other version is that the people in
the room were all told that the counting
was done for the night
so they could go home but then the
counting wasn't done for the night
so who's telling the truth who's telling
the truth
well there's an excellent article uh in
the federalist
by molly hemingway who who takes you
through some of the claims
and she looks at what is allegedly the
debunk
and she debunks the debunk basically
does a great job
as molly hemingway always does i would
say
remember i told you i'm going to give
i'm going to give
compliments between now and the end of
the year just because it's the holiday
season
if you're not following molly hemingway
on twitter
you're really missing a lot because she
would be she's probably in like
the top three or top five political
commentators in the country right now
you could argue top one i think so you
should be following her
and but i'm not so sure i agree with it
all it's a really good article
really good take but let me give you my
take all right
we're gonna go to the whiteboard let's
go to the whiteboard
all right see if i can line you up so
you can see this well
here's what i call the dilbert
filter on that michigan ballot counting
situation
now the dilbert filter goes like this
that there are some things you can
depend on in any organization that has a
you know somebody in charge and then a
bunch of people trying to figure out
what they're doing
in other words a business an
organization any kind of group of humans
trying to get something done
there there are some common things that
you'll always
find so let's look at
the room situation as i remember it from
the videos
and if i get any of this wrong feel free
to tell me because i'm not
you know i didn't do the deepest of dive
so maybe i got some stuff wrong here
so if i remember the room there were
these counting stations on
one end i think there were four of them
or were there five
but a limited number and then the claim
is
that there were these other tables where
the ballots were being opened
by people whose only job was to take
them out of the
the envelopes i don't know if they were
checking the signatures but
they were removing them from the
envelopes putting them in containers
and then in some cases they were stored
under tables
which is actually exactly where you
would store things
because putting them in the aisle would
be dumb all right
so the the claim is that the woman with
the blonde braids
came into uh and i think we saw in the
video that she was standing between the
counting stations
and the ballot opening larger body of
work here
and that while facing the cutters
but not facing the counting stations
there are two versions of what this
person said
have you heard both versions
probably not right
somebody says jesus christ man it was
georgia
correct that to georgia um
this is exactly why comments are good
yeah so forget everything i said about
uh michigan
i'm confusing the states so georgia
all right so we're back to georgia
um so super somebody who they thought
maybe was a supervisor who had some
authority
we had blonde locks
said one of two things and it and both
of those two things are being reported
one of the things that's being reported
one of the things that's being reported
is that this person said
the ballot counting is done
everybody can go home now
if that version of the story is true
we've got a big
problem because she's if it's true
that what she said is the ballot
counting is done
you can all go home but
some of the ballot counters stayed
behind and then when
the witnesses were gone at least the
republican witnesses
they kept counting through the night
that would be a pretty big
problem wouldn't you all agree
if it's true that she said
the ballot counting is done go home and
then they counted ballots after the
witnesses left
i think we'd all agree that if that
happened this is a big problem
same page everybody everybody agrees
that would be a big problem
if that is the fact so
i went to look at the witness the
witness statement
because the witness statement presumably
says
that she said the ballot counting is
done
go home isn't that what you've heard
is it isn't everybody reporting in fact
i think in
molly hemingway's article i believe that
there was at least one place
where she says the people said the
ballot counting was done
go home so then i went and looked at the
actual witness statement
and did the witness who was there say
that somebody told them the ballot
counting was done
go home nope
nope if you read the the witness
statement
in the witnesses own words what the
witness says or at least the one that i
saw
was that this person said the work is
done
come back in the morning the work
is done now remember where she's
standing
and remember who she's talking to she's
facing
the envelope cutters and she's saying
hey everybody
the work is done you can go home come
back in the morning you see where i'm
going
she's not even facing the people who are
counters
there are no ballot counters here and
she didn't say the ballot counting was
done
she said to these people whose work was
done
she said hey everybody the work is done
come back in the morning now there's a
question i have which is
was the reason to believe that there
would be more for the cutters to do in
the morning
which is you know a big gap in the story
right did the cutters
believe that there might be more ballots
coming in
after after that night because we've
watched this happen right
ballots are still trickling in even now
right there's still some counting going
on
so was she referring to the fact that
there might be some more to
open in the morning so i would need a
fact check on that was that even a thing
could there be more that needed to be
opened in the morning
and could it be let me give you the
version that if i were defending
you know if i were these people the
count the ones who stayed
and i were going to offer a defense it
would look like this
there were only this many counting
machines and the people who had planned
to remain
knew which was their machine and they
knew that
just the four or five of them would be
enough to do the work
if the four or five of them didn't feel
like having all these people wandering
around and slowing them down and they
were just thinking
innocently there's no reason for
everybody to be here
we don't need any counters we're not
talking to the observers and the
reporters
they're doing their own thing so we're
not even going to talk to observers and
reporters we'll just talk to the
counters the cutters
tell them to go home because they're not
needed
we have exactly the right number of
people for counting
so we'll we'll just work extra hard get
this done
you guys don't need to stay up you can
all go home
now the version the official version
from the state uh
somebody an investigator for the the
secretary of state i think
said that the the witnesses and the
press
simply interpreted your work is done
it's time to go home
and when the cutters started to walk out
the observers and the press said oh
i guess we're done here and so they left
is there is there anybody who says
that anybody told the observers or the
press
the ballot counting is done have you
seen that reporting because i haven't
people are literally literally laughing
in the comments
because that yeah i'm saying that's a
stupid take
so what about the pipe break report
completely different story different
night
the pipe breaking uh so
somebody says the counting has stopped
right
right so the claim here
the claim here is that scott scott scott
somebody said the counting has stopped
why are you ignoring that to which i say
who said that
who said that and who claims somebody
said that
i bet you can't find it we all believe
we've we're all under the impression
that somebody told the room
the counting has stopped but the one
witness
thing that i read under oath he never
said counting
said work and she was talking to the
people whose work was done
all right now here's here's the dilbert
filter on this
in summary the dilbert filter is this
if you take any 10 people in a work
environment
and the supervisor tells those 10 people
some instructions
even simple ones such as if you're done
with this work
come in tomorrow really simple
instruction how many people and of 10
correctly interpret a supervisor
telling 10 people what to do not 10
definitely not 10. suppose you're one of
the uh
you're one of the uh people in the room
and you're the press
and you you're you're sort of semi
paying attention and the supervisor says
to the to the cutters hey everybody your
work is done for the night go home
and then the supervisor or maybe the
press looks at somebody else in the
press or one of the
witnesses and said are we are we closing
up
are we done and then somebody else says
yeah it sounds like
it sounds like the counting is done and
then
somebody asks that press person you know
what's happening i see people leaving
and then that person says yeah the
counting's done
where did the word counting
come from first because i'll bet
the people who were working there use
the word work
the work is done and i'll bet it was
interpreted as
the counting was done that is my theory
but uh is it sketchy looking yes
it is totally sketchy looking did did
people count a lot of ballots without
witnesses yes
so i'm not telling you that that nothing
bad happened
i don't know i'm just telling you that
the way it was reported leaves out the
dilbert filter
which is that people hear hear the same
thing differently
and maybe that's all that happened
don't know i'm very very suspicious
just like all of you are you can't out
suspicious me
right if you're trying to out suspicious
me good luck
cause i'm pretty suspicious i'm just
telling you
that what we have so far or at least
what i've seen
doesn't quite make the case
could be a case hasn't been made all
right
i was listening to uh smirkonish on
sirius yesterday and uh this is one of
my favorite
favorite stories so he was talking about
how the
citizenship test for naturalized
citizens
has been made more difficult all right
so those of you who are good at math
you're gonna you're gonna get ahead of
me
if you're good at math pretend you
pretend you're not good at math just for
a minute
and then i'll let you be good at math in
a little bit
so as smart connoisseurs reported it
used to be that you only had to get
six out of ten questions about the
government
functions to be become a naturalized
citizen in addition to whatever
other things you had to do but you had
to get six out of ten
wrote in a test now the test is from a
body
of study they give you i think there are
128 questions or something
so you have a specific document to study
and out of that whatever 100 and so
questions
they're going to randomly give you 10 of
them and you only have to get six right
in the old the old days but it's being
revised
and as smokonis reports it's becoming
harder now
which doesn't seem fair does it it seems
kind of unfair and
a little bit mean to immigrants to make
this harder
because it went from you have to get six
and a ten
and they they stiffened it so now you
have to get twelve out of twenty
and so murkotis did a whole episode
about
you know what do you think about the
fact
that it went from uh an easy six and a
ten
to this mean old trump administration is
they're stiffening it now it's going to
be 12 out of 20.
okay okay those of you who are good at
math you can be good at math again
yeah so you're allowed to be good at
math again
so now tell me what's wrong with this
yeah that's right
the trump administration tightens the
requirement from you have to get 60
right all the way to you have to get 60
right because 6 out of 10 is 60
and 12 out of 20 is 60
now let me ask you this if you knew that
you were studying a body of 128
questions
and you had to get uh have to pass the
test with 60
right what would you prefer
would you prefer that your test was 6
and a 10
or would you prefer as the test taker
to have a 12 and a 20 well
i'm going to take 12 out of 20 every
time
why because
there might be any of those 100 and so
potential questions that i'm studying
what if the ones i miss happen to be
you know i just happen to miss the wrong
ones
and they happen to be the ones on the
test my odds
of doing a good job are way better if
there are more
questions because remember i studied all
the questions
i didn't study some of the questions
i've studied all of them
so i'd rather have the 12 and a 20
option right
is there anybody who disagrees with that
wouldn't you all rather have 12 out of
20.
so it was an entire story about how
this changed there was another change
that alleges that the questions got
harder which is
separate i don't know that that's true
um
i don't seems to me like it's about the
same all right
um there was a claim that
california and texas had similar covid
trajectory even though they did
completely different stuff
california did a was doing a tight
shutdown and texas is a little looser
and the claim was that they got about
the same result
which took about two minutes for andre's
backhouse
to explain why they were just analyzing
it wrong
per usual every one of these charts
you see on twitter you should give them
no credibility
let me tell you there's probably nothing
less
believable than an official looking
chart on twitter i don't think there's
anything you should trust less than a
graph
even with sources and even if you can
check the sources to be true
there's nothing less useful
than any kind of official looking graph
on twitter they're all
they're all as likely to be
disinformation as to be information and
you can't tell the difference really
so andres explains that this way he says
neglecting what seemingly small but
prolonged differences add up to large
cumulative differences over time saying
that's the problem with it
and he points out that the cases per
million
uh are 36 percent higher
and the deaths are 46 percent higher in
texas
so if you just look at the graph it
looks like they came out about the same
but if you dig a little deeper into the
numbers it turns out
that california is doing tighter
restrictions and having
much better luck does that mean the
masks work and
shutdowns work probably probably does
but there are a lot of differences so
you don't know for sure
uh rasmussen is going to be telling you
this morning that 40
47 of the country thinks
there's a good chance that fraud
happened in the election
47 percent still think that
so um
let's see what else we got here um
sometimes i worry that we don't have a
pandemic problem so much as an
inability to understand risk management
here it looks like we have a virus
problem and if you
if that's your mindset then you know
that
requires you to do a certain set of
things but i feel as if we almost have a
risk management problem you know if
every human being
we're good at risk management i feel as
though the
pandemic would already be over because
people would simply do all the smart
things
that would just we'd be done so it feels
like
stupidity is killing us not the pandemic
let me let me uh let's see if i can find
a bad analogy because all analogies are
bad
um if
we have lots of people drown every year
if lots of people drown every year in
swimming pools and oceans do we have a
water problem
or do we have a problem that maybe
people should learn to swim
or not drink and dive off a diving board
we might not have so much a water
problem
as we have a human being problem they
should do different things and not drown
if it's starting to feel like the
pandemic is really sort of a human
problem
we're just doing dumb things and that's
why we're getting a bad result
now uh now there's also the
wall street journal has now called
 on
the sweden experiment let me ask you
here most of you
watch the news that's why you're here
how many of you think
it is still true that sweden got a good
result
by doing different things how many of
you think that's still true
because the update is the sweden gave up
on their own
technique sweden has now
decided to conform to other countries
you know
stricter shutdowns because sweden itself
says
that their last strategy of being
permissive didn't work
so even sweden says sweden didn't work
and they and therefore they changed it
to be like everybody else
so how many of you still think sweden
worked now it worked in the sense
that they had more freedom for a while
but
it definitely did not work in the sense
that they're getting a better outcome
compared to the alternate way to to
treat it
sweden's becoming like the rest of the
world so
i feel like uh we owe a
debt of gratitude to sweden
because sweden did the thing that should
have happened
intentionally but you can't do this
intentionally because it would be
unethical
which is to handle at least one country
completely differently
because because don't you need to know
all right one country
did it completely differently now we can
track them and see how they did
and that's what they did now of course
they we couldn't have done that
intentionally
because people would say hey people will
die you can't have an experiment like
that
but it happened for good intentions and
now we know
so a great debt of gratitude to the
people of
sweden who sucked it up and maybe we'll
learn something
how about this question as of today
how many of you think uh i'll put the
how many of you you think masks work
and in the comments it'll take a while
for them to catch up how many of you as
of today
you know because we've had lots of time
to see what works and what doesn't
but as of today how many of you believe
masks work and that he has been
demonstrated
beyond a reasonable doubt
and i'm going to read the comments as
they go by nope nope nope
nope nope nope uh so youtube's a little
faster than periscope on the comments
but i'm seeing uh i i saw somewhat
that's the closest to a yes
but people watching this periscope are
almost uh i see one yes
over there i'm saying no no no limited i
say yes
so overwhelmingly
a little more people on periscope say
yes
somebody says define work work
means reducing the spread
all right uh 20 they work if the masks
worked
20 of the time then they work because
that would be
enough to make it worthwhile all right
so isn't that weird to you
no matter whether you think the masks
work or don't work and i'm on the side
that says
it's obvious they work to me it's a
closed question
but uh let me not be binary
i suppose there's some chance that they
don't work
but let me let me ask you this does it
bother you
that there are no doctors on the other
side
as far as i know are there any doctors
saying that masks don't work
and if you were to ask the majority of
doctors
number one do you think they have better
information than you on this topic
most probably yes why do the doctors all
wear masks
do you see any trained medical doctors
or
epidemiologists let's say do you see any
of them
not wearing masks or promoting lack of
mask
wearing now i'm not the guy who says the
experts are always right
but by this time don't you think the
experts know by now
because it doesn't seem like the hardest
thing in the world to test now the thing
that's misleading
is there were all these wrong kinds of
tests done where they see if a virus can
get through the mask
and the virus can get through the mask
but that's the wrong kind of test
because you're not trying to stop all
virus trying to slow it down
that's that's the only point so
uh that's like saying air protects
lives that's not a good analogy
somebody says 20 effectiveness is not
going to affect the spread
yes it would 20 effectiveness of mass
hypothetically would have a gigantic
effect on the spread
it wouldn't stop it would it be pretty
big
doctors that say they don't work are
being censored
by other doctors
[Laughter]
the the only reason that doctors who are
anti-mask
are being censored is because other
doctors are saying that it's not because
you and i are saying that
it's not because the media has an
opinion per se
it's because so many other doctors say
no
somebody says yes there was a huge case
in ontario about
nurses not wearing masks but i don't
know which way that went
surgery isn't normal no so i'm not
making the case
that because uh surgeons wear masks
that therefore masks are good they're
different masks with a different
situation
they're not comparable in the least
um
yeah okay well i just think it's
mind-boggling that that's still a
question
let me put it this way in terms of risk
management it's a no-brainer
it really is in terms of whether you can
be absolutely
positive they work in the way that you
want no you really can't be
absolutely positive of anything these
days but in terms of risk
management the fact that most experts
say they work
that's worth wearing a mask so there's
no question what you should do
even if there's some small question
about whether they work
somebody says masks do work by all
accounts
not by all accounts but certainly by the
majority of
experts the the the people
who fooled you on mass are the ones who
did the test
about whether the masks are too porous
and it just was the wrong question
because if you stop the air flow
and you stop some of the water or if you
even redirect it so it's not going
directly in somebody's face
you're gonna get a different situation
for sure
uh yeah so we're not using surgeons
wearing masks
as any kind of a guide for whether you
should wear a mask as an individual
that's
different
read the box why is it lying the box for
the mask
i don't know how many different ways to
explain this without people
still understanding it let's see if
there's a way to do this
do you all understand i think that the
amount of viral load makes a difference
right
so if somebody were infected and they
they talked for an
hour directly into your open mouth
you would be sicker say the experts
and they seem to be pretty sure about
this you would be sicker because you've
got a ton of viral load it went directly
from a sick person
right into your mouth and it lasted an
hour and man you're going to get some
bad covet
but if you had more of a casual contact
with that same infected person
and you got a little bit of covent you'd
still get the
the virus you'd still be infected but
because it started slowly
and then built up in your system your
own defenses would have a little more
time to kick in
and you wouldn't have as bad a case so
once you understand that the amount
of virus you get makes a big big big
difference
now do you think mass don't work because
at the very least it's going to cut the
amount of direct
air that's going directly into the face
of the person you're talking to
if the only thing it did was distribute
it to the sides and
you know around you instead of cannon
shooting it into the face of the other
person you're talking to
i would think that would release the
viral load and i don't see
any argument that that couldn't happen
now
if you both stayed in the same room and
you're both
wearing masks and you're in a tiny space
and you were you're also close and you
stayed in this tiny space with bad
ventilation
and you stayed there for hours at a time
would the mask
help probably not right
because if you stay there long enough
you're basically going to fill the whole
room with covet
if you stay there long enough so it
wouldn't matter if the virus is coming
out the size or
it wouldn't even matter how fast it's
coming out if you stay there long enough
in the little room
you're going to get plenty of it it's
just that the mask
slows it down that's all that's almost
a certain to work i would say
all right um
let's see uh yeah um
the the other thing that's just blowing
my mind is uh
el you you know alex berenson who's been
uh quite vocal about the efficacy of
masks and lockdowns and stuff and he's
he started out being i would say
what would you call it i would say a
patriotic skeptic
i'm making up a term here so you know
you
you want your alex berensons like you
wouldn't want a world without
that guy because you need the guy who
says oh
wait a minute you know you you say we
should all do something but i'm not
saying the science
you want that guy right you want lots of
that guy you want lots of skeptics
because they're doing it for the right
reasons right good intentions
every every positive uh you know purpose
but sometimes you can be a skeptic
but eventually there's enough
information to
say all right all right i was skeptical
but now
now i'm gonna you know i accept that
there's enough information now and
now we don't have to be skeptical i feel
as though alex berenson is sort of at a
turning point now
where he's going to have to re-examine
his skepticism on at least masks
and maybe more so we'll see we'll see if
that happens
and again um
if a skeptic is claiming there's no
evidence and making a big deal about it
and then later is shown that you know
maybe they're
they're not right that's not really
wrong
right because if somebody's complaining
there's not evidence and there wasn't
at least good enough evidence that's
still true
if later you find out it worked that's
just new information
all right somebody says studies are now
showing there's little spread in
closed work environments i don't
i don't trust any of those studies
i suppose if you get enough
if masks are effective why are there
spikes and infections
everywhere well the people who are
pro-mask will tell you that's
that's just not true they will tell you
that it is clear as day
and there's current evidence to show
that when there are masks
there is less infection than where there
are no masks
so i guess you can pick and choose your
studies
okay please stop sending me comments
about how the good masks
used for surgery are a different
situation because nobody's talking about
that
right there's nobody involved in this
conversation
who thinks that the surgical masks and
that and that application has
you know should be useful in this
conversation
um somebody says hand washing is the key
i don't think so
i think that we thought hand washing was
the key before
but it turns out that you don't have to
you know
wash with soap your bags of delivered
food or anything
what about vitamin d and zinc
i read a story today that said that if
you don't have enough magnesium i think
joshua lusic was tweeting that that if
you don't have enough magnesium in your
body which is pretty common a lot of
people don't
that you don't take advantage of your
vitamin d
the way you could if you had magnesium
so i'm gonna i'm gonna look into
supplementing with magnesium
if it if i can confirm that it has a
role
in making your vitamin d more effective
so i'm gonna look into that if anybody
has some ideas on that let me know
but let me know is magnesium something
people should have just in general
just general health are we low on it
is it a good idea to take it but then on
top of that does it help my vitamin d
become more effective
so i'll look into that
i'm seeing 40 say they will not take the
vaccine
i don't believe that number i believe 40
said it i believe that once people start
getting the vaccine
the amount of peer pressure will be
just enormous so i don't think it will
be 40
watch out for the snake oil salesman
yeah supplements
are something that i'm really really
skeptical of just in general
um all right you need oh you and you
need a
k so you do k
is it vitamin k all right that's all i
need for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
all right periscope's gone youtube
you're still with me
uh
somebody says is mass and social
distance and
worth it if we lose our humanity
well we certainly have to balance
economics
with that you know i'm generally not
concerned about the
long-term implications of short-term
actions
if we know they're short-term
uh
all right that's a bad joke i'm not
going to repeat
uh
somebody says epidemiologists say that
cloth mass
will spread will slow the spread but not
stop the total number eventually
affected
false false if epidemiologists say that
then you should stop listening to them
here's what they should say
if cloth masks slow the spread
and you've got a vaccine coming wear a
cloth mask
because slowing it makes sense
you know in a world in which you've got
a vaccine coming
slowing it is less useful in a world in
which you're all going to get it
eventually
you know it's still useful to slow it
but it's not not the same equation
uh why were the ballots under the table
where would you put them
if you've ever been a caterer you know
that's where you store things under the
table
and you saw that all the tables were
cleaned on the top
and they stored things under the table
which is where i would put them
i would put them under the table um
dominion miscounted in georgia i think
did they i think that was debunked
wasn't it
uh why does a huge spike for biden in
the end of the night correlate perfectly
with the tape because that's when they
counted
a lot of votes really efficiently
that's why once everybody was left and
everything was opened
the last four people said we're going
gonna crash through this
as fast as possible and go home
everything's ready for us we'll just run
them through
so there should have been a huge spike
in
uh votes and if most of those votes were
from a region that voted for biden
then most of them would be forbidden and
there would be a big spike at the end of
the night
i'll tell you what would be more unusual
wouldn't it be more unusual if there
were not
a big spike at the end of the night
because wouldn't that
suggest people were hurrying up to you
know
to get home and they there was a
learning curve
wouldn't you expect that you would have
the slowest ballot counting in the
beginning of the night
because everybody's new and you get all
the bad ballots and they haven't been
corrected
by the end of the night let me give you
another scenario
i'm not saying this happened because
there's no evidence that happened
but just somebody asked the question how
could there possibly be a big spike
for biden votes at the end of the night
and it'd be normal
i'll give you a scenario just
to tell you that your imagination might
be limiting you
doesn't mean this happened suppose the
voting
process was this that the problem
ballots that don't go through the
counting machine they're folded or bent
or whatever
they all go to a room for correction in
the correcting room
while witnesses are watching so there's
no funny business
a clean a clean ballot is taken with no
entries
and they look at the one that's damaged
and they simply
write the same entries on the clean one
so that they'll have a clean one to go
through the machine for counting
now as long as it's witnessed by the
right witnesses
there's nothing wrong with that it's the
same ballot they're just transferring it
onto a clean one
now you're the you're the one who's
doing the corrections in the correcting
room and there's a lot of correcting
because they're all folded ballots you
know
it's a it's a messy system so now you've
got this big
bunch of corrected ballots
when do you give them to the counters
are you giving each corrected ballot
as you correct it all right here's one
take it to the other room
or do you process all of them in your
own little room
and then when you're done at the end of
the night because you wouldn't do it
before that
you gotta you know if you're correcting
ballots you're gonna wait to the end of
the night to make sure you got them all
at the end of the night you take your
buckets full of your corrected ballots
you put it on top of the ones that were
going to get counted anyway
and then people are faster accounting
because they figured out how to do it
better there's a learning curve
nobody's asking the questions the
witnesses went away there's nobody to
slow them down
and it's the best counters that stayed
late because the bad counters
who were very not very efficient got
sent home you
you could think you could think of easy
reasons
why very naturally and for no funny
business
there was a big spike at the end of the
day now if it turned out that 98
of that spike was for biden well that's
close to impossible
so that would be that would be a problem
but there shouldn't be a problem
with the fact that there was a spike at
the end of the night
the problem should be the percentage
within the spike
if there's a problem
and what if you got a big bunch of
marxists doing the correcting
same thing i guess so all i'm trying to
tell you
is that uh i join you in your skepticism
that this was a clean vote
i join you in your skepticism that
whatever was going
on in that room need some
answers and more answers than we've
heard so far
but the only thing i'm adding to it is
there could be
completely legitimate reasons for
everything you saw there could be
