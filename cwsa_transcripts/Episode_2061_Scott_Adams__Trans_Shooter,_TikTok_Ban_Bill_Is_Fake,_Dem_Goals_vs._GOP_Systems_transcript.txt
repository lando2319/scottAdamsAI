to do
good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams the best thing
that's ever happened to you
I don't know what's wrong with my voice
today
what's wrong with my voice today
well we'll work that out and we'll work
out everything else that's important
it's all going to happen today you will
get reframed and excited and stimulated
in ways you didn't even think possible
and all you need for that is a cup of my
girl glass of tanker Chelsea style a
canteen jogger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamines
of the day you think makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous Sip
and it's going to happen now
go
oh that's good that's some good stuff
there
all right well let's look at all the
news
um
I heard that Elon Musk says that Twitter
might be on a a fast lane to bankruptcy
but that doesn't mean Twitter would go
away I always have to remind people when
they hear anything about bankruptcy
bankruptcy means the courts give you
some
let's say relief with creditors meaning
that you don't have to pay them right
away necessarily so that you can stay in
business
so I wouldn't be surprised but it
wouldn't it wouldn't affect whether
Twitter stays in business
um so I guess the blue check people will
lose their blue checks on Twitter
unless they buy it and already somebody
who bought a blue check is impersonating
Monica Lewinsky
so apparently the blue check will not no
longer work as a way to know if
somebody's the real thing
so in theory there should be a whole
bunch of impersonators of me
in a week
there'll be a whole bunch of racist
looking impersonators of me can't wait
can't wait for that
probably already making their accounts
so I don't know what is the right answer
I do think that everybody who has a blue
check probably needs to be paying for it
I mean that's not crazy
and I think that Twitter is better as a
subscription service
because if you're not willing to pay a
few bucks a month
maybe you're not thinking it's adding
value to you or you're adding value to
it
so I think musk is on the right track
and I think that losing his advertising
Revenue which apparently he did 70 of it
or something
maybe that was good
because I'm not sure I would trust
or want to be at the system that you
know no no friction of getting on there
or getting off
all right here's a disturbing story Matt
TYB journalist who was a testified in
Congress about the Twitter files and all
that apparently the IRS visited his
house
the same day he was testifying in
Congress
it was a surprise visit there was no
announcement
the IRS agents just showed up showed up
at his door
now
I can't in a million years you never
convinced me that was anything but a
political intimidation
it was political intimidation right
now I guess Jim Jordan representative
Jordan was asked the IRS to explain
themselves and Matt taibi has wisely
said he's not going to comment
until the Jim Jordan letter gets a
response so he doesn't appear to owe any
money
in fact he thinks the government owes
him money a lot of money
so it looks like it was just political
oh my God
I mean I don't know what could be
scarier than that it couldn't possibly
be a coincidence is it
doesn't feel like it
but that's just jaw dropping so there's
your problem the government is being
weaponized against the public it looks
like it now remember we're in the Fargo
war on the story so the odds of this
story turning into something different
in the next days or years are pretty
good
so I wouldn't I wouldn't bet you know
what's happening yet
so far we probably don't know what's
happening
but scary
well of course there was another mass
shooting at a school and I usually don't
talk about these because I don't like to
give them attention
but the interesting thing about this if
I could call it interesting given that
it's more tragedy than the news
um
is that the shooter was trans
now if ever there was a story
that was made for the headlines
it's mass shooting
children victims as well as adults
and a trans activist
this has I don't know if it was an
activist this has everything
but you have to look at the way the the
various news sites are covering it
when I heard the story I heard it was a
female trans
and so I didn't know what I was dealing
with
because I don't what does that mean
does that mean you were born female and
transitioned to male or does it mean you
were born male and transitioned to
female so when I hear female trans I'm
like that's not even the turn
I don't even know what that means
so
here's what I think I know
when I look when I look at Fox News
cover coverage they refer to the shooter
as she
she but the but the shooter has he and
him pronouns
so is Fox News in trouble for referring
to somebody with he and him pronouns
who transitioned I guess as a shape
I don't know what are the rules so I
went over to CNN to see how they were
handling it do you know how CNN handled
it
never mention gender
no pronouns
the shooter did this then the shooter
did that and then the shooter did this
yep I think they said at some point the
shooter is trans
but
they just like stayed out of the whole
thing the shooter
yeah
now do you think that the uh the trans
element of the story is why the shooting
happened
we don't know we'd just be guessing
I'm guessing no
actually
some of you guess yes I mean we're just
guessing because we don't know I'm
guessing though
but I could easily be talked into yes
so it was a student yeah
so how many of you think this is a story
of uh mental illness as opposed to a
story about guns
to me it looks like mental illness
I mean I I think you have to be mentally
ill to go shoot up a school
so kind of by definition
all right and so I don't want to talk
about that too much uh except that oh my
God it was just made for TV news we hear
a lot about this
well I saw
um yet another Democrat Rachel Maddow
saying some version of no one is a is
above the law talk about Trump
now
what is that when somebody says no one
is above the law
what is that
what would you call that
it does sound like what an NPC says but
it's actually persuasion it's making you
think past the sale did you know that
if you're talking about
whether somebody is above the law you've
already decided that they're guilty
that's what that means
I've decided they're guilty
so if they're not already in jail well
maybe you're acting like they're Above
the Law or something
right so never fall for the above the
law thing
that's just somebody trying to say
they're guilty without using the words
that are guilty
and
it never is on point
it's never on point when you're talking
about you know Trump's legal situations
does does anybody say he's above the law
does anybody say that a law should not
be
you know prosecuted nobody says that but
the Democrats act like there's some
argument with imaginary people who think
that some people should not be
prosecuted
now here's what else is wrong with that
nobody's above the law
but also nobody is below the law
right if there are trumped-up charges no
pun intended
should you be sent to jail because
you're not above the law
if the if the charges are BS
I mean that's where people are acting
like is like even if even if the charges
aren't real
oh you're not above the law though
how about the facts are we above the
facts
or equal to the facts I guess
yeah so it's never about being Above the
Law it's always about uh you know an
imaginary crime that didn't in many
cases is a crap and it didn't happen
so is nobody's Above the Law does that
apply to a crime that didn't happen
or a person who wasn't guilty
but the demons will make it look like it
is
um
and then of course there's a whole class
of of laws that could be broken and even
the prosecutor believes it's not worth
pursuing
what's that that's not somebody being
above the law
that's about the law that was broken is
too trivial to be worth the the effort
so I think you know Trump falls into a
few of those categories but whatever
year there's no one is above the law
that is pure partisan
uh BS
so here's my bottom line on Democrats
versus Republicans now of course there
are no absolutes
and there are no there's no such thing
as all Democrats being alike or all
Republicans being alike that's not a
thing so it's just a generalization but
I think it holds as a generalization
that Democrats like Grievances and goals
Grievances and goals uh I have a
grievance
and my goal is equity I have a grievance
and my goal is reparations
that sort of thing
whereas uh Republicans are far more
likely to talk in terms of systems
like the free market system traditional
family systems religion as a system the
Constitution
basically systems now of course
Democrats also you know look at systems
and talk about it and of course
Republicans have goals but there's a
really clear distinction in emphasis
and I see the Republicans
default
two systems like okay if not everybody
could have everything but at least we
could have a system that makes you feel
like you were treated
fairly in terms of opportunity
it's the best you can do it's a good
system and the Democrats have this
completely irrational view that you can
go right to the goal
give me money and that were Equitable
hey it's pretty simple you have money I
don't have money that's not Equitable
give me some of your money so that's not
really a system
it's just like going right to the goal
and I would argue that when they do have
something that looks like a system it's
destructive
such as CRT
a critical race Theory
is about elise's Roots we're in getting
rid of the family structure and getting
rid of anything that's supported the
civilization the way it was basically
because it all needed to be ripped up
because there's all systemic racism
so I saw a psychologist
a video clip who was saying that
grieving grievance based
philosophies lead to violence
so if your filter on life is grievance
you're far more likely to do something
violent does that make sense
kind of makes sense right if you're not
super unhappy about other people
you're probably not going to get a gun
and shoot other people
you have to think there's something
wrong externally and it's affecting you
in order to go kill that external stuff
so yes I would say that critical race
Theory pretty much guarantees that some
number of people who go through that
training
will have grievance based
violent actions
so I do think CRT creates violence
what do you think
I think I think you agree
all right
Utah has put on some kind of limits for
social media for kids I didn't even know
that was possible
did you know that a state can put a
limit on social media so I guess the
social media companies will be required
if the if the person signing up is in
Utah
that if you're under 18 you have to have
permission from parents to have an
accountant
I like that
you also need to be able to prove you
are who you are you can't just lie and
say you're 18 I guess
and you won't be able to show children
ads
and won't be able to use it between 10
30 pm and 6 30 A.M
I like all of those I like all of those
it would have been you know maybe I
would have preferred it
If the parents didn't have to decide on
social media rather was just banned
so the children because the parents were
kind of helpless
if you say it's up to the parents
whether the kids get social media then
95 percent of kids love social media I
don't think that's what they were trying
for
I think they're trying to get that
number down but just having to ask
parents won't work because the kids will
just badge at the parents until the
parents say yes
yeah
yeah well but it's good I like the
states
trying something
well uh Dr Carlson
um illuminated the question of The Tick
Tock ban
I was under the impression that Congress
was considering a ban on tick tock
turns out that's just a lie
they were considering a power grab over
all social media
and then they would use it for tick tock
now not acceptable
not acceptable
if I had a choice of a tick tock band
or new powers over all of social media I
would rather have Tick Tock stay in
business as dangerous as it is
but no I do not agree with the and and
maybe it's a poison pill
it could be
the Congress or at least the Democrats
really do not want Tick-Tock banned but
they can't argue it because it makes it
look like they have something you know
personal in it and they probably do
because personally it could help them
get elected
Etc
so I've got a feeling that your
government is pretending to argue about
Tick Tock but really
it's just a power grab over social media
and I don't support it at all here's
what I support a bill targeted at Tick
Tock only or whatever it becomes right
give me a tick tock only Bill and I will
promote the heck out of it but this
general power grab over social media
absolutely not
absolutely not
that is no no no no no no no
if there's any Republicans vote for that
they're going to have a lot of
explaining
so it could be that the Democrats sort
of lured the Republicans into a trap by
saying yeah yeah let's all get together
and do some bipartisan work on Banning
Tick Tock and I've got an idea why don't
we not limited to tick tock huh
every part of this is wrong and creepy
I hope they don't get away with it
well the probe
into the Stormy Daniels things is now
brought into
uh the mix an ally of President Trump
his name is David Becker
so has John Thomas Thompson and John
Thompson tweeted uh pecker enters
pecker becomes part of the probe
so I don't think you could have a Stormy
Daniels story without
pecker being part of the probe
that's all the pecker is part of the
probe
all right that was important
do you remember when uh
Joe Biden
said that if you elect him you'd finally
have an honest president
finally we could have a president who
doesn't lie to us like that evil orange
Menace
well how's that working out
um as Dan Crenshaw said when he was
reacting to Biden's State of the Union
quote the president has devolved into
just lying shamelessly about GOP
positions to frighten senior citizens
into voting for him
and that's what he's doing he's
literally just making stuff up now
and Biden's saying that the Border
problem uh all the number of Crossings
is because of trump
I don't have to read that story
he's literally just saying that whatever
the Democrats did they didn't do it was
the Republicans and the news the news is
so
segmented
that his base won't know the difference
he could actually say anything
this base will never be exposed to the
other argument
it's amazing
so let's see how many people in a recent
Rasmussen poll
say how many how many people would agree
with the statement
um
that uh crenshaws how many would agree
with the crenshaw's statement that Biden
is just lying about stuff
turns out 56 percent of Voters agree
with the statement that Biden is just
lying about stuff now that means a lot
of Democrats that's a lot of Democrats
joined you know pretty much all the
Republicans saying that their own
president uh is just making stuff up
he's just making stuff up
let's see how many think how many people
would
do you think would strongly disagree
with the idea that Biden is lying
how many would strongly disagree
oh there it is 25 25 you're very good
guessers 25 say no no Biden lying are
you kidding me
I thought Sandy by the lying going on
maybe you're the liar maybe you're the
liar if you say Biden's lying ah
how about that
all right
I was trying to think which of uh
Trump's twenty thousand lies made any
difference at all
what do you think
did any of Trump's lies during office
now January 6 and the election I'm going
to talk about
but if you don't count the election in
January 6 is there anything he lied
about that made any difference
because typically it was Hyperbole and
it was just in service of some policy
that you liked
if you're if you're a Republican
now
here's the thing I don't think Trump
lied about the election I think he
believed what he was saying and it was
not accurate in a number of cases but I
believe he actually believed the
election was stolen he acts like
somebody who believes it I mean I can't
read his mind don't know but he looks
and acts like somebody who really
believed it is that lying or is that
just being wrong if he's wrong we don't
even know if he's wrong
yeah so
I would argue that nothing that
um
Trump said made any difference
whether it was accurate or not
I don't know if that'll be true with
that with Lion Biden now maybe his lies
won't make any difference either we'll
see
well Florida voted
um and and Ron DeSantis signed the bill
do you give all Florida families school
choice
how big a deal is that
how many how many is that the only state
with universal school choice
how many states have that now
six total somebody had that answer right
away six or seven
good
a lot of this I wonder how much is Corey
DeAngelis just going around and just
you know working on this issue full-time
he seems to be super effective
I don't think it's a coincidence that
his work is correlating with all these
changes
very interesting
I'd love to know how he gets paid
wouldn't you
who pays Corey D'Angelo
I don't know
but he's doing stuff that I want him to
do so I guess I don't care who pays him
um
all right so then we'll see how school
choice Works in Florida it's a good good
experiment
so Biden is still referring to
Republicans as extreme Mega Republicans
is that good persuasion
do you think it works to say extreme
Mega Republicans
unfortunately I think it does
yeah you're going to say no because
maybe it doesn't work on you
but I think it does if you just keep
saying it over and over again people are
going to be oh he's extreme now that's
what uh newt
did right
do you remember Newt Gingrich I think he
was the one who kept saying you know
extreme liberal
extreme liberals those liberals I think
that worked no you don't you think that
the right sort of rallied against the
extreme liberals so extreme I think that
extreme thing actually works politically
because nobody wants to think they're
extreme
well I'm sure somebody does but but the
average voter doesn't want it to be
involved with anything extreme
extreme
take that away from me I want ordinary
don't give me extreme
yeah unfortunately it works I think
here's a statistic I saw that
um
I guess I just need to check this
is it true that 21 and the 22 major
cities in America run by black elected
officials
is that true
21 out of the 22 biggest cities are run
by black elected officials
I know that surprised me
I would have thought it'd be more like
half of that
but 21 out of 22.
does that suggest
um that diversity was more important
than Effectiveness because the cities
are pretty much a mess
it feels like diversity hiring doesn't
it
with the incompetence that you'd expect
from that yeah now I don't I don't say
I'd expect that because the people who
got hired are black I say that as soon
as you focus on diversity instead of
capability you you limit the pool of
applicants and therefore logically based
on math
you would have fewer chances of getting
the right person
so it looks to me like the cities are
destroyed by diversity
or or response to diversity
is that fair
this is what it looks like
that's what it looks like
there's no way to know for sure but it
has all the all the markings of
Destruction by diversity
yeah
so I would say get away from the inner
cities as far as you can
but you already knew that
all right
um
how do you ignore the fact
now are we at a point where we can say
that uh the goal of diversity and Dei
and CRT have created a level of
incompetence in the country both in the
government and Private Industry that is
now
too much to support the system
I feel like our basic
let's say adherence to capability and
Merit have all Fallen away
in theory companies should be failing
from diversity
and again not because the candidates
would be lower quality but as soon as
you start favoring diversity there are
fewer people to pick
and everybody's gonna be trying to pick
those same few people who are just
perfect for the job
so in theory you should end up with
lower quality employees
and the whole system should fall apart
over time
and is that why the young people see no
future because they don't see any
competence being
applied to anything that's future for
oriented
where though
took away the job of the black mayor
okay
well I do think that we have a
a confidence crisis
and we have a population crisis
and it all seems to be coming from the
same place doesn't it
so there's an anti-white anti-family
set of beliefs that have taken over
and those will drive you to more racial
Division and less competence necessarily
again it has nothing to do with the
individuals and their capabilities it's
just if you're looking at a smaller pool
of applicants
it's just math you're going to get worse
employees
there's no way around that
so
um yeah competence is no longer part of
the job
guess who made this happen you say
well it's not one person
what can we do before it's too late you
know I've been spending a lot of
thinking about that
and
I think we need to let the cities
deteriorate deteriorate into
basically prison cities
and just stay away from them and build
build new cities with like a-minded
people and new communities with
like-minded people so I think you just
have to escape that which can't be fixed
I think the inner cities can't be fixed
I don't see any hope for that
let it yeah I would just let it go I'll
just let the cities deteriorate I
wouldn't give them any money I wouldn't
do anything I just let them go
but I don't have a better idea
you know definitely don't have a better
idea I wish I did
San Francisco is gone yeah
you can imagine snake Adams
the I don't know why I remember
uh that it was snake snake pliskin
escaped from New York why do I remember
the the hero's name in that movie of all
of all movies I don't typically remember
the name of the the hero of a movie
all right
uh Escape From New York yeah
optimism is natural and pessimism is
taught I don't know
I think optimism is natural too
but you can learn to speak in optimistic
tones so you can teach yourself to act
like an optimist
extra special guilt at the SG that's not
bad
all right that's all I had for you today
not a lot of news did I did I leave
anything out
they forget anything
what did I forget
is the Golden Age gone
well
um I don't know if you'd notice but
there's a lot going right at the moment
there's a lot going right
it's easy to lose that when everything's
going wrong now ai is a result of a wild
card AI will either be good or bad I
don't know
um
but here's what's good
so what's good is employment is still
high
that's good
I don't think we're any closer to
nuclear war
I don't think that's going to happen I
think that we're divesting from China
that's good
I think the odds of a Republican
president are high coming up I think
that
the borders of mass
but it happens to be a mess at the time
when our population is declining
sort of a mixed situation there
um
so I don't know we got out of
Afghanistan
there are some things going right but
inflation is the macro thing going wrong
so I think banks will be okay
I think banks will be okay
I just think inflation will just keep
chipping at us
yeah I I mean I'll lose maybe a third of
my net wealth to
um
just to inflation
what do you think do you think you'll
lose a third of your net wealth to
inflation
yeah we all will right should be the
same for everybody yeah about a third
now if most of your net wealth is in
your house and your house doesn't go
down in value then you're in good shape
but if you just have
um
well are you
know but if you own stocks and the
stocks get killed by inflation
you're all in the same boat
with Jimmy Dore make a good president no
that's all I'll say about that no no
well people pull money from Banks to see
higher returns
probably
but I think we'll figure out a way to
keep the banks alive
yeah food prices are crazy
if we switch to a digital currency well
here's the problem
do you know why it took so long for
um some kind of background check system
for illegal immigrant hiring
I don't know the answer but I think that
the government knows
that if
if all the illegal immigrants were taken
out of the businesses that they're
working for that the economy would
collapse in some places
so I think I think there's sort of a
turning the other way about illegal
employees
because it's just easier to to have
illegal employees because those jobs
were not getting filled by anybody else
so
uh there are some problems that people
don't try to fix they just act like they
are
yeah so here's what here's the problem
if you introduce the digital currency
than people who cheated on their taxes
wouldn't be able to do it
so your your server at your restaurant
would have to claim all of their taxes
because the government would presumably
see the transactions
and
that would destroy you know the
restaurant business would end basically
all right
national sales or vat tax Maybe
yeah how do you sell your car well you
sell it with digital currency use your
app and sell your car
do I prep I mean for the end of the
world now just I just do some basic
stuff
Vivek in Tulsi
yeah I don't see that
I don't see that
would we even need Banks if we had
digital currency no
you know banking banking only exists the
way it does because Banks can bribe
politicians to keep things the way they
are
we're at a point where one app you
should do all your banking for free you
know for eight dollars a month for the
app or whatever
yeah you should just have one app that
does all your banking did it ever make
sense
that you would have two different
accounts
a checking account and a savings account
how did that ever make sense it never
made sense
you should just have money
you just put money in the bank and if
you have money in the bank they pay you
interest
and if you take a loan for more money
than you have in the bank you pay them
interest that's it
that should be the whole story
you could also Imagine a world where
your loan application is evaluated by
your neighbors
you could have the app you know asked
all the questions and then talk to the
neighbors
and the neighbors would be like no
that's a known scammer there
I'll just throwing out some ideas but
now uh banks are obsolete
there's no reason for a bank
but they will remain for a long time
because they can bribe politicians to
stay in business put up walls against
competition
[Music]
um
uh I see him off today am I tired or
depressed well I got up at
12 30 A.M
and
I fell asleep for a minute and got up at
2 30.
in racked in pain as I wake up in pain
every day part of the reason that I have
trouble sleeping is it's painful it
hurts
does anybody else have that
the longer I stay in bed the more it
hurts
my body starts itching my back hurts
it just all hurts
so I have to get out of bed
so uh at 3 30 I I just called the game
and said all right I'm not asleep
anymore so at 3 30 I got up
that's probably what you hear in my
voice
Senior Living yeah maybe no I uh I
overdosed on coffee yesterday I know
exactly what I did to myself it was just
coffee
yeah age is part of it for sure
no I've tried every mattress they're all
the same
I mean I've really tried every mattress
it's this has been in my whole life so
the the screaming pain when I wake up
is not because of my age that's just
always been there
it takes about
it takes about 15 minutes before the
pain goes away
so I I don't like getting up and I don't
like sleeping my two least favorite
things
it's diet I don't think so
yeah it's all lower back
um
transcranial devices I don't have a
problem getting to sleep
it's just that when I wake up I'm done
sleeping
start eating me
why is it that no matter what is going
wrong with me somebody will say I should
eat meat like no matter what it is
n't me
all right
uh do I have a childhood injury no
no and my back doesn't hurt
most of the day
it just hurts when I sleep and when I
get up
sleeping in a chair yes I sleep in my
massage chair sometimes but I but for
some reason since she can't move around
to different positions in a massage
chair you can only stay there for like
an hour
all right that's enough about this
enough about me
enough about me elevated my knees my God
that sounds
sexual all right bye YouTube I'm going
to talk to the lovely people on locals a
little extra
and don't you wish you subscribed over
