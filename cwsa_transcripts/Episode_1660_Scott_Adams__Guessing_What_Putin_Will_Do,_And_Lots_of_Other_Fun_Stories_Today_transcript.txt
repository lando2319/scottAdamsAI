good morning everybody and welcome
to the finest moment of your entire
existence
it's called the beginning of coffee with
scott adams there's no better time and
nothing
could be more important
and this is where we decide all world
events uh you don't know this but a lot
of the simulation is authored right here
by us
so let's go author us up a a better
world but first we'll need a little
fortification a little thing we call
caffeine
or possibly the beverage of your choice
and all you need is a cup of mug or a
glass of tanker chelsea signed a canteen
sugar flask and vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day
thing makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
famous across the world
especially in south africa
where i believe there are some people
watching right now
i think it's 5 p.m
so to my south african uh viewers this
one's for you and also for everybody
else go
ah
yeah yeah
yeah that's good
just as good as i thought it would be
well what's happening today
lots of things
um
an msnbc reporter
was just on the air recently
saying that it's going to be tough to
get democrats to unmask
even as the governors are
starting to be in favor of it the blue
states and even as the science
is clearly indicating that masks
have you know
vanishingly small benefit at this point
so
what's the problem with the democrats
the actual voters and the citizens who
don't want to give up masks well this
msnbc reporter says
he thinks it has to do with a liberal
identity
that once your identity gets wrapped up
in mask wearing like the masked people
are the good people
and you want to be the good people
and i would say that this msnbc reporter
probably is right this does look like an
identity problem
now
do you remember how the democrats always
follow the science
oh not you republicans
no
[Music]
no
no
only democrats can follow the science
so where did they follow it
if they were following the science
wouldn't they take their mask off
because science just said it's okay
i'm pretty sure i mean
i don't think i don't think the cdc has
said it yet
but
the science is pretty clear i mean at
this point if your omicron is 100 of the
infections which i think it is i think
omicron is now basically a hundred
percent the variance within omicron
so i think this proves that the
democrats were never following the
science
can i say that
if democrats won't take their masks off
when the science changes
that's proof
right that's proof that they weren't
following the science from the beginning
they were following their fear
and they were following their identity
and
it turns out their fear and their
identity took them to the same place
surprised
um
here's a mystery that was solved
that apparently was already solved
but it's more solved than it was uh
apparently we have a pretty good idea
who is behind q
now now it's the same names that have
been
bandied about for a long time so a lot
of people thought that these individuals
paul ferber a south african software
developer
and ron watkins american
tech guy also i think
and they were long rumored to be the
ones behind cue they they both deny it
but the new york times has a story about
a
a software
analysis of the writing styles
so they analyzed their writing styles of
queue
compared it to the tweets that we know
about from those two individuals and
they say they could even identify when
one of them left and the other took over
so i guess the
the fingerprint as you if you will the
fingerprint of how you write
is so clear that they can't even tell
when the transition happened
now do you believe it
how many of you believe that let's say
if somebody tweeted enough on their own
you could identify their writing in
another context
i'm saying almost all knows
interesting few yeses
but on the locals platform almost all
are saying no what about you uh youtubes
youtubers
i see probably is
more yeses why is that oh now now we're
changing to more yeses on locals
all right let me give you my opinion as
a professional writer
i'll tell you one of the things that
i've been doing for um
30 years i guess
since the dawn of email when
i first started publishing dilbert a few
years into it i got started getting a
thousand emails a day or something from
from fans
and i would read them quickly but i'd
try to read them all actually and
i would guess before i saw the name
so i wouldn't know who the email was
from just some random fan
i would guess the gender
based on how the letter was written
and i found that i could guess the
gender
just with uncanny accuracy
you know well over 90 of the time you
can guess the gender just by reading it
did you know that
now this is anecdotal i didn't you know
i didn't go through a rigorous
scientific process but i think it's
actually pretty easy
to identify gender
now this is in the context of somebody
voluntarily writing something in which
they're not trying to hide their gender
right so if they're voluntarily writing
something it's just easy you just see it
in the writing
now
can you take that further
and identify an individual
and i will tell you from all of my
experience as a writer
yes
yes do you know why i don't have a
ghostwriter for dilbert
anybody
does anybody know why after all these
years when i could easily
easily hire a writer and hire another
artist and then just go vacation all day
and never write dilbert again
so why do i do it
the reason is there's literally no one
else who can do it
literally
if somebody else could write in my style
they would have already done it there
would already be you know some other
comic called dilbert just
you know drawn differently
but you really can't write in the style
of other people
what about shakespeare well i guess
there's some people think that that
might have been a group effort that's a
bad example but take take whoever is
your best writer in the world whoever
you think that is
um
uh who wrote harry potter
oh i can never i i blank on that
author's name all the time the harry
potter or jk rowlings
in my humble opinion
jk rowlings is one of the best writers
of all time not just successful
obviously but just in terms of being
able to form a sentence
oh my god
that woman can form a sentence like just
crazy
peggy noonan
peggy noonan another great example of
somebody who's not just successful
but oh my god can write a sentence that
you just will read over and over again
if somebody can write a sentence that
you'll read more than once
like you'll stop at the end of the
sentence and say i gotta do that one
again and you go to the beginning of the
sentence just just to read it again
like that those two writers i mentioned
can do that george will another one yeah
so
you really can't reproduce other
people's writing
you think you can
because you think oh i'll do an
impression yeah you think you could do
an impression of trump's writing i'll
bet you can't
i'll bet you can't now i'm not going to
say you couldn't in a limited case
you definitely could
write one tweet
that looked exactly like
a trump tweet you could definitely do
that
but you couldn't do a body of work
that looked just like trump you just
couldn't do it it's not doable
and
i i think it's as distinct as a
fingerprint
so while the two names of the cue
alleged
hugh
writers uh were known for a long time
this analysis seemed to confirm it
so there you go somebody says any cia
agent well we do not know
if either these people have any
connections to any intelligence agencies
that i'd say that is not in evidence
let's talk about ukraine
do you think anybody knows anything
about ukraine
you know yesterday i got i got a few
comments from people who knew what they
were talking about
you know who understand world politics
and russia stuff better than i do which
is a lot of people
and they had comments along the lines of
uh people like me should stay out of it
because boomers are stupid and we don't
know what's going on and you know nobody
understands putin like like they do i
guess
and i realized
that
my comments on russia are misleading
and i feel like i need to confess
something publicly
do you want is anybody ready for a
confession
and it goes like this
when i talk about a topic on these live
streams and when i'm tweeting
i like to
i like to be as honest as
any human can be because that's the
business model like if i lied to you it
doesn't really work
like there wouldn't be a purpose to it
because how do you make money on that
people would know it and then it would
just be nothing
so
as much as i like to tell the truth
when you talk about russia at the moment
you are actually influencing the events
and that's my problem
now you might say to yourself scott
you're not influencing any events
to which i say everybody everybody who
has a sizable audience is
because if the only people we're
influencing are other people within our
ecosystem
the other people who follow me etc well
they are also boosting messages being
influenced influencing other people so
you can't really look at the size of my
audience
to determine what impact
anything i say would say because i only
have to influence one person right
a different person
each time perhaps but let's say let's
say i influence one person who followed
me who happened to be influential
themselves
do you think anybody who follows me who
is also influential
yeah i mean
there's a number of members of congress
follow me on twitter
so so at least there are people who are
influential within america
who would uh
who would you know hear what i say
so here's the question
do i have an obligation to just tell you
the cleanest version of the truth
as i say it
or is my obligation to
persuade because remember this is life
and death
this is a war
this would be the biggest land war in
europe since world war ii
do i have
am i cleared
morally and ethically
can i avoid persuading in this case
let me put that into a direct question
let's say i imagined i could make some
difference i mean that that's a stretch
i guess we'd all agree on that
but it was suppose i imagined
i could have some influence
what would be more ethical
to try to persuade
against war
or to be as clear and clean and honest
as i possibly can and then let you make
your decisions
right not to lie
not to lie right
so i won't lie
so i'm not asking you whether i should
lie
that's important so i'm not saying lying
versus not lying i'm saying
honest in both cases
but if you use hyperbole that's not
really lying
especially if you're predicting the
future
it's more like
exaggerating and people will usually
know it
all right
here's
here's what my critics
didn't understand about my opinions
and i and this will come clear as i talk
about some of this russia stuff and i
guess i'm going to hold this opinion
until i give you a little more context
and then we'll we'll circle back to it
so if we're trying to figure out what
what is happening in ukraine here's some
background
um
you know that
ukraine gave up its nukes at one point
but apparently there were russia's nukes
and they just getting them back but you
hate the precedent
that a country gives up its nukes and
then it's vulnerable
right
so it kind of looks like that although
they were russian nukes so maybe it's a
different situation
but that's that's one factor
um zelensky says he wants to meet with
putin because he doesn't know what
russia wants
do you believe that
do you believe that zelinski literally
doesn't know what putin wants
well
remember i said
if i if i could meet with putin for an
hour i could clear this all up
i think zolensky thinks the same thing
if he could find out what is the number
one most important thing
then there would be something to
negotiate about
but if you think there are several
things which russia wants
and putin doesn't tell you which one is
the big one
you can't negotiate
right there's nothing to negotiate
because you'd just be throwing things at
the at the problem without any precision
whatsoever
but if you could get putin to say look
i like national defense i like selling
gas i want strategic
i don't know strategic advantage
whatever if you figure out what his top
thing was
then you might find out with some kind
of counteroffer for the most important
thing and then you'd have something to
work with but he's not giving us
anything to work with so i think
zielenski's instinct
to see if you could get him to give up
what his top priority is
i would do that i mean who knows if it's
productive but if you don't do it you
would feel like
you had missed a step
i think
so
i asked in a twitter poll
a bunch of mostly americans who follow
me
what did you think was putin's main
reason for wanting ukraine and i gave
three choices but maybe these are
incomplete i said national defense
russian glory
or economics now of course these are all
connected right you know defense and
economics are connected pretty closely
but still you could think of them
separately and your answers were roughly
even
roughly even so last i checked it was
like 28 for national defense
34 for russian glory 38 for economics
now
if the if the reason is economics
doesn't that mean that
capturing uh ukraine would be a positive
for the gdp of of russia right
so i asked ian bremmer who by the way
you should be following are you all
following ian bremmer
on the the russia stuff the china stuff
and any of these international relations
stuff
you want to you want to follow ian
bremmer now you don't have to agree with
him
but in terms of context and
being connected to stuff
i would say he's a must yeah on twitter
so ian bremmer make sure you follow him
so i asked him
in some twitter exchanges if he thought
that russia would come out come out
ahead or behind economically
what do you think
i'll ask you
do you think that russia would come out
ahead or behind economically
if they do a full invasion
i'm seeing mostly behind
fewer heads but mostly behind
all right so ian
ian's uh
prediction was also that they would come
out behind
and that they might even go into a
recession based on the um
well i suppose not only the cost of war
because it's pretty expensive but also
the sanctions
now do you believe that
prediction
do you believe that russia would suffer
a recession
which is not permanent and wouldn't
affect putin much himself
does that sound about right that the the
worst we could do
the worst thing we could do to him is a
recession and that wouldn't probably
last forever
everybody agree
so would that be enough to stop him
now ian bremmer
i guess would say no
that he would accept that i think he did
say that ian said that that that putin
would accept a recession
to to gain control of ukraine
now if that's true
is it because he thinks in the long run
it will be economically positive
what do you think
i would say short run a recession is
largely guaranteed
uh close to guaranteed nothing's
guaranteed
but in the long run do you think if
putin could
reduce his cost of holding ukraine so
the military cost goes down over time
finds a way around these sanctions or
maybe this actions drop off after
10 years or something
does he end up with a long-term gain
because ukraine
you know has resources
does he end up with a long-term gain
that just
demolishes his short-term cost
and would putin do that
at his current age
at putin's current age
would he make a 20-year bet
on russia
i don't know that he would
a 20-year bet
i know
maybe
maybe because you know he could be still
in charge when he's 85 or something
very possible
um
so i would say there's a little bit of a
mystery
about what's going on
um andre's back house
thought that uh if you look at russia's
history over the last 300 years
they like to conquer weaker neighbors
and so maybe it's nothing but an impulse
to conquer your weaker neighbor and
that's all it is and everything else is
just rationalizations and stuff like
that now i don't think it's that simple
but there might be some of that in there
there might be a little bit of we always
conquer our weaker neighbors because we
can
so you know creates a little buffer
buffer zone there
so i think that's in there too
but
here's where i get back to uh having
opinion versus persuading
if putin knows exactly the costs of
attacking
i think he's likely to do it
if he knew the costs in other words if
he knew
that the worst thing would happen is a
recession that lasted
five to ten years
i think he would go ahead and attack
what do you think
if he knew that was his only price
do you think he'd attack five to ten
years of recession
i think yes
more likely yes than no
now
how can somebody like me
who's just a person talking on a live
stream with a you know limited
limited audience
how could i change the economic equation
could i do it let me ask you could i
personally
personally just me
with whatever effect i could have could
i change the cost of invasion
the answer is yes
yes
here's how
in economic terms uncertainty is
expensive
uncertainty is expensive
so the higher the uncertainty
the more expensive
in terms of how you approach the
decision and we know that putin is a
rational player right
putin is super rational
and smart
so he is going to understand that the
higher the risk the higher the price
so
when i say things like i did on twitter
that putin might be a week away from
having north econom north korea's
economy
people criticized me and said scott
scott scott
uh you don't know much about
international relations
because not only does russia have you
know cash and gold reserves
but they have the most important thing
to sell
that somebody's definitely going to buy
which is energy gas and
if they were to cut off gas to europe
they would freeze europe in the winter
so that you know germany is half of its
i think half of its energy comes from
russia
so
russia
basically has a lock on stuff and they
can kind of do what they want because
they've got control
but
here's how i can raise the price
for putin
by increasing his uncertainty
now i can't do it directly because one
assumes that putin is not watching this
live stream
but i can put the idea into the public
that russia doesn't know what's coming
they don't know what's coming militarily
remember when i said do you remember
when i said
what kind of drone attacks what kind of
what kind of anti-tank weaponry does
ukraine have how hard will they fight
what kind of secret technology as nato
and the united states provided to
ukraine that nobody knows about
the reason that i talk about
how many
types of exotic weapons ukraine could
have
is not just because it's totally clear
and true
right it's not true that i know what
they have
it's true that we don't know what they
have that is clear and true we don't
know what they have
and therefore
russia doesn't know what they have and i
like to remind them
and if i can say that point enough maybe
other people will repeat it
and maybe it reaches the attention of
the russians that they haven't given
enough thought
to the uncertainty of this particular
war
because i think their i think their
frame of reference is fighting countries
that are i have a lower technical
capability
am i right
if you're if you've only fought
countries that have low technical
capability
and now you go up against ukraine which
individually doesn't have high technical
capability but they have friends
who have what i call the good stuff
in theory
every american weapons manufacturer
should have already stepped up
and said can you test our new thing on
the battlefield
can you test the new thing because we
need to test it in battle
nobody's seen it yet and we're certainly
not going to waste it in afghanistan
because if you it in afghanistan
people will see your weapon and you
might want to save that for a high-tech
fight
so
i would like russia to do a little more
thinking
about what they don't know
and what they don't know is what ukraine
has access to
or
could have access to within 24 hours of
an attack
so it might not be true that they have
access to anything good right now
but i'll bet it's nearby i'll bet it's
staged
i'll bet the best weapons that have ever
been invented and never tested in an
actual battle are somewhere near that
theater
somewhere in the area if you know what i
mean
you would just make sure you were you
were ready in case somebody said you
know
maybe we need that anti-tank drone after
all can you fire that up see what
happens
so
do you see the distinction
when i'm talking about the
the war
i want to add uncertainty to it for the
russian side
without lying
have i said anything that sounds like a
lie
i don't think so because i'm not lying
i'm just saying that they should spend
more time thinking about what's under
the bed
because they don't know
putin doesn't know what's under the bed
and let me tell you
i'm sure he didn't see it in syria
right
if we have some good stuff
good stuff
and we've made it available to ukraine
he hasn't seen it yet
so
one of the reasons that biden might be
calling his bluff so to speak as he
knows that
a major invasion would be a slaughter
possibly a slaughter of the invaders
it's possible
that the russian army would be wiped out
possible i don't know what the odds are
if you if you said what are the odds i'd
say low
10
would putin take a 10 chance of losing
this war
what do you think
maybe maybe a 10 chance would he take a
20 chance of losing
like actually just losing flat out
losing
20 chance
would he take it
that's about where that's about where
the risk taking breaks down isn't it
for uh for a
military battle you might take nine to
one
well you're not going to take four to
one
i don't think
you know i'm not a military guy and
every situation is different you know
you're going to take a different risk
for different opportunities
but um so i would like russia to know
through whoever wants to remind them
that they have no idea what kind of
weapons are going to be thrown at them
when they cross that border and they
have no way to know there is no way for
them to know
their their i don't think their intel
would be that good
here's another factor um as also ian
bremer points out and by the way his
twitter feed is just gold for this
for this topic
he points out that in 2008 russia moved
against georgia in 2013 russia you know
moved in syria
you know nobody nobody stopped them 2014
they moved again in ukraine nobody
stopped them then 2016 elections
according to ian
they they meddled with those and didn't
really pay a price for it
so his point is that what you're seeing
today is just an extension of that
which is russia has realized that they
can just take stuff
and keep it
and it works
so why not keep doing it
and the answer is that
the risk for each of these will be
different
but apparently this is the one we care
about
you know what i mean
this is the one we care about i'm not
sure we cared so much about the other
ones even the u.s elections the amount
of meddling they did was so trivial it
didn't make any difference
i mean
if you've looked into it at all you know
that statement is true it didn't make
any difference
it was beyond
less than a high school attempt it
didn't even look like professionals were
involved at all
like literally it didn't look like any
professionals were involved in meddling
in the election
now that the hacking is different
but i think that's also unproven
when i say unproven i mean that i as a
citizen of the united states don't
believe what my intelligence agencies
say about anything
and so in that sense it's unproven
um
i asked this question
how long do russia's pipelines to
anywhere doesn't matter which direction
how long do they last if war breaks down
if all out war breaks out in ukraine
how long will the russian pipelines last
and then people said scott scott scott
you are such an idiot and possibly a
boomer
that you don't understand
basic things about this situation the
basic thing is that if you bomb the
pipelines uh
europe would
freeze so basically you can't do it you
can't bomb the pipelines because russia
would freeze
what do you what do you say i'm sorry
that europe would freeze
what do you say to that do you say that
the pipelines are unassailable
because
the the cost is too high
are the pipelines unassailable
okay
point number one
it doesn't matter if they're
unassailable
let me put it this way
if you're in ukraine
and your country gets attacked by a
foreign invader
and you had the capability now this is a
big if you had the capability
to take out a pipeline in russia
but of course the impact would be a big
impact on european countries like big
impact people would die lots of them
if you were if you're a ukrainian and
europe had not protected you would you
take out the pipeline
i would
i would
yeah let me let me say that as clearly
as possible
if i were a ukrainian or any country
listen i'm american i'll just use
america
let's say there's a foreign invader pick
the country it doesn't matter what
country
and they actually put boots on the
ground in my country
boots on the ground in my country
you think i'm not going to take out
their pipeline
i'll take it out the first day
first day you think i wouldn't freeze
europe
if europe hadn't helped me
now if europe doesn't help me i'm
freezing their asses off tomorrow
i'm going to freeze germany's balls off
if they let my country be attacked and
they could have helped and they didn't
now that the big if is they could have
helped but they didn't right
could help but they didn't that's that's
essential
yeah now it doesn't matter
if you and i think it would be the worst
idea in the world to attack a pipeline
am i right it doesn't matter what we
think
i don't want them to attack a pipeline
because i don't want europe to freeze
europe doesn't want them attacked to
attack a pipeline
united states doesn't want him to attack
a pipeline i don't think
russia doesn't china doesn't there's
nobody who wants the ukrainians to
attack a pipeline
but i think the only thing that will
matter
is if they can
i think that's all that matters if they
can they will
i would
i mean i would in a heartbeat
so you just need at least one person
like me in ukraine
who has the capability you just need one
what would it take to take out a
pipeline well i think they're probably
underground for the most part so it's
not easy but there are pumping stations
if you take out the pumping station the
pipeline's useless
do you you don't think uh ukraine has
the ability to drop a drone on a on a
pumping station
now that presumably there's defenses
national defenses and stuff but you
don't think we could slip a drone into a
pumping station and take it out
now when i say we i mean american
technology but not operated by americans
in this case
if we've provided ukraine any kind of a
weapon
that can travel a distance and take out
a specific target
why wouldn't they use it now it could be
that we'll prevent them from using it if
we have control
but
i all right so backing up to my original
point
when i'm talking about what could happen
in russia
i'm not just trying to tell you what's
clear and true
i'm trying to influence
and i want
russia to know and this is very
important for negotiating
listen to this part clearly
if you're not willing just to uh
plunge europe into ice
you might as well just get out of the
way and let russia have ukraine
am i right
if you're not willing to plunge europe
into complete destruction
if you're not willing to do that don't
fight
you're not ready
if you're not ready to fight to the
death you're not ready to fight
you don't want to be in a fight if
you're not ready to fight there's only
one way to fight
to the death
that that's it
there's no second way to do this
there's no second way
um
so so think of my uh my comments on this
as persuasion to increase the price to
russia
i would i would take out all of europe's
gas
and
and trust me
i don't want europe to suffer at all
like i'm i'm pro-europe
i like europe i like europe to do great
pro-europe
but if you attack my country
and europe could have stopped it and
didn't well you can all freeze
that you know that's just the way it's
going to be war is war right war is war
you're going to do what you have to do
so
um will the sanctions deter russia
do they know how bad the sanctions could
be
now i've i've heard it said that you
know they're somewhat self-sufficient
and they could always sell more stuff to
china i don't think they want to do that
i don't think russia
wants to depend on one big customer
that's that's a bad deal
they want to sell to as many as they can
so they they can put their you know
their power spread it out and their
influence and and also not be
susceptible to one country wanting to
turn them off
so
i don't think russia knows how bad a
recession will be
now one apparently one of our weapons we
have is denying them chips
now i don't know if they can get them
from the black market but if if we turn
their economy into some equivalent of
iran and i guess the sanctions wouldn't
even be as bad as they are on iran
i feel like we can make this
economically unpalatable for putin
and i feel like you wouldn't attack if
it's on economical
now i know that people smarter than i am
would disagree because you know there's
russian glory and there's strategy and
there's
history and there's whatever hillary
clinton tried to do to depose
putin and there's you know there's
yeah there's just you know millions
psychological reasons
but here's my take on russia
russia is basically a business
with the military
it's a gas company with nuclear weapons
right
and i think that
i think that's exactly how they run it
i think they run it as a business with
the military
and so in my opinion putin won't do
something that's massively uneconomical
but he would do something that's
temporarily economical uneconomical
who would agree with me there
that he would do something temporarily
on economical but not in the long run
because it's a business
so the question is can the united states
uh and the allies
put up a credible argument that this
couldn't possibly work in the long run
economically
could we credibly make sure he knows
it's not going to pay off
now you might say to yourself by scott
it's not about economics it's about
national defense same thing
economics and national defense are just
the same thing
because you can't buy weapons without
money and you know et cetera et cetera
so
i don't think that biden has done as
good a job as he could have done
in scaring putin
now here's where we ask
wwtd
what would trump do
if you wanted somebody to scare a leader
of another country who do you hire
biden
or trump
it's trump
it's trump every time now you could
argue that he was too
you know too russia-friendly and maybe
he'd be the wrong leader in some other
way
but if you just narrow it to just this
one one narrow question
who could scare putin better
let me give you an example
if if biden says to putin
there will be
unspecified sanctions that will make you
sorry
how scared is putin
unspecified sanctions
that will make you sorry
and a military aggression would be a
great cost of lives
oh he's scared now
oh
putin's shaking in his boots unspecified
sanctions oh
now imagine trump now as we've said
earlier you can't write in trump's style
that's impossible
but
imagine imagine trump handling this
number one he would tell he would tell
russia
i'm sure of this
i'm sure of this
i'm sure that trump would have said if
you invade ukraine
you do not know what kind of hell
is going to be unleashed on your
soldiers
you are going to be carrying so many
body bags back to russia
because you don't know what's waiting
for you
and we're going to make sure that this
never happens again
we're you're going to be burying people
three deep
so you see what i'm doing i'm taking the
general threat
and i'm turning into bodies i'm turning
it visual
and i'm making it personal
you putin are gonna have to explain why
you sent
50 000 dead soldiers back to your
country back to every every part of the
country and they saw that you wasted
your money and you buried their children
if biden had ever said
you're going to have to bury your
children
then i would say he's doing a good job
trump would say that
i mean something like it not that
exactly but you don't think trump could
say
you can be burying your children for a
decade
and we we will burn them as they cross
the line or something you know i'm
making it up but the point is that when
when trump threatened north korea
with fire and fury
he made a visual the fire and fury was
that
was it fire and fury is that the quote
but the point is biden's not doing that
biden's treating it like it's a business
meeting
trump wouldn't treat it like a business
meeting he would treat it like a threat
he would threaten him
wouldn't he am i wrong
i think he would directly threaten him
and say you know this is going to be
arms and limbs and blood and guts and
dead children and
and just you know and just make sure
that putin knew what he was getting into
or or worse
didn't know what he was getting into
yeah
so we'll always have to wonder what
trump would have done
and i would say this if you are going to
negotiate with somebody you have to be
willing to be irrational
this is really important
probably one of the best negotiating
tricks you'll ever hear
you have to be willing to be irrational
that's what putin's doing
right now
when you look at putin don't you say to
yourself my god
this seems so irrational
because couldn't you get the same
benefits with negotiating
right
putin has convinced you that he's
irrational
in the sense that he's he wants
something so badly he's not going to
listen to economics or threats
that is called
excellent
excellent negotiating technique
excellent
he's literally convinced us
that reason won't work
but of course he's a reasonable guy so
that's just an illusion
what have we done in return because
we're a democratic system
well in return
we've said that we we should be very
rational so tucker carlson
is telling his people quite reasonably
that we should not want to get involved
and certainly not militarily
quite reasonable
do you win negotiations by being the
most reasonable one in the room
never
never
so basically that's surrender
so the people who are tweeting at me and
saying you know scott you're overblowing
how much we should care
okay
uh you know scott putin's not afraid of
anything
he's just going to do this because he
can
he doesn't care about a little recession
and the sanctions he's just going to do
it
when you talk like that
you're talking completely reasonably
very reasonable
but you've also
signaled to the other side they can have
whatever they want
they just have to act irrational and
you'll back down
the only way you can deal with an
irrational player is with an irrational
response
do you know what would be irrational
we're gonna bomb your pipelines
we're gonna we're gonna freeze our
allies in europe and maybe next time
they'll see the wisdom of being on our
side
crazy right that's the point
totally irrational
but if you can't convince
if you can't convince putin that you
would bomb germany
you know you'd bomb germany's end of the
pipeline to stop it
if you're not willing to go that far
you're not negotiating
you're surrendering
as as long as you're willing to be the
only one who acts rational
surrender is the only rational thing to
do
so let's get to it
let's get to it we should either act
rationally and surrender
so there are no deaths you know just let
russia have ukraine
or
we should finally act irrationally which
is the only rational thing to do
if you want to win
if you want to win
you have to put it all on the line and
that means sacrificing europe
now
how many of you are going to hear this
and say the cartoonist said we should
sacrifice europe no
no
i'm not saying we should sacrifice
europe
no
i'm saying we have to convince putin we
would sacrifice europe
it's not up to me
it's not up to you
so we don't get a vote right so it
doesn't matter if i wanted to or not
it's irrelevant
i'm saying that it's not negotiating if
you convince the other side you're going
to be rational
and i think that's what biden did
he just convinced them we're going to be
really rational here which is basically
giving them ukraine
all right
so if we don't uh crank up the fear i
did see was it uh
david petraeus i think ian bremmer was
interviewing him if i'm recalling the
two that were talking
and i think petraeus was saying that the
uh the amount of casualties that russia
would uh
would have to accept to get this done in
ukraine
may be surprisingly high
those are my words but petraeus did
think that the ukraine
ukrainian military would put up a
serious fight
so
we'll see
um
let's see what else is going on
uh
israel and its uh allies in the region
we don't know which allies but some of
the arab countries i guess
um
are developing a joint defense against
uh suicide drones
so if a country sees a suicide drone
take off and they spot it before israel
does they would alert israel and vice
versa
so they would have a mutual uh mutual
alerting system
which does tell me
that the military believes that suicide
drones are basically going to be the
weapon of the future why wouldn't they
be really
i assume they will be
and then i asked
does ukraine have access to the type of
drones that could take on a pipeline
what do you think
do you think that ukraine currently has
or could rapidly get
the type of drones that could take out a
pumping station and a pipeline
and would the russians have capability
of shooting them down
and what percentage could they shoot
down versus what percentage could get
through any defense system
don't i have a water leak to take care
of
don't jinx me they're all fixed at the
moment
uh 70 shot down
so you so you send three or four and you
get a good chance
all right
um
here's an article by jack kelly
writing for forbes
and this is just more of a trend that's
good which is uh
we're finally seeing a renaissance this
is what jack says renaissance is
creating psychedelic drugs to help treat
depression ptsd ocd anxiety and other
mental issues
i'm telling you this is big
if only two things happened in the
future
we got fusion energy and or
generation four you know takes off as
more economical if we get
nuclear going
and we get psychedelic treatments
or you know some version of the
psychedelics for all of these mental
anxieties
the earth is in good shape
because
because if you can get enough clean
energy
the earth is going to have a much better
time with everything from climate change
to economies to feeding people
everything
and if you can get rid of people's inner
problems you know the
the nuclear power takes care of a lot of
the external problems but the
the internal problems of our brain
maybe we can solve those two
what about fentanyl well i wouldn't
um well it treats addiction so
one of the things that
could do is stop addiction maybe
well the uh omicron olympics have ended
and reportedly they were a huge success
within china
so the olympics were huge domestically
and they it looks like they even had the
higher viewership than before
because the chinese viewership was so
high it compensated for much lower
international viewership so from the
chinese perspective of
can they put on a major event they
managed to squash the omicron
which i was totally wrong about
for those of you who like me to admit
when i'm wrong
i predicted that there was no way they
could stop the omicron from laying waste
inside their perimeter
and they did
they did there's something
there's something i don't understand in
the story
because there's nothing i know about
omicron
that tells me they could have or anybody
could have
squashed it within a perimeter no matter
what you do
like i feel like there's part of the
story missing
like how they did that now i get i get
that they were extreme
but all the extreme stuff they did are
things we know how to do right
quarantine and test and all that i
wonder if it was the testing
it might have been the testing
because
this gets back to why the united states
didn't have rapid testing in the
beginning
one of the biggest reasons that china
did better is immediate rapid testing
they can test the whole city in five
hours
did you know that
they could rapid test an entire city in
five hours
that's how many tests they have and how
quickly they can implement
so we didn't do the extreme lockdowns of
this country so you know we would have
gotten a different result
but wow if we could have tested
everybody anytime we wanted from the
beginning like china did
we probably would have saved
a few hundred thousand lives
and
whoever left the fda was the corrupt one
i'm just guessing there was somebody
corrupt allegedly
probably killed a few hundred thousand
people i think that really happened
tragically
um
so canada has made protesting illegal
and so is the united states
uh so that's not good and what i mean is
that the january six protests
were basically criminalized and people
are being hunted down to pay for their
crimes of protesting
uh and other things as well of course
and now the ottawa police chief says
that even if protesters are retreated
and go home they'll be hunted and
punished basically
so they're going to look for you even if
you go home
so protesting
even peacefully
you're still going to be hunted down
now would you do a protest in canada or
the united states
um like one you really cared about like
that really was going to get
rambunctious you knew it was going to be
a
you know a dicey protest you knew the
trouble would happen would you get
involved
knowing what happened to the january 6
people and now the trucker convoy
honestly i wouldn't
well maybe i'm a special case because
you know i've got fu money so i could
survive pretty much anything
but if i were a normal citizen
i don't think i would
participate in another protest
how many of you think the same
for normal citizens does it make sense
to
participate in a protest in canada or
the united states in the future
i guess it depends where you're
protesting if you're protesting racism
still good
if you're protesting the government
apparently not
apparently you can't protest the
government
well i think this is a huge blow to
freedom of speech
obviously
remember i told you that the least at
least i tweeted it anyway the least
secure way to communicate
the least secure way is with a secure
app
have i ever told you that
here's another story to prove it oath
keeper leader this guy's stuart rhodes
he's being held in jail for his january
6 stuff and i guess he was calling for
something
uh
something violent
allegedly allegedly he was calling for
something violent
um or in let's say he suggested
something violent
but the way they caught him and the way
they're prosecuting him is because they
have access to his messages on the
encrypted app called signal
the signal app is the one that people
use
if they're really trying to hide their
stuff
but the government has it
how hard was it the gov for the
government to get his encrypted messages
from an encrypted app
i don't know
but they have them now they may have
gotten them from the recipient of the
messages maybe somebody screen printed
them or something and maybe they
threatened the recipient enough that the
recipient gave them up but that's always
the risk right
even if the encrypted app did its job
and encrypted it
it's still the message still starts
somewhere and then somewhere and you
could pick it up at the start or you
could pick it up at the end
so as soon as you use an encrypted app
you're yourself
hard
let me say it again
don't say anything
in an encrypted app
that you wouldn't say
in a regular app
and don't say anything in a regular app
that's going to get you in trouble
because it's all discoverable always all
the time
right
do not use
you know silk road
technology
don't think that crypto is going to hide
you
and don't believe that there's any app
that can keep your messages private now
as you know one of my private messages
from the signal app made it into the
press
i don't know exactly how that happened
but
yeah just so just
i i can't say this strongly enough
don't put anything in an encrypted app
anything nothing at all
that you can't survive it being brought
to light
now that doesn't mean that we don't
write private things in you know email
and everything else because we do but
make sure it's not something that'll
just end you
you know nothing that's going to put you
in jail don't put that anywhere
all right
be careful who you name your school
after i forget who said this yesterday
but somebody was saying it would be
smart to just not name any schools or
buildings after humans
because the humans turned bad after time
you know what whatever those humans were
doing 200 years ago doesn't look so good
today
here is the chief case of that
uh a tweet by a tweet thread by j perk
and he he knows something about history
jay does and he tells us that thomas
thomas jefferson was 44 years old when
he began
what many today refer to as a romance or
affair with sally hemings
a romance or an affair
he was 44 years old and sally hemmings
was a slave
here's the part i didn't know about
it started when she was 14.
and she had lots of his babies
so
um
i have to admit i didn't see this coming
i didn't see it coming i knew about the
sally hemmings thing
but for some reason i didn't know about
the 14 thing
did you
now
or his brother i guess yeah that's part
of the rumor
and
now of course things were different back
then people were getting married at 14.
so
you know you can't use today's filter to
look at any of this stuff
but
uh if you had known that someday you'd
be talking about 44 year old jefferson
having sex with his 14 year old slave
who obviously consent was not
even an issue
in that context
you probably would not have named your
building after him
and and i'm a giant
fan of
jefferson for his political stuff
but honestly you probably would not
name your school after somebody who
essentially raped a 14 year old slave
repeatedly
so
uh
yeah i well historically i guess the
historians think that's true
and that ladies and gentlemen
is the conclusion of
the best live stream
that has ever existed in the history
of live streams
i did look at the project veritas i
didn't listen to the video but i saw a
write-up of it
and i didn't see anything
in it
nothing to talk about really
so it looked like it looked like an fda
a insider
believed that the administration was
making money somehow but didn't have any
evidence so
you know allegations without evidence
don't mean much if there's more to it
let me know
um
have i ever been invited to an eyes wide
shut style party
have i
no i don't think i have
your overlords told you what to say
about project veritas
is looking backwards and judging worth
it well
the reason you put a real person's name
on your building
is that you think the qualities of that
real person
are
admirable
that's why you do it right and if you
later find out that the qualities of
that person were not admirable then the
reason for using that name disappears
i'm not sure that i would change them at
this point
you know at this point maybe it's just
you know just better to keep it for
historical reasons but
you know i can imagine if i were a
member of the
black american community
i would say you know let's maybe not
keep this
maybe not have this uh insulting
you know stain on our republic
maybe not i could see that view
completely
how are the drum lessons going i'm asked
i'll tell you um
is that a coincidence that somebody
asked me on locals about my drum lessons
and then immediately i looked over at
youtube and there was a comment about
dave grohl
one of the most famous drummers in the
world that was a coincidence right that
was weird
or is the same dude
i don't know anyway look like a
coincidence
so um
the drumming is fascinating because one
of the reasons i did it is to
keep my brain active you know you reach
a certain age and you want to keep
challenging yourself
so that's a big part of it um
but wow i'm learning a lot about related
things you know i always talk to you
about the building a talent stack
if you combine talents that work well
with the other talents you you come out
with more than just
a group of talents
they they magnify each other
and i was looking for whatever
like side benefit or
talent you know um symbiosis i could get
and i wasn't sure what well
what i would find
but i'll tell you drumming and
persuasion are really closely linked
because it's the drum beat that gets you
dancing right
so literally it makes you move that's
persuasion but also why it persuades is
fascinating the hell enemy
you know there's some thought that a the
drum beat matches your heartbeat
and so it naturally just you know you
you just tuned to it easily i don't know
that that's the reason it might be that
might be part of it
um
you know what was really weird as i was
just thinking yesterday
that a an interesting way to take this
podcast because i was thinking about
building a professional studio
you know when i when i visited uh
and was on joe rogan's show before he
moved to austin
i was in a professional studio that he
had built and it did make me want one i
have to say you know i sat there and
thought you know
i wouldn't mind having a professional
studio and i thought one of the things
to do would be
to have a surprise guest
right so i might
i was i was thinking of this yesterday
which is weird that you mentioned dave
grohl because i thought to myself you
know i could do a do a live stream about
drumming about learning to drum and then
i say i got a new drumming teacher
and then i just introduce him as you
know
my friend dave
and then you just have to know it's dave
grohl but i would just play it off like
he's just my drum instructor that is
completely normal
and then when he started
giving me lessons i'd be like fighting
back and telling him he doesn't know
what he's doing you know so you just
play like play like he's just an
instructor but you don't have that much
respect for him
i think it would be funny
now you would have to know who he is and
now he's you know america's maybe top
drummer at the moment
even though he doesn't drop which is the
funny thing
he considered one of the great drummers
in america so he plays the guitar
[Laughter]
which is baller and it's just by itself
the fact that you could be one of the
the best drummers of all time and then
just say you know i think i'm a guitar
player now okay
all right so um i'll tell you more about
drummer drumming in some late night
live streams that i do for locals only
if you would like to see my occasional
late night live streams from the man
cave that's what the local subscribers
only see
yes i said baller
you don't think he's a top drummer well
everybody else does
you know the the other thing that just
happened
with
that one of the things that fascinates
me about drumming is how to learn
so whenever i'm learning something i'm
always very conscious about how how one
learns
and the thing that i didn't i couldn't
figure out is how to get
like four beats in a row
versus six versus eight versus three
and to do it without counting
so to to hit a drum four times quickly
without counting the beats
but also to be able to do six without
counting
is like a skill that you just have to
hear it so many times
that you know it's for without counting
and i only just this week reached that
point
just this week for the first time
i can say to myself i want it to be four
and then my hands go
and it was four
and there's not a conscious counting
and then i can play it back and sure
enough it was four
so until you get to that where your
brain is counting automatically
you can't do a lot of stuff and i didn't
know
i didn't know should i be doing a one e
and a two e ender which is the way you
count when you're learning music
or should you just sort of remember the
song and do it from memory
or is there some other trick or is it
the way you're
you're beating your
your foot
or what is it
okay
and we're good
and that is all i have for today
i think you'd agree
this is probably the best live stream
you've ever had
and
you know what's amazing
tomorrow
it's gonna be better i know i know it's
hard to believe but true
and we'll see you youtube tomorrow
