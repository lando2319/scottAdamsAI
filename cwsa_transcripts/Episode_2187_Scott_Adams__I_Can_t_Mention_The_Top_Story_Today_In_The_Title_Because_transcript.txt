do do
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
boy we got a show today look at these
patients look at that look at that
secret documents on attacking Iran right
there
or maybe not possibly newspaper
clippings you never know but if you'd
like to take this experience up to a
level that's impossible to even imagine
all you need is a cup of mug or a glass
of tank or Chelsea style the canteen jug
of flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day thing to make sure
everything better it's cold the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
that's good stuff
well I'm watching my uh traffic numbers
for today I'm almost positive I'm going
to get suppressed today on YouTube what
do you think
what do you think will happen
to the people who let's say are
identified
as maybe having a particular point of
view
do you think everybody's going to have
just the same amount of exposure today
because the algorithm will just say well
whatever you want to talk about is fine
I don't think so
I think it's going to be the lowest
traffic I've ever had on YouTube you
want to make a bet
now today is Tuesday which would
normally be the first or second highest
numbers I would get in traffic
do you want about those smaller than
normal
yeah everything you suspect is true
just
just say everything you thought was true
it's probably true we'll find out
all right well there's a coup in Niger
country in Africa and Niger
and the big question we all have about
that is how can my tax dollars make that
worse
there's a coup in a country that I never
think about
but but really how can I send them money
to make it much much worse
that's what I want to know
well my favorite story of the day is not
that it's uh there's a zoo in China
and there's some allegations that their
star attraction is really a man in a sun
bear costume
now I saw the photos
and that's either a bear with some
wrinkly ass
he's kind of wrinkly ass or it's a man
in a bear suit
it's definitely one of those it's either
the wrinkliest bear
or a man in a bear suit
and let me tell you
if you said to me Scott I'd like to go
to the zoo and I'd say why would you
like to go and they'd say there's a bear
there and I would say
um
I've seen Bears on social media in video
clips don't really need to see another
bear
but if you told me that there was a man
in a bear costume pretending to be a
bear
I would be all over that Zoo
I would be Can we cancel our plans today
I would like to go to the zoo to see the
man who's pretending to be a bear yeah
that would get me there
all right well Twitter has removed the
gigantic glowing X from its roof
because well I guess the official story
is probably the San Francisco said it
was a zoning violation
that's probably true
but you know what the real story is
it had done his job it was the best
branding campaign of all time
that's right
they didn't need to advertise they
didn't need to tell everybody they
didn't need to send out press releases
they just need to put a gigantic illegal
X on the roof
and everything else would happen on its
own
is there anybody who hasn't heard of the
rebranding of Twitter
no 100 of the world knows about at least
you're following the news you know about
Twitter rebranded is X so another
brilliant marketing
PR move by musk and there's no way this
is an accident
if you tell me he didn't know this would
be a problem
I laugh at you of course you do it would
be a problem that was the feature it's
the problem that got him all the free
publicity so everybody wins San
Francisco gets to exert their
their power over him yeah we we got him
this time he thought he could put that
big X on his roof and make everybody
interested but no we're going to get rid
of that we got rid of his ex we win well
maybe everybody won this time
well there's a new capacitor technology
which could do the same things as
batteries in many cases a way to store
energy but it's made of cement and
something called carbon black which
apparently is common age-old material
it's a material that the black Scrolls
were written with it's very the Pearly
is common
but here's the thing this is from MIT
some work they did there
um David Chandler writes about it in MIT
news and turns out that
there's some possibility
that your the foundation of your house
could be a battery
Isn't that cool you can make your old
house a battery by using a concrete
that's got this carbon black mixed in
and hook it up to your electrical grid
and your
your your whole thing will uh store it
now that sounds nice until it rains
and then you're all electrocuted I
assume I assume you just get
electrocuted no that's not true you will
not get electric into different rings
but imagine if that worked imagine if
all of our roads and all of our concrete
buildings were just batteries
that would be amazing change everything
um well uh the residents of Oakland are
quite upset not only about the high
crime but all of the illegal immigrants
who are coming in
so did anybody see that happening
could anybody imagine
that when you got rid of good police
force work and you stopped locking up
the repeat offenders could anybody
imagine it would turn into a uh
a soul as hell hole
who saw that copy well nobody saw it
coming well my advice is you should just
drive around Oakland
um for the so I I live where Oakland's
between me and San Francisco
and by that I mean Oakland is blocking
me from reaching a place I would never
want to go in my life San Francisco
but now there's like another place I
would never go in my life well okay that
was sort of on the list for a while
Oakland wasn't really high on my list of
places to visit but now it's a total
drive around because if your car breaks
down in Oakland you're not getting out
it's a crime crime Mecca yeah we'll talk
about Hunter Biden I'm I'm working up to
it I'm working up to it
um I Heard a phrase today by uh Veritas
Lantern on Twitter that we're having a
pandemic of incompetence
does that feel right
we're having a pandemic of incompetence
doesn't that feel exactly like what's
happening
because all of the other pandemics
are as much about incompetence as they
are about any other thing
almost everything that's a problem is an
obvious problem of incompetence
and various
he he credits that incompetence to the
diversity equity and inclusivity as a
pandemic of incompetence now of course
if you're focusing on anything except
competence
you should expect to get what you focus
on am I right
if your focus is competence you might
get it
if your focus is something that competes
with competence
your competence will go down not much
doubt about that
so yeah it's a
pandemic of incompetence
um let's talk about climate change
remember how it was all warm and it was
because of climate change but uh turns
out somebody discovered there was an
enormous volcano under the ocean that
warmed up the ocean
or no I guess it it wasn't that it
warmed the ocean that much because
that's kind of hard to do it was more
that it released something in the
atmosphere more water or something and
that caused the heating
so everything you heard about this hot
year
might be entirely because of one volcano
I don't know that to be true I'm just
saying this some people think that's
what's happened
uh Bjorn Lombard
points out that our satellite imagery
shows the world is burning less than
ever
meaning that in the old days there were
forest fires burning out of control
pretty much all the time and now we're
at the lowest level of forest fires
we've ever been at
um
but yet the news is reporting that
climate change is causing more forest
fires
so at the same time
climate change is causing more forest
fires we have the least forest fires
we've ever had
does that track
maybe we would have Anonymous now for
all that climate change
uh I guess that would be the counter
argument
and then Steve Malloy of junk science is
reporting that the Antarctic sea ice is
the same volume as it was 40 years ago
the sea ice is the same volume as 40
years ago even though CO2 has gone wet
well what do you make of that I'm no
scientist but I'm gonna
I'm gonna put out my best interpretation
if it's true that the sea ice has not
decreased at the same time that climate
change has raged in terms of CO2 Begins
the atmosphere there's only one
explanation I can think for that
it's it was the masked mandates
am I wrong yeah it was the mask mandates
that temporarily protected the sea ice
but otherwise I'm sure I mean I'm no
scientist but I'm sure it was the
forcing us to wear masks
reduced our warm air exhaling
maybe had something to do with the
client I don't know I don't know how it
all fits together but the only thing I
can think of it has something to do with
masks pretty sure yeah the sea ice and
then the forest fires
probably because there were not enough
vaccinations
I think if you'd been more vaccinated
and got more boosters there wouldn't be
so many forest fires from climate change
would there
I call this science it's what it's
called
uh should we talk about the non-story
#the big ignore
literally the biggest political story
I've ever heard in my life by far bigger
than any political story ever
how do you think it's being covered by
the news
do you think it's the lead story on CNN
no no lead stories something about Trump
some Trump stuff
how about uh MSNBC nope nope about uh AP
about the others I think CBS is covering
it actually
uh Catherine Herridge
used to be at Fox News so CBS might
actually be covering this
I don't know what that's telling us but
it appears that the big cover-up is uh
in play and the look first of all you
all know the story right so
um Hunter Hunter Biden's longtime
business partner and best friend
testified that there had been at least
20 occasions in which
uh Hunter Biden called Joe Biden on the
phone while Hunter was with his business
associates the people on the right are
saying well that's a classic influence
buying model it doesn't matter what Joe
Biden said it doesn't matter if he
talked about the weather it was simply a
demonstration that Hunter Biden could
pick up the phone and ask the vice
president or ex vice president whatever
he was that uh you could get him on the
phone at any time
now that's what influenced by looks like
of course the Democrats are telling a
different story
but before I get to that were you aware
that Archer I saw one report give me a
fact check on this he was one of the
main fundraisers for
um Kerry's campaign
so there's some kind of John Kerry
connection to Archer and Ukraine
makes you wonder how many people have a
connection to Ukraine who are high level
high-level Democrats doesn't it isn't
there a Pelosi connection too
Pelosi's son or do I am I imagining that
get something to be a fact Checker I
have some vague memory of Pelosi son
being involved somewhere
oh it's uh Carey's stepson you're saying
all right so it seems to me that there
are a number of high-ranking Democrats
who have this weird connection with
Ukraine
a country that I cared less about than
any country in the world until there was
a war
and does that sound totally normal
and are you curious
why Kamala Harris is not in charge of
the Ukraine portfolio because that
sounds like a vice president job well
maybe because there's a war
do you think kamalu would have been in
charge
of Ukraine
I don't think so because I think the
only reason you put anybody in charge of
a country if they're vice president
is for extortion
can you think of any other reason
is it common to put somebody in charge
of like being the point person for a
country
and is it a coincidence that everywhere
Joe Biden is accused of benefiting
financially is a country that Obama put
him in charge of like China
every single part of the story just
screams corruption
but
what do the Democrats say well let me
tell you
let's read the
the headlines from CNN so CNN tells you
there are some stories that are really
important today things you need so this
is today they tweeted uh so we'll be
talking about Trump's polling numbers
U.S wildfires which will be fake news as
you already know uh Ford F-150 recall
truck recall space command headquarters
might move and then there's the U.S
troops maybe going to Niger
and then where's
where
is the biggest story in the world
it's almost like it's not there
it's almost like they're ignoring the
biggest story
in American history or at least
political story well it's not there huh
all right
in other news Trump will most likely be
indicted today some people say
well that's a interesting timing
how about that
what could get you more attention in the
news than Trump being indicted like UFOs
what a big old coincidence that that's
happening just at the same time wow
interesting
um
actually it was Steve Hilton's tweet
that I saw that uh Devin Archer was John
Kerry's top fundraiser and there was
some other collection Kerry's chief of
staff was David lighter barisma's
lobbyist
so Barista just keeps coming up
wow
all right so here's what I think I think
that uh
there's no chance that Biden will serve
a second term I think that's settled
and when I say it's settled I mean
there's no way that the Democrats want
to defend this story
for another year and a half
would you agree there's just no way they
want to talk about this for a year and a
half and if and and if it's Biden
against Trump
ask yourself this
what could Trump do with this story
I mean really
he would grind Biden into a fine powder
by the time he was done
there would be nothing left of the Biden
family
they they would go the way of the other
dynasties
and it would be maybe the third Dynasty
he would take out if you count bushes
and and clintons
so I does anybody agree with me
that there's zero chance now that the
Democrats want Biden in there and they
have the power to make sure he doesn't
and do you assume that it will be a a
health problem
are you guessing health problem in say
several months
sometime in the next six months maybe
big health problem because they want to
have time for the you know new
replacement to probably
you know probably Newsom they need a
little time for that
so I'm going to say within six months uh
fake health problem for Biden allow him
to move out
um
so I but in in any case there's no
chance really that
um Biden would be president again
does anybody disagree with that
he's he's effectively is done
there might be some people would
disagree with that all right
um here's a question for you how did Joe
Biden pay for his two multi-million
dollar homes
on the
on the income of the Biden family
why is nobody why is nobody asking you
that directly
isn't that like a really obvious
question you know we're trying to figure
out how you buy expensive things without
money
or any known source
yeah yeah he he wrote some books you
know books books are like the other
money laundering thing
so I have enough book experience to know
that the big books you know the Clinton
books Etc
no they're massive best sellers when you
look at the advance I don't think
they're money makers
I mean to me it looks like maybe it's
another Avenue for laundering money to a
politician sort of overpay them on the
advance and then say well we thought the
book would do better
we really thought the book would do
better I guess we were surprised so we
gave them a gigantic Advance it was a
best-selling book but we thought it
would do even better
yeah
so I wouldn't trust any book deals
that's for sure
so here are the uh few of the claims
that barisma hired Biden and then paid
him to get the prosecutor that was
looking into barisma stuff fired how
many of you think that is an accurate
statement
and it's based on the Devon or you know
the Devon Archer testimony but that
barisma paid Biden specifically to fire
that prosecutor now how do you square
that with the fact that
Biden has been saying and the
democrat-leaning Press has been saying
that a number of other countries also
wanted this prosecutor fired so Biden
was just doing what pretty much a lot of
the other countries wanted so there must
have been a good reason
therefore it was not
um not crooked
have you ever asked yourself who were
those other people who wanted that
prosecutor fired
yeah
this is this is going to bug you when I
say it
who are they
and at what level are they
are you telling me that the heads of
state of other countries wanted this
prosecutor fired
are we to believe that the let's say
Prime Ministers and presidents of other
countries
actually knew the name of the prosecutor
in Ukraine that was giving birth time
does that sound likely to you
that there was any leader of a country
that would even know that name or that
it's an issue or no no the guy needs to
go or even care about barisma in any way
all right so let's say that that's
hugely unlikely but we do have
consistent reporting that other
countries whatever that means
asked for him to go as well what would
be a scenario in which other countries
could ask for that but it's all fake
what would be a reasonable way that
could happen well let me explain it to
you
suppose all of your diplomats
were appointed by the president let's
say a President Biden and they were
appointed as diplomats and ambassadors
specifically because they would do
whatever abide wants because they're
just political appointees
now does that sound normal so far
that the embassies would be populated
with you know operatives of the
president
now suppose you went to your operators
and said you know we need some support
from other countries
for getting rid of this prosecutor and
then the people in the other Embassy say
who
that it's a barisma he's going after
Prisma his name is this and they say
barisma what's barisma well it's a big
oil company and and then this prosecutor
is going after him we'd like you to help
get the country that you're an embassy
of we'd like you to get their support
for this what's the guy's name again
okay and he's what
is a prosecutor in where you crave for
what barisma all right write that down
uh I'll go to my I'll go to my lower
level contact and I'll tell them the
whole story and I'll try to get their
support
so the the Ambassador or let's say the
Diplomat calls a meeting with maybe a
cabinet person or I don't know a vice
president
or maybe a member of Congress or you
know something like that and then says
all right I got this problem with this
prosecutor can I say we have your
support
and then the person in the other country
says well I don't know too much about
this but you know we like America we
like our diplomats if you're telling me
this is important sure tell you know go
ahead do it with my blessing so then the
Diplomat says yes I talked to Country X
and I talk to the right people not the
head of the state now it wasn't big
enough for that but I talked to some
important people and they agree with me
that this guy has to go
do you see how easily they could say
other countries agreed when all it was
was our ambassadors telling them to
agree with us
how ordinary would that be completely
ordinary
yeah you just tell the other people to
agree you tell them it's complicated you
tell them you have the evidence I won't
bother you with it it's not a big issue
for you you just need to write a memo
that says you're kind of on the same
page with this and we'll take care of it
and we'll do you a favor later I owe you
one
right
so when the Democrats say but no no
oh my God no he wasn't fired because
Biden wanted it because they were paid
to do it no no no no no and just because
Brisbane says that's exactly what
happened no no what really happened is
all the other countries wanted it
so produce one
give me one give me one person in
another country
who understood the topic
and did not get the information directly
from The Americans
and independently wanted this guy go on
before the Americans even talk to them
oh we didn't need to wait for the
Americans because we all know this
prosecutor is bad this Pro in fact we
can't stop talking about the barisma
prosecutor in Ukraine every time we get
together with a G20
it's like blah blah blah that prosecutor
for brisba we can't stop talking about
it
again
if you are a sophisticated viewer of the
news
your impression should be
that it didn't happen
if you can't give me any evidence of
even one person in another country who
understood the topic independently
before America you know badgered them
and said yeah we were on this page for a
long time
right where in the news is anybody even
looking for that person
have you ever heard it reported
which country specifically
what was the leader of the country did
they know
it's fake news
now I don't need to see the details
though
if if you can get other countries to say
they were in I it's clearly just
coercion
just obviously or they just didn't know
what they were agreeing to which you'd
be even more normal because they don't
care nobody cared about a barisma
prosecutor
all right um
let's see
so the Democrat spin is a hilarious and
I mean that it's actually funny and
here's one of the tips that I'd like to
give you when you can know for sure that
somebody in the public is lying before
they lie
you have to study their faces when they
do it
because well you're going to see one of
two things you're right you're either
going to see cognitive dissonance
which you might see from the
non-professionals who just don't want to
believe the news but the professionals I
think know they're lying for example the
high-level Democrats at this point they
know they're lying
so watch their faces while they talk
about it and look specifically for the
head shaking
the the head shakes know when they're
telling you something that they want you
to believe
when do you ever shake your head no when
you want somebody to believe in
affirmative statement
here here I go
boy it's sunny out today
it's a really nice day today is going to
be like I I think the weather report was
87 degrees today it's really good
morning warm outside according to the
weather
all right watch watch for just that
right watch for just the head shaking
when you see it it'll blow your mind I
saw three in a row yesterday
three in a row Democrats shaking their
heads vigorously now
while telling you something they wanted
you to believe in other words their own
bodies
weren't buying what their mouth was
saying
literally their bodies were rejecting
their own message and you see it clearly
it's really obvious once you're looking
for it
or here's another one watch for the
Leaning head you ready all right here's
my impression of somebody telling you
the truth sitting up straight doesn't
mean it's definitely the truth yeah but
more likely to sitting up straight
looking at the camera telling you what I
think is true
might be true at least the the body
language is consistent here's here's
what I saw yesterday and see if see if
you can find the person I'm talking
about right
third at 45 degrees while talking about
this topic yeah
um definitely there was nothing to see
here
um there was nothing to see
have you seen it
has anybody seen it
what watch the coverage just just look
at all the clips and look for the leader
do you do you think the leader always
does that when talking
no no when it's the truth it's probably
probably straightforward saying up but
when you're telling a lie that you know
everybody knows is a lie
your body starts to bend up and you know
mutate because you know everybody knows
it's a lie but you're selling it anyway
yeah
right
then also look at Dan Goldman uh with
his flop sweat
if you don't know what flop sweat is
it's just a real big nervous sweating
now I'm not saying he literally was
sweating he might have been but you know
I'm not it's not a literal thing it is
summer he was he was standing outside so
I'm not going to give him a hard time
for sweating in DC in the summer
but uh he did not look comfortable talk
about a guy who had to choose his words
carefully
yeah listen to him start his sentence
and you can tell he doesn't know how to
end it
because almost everywhere he could go in
the sentence doesn't help so he's just
trying to find some way he can say words
but the words won't
quite be lies in an obvious way and oh
man he was it looked like he was just
suffering
now he's the same guy who was took the
lead in impeaching Trump
for asking zelenski about
the Biden connection
and and see if he can look into it he
got impeached
for asking the right question impeached
how can he possibly lose
yeah they're going to have to put Trump
in jail there's a there's no way he can
lose at this point
I mean there's plenty of ways to get
loose if they put him in jail or you
know something unexpected happens but
but the
the straight line projection at this
point is Trump all the way
would you agree if nothing changed from
this day
to election day is is just wrong
and I don't see how the Democrats can
live with that because he's going to
take the lid off of everything if he
gets there
so what are they going to do
they're going to have to come up with
the mother of all
you know lies I mean there's going to be
a conspiracy theory about Trump that's
going to be so big
and it'll be one that's hard to
investigate until after the election
I guarantee you there's going to be
Trump took money from a foreign country
sold them some nuclear see there'll be
some complete like amazing
 because it's gonna be have to
be the biggest of all time
to overcome this this particular problem
all right so let's look more at the
Democrat spin which is hilarious
New York Times reports that Biden's poll
numbers got stronger that was their take
their take was a
Biden's poll numbers got stronger
now I assume the poll numbers were
before the Archer Devon testimonial
weren't they I who cares nobody cares
about that poll anyway
uh then the report is that the
conversations between Hunter and his
father well the business people were
sitting with Hunter was about things
like the weather
just nice of these like the weather
sure
totally totally believable now I do
believe that they did not make business
deals on those calls because you don't
do that by phone
nobody's going to make a business deal
by phone in that world right so
here's another one from the New York
Times it's long been known the Elder Mr
Biden at times interacted with Hunter's
business partners oh has it oh has that
long been known
what was it long known when Biden said
he totally didn't ever do that
and then they reported well that's not
exactly true it's well it's been well
known that they interact no they just
sort of tried to slip that in as if they
they'd always reported it nope
nope nice try New York Times I got
caught
and then then the left collectively is
trying to come up with a reason they can
explain away what we've seen and been
told and now they're saying that Biden
was only selling the illusion of access
in other words Hunter was a scammer
who absolutely was not selling real
access he was selling fake access the
illusion of access
and his father was not totally aware of
what was going on and the party the
father might not be aware because wait
for it
it was the year that Beau Biden died
so the loving father who cares about
mostly
his family
could have been distracted and not been
fully aware of what Hunter was doing
because of all the distractions
now do you believe that the media is
trying to sell you this story
this is if you're buying any of that
it's just hilarious
they should be mocked we should not take
any of this seriously we know exactly
what the story is there are no Mysteries
left in my opinion there's no mystery
left to this all Mysteries have been
removed
you should just mock them for being so
 stupid that they think that you
know you're going to believe any of this
um then they've also the left is also
spinning it and saying uh
let's see maybe maybe he's guilty of
turning a blind eye but
but it's because of all his problems
family problems uh they're saying
there's no evidence of her Prophet or a
crime
right there's no evidence of a prophet
so the fact that there are many
references to the big guy everybody
involved understands the big guy to be
Joe and there's plenty of documentation
that says money went to ju to Hunter and
there's plenty of documentation showing
that Hunter has been sharing his money
with his father and there's no
explanation for how Joe Biden could
afford the homes that he has
but there's no evidence that he's
benefiting from any of the money
no there might
they also say Joe Biden was not involved
in his son's business
do you know why they can say that even
though uh Hunter was selling the
illusion of excess and he was calling
his father during dinner with his
business partners and did it 20 times
and there's plenty of documentation
showing exactly what the scheme was for
all of it
um that's that turns into uh there's no
evidence of profit of crime it's wishful
thinking trying to create a scandalant
of nothing he wasn't involved in his
son's business and quote Republicans
have yet to produce a single shred of
evidence tying the president to Hunter's
corruption
now let me ask you this can the left get
away with hiding this story the biggest
story of all time in politics can they
get away with it
yep absolutely do you know why they can
get away with it
because they have trained half of the
country
to believe they're the news
half of the country believes that's
actually real news when when they're
reading these entities they actually
think that's real news now if they're
convinced There's real news the next
story they'll think is true too doesn't
matter what it is well this is the news
so did the Wall Street Journal so I
didn't see an end saw it on MSNBC that's
plenty of confirmation
that's called the news right
so yes and I believe that you know all
of the gaslighting that has led up to it
made it possible for them to sell half
the country literally anything
and I do think it's completely different
on the right
now the right you know there's the Q
Anon group that will believe anything
but
I feel like the right has a realistic
view of trump
am I wrong about that like if you if I
talk to anybody privately about Trump
you get a lot of the well he may have
done this or that or you know Trump
University is not his finest moment or
yeah he did he did those things with
women or yeah maybe there's some
technical violations yeah he probably
does have some documents he should have
given back yeah I feel like the the
right
sees all of Trump's
good and bad I think they see it all and
they even talk about it but they say
still a better deal than the alternative
in many cases but I feel like on the
left there's this like willful blindness
which is clearly just lying at this
point yeah at some point you could say
well you know maybe cognitive dissonance
they really believe what they're saying
they don't believe it now
you can be sure they don't believe it
now
if they've watched the news
so my hashtag the big ignore I don't
know if you've seen it yet hashtag the
big ignore because I'm trying to play
off the big lie you know the big lie is
how they tried to take uh Trump out the
big ignore is how they're trying to make
sure that Biden isn't taken out
so they matched their own big lie which
was that January 6 was an Insurrection
that was the big lie now they said it
was something else but the the real big
lie was January 6. and uh now they got
another one
the big ignore
all right
um
I would say that the future looks
incredibly clear at this point
so I'd say there's there's no chance of
Biden being in in the general election
it seems clear that the only person who
could step in would be Newsom
it does feel clear that the effort to
put Trump in jail
or at least take him out legally in some
way we'll we'll go to Defcon 25.
that however much effort they were
putting into you know crippling Trump
for the election now they have to apply
the kill shot
they have to take out the king so to
speak before the king gets in power
because if Trump gets in power in this
context
there's a lot of people are going to get
fired
a lot of people are going to get fired
right so I would think there's some
panic and Desperation happening in panic
and Desperation
given
um the context of all the the types of
plays they usually do on the left
doesn't it largely guarantee that
there's going to be a real big
fake story about Trump like a really big
one
because I don't think they have enough
to work with with the stuff they have
would you agree they've got weak sauce
mixed with weak sauce mixed with egg
sauce there's there's very few people
care about whistles in those boxes
now
I don't think Trump's done the best job
of defending himself about the boxes
you do you care about the boxes well I
care to find out if a republican can
look at them and tell us if we should be
concerned
where is the Republican who went into a
skiff looked at whatever's in the boxes
and came out and said you know it
doesn't look so bad or it is as bad as
they say Where's that how long does it
take to get at least one Republican with
you know as the highest level of
clearance to look at the boxes and just
tell us what's in there not not in
detail
just somebody we trust you know send
send in a uh you know Thomas Massey uh
Tom Cotton you know somebody that the
right would trust
and uh you know Rand Paul somebody that
they know is not gonna lie when they
walk out of the ship and isn't it great
I actually love this I I can think of
several Republicans
that I would trust absolutely to tell me
what was in the skiff not all of them
not even the majority of them
but I love the fact that there is a
small handful of Republicans that if
they tell you they saw it with their own
eyes or didn't see it with their own
eyes I would totally believe them
I don't know that there's any Democrat
that would fit in that category do you
name it name it Democrat
who you would know wouldn't lie even if
you totally disagree with them I can't
think of one
but you can think of quite a few
Republicans who you you're well okay RFK
Jr all right I'll give you that I'm
going to give you RFK Jr
so you win you got one
yeah there's no evidence that he lies
there is plenty of evidence that he's
not been completely accurate in his
suppositions about
scientific stuff
I think there's evidence of that I don't
know it's true
but there's at least evidence that he
may have gotten some wrong and some
right we don't know what the mix is
you know nobody could be right all the
time on on that domain
all right
do you understand now why Tick-Tock has
not been banned
doesn't everything make sense now
it all makes sense doesn't it
because Tick Tock is so obviously
dangerous to Americans it's so dangerous
that China doesn't allow their own
product in their own country I mean
that's all you need to know
but when the argument for Banning it is
so clear
and the ability to do it is so easy I
mean it's no big deal to ban it
there has to be bribery and Corruption
and now we know how it works we know
that the bribery and connection and
Corruption
is not in the form of I will give you
money if you do this because they don't
say that
it's more like so uh you've got a
brother-in-law he's got this startup I
see
yes he does
he's probably looking for money isn't he
yes he is
so let's now talk about tick tock
I think Tick Tock should not be banned
I'm China
and you know I and I hope your
brother-in-law does well with his new
business by the way I have a I have a
guy who funds new startups you should
have him talk
yeah once you have your brother-in-law
talk to my guy and maybe you'll get an
investment in startup but that's not why
I'm here today uh here today to talk
about tick tock
that's how it's done the the bribery
schemes are never direct because then it
would be a paper trail and it'd be too
obvious instead you have people who do
lots of kinds of business
you have them create a situation where
somebody's benefited but it looks like
it's normal business
that's how it's done that's the way I do
it I think it's the way it's always been
done
so you know the the model where somebody
just gives somebody a bag of cash
I'm sure it happens
but I don't think that's the main way
it's done
so yes Tick Tock I I think at this point
you could say that that's a corruption
story
at this point how many would go so far
as to say that the continued the
continued availability of tick tock in
America is a corruption story primarily
because there's nothing to understand
it's not scientific the the bad the bad
outcomes are not questioned by anybody
right the left agree is it's bad the
right agrees is bad for kids there's no
doubt
it has to be corruption
now you would see people arguing free
market and Free Speech right
not many and certainly not the
politicians nobody would believe them if
they said that anyway
so yeah Tick Tock is a corruption story
and
that's the whole story it's got to be
corruption
all right
the only remaining question on this
whole uh
Biden crime family situation and I think
you'd agree this is the only question
left
how many years in prison Will trump have
to serve for Joe Biden's crimes is this
like 10 years
I see like a 10-year sentence for Trump
uh for to pay for all the crimes that
the Biden crime family did
about 10 years does that sound right
I think so
um in other stories you know I told you
about that semiconductor
material that was supposed to work at
room temperature and if it does and
anybody can make it and it works at room
temperature and technology and
civilization will change fundamentally
in enormous ways like yeah we'll have
quantum computers and lossless you know
electricity transportation and
everything but the problem was
that as soon as other scientists looked
into it they said ah I'm not so sure
that's real
well today we have people trying to
reproduce it and claiming they have
so they're actually
claims that are no not credible yet
they're not credible
not credible but there are multiple
claims that people have reproduced it
one did it on video
there's a video somebody reproducing
now that doesn't mean the video is real
and it doesn't mean they really
reproduced it but the big question was
whether they were seeing a
superconductive effect or uh
diamagnetic effect
somebody somebody fact checked me on
that so there's some other effect that
could at least a little bit mimic
superconductivity
and the question was okay you definitely
did something so I think all the experts
were agreeing that something had
happened
because there were some floating metal
or something but it could have been a
magnetic effect as opposed to a
superconductivity effect and the latest
the latest reports and I I'm not putting
a lot of credibility into them but the
latest reports are that the new studies
were done in such a way
that you could see that it's not a
diamagnetic effect that it's real super
convictively do I believe this yet no
do I think there's a really good chance
it's true
yes
yes
less than 50 percent probably
I'm going to give it a less than a coin
flip odds of being true
but not zero
not zero
um
all right and uh
so uh Lauren Chen I saw her commenting
on the fact that South Africa
uh at least one political party of looks
like all black people in the party
were singing and dancing to kill the
white people the borers and Lauren Chen
tweeted
um
if you're white in South Africa get out
now just leave bring your family does
that sound like good advice
you just get out
yeah I mean it's not easy
you'd probably be leaving your family
fortune and other horrible you know
problems
but yeah I think you have to get out it
doesn't look fixable to me
but the question is do you think Lauren
will be canceled for saying that white
people should move away from South
Africa do you think she'll get canceled
with that
I doubt it
why do you think she would not get
canceled
did not get canceled for kind of a
similar thing
you know the American version
so here's the question
if you were in South Africa and a major
political party was holding rallies in
which they were chanting that they would
like to kill you and people who look
like you would that be a case where you
could discriminate
and say oh I don't think I want to be
around here
because that would be discrimination it
would be racist
yeah of course every single person in
the world goes oh yeah you're talking
life and death when it comes to life and
death you know all the all the wokeness
goes away you're just going to protect
yourself and your family
so let's take it down a level suppose
they're not chanting
kill the white people suppose what
they're doing instead is promoting CRT
and Dei and ESG which have the effect of
making the same group of people the
white people
um look like the
the problem
should you get away from that situation
if you could let's say go to I don't
know New Zealand and they don't have it
would it be good to get away from the
situation where you are defined as the
problem in your Society because of your
color
yeah I would say you should get as far
away from that situation as possible is
it racist
I don't care
do you care when it comes to life and
death you can be as racist as you want
I will defend that statement to the
death
when it comes to your own safety or your
family
you can be as racist as you are there's
no law against it and it would be common
sense
if that racism was based on some
statistical truth
or or even better if it's based on not
just statistics but there's an actual
program in place to demonize you
if you know there's a program in place
to demonize you
and people who look like you that's all
you need to know that's a dangerous
situation and you should get away from
anybody who buys into that scenario
would you say true or false
that my point of view is starting to
catch on
true or false
it's it's totally yeah no Society just
caught up to me I was just a few weeks
early
or a few months so I was February and
now it's the summer so I was six months
early
but Society caught up so you see Oakland
saying oh my God we can't even live in
our town
Oakland is saying that Oakland is saying
we can't even live in our own town and
and that and now South Africa
and you're seeing the cities completely
you know going to hell
and you see that there doesn't seem to
be anything that's going to change it
why
I don't know I mean you could talk all
day about why but I would say that
managing to the average of anything is
racist and stupid and you should avoid
it
so do you care if the average albonian
is not doing as well as the average
oh
French American
do you care you shouldn't
because because there's no such thing as
an average person
you should care about individuals
I I compare I completely care about
individuals if there's any individual
from any group that feels you know
discriminated against I'm very likely to
want to help on an individual basis but
don't tell me that the average of people
who look like you
is not doing well
I don't care
and let me say it directly the the
average of any group doing less than any
group I don't care
does it bother me that the average
um
Indian American is just killing people
who look like me in school
nope I don't care
because I don't know any average
um Indian Americans if you ever bought
one
have you ever met an average person
there's no such thing as an average
person
and why do we even use the average why
not why not the median
why why is it the average
is there is there a law that says the
median isn't a better measure I'm not
saying it is I'm saying that there's no
reason for average
there's also no reason for median
there's no reason to look at the
extremes
there's no no there's no reason to look
at the group at all
I think there used to be
historically if you have something like
you know let's say the Native Americans
you know losing their their land that's
a special case
if you have something like the end of
slavery definitely a special case and in
those cases you should treat the slaves
as a group at least until
things are a lot better A lot better
which is where we are now
things are a lot better
so the courts would not abide somebody
discriminating by race for you know most
businesses businessy things
and that's a pretty good place to be
but once you reach a point where people
are basically as as even as you can get
under the law in our imperfect system
once you reach that point it's worse
for the people you're trying to help
and uh was it I think Vivek used the
term
um
psychological slavery
psychological slavery there's plenty of
science
that says people perform to the level of
expectations would you agree that that's
a well-demonstrated effect
I believe it's I believe it's confirmed
in every way you can confirm anything
it's like most confirmed thing of all
time
yeah people rise to the level of
expectations so if you tell a bunch of
school kids you're the Smart Ones
the studies show they do better
right if you tell one group that a
systemic racism will hold them back
you should expect them to get lower
grades
all things being equal
I'm not I don't think all things are
equal
because it's the real world things are
never equal
it equals like irrational
so we should expect groups to do
different do to perform differently and
with some distance from things like you
know the Native American genocide and
and the horror of slavery when you get
enough years away from them and you've
done the best you can to reduce those
you know ongoing issues it doesn't say
there are no ongoing issues it just says
that treating one group like
second-class citizens will get you a
bunch of second-class citizens if you
treat them like they can do anything
maybe they can
now let me let me let me go even further
I've said this a number of times but I
want to see if
if you buy it yet
in every situation in every Market let's
say where black Americans have had full
and unfettered access or even before
they had full unfettered access they
don't just do well
they dominate
they dominate they they far exceed the
impact of their numbers in the
population look at music
right black Americans
full access to music right it took a
while not not in the beginning but
dominate
entertainment dominate fashion dominate
culture dominate
now what about
educational stuff don't dominate
but
in my lifetime black Americans have
never had equal access to education
they've always been treated as
second-class Citizens
so the the the lower the lower
performing people still get
opportunities but you know maybe they
fail because they shouldn't have been
there in the first place not because
they're black but because if anybody is
promoted to something that they're not
ready for that might not work out
um
so I would say that the end of
affirmative action
would be the first time that black
Americans have full access to the market
of education and and jobs
because as long as you're saying we have
a preference for this group you're kind
of saying there's something wrong with
them and they're going to hear it too
and if you just stop telling one group
there's something wrong with them that
they can't perform without help
maybe they would dominate too
right nobody tells black people that
they're not going to do well in sports
and then what happens Dominic nobody
tells black Americans they can't do well
in music
and they're great dominate right so why
why do we assume
that there's one group of people who
needs this Perpetual extra help
it's racist
is damaging to anybody who can perform
at you know a free market level
and it's not helping anybody
and it's also a ridiculous concept to
look at averages of groups because
there's no average person
it certainly makes sense to build a
system where every individual can
succeed regardless of their challenge
introduced today a very valuable tool I
don't know if you saw it it's my uh news
credibility
guide and I'll read it to you because
it's so damn good
so I thought it would um
I sure hope it pasted
yeah that's interesting here is all
right so here's a draft of my
it's just the first draft so we'll work
on this over time I call it the news
credibility
um
it's interesting
I pasted the wrong thing in there okay
well I pasted the wrong thing but if I
had pasted the right thing it would say
something different but I've got three
categories things that are probably true
things that are 50 50 coin flip and then
probably untrue and I'll just sort of
quickly whip through them these are
things that would be probably true all
right so these are indications of a news
story that's probably true not
guaranteed just probably one side is
hiding the story
it's probably true
if one side is disagreed about the story
well that might be a jump ball but if
one side is doing everything they can to
make sure you don't hear it it's
probably true
right
and don't you think that would be useful
for people who don't follow the news
just be aware of that wait a minute are
you saying that when one side just
ignores the story that that might mean
something yes yes that totally means
something it means it's probably not
true or it's probably true and they
don't want you to know it here's another
one if both sides the left and the right
report something is true
it's probably true
right if the left and the right gave the
same story about a political story no
difference
you'd probably think it's true and you'd
probably be right
all right doesn't guarantee it but
probably How about if all the studies
and it's been years since whatever the
question is has been studied but it's
been studied for years and all the
studies seem to be in the same direction
you know maybe a couple outliders but
basically it's all in the same direction
true or untrue
probably true
probably true now there are some
qualifiers here about who funds it et
cetera we'll talk about that but if
there were all kinds of different
studies and they've been doing it for
years and they all seem to agree and
there doesn't seem to be money that's
driving all the the same direction
probably true
can't guarantee it
all right how about uh when the studies
the scientific studies match your own
observations this is my favorite one
how do you know that smoking cigarettes
causes lung cancer well you got all the
science but even better
you know people who smoke cigarettes who
died of lung cancer
and you probably don't know nearly as
many who died of lung cancer and did not
smoke cigarettes
so that's where your observation very
clearly matches the science that's
probably true
all right how about we've got one one
narrative or one frame on things
predicts better than the other
that might mean something
sometimes the ability for something to
predict is an indicator that is true
all right so for example if I said
um
uh well you don't need an example if it
predicts it's probably true
let's say there's a large body of
evidence that something is true but the
evidence comes from lots of different
angles
so it might be one kind of science you
know direct witness report you know it's
coming there's a document
that helps that helps not guaranteed but
it helps if if you've got evidence from
lots of different angles
uh look at the hunter Biden crime family
story
the evidence is you know you got your
documents you got your multiple
whistleblower types they're saying the
same things it's coming from different
directions
basically the the completeness of the
the evidence is what sells it
how about a witness who's under oath
and has direct knowledge of the thing so
they're not talking about what they
heard from somebody they saw it and
they're under oath
probably true
but not guaranteed
more than 50 percent likely
but maybe not maybe not much more
How about if there's a witness and maybe
they're under oath but they're also
documents
independent of the witness there are
documents that say the same story
probably true
probably true if you've got a
whistleblower and documents
that's a pretty good case all right now
here's the coin flip ones these are news
stories that no better than 50 50 odds
there's one scientific paper that makes
a claim and is not peer-reviewed it's
not yet peer-reviewed doesn't mean it
can't be peer-reviewed it just hasn't
been yet
How likely is it to be true
no more than 50 percent
all right that's that's scientifically
or that's a historic Norm
a new paper
about half the time you can't reproduce
it
how about one scientific paper that has
been peer reviewed right the the
so-called pre-prints are the ones that
are not peer-reviewed but I suppose it
has been suppose has been peer-reviewed
what do you give of the odds then
about the same no difference peer review
doesn't actually have any value in
increasing credibility
if you can't get a peer review it's
probably garbage
right so if nobody will give you a
positive peer review nobody
well that's garbage right if you can't
even get a friend to peer review
that's not true but just getting
somebody to say okay it looks like you
did real science that person is not
looking at your data
they're not reproducing the experiment
they're just saying okay on paper it
looks like you know how to do this stuff
I don't see an obvious problem but it
doesn't really mean it's true
so that's a 50 50. how about a
meta-analysis somebody looked at a bunch
of studies which individually were not
conclusive and then they said all right
there might be flaws in all these
studies but we're going to lump them
together and see if they sort of lean in
One Direction or not
what are the odds that the meta analysis
is telling you something true
no more than a coin flip
and and you know what the odds were
before the meta-analysis
no more than a coin flip the
meta-analysis doesn't add any any
credibility
whenever you see a meta-analysis it
means that somebody doesn't know science
or they do know science and they hope
you don't
which is probably more of the case
is meta-analysis is politically
motivated more than anything else
all right so those are the ones that are
coin flip here are things that are
probably untrue
probably fake news so if you see any of
these things run in the other direction
this is probably not a real story number
one there's lots of money involved
that's it
Ukraine war lots of money involved
pandemic lots of money involved climate
change lots of money involved what can
you say for sure about those three
topics
that the news is almost certainly fake
not all of it every time
but those are domains in which you
should normally expect the lowest level
of believability
the higher the money the lower the
believability so these things you should
dismiss and a hand oh there's a new
study about climate change
dismiss oh but it was done by really
credible people dismiss
there's too much money involved for you
to believe science on those topics
doesn't mean the science was wrong
but if you believe it there's something
wrong with you
because that's not the right take the
right take is you're gonna have to wait
for a ton of science
when a lot of money is involved I mean
I'm not even sure you could ever
cross my bar of believability personally
all right how about uh if neither CNN
nor Fox News so that would sort of
represent the left and the right news if
neither of them say it's true
is it true
both Fox News says no that's not true
and CNN agrees that's not true it's
probably not true
probably not true if you can get both
the left and the right to say it's not
true probably not true not guaranteed
suppose you have one anonymous source
forget about it one anonymous source is
never true
I mean you could that's just
suppose you have two Anonymous sources
to say the same thing
complete two Anonymous sources have no
credibility whatsoever how about you
have um one witness under oath
but the only evidence the witness under
oath has is what Anonymous people told
them
no credibility that would be the UFO
situation the person talking was under
oath
but he couldn't get in trouble as long
as he said somebody else told me and
there was no way to check whether they
told him that or not
all right how about
um
uh the only evidence is for some reason
fuzzy photos and unclear videos
and for some reason you just can't get a
clear one that's
right if there was only one photo you
might say well bad luck you couldn't get
a clear photo if you have multiple
photos of a thing and they're all fuzzy
that's
how about uh
there was a randomized controlled trial
which is the the gold standard of good
science the randomized controlled trial
and it was funded by an interested party
let's say a manufacturer of some sort or
a or a partisan
uh you should give that even though it's
the highest level of science you should
give that no credibility
because although a randomized controlled
trial should be good
if it's funded by somebody who has a
point of view
zero credibility that would be the
correct take on that you should assume
bad behavior
um
how about it's a randomized control
trial but you don't know who funded it
you know you worry but you don't know
complete BS if you don't know who funded
it don't believe it
it's not good enough that you know the
bad people funded it if you don't know
who funded it that's the same thing
it's probably bad people
um How about if one side either the
political left or the right says
something is true but the other side
says it's untrue is it true
one side says it's true
and the other side says it's untrue now
here I'm not talking about a narrative
here I'm talking about a fact
only a fact not a whole story about how
the facts fit together but just one fact
I think if if one side says it didn't
happen and the other side says it did
it usually didn't happen
it doesn't matter which way you go
doesn't matter if fox says yes and sins
and says no or the reverse
if if one of them says it didn't happen
it probably didn't happen
so the the uh the examples of that are
there's a video in which somebody seemed
to have claimed something outrageous
CNN says yep
here's the video he's claiming something
outrageous and then you go to Fox News
and they say well here's a video in its
totality
and if you show the whole video it shows
that the the clip was misleading
it's the one who says it was misleading
was right and again you could reverse
those
but the one who debunks it is going to
be the right one
it's not the one who makes the claim and
they're done with it
so that's a red flag if they don't agree
now here here's where they you could
expect them to disagree about the hunter
Biden story
right because that's a narrative
but you don't see them disagreeing on
the facts
you know did Devin Archer say this
sentence they both report that he did
it's just that they they collectively
put it together and spin it a different
way that's different but the facts seem
to be the same on both sides
uh just some like to emphasize them all
right how about uh
the story is about a public figure and
there's video and audio to support the
story
so it's a public figure and you can see
for yourself it's right on the video
it's right on the audio what credibility
do you give that
it should be close to zero
even on video
because video is the biggest liar in the
world
do you think I'm on video saying
anything that's out of context of course
every every public figure will tell you
the same thing if they're the subject of
stories
the stories are fake now that doesn't
mean every fact in the story is wrong
I'm not saying that I'm saying that
there's always context about the story
that the story doesn't know and only the
public figure knows sometimes so yeah
all stories about public figures if they
make your hair catch on fire
that person said what
it's fake
now if somebody died it might be true
right but if somebody said something
that made somebody offended those are
never true somebody you know had
terrible Behavior allegedly according to
somebody you talked to somebody probably
not true probably not true
all right and then of course any new
news is likely to be fake because of the
Fargo War
so there's your list
um
let me get a little feedback so it's
just the first draft
is it useful
would would you be able to use it for
anything as in saying oh you know you're
making a claim that's you know at the
bottom of this list of credibility
okay so I'm going to clean it up a
little bit I saw that I accidentally
tweeted an older version there's a newer
version I meant to tweet
so um it's just slightly changed
you cannot trust audio Snippets
yeah and now in with AI you can't you
can't trust audio that's true
can't trust anything
yeah you need some white boards on this
but I think the uh
just putting on a document that you can
clip would be useful all right so I'm
going to go do that I'm gonna go fix
that and repost it and then
um
that was my contribution to Society for
today
diagram
yeah I mean I don't think it needs to be
a diagram it's just three categories
what how would you diagram it
defend diagram
uh
all right
Pee Wee Herman had a viewing
all right yeah Pee Wee Herman passed
away I had no idea it was 70.
all right then ladies and gentlemen and
thanks for joining over on YouTube
and
appreciate it and I'll see you
tomorrow
bye for now
