foreign
good morning everybody
and today is the first day of the rest
of your amazing life
until tomorrow and so far I think it's a
it's a real excellent day one of the
best possibly the highlight of human
civilization
and all you need to make it better is a
cup or a mug or a glass of tanker
jealous time they can't eat yoga flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing that makes everything better it's
cold this simultaneous now go
oh yeah
so good
well
um
should we start with the fake news or
the fake racism or the
fake War but it seems like nothing's
real anymore it just seems like
everything's completely unreal
well let's talk about hurricane
disinformation
so every time we get a hurricane
the the funny thing is that the climate
change side of the world the the ones
who want that to be the main narrative
they can't help themselves when there's
a hurricane can they
I feel on some level they know
the blaming climate change for a
specific hurricane has no scientific
basis whatsoever
but they can't help it
if you noticed that
I feel on some level they all know
that any one storm or one Heat Wave or
anything they all know it doesn't mean
anything by itself
but boy do they they insist
Alex says wrong Scott in all caps
yeah
so uh
as a Michael schellenberger points out
the mainstream news is once again
claiming that the latest hurricane Ian
is a sign of climate change when in fact
it is not
and I love this story about the one
community that have basically no serious
damage and they didn't lose their
electric because it was built to have
its own solar power and to have
drainage so it didn't even get flooded
and it worked
so I think the real the future is
building stuff that doesn't get
destroyed in natural disasters
that's what I think is the future it's a
it's a good future because that we can
build better homes that are more suited
to normal life
um you know the old saying
be careful what you wish for
or what would happen if the dog actually
caught the car
you know it chases the car but what if
it catches it what's it gonna do you
should be careful what you ask for
I think of this when I hear a Judd
Apatow
uh famous producer of very funny movies
who says he can't make a movie anymore
because
because humor doesn't work
now judge Judd apto is
notably you know very much on the left
so his team won
so congratulations Judd your team is
completely Victorious and now you can't
make movies
and I don't know if he's made the
connection
do you think he's made the connection
that it's because his team won that he
can't he can't do his job anymore
he can't make you laugh
because his team won
am I the first person to point that out
that when his side got everything they
wanted they didn't want it
yeah
well there you go
uh here's the other funny story so
Rasmussen is reporting and I'm not too
surprised at this 89 of likely U.S
voters think it's important that public
schools inform the parents
about what is being taught in the
classrooms it makes sense right
who are the parents who don't want to be
informed about what their children are
learning
so there were 11 of 11 of parents are
like I don't care
I didn't even know I had children you
could teach them anything you want I
have children
wow that's a surprise what are their
names
I mean seriously
what what parent adds answers that I
don't care
teach them whatever you want
you know you could get somebody to say
anything on any Pole
but here's the funny part you know
there's a conversation about what books
should be allowed in schools now you've
heard that many of the books that are in
the school libraries
and maybe even some cases assigned have
a somewhat explicit sexual
scenes in the books
and so there are a lot of parents who
say no we don't want our children to be
exposed
to any uh descriptions of sex in the
book
now is there anybody here who's actually
a parent
foreign
make me a list of all the things you're
worried about
start at the top
make them make a long list of everything
you're worried about but put the
important things at the top
where where on your list of things to
worry about would be
my child read a text description of
sexual practices
wait where would that be on your full
your full uh
criteria oh no
he read text some text of some sex
do uh do any of your children have one
of these
it's called a telephone
and you know it can do more than that it
can do more than make uh phone calls you
can get pictures on this with just about
anything you want
moving pictures too actual video this
thing will do a video if you want do you
know that children have access to this
right
they have access
to every sexual act
in video from every angle with every
kind of person
you want midgets and animals you got it
you got it horses and people no problem
we got it right here but you know what I
want to worry about
is having my children exposed
to text descriptions of sexual practices
and I hear somebody say no Scott
parental controls
how are your parental controls working
now is part of your parental controls
does that include
have you found a way that your children
can't get messages
did you block them from communicating
because you know other people send them
stuff right
it's not just them going to a website
their friends will send them anything
they want now does your parental control
include not letting your children have
any access to other children in person
or or digitally
because if your children have any access
to other children
they have access to everything
full video of every sexual practice
what do you think they're looking at on
sleepovers
do you think they do the sleepovers and
they're not sharing videos of gross
incredible things that they found on the
internet how would you not
remember yourself in seventh grade
remember yourself in seventh grade and
then somebody hands you a device
that can find every disgusting
horrible inappropriate picture in the
world
and you're in seventh grade and you're
with your friends and nobody's looking
now tell me where on the list is your
concern about the text descriptions in a
book
[Laughter]
it's funny that we even talk about that
give up
you know I can't give you good advice on
what to do if you have kids
because there isn't any way to stop any
of it none of it you just have to sort
of accept that your kids have full
access to everything
and they will look at it
now I don't know that that's hurting
anybody
I wouldn't choose it
right you know short of having any kind
of scientific information one way or the
other I would definitely not choose to
expose young people to all kinds of
you know let's say things above their
grade I wouldn't do it but there isn't
any way to stop it you know that right
there's literally no way to stop it
there's not even a little bit of a way
nothing you know you could try your
little parental controls but that's not
going to make any difference
so I don't know what to do I don't have
a good answer to that
amazingly something I don't have a good
answer for yeah
surprising
um
how many people laughed when I said that
the Russian military might be on the
brink of collapse
how many of you said God Scott's got
um oh
cartoonist uh maybe you should listen to
the military experts
and maybe not be spouting off about your
cartooning stupidity when you could be
listening to actual military experts
retired General H.R McMaster said
yesterday the Russian army is on the
verge of a moral collapse
um
well now it sounds a lot smarter
now that it came from H.R McMasters I
mean first of all
listen to his name
how could he be wrong with a name like
that H.R McMaster
will you get a name like that everything
you say is correct
you know who you shouldn't listen to
uh PL mcslave
don't listen to that guy I don't know
there's no guy named that but if
somebody was named P.L mcslave
nobody would pay attention
but when H.R McMaster talks to you
stop everything
H.R McMaster
says the Russian army might be on the
verge of a moral collapse if there's a
moral collapse
the Army collapses right I don't I don't
think the
uh oh oh yeah maybe you said Morel
collapse
yeah maybe morale
but I think it could be moral too
I think it could be both
I I feel like both of them work in this
context but he probably meant Morel I
did copy and paste it
so I so there was a typo and what I
copied and pasted
from the news
but anyway
what do you think
do you think the Russian army is on the
verge of a morale collapse
because that really means the whole Army
still some no's
well here's what we know
it's been a while since the Russians did
anything that looked like uh
a success
am I wrong
in the beginning there was like the
Russia's that Russia did this Ukraine
did this but there was plenty of stories
of both of them having alleged successes
now there are no stories
there are no stories of Russian success
not even from Russia
even Russia doesn't have a story to tell
except you know annexation which is just
 but on the ground they have
nothing
a hundred percent of the reporting is
pro-ukrainian now
now
I warn you all the time that everything
that comes out of that area
is sketchy and can't be relied on but I
think it does mean something 100 of the
news flips one way and one of the sides
that makes up fake news just gave up
making up fake news there wasn't even
anything they could fake anymore
I think Russia's done
I think the military is
um collapsing
I don't even think it's on the verge of
I think it's it's actively collapsing
right now
and it's because there's just no
positive anything anywhere
and and Putin's talking about Desperate
Measures you know do something political
threatened with the nukes and maybe get
some negotiating
do you know what we should not do we
meeting everybody but Russia I guess do
you know what Ukraine should not do
they should definitely not negotiate
you don't negotiate when you're winning
do you nobody negotiates what they're
winning
so
the the side that's asking for
negotiations is usually the one that's
not confident the side that says not yet
I I would say that this would not be a
good time to negotiate how about now
that's the site that's winning
so
we'll keep an eye on that but it looks
like it's just complete collapse at this
point
um
if you were to make a list of what
American policies China would like
America to have
for China's benefit
what would that list look like
you know if China could have its way and
and influence America what would they
influence them to do
and would that list that China wants to
look exactly like
what the Democrats want
well let's check
here are some things I would think that
China would want America to be
influenced to do to have a bad energy
policy
correct all right that Democrats would
like us to have a bad energy policy I'm
not even going to pretend
that it's just a different policy
in something you know I think you've
noticed that I try to be objective and
not call one policy bad and one policy
good just say you know some prefer this
one there's there's pluses and minuses
but as far as energy policy I think
we're Way Beyond there being a
difference of opinion
we have a bad energy policy that's
that's just a fact right I don't think
you can you can't really shade that in
any other way
uh so of course China would want us to
have a bad energy policy so we got that
soft on crime Democrats want that China
would want that for us
they'd want us to have uncompetitive
schools
the democrats favor the teachers unions
which is the cause of uncompetitive
schools
uh let's see what else would the Chinese
want that the Democrats would want
poorest borders they would want our
borders to not be secure China would
want that Democrats wanted to
uh China would want us to have
ineffective fentanyl policies
um we do now you could argue that the
Republicans haven't done better and I do
they're a little at least they talked
offer on it
um
China would want the us to have less
relatively less military spending that
sounds like a Democrat policy China
would want to stop Trump I think
don't you think I don't think China
wants Trump to be president
and Democrats agree
and of course China would like the US to
be super woke because that's the one
thing that could destroy uh the
diversity superpower
and I've said this before I think I'll
say it a lot of times because it's one
of those things that's worth saying a
lot of times
I never used to think that diversity was
an advantage
because it just gave you reasons to
fight with each other
but in the world scenario where people
can leave a country and go to another
country
I think it is an advantage because
basically we've created a brand in the
United States where everybody has a
reasonable shot
so if you're the best of the best in
some other country
where are you going to go
I mean there aren't that many places you
could go where you have a good you know
good civilization but also we're more
likely to welcome you no matter who you
are that's a real superpower and we
don't want to lose that the one way you
could lose that
is by increasing your wokeness to the
point where nobody can talk to each
other and then your diversity ends up
being a fight
so China would want more wokeness
because that's what gets us fighting
internally
um
am I right that there's a disturbing
correlation between the Democrat
preferences and China it's very similar
very similar do you think China wants us
to be uh super capitalist or more
socialist well China would want us to be
more socialist because that means our
money would be going internally to
things that don't bother them
and maybe less of it would be focused
internationally
so it's pretty startling when you look
at it that something like 80 percent of
the Democrat
um platform is the same thing that China
would want for us if they could design
our system
to make us less competitive
now it is true that people like Schumer
are saying directly we should decouple
from China militarily
right so you know everybody's on the
same page about that but yet the
Democrats are much closer to what China
would want for America hard to hard to
avoid seeing that so Biden says uh I'm
being you said the other yesterday I
guess I'm being banged up by the
Republicans but bring it on we can
afford to cancel 10 000 in student debts
and they went out to say that 70 of
black college students receive a Pell
Grant for many black students this loan
forgiveness will wipe out student debt
completely
can somebody answer this question
I thought a Pell Grant was a grant
is that a loan
it isn't a grant already
free
so is he actually does he actually not
know the difference between a grant
and
alone
I'm a little confused so if he really
doesn't know the difference between a
grant and a loan
we've got more problems than I thought
although I have to confess I didn't even
notice when I first read it somebody had
to point that out to me I actually read
that and it didn't even didn't even
register to me that he wants to pay off
a grant
that'd be funny to give them a grant and
give them some money to pay off the
grant
that would be the dumbest thing all
right
um
so I think we should at least think
about calling uh
you know any direct payments or grants
part of reparations
just because it causes a fight
all right there's a new study that says
uh I tweeted this today
uh that women are three to fifteen times
more likely to be selected as members of
the American Academy of Arts and Science
and National Academy of Science then men
with similar publication and citation
records
so did you know that
if you're a man uh you're much much less
likely to be selected for this must be a
prestigious scientific organization
what is left out is uh what are your
odds if you're a black man
because that would be interesting too
wouldn't it if you're a black man do you
think you have just as much trouble
being
accepted in this Academy
or would it be as easy as if you were a
woman
I feel like it would be this similar
so really this is not so much a story
about women having you know a current
temporary Advantage because again
historically obviously it was different
uh but I think they're leaving out
the fact that it's really white males
who are discriminated directly
I would assume right
um now when I said that did that sound
like I was saying that white men are
victims
because I'm having a number of uh black
racists are coming after me on Twitter
a whole bunch of black racists just
saying terrible anti-white male stuff
as usual but of course that's okay you
know you can do that on Twitter you can
be racist against white guys
totally permitted
totally permitted
um
yeah
anyway I think I had a point I was going
to make but never mind I'll get back to
that
um I would pay for this Twitter feature
and I mean this completely seriously
my entire Twitter experience
ninety percent of the negativity
comes from writers artists and editors
now I wonder if that's common to other
people
or is that just something about me I'm
going to start blocking all the people
making Shelley comments only because
it's the NPC thing to do
you know YouTube
is there any anybody there who's an NPC
what you want to do is no matter what
else I'm talking about yell something
about Shelley
right because it's the most common and
obvious thing to say has no use to the
world so it's like perfect NPC stuff and
it's annoying to everybody
so just keep saying that name over and
over again Shelley what about Shelly
because that's funny
it's so funny so thank you for doing
that
NPCs
so yeah if I could get if I could simply
not see
Nazi
if I could simply not space s e e
uh all tweets from writers artist
editors anybody who has anything
political in their profile I don't want
to say Ukraine flag or rainbow BLM
you know I don't want to see that little
Blue Wave thing and none of that stuff I
just don't want to see any of their
comments
now now
and and I'm not saying I have like
something against you know rainbow
people I love my rainbow people I just
don't want to see their comments on
Twitter
you put them anywhere else or you can
just get rid of that stuff in here
because these all of these things
signaled
um they signal a lack of seriousness
I guess that's what it is they signal
that I'm not here to find something that
works
I'm I'm here to cause trouble I feel
that's what the signal is
don't you yes I I support the current
thing
so there's really no point in even
having any kind of attempted
constructive dialogue with somebody
who's signaling to you that's not why
they're here yeah they're here for the
year from the play
all right
um
have you noticed that Democrats are
going to have a tough time selling their
accomplishments because there's
something about their account their
accomplishments that maybe you've
noticed there's a pattern
the things that Democrats have quote
accomplished
boy what is it that they there's a weird
thing that all has in common
it's all sort of conceptual and
invisible
for example Biden passed some
legislation for infrastructure
do you see Emmy
have you driven over any of his
infrastructure
it's invisible
either hasn't started yet or it's
happening somewhere where I don't live
or I wouldn't recognize it if I saw it
and I'm not saying it wasn't good to do
that's a separate argument I'm saying
that his accomplishment the thing he
would call his accomplishment you can't
see it now how about uh inflation
can you see it uh-huh it's like a number
right there on your guess your gas pump
what about uh
immigration and migration you can see it
there are pictures of people coming
across all the time
what about homeless homelessness you can
see it it's right there right what about
the war in Ukraine there it is you can
see it
I feel like everything that they're
doing wrong you can see and everything
that they would claim as a victory would
be something like
well we we talked about relieving
student debt
we talked about it I don't think it'll
get approved
we we released something from the uh the
reserves the oil Reserves
and and the number of the pump went down
for a while but then it went back up
it was like was that even real
I never even saw a picture of the
reserve
it was like a concept again I heard some
talk
and then something happened in the pump
but it didn't last
so
the Democrats I believe are going to go
full uh a negative in their campaigning
because it's all they have that you can
see
if they say we added some wokeness to
the system
can you see it
right we we improved the ratio of I
don't know diversity somewhere
did you notice
it's all invisible stuff
so the best argument that they have is
they're going to try to paint uh you
know a Trump World as a fascist dystopia
where everything's falling apart
it's actually all they have
is to lie about the other side
which is amazing if you think about it
now if I were the Republicans I would
make the list of what Chinese priorities
are and that I would match it up to the
priorities of the Democrats and I would
say well it's the same
is the same you could actually say that
you're running against China and the
Democrats
because you are
right the Democrats are so close to the
Chinese preferences that's like you're
running against China
makes you wonder how good China is at
influencing things over here
because it's sort of a big coincidence
isn't it
that
it's sort of a big coincidence that
things are going the way China would
want them to go
oh that feels like a coincidence
so here's the latest outrage so Kamala
Harris said that the hurricane relief in
Florida
should be uh based on considerations of
equity
what's that mean
so the the money
the recovery should be based on
considerations of equity
the only thing that means is less for
white men right
am I right
Equity only means less for a white man
why not just call it that
we're used to it
you don't you don't have to you don't
have to sugarcoat it call it what it is
you want white men to get less relative
to what other people would get now
she has an argument for it
just say it
white men have a lot
other people have less
she'd like to balance it out just say it
just say it right out loud white men
have a lot of stuff compared to other
people so we'd like to help the people
who are in a bigger hole
uh to me that doesn't even sound bad
not really
I I think I think it makes me mad that
when you try to take my money and lie to
me it's worse than if you just say look
I'd like to take your money
and we're going to help these other
people
because you're doing fine
but these other people are not doing so
well so we're going to take some of your
money and give it to these other people
well I wouldn't like it
but at least it would be honest at least
dishonest
I could deal with that I mean I could
have a conversation about that but if
you're trying to fool me into thinking
that you're using some other word equity
just say what it is less for white males
so that it would be more for other
people and you think that that's a
better world
Make Your Case
just make your case you don't have to
hide it
all right
um
yeah Equity means the actual outcome is
right
I don't think she's trying to make
everything the same outcome but moving
things in that direction you know and
again did it sound like I was being a
victim
say here's where your
um where you're coming from changes your
filter on everything when I talk about
this I don't feel like a victim do you
know why
why is it that I don't feel like a
victim when I say directly people want
to take things from people like me and
give it to people less like me
the reason I don't feel like a victim
well part of it is you know because I'm
rich okay so that's part of it but even
when I wasn't
I didn't feel so much like a victim do
you know why
because I had plenty of options
so I just go from if I'm somewhere where
there's a disadvantage
I just leave there and I go where I have
an advantage
I grew up in a small town in Upstate New
York
I didn't stay if I stayed I would have
no opportunity
so I left
when I worked at a company that said you
know for a while and we can't tell you
how long we're not going to promote
white people
or white men only white men really
so I so I left
and I went where I didn't have you know
that kind of pressure and then I
succeeded
we have we have a a weird
a weird situation in the economy right
now where anybody qualified can get a
job
anybody literally anybody qualified can
get a job it's a weird time in history
so if you can leave Where You Are
your cousin was in Nexium that's
interesting if you could leave where you
are and go to some place great it's not
the biggest problem in the world it
really is
so I don't feel like a victim because I
have Mobility
and I have an education
if I didn't have an education and I
didn't have Mobility I would feel like a
victim for sure
very much so
do you know what there's there's an
excellent uh
Instagram account
I wish I remembered his name as
something like American incomes
where there's a a young man who just
um
stops people on the street and asks them
what they do for a living and what their
income is
and how long they've done it and you
know what kind of job it's actually the
most fascinating thing first of all it's
fascinating that people would answer the
question but I actually learned quite a
bit
listening to people say what their
income was here's the big shocker
you know they they go to the uh the
software developer
they go what's your income he's like uh
125 000 a year some were like 200 000 a
year
and I'm thinking to myself pretty good
not bad software developers pretty good
job 125 to 190 200 not bad
and then they talked to a truck driver
three hundred thousand
truck driver
and I think it's because he owns his own
company
now I don't know what that means maybe
he has more than one truck or that
owning a truck is the company I'm not
sure
but uh and then then they talk to a
concrete guy
all right so the concrete guy comes out
they go what do you do he goes I'm in
concrete what'd you make last year uh
three or four hundred thousand
yeah then they talk to the real estate
guys
then the real estate guys are like I
made a million dollars
a million dollars
it's also interesting to see the
composition of the people
yeah you see the the bedraggled looking
people just killing it and some people
are really put together not not killing
it at all and it just is real eye-opener
about how many types of people there are
and how many opportunities there are and
if you chose a job that doesn't have
much of an upside
well
well there you go
all right
so we got science discriminated against
men
we got
everybody discriminated against
everybody
all right is there anything else going
on
um
talent and desire
this needs to be the next theme in
Dilbert what does
how much did they spend after taxes
that's a good question
well so I guess the Jeffrey Dahmer movie
was getting some criticism by the lgbtq
community
because he was a little too gay he's gay
and the cannibal we don't like that it's
bad for the brand
let's get rid of this troll
put the user in timeout
anybody else
um
is VP Harris protecting yourself by
trying to be the equities are now I
don't think that really protects her I
mean I see what you're saying but that's
not much protection I don't even think
the Democrats want her
do they
yeah I wasn't really interested in the
Dahmer movie
do you watch movies where just bad
things happen to people
you should really take my uh my rule
that if you watch a movie as soon as
somebody is tied to a chair
you should turn it off
is anybody on board if you see a movie
and anybody who's tied to a chair
as soon as you see it just turn it off
and never go back to it
because if that's the best you can do
is yet another thing about somebody tied
to a chair
you do not deserve to be making movies
if that's the best you can do
I also uh don't watch car chase scenes I
fast forward through them
because you know what a car chase scene
looks like
my face
my face
how many times do you want to go back
and forth between somebody's face and
something happening really quickly
that's hard to say
and then fight scenes
do you fast forward through the fight
scenes I started fast forwarding through
all group fight scenes if it's
one-on-one I might watch it because
there might be something interesting
dialogue but if it's the one hero
against the 25 people in the bar
fast forward yup yup yup yup he wins
again fast forward
how about how about uh the scenes where
they're establishing that the two people
are very much in love because they're
going to kill the woman pretty soon
how about that one because you know the
wife is going to be dead
because they're or kidnapped or
something right as soon as soon as the
movie people start acting uh fake sexy
I'm like oh
oh
is there some kind of acting school
where they teach you how not to be
attractive to another person
I am yeah I can't even do an impression
of how bad it is to watch movie people
pretend they're in love
oh my God it's so bad
fast forward so I won't watch any
romantic scene and if they try to put a
sex in it to try to turn me on I'll be
like um you're an R-rated movie Good
Luck boom fast forward
all right so I don't want to see any
chase scene I don't want to see any
fight scene
I don't want to see any torture scene I
don't want to see any romance scene
I still do kind of like the dialogue
scenes
among bad guys and good guys and good
guys who are Rogues and their bosses
like sometimes the dialogue is good and
everything else is just filler
when I watch a Marvel movie I fast
forward through the the action scenes
I mean think about that these are movies
that are made entirely for the action
scenes pretty much
I fast forwarded to that stuff there's
nothing interesting in those they all
look the same now
how many Spider-Man movies are there
it's just all the same movie isn't it
every sporty man is exactly the same as
the last Spider-Man
but the worst one of all is Doctor
Strange I do like Doctor Strange because
I like the actor and some of the
dialogue and stuff but you can't really
make a movie about magic
because the ending is always the same
well somebody used some magic
and then be in between there was like
some fight
but one of the things that all the
magicians have to do is not use their
good spells right away have you noticed
that
super super bad villain I'll use my
little spell where I'll send a little
bit of a fireball your way
and then the other wizard will be like
stop the fireball
shoot it back and I'm thinking to myself
oh was that like your best magic there
and then later they'll be like ah
bringing down skyscrapers on the other
one and I'm thinking to myself we'll
start with this skyscraper
what's a little ball of fire gonna do to
another wizard I mean
so so they have to write the thing where
the Wizards are all stupid until the end
right then the weather the Wizards use
their magic or something to win it's
like as soon as you've introduced Magic
you can't really write a story about it
because you have to take their magic
away with stupid you know magic reasons
right we should just watch Happy Gilmore
and be done with everything else
so we can't have any uh comedies because
everything's woke
and the action movies are literally all
just the same movie
there's no point in watching them at all
uh no not a fan of Lord of the Rings I
have tried to watch The Lord of the
Rings
but the Lord of the Rings is all just
the same scene over again
strange characters are in danger
uh I guess some Orcs are coming you
better fight them
it's like I I it's just the same scene
repeat it over and over with different
Orcs And different creatures
that's it
um
how about the Matrix The Matrix was
innovative
yeah
The Matrix was Innovative even the fight
scenes in The Matrix were not boring
another one that satisfied me was uh
Crouching Tiger
what's the rest of that
something something
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon because
the fight scenes were fantastic
I mean as in fantasy you know where they
could sort of fly a little bit and you
know they had some cool powers and stuff
all right
all right anything else on uh happening
today
the other trolls
you were hidden
I you know I would love to interview
trolls
so for example there's somebody on
YouTube right now who just now wants to
create new new accounts and say Shelly
Shelly Shelly so he's spending his time
trying to make my live stream less
interesting for other people
and I wonder
how many people are actually wired where
their main operating system is just make
things worse for other people
like who has that as their go-to well I
woke up today
I made something a little harder for
somebody I don't know
I mean he somebody says their wife
and I feel it's like there's some people
who need that that friction in their
life to feel complete
are they abused people they're people
who are abused and they feel they're
abusing me back
Maybe
I feel like I remind people of their
abuser or something
because they're definitely people who
come after me who have some kind of
mental problem they're working through
as in they've been damaged somehow and
they have to hurt me to feel better
somehow
I'm not really following the Brazilian
elections
but I would love to have an actual
conversation with with one of my worst
trolls and see what would happen if I
talk to them in person
and say can you explain to me what
you're trying to accomplish
and I think they would say something
like
you know you deserve it or it's because
of all the bad things you do and then I
would say could you name one and they
won't have any example there will be
literally no example but they'll be
pretty sure that I'm on some team they
don't like so that they have to hurt me
yeah but I'd love to know what's behind
that I don't think it's I don't think
it's exactly Envy
it's like there is a it's mostly a male
thing right
um
it's mostly a male thing so men like to
hurt successful things
it's sort of an Impulse we have
you have an opinion on climate change
is there somebody here so new you don't
know my opinion on climate change
um let me state it clearly in case
somebody doesn't know
I do believe the basic science of
climate change
which is if you add certain stuff to the
atmosphere if everything else stayed the
same it would make it warmer
so I think that's true because I think
that's you you can demonstrate that in
too many ways including in a laboratory
in a test
I think that part is probably true
um I think that the evidence that it's
the sun has been debunked sufficiently
that I ignore that
I do think that like all science we
could be really surprised
maybe tomorrow we find out that the
debunks about the sun were not so
debunking after all maybe we find out
that the people who think it's the Sun
and somehow have never bothered to uh to
Google the debunk you should take five
minutes and just Google whatever you
think is true and then the word debunk
it's it's quite an eye-opener take
anything you think is true and then
Google it with the word debunk
and there it will be
so uh I'm just not a believer that we
can predict a catastrophe
because I think the Innovation
is the part that will save us because it
always does
and I think we're getting closer and
closer to technologies that will
completely solve it
so
um
it does make sense that if you
change the chemistry of the atmosphere
it should make some difference I don't
think that's in question
you were surprised to learn
that we receive no heat from the Sun
what you mean well we receive energy
from the sun which Converses to eat
I guess that's what you mean
all right um
the correlation of solar activity to
Global temperature is solid some people
say so that that's a very common belief
on the right
that if you looked at solar patterns it
would map to warming
but I would ask you again
just to Google that and the word debunk
and you'll find it thoroughly debunked
now if you've never seen the debunks you
need to do it and stop talking about it
if you've read all the debunks and you
believe that you can tell what is true
you know the solar flare idea or the
debunk then I would argue that you're
fooling yourself because you can't tell
you can't tell
uh
somebody says climboscience is bunk
because they've made so many bad uh
predictions in the past you know that's
bad bad thinking right
because everything that works
went through a period sometimes a long
period where it didn't
so nothing could fly
until something did
so we had hundreds of years of people
trying to fly and crashing and dying
until we did
right so is it possible that we were
idiots about climate change for a
hundred years and then science and
science finally caught up and then we
got smarter
you you ruled that out like that's a
that would be a crazy thing that would
be the most normal thing in the world is
that science was wrong for a hundred
years and then finally got smarter
now it is not my opinion that that's
what happened
I'm not telling you that's my opinion
I'm saying that you ruled out the most
common thing
as if the most common thing doesn't
happen no the most common thing happens
the most common thing is that you're bad
at it until you're good at it it's like
everything is like that so it shouldn't
mean anything to you that we were bad at
it for a hundred years
because science has changed a lot in 100
years
you know they're a hundred years ago we
couldn't go to the moon but now we can
now we can
all right
we can hide all the Shelley people who
just can't stop
being
you know you're all just really
I I really can't tell how many of you
are even serious
okay now now I know I was waiting for
somebody who's definitely a troll
to say the Shelley thinks well now I
know you're all trolls
all right you all YouTube you're not
worthy so your goodbye to you
