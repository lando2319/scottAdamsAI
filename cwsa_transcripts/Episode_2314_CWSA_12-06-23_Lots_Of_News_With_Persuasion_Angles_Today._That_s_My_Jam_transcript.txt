good morning
everybody and welcome to the highlight
of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams the best time you've ever
had how would you like to take it up to
levels that even Rob Riner could never
understand just randomly picking his
name um all you need to for that is a
cuper Mugger glass a tanker gelstein a
canteen joer flas vessel of any find
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dope of being
hit of the day the thing that makes
everything better and makes you better
too it's called the simultaneous Happ
happens now
go oh that's
good oh that's so good
yeah well just an update yesterday the
locals platform had a little glitch
um but that was related to a big
technology migration they're doing to
upgrade their their system so when we
get through this little ugly batch might
be a few more bugs but when we get
through that it will be a lot better
much more stable and functional so wait
for that all right well there's lots of
news most of the stories are kind of
small so I'll just pound through them
the Washington Post is having a strike
700 um or more people and it was one of
the writers I think Vanessa
Larson she posted on next that she's so
proud to be among 700 or more Washington
Post colleagues walking out for 24 hours
uh on
Thursday and she asks uh people to
support our walk walk out by not reading
the Washington Post on
Thursday well I can do better than that
I will support you not just Thursday I
will support you for the rest of my life
by not reading the Washington
Post that's right that uh intelligence
based uh intelligence
driven fake news racist
publication that still employees Phil
bump
Phil bump is to The Washington Post what
president gay is to
Harvard an embarrassment to the
institution although I don't know which
is more embarrassing is Phil bump more
insulted by being associated with the
Washington Post or is the Washington
Post more damaged by having him on the
staff H could work both ways all right
uh Starbucks is uh lost a lot of value I
guess in their stock because of
boycotts uh based on some political twe
supporting the Palestinians or something
so I don't even know what Starbucks did
but somehow Starbucks is getting is
getting injured by whatever is happening
in
Gaza it's kind of
crazy um poor Starbucks Boris Johnson is
I guess they're having some kind of a CO
inquiry in the UK to find out what
really happened and who knew what and
all that stuff and former prime minister
Boris Johnson has to explain why 5,000
of his WhatsApp messages from the 2020
plus period
disappeared and Boris says he's not so
sure um some kind of technical thing
maybe something about the app I don't
know maybe it was uninstalled or when it
got reinstalled you know maybe something
like technology and the app and the
something and then the something
happened but maybe maybe a glitch and
maybe the data disappeared something
like that now when I look at Boris
Johnson and I look at his haircut I say
to myself there's a man who never loses
anything I don't know I think that's
hilarious I look at his haircut and I
say there's a man who never loses
anything like his comb for
example or his sense of fashion and
style
for another example all right I'm done
with that but uh I would like to see a
list maybe we could come up with it here
in the comments tell me all the things
that uh the UK government and the
American government have lost that was
important data that the public needed to
see let's see you got your
Epstein uh stuff all things Epstein from
his video cameras then there's the video
of his video cameras of his death those
are those are missing because the
cameras weren't on uh let's see you've
got Hillary's emails they they just sort
of went missing and got destroyed by
Hammers and whatnot you got the January
6 the entire January 6 uh testimonies
all all mysteriously
missing uh what else is
missing yeah oh there there's no video
of show of being attacked in
prison uh at least that we've
seen yeah Jimmy hofa is still
missing um and what about uh what about
the 2020 election are there any any
machines that don't have the data that
they were supposed to store yeah a lot
of election data is missing uh we
haven't seen the UAP videos but I'm sure
they exist but they must be
missing uh yeah the Epstein ja
video
uh yeah that just seems like there's
just a a lot of things
missing just a lot of things
missing
anyway here's a trend you should watch
um so China has a company that's using
AI to build indoor vertical Gardens now
why is this a big deal well indoor
gardens you know greenhouses have been
around forever but they haven't quite
replaced outdoor gardening for basic
economic reasons but you think that
someday they would because your indoor
gardening is going to be uh better on
water you much easier on water it's
going to be better on keeping the
insects out much better it's going to be
potentially better in managing light if
you do it right and uh but the one
problem they had was still space and of
course you got
labor but robots and AI could kind of
solve that for you and also building
vertically so they'll build so instead
of putting everything on the ground
where you run out of space they can just
build shelves and keep going up to the
ceiling now if you have shelves to the
ceiling you've got twice as much work
problem right because you got to get
somebody up there to look around and and
adjust things but if you had a
robot a robot with a couple arms and
some AI the robot would not only know
how much light and water and when to
plant and you know how to get rid of any
weeds if there were any um and and oh
the other benefit is you wouldn't need
insecticide so you'd have less less
chemicals fewer chemicals so basically
indoor garden
should be the way that we go if you can
get it just get the economics down you
know some some little extra every house
you buil would have its own garden
imagine a room in your
house which just has a robot like a
Roomba that's just working all day and
all night just making sure everything's
good in there and it has AI so it can
actually look at your plant and know
what's wrong it can just look at it and
say oh looks like it needs a little
water I think I think the AI plus
vertical shelves
is right at the edge right at the edge
of where it's going to make more sense
to be
indoors I think and then you know maybe
you add little uh you know uh solar
panels to drive the robot and stuff but
I think once your labor goes down to
practically zero and you can use the
space better and then the AI Mak sure
that your your uh your crop is way
better than it would have been it's
going to be a big deal indoor gardens
mark my words Kim Jong-un had a event I
guess he was talking about the women in
North Korea not having enough babies and
he actually
wept he actually cried in public Kim
juned because they weren't having enough
babies now I don't know that just
telling people to have more babies is
going to work when people are starving I
would think that starving and living in
a repressive regime should have the
natural effect of making people want to
have fewer babies so I don't know how
he's going to solve
that um but even Kim Jong-un is probably
seeing that they're in a death
spiral because at their current rate
they will not have enough young people
big problem for
everybody well speaking of countries
have that problem China's got that
problem but beyond that Moody just cut
China's credit out look to negative on
Rising debt risk so I don't know if I've
mentioned this but China is unsafe for
business I don't know if their debt
situations could be worse in the United
States but I feel like there's going to
be some kind of thing happening in the
future that I can't even imagine in
which debt will go
away did you hear uh Warren Buffett's
solution for uh solving our debt problem
he says he could solve it tomorrow
all you do is pass a law that says uh if
you're a member of Congress and you
don't keep our debt below 3%
GDP uh that you automatically are un
unqualified to run for office you you
can't run for reelection if the debt is
above a certain percentage of the GDP
now that's easy to say but of course
nobody's going to pass a bill like that
but even if we had one do you think it
would work
probably not right probably
not all right um our dumbest vice
president is uh reportedly according to
the Wall Street Journal is taking on a
bigger role in advising the White House
on the Israel Hamas War so here are some
of the uh insightful things that uh our
dumus vice president is
recommending now see if anybody ever
thought of these things before these are
these are so
insightful apparently she's pushing
officials to articulate more empathy for
Palestinians well nobody thought of that
before huh empathy for non-combatants
who are dying in a war I've never heard
of that before okay that that might be a
good idea kamla also the most obvious
idea in the history of obvious ideas but
does she have something better than that
does she have something better than the
most obvious idea in the history of
obvious ideas
yes
um they should focus on postconflict
Gaza plan so they should spend more time
talking about rebuilding
Gaza who told you that I did yeah it's
the same advice I've given but it's also
the same advice that Israel would give
you it's the same advice everybody would
give you which is if you don't describe
where you're going it's harder to get
people to want to go there so she's
right but these are the most obvious
things that you could ever
advise and I kind of didn't really need
her for any of
this well in other news uh the xplatform
uh is moving ahead to become a payment
processing app in addition to being
everything else and they've got licenses
now for processing payment ments in in a
dozen US
states but they probably have to get
most of the states or all of them before
they can go live but that's
happening to me that's a really big
deal because you know if you got a
gazillion people on the app and let me
ask how many of you in the course of a
week in a normal
week how many of you would send money on
some digital app whether it's venmo or
Google pay or cash app how many of you
how many of you use any kind of a
digital app at least once a
week and zel yeah zel's one um a lot of
yeses few NOS I don't know how you avoid
it I I feel like I use it almost every
day for one thing or
another yeah well so I think uh putting
the payment thing in tax is going to be
a big deal cuz you're already there all
right um so Nvidia which makes these
Advanced chips which do among other
things they're their perfect chip for AI
but the United States is trying to keep
Nvidia from Shipping their best chips to
China because we don't want China to be
as good as we are at AI could be
dangerous uh but Nidia is arguing that
they can tweak these chips so that
they're you know degraded in some way
and and not as good as
ours but we'll see about that um I guess
China has been as much as 20% of
nvidia's
Revenue um but keep an eye on that do
you think you can really keep China out
of the AI game by making sure that their
chips are not as good as
ours I know I I feel like it's going to
drive China to be to have the room own
chip
manufacturing but why wouldn't they have
it already what what would what would
prevent China from having their own chip
industry is it the is it the equipment
you need to build the
industry that they would have to build
up all kinds of because I guess it's the
same problem in the United States right
the United States doesn't have the chip
industry it used to
have and it's hard to make
it because you know I guess maybe maybe
it's uh trademarks and copyrights and
patents I don't know I don't know what I
just don't know what prevents any a
major industrialized country from making
their own chips I'd love to know what's
so hard about that that only Taiwan can
do
it so we need to more know more about
that um an expert who you should listen
to Bruce uh schneir he's one of these
cyber security expert types and he's got
an editori on slate in which he says
that the era of AI is going to be an era
of mass
spying now what he means by that is that
in the old days you if you had a reason
to spy on one person let's say you had a
a reason to suspect them you could get a
warrant and then you could you know
legally spy in that one person's
Communications but if you have ai you
have the option of sort of just watching
everybody and having the AI summarize
what they're saying and putting it into
some important context as to whether
they might be a terrorist or a
criminal and then what are you going to
do about
it would it be first of all would it be
legal for AI to look through everybody's
Communications and it's not a human
right so it's not a human looking
through Communications but if it finds
something then maybe it would flag it
for the
humans is that
fair well don't we do that
already you're you're talking about the
current situation do you know banks have
been doing that for I don't know 40
years banks have always run software
that doesn't accuse a specific anybody
of anything but it looks at all their
transactions and it looks for anything
that has a uh a pattern that suggests
fraud because there's patterns and when
it sees a pattern it you know surfaces
it for the humans so we've been doing
that
forever and I guess that's legal you
know it's legal for the banks to do it
so I feel like there will be certainly
loopholes where AI can do
it so if I haven't told you this
before stop doing anything
illegal if I have to tell you that
you're you're definitely going to get
caught anything that you're doing
illegal today that you have a a digital
footprint for you're definitely going to
get caught you know maybe this year next
year in four years but you're definitely
going to get caught if if there's any
signs of a crime in your life you're
going to get caught right so you should
immediately adjust all of your illegal
activities to to get rid of them one of
one of the uh predictions I made in the
late '90s
is that technology would eliminate
crime that technology would eliminate
crime and there are several ways I said
that would happen number one was there
would be cheap cameras
everywhere right remember in the '90s I
said the economics of little you video
cameras would go down so much there
would just be a camera everywhere and
sure enough there there's pretty much a
camera everywhere so there's still crime
but the odds of getting away with lots
of different types of crimes is going
the way
down now what if AI can find every
Financial
crime imagine AI looking for insider
trading it could find it every
time like it it's not that easy to find
insider trading with you know normal
mechanisms but imagine AI could find the
brother-in-law's cousin of the person
who had The Insider
information how bet we can't do that now
because the normal way you would get
away with Insider uh trading is you'd
have somebody else do it the dumb way to
do it is to be you know a person in the
company that has The Insider information
and then trade in that a day before the
announcement right you're going to get
caught because the systems do look for
that they look for unusual tra trades
right before big news events but if you
would simply talk to your cousin in
person and said to your cousin hey you
know you're your
brother-in-law that nobody will ever
connect me to because it's too many
jumps tell them to buy a little bit of
this and by the way you know I might be
asking that brother-in-law's cousin for
a favor someday so you can work things
out so there's a system of benefit that
that just never shows up on paper but AI
could find it CU they know who your
cousin is and they know your cousin's
friend made a trade and suddenly you
know this this uh you know hiding stuff
doesn't work now remember Hunter Biden
had all these um shell
corporations now that worked because
nobody was looking for it as soon as
they were looking for it they could
start to unwind it all but if if you
weren't looking for it you weren't going
to discover it but could AI look for it
could you could AI have enough access to
enough databases in other countries Etc
that it could find all the um illicit
corporate structures and also figure out
how they connect to each other and just
draw up the crime maybe maybe so I think
we're reaching that point I suggested
where you know we might be dumb enough
to let the criminals out that's a
different story but we'll have the
ability to basically catch any
crime I don't know how you get away with
anything all right um but Mass spying
yeah that's definitely coming Taylor
Swift is the person of the
year on Time Magazine now did you ever
think that Time Magazine was making
their choices based on you know
objective criteria let me explain how
the media
Works Time Magazine makes their decision
who who is the person of the year not
because it's necessarily the best choice
or or what the customers would think
sometimes it's just marketing for the
magazine sometimes they're just being
provocative and they know it so that you
will say to yourself my God how could
they say that I'm going to have to read
their argument and you buy the magazine
so you should see it as marketing
first but Time Magazine might have a
political bias as well and I would ask
do you think there's any political
meaning giving that this is a
presidential political year coming up
that having Taylor Swift on the cover
would would that be any kind of a
political message in addition to just
being good marketing for time well maybe
um here's a post by Jack bobic says the
uh the Taylor Swift girl boss scop
H is it a girl boss
scop has been fully activated from her
hand selected vaccine shill boyfriend to
her dink lifestyle DN K is uh
um uh dual income no kids dual income no
kids life style to her upcoming 2024
voter operation for Democrats on
abortion rights it's all
coming yeah it does look a little bit
like she's being let's say groomed by
the media to be a good you know powerful
political spokesperson for young people
now do you think that Taylor Swift could
cause young people to vote her way
because she's Taylor Swift do you think
she can move
votes what do you
think yes yes she could absolutely yeah
now you know maybe not completely by
yourself but it would only take a few of
your Heroes to be on the same side
before you say hey that's the that's the
third hero of mine that's on the same
side I guess I'm on that side too yes
yes she could move the dial she is she
is that
powerful
so that might have a political component
to it either intentionally or
not um so if you're watching the
situation in Ireland and saying to
yourself hey that uh the tech censorship
issues that are happening in Ireland
right now that doesn't affect us and if
you're saying oh there there complaints
against the immigration issue there that
doesn't affect us well apparently
there's a a bill that's being considered
in
Ireland uh that would require
corporations to to show that they had
taken all reasonable steps and exercise
due
diligence uh to avoid the con the uh H
having bad content basically ha speech I
guess
so like most things it's the it's the
side effect that you worry about you
know it's not the it's not what it says
in the surface is what's going to happen
after that what's going to happen after
that Michael shellenberger is sounding
the alarm is if one country succeeds in
getting the big um platforms to censor
who they want them to censor otherwise
lose their ability to operate in that
country then the other countries are
going to do it right away and they will
exert control over their social medias
as Ireland did if Ireland
succeeds and and this would be the end
of free speech basically because if the
governments can exercise this power you
don't need all the governments to do it
you just need enough
governments to say you have to censor
before it it just becomes easy for
everybody to do it all the governments
to do
it so yeah that's a big deal um and
Conor
McGregor famous uh UFC fighter is is
actually kind of serious about running
for president and could actually in my
opinion his popularity is you know
Taylor Swift like he could actually win
could actually
win all right here's another uh factoid
Reed Hoffman one of the biggest donors
to Democrats reportedly gave a qu
million dollars to a Nicki hilly super
pack so you ask yourself why would the
biggest or one of the biggest he might
be the biggest now that there other
biggest donors are having some troubles
uh but Reed Hoffman why would he give
money to a republican if he's one of the
biggest Democrats
donors
andake posted well this makes
sense yeah because have you noticed that
uh Nikki hilly is sort of overperforming
she seems like she's doing better than I
expected well maybe she's got more money
that might help and
why would Reed
Hoffman fund her is it because it's an
anything but Trump uh so if he can get
an get an anti-trumper elected not an
anti-trumper but a anybody but Trump
that's good but if he can get a Democrat
elected that's even better or is he just
creating trouble in the Republican party
is it just a so chaos in the Republicans
I don't know quar billion dollarss uh
here's what I can tell you about Reed
Hoffman So Not only was he you know
founder of LinkedIn and a big
billionaire but um he's one of the
pioneers of social media in general and
specifically what he pioneered was the
understanding of human behavior and
addiction like how to give somebody to
really really like going back to the
platform and how to get a network effect
working Etc now he's one of the uh
so-called PayPal Mafia uh the people
like Peter teal and Elon Musk and uh
David Sachs and Reed Hoffman so they
were all part of that PayPal original
startup here's the thing I always say
about that group the one thing that that
group has in common to a scary degree is
the understanding of human
psychology and I would argue that they
know that better than any any small
group of people you've ever seen
consistently their understanding of how
people operate like how the brain works
is really the secret to all their
success you know what what makes the
service viral what makes you impossible
to leave a service it's all that stuff
you know the Elon Musk making his first
Tesla you know super
fast just so people would be excited by
it the the uh ludicrous mode in the
current Teslas completely unnecessary
completely unnecessary it just makes it
irresistible to a certain kind of buyer
so yeah Reed Hoffman is more than just a
big
donor he
is
probably one of their biggest persuasion
experts so if you see a persuasion play
coming out of the Democrats probably
Reed Hoffman thought it was a good idea
because if he thought it was a bad idea
he's probably influential enough to stop
it and he's probably smart enough to
suggest good ideas so if you're looking
for who are the sometimes people ask me
this you know if if robbert Chini is not
involved in politics this time and I
think he was looking to retire from that
uh if he's not who on who on the side of
the Democrats is
their um persuasion expert
and I would look at Reed Hoffman as not
just a rich guy given money and not just
a brilliant
entrepreneur but he might be their
persuasion expert he might be the one so
I'm keeping a persuasion eye on him by
the way I like Reed Hoffman i' I've met
him and uh he's a great guy had a very
good very good personal interaction he
was very kind to me uh he has different
political preferences but I don't don't
fault him for
that so yeah he's a good guy anyway
um Facebook and meta getting some heat
for having too much sexual content for
young people there's some kind of a
civil lawsuit being filed in New
Mexico and doesn't it just Boggle your
mind that the xplatform was singled out
for their advertisement too close to
content that people don't like and none
of it was true it was way more true on
the platform that backs the Democrats
way more true but of course the truth
doesn't matter it's a political season
so the truth doesn't
matter all right uh in California a new
law is going into effect in January 1st
so California retailers will be fined
for not having gender neutral toy
section for
kids you'll actually be
fine if your toys are for boys and or
girls or I guess if it just looks
obvious it's for boys or for girls now
aren't there a lot of toys that are just
naturally gender
neutral I I thought that was already the
case AR aren't most aren't most things
gender neutral maybe not most for
kids but um
this looks like just uh just begging for
lawsuits for no good
reason and what what would that look
like anyway how if you labeled it how
would you label it would it be toys for
boys toys for girls and toys for
undecided or toys for
non-binary like how would you even call
it
out toys non-gender toys or
something I feel like everything is just
designed to make it harder to be in
business without getting
sued yeah non- tuckable swimsuits I
don't know I don't know what they do but
that looks like a ridiculous overreach
by
government so apparently Hunter Biden
has something that the news is calling
his sugar
brother sugar brother somebody who gives
him money we don't know what this guy's
getting in return we can only imagine
but um apparently Hunter is received
$4.9 million from one Hollywood lawyer
Kevin Morris in a three-year
period now I don't know about your
friends I've never had a friend who
would give me5 million for basically
nothing in return but boy do I wish I
did I wish I had a friend like that but
when I say for nothing in return that's
that's unfair because uh some of it is
that he bought Hunters are at
work so I'm sorry I probably I should
correct myself uh I exaggerated it's not
that he gave $5 million for
nothing some amount of it was loans
according to hter there were
loans could somebody uh get me a copy of
the loan agreement or I'm just going to
guess I'll bet you when he's asked for
the loan agreements he's going to say
they're missing possibly lost lost or
missing anybody want to take the other
side of that bed that the loan documents
they definitely existed but I don't know
it might be in my WhatsApp messaging
that reset itself somehow kind of an app
kind of a bug I uninstalled an app and
now my files are all gone yeah I think
something like that something like
that's going to
happen so I guess Hunter does use this
trick of saying something
alone and then uh avoiding
taxes you realize of course that at some
point if you said something's a
loan uh and you don't ever pay it back
as some point you still have to call
that income don't
you if you never pay it back actually I
don't know the answer to that question
if anybody's an IRS expert let's say you
let's say you legitimately received a
loan and you actually had paperwork for
it and then you just didn't pay it back
does it ever count as
income if it's obvious once it becomes
obvious there's no intention to ever to
pay it back and maybe you have the money
you just and that maybe that's the key
you have the money it's clearly clearly
true you have the money to pay it back
but you just
don't does it become income at that
point
point or does it become just bad news
for the person who gave you the
loan from a banking perspective if
somebody defaulted it wouldn't be income
if you simply defaulted because you
couldn't afford it that doesn't become
income that's just a defaulted loan but
if it's clear you never had documents 10
years of going by you've never made an
interest payment you've made no attempt
to pay it back wouldn't the IRS
reclassify that as a loan
eventually if oh somebody says if you
default on a credit card it counts as
income oh I'm seeing opinions that
people are saying that it does count as
income interesting could have gone
either way I didn't know how that was
going to
go all right well these are these are
comments on social media so uh talk to
your accountant before you take my tax
advice or anybody else's so what do you
think of this is there any reason that
this one Hollywood lawyer would be
giving millions of dollars to one person
who by the way they were not childhood
friends this guy started giving Hunter
Millions within you know a few years of
meeting
him now that's a friend all
right uh FBI director Ray was testifying
in Congress and Senator Mike Lee went
after him
hard um about the alleged changes in the
processes to keep Americans safe from um
illegal you know fising stuff I guess
and uh the trouble is that the FBI can't
I guess they can't be too specific about
what they
changed it it's sort of a uh trust us we
changed everything and now it's good so
Mike Lee just went off on them and it's
really good because because you know
sometimes you say to yourself oh these
are just you know all the politicians
are just trying to do their moment so it
becomes a viral thing so it looks like
they're doing their
job honestly Mike Le looked like a human
being who was really
mad it didn't to me it didn't come off
as you know
grandstanding he just came off as a
pissed off human being which is why I
recommend it you know I wouldn't
recommend you know somebody
gives their little speech in Congress
cuz they're just trying to be a star but
he didn't look like that I mean that's
just the way I I'm not reading his mind
I'm just saying that that was the
impression I guy he looks sincere like a
like a human who's being abused just
like the rest of us and he was talking
just like you would if you could have
talked freely it's like Jesus you don't
even let us see it we have no reason to
believe you're different I mean he just
went off on them it was interesting to
see
all right well bill lman um famous
investor bill lman has been going super
hard on the presidents of the colleges
that have allowed the uh anti-semitic
stuff to
happen
and uh so here's a post for him today he
says does calling for the genocide of
Jews violate uh your University's code
of conduct or rules regarding bullying
bullying or harassment now he's talking
about the fact that three presidents of
three colleges Harvard University of pen
and MIT were hauled in by Congress to
explain why they weren't uh either all
quitting or or being fired or removed by
the boards for allowing what uh most
observers are saying looks anti-semitic
which is they're allowing the
anti-jewish
voices to intimidate the Jewish students
in a bullying
clearly threatening way they should not
exist in any campus today so Bill
amman's going after him and I guess the
the three presidents all all answered
the question of does calling for the
genocide of Jews violate your College's
code of conduct all three
female um presidents of those un or
those colleges said it depends on the
context oh my God
it depends on the
context now here's my take it does
depend on the context so technically of
course everything depends on context but
what doesn't is there something that
doesn't depend on context of course it
does right you know let's say the
context was um somebody was giving a
speech about what you should never do in
public well that context would matter
because it would mean that what they
said was the opposite of what they
thought was true so yeah context matters
but in in the real world is there ever
going to be a context where this
matters I mean really is there ever
going to be a context that makes this
okay ever and would this ever be okay in
any context if any other you know ethnic
group were involved no of course not
well maybe white people in general or
white men but any other group no it be
inappropriate so there's uh continued
calls for those three College professors
or college uh presidents to be fired by
their boards will it happen I doubt it I
don't think any of them will be fired do
you nope no
way all right um there was a study that
the uh I think it was the end wokeness
account on on X it's a great account to
follow finds a lot of good stuff so
there was a national
election um studies in
2021 national election studies was the
name of the the study and in 2021 they
looked at racial groups and how they
raided each
other uh and how they raided themselves
so they asked uh separately they asked
the black
Asian-American um Hispanic Americans and
white people in America how do you rate
your own group yeah how awesome do you
think you are and then how do you rate
the other three
groups well the findings of this
study yeah assuming the stud's right we
don't know but the studies seem to
indicate that white people uh on average
of course we're not talking about every
person it's always these are just
averages that they tended to rate
themselves other white people as well as
Hispanic black and Asian Americans
that's about the same so white people
said white people ah we're average how's
everybody else about the same so nobody
was special nobody was disavowed nobody
was put on a pedestal just everybody's
about the same so basically white people
have been buying into the Melting Pot
you know everybody's the same we're all
equal kind of narrative how the other
groups
do uh not so good turns out that the
other groups think that they're pretty
awesome but white people
suck
so bet you didn't see that coming or did
you now I gave some advice here um if
you believe that this study is accurate
and you believe that white people
generally are not uh biased against
other people on average but that other
groups might have a very low opinion of
you if you're
white don't do anything about it that's
my advice don't mention it in
public don't bring up that there's a
study that suggests maybe there's a a
way to act that would keep you safer if
you were white because you will be very
cancelled if you point that out so what
you should do um the only ethical thing
as I I've been told I didn't know this
at first but I've learned this the only
moral and ethical thing to do if you're
a white person is to uh continue
associating with people who have a low
opinion of
you because to do otherwise would be
racist so that's your advice
okay uh V posted today truth number one
January 6 now looks more and more like
entrapment well that's pretty Direct
so a major candidate for president who
is not
Trump is saying directly the January 6
looks more like entrapment why well
there are now more videos coming out
that show uh multiple instances of
police calmly removing barriers to let
the crowd into the capital
grounds calmly and repeatedly removing
barriers that are
working this is this is the key point
the barriers were working the people
were on the other side of it and they
were sort of respecting the barrier
because there were police there and the
police actually removed the barriers and
let them in then we've also seen
multiple in interior uh security cameras
they show that the people look more like
tourists they were just wandering
respectfully staying between the lines
and the uh law enforcement was
high-fiving and
and basically just letting them do their
thing cuz they they either didn't think
they would be violent or they were in on
something we don't know what they were
thinking or why they did it we just know
what
happened so do we have let let's get a
uh let me test the temperature of my
audience in the comments do you think
it's a fair statement that January 6 now
looks more and more like
entrapment that and we're also not told
the number of uh undercover informants
or whatever in the
crowd so we're told that we're not going
to be told how many were the ENT
Trappers the alleged ENT Trappers uh but
let's just call them the undercover of
people we're not told that number the
public can't know that
number now what do I tell you about the
government If This Were an
individual and an indiv idual said I
have some information I'm not going to
tell you I say
unambiguously well I don't know what
that person did but innocent till proven
guilty definitely innocent innocent
innocent by our system which is a really
good system until proven guilty I don't
care how I don't care how guilty it
sounds it can sound guilty but you got
to prove that that's the rule but
not for the government if the government
doesn't tell you something you can infer
their
guilt totally appropriate it's logical
it might not be right but you can infer
that they've given you reason to believe
they're
guilty and you can act on it you know
within the law as a citizen you can act
on
um so yeah I agree with vake and I would
say I would I didn't start here I did
not start out believing that there were
enough FBI informance to make a
difference I didn't start there I always
knew it was an interesting question but
I didn't have the data to you know
firmly say one way or the other and I
didn't assume that just because we knew
that maybe one or two doors had been
opened or you know maybe some police
officers acted in a certain way or you
know maybe Ray EPS was still still a
question mark I didn't think that that
was yet enough to put it together say oh
well maybe it's exactly what it looks
like but but in the fullness of time
when we can see the complete catalog of
dirty tricks and intelligence Ops we can
see the full bag of dirty tricks from
the Democrats in general we can see
their desperation to hold on to power
and we can see that they were uh trying
to paint Mega people as domestic
terrorists if you look at their um motiv
ation they have the motive they have the
motive for the crime did they have the
time to prepare for it they had time to
prepare because they knew it was coming
um would it be
unprecedented no it would not it it
would be well within the normal behavior
but usually it's something you see
America in instigating in another
country so it's normal for America to do
it to other countries and we also know
now that it's
normal and routine for America to take
tricks which they've applied only to
other countries and apply it
domestically we see this with the
censorship Etc it's obvious right so
we've got the motivation we've got the
means you know they have the
resources we've got uh a full full
umbrella of supporting
interests we've got a full map of all
the players so we can see who's
connected to who and it all looks
exactly like the says it looks and now
we have an increasing number of
anecdotal still anecdotal but you know
little bits of why is this police offic
are acting this way why is this one
opening this gate why is this one just
standing
aside if you put it all
together I I'm going to state that at
this point the burden of proof has to be
on the government to prove
innocence right the burden of proof on
the government when you've done when
there are this many signals they have to
prove it didn't happen it's not like a
citizen where they'd have to prove it
did happen they have to prove it didn't
happen and at this point your working
assumption your working assumption this
doesn't mean you're right but the
correct working assumption is that it's
exactly what it looks like and it was
entrapment and vake sees the same thing
you do that is the correct working
assumption even if it turns out not to
be true which I would love I would I
would love that the government could
tell you how many operators were there
let you interview them or let the Press
interview them let you see any documents
that were you know part of the decision
making and then maybe there's nothing
there but when you act this
guilty the working assumption has to be
guilt that's exactly what it looks
like all
right um Thomas Massie getting some push
back from a number of people uh Charles
Schumer Chuck
Schumer he was reacting to uh massie's
post I'll tell you what his post was in
a minute but he said
uh uh what did it mean well Massie just
says it was anti-semitic now I'm going
to tell you what Thomas Massie posted
and I want you to
see uh how uh how anti-semitic it looks
to
you all
right uh so he posted a meme in which
the uh rapper Drake is shown in two
pictures and he he's putting up a hand
like you know no more of that or you
know don't give me that kind of stop it
hand and and one of them says uh uh what
did it say
uh uh Zionism so at first he's saying uh
oh no he's first saying approvingly yes
to Zionism but then he's looking
disapprovingly and then the word say uh
uh uh American patriotism so massie's
post showed a
uh what looked like a conflict between
uh what Congress was doing for Zionism
versus America now here's how I
interpreted it and and I'll let you tell
me how I'm interpreting it wrong I
interpreted it that he wants the
American Congress to use American money
first for things that are uh primarily
America Centric and not so much for
something that's directly Israel Centric
and the country of Israel uh being part
of that definition of
Zionism now if an American politician
says we should spend money on our own
country instead of another country even
an ally even a strong Ally even you know
one of our favorite
allies that he would still prefer as our
elected representative that we spend it
on American interest more directly
although I do understand that America
has an interest in in Israel's you know
well-being but it's a second order
effect you know the the first order is
do you have any money that's more
important than how you spend it do you
have any and we don't you know Massie
would say we'd have to borrow that money
so um here's what I learned from this if
you use that zword Z IO n apparently
there's another interpretation of it
that I can't find in a
definition so when I look at the
definition of the words in this
controversy I see uh Massie using the
zword to refer to the nation of Israel
and protecting
it is that racist it refers to the
formation of the nature of the nation of
Israel and then protecting that Nation
what's what's the anti-semitic part what
am I
missing can somebody fill me
in I mean I I honestly don't
know right there there are plenty of
people who are Jewish who don't approve
of Zionism meaning they don't approve of
Israel having you know I guess a Jewish
state so there there's somebody who
disagrees with everything right there's
no issue that you don't have
disagreement on so everybody there's
always going to be somebody disagreeing
with
everything does anybody have any
idea why the word the
zword is all if you don't agree
with
prioritizing Israel over the United
States are you
automatically
anti-semitic is it because here's here's
my best hypothesis I'll see if any if
this Rings true
there there is a second well let's say
there's an alternative use of that
zword by people who are unambiguously
racists and see it part of a global
conspiracy but that's not the de the
dictionary definition the dictionary
definition is not what the worldwide
conspiracy theorists are saying that's
their own definition or their own usage
of it the the common usage of it is the
formation of Israel and then the support
of it as a Jewish State isn't it isn't
that the that's the definition
right and I actually looked for the
definition because I thought maybe I
maybe there was an element to the
definition I didn't get but here's my
best
take my best take is that of course
Thomas Massie is not using it in a anti-
itic way okay let me just say
this Thomas Massie did it you think he
did an anti-semitic
post like this soon after October
7th an elected member of Congress you
think he did an
unambiguous anti-semitic post which he
knew he was doing really yeah really
really you could you actually stand in
front of me and tell me you believe
that but here here's my best um my best
defens of Schumer all right so let me
steal man this is that the right word so
I'm going to take Schumer's point of
view and argue with the best I
can uh it is true that people who are
definitely
anti-semitic have used the word Zion as
as a integral part of their
anti-semitic you know larger messaging
is that
true can can we agree on that that the
people who are unambiguously
anti-semitic especially online use the
z-word as part of their anti-semitic
messaging so if you are associating with
that group in any way like even by using
their
wording well that's maybe a little
suggestive of
anti-Semitic because you're borrowing
their language I can see that I I I
could see why somebody would ask you to
disavow the post but that's really
different from being anti-semitic so I
don't believe that even
Schumer believes that Massie is
anti-Semitic he's talking about the
choice of how to message would you agree
with that that even Schumer is not
saying he is anti-Semitic he simply
objecting to the messaging because it's
too suggestive of a a world in which
which they use that word too much in the
worst way but here's the
thing Massie is not an
idiot he's just using words the way
words words are
used
so um I
get and here's the other thing you need
to know now this applies to my situation
of my own cancelling but also almost all
the other
cancelling it's never about the person
who gets cancelled
um the public and the and the political
players they use stories about um public
figures to attach their messaging to so
it's never really about the public
figure none of this is about Thomas
Massie it's about the fact that some
people want to make sure you know that
they're as supportive as they could be
of the Jewish community and they want
you to know that they won't tolerate
anything that looks even suggestive of
being on the other
side so the way to interpret it is has
nothing to do with Thomas Massie because
it legitimately has nothing to do with
Thomas Massie he just used English words
the way they're used in the way he likes
to use them everybody understood exactly
what he meant there was no confusion
about what he meant or who he is but
still
 can can turn it into something
because it's easy to
do so
um but also here here's the other thing
you should be aware of um this is a hot
War right this is not theoretical Israel
is at
War and they're right in the thick of it
here's what I would not ask you to
assume don't don't assume that people
are being objective observers of
anything there's no objectivity
happening here and if you try some
objectivity you're going to get your ass
handed to you right so a lot of the
messaging pro and con of everything is
more about do you support
Israel right so this is the point where
um any any little diversion from the
perfect messaging in favor of Israel is
going to get a lot of scrutiny I'm
surprised it hasn't happened to me
yet you know I've said from the start
I'm 100% um backing Israel and my my
reasons are
easy my reasons are
easy it's what any country would
do any country who would experience what
they did on October 7th would respond
same way if they could you know if they
had the military might to do it so
having an opin opinion on it to me just
seemed like a waste of time it's just
going to happen my opinion isn't going
to change anything so um I'm
100% understanding of it and supportive
of it
um but I don't I don't know that that'll
protect me because you realize the first
second I say something that that could
be interpreted as off
message the ADL will come after me right
like you can't be 100% in favor of
Israel and still be
safe you're just not a safe and I think
Massie is an example that he's uh anyway
there enough about
that all right
um as Mike covich has pointed
out um I'll just read his his post he
said Bill Amman and the Harvard donors
are are the leading indicators of
2024 he will never openly support Trump
talking about Amman uh not the point
even Trump haters see a huge mess
meaning the country um imagine what most
Americans are thinking and
then uh Mike finishes in his usual
provocative way he says that's why the
regime is using media apparat aaric to
incite
assassination
hyperbole is that too
far is that an
exaggeration do you do you think the
Democrats have an intentional strategy
of getting uh Trump
assassinated uh because it's the only
way they can
stop an obvious train that's under of
control which is their own train but
they don't want they don't want
Republicans to stop it they want to I
guess keep the train
going um I agree with this completely
and I'm going to I'm going to add some
weight to
it here's some weight uh Rob
Riner says that Trump would be the end
of
democracy Rob Riner yeah who's the head
of an organization that includes some
former CIA members on it some say
without evidence that Rob Riner might be
part of the deep State blob and not just
a person with an
opinion some say
but if that were true I don't know that
that's true I know that he acts exactly
like he's part of the deep State I don't
know that it's true I just know his
actions are consistent with it and if it
were and he says it's the end of
democracy what does that signal to
you well by itself it would just be
political blah blah blah right because
people say stuff like that but when you
say it about Trump and it's in the
context of all this other stuff that I'm
going to mention it does feel like a
call to
assassination it does because if you can
tell people that Trump is bad enough
he's enough of a Hitler dictator Tyrant
then you can make the case that there's
nothing that's out of bounds to stop him
nothing's out of bounds so look for this
in their messaging nothing's and abounds
they won't say that but they will say
well he might murder your children so
you know do what you have to
do you know it's going to look like
that all right what else uh Liz Cheney
warns that a vote for Trump quote May
mean the last election that you get to
vote in ah so Liz Cheney says that you
will probably lose your
country if you let if you let him win
but what does um Joe Biden say is there
anything scary
sounding uh he says
uh we cannot let him
win we cannot let Trump win that's an
interesting way to word it isn't
it usually usually it's something like
uh we have to you know we have to fight
to win if he wins you know it'll be a
bad country but if I win it'll be good
but that phrase We cannot let him win
does that sound like permission to do
anything to keep him from if you
cannot that seems like it's going Beyond
preference cannot is a decision see the
difference we don't want him to win as a
preference our team would do better as a
preference he'd do a bad job as a
preference I'd do a good job as a
preference he has bad policies that's a
preference I have good policies that's a
preference we cannot
let him win is a decision that's not a
preference that is allowing
anything we
cannot cannot is a really strong and and
it feels
like feels like you meant
it I swear to God we just have to have
the all caps filter if I read you the
the stuff that the that the all caps
people are saying on YouTube you would
just laugh it's like why do you label
yourself as a
idiot like why would you label yourself
hi I'm a idiot look at my all
cap statement oh oh
oh all
right
um so the uh Democrat
Playbook um is they're going to go after
the following things from the
Republicans so here here's their attack
on the
Republicans um they're going to go after
the potential for a National Abortion
ban because Republicans talk about that
apparently Trump has wisely refused to
engage on that
question which is the right political
stance and uh as others have pointed out
assuming that Democrats still have some
power in Congress I don't see how there
would ever be a National Abortion ban do
you how how in the world would Congress
change so much that you could get a vote
for a National Abortion ban does that
even sound like something that could
happen you know don't say whether you'd
like it or not but is it
possible it doesn't seem like it but
it's a good political um it's a good
political
Club because to the extent that
Democrats think it could
happen it's a good it's a good
approach um I don't know they say that
you know Trump will cut climate funding
he probably
will and then they say he'll undercut
and attack American
democracy this is coming from some de
Democrat
uh adviser all right uh and he's going
to punish his political
opponents and be a dictator so Trump
does this town hall thing on Hannity
he's asked the question about being a
dictator do you remember what I told
you I told you that he should uh he
should mock people for the for that idea
you just laugh at him he did not do that
instead he he makes it so hard to to
support him instead he said I'll only be
a dictator for the first
day come
on come
on C can you give me can you give me any
little relief
here can can you possibly give me a
chance of surviving the next year like I
feel like I'm going to get
assassinated right if I say two more
good things about him and he says one
more thing about being a dictator for
the first day I feel like I'm going to
get assassinated can you try a little
harder to keep me alive for the next
year are you kidding me don't say
you're going to be a dictator the first
day but only the first day only the
first day
now was he joking of course of course he
was joking but when it gets requoted or
just quoted you don't get the joke part
you don't get that he wasn't taking it
any of it seriously so of course the
news today is that he says yeah I'm
going to be a dictator on the first day
they're literally quoting him as saying
I'm going to be a dictator on day one
because he actually said that but then
he said you know only day one cuz you
know give some stuff done or
whatever and it didn't even make
sense it didn't make sense because he
wouldn't have to be a dictator
you know if he actually has the powers
to do the things he wants to do he
doesn't need to be a dictator why would
he say that why why come on make it a
little bit easier for us huh a little
bit all right well I think he'll
probably Trend in the right direction on
that
um
yeah yeah I I think he get he needs to
be funnier in mocking it
he he needs he needs to make sure
everybody knows that he thinks you're
you're an idiot for thinking it here
here would be the way I'd explain it you
want to hear the fastest persuasive
argument for how he will not become a
dictator all right here it goes become a
dictator I've been president for four
years do you know how hard it is to get
anything done do you know how many
people would have to be involved in in
any small decision even the smallest
thing has to be approved by this miles
of bureaucracy do you know how many of
the bureaucracy are Trump supporters
mostly not mostly not you've got a whole
government of people who are against me
who work for me how in the world am I
going to become a dictator when I can't
even get an executive order passed that
doesn't get reversed in a few months by
the next president how in the world I
couldn't I couldn't even get the
National Guard to protect the capital on
January 6th how in the world do I become
a dictator can somebody can somebody
tell me that plan like if I if I make a
phone call and tell somebody to do some
dictator stuff in your world do they go
do it in my world it starts this big or
uh this big bureaucratic process which
stops everything from
happening I I can't even do easy things
I can't even do things you want do you
know what I else I can't get done I
can't build up a wall and most of you
want
one think about that not only can I not
take over the country by
talking by
talking I'm not going to become a
dictator because I talk myself into it
and talk you into it you would need the
entire function and structure and and
the military to somehow be on the same
side of that I can't even get I can't
even get Congress to do the things that
most of the people in the world want to
be done I can't even get easy things
done how in the world am I going to take
over the
country by posting on
Truth he's not even on X he's not even
on social media he's only on his own
social media how in the world is he
going to take over the country I mean to
me that's just
funny and here's why that's persuasive
because as soon as you say the
bureaucracy is so thick that I can't
even do things that all of you want me
to do you'd be
done wouldn't you the moment you hear
that you go okay that's kind of
true if you can't even get things done
that we want to be done how in the world
could you overthrow the country just
because you thought it was a good
idea
yeah and here's an even better one you
want one that nobody would ever stop
talking
about he he'll never say this but it
would be
awesome let me explain something to you
imagine Trump saying this if I tried to
become a dictator Don Jr would kill
me
done done junor would murder me and you
know
what maybe you
would maybe he would if he said a vonka
would kill me I think I'd believe that
too because you know what ianka and Don
Jr are Patriots and they would actually
care about their country probably more
than one person even their
father now you could argue about whether
that's true or not
right but you would never forget it if
he ever said something like that you
could never get it out of your head and
by the and people would joke about it
you know they would joke about forever
oh donu is going to kill you for
this but I think and wouldn't it be
funny if Don Jr confirmed
it imagine Trump saying it and then you
know everybody has to talk to Don junor
is like would you would you that's crazy
would you and imagine him saying
absolutely
absolutely
absolutely but just imagine
that because it's also I think probably
true I think I could kill a family
member if they became
Hitler I hate to admit it but I probably
could all
right here are a few things uh oh and
also they're going to say Trump Wants
Revenge uh Steve Bannon and probably
others will be saying this that that's a
good thing and you know we should maybe
keep boosting that message that Trump
wants to get revenge because in this in
this instance he would be getting
revenge against people who had done
truly bad things not just to him but to
the rule of law and to the Integrity of
the country I just don't like that
word I don't like that
word
yeah
revenge is not really uh a good
political word um I would like uh now
when Bannon talks about that word he
does Define it as you know holding
people accountable and Prosecuting
criminals so he's very careful to say
I'm only talking about people who did
crimes I'm not I'm not talking about
innocent people we're just talking about
literally
criminals but it's a bad look it's a bad
look I think something more like justice
would work better however it is the
primaries and you know if it were more
of a fight in the primary I'd say use
those fighting words that might get
people uh excited but I think Trump
needs to be already priming toward the
general election would you
agree
Trump's um candidacy should already be
more toward the middle cuz he doesn't
need to worry too much unless he go to
jail or as a health problem he doesn't
have to worry too
much about the nomination unless
something changes but is the debate
tonight oh thanks for reminding me um
there there's some news today that I
never thought I'd have to
say now I want you to sit down to hear
this this this might come as a a
personal shock to some of you so that
this will affect you personally
and I I just want to say it
once if you weren't aware of
this you
died yeah you
died and it's tragedy that you
died oh I'm sorry not why not why OU
died no no no uh his name is James uh U
yo and he was in that exploding house in
Arlington they say uh which answers my
question which is how can you be in a
house that completely explodes and
survive it but apparently you died so
you died
sorry
um that's right and when he knocked on
the door and they said who's there he
said yeah you know you know the rest of
it okay uh here's two things to
understand about
persuasion talking about this slow
motion assassination attempt on Trump
which does look exactly like that so now
you see that all the the people who are
the trained um the trained monkeys who
say the things you're supposed to say
are going to say he's a
dictator and he's uh going to be Hitler
and uh he wants revenge and he's coming
after you he's going to take away your
democracy your democracy is going to be
taken away now
here's the things you need to know
persuasion wise it is not possible to
hypnotize somebody to commit
murder right it's been tried it's been
tested no matter how good you are as a
hypnotist and no matter who the person
is you're hypnotizing you cannot
hypnotize them to take a gun and go
shoot somebody if they believe the gun
really has really bull real bullets in
it sometimes they'll do it because they
think it's just an experiment and a
trick and they think the gun does
doesn't have real bullets but of course
the gun does not have real bullets
because it's just a
test so the people who do take the gun
and and go to shoot somebody it's not
because they're hypnotized it's because
they know they nobody would ever give
you a loaded gun until you to shoot an
innocent person so the tests are it's
hard to test it but there's no there's
no example of anybody who's been
hypnotized to do harm to
somebody
however you can bring brainwash an
entire segment of the public into
thinking somebody else is
Hiller and then you just wait you end up
the same result you just don't know
which individual ends up deciding that
they need to take matters into their own
hands so you are actually watching in my
professional opinion a slow motion
assassination of President Trump
attempted an attempted assassination and
it's being led by the Atlantic The
Washington Post CNN MSNBC and all The
Usual Suspects and I do believe that
they are aware as cernovich calls it
down they are aware that they have done
such a bad job with the I'll say the
fabric of American
civilization that they can't possibly
win in a straightup vote and if they
can't win in a straightup vote and
here's why it's such a problem that uh
Trump is threatening them if they don't
win they think they might go to jail do
you know why they think they might go to
jail because they've done crimes in some
cases and then there are people who
maybe didn't do crimes but they're
worried that they would get blamed of a
crime they didn't do I wonder if that's
ever happened to somebody named Trump 91
times this
year yeah so why would why do you think
Democrats would be concerned about a
government arrest passing them for
charges that are
 huh huh I wonder if they've
been
involved being on the side that is
arresting people for you know
like January
6th and 91 charges against Trump for so
far
nothing
yeah so yeah I can see why they'd be
worried that some that the government
would ever come after somebody on Trump
tub charges now I would not support
Trump doing anything like that I would
be very very much seriously against any
Republican president who is doing
political
prosecutions I hope I I hope I would be
wise enough to recognize it though
because the problem is you always think
that the other side is a criminal but
whatever they do to your team is a
political Witch Hunt it's just natural
you think that way I hope I would be
wise enough to know if Republicans did
that kind of thing to
Democrats I haven't seen it so I haven't
seen a signal for it but I worry I worry
that I'm not tuned to it that I would
miss it and that's a big problem because
you don't want your side to do that
either so I uh let me assure
Democrats if you need it that I would be
on your side if uh anything Trump or any
other the Republican did look like a
purely um political prosecution I I
could not back that and I would uh and I
would also believe that that would be a
big enough problem to impeach a
president so if if Trump did something
that looked like political
prosecutions impeachments on the table
yeah it's you got to be serious about
that you you can't take that as
team play that can never be team play
that's just got to be the American
play would a special prosecutor for
several areas be a good idea maybe it's
Case by case situation but
maybe uh is it word thinking on the Z
issue
um I
now I know what you're saying the the
word thinking are they just trying to
use their own definition of the word and
that's definitely what's happening but
I think this is more a case of trying to
scapegoat people to boost your own
message so the the word thinking is just
two people having an argument but trying
to win by changing the definition of
words what's happening with the the the
Zion stuff is uh it's being used to
identify people that can be boosters of
your message
basically so similar but
different
all right
um so the other thing you need to know
about persuasion is although you can't
hypnotize one person to murder you can
very easily hypnotize a group of people
to see somebody as someone who is
deserving of murder and then you wait
and then you
wait so
um so look for
that you should you should look for
more evidence that they're looking for a
uh ex what would what would be the right
term for it something that's outside of
the political process would be would you
call that an extra political to mean
it's outside of the political process on
extrajudicial extrajudicial means you're
doing something illegal
right um yeah all right ladies and
gentlemen that is more than enough I
think we've done our job here um do you
believe in strategic
incompetence uh yes I mean all the all
the Lost documents and lost files I
don't believe any of that I I believe
that they are
strategically deleting things and
claiming
incompetence
yeah it's called
lying yep here's a question for you do
you think that Trump this time would be
able to assemble a highquality team or
will he be once again locked out from
you know the the strong traditional
players who normally would would want to
be part of an
Administration I I have a suspicion that
he might be able to get high quality
people I'm not positive it could work
the other way but part of the reason is
this uh the Republicans have a lot of
high quality people who could use
jobs yeah no I'm not one of them I'm
definitely not a high quality person in
terms of a government
job but um I don't even have to give you
names but just just
imagine all of the Republicans who would
make a good uh uh spokesperson for the
administration you they haded
Communications Ju Just just think of all
the insanely good choices that you can
make right just insanely good I I'm
going to throw one out for you okay a
head of Communications in a trump
Administration Greg
gelt yes or
no now I don't think he'd ever do it it
would be a it would be a suicide mission
but would Trump be smart enough to know
that if you made the um if you made
those stupid press events interesting
and you and you had somebody with a real
personality not somebody who's just
going to say no I don't know and I'll
look into that and you've asked a
question already you know all the all
the things what if you had
somebody who actually engaged with the
audience had fun with the audience the
audience may even like you know maybe
they just like him and he just has fun
with it because it's not a useful
process that the Press events are just
not useful and that's why didn't Trump
just get rid of them after a while he
just stopped them didn't he because
they're so but somebody like
you know let's say somebody of his
capabilities if you put somebody in who
can make a joke of stuff the joke gets
on TV right a boring answer maybe gets
on TV but you forget it anyway but a
real good funny answer becomes news so
Trump could actually create news by
making sure that his spokesperson was
funny and said things that you know were
supportive of the president but also you
couldn't
forget right now yeah I don't think I
don't think Greg's going to be the head
of communications but you could come up
with I'll bet you on your own you could
come up with 10 Republican names that
would be just fascinating in that job
just fascinating right uh
Tyrus Tyrus would be great I'm seeing
Tyrus being suggested as head of
Communications in a
republican uh he'd be
great he has the full the full u talent
stack so yeah I can get behind that I'd
watch it too I'd far more I far more
likely watch watch if Tyrus was giving
it because he's a big personality he's
funny you don't remember Tony Snow who
would mock stupid
questions yeah I don't
actually all
right that's all for now I'm going to go
do something else I'll get to talk a
little bit
to the good people in
locals and I'll say goodbye now to
YouTube thanks for joining
you're
awesome
