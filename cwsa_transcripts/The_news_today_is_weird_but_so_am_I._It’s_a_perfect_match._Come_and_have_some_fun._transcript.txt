good morning everybody
and welcome
to the finest moment of your entire life
it's called coffee with scott adams and
nothing's ever been better
and i think you'll agree
and all it will take is one simultaneous
sip
and all you need for that simultaneous
sip is a copper margarita glass of tiger
chalice design candy jugger flask
a vessel of any kind whoop correction
i'm getting a correction
not a vessel of any kind
uh there's one vessel that has been uh
disqualified
do not put your coffee in a russian tank
it might get reheated
but not in the way you're gonna like
so a vessel of any kind except a russian
tank it's called the simultaneous sip
it's the dopamine of the day it's gonna
happen now
go
yeah yeah that's good
uh i i saw a question or a clarification
here in the comments
um if a vessel of any kind for your
coffee is acceptable except the russian
tank
would a blood vessel
be acceptable a blood vessel
answer is
yes
you can call you can pour your coffee
directly into your blood vessels
and drink them that way
it takes out the middle band you know
your tongue your throat all that stuff
useless
all right well
just before i came on this live stream
i do a little uh pre-show on locals
subscript subscription platform
and i realize that i don't have the same
algorithm
on social media that you do
do you know that
so most of you
if not all of you
are
at the mercy of the algorithm
so the algorithm tells you what you're
going to see and that's what you see
most of you probably don't spend a ton
of time
going out and looking for things that
haven't been served up
is it fair to say
but
here's the thing
uh probably a full
60 percent
of all the content that i see and
interact with and therefore that's the
meaningful stuff to me
probably sixty percent of all of my
contact content
on twitter let's use that as an example
doesn't come from the algorithm
it's a special case
i'm a special case because all of you
my you know twitter followers etc you
send me things because you have an idea
that i would like it and so
the weird thing is
somebody says youtube's not working but
it's working fine i'm watching the
comments go by as you're talking
the famous people algorithm is that
people send you stuff
so in a weird way
somebody says the audio is awful but i
bet that's not the case let me let me
just check one thing
i'm just going to check youtube you're
fine stop complaining
um but i have a different algorithm than
the rest of you because human beings
decide what i'm going to see and then
they forward it to me and i'm far more
likely to see content as somebody who
follows me
sends to me directly because that that
means more prominent
so think about that
the people with blue checks
who talk about the news anyway
kind of a small group of people we're
not in the same algorithm as you are
isn't that weird
so now it looks like you youtube
probably is offline
because i think the comments went to
zero there might have been a time lag
there huh
i guess i'll just let it go
oh youtube shows waiting
uh you are directly searching rather
than using the algorithm well now
searching all i'm doing is looking at my
stream and people are sending me stuff
all right let's see if i can restart
youtube
