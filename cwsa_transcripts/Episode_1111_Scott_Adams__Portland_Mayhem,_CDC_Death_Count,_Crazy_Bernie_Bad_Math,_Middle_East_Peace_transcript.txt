[Music]
hey everybody
come on in come on in
you know it's going to be a tremendous
coffee with scott adams
possibly the kick off to an amazing day
we'll see about that a lot of that's on
you but i'll do what i can
and that's a lot which is to give you
the entertainment which is this
following hour
started by the simultaneous sip and all
you need is a copper mug or a glass of
tanker shells just diamond candy jugger
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
it's happening
right now go
[Music]
i would like to begin this wonderful
hour by reading you this little story
which i
just received from my
secret source deeply embedded
in rural america and it goes like this
somebody named miller 36 of tannersville
this is the area that i grew up in
upstate new york
was driving a ups truck on august 21st
when it struck two parked cars in the
city according to hudson police
but then apparently the truck continued
on
two police vehicles and a bicycle patrol
officer
responded to a 911 report and located
the truck at the corner of north blah
blah
following the accident now here's the
good part
hudson police officer randy stratman
jumped
onto the moving ups truck turned off the
ignition to stop the vehicle
and administered two doses of narcan
to miller the driver meaning that
the driver of the the ups truck
probably was suffering an overdose
probably
fentanyl and was asleep in the truck
while the truck was careening through
traffic
a police officer jumped on a moving
ups truck just like indiana and
frickin jones turns it off controls the
truck
and administers a life-saving narcan to
the driver
now here's what i'd like to suggest
i don't know if a social worker could
have pulled that off
you know what i mean you know this is a
this is the sort of stuff that's
literally happening
every single day all over america where
there are police officers running toward
trouble jumping on moving vehicles and
saving lives
every day don't hear about much about
this
but i give you that as your little array
of good news
want some more okay more good news
okay here it comes
saudi saudi arabia has apparently
given the green light for israel to uae
flights the civil kind not not a
military one of course
now it happened just a few times because
there were a few specific flights that
they exempted
one of them had jared kushner on it but
then apparently they talked about it and
moved that into a
more of a permanent situation but here's
the fun part
this is from uh ned yahoo so he was
talking about it and called it historic
uh big breakthrough you know you're
probably thinking to yourself
is that really a big breakthrough to be
able to fly over a country
that's it you just have permission to
fly
a commercial flight over somebody's
country
yeah turns out that's a pretty big deal
because in this case it shortens the
route to the point where
it makes tourism much less expensive
so it is so it actually has a specific
and immediate
economic stimulus component but that's
not the fun part
uh so netanyahu yahoo said and i quote
these are the fruits of peace he said
predicting that quote
more good news would be coming now
when you say more good news will be
coming and your
prime minister you don't say that unless
you know
more good news is coming meaning that
things are really starting to shape up
in the middle east
why is this not the biggest story in the
world
it's political season and it's something
that is
not just good from trump but one of the
best things ever
i think you could make the argument
already that trump is the best
president the united states has ever had
for
international relations now the counter
argument to that is
but wait what about those countries that
don't respect us as much anymore um
[Music]
i don't know is that costing me money
how do that affect me are they not
taking our phone calls
because i think they're taking our phone
calls are they not doing trade deals
with us
because they think origin man bad no
i haven't heard any reporting on that i
think
countries do whatever is in their best
interest in this case what's in the best
interest of the middle east
was working with the united states
productively
to get what looks like the beginning of
something that could be
lasting and good so uh
you know we're in a world where it's
hard to know what is true and
all of our information is bad but i feel
as though
historians are going to conclude that
trump was the best
president just in the first four years
it wouldn't even matter what happens
after this but just the first four years
i think
would be the most successful presidency
for international stuff for domestic
stuff
you could still make your arguments
here's something that only i would say
in public
[Laughter]
that's why you have me there are some
things that only i will say in public
you ready you know those are retail
businesses
that are being driven out of business by
the the riots
they were not good businesses and by
that i don't mean that they
all lost money although most of them
probably were
operating close to break even but they
were businesses that were going to go on
a business
maybe this year maybe next year maybe
five years
but amazon was going to polish off all
of those companies
any retail store yet the exceptions
would be maybe an
apple store but that's that's such an
exception
that most of these smaller retail
smaller restaurants
they were all going to go out of
business and here's the thing that
i don't think we've fully incorporated
into
our economic estimates a lot of the
small retail places especially the small
independent restaurants
are basically criminal organizations
this is why i'm the only one who'll say
this small businesses
like to do a thing i call not pay their
taxes
now uh or they you know they'll hire a
lot of illegal workers
restaurants especially so what
what happened that just demolished all
those downtown restaurants
probably was just an acceleration of
something that was going to happen
probably doesn't have nearly the
economic impact that you think it does
except unemployment and uh
and i think that cities probably we're
going to have less foot traffic anyway
because
all the other things happening the rich
people moving away
so i feel like the stock market is not
crazy to be so high lately
despite what looks like you know trouble
on the ground
because i think the stock market
realizes that you know if amazon and
apple are making money like crazy
but that little restaurant on the corner
went from
break even only by cheating on their
taxes
to non-existent
probably those people are going to find
work as something that's
maybe a better thing yeah the the
short-term disruption is
devastating so i don't want to minimize
the impact on the on the humans
who are involved with those businesses
it's extreme
and it's you know life ruining in many
cases but if you're looking at the
the larger economy it's a brutal economy
people go out of business all the time
it's just that it when it's distributed
across the country you don't notice
when it's concentrated on one main
street well then you notice
but it's not worse than sort of the
the baseline of companies going out of
business all over the place
as a normal part of capitalism um
so i don't want to act happy that
anybody's going out of business i'm just
saying it's
it's accelerating a trend that was going
to happen
another i think well
never mind um i'm noticing that
republicans are using a phrase i hadn't
seen as much of before
they're saying that the democrats have
made a devil's bargain
with the progressives a devil's bargain
watch how much satanic imagery
comes out of the biden kamala harris
campaign
again just sort of a fun coincidence
by the way i i tricked another a couple
of publications
into running a story about me believing
that satan
is behind the biden campaign
so every time they do a head piece on me
so there's another one this morning
a hip piece on me they don't quite know
what's going on
because first of all i don't know if
they know that they've changed the story
from me saying explicitly i don't
believe
that satan exists they've changed it all
the way to
i'm promoting satan being part of the
biden campaign
literally the opposite of what i said
but i did it intentionally i allowed
them to
take me out of context i created it so
that they could do it easily
not because they were fooled but because
they're bad people
and they would take it out of context
which they did
so so now when i see a hip piece like
that
that is falling into my trap i just
retweet it
you can't fault you can't fail harder
at a hit piece than to have the target
of your hit piece just retweet it
that's it just retweets it that's as
hard as you can fail
all right um 81
nobel prize winners endorsed joe biden
for president
in an open letter 81 nobel prize winners
wow smart capable people
the best of the best and 81 of them
all nobel prize winners and they all
think that
biden is is better but let's see what
are the reasons because
if you've got 81 nobel prize winners
and they offer their reasons these are
going to be good reasons
i mean these are not we're not talking
about a bunch of idiots
these are smart people the the best best
humanity has to offer
so when i read their reasons to you for
supporting by
biden i think you'll find them quite
quite
brilliant so sit down
uh because sometimes this level of
brilliance
can blind you momentarily so if you are
operating a motor vehicle just pull over
to the side of the road
because i'm gonna give you some
brilliance that honestly i was thinking
of wearing sunglasses just to read this
but i think we can get away with it just
you know playing it straight
all right the reasons that the 81 nobel
prize winners give is that
biden has a willingness to listen to
experts
okay that part's stupid because
literally every president listens to
experts
there's never been one that didn't
listen to experts there never will be
one that doesn't listen to experts
so the first part is kind of a throwaway
um that's obviously not the brilliant
part
because like i said these are 81
nobel prize winners so they're not going
to rest on
you know unwilling to listen to experts
when that's the stupidest thing you
could ever say in public
so it's the second part where the
brilliance comes out here goes
um and he has joe biden has a deep
appreciation for using science to find
solutions
okay let me look a little further in the
paragraph
because i'm looking for the smart part
because i know they wouldn't just say
he has a deeper appreciation for using
science
because again that would be literally
every living human being
would fall into this description trump
biden strangers people you've never met
people with severe brain damage people
in other countries
people have never been to school people
have been to school
people who have phds people who will
never have phds
pretty much a hundred percent of all
humanity
has a deep appreciation for using
science to find these solutions
so there must be something else in this
paragraph where they get to the smart
part
uh oh that's the end of the paragraph
huh huh
i i i guess what they're telling us is
that the
nobel prize is no longer prestigious
uh i i actually wanted to get a nobel
prize
until i read this and now i see that
there's not really any point to it
they've actually ruined the prestige
of the nobel prize now by the way i had
this same experience
when i was younger i always wished
because i'm
in sort of a writing business i wish
that i could win at a pulitzer prize
because imagine how cool that would be
right i mean just for the bragging
it's like yeah i don't like to brag
about it but
i did win a pulitzer prize you know i
always wanted to be able to
say that or have other people introduce
me
as pool and surprise winning cartoonist
scott adams
i thought that would be pretty pretty
cool
and i felt that until i met somebody who
told me how the pulitzer prize committee
works
it's just people who read books and pick
the one they liked
that's it it's just a small group of
people
who read some books that have been
submitted it's not all the books in the
world
just the people who filled out an
application and said i think my work is
so good it should be considered
and then a small group of people read
their stuff and say which one do you
like
i kind of like this one that's it
winning the pulitzer prize has no
prestige
nothing there's just there's just
nothing to recommend about that award
except somehow we got it in our heads
that it's important it isn't
it's just several people read some books
and they decided which one they liked
that's
it likewise when i won
the top award in cartooning it's called
the reuben it's like the
academy award for a cartoonist and one
year
and i'd you know lusted after it when i
was a new cartoonist i thought
if only someday i could win the top
award in cartooning
my life would be complete and one day i
won the top
two awards the top award for a cartoon
strip
but also the same year i won the top
award for all cartoonists of any kind
the number one in the entire world
and after i won it i realized oh
it's just because i had a good year
financially basically i made a lot of
noise
i was in the press the award committee
said you know what would be good
if we nominate somebody who's already
getting a lot of attention
and then we'll have more attendance at
our event
that was it it had nothing to do with
the quality of my work
and everything to do with the fact that
it was unusually commercially valuable
that year that was sort of a peak period
for
commercial success of dilbert i thought
okay well
that's off the list so now i have no
respect whatsoever for the top award in
cartooning
because i want it i took took all the
value out of it
i have no respect for the pool of
surprise because it's just some people
saying what book they like
that's it and now 81 nobel prize winners
just came out with the dumbest open
letter in all the world
and i just looked at it and said if
that's all it takes to be a nobel prize
winner is to be this dumb
i'm not sure i want one of those either
so
didn't expect that to happen here i made
a list
um to help you identify all the dumb
people
so you don't have to interact with them
so these
these are the complaints about trump
that if you see
any of these you can just stop listening
to whoever is talking or tweeting
all right if somebody says that trump
doesn't believe in science
just stop listening just walk away
nothing that somebody says after that
sentence
is worth listening to likewise doesn't
listen to experts basically the same
thing
don't listen to anything that anybody
says after they say that how about this
one
trump is unwilling to do his job
what unwilling to do his job
if you hear somebody say that just walk
away
you don't need to hear anything else
they say
after that moreover you should actively
try to forget
anything they said before that just in
case you inadvertently believe in any of
it
because somebody who is so dumb that
they would say and it doesn't matter if
you talk about trump or
any other human if you say they're
unwilling to do their job
once they're president because a lot of
people are watching
right they're doing their job trump
obama it doesn't matter who you're
talking about by the time you become
president
you're willing to do the job you didn't
get there by being lazy
or not caring how about this one he only
cares about himself
that's one that you can just say ah uh
i'm out
anybody who could say something that
monumentally is stupid
that he only cares about himself there's
no such thing
as a president whose personal fate
is disconnected from the fate of the
country
he is running or she is running you
can't disconnect those things
it's the most transparent job in the
entire world
there's no job more transparent we're
looking at
everything trump is doing everything we
see it all
and how in the world would anybody be in
that job and think you know
i think i'll do some stuff that's just
good for me
bad for the country good for me i don't
think anybody will notice
that's not a thing the president knows
with dead certainty i don't have to be a
mind reader
i just have to know that the president
has an iq over 20
because anybody with an iq over 20 i
might be exaggerating a little bit
knows that they have to do a good job
for the country
the entire world is watching every
minute of every day
we're all watching he doesn't have that
option of i think i'll just do something
that's good for me
that's not a thing even when the
president goes golfing
again i don't care if it's clinton or
obama or trump
do you want your leader to have some
time you know with his own head get
outdoors
to clear his mind maybe meet a few
people that he wouldn't have time to
talk to otherwise
yeah you should want that and you should
want him to do a copious amount
because it's good for him does he still
work hard enough
yes yes he works hard enough he works
really hard
it's obvious all right the other ones
that are crazy is he's a dictator
when a hundred percent of what we
observe violates that assumption
or that he's a racist when again
everything we observe shows that he
cares about
people who are citizens more than those
who are not
but beyond that that's it
that's it that's his whole preference
and he prefers people who obey the law
of course
but if you do those two things you're a
citizen
and you obey the law he likes you
and not just a little bit ask hershel
walker
does he like hershel walker yeah yeah
for years and years and years
now am i saying that because trump has a
black friend
no trump has a lot of black friends
people he's worked with people who have
given him awards
you know he has a very deep relationship
with a lot of different people
uh all right and here's here's my
favorite one
and i tweeted this if your main
criticism of your opponent
is chaos that that's what's wrong with
your opponent they're bringing chaos
you don't really have a complaint what
you have there is a perception problem
if you're saying somebody else is all
about the chaos
that's not really a statement about the
other person
that's sort of a public confession that
you don't
understand things well enough to get to
know what's going on
it's more about the limits of your own
ability to understand the world
and here's why chaos isn't something
that one person brings to the situation
chaos is the situation
the world is chaos all the time
if you knew what was going to happen
would you need the news why would there
be a news industry
if we already knew what was going to
happen the whole reason that we're
having this conversation
and a lot of you are finding out things
you know this morning in the news and
maybe
some of you hearing it from me for the
first time it's because you didn't know
it was going to happen
that's what the news is stuff you didn't
know was going to happen
for the most part and if you don't know
what's going to happen
it's chaos so just putting a
clever word on it and labeling it
doesn't change the fact that the world
is unpredicted
unpredictable all the time do you think
you could hire
or elect a president who would make the
chaos go away
i hope not because if the chaos goes
away we're all dead
the only way you could have no chaos is
to literally be dead
because the world serves up a lot of
chaos
you hope that you have a president who
knows how to deal with it
and one way not to deal with all the
chaos
is to really dig into all the details
i i have much less respect for the
presidents
who try to master all the details of the
topics i know that sounds
counterintuitive
you think well scott that's exactly what
you need isn't it don't you want the
president who really gets into the
the nuts and bolts really digs in a
little bit deeper
no no you want that kind of person who
has
like if somebody works in a cubicle you
want somebody who can
really dig into the details because
that's your job
if you work in a cubicle i'm not
disparaging people working in cubicles i
spent much of my career there i'm just
saying
that that's a different job some
people's job it is to get into the
details
other people are sitting on top of this
giant ball
of you know chaos let's call it
and they're trying to nudge the chaos
in intelligent ways whenever there's an
opportunity
and understanding all the details of all
the chaos
would be the least predictive productive
thing you could do
it's not what a leader does it's what
the cubicle does
the cubicle can dig in but they only dig
into their topic
the cubicle that's one cubicle over they
also dig in but only to their topic
because the level of complexity sue
would overwhelm anybody if you don't
chunk it down to its smallest part so
the last thing you want
is a leader who's obsessing over the
details
you just can't lead that way you you
know you wish that were possible
but that's wishful thinking instead
you have leaders who are dealing with do
i trust this person
does the general thrust of this fit with
my philosophy
is this something i could fix if i break
it
is this something that would cause maybe
a predictable
problem uh if i go this way versus that
it's a risk management situation a lot
of it is guessing a lot of its intuition
so anybody who is operating at the
child level that says that a candidate
is
bringing chaos when in fact chaos is
the canvas they're not really a
good observer
i've noticed this this correlation
anecdotally and i want to see if you can
notice it as i've
famously called out the democrats who
come out come after me on twitter
uh if they say completely irrational
things
and i check their profile they're
usually artists of some kind
and you can tell they're an artist
because their comments
depart from rational thought so so
grotesquely but there's another category
because not all democrats and not all
critics of the trump are are artists
some of them have jobs where they've
learned critical thinking
what do the people who have actually
learned critical thinking
let's say your economist your lawyers
your your business people
there are lots of other jobs but ones
who actually have
skill and experience and critical
thinking and risk management
what did they say when they come after
me
i will give you an example sure dilbert
or well that's from the cartoonist
that's it they give the they just do
sarcasm
as if that says everything that needs to
be said well there's the cartoonist
nothing else needs to be said and
i want you to see if you find that
correlation so check
profiles when somebody comes at you with
nothing but sarcasm
and see if this pattern holds i don't
know if it will but it might
just see if the critical thinkers use
sarcasm
and the artist try to use logic
but it's not working for them all right
there's a i guess rand paul has called
for uh
the subpoena of antifa's plane records
and hotel records and travel and stuff
to find out who's funding antifa
and i think that's everything
you know it feels to me it's too early
to know
but it feels to me that if we find out
who's
funding at least the primary agitators
that you know get everybody else going
it only takes a small number of people
to get the rest of the crowd you know
going in some direction
so just for clarification nobody
believes
that all of antifa are being paid to be
there
there are no there are no conservatives
who believe that
no republicans nobody on twitter
nobody's ever suggested
that all the blm or all of the antifa
or even most are being paid to be there
clearly not the case the the assertion
is
the allegation if you will that there is
a high likelihood based on
evidence a high likelihood that some
number of them some kernel of them
small colonel are paid professional
agitators
and it would be good to know who's
paying them because they might be the
ones who are driving the animal spirits
of the rest
so rand paul continues to be one of the
most productive members of congress
seemingly being the only person who's
willing to do useful things on a regular
basis
i don't know what to say about this like
how many times
have i told you there was a good thing
happening
and then the name attached to it was
rand paul
it's a fairly common event and and i say
to myself
aren't there a lot of other people in
congress like why is it all the smart
stuff comes from just a handful of
people
it's pretty consistent so
nancy pelosi's got some political
trouble
she was caught on security camera
indoors getting her hair blown out some
kind of
a wash and a blow for her hair now i
guess the shop was closed
to other people but she was in the shop
and she had her
mask off and so she got a lot of
pushback from that i guess her
response was that she didn't know it was
wrong
now here's my opinion about that
don't care at all i don't care even a
little bit
that nancy pelosi was indoors
when other people are not allowed
indoors you know because it's against
the rules
and i don't mind that she didn't have
her mask off when she was getting this
particular treatment
um by the way a lot of personal services
such as massages
it's not that uncommon for the the
provider to have a mask
as in nancy's case but the person
receiving the service
to not have a mask depending on what the
services
for example but in most cases when you
could wear a mask
it's recommended now
i i and the reason the reason i'm not
going to climb all over
pelosi for what is being called the
massive hypocrisy
is not because it isn't it is it's
massive hypocrisy
but it's also not important and
i would like to establish the belief
that the leaders of our country should
not be
treated like the rest of us
i don't think that's wrong i believe
that nancy pelosi
should be able to get her hair done
indoors
because she's the speaker of the house
and
you know there are things that you can't
do
on the sidewalk if you're the speaker of
the house
now if everybody else was on the
sidewalk they're anonymous
people walk by that's fine it's safe
it's good enough but if you're the
president of the united states
or you're the you know you're the
speaker of the house or your rand paul
yeah that's okay with me if they take
you alone because being indoors the
problem is not just indoors
the problem is indoors with lots of
people if you take nancy
indoors with one person who's wearing a
mask
and let's say that nancy has been tested
she probably has been recently
it's not the biggest risk in the world
and she is safer
indoors than she would be outdoors
you know i i get that other people say
hey
other people we did our own hair we
worked it out but she's also in her 80s
i don't know can she do her own hair
being in her 80s is a bigger problem to
me than the fact she got her hair blown
out
so i would like to be consistent because
there's no way in the world there
won't be you know republicans and other
people
who get caught without masks etc you
know maybe it'll happen to me
you know maybe i'll get caught on some
video without a mask or something
and it's just i can't get i can't get
interested in it
all right but i understand it's a fun
story in a political season
um chicago police released
surveillance video of suspects looting
the store and they're asking for help
identifying them now the people that
they're
showing are don't have masks on
some do but most of them don't now
what do you tell yourself when you see
that
chicago is asking the public to help
them identify the pictures that they're
publishing
presumably online i don't know if it's
in any newspapers too
what does that tell you think
think through what do you know is true
if chicago is printing photos of people
and saying public
can you identify them
here's what you know is true chicago
are really really incompetent do you
know
how hard it would be to identify every
person in that photo
here's how hard it would be all right
i'm going to demonstrate this
this will be the entire effort to
identify
every single one within
two seconds so the entire time to
identify every picture
my claim is sub two seconds and it looks
let me demonstrate it looks like this
let's say this is the picture
now this is my phone and i look at the
picture
and i push this button and then their
face comes up and i've identified them
you can do that with an app it's an app
that law enforcement uses
routinely in other places what this
tells me
is that chicago for whatever reason
is the only place that's not buying an
easily
purchasable app that every law
enforcement person knows about
knows how to get knows how to use
literally it's this easy
point your phone at the picture you
don't even have to paint point it at the
person
point it at a photo press one button
done the name of the person appears on
your phone
almost every time close to 100
now what's wrong with chicago
that they can't buy this little app well
obviously
there's somebody who told them that
you're here i'm speculating a little bit
so i feel like i'm speculating
responsibly but it's speculation so i
don't wanna
i don't wanna sell this as fact they
have to not be using these apps
clearview is the the leader in that
field they're obviously not using clear
view
why not why not
what is the difference between using
that app and getting their answer in two
seconds
versus publishing these in public and
asking the public to identify them which
probably will work
it's just really really hard
it's crazy yeah facial recognition would
have them in two seconds
and when i say two seconds that's not an
exaggeration
the app doesn't even have to sit there
and process it's
actually two seconds now
and some of the apps are better than
others at recognizing african american
faces
i think clear views might be the leader
in getting that right
but of course you still have to verify
you don't want to you don't want to
trust the
app for the final final uh
identification but it tells you where to
look
all right uh
there's a report that the number of
people looking for divorces was
34 higher from march through june
ouch and the data shows that 31
of the couple's admitted lockdown has
caused irreparable
damage to their relationships 31
of couples believe they have irreparable
damage to their relationship
irreparable this is gonna
tear apart the you know the nature of uh
society now i always had a theory
that part of a successful relationship
is distance
in other words the fact that uh let's
say one of the
adults goes off and works all day uh
or maybe both of the adults go off and
work all day
it's probably a really healthy thing
because if you're in each other's
business all the time
that can cause some tension and
it looks like we've proven that i've
said before that
the the nuclear family needs to be
not eliminated that's black lives
matters ideas
sort of get rid of the nuclear family i
think if i have that right i hope i have
that right
i've said something compatible with that
but different which is
that you shouldn't be the only model
because so many people won't be able to
achieve it
not everybody can have a nuclear family
sometimes it requires a certain amount
of money
sometimes you got to be lucky you know
to get the right person
there's a lot that can go wrong with the
nuclear family but if it works for you
i would agree that for those families
where it works
it's tremendous it'd be hard to beat as
a organizing
principle but we do need something for
the people who can't make that work
um and i think that shows it joy reid
uh i don't think she'll get cancelled
because she's on the side that doesn't
try to cancel itself as much as he
cancels other people
but she's being accused of being
islamophobic i guess
uh who who accused her of that oh uh
elon omar
representative omar actually said she
said
of joy reid honestly this kind of
casual islamophobia is hurtful and
dangerous
we deserve better need an apology etc so
what is it that joy reid said that would
cause her own side
to try to cancel her how bad was it
well let me read it she said leaders
let's say in the muslim world
talk talk a lot of violent talk and
encourage their
supporters to be willing to commit
violence including on their own bodies
in order to win against whoever they
decide as the enemy
and she said other things
so she got in trouble for comparing
muslims
to republicans i think because the next
part of this was
she was saying about uh radicalizing
supporters
so so joy reid might get cancelled
or at least she's getting in trouble for
comparing
muslims to republicans
is could that be any better is there
anything more entertaining
than watching joy read get cancelled by
elon omar
for comparing muslims to republicans
that's just
everything the the whole
the whole year 2020 was just put into
that one little package
if you only needed to know that one
thing you'd know how the rest of the
year went
all right here's my problem with
intersectionality and critical race
theory
two categories of things which i am no
expert on
but i'll just ask this question
isn't the guaranteed end result of those
things
that we keep carving each other into
smaller and smaller categories
until everybody has a reason to hate
everybody
how else can it go because i would love
to hear the thinking
that says how this brings us to a better
place
it certainly brings us to um it's
certainly good
to talk about you know racism and sexism
and all those things
and try to deal with them as practically
as we can
but if the moment you've dealt with it
you said okay okay we're doing
the best we can to let's say make
the world just as good for black people
and white people
of course we're not there but let's say
we're doing a good job on that the next
thing that happens is
well what about black people who are
also muslims and then you say all right
all right that's a new category
it feels like every time you slice the
category
well what about if you're black
a muslim and gay
okay okay we better do something about
that category i don't see how
you ever take this philosophy to a good
end point it feels like it's a it's one
direction to complete destruction
and i don't i can't even conceive
of the exit path i don't see the exit
path where
where things get better and better and
then you reach a good place i
i'd love to have somebody explain to me
the thinking behind that because i think
like most left versus right differences
it doesn't take into account human
motivation
it doesn't take into account human
psychology
or the way an average person thinks or
acts
this is the thing that the conservatives
consistently get right
and the left consistently gets wrong
which is forgetting that humans
will always act like humans if you
design a system that can't work
for humans don't be surprised if it
doesn't work
i mean why would that be surprising
all right bernie sanders said one of the
dumber things you'll ever hear
he said this the mainstream media
doesn't talk about it
space space space congress doesn't talk
about it
space space space trump doesn't talk
about it
space space space but three
multi-billionaires now own more wealth
than the bottom half of our society
and he goes he suggests that that would
be
very very bad now
here's what's wrong with that now i've
i've described myself as being left to
bernie
but with this special uh caveat
that i'm also good at math i use good at
math
as a proxy for a good thinking
and good at logic and i'm not like the
world's best at any of those things
i'm just better than bernie so i can see
the obvious
idiocy that he brings to the table and
here's the problem
suppose nobody knew how much money those
billionaires had
it's just here's a mental experiment all
right
so bernie has said it's a real problem
that three billionaires have as much as
the bottom half of the entire
united states that's an amazing
statistic
it's like it's you know mind-numbingly
jaw-droppingly
amazing but imagine a world
where you just didn't know they existed
exactly like they exist now the only
difference is
you didn't know how much money they had
would you be worse off it doesn't make
any sense
if the only reason we're complaining
about it is that we know about it
but there's nothing underlying in terms
of it won't hurt you if you didn't know
about it
why is this his biggest problem why is
he raising this
in a time of you know great uncertainty
in this world and
you know problems that are as big as any
problems we've ever had
why is he raising the only problem i
could think of where if you literally
didn't know it existed
you would never find out because nothing
would go wrong
in fact you'd be hearing bill gates
is you know giving away hundreds of
millions of dollars and
curing malaria or polio or some damn
thing in africa
and you'd hear that story and you say
huh i wonder how he's paying for it
but would you be unhappy that bill gates
was
you know curing a disease in africa no
no you'd be kind of happy about it you
just wouldn't know how he paid for it
would you be unhappy if you found that
elon musk had figured out not only a way
to go to mars
but he had created an entire competitive
space industry
which makes the future of the earth
possibly far better
than it would have been without our
ability to someday you know
effectively leave our gravity force
gravitational force
what would you think about that if you
didn't know that
that elon musk was worth billions and
all you knew
is that he was a guy who opened up space
he was a guy who built a network of
solar
shingles for your house that could work
into your
your battery which someday might be part
of a solution
for green energy that would make the
world a better place
suppose you didn't know he was a
billionaire but you knew he did all of
those things
would you be less happy what exactly
is sanders talking about other than
jealousy
does sanders understand that the money
that the billionaires own
is being used you know jeff
bezos ownership of amazon is still
mostly in the stock
that's why he's so rich it's in the
stock if if bezos
pulled his money out of the stock
what would he do with it would he buy
more food for himself
no he probably eats all the food he
needs
to stay fed there's a limit to how many
things a rich guy can buy
you know bezos got his got his yacht
which he probably hardly ever uses and
he'll be tired of it and then he'll get
rid of it but he got one
billionaires don't really have a way to
consume the wealth they have they have
to put it into
something that benefits the economy they
have to
they don't really have an option so he
has to put it in stock where it's
bolstering you know the market in
different ways or you put it in the bank
and then the bank can
you know use that for lending but money
doesn't just sit in the mattress
these billionaires aren't sitting on a
gigantic pile of
dollar bills it's in their money is in
the system working
they're the ones who are funding
startups
you know where where do all of your uh
you know important startups come from
they come from some billionaire who who
said well
i can put a million dollars into this
startup it might work it might not but i
got an extra million i don't care
so for bernie not to understand the most
basic basic basic stuff
about economics is really embarrassing
all right uh and
uh bernie goes on to say that that level
of inequality is immoral and
unsustainable but again
if you didn't know they had the money it
wouldn't make any difference at all
it would be completely sustainable if
you just didn't know about it
that's it now i could argue that maybe
warren buffett
is not adding as much to the world
because he's more of a financial
manipulator
but even he is making markets and
companies more efficient
because when he buys a piece of a
company he doesn't just buy it
often he'll you know improve it
in small ways and big the the people who
are worthless are the hedge fund
types who are just making just you know
taking money out of the system but
they're not adding anything
all right it seems to me that biden's
value proposition
has devolved into some form of
vote for biden or biden's followers will
hunt you down
and kill you now that's hyperbole
but it's starting to feel that way isn't
it because the way you feel isn't
necessarily the
exact way that things are but the way it
feels
as a trump supporter is that biden is
literally threatening us
that if you know and other people have
made this observation but i'm just
piling on it does feel like the left is
threatening us but here's what they
don't get
the left has not yet fully internalized
that the protesters are not on their
side
you get that right the left doesn't
quite understand they're just starting
to understand that's why they're coming
out against them
that the the protesters are not on their
side
the protesters are on their own side
whatever that is
but they're definitely not on the
democrat side and they're not on trump's
side
they're not on america's side you could
argue
there's a big non-story two big
non-stories in the
um conservative world now for those of
you who say
scott why do you only say good things
about trump
why don't you never say any bad things
about
the other side well i do all the time
and i'm gonna do that now so there's
this
tape you heard it on uh tucker's show
some of you
chris cuomo talking to of all people
michael cohen
the disgraced and jailed lawyer
ex-lawyer for
trump so apparently chris cuomo and
cohen knew each other pretty well who
knew that that's
sort of a weird little backstory but
on this uh on this audio recording
chris cuomo is heard to say things which
are
completely exculpatory and
make chris cuomo look like he did not do
the things he's accused of how did
conservative pundits treat
an audio tape in which it's pretty clear
that chris cuomo legitimately believes
he was not involved
in the things that he was accused of
doing the the metoo-ish
accusations how does conservative world
treat the fact
that it really shows he doesn't think he
did these things in private
he acts like he he believes that they
didn't happen
they treat it like it happened like like
he didn't say
what he said and i watch this and i
think
we're seeing more and more of this where
somebody will say they'll hand you
an apple and they'll say what do you
think of this banana
and you'll say what banana you just
handed me an apple this is clearly an
apple
it's red it's round i take a bite out of
it it's an apple
stop saying this is a banana because
that's an apple
and then the person will look right at
you like nothing had ever happened and
they'll say
is the banana good and you'll say
what's going on here this is no banana
we're both looking at this it's an apple
and the other person will look right at
it and say now that's a banana
i don't i've never seen this before so
it happened with the cuomo story there's
there's nothing on there that should be
embarrassing to chris cuomo
and is treated as a national story of
something that's embarrassing to chris
cuomo
it's literally the opposite it's
completely exculpatory
i don't even know what to think about
that all right is that the only time
that's happened
no how about this one
so dr scott alice he's part of the
trump uh team you know the coronavirus
team i guess and cnn was reporting that
he was pushing
for herd immunity so he came on
i think it was fox and they said uh were
you doing that
he was like no no i've never pushed for
herd immunity
nobody has it's not even a thing it's
never been brought up the president's
never mentioned it
it's never been in a conversation it's
never been floated as a possibility
nobody thinks it's something we should
pursue there's
zero times zero times zero to this story
what will people say once the the person
who
is the most closest to the story
what will cnn say now that he has said
no there's nothing to it they'll just
act like he didn't say it
and they'll just keep reporting that
it's happening
like it didn't even happen this is
just a weird world how about uh there's
another one how about
the the story that the cdc had
uh modified their death count and it
wasn't 180 000
or whatever it was closer to 9 000
because
there were only six percent of the
people were dying without comorbidities
therefore
it's all it's all the big fraud etc
nothing like that happened it again
it's like a big national story but it
didn't happen
it literally didn't happen none of that
happened
all that happened is they just sliced it
a different way
and as the experts say um pretty much
everybody who dies of anything has
comorbidities
it's very rare for a person to die
unless it's you know say an accident or
some rare genetic disease or something
but it's actually really unusual for
anybody to die without comorbidities
so the fact that 94 of people
who die from coronavirus have
comorbidities
it's kind of like everything else now
what do
conservatives say but they say but but
scott
i know what you're saying but still what
that proves
scott you're missing the whole point
scott scotty
people who disagree with me like to call
me scotty scotty you're missing the
whole
point the point is that those people who
don't have the comorbidities
should not have been afraid because
their their odds of dying are just
vanishingly small so let's send the kids
back to school
because why in the world would you not
send kids to school when a
you know it's good for the kids you know
that their risk
is tiny there's no reason there's no
logic
whatsoever for not sending the kids to
school
and i look at that and i go what's wrong
with you
what's wrong with you that you would say
that in public
the reason that they don't want to send
the kids to school is not that the kids
will die
it's that they'll be part of the
transmission that will get to the
94 percent of people with comorbidities
and there's more spread could could put
the teachers at risk in some cases we
don't know how much risk but could put
him at risk
well it would put him at risk we don't
know how much
and i think to myself if you leave out
the part
where the kids bring it home or or help
spread it
you're not part of the you you can't
consider your part
self part of the adult conversation
right the the
minimum minimum requirement to be an
adult in the conversation
is you have to at least acknowledge the
big factors in the
in the conversation one big factor is
the kids themselves
and i think almost everybody agrees that
they would be mostly fine
and the risk would be so small that the
benefits to the kids themselves
would be tremendous benefit to the
parents
tremendous because the parents would now
be freed up
to you know do what they need to do but
if you leave
out the part about this clearly would
contribute to the spread
if you leave that part out you're not in
the adult conversation
you really aren't
now you could argue that it won't spread
it but that would be a scientific
question
i think the evidence is that it probably
does but maybe we don't know
but still if you leave it out you're not
part of the adult conversation
uh the funniest story is the uh
portland's mayor
has just reportedly i would look for
confirmation on this
but reportedly he's considered
considering selling his home in portland
because the protests so the guy who has
been most supportive of the protesters
and literally joined in with him is
learning that these protesters are not
on his side
as he had hoped but rather are a
maligned
force as they like to say on tv
here's another non-story reported as a
big story
the state department i guess in kiev
something about
ukrainians you know the state department
our our state department
was illegally monitoring conservatives
on twitter
and social media jack possabic hannity
laura ingram and others to which i say
why is that a story do you know who else
is illegally monitoring
jack posabic i am
i am yeah i'm illegally uh reading his
twitter account and when he tweets
i i break the law i break the law and i
read it
and if he tweets again i don't like to
broadcast this but
i'm probably going to break the law
again and read what he tweeted
now you might say that you say to me
scott that's not what they're talking
about they're not talking about
reading his tweets what are they talking
about
do are they talking about hacking
twitter
no that's not in the story that all
they're talking about
is asking some third party to keep an
eye on various accounts that were of
importance
and tell them what they saw so that they
didn't have to do it themselves
is that is that a real story
now if there's more to it if there was
some hacking an actual
illegal act i would say yeah let's look
at that
but the way it's reported and again
could be more to the story i don't know
but the way it's reported is they asked
somebody to read
the tweets of people who are important
to their
livelihoods and their jobs and i thought
to myself
i don't think that's illegal
if it is it shouldn't be trump is
fighting against
fighting back against the so-called fake
news that he had some kind of stroke or
mini strokes or something
the the best evidence against it is that
he uh
his trip to walter reed was brief and he
went home
if you had if you had any of the things
that he was alleged to have had
do you go in and then just go home and
go back to your job the next day
is that a thing well so i think this is
debunked the president has debunked it
in the
the clearest possible words but i know
that
you know the public isn't going to trust
him on that
if i had to guess
i would guess his slurred speech and a
few of his
speeches could be fatigue it could be
dental work
could be anything but
my guess is that whatever they rushed
him in for was
something embarrassing or something that
wasn't really a problem
and if it wasn't really a problem did
you need to do anything
have any of you ever gone to the
emergency room
only to be told oh that's no big deal
you have right you know unless you're
bleeding or you've got a broken arm or
something
how many of you have gone in and the
emergency room just says
oh that's that's nothing take an aspirin
it's a pretty common thing so i wouldn't
be surprised if
they did rush the president in for you
know
some greater medical treatment than uh
than they had available in the white
house and i guess there's a lot in the
white house
and then they checked it out and it was
no big deal or something
easily treatable and he just wants it
out of the news
which i can understand
what was biden's exact quote when he did
his speech and he said
do i look like some kind of wild-eyed
progressive what were his exact words
do i look like some kind of wild-eyed
progressive
and i thought to myself how does that
get him the vote of the wild eyed
progressives
because it feels like he's insulting how
they look
isn't it because he's saying do i look
do i look like like literally look he
didn't say
have i acted like do i have a record of
you know have i have i ever promised
anything in that nature
he didn't say that he said look at me
like literally with your eyes look at me
do i look like some wild-eyed
progressive
it feels like he was mocking the
protesters
their actual physical look not that we
haven't done that
but it would be news if he did and i
wondered how this
completely escaped the uh
the pouncing i thought there'd be more
pouncing on that
all right um apparently trump is down
depending on what
polls you want to believe they're all
over the place but
uh i think it was an a silver who said
trump is down four to five percent or
he said if it was more of an if
it's based on where things are heading
nay silver
said that if trump ends up being down
four to five percent of the battleground
states
it's actually a close race
here's what i say what does it mean to
be down four or five percent
in a world where 12 percent of the gop
says that they won't tell pollsters
their honest opinion
so 12 percent of republicans would lie
and trump's only down 4 to 5
what does that tell you now i want you
to correct
me on the math of this but sometimes
there are things that seem
really obvious that are
your brain isn't quite processed in the
right so this might be one of those
but here's what people are missing if a
republican voter simply
refuses to talk to a pollster they'll
just call until they get another
republican
so refusing to answer probably doesn't
change the result that much
because they'll just find somebody who's
willing to answer until they have enough
answers but if the gop
people who are being surveyed are lying
it's a double impact because not only
are they
are they taking a vote away from trump
that they intend to cast
but they're giving it to biden doesn't
that double the impact
because it's not just a vote that's
missing it's a vote that the lie
puts on the wrong tally so it's a so
so that one person makes a difference of
two
one away from trump and one for biden
am i thinking of that right i feel like
i'm confusing myself but that's right
right
so this is a good example of why
i'm never embarrassed to be stupid in
public it's a good skill you should
learn it
because sometimes i'll hit on something
that's useful and other times i'll say
something that's like
uh okay so people in the comments are
agreeing with me
but so therefore that four or five
percent
is really nothing because if 12
are lying that's a gigantic swing
if their lie is that they're voting for
biden and they're not
all right um
uh yeah i guess that's all i got for
today
and um
it's like losing a stroke in golf
is it no it's not like losing a stroke
in golf
because that doesn't add a stroke to the
person you're golfing against
uh
all right yes it's a double dipper
okay um that's all i've got for now
and i will talk to you tomorrow
