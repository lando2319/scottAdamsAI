good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization
it's called a coffee with Scott Adams
and uh you're very lucky to be here
especially if you're seeing it live
and if you'd like to take your
experience up to the orgasmic levels of
euphoria that you know you deserve all
you need is a cup or a mug or a glass a
tanker jealous of Stein a canteen
children flask a vessel
you also need my microphone to put on
yes yes yes
thank you for the assist
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dope immediate of the
day the thing that makes everything
better is called the simultaneous sip
that happens now cow
ah
much better
well I just saw a tweet from Elon Musk
who says a friend of his who lives in
San Francisco
I had a bullet go through his wall of
his apartment yesterday
but that's not the interesting part
the interesting part is it's the second
time
imagine living in San Francisco and on
two occasions two separate occasions a
bullet goes ripping through your
apartment
now I have what I call the three bullet
rule
if I'm living someplace the first two
times a bullet goes ripping through my
walls
I'm okay but that third time I'm
starting to see a pattern
by the third time I'm like huh
I'm going to start to evaluate my
options
now I remind you of my experience in San
Francisco in the uh let's see it was the
80s
San Francisco in the 80s
say my apartment was completely cleaned
out once
so I got robbed while I was at work
my car was broken into and my stereo was
stolen four times I think
um
let's see uh I was mugged once by a
giant knife
uh once by uh Gone on the street
twice when I was a bank teller people
pulled guns on me one time I was walking
down the street and somebody put a gun
at my head and pulled the trigger but
there was no uh there was no round in
the chamber
he thought that was pretty funny
um so that was my experience
it wasn't unusual to come walking home
and see you know somebody being beaten
to death in the sidewalk
it was sort of a normal experience where
I lived
so I'm not so sure that San Francisco is
worse than the 80s but it's definitely
worsening
um Conor McGregor attended the Miami
Heat game and I guess they were going to
do a little promotional thing where he
would come out and he would humorously
get in a fight with him
with the Miami Heat mascot
in which he would punch the mascot and
that would be you know part of the part
of the show
so he punches the mascot and the mascot
goes down as you'd expect and then he
gets on top of the muskin mascot and he
and he gives it a kill shot
well anyway the mascot went to the
hospital
ah and I'm wondering I'm wondering how
that job was described to the mascot
you know was there a meeting beforehand
in which the mascot probably has a boss
right there's a boss of the mascots and
the boss was like Hey we've got the best
idea you're gonna love this and the
mascot says great great what is it what
is it it goes you're going to share the
stage with Conor McGregor
of the mascots like really really the
like most famous MMA fighter of all time
Conor McGregor yes that's great that's
great
well there's one more thing really what
is it
well Conor McGregor is going to punch
you
oh
what
yeah Conor McGregor is going to punch
you
well I thought you I thought you said
Conor McGregor is going to punch me yeah
he's gonna punch you really hard it'll
be hilarious watch this
but uh but he's gonna hold his punch
right
he's not going to give me like a full
force MMA punch right
oh no no it's probably going to be
three-quarter speed tops
and besides your mascot head will be
protecting you won't it
Well turns out that mascot head's a
little softer than you'd expect and uh a
75 punch from a MMA fighter is kind of
hurts kind of hurts so he's in the
hospital anyway it's not funny that
somebody got hurt but I like management
I like bad management stories so to me
this just sounds like a bad management
story like they could have worked out a
few more details before sending them out
to get punched by the the strongest
puncher in the world
[Laughter]
I'm sorry I shouldn't be laughing at
that
I feel terrible about myself I really do
but
um you might know that I treat my
mascots the same way
so got that in common
all right uh so now I've heard Alan
dershowitz take on the Trump legal risk
from all of his boxes of Secrets
and dershowitz basically says there's no
risk
and then I read Jonathan Turley and he's
got a slightly different take on it but
for different reasons
no risk there's just no risk all right
here's what dershowitz says basically
most of the charges look like they can
be easily defended against
in other words the defense against most
of what he did with the records
including not giving him back I guess
doesn't doesn't rise the level of Crim
of a a criminal case
but might be a civil case of some kind
and should have been handled that way or
some other kind of crime so it wouldn't
be the kind of thing that would keep him
out of office or put him in jail
so there's most of the charges are in
that easy to dismiss or easy to defend
uh concept because of some I don't know
some records act that defines this area
pretty well so that's what dershowitz
says he says there's one thing you have
to worry about though there's one one
part that might put him in jeopardy
and that's the audio that they have that
alleges that he had a document that he
even described as something that
shouldn't be shown to people that maybe
he showed to somebody
maybe he showed to somebody which would
be pretty bad if it were you know a
really super secret document which he
said it was he said it was still a
secret
and now this is the funny part in
dershowitz in the in the process of
simply talking about the case
he offered up the Perfect Defense
for the only part of the case that he
thought was risky which is the audio
here's the Perfect Defense which do you
think is more likely now this depends on
the writer's testimony as well right so
you'd have to hear what the writer says
about it but which of these two things
do you think is more Trump I'm going to
give you a uh an example
I'll be Trump now oh man I got these
secret documents here got these secret
documents
um why don't you read them here here you
go once you read them well I say
silently
all right
okay you got it did you read those
all right so that's that's one thing
that could have happened and that would
be really bad wouldn't you agree if he
handed it to the writer and says take a
look at this read this
that would be very bad
does that sound like Trump
is is your imagination of who Trump is
they would hand somebody a document when
he's the star of the meeting right the
meeting is about him
but he's going to give you a document
and maybe sit there silently while you
read it
that sounds just like him doesn't it
all right let me give you another
possibility that might have happened
this might be closer to it
wow I got these secret things that I can
see because I'm a president you can't
whoa well you imagine if you saw these
if I showed you these well let me just
describe what's here there's some bad
things in here but wow wow you can't see
it this is some secret stuff whoa whoa
whoa I was President so I could see it
well I'm not president now so maybe you
know but uh yeah I didn't really do that
which one sounds more like Trump
it's not even close
I don't think there's I don't think
there's a chance in the world
they handed it to him and he waited
while he read it
do you I mean seriously
now like I said if the writer who was in
the room and I guess it was one other
gentleman in the room if they said
that's what happened then probably
that's what happened
but it's really hard to believe
and if it turns out that all he did was
you know flash it and talk about you
know overall the topic
probably not a big deal
so the dershowitz take is that it's all
easy to defend
and that that's the most dangerous part
and we don't know all the details but if
it sounds the way it sounds on audio in
other words if the story is just what
you hear on the audio
there's no real risk
so that's the dershowitz take
the Jonathan Turley take I think is
cleaner and also to the same point but
his take is there's no way you could
complete this trial before the election
you know because everything takes years
so if they don't complete it before the
election Trump can pardon himself now
that's totally's View now maybe the
Supreme Court would disagree
but it wouldn't stop him from doing it
would it I mean maybe it would go to the
Supreme Court but I think they might
agree
my take is that the Supreme Court is not
going to say there is something in the
Constitution that forbids the president
from pardoning themselves
because if if the Constitution wanted
that in there probably be there if it's
not there it's not there that should be
the end of the story you know I'm no
constitutional
scholar
but if it's not in there it would be
hard to imagine it was assumed to be
there like why would you assume that
under on what basis could he make the
assumption that they meant it to be
there I I see no argument for it
whatsoever
all right so
it appears to me that the Democrats are
trying to uh win the next election
via a process of proving that everything
Trump said about them is true
and that it really is a Witch Hunt by
the way dershowitz says
fairly directly yeah this this is a
political Act
would you feel comfortable if you were
the Democrats and and somebody who is a
lifelong Democrat
dershowitz and also you know leading
scholar of this exact kind of stuff
tells you it's obviously political
there's no doubt about it there's not
even a gray area this is obviously
political
to me this is absolutely confirming
everything that Trump said about
uh people going after him and they would
go after you next because they're going
after supporters too
so Trump is gaining energy he is
flipping uh people who were
let's say in the past they were
anti-trump or at least didn't care
and they've radicalized people to care a
lot about defending Trump they've also
taken everybody else out of the news do
you remember that big DeSantis news
I don't
wasn't ready I don't know you know a few
people got into the race but the only
thing you heard about them as they got
into the race
do you remember what Chris Christie's
policies are
no you don't nobody knows I mean some
Republican stuff I guess how about that
Mike Pence
who
who
just took him right out of the news
so I don't
I don't know what the Democrats are
thinking
are they thinking this is a good play
because on day one it looked like it was
I have to admit on day one when I heard
all the charges and the 37 charges and
the the pictures of the boxes in the
bathroom at Mar-A-Lago and I thought to
myself oh that's worse than I thought
all this time I thought it was going to
be no big deal but it's oh it's so much
worse
and it took exactly what 48 hours
for you know let's say dershowitz and
Turley to weigh in two people that I
trust on this stuff
yeah to basically say nah it's another
one of those walls are closing and not
much to look at here now it'll be
interesting and you know the process has
to play through but I don't think
there's a risk it looks like they just
found the only way that you could
guarantee Trump would get elected
now some would say
that's their plan Scott their entire
plan is to look incompetent and look
like liars
until
Republicans
nominate Trump and then they can beat
him easily because he's so beatable in
the general I like him
let me ask you this if Trump quit today
which will never happen
and DeSantis became the you know
presumptive nominee
how long would it take for DeSantis to
be accused of something equally bad
different but just equally bad
about yeah about a minute
yeah he DeSantis would immediately
become the
anti-lgbtq Hitler right or or Mussolini
because they like to keep it nice and
racist that's how the Democrats like it
nice and racist call him moose lady
because he's Italian
so
all right well keep an eye on that but
it sure looks like they're trying to get
Trump elected
all right George Soros has retired I
guess you could call it that and handed
over control of his charitable stuff to
his uh 37 year old son I guess he's got
two sons and it was not obvious that the
the younger one would take over now you
say to yourself well Scott that makes no
difference whatsoever because the sun is
radicalized by the father
and uh the the sun will just take on you
know carry on and maybe the sun was in
charge for a long time anyway
maybe there's no difference at all
and maybe you're totally right
however I would like to inject this
little note of optimism
uh so Alex Soros is his name the Sun and
you know he does say that defeating
Trump is still important
you know he was definitely going to be
political and even more political
and he says as long as money is part of
the process
money will be part of the process he'll
be part of that money process
however here's something he said that
uh I feel
gives you cause for hope
he says that he's a Bill Maher
Republican
another and he said he went to bed
watching you know Bill Maher at night
so so now you you have a pretty good
shorthand for where he is politically
are you worried about that
would you be worried let's say it's true
let's say it's true
and I don't think you'd make that up
right that doesn't sound like something
you just come up with to sound good or
something like that that sounds real
my guess is he's genuinely a fan of Bill
Barr what is Bill Maher's opinion
of the liberal prosecutors
do you know his opinion it's not a
Democrat opinion
Bill Maher says it's gone too far and
that the cities are hell holes and I'm
sure that you would think that the
prosecutors are some part of that
problem
so does that mean that Alex oros
might be influenced by The Bill Maher
position that things have gone too far
and that there the craziness level has
just reached an unsustainable level for
the Republic
what do you think give me all right I'm
just going to pull you if you if you
think that he's going to agree more with
George or Bill just say George or Bill
who do you think is going to be more
influenced by George's father George
Soros or Bill Maher
just show me in the comments see mostly
George's and you and that wouldn't be
surprising right you'd expect the father
to have a big impact
and some say Bill
yeah maybe uh I don't know
it looks like a 75 George 25 bill
coincidence
um
you could be right
now I do think that George will be
um influential on all the things that he
was already agrees with for example
I think the fact that George Soros was a
Democrat
largely guarantees that Alex will be one
has been one will continue to be one
so I would say I would agree that George
Soros is the primary influence because
he's going to do some
con some democrat
liberal stuff with his money
well I would say that Bill Maher is
going to be more influential on a narrow
question
such as the prosecutors now that doesn't
mean he'll stop funding him because I've
always thought that the funding was sort
of indirect you know I don't think he
wanted these specific outcomes he just
got them
um so I'm gonna I'm gonna say that the
sun will here's my prediction
that the sun will modify the things that
weren't working
because when somebody takes over they do
like to put their fingerprint on it
might be too early because the father's
still alive so at the moment he probably
just has to do whatever his father wants
you know just out of respect but
I would say fairly soon when his father
is a little bit more adamant I think the
Sun is going to look to correct
the excesses
and by that I mean giving money to Black
lives matter looks like a mistake in
retrospect wouldn't you say
it didn't really look like that much of
a mistake when it happened
but at the moment it looks like a huge
mistake it's just it wasn't obvious at
the time
now what about the prosecutors
when when they when George Soros first
had the idea of not putting people in
jail for non-violent crimes
do you think that maybe that sounded
like a good idea on paper
because I actually think I might have
been persuaded by that
I've heard the argument if you hear the
argument separate from what actually
happened
and you just heard it in a conceptual
State stop putting people in jail for
little stuff because once they get a
criminal record you know they get locked
into the criminal path because you can't
get a good job and you you know then you
get taken away and then your kid doesn't
have a father and then there's a whole
whole ripple effect
so I'm very much
in agreement with George Soros
that arresting people for small crimes
can make the life of their child their
child
much worse
however it's clear that nobody thought
it through to the ultimate conclusion
which is it destroys the retail uh
industry entirely and turns everybody
into a criminal because it's just too
easy to steal and get away with it
now do you believe that 37 year old uh
you know college educated Alex Soros
thinks that that what's happening right
now with the liberal prosecutors is
working
do you think if you were alone in a room
with him and said look do you think that
worked
is that why you planned
and a lot of you're almost all say yes
okay I'm going to disagree with you and
say that there's no chance he would say
that
not at all
I would put the odds at exactly zero
that he would say that worked out
because he's looking at the same news
you are right remember the Democrat news
is saying it didn't work
it's not just the Republicans it is now
a I would say it's a matter of obvious
fact that both the left and right can
see that the cities have been destroyed
by rampant crime
so you think that if you were alone with
him in a room he would say that worked
out the way we wanted
do you really believe that you really
believe he would say yes this is what we
were looking for
all right you got a little quiet there
didn't you
no there's no chance he thinks that
worked there really is no chance
I'll I'll respect your disagreement
okay
I will respect your disagreement because
I know where it comes from it's it's not
it's not an unthoughtful disagreement
it's a thoughtful disagreement so I
respect I disagree completely I think
there's zero chance
that privately he would say it worked
do you think I should ask him if he'll
talk to me
maybe do an interview
I think that would be very interesting I
understand that he's a Berkeley graduate
somebody said
so we both got that Berkeley Cal Bears
thing going so maybe you say yes
maybe say yes
anyway if I were him I would say yes
because uh for someone who has a mostly
conservative audience as I do
I would I would give him the friendliest
interview
because I don't start with the
assumption that they're all guilty of
everything
they might be I don't rule it out I'm
just I don't start with the assumption
that he's guilty I just don't have that
assumption
so maybe you wouldn't talk to me I think
that would make everything better
all right um
let's see
I've said this a few different ways but
I'll try it another way
um
in 2023
when somebody goes in public and says
no one is above the law how do you hear
that
because in 2023 what I hear is I'm going
to do some dictatorship now
I'm going to take away your civil rights
that's what I hear
I no longer hear this as some kind of a
statement of you know a constitutional
lofty ideals it just sounds like
something the dictator says before they
put your ass in jail
oh nobody's above the law
and you're in jail
it's amazing how that changed in the era
of trump because we can see now
I mean it's really really really obvious
that the law is being applied
differently you know you see the
shoplifters
coming in and taking what they want
is that is that equal application of the
law not even close
is Trump being treated the way anybody
would be treated well according to uh
the most storied and qualified lawyers
of all time no not even close
so to imagine that somebody could go in
front of the public and say nobody is
above the law
and not look like
a idiot
it's amazing they even still say it it's
just the dumbest thing you could say in
2023 when it's just so obviously not
true
yeah it's not true it doesn't even make
you look smart when you say it it now
makes you look like you're
a criminal basically you know what what
I see it when Jack Smith said that I
immediately thought he was just a
criminal
now not necessarily breaking a law but
not acting in the benefit of the
Republic not doing the job he was tasked
with doing and doing a hit piece on an
American citizen that happens to be an
ex-president
that's what I saw to me it just looked
like a criminal talking like a criminal
yeah why do you rob banks well that's
where the money is
that's what it sounded like to me
all right you following this UFO
whistleblower
all right uh I believe that almost none
of you believe the UFOs are real
and therefore Don't Believe The
Whistleblower am I right let me do
another quick survey do you believe that
the Whistleblower talking about the
aliens being in you know being possessed
how many of you believe it's true
yes or no
all knows on locals everyone is now 25
percent
all right uh we got uh
sprinkling of yeses on YouTube
well let me speak to the yeses the
people who think it's true we now have
new information that The Whistleblower
says that at least one of the vehicles
these captured UFOs is bigger on the
inside than on the outside
ah
huh where have I heard that before
it's a structure
some kind of a vessel or a ship that's
bigger on the inside than the outside
huh well there's Snoopy's doghouse
Snoopy's doghouse is bigger on the
inside than the outside and uh let's see
in Doctor Who there's the Tardis looks
like a phone booth but when you go
inside it's a whole big ship
yeah so how do you feel now
you you those of you who think that UFO
story and The Whistleblower true uh that
sound good
still and he also added that one of the
crafts is the size of a football field
yeah there's something the size of a
football field that crash landed and
nobody got a picture
you mean no but nobody outside the
government nobody got a picture yeah
so you're still feeling pretty good
about that uh
that UFO whistleblower
feeling pretty confident about that
all right
well the Unabomber died in prison and
some are saying it was suicide and
some were saying
I don't know I I'm not interested in the
unibomber
can I get can I get a vote of agreement
here we don't care about the Unabomber
do we
nobody cares
you know but yeah here's a true story
the Unabomber actually caused me some
problems
so the Unabomber and his situation
actually overlapped with my personal
life
true story so when the so when stuff was
blowing up and I make sure I got this
story right this I think this was the
Unabomber maybe it was a different
bomber but uh weren't they saying that
the packages had some way to tell that
they were uh maybe a problem because
it'd be something in the return address
it sounded like a tree or something
what there was some kind of signal that
uh or no return address or something
yeah so there was something we were told
that if the if the package looked
um sketchy
that you should call the police
well I actually got a sketchy package
that had a return address that had one
of the one of the sort of keywords in it
that tells you it might be a bomb
so I actually called the police
and uh they they took a look at it and
uh I was a public figure
so I was you know potentially somebody
in the Target list
and it was just just a fan
Mr fan sent me something unsolicited
but it did uh ruin my day
all right
let's talk about Ukraine and then the
pyramids
so there's very little news out of
Ukraine and even the very little news is
not reliable most of the news is uh
either Russian or Ukrainian source
showing a tank that got blown up by the
other side
or something like that basically you
can't tell anything from the videos and
reports just nothing at all but the
reports the news says that maybe Ukraine
took two Villages without much
resistance
that means about nothing because it's
not like every village is equally
protected so I don't know maybe they
weren't strategic so there's basically
no news
um
but the the thinking of the experts is
that the objective of the Ukrainian
counter-offensive
is to cut off the land bridge to Crimea
does that sound right
they want to cut off the land bridge to
Crimea but does that really mean that
they plan to take Crimea back
here's my prediction for the day
prediction for the day for addiction for
the day for addiction for the day
that Ukraine's objective is to cut off
Crimea and then negotiate
because I don't think they want to take
Crimea that would be
that would probably Wipe Out the whole
Army in the process
but they want to make it look like they
could
they want to make it look like any
moment now we're going to take your
Crimea away we we took your land bridge
away so it's harder to reinforce it but
we're going to take your Crimea back
and then they're going to negotiate
that's what I think
I saw Biden talking about when he was
vice president his trips to Ukraine how
many of you know how many trips Biden
made to Ukraine when he was vice
president
do you know how many
uh so he's saying 25
I think it was in the High Teens it was
like 17 or something
now how many times does any vice
president go to any specific country
during the term of the vice presidency
how many times has Kamala Harris gone to
Central America
once
once
can you give me any good reason why a
vice president would go to any foreign
country 17 times any country for
anything
I can't thank you Eddie I can think of
no legitimate government purpose for
going there 17 times and by the way
why didn't we know about it
are you telling me that during the Obama
presidency
that Biden went to Ukraine 17 times and
that was not news
that nobody mentioned how many times
he's going to this one place
yeah there's clearly something very very
wrong going on here clearly something
wrong
how is that not big news I never even
 cared about Ukraine until you
know the the recent dust up are you
telling me the Ukraine was so important
that Biden would go there 17 times or
whatever it was it's some number in that
range uh and we would never even hear
about it
I don't believe I saw one story about
that didn't you do you remember seeing
any news story about the vice president
traveling to another country
how is that not a story
I mean at least a mentioned
somebody says only six times I'd Biden
himself I saw a quote yesterday that was
way more than six times
now he might have been lying
but I guess that's another story
yeah that's too many times too many
times there's something wrong there
all right
um we're gonna talk about the pyramids
last because it's the most fun
so I saw that there are a bunch of links
to news stories claiming that those
Canadian fires are most clearly caused
by climate change
at the same time that the satellite
imagery shows that there were a whole
bunch of fires sat at exactly the same
time
genuinely genuinely curious
did the people who wrote those argue
articles blaming climate change did they
believe what they wrote
yeah you're you're saying it's lightning
but there's always been lightning
there's never not been lightning
right
but whether it was lightning or whether
it was arson and it certainly looks like
arson But whichever it was neither of
those have anything to do with forest
fires because the number of forest fires
is down it's not up it's down
so
but don't you wonder if the people who
wrote this story is actually believed
what they wrote
because usually
um
because usually
well anyway
um
yeah I just I'm just usually I think
people believe what they write but this
one doesn't look like yeah this doesn't
look like they believed it or they or
are they that clueless I mean it could
go either way
Rand Paul says there's a bunch of
Republicans that are beating the drums
of war with China
what
what
I I'd like to I'd like to know their
names
who exactly thinks a war with China
would be a good idea
we actually have some members of
Congress
they have an R next to their name who
are beating the drums for war
are you kidding me
who
so uh RFK Jr was tweeting the Rand Paul
thing
and uh RFK JR says you know basically we
should find a way to work with China
because a war with China would just be
insane I mean I don't know what else you
could say about it it would be literally
insane
and China knows that right you don't
start a war unless you have some chance
of winning
isn't that like the first rule of War
you don't start a war
unless you think you might win it
who thinks they could win a war with
China in the U.S how could that be
anything but the you know a huge gut
punch to civilization for the next 30
Years
how could it be anything but that
there's no there's no winning scenario
that anybody can even imagine in their
greatest imagination you can't imagine
winning
either side
there's no way he had to make wins so
why are they even talking about it
now if you're talking about it as you
know a thread or something like that as
part of the negotiation okay that would
be the the Trump method to just give
them an idea it might happen
but Rand Paul is suggesting that they're
serious about it
I I don't even know what to say about
that how did those people get reelected
I don't know
but uh RFK says in a tweet about this he
says ultimately our free market system
is superior to China's centrally
controlled one we can outcompete them in
peaceful competition as long as we stop
squandering our resources in Endless
Foreign Wars
most of that
um the trouble is that how do you
compete against low labor costs
I mean I get that robots can help us a
lot but ultimately you can't compete
against that I mean you can move your
business to another low
labor costs place but you can't you know
we're not going to lower the labor cost
of America so we don't really have a way
to compete against that directly but I I
do agree with the general point
you know between robots and moving our
business elsewhere yeah there's a lot of
stuff we can do and none of it requires
a war
so I like RFK Jr's instincts on this
the best
all right let's talk about
pyramids
so I watched a video on YouTube
yesterday that makes some claims that
I've seen before and I can't remember
the name of the video the video I wish I
could it's something like what
what the heck or something I don't know
but it's really good and all tweeted
around if I run into it again
but the the idea is this how many of you
believe that the ancient Egyptians you
know the direct descendants of the
people who live there today how many of
you think they built those pyramids
and that they forgot how they did it
does that sound
does that sound remotely possible to you
it doesn't to me honestly it never
sounded real to me I just don't believe
that the descendants used to know how to
build pyramids but now they don't
I no I'm sorry I just don't believe it
yeah and there are some people who say
the pyramids are older than uh the
civilizations that are there and some
people say it's aliens now do you know
that they've never found a mummy
a a dead leader in a pyramid
and we were taught we were taught in
school that these were burial tombs for
the dead leaders they had never found
one in there nor have they ever found
evidence one has ever been in there
there's one sarcophagus
but it doesn't look like it ever had a
body in it
and the and the one sarcophagus is not
even in an ornate pyramid it's in a
pyramid that doesn't even have like wall
writing so it doesn't look like it was
even made for a leader it looks like
it's a utility
right all right so here's the theory
that uh
I'm actually
a little bit convinced by
it goes like this
the the outside of the pyramids which
have mostly crumbled with age used to
have a a different kind of rock
that was covering the rough edges so
it's more smooth
and that kind of rock we know has uh
electrical insulation properties
right you had electrical insulation
properties I think it was limestone yeah
now that alone doesn't tell you much
because you know
rocks have different qualities they just
use limestone
but the the Limestone was covering the
base rocks and the base rocks were
tell me what the base rocks was but it
has it had a lot of crystal in it
sandstone
granite
was it gravit
whatever it was some kind of red granite
somebody says but whatever that rock was
apparently you had a lot of
crystals in it
now the nature of crystals is if you
compress them they create electricity
I'm sorry quartz quartz not crystals
courts courts courts courts not crystals
so there's courts of The Rock when you
compress quartz it turns into
electricity
now if you were to have a quartz watch
and you shook it
the shaking itself would be enough to
create electricity to run your watch
yeah the Piezo yeah Piezo electric
process
now apparently at least one of the
pyramids maybe all of them have an
aquifer underneath and the aquifer would
act to create noise and the noise would
travel up through the chambers and
create a vibration
and the vibration that it would create
would activate the courts
because any movement of the quartz
creates that little bit of electricity
and because the pyramids are massive
is sums up all those you know tiny
little electrical signals until you have
a massive electrical
power plant
and apparently there's some indication
that the top of the pyramid was gold
you know it was sort of like a
electrical conductor situation now
here's the fun part
did you know that inventor Nikolai Tesla
uh had plans to create a a generator
that would send you electricity through
the air so you didn't need power cables
did you know that did you know that he
built one and it worked
so he could he could stand across the
field with a just a light bulb in his
hand
and the light bulb would light up using
the electricity that had flown through
the air from his power plant at a
distance
it wasn't hypothetical
he actually built it and it worked
so he went to JP Morgan and he said to
him J.P Morgan uh can you give me some
money for this because Jacob Morgan was
the richest guy
and JP Morgan said no do you know why
because JP Morgan owned the competing
form of electricity Westinghouse he
owned the companies that made telephone
poles copper wires he he owned companies
that made every part of the process of
what you see as our modern grid
so he said no and Tesla never built his
machine
so it looks like the pyramids are
actually a Tesla
you know in the in the form of Tesla
kind of a power generating device that
was designed to send electricity through
the air to some recipient
which would also explain why the you
know the pyramids are largely in one
area
just like we would build a second power
plant where a current power plant is I
mean you would put them where you
already had one but you needed a little
more
so
I'm actually kind of persuaded by that
theory I'm not going to say it's 100
true
but I am now persuaded that there
probably was a civilization
that was advanced
came before us
and has died out
um
how did they learn that thousands of
years ago the idea would be that there
was once an advanced civilization that
was not related necessarily to the
ancient Egyptians but rather there was
somebody who knew how to do this stuff
and maybe had power over them or
influence and worked with the locals
because they needed a lot of Labor
to do this stuff
now I have another theory
if it's true that the pyramids were
about vibration
which that's the theory that it had to
vibrate at a certain level in order to
put out the electricity and so that the
entire design was to cause vibration of
a specific type
the Ancients who built that were big on
vibrations
do you think they could have used
vibration to cut the rocks
in other words could you let's say you
had a saw or a wire I don't know
something like that and you just use
vibrations
could you vibrate it enough that it
would uh make a clean slice through a
rock
just a question I've never seen anybody
try it but if they were if they were
capable enough
to create the pyramids as a power source
would that and using vibrations would
they also know enough have to use
vibration to cut the Rock
Maybe
maybe there's an exact vibration that
cuts Rock
how about that
if you were to try every every kind of
vibration against a rock with you know
some kind of cutting tool do you think
it would be the same at every vibration
but not I bet there's some if I
oh you think it would be
high pressure water can cause steel yeah
I've also thought about the high
pressure water
because they could do that right so here
here's how the Ancients could create a
high pressure water cannon
you because we know they they could move
large rocks
how would they do it they would uh just
put large rocks on top of a container of
water the large Rock would push it down
and put pressure on it and then they've
got a little hose thing and the pressure
comes out because there's a giant rock
on top of the water
you know that with a seal
so could the Ancients have built a a
powerful high pressure water cannon
I think they kind of
yeah I think they could have it would be
hard to get the uh the nozzle to work if
they didn't have good metal I suppose
but if they had a gold top on their
pyramid they knew how to work with metal
a little bit
well okay maybe they had electricity so
they just had power tools maybe that's
it
uh maybe they had the flex hose I just
bought one of those
they have no pictures so they never
documented it
uh
all right what do you think of that
theory
would that explain everything
to me that answers all the questions oh
no it doesn't explain everything what
would be unexplained by
uh the Y files oh I think I think is
that what I was talking about was that
the Y files
that might be the one I'm talking about
we have a water a y in the name
Dunning Kruger
I'm not sure what sense you're using
that
stones are still a mystery yes
don't do volume only elevation
oh that that's true
um check the hieroglyphics
yeah the hieroglyphics apparently there
are no hieroglyphics on any pyramids
that show how the big rocks were moved
can you believe that
the most impressive amazing part of
building a pyramid is how do you move
those big rocks and there's not a single
hieroglyphic that shows that move in any
big rocks
wouldn't that be like the most likely
thing to be on the wall
it's too dumb
uh there's no yeah there's no there's
also no pictures of the leaders on the
walls which would suggest they're not
very burial tombs
canals and sluice Gates
yes so one theory is that they use
canals and sluice gates to float the
rocks
um which was a re I I saw the video on
how they did that that was a reasonably
good hypothesis
yeah that was a reasonably good
hypothesis
all right that ladies and gentlemen is
all I needed to talk about today it was
there any story I missed
anything in the news that you wish
I had talked about
everything is frequency
and vibration you're right
transgester that was just a meme
um
Sphinx is older than the pyramids yeah
the Sphinx is
uh now crack me up I'm wrong did I see
that uh
there's more than one Sphinx
there's the Egyptian Sphinx but there's
at least one other thing somewhere right
there's one great one but there are
other ones
yeah
in Las Vegas uh I I think the fact that
there are other sphinxes built you know
in the ancient times
suggests that uh there's some common
civilization that touched The Primitives
all right
um it's used to intimidate
um
all right I'm gonna say uh bye to
YouTube thanks for joining the best live
stream ever see you tomorrow
