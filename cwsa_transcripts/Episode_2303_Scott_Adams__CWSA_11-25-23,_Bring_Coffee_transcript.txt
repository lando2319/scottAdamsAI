canteen Jer flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dop me the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sipping
happens now
go consider yourself
colonized
well um news of the day is that I guess
yesterday uh
Derek Chauvin the police officer who was
convicted of murdering George Floyd he
was a stabbed impr prison by another
inmate and quite seriously
injured uh when did that happen uh Derek
shauvin was stabbed on Black Friday
Black Friday he was
stabbed now that's probably a
coincidence
right probably a coincidence
I think so not sure all right at the
same time the documentary the fall of
Minneapolis is
trending now the fall of Minneapolis is
the one that uh calls out the whole uh
George Floyd hoax because it's pretty
obvious I think to objective people he
did not die from Derek chauvin's actions
but rather from fenel it's like really
really obvious when you when you watch
the
documentary super
obvious there's no doubt about it when
you watch it and so as martyr made a ex
user noted that the stabbing of Chauvin
is a uh is basically a slow motion
execution um for being a white guy
basically so this is a the biggest
miscarriage of Justice since the January
Sixers but we're starting to get used to
white people being put in jail for
political reasons
reasons uh you probably shouldn't get
used to that that would be my guess
don't get used to that don't get used to
that it's probably a bad
idea well big surprise uh the New York
City police force is losing police
officers at an alarming
rate uh 2500 turned over their badges in
2023 and and the whispers are that
everybody's just waiting for their 20
years to click or whenever they can get
a pension and get the hell out of
there what is not mentioned is the
ethnicities of the cops I wonder if
they're leaving in
roughly uh you know roughly
proportionate to their ethnic
mix do you think there's any group
that's more likely to believe in the
police
force I know Derek schauen would uh make
me quit if I were a police officer i'
I'd quit immediately because if you
don't have support from your community
you really being a police officer is a
dumb idea don't wouldn't you agree if
your community does not support you
being a police officer is a terrible job
option terrible but you know maybe
robots won't take that job so it's got
that going for it uh and in the midst of
this I guess there's massive overtime
because there are not enough police
officers but the massive overtime will
make it even hard harder because
there'll be fewer police officers
because they'll quit because of the
massive overtime which I guess is a big
issue so the fewer there are the more
rapidly they'll quit so we we have a
death
spiral that's That's a classic death
spiral the more people quit the more
overtime the more overtime the more
people quit the more overtime so that's
a that's actually a death
spiral and uh in the midst of all that
in the Immigrant uh population
increasing
mayor Adams has canel the next five
Police Academy classes so you won't have
new ones and the impetus for the ones
that are already there to quit is
greater than it's ever been before now
one of the things I would ask you is who
quits the police force
first who who are the ones that just get
right out right away well there's ones
who are retiring of course or can retire
but I would think it would be the most
capable cuz people were high capable can
get other jobs people who are just
barely hanging on probably lucky to have
the job they have so I would expect that
the quality of the police force would
take a a huge nose dive at the same
time but speaking of jobs I saw some
estimate it was in Forbes that half of
all jobs will will be AI in 2
years I don't think so I don't think so
at all I think where we're adding is
that uh people will just use AI to do
their
job you know where let me give you the
the most obvious one the most obvious
one is they say uh Voice work like voice
dubbing and and voice voiceovers will
turn to AI do you know what's wrong with
that well it might be that the people
who used to be the voice actors will be
on a work but it's still going to
require a person to tell the AI to make
the
book and it's still going to take a
person to determine which voices the one
to use and it's going to take a person
to decide if it's right and it's going
to take a person to decide if you know
which parts of the book to read and
which ones to add it and stuff like that
I think it's just going to be a tool so
it might be true that the voice person
loses their job but then they're just
replaced with another human who has to
manage the AI to make sure ites does the
right thing to make the voice recording
and I think that's the way it's going to
go with all the jobs there there'll be
some you know niche of jobs that
definitely do go away but then more
likely we're just using it as a
tool let's take uh one of the one of the
things on the jobs on the list of things
that will go away is
cartoonist do you think cartoonist is
going to go away I don't know let's uh
let's ask chat GPT to write us a
joke let's do this right now let's see
chat
GPT Let's uh let's get a good joke going
here can you tell me a funny
joke sure why did the Scarecrow win an
award because he was outstanding in his
field scarecrow won an award because he
was outstanding in his
field does that sound like a that's the
one got a chuckle out of
you do you have a funnier joke that one
wasn't very
funny sure thing why don't scientists
trust Adams because they make up
everything did she just say that
scientists don't don't trust
Adams why don't they trust me nope not
algorithms scientists don't trust Adams
because they make up everything it's a
play on words anything else you'd like
to chat about did did you say that
scientists Don't Trust Scott
Adams no not Scott Adams scientists
don't trust Adams it's a joke about the
smallest particles that make up
everything are you anything else you're
curious about are you saying Scott Adams
is a small
particle no sorry for any confusion I
was talking about Adams not Scott Adams
well let's switch gears is there a
specific topic or question you have in
mind my point
is I don't think it's going to be
funny I I mean I was funnier than the
app just talking to
it right I I I was funnier than the app
and the app was trying as hard as it
could to be funny and I wasn't even
trying I was like you you can be funnier
than AI without even much effort at all
now here's your lesson why was it funny
when I was talking to it but it wasn't
funny when it told the joke well it
wasn't funny when it told the joke
number one you've already heard those
jokes those are old
jokes number two AI doesn't uh can't
read the Zeitgeist the Zeitgeist is the
sort of thing that everybody's thinking
but maybe they haven't set it out loud
yet you know what what is the feeling
everybody's getting so for example uh if
the news is causing people to have an
anxiety or a feeling about something in
particular then a human humorist can
feel that because they're part of the
Zeitgeist and so then we'll make a joke
about that and you'll say oh that's new
that's just what I was thinking and
that's what makes it
funny but if AI just looks at jokes that
have been told before by humans which is
currently how learns it's going to be a
derivative boring ordinary joke that's
been around 40
years but I can tell a joke that
wouldn't have been funny a week ago just
think about that I can tell you a joke
that wouldn't have been funny one week
ago right because I'm I'm in I'm surfing
the social feeling that the rest of you
are feeling as well so no um I don't
think cartoonist is going to go away yet
and I would go further and say again
that all art is dependent on the
artist everything that you like about
art your art appreciation is because of
what you consciously or subconsciously
think about the person who made it it's
not about the art it's about the
connection between the art and the
person who made it as soon as you take
the person who made it out of the
equation it'll just lay there like a
turd there's there's a uh
AI demonstration was on X today somebody
made it it shows a lifelike singer so
the image is created by AI it's not a
real person and this AI person is
singing an AI song which to me sounded
like every Taylor Swift song I've ever
heard did I like it no I also don't like
Taylor Swift songs I think that they're
just very ordinary like no nothing about
a Taylor Swift song has ever interested
me the least but it might be because I'm
not interested in Taylor Swift imagine
if I were a i 12-year-old
girl would I be interested in Taylor
Swift as an artist absolutely because
she'd be like maybe what I want to grow
up to be you know my hero or something
so if my hero makes a song Maybe I like
it better but I don't really have any
connection or like there's nothing about
I I don't dislike Taylor Swift she's
very successful must be very
smart but it doesn't really do anything
for
me and I would argue that if Taylor
Swift the human were not uh associated
with their music you wouldn't listen to
it you would not listen to her music if
the only thing you knew about it is how
it sounded and that's the problem with
AI it just be how it sounds you just
would never listen to that the the fact
that Taylor Swift does songs about old
boyfriends how much does that matter to
her to how much you appreciate it a lot
that the fact that you probably think
the song was about a real person in a
real situation completely changes your
impression of
it so I'm a optimist about human
employment um the newest Wrinkle in that
in those tunnels beneath that chifa
hospital in Gaza remember first people
were saying hey maybe there's no tunnels
under there and then Israel did a you
know uh did a great job of finding them
and Excavating them you know because
they' had been filled in with some sand
and you know they got rid of the booby
traps and they showed you a long video
of the actual
tunnels and then today we find
out amazingly today we find out that the
tunnels were built by Israel did you see
that story yet that that I'm not making
this up the tunnels under the shifa
hospital were built by Israel according
to Israel's ex- prime minister and that
it was decades ago and it was a favor to
the hospital to give them more just more
space because the hospital was in you
know crowded
area now some are saying that that
proves that it was not being used by
Hamas which is a whole different subject
so who built them is way less important
than whether Hamas was using it as a
headquarters and Israel says yes so
Israel says yes all the signs are there
but of course it's like every other
story in the world people will say I
don't believe
them um but it seems very unlikely to me
that it was not being used by Hamas how
how many of you think you're you're
satisfied that it was exactly what it
looked like it was a
Hamas uh
asset I think so if I had to
bet because if it just been used by the
hospital it would have been hard to make
it look like it wasn't just used by the
hospital if the hospital was using it
there would have been you know supplies
down there I no I don't believe any of
it I I'm pretty sure it was some
El all
right um let me give you a history
lesson I will uh preface this with what
I call my opinion
sandwich the opinion sandwich means that
I might say something that would get me
in trouble but I'm going to sandwich it
between two things that make it
okay first part of the sandwich I
completely 100% support Israel's right
of
self-defense and what they're doing in
Gaza right so I'm completely behind
Israel and when I'm done with what I'm
saying I'm going to say that that again
so that's that has to be the sandwich
and I just wondered this is a general
information question if I asked you most
of you know that when Israel was formed
1948 that some number of uh Palestinian
types who live there were
expelled how many people do you think
who lived there who would have
identified as Palestinian I guess uh how
many of them do you think were expelled
in 1948 give me a
number I'm not going to tell you the
right number until I see but but even if
you don't know take your best guess like
what what's it feel
like some seeing numbers
from no it's not 25 I that's the 25 is a
joke when people writing 25 that's a
that's a call back to a
joke
how many do you
think and then and then separately what
percentage of the when I say Palestinian
I mean that's what they would call
themselves it wasn't wasn't called the
country of Palestine but what percentage
of
them all right so it turns out that if
you try to search for it you get
different numbers so some some say
700,000 people say 700 some say
750,000 some sources say half of the
residents were um expelled some say
75% that's a lot of
people do you know what it was
called how many of you know what that
situation was called by the
Palestinians yeah if you see this word
neba which they would say is still
happening
neba does that mean Exodus what does
that
mean yeah so imagine imagine
700,000
Palestinians and then imagine the birth
rate of Palestinians since then pretty
high birth rate wouldn't we be talking
about several million people who were
either directly expelled or the children
of people expelled it's a lot of
people yeah
now I'm not going to give you an opinion
of what is right or wrong or who owns
the territory I actually am not
interested in any of their
history um I I'm very much whoever can
hold a place militarily owns it
unfortunately you you could talk all day
about who should own it but it won't
make any
difference whoever can own it is going
to own it that's just the way the world
works so you don't you know the the
conversation of who should own it just
sort of fun but
irrelevant uh all
right and then I will sandwich that
comment by saying I'm 100% beside be
behind Israel in their self-defense and
what they have to do to get rid of
Hamas all right uh Marco
Rubio is uh coming out strong again he's
been saying this for a while about
banning Tik Tock and here's what I'd
like to say about Senator Marco
Rubio thank than you for getting this
exactly
right I I've gotten really discouraged
about our government for not being able
to even explain Tik Tock much less have
an opinion if you can't explain it like
what's the problem you really need to
not be part of that conversation if you
can't even explain the problem so uh
Rubio correctly and perfectly explains
that yes there's a data data sensitivity
problem but it's not the big problem the
big problem is that China has a direct
user interface to American mines and you
cannot compare that to an American made
or an American-owned company which also
may be spreading some propaganda but at
least it's American I mean if it if it's
coming from China that is a whole
different conversation than the fact
that maybe Facebook is you know pushing
you know one side of the political
argument that's really different
yeah so good for you Marco Rubio um I
appreciate that that's some that's some
good governmen in there good Senator
ringing so good job there uh the
wh is suggesting masks being reinstated
in China and social distancing they have
some new kind of mystery respiratory
illness happening there
as others have pointed out does all of
this feel a little bit too
familiar a little bit too familiar yeah
we got uh Trump leading in the polls
election coming up and oh surprise there
might be another pandemic Brewing coming
from
China all right um I don't know if you
heard about this but the Democrats have
a put out just before Thanksgiving a
handy guide for responding to your crazy
Mega nonsense that's what it actually
says I'm not saying that the actual
guide now it's tongue and cheek but it's
also a little bit
serious um it's a handy guide for
responding to crazy crazy Mega
nonsense so I helpfully included the uh
hoax quiz so that you could take that
with you to your next family gathering a
lot of people said who who would tell
people to argue with their family on a
holiday to which I say I don't think
that's going to cause you to argue with
them I don't think that's going to make
the argument
so anyway that's happening uh Politico
sounding the alarm as they like to say
when you talk about news stories it's
one way that the traditional news always
says somebody sounded the
alarm um it's pretty cliche but anyway
politicos talking about Biden's poll
numbers aren't just bad they're getting
worse so now Biden is basically losing
in every
pole and you know most of the
demographics although the demographic
about losing the young vote is still not
completely agreed on by all the
pollsters so there's a little
disagreement on that um
how in the
world like how are the Democrats going
to handle this do you think they're
going to have to assassinate their own
candidate you know I here here's the
thing that comes to mind we keep
thinking that uh Trump is at risk
because you think about JFK Jr no I'm
sorry you think about
JFK the assassination of JFK and you
think wow
could it be that our deep State blob
would actually try to kill a candidate
for president Trump and then you think
about it some more and you say wouldn't
it be easier to kill
Biden because if they replace Biden
they've got a a fighting chance of
winning the election
outright but if they keep him in there
it's Trump do you think do you think
that the blob um I'm not saying that I
know anybody's planning anything like
this I'm just speculating because it's
fun but if you were if you were like the
worst people in the Democrat blob you
know the people who do anything to win
is your best play to take Trump out or
Biden what's your best
play I'm pretty sure the best play is
think Biden now so you might have this
weird situation well both of course but
you're your weird
situation that the Democrats might need
to assassinate their own leader to have
a chance of
winning that'd be weird now when I say
assassinate I don't mean
literally I mean they might have to just
come up with some kind of an OP that
takes them out here's what I'm going to
here's what I
expect I think that the The Blob will
keep pushing Biden every way they can
push
him and if he doesn't get pushed because
he needs to protect his family and have
the pardon
ability I think they're going to drop
the dime on
him I I think the blob is going to tell
you the stuff that you don't know about
yet like the good stuff the thing the
thing that everybody in Washington
probably knows but nobody has quite you
know proof so they don't say it out loud
I got a feeling that the blob is going
to drop a dime on Biden and it's going
to happen really soon because the sooner
it happens the better
now I don't think it'll happen over
Christmas so I I'm going to look at
January what when when is the first
uh primary first primary is
in March first one so you don't want to
wait till
February it's going to be January you
don't you don't want it to get like
caught up with the holiday
news I think January they're going to
take him out all right let do you want
to go with that
prediction that the The Blob will take
out Biden it won't be Republicans it'll
be the blob The Blob meaning Democrats
and people who agree with them the media
who agrees with them the intelligence
people agree with them you all those
yeah we used to go out the Deep state
but I think blob is a better I like blob
better that's why U Mike Ben used that
all right
uh V ramaswami is uh pitching the idea
that the next GOP debate should be on
the xplatform and hosted by Tucker
Carlson what do you think of that you
think the next Republican debate should
be on
X I will remind you that Tucker
Carlson's numbers for his shows are
something like aund times bigger than
any network ever like there there's no
there's no comparison to the size of the
audience X would be way bigger so so
what would the New York Post editorial
group say about this idea so the New
York Post being the traditional
media um so here's what their editorial
board
said they said oops V ramaswami just
inadvertently revealed that his once
promising presidential campaign has
devolved into a sad bid for social media
Fame I didn't see that in the story what
part of the story about him wanting to
use the biggest
platform for a debate which part is the
admitting that he just wants to be a
social media
star wouldn't it make more sense that V
knows he has an advantage online and so
an online debate would likely get him a
better outcome than a television debate
which would be senior citizens but it
but he probably has more young support
so if he puts on X against more young
people gets a better outcome people say
hey you did better in that debate plus
more people saw it plus plus Tucker
Carlson would ask better
questions and the way the New York Port
post says it is he's devolved into sad
bid for social media
Fame that is a sad
sad uh
editorial that is so weak oh my God and
transparent and then they say to follow
up their Ridiculousness the New York
Post editorial says sure he claimed it
would be a way to increase viewership
but you don't get a larger Audience by
making something harder to
watch has the New York Post ever seen
the
news does a New York Post editorial
staff not now that Tucker Carlson's
audiences are 100 times bigger than
traditional
media am I what what is the actual
percentage it's like a 100 times bigger
right we're not talking about two things
in the same
category one's a 100 times
bigger you know I don't know if it's a
100 but it's a lot bigger it's not even
close well that's that it's Just sh
talking what you can put in a in an
opinion piece so obviously this is just
more about the business model of the
press they want to keep
it all right
um there was apparently some new UAP
legislation that's
Brewing which would add transparency to
all the UFO claims and it would be some
kind of law that would allow the public
to see more than we've seen so far now
everybody thinks that's a good idea
right everybody
don't you think the public should know
everything our government knows about
UFOs just seems like an obvious good
thing but it turns out that there are
four Republican members of the gang of
eight uh and this is the people who have
classified
intelligence so these are the people who
do know the secrets that you don't know
there are four people who know the
actual secrets about the so-called UFOs
or maybe it's a new technology
and they don't want the public to know
it and as V
says
why what what do they
know H does it does it bother you at all
that the people who know the most about
it don't believe the public should be
allowed to
know H let us speculate why that might
be speculation number one
they believe there's something
real but there's
not that's a possibility right there
could be four Republicans who believe
there's really something there and they
don't want you to know because you might
Panic right so it could be they
mistakenly believe something that's not
true there's a good chance of that
actually another
possibility is that it's um American
Technology
and we don't want anybody to know we
have this American Technology but that
wouldn't explain why other people who
also know the top secret information
think it would be okay for the public to
know can you see any scenario in which
the the reality of the uaps is top
secret American
Technology and yet four people who know
that would be willing to tell the
public I can't imagine anybody who knew
that you knew that to be true would want
to tell the public about top secret
military
technology that doesn't make sense so
I'm going to I'm going to eliminate from
the option
set I'm going to eliminate that it's
it's American
Technology now suppose we knew it was
somebody else's technology like Chinese
technology Would we not want to tell the
public that
I feel like we might want to tell the
public that because we told them about
the Spy
balloons right it would just be another
technology now would it be because uh
Americans would be too afraid of the new
technology probably not probably
not
so I feel like the best um just guess of
why there might be four Republicans who
don't want you to know is that they
don't know what it is
I think it's more likely that the four
Republicans who want to keep it close to
the vest still don't know if it's human
technology or alien or what and they'd
rather just not take a
chance I don't know what do you think
what what do you think is the main
reason that they wouldn't want to tell
you but other people who know the same
information would be willing to tell
you I think it has to come down to
whether you believe it's real
I bet it comes down to that it's also
possible that it would reveal something
about America that we don't want to
reveal for example we know there's one
historical example where the I believe
it was the CIA and it's in writing uh
that somebody in the CIA once
specifically recommended planting fake
UFO stories to divert from the real
things they were doing so we know that
that that happened at least as a
suggestion once in history so it's not
like it's unheard of or crazy so here's
my here's my other
hypothesis that um there are at least
four Republicans who know that our
intelligence agencies plant these
stories
intentionally and they may not want to
take that tool away from the
intelligence people because maybe
sometimes planting a fake story is just
what you need
maybe I don't
know yeah they do it does look like an
intentional distraction to me that's
what it looks
like so I'm going to go with we'll never
know probably but I'm going to go with
there are four Republican uh candidates
who know it would reveal something about
the way we
operate that would
be uh
unproductive some something about the
way the government operates and informs
its citizens that's so unsavory that
maybe better we didn't know According to
some
people that's just my
guess all right what else is
happening um there's a story in I think
it was
Newsweek that uh there are many excess
black
deaths and the reasons given are uh
could be wealth a wealth effect so
apparently there are two things
correlated one is um poverty so poverty
is associated with worse outcomes but
also the same excess deaths
exist um there are more black deaths
among college educated black women than
non- colge educated white
women they're actually more deaths
excess test of college educated black
women than white women who didn't go to
college so in another words we've
narrowed it down to two things there are
two things that will cause excess black
deaths one is
poverty and the end and the other thing
that will cause it is no
poverty so two situations that cause it
poverty and no
poverty because we we assume that the uh
the black women with college degrees are
probably making more money than the
white women without college
degrees so in both cases if they have
money or don't have money they die and
uh the article attributes this to
systemic racism so systemic racism is
why uh black people will die if they're
successful and also why they're not
successful because of the systemic
racism that all made sense to you didn't
it
did did all did that sound like
ridiculous
nonsense yeah it sounds like ridiculous
nonsense to me I don't know what's true
I don't know what's true but I know this
is
so
um and there's another study I'm not
sure I believe any studies
anymore I'm not even sure why I bring
them up they're all going to be debunked
in a month but there's a study that says
that there were uh on the on the
positive side if you like if you like
this as a positive there were 32,000
extra
births probably because um abortion
became illegal in a number of states
after the big Supreme Court
decision so do you believe this there
were
32,000 babies born that would have been
aborted if it were easier to abort
them does that sound true do do you
think convenience was the only reason
that 32,000 babies were born that if you
had to drive somewhere or maybe pay
extra seem to have a little problem here
with one of my
devices one of my devices appears to be
underpowered which I'm going to fix
while you
watch going in
there
fixed all
right so um and then other people are
saying this is a good
news is it good news is it good news
that these babies who would have been
aborted were
born well if you think that you know um
life is sacred then absolutely yes but
here's the question I ask you you for
Morality
reasons and this is not an opinion this
is a
question for those of you who say the
32,000 extra bursts were sort of a
blessing how good is it to be born when
you weren't
wanted now I know there are lots of
times that works out great you know the
mother will say you know I didn't choose
this but I'm sure glad I had this
baby what what percentage of the 32,00
are going to be born into a like a
hellscape of you know no love and
poverty and one parent and every problem
in the
world does did that make the world a
better
place suppose you knew that half of them
were going to be born into a horrible
situation and the mother knew it the
mother knew it that's why she wouldn't
have done
it would would you be okay let's say
hypothetically this just me this is just
a a mental experiment and I'm not
showing you my opinion I'm there's no no
opinion of mine in this it's actually a
genuine question if you knew you could
create 32,000 extra babies by getting
rid of abortion but you also knew that
half of them would be born into just the
worst
situation is that still morally that's
still the correct thing to
do I see always I see
NOS I see
yeses mostly yeses some NOS a little bit
of a disagreement
yeah yep now how for how many of you is
the question and again this is not my
opinion I'm just actually
curious for those of you who say you
know life is sacred is that informed
entirely by religious belief or would
you say that if you didn't have any
religious belief is your belief in the
the sanctity of life I guess is that
based on entirely religious or sort of
just feeling how it feels and thinking
how you
think both
depends uh I'm
atheist AOC believes
that
we got an anti-semite
here the rights of others are not your
purview
dickwad what the rights of
others you're not talking to me are
you yeah you know so here's the question
it comes down to
this um some would say that you know
life is life and if God decided there
was going to be a
life then you know who are you to take
it I get that I understand that point
but is there anything to Quality of
Life does quality of life have no um no
impact let me let me make it more
complicated just so we think this
through
properly if we're looking at those
hostages in
Gaza what would be more
valuable what lives are any of those
lives more valuable than others for
example when you're if you're giving
back a hostage that's 80 years
old you know we're happy to get any
hostage back but an 80-year-old has you
know maybe 5 years of extra life
left a child would have you know 100
years are those the same same
value no I'm not playing God I'm asking
you would would you put them at the same
value if he had to choose I mean we'd
rather not choose but if you had to same
value or different value because one is
a 100 years of life and the one is five
years life if you value life you would
value the maximum years of life on
average so I don't have an opinion on
that I'm just asking you if you do all
right
secondly which is more
immoral uh stopping somebody's life
before they knew they had a life and
again this is not I'm not giving you any
opinion on abortion I'm just asking you
your opinion which is more moral to stop
a fetus from growing you would call it
murder some would call it an
abortion is that worse if you knew the
person was going to be born into a life
of
misery would it be better to for someone
who's never even understood that they're
alive they don't even know they're alive
they have no no conscious understanding
of even being alive would it be better
to stop that if you knew they were going
to be born into
misery which is more ethical is it more
ethical to create a life of
misery or to prevent a life of misery
before anybody even knew they had a life
at all
no one right no one knows the future so
you would be operating only on
statistical likelihood that is correct
so you you'd have to make a statistical
choice but that doesn't really change
the equation too
much how would you know no it's not
about knowing it's about statistical
likelihood so if you've got let's say a
mother who uh that has no employment
possibilities is
single maybe is addicted to drugs you
know whatever it is but I think you
could pretty well determine which ones
are going to have a tough time of it and
and and doesn't matter that you would
only be right 90% of the time would that
change your decision well 10% of the
time it would be a good
life is that is that the way you think
about
it now don't give me the Kobe Maru of
they should just not have the get
pregnant like we all get that but you
know once you are pregnant how do you
make the
decision chaos Corner says you're lost
in the woods Scott now that's cognitive
dissonance that's cognitive
distance um because you can't handle the
questions right if you can't handle the
question you you go personally after the
the speaker I didn't give you any
opinion at all so why am I lost if I
didn't give you an opinion so that
you're having a mental event because the
questions are too difficult for you to
kick
around that's called playing God playing
God is called word thinking word
thinking is not part of the
conversation yeah it if you can replace
all the thinking with like little bumper
sticker phrases they're playing God or
It's A Life That's word thinking we all
know what it
is you know giving it a label doesn't
change what it
is more brains are better for
Humanity yeah we all play God that's
true Scott can handle the heat of the
kitchen yeah I
can
um you're only playing God when you do
nothing what
saying it's evil well all right let me
ask you this question how many of you
believe that
evil exists as a force as opposed to
just the label you put on something you
don't like how many think evil is like a
real
thing you think it's real and do you
think it's coming from a a source is the
evil emanating from a source as in
Satan so how many of you believe evil is
real and it emanates from
Satan I know Soros is the funny
answer how many and how many think that
evil is real whether or not Satan is
real I don't even understand that
honestly for those who say evil is real
I I neither agree with it or disagree
with it like what the does that
mean you actually know what that
means for for those of you who have a
solid opinion that evil is real you must
know what it
is what the hell is it is it like a
force is it like gravity you can measure
it but you can't grab a handful of it
you know it's certainly something that
you can
measure in terms of you know is there
more murder or less murder you know you
can measure that but does that mean evil
exists or does just mean that the system
is creating more
murders yeah so I can't agree with you
that evil exists because I don't even
understand that what you're talking
about to me that there's there's no part
of my brain that can even handle that
question so I think that's a religious
frame what do you call someone who eats
children
hungry there was my glib answer that's
right what do you call somebody who eats
children
hungry no there we we know that we there
is uh mental
illness we know there is
cruelty we know that if you take that
captagon drug you'll do things that you
would do if you didn't take that drug we
know that people can be brainwashed to
do the most horrible
things is a brainwashed person operating
under the force of evil or under the
force of
brainwashing or is it the same thing so
the the whole evil question is sort of a
how it feels to me is an escape from
thinking when when thinking is too too
painful it's easier to just replace it
with a word uh I don't want to think
about to ourselves say
evil uh what caus it well evil no maybe
if you thought about this with a little
more depth you might see that some kind
of cause and effect based on you know
the person how they were born plus how
they were raised and maybe you could do
something about no it's just evil nope
Satan just evil to me using evil as a
explanation of anything is uh just
saying you don't want to think about it
that's what it that's what it sounds
like to my ears because I don't think
evil is real e evil is just a word you
put on something you didn't
like um evil is a summary evil is an
adjective
disagree well if you have a religious
interpretation then you would disagree
of
course
do you think good is real
no no I don't think there's good and
evil I think there's just what people do
and then we put labels on it after the
fact because I believe in cause and
effect so well let me put it in this in
this um do let me ask you this question
here's a religious question for
you do you have to do you have to
believe that Free Will exists in order
for evil to exist I don't know the
answer to this question can can you have
evil if there's no free
will some say you can't have evil unless
there's free
will some say you
can
yes okay so free will to me is a uh
in my to my satisfaction it's been
proven scientifically to not exist so I
think science has proven that Free Will
is
imaginary um and if Free Will is
imaginary then evil doesn't make a lot
of sense to me it's just cause and
effect so let let me let me tell you why
I see
it if I if I take a rock and I drop it
and it just drops on the ground is that
evil no just a rock dropping on the
ground if I drop that rock on my foot
and it hurts my
foot is that
evil just cause and
effect so to me you know if somebody is
born a cannibal you know there's
something about their genetic makeup and
then on top of that their upbringing
turns them into a cannibal that's just
like somebody dropping a rock on their
foot you don't like a rock on your foot
you don't like that the guy ate your son
oh I hate the rock on my foot and I hate
the guy eating my son but it was just
cause and effect you know gravity caused
the rock to go down genetics plus
environment caused the cannibal to eat
your
son well this is
interesting why do I have the power
plugged in and YouTube says it's going
to quit got some kind of a power issue
here going on I don't what it is all
right well anyway I think I'm done uh
YouTube thanks for joining it's kind of
a slow Saturday after bre Black Friday
and uh we'll have lots more interesting
news another day but I don't think this
weekend is going to be a big news day
thanks for joining YouTube talk to you
tomorrow
