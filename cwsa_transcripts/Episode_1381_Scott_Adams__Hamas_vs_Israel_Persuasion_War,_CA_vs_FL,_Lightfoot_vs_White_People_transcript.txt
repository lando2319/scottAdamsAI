hey everybody come on in
it's time for coffee with scott adams
and let me tell you my printer is
working
perfectly today and if that isn't a good
sign of
good things ahead i don't know what is i
really don't know and if you'd like to
date
to be amazing all you have to do
is participate in the simultaneous sip
that's coming up and all you need is a
copper bunker glass of tango challenge
to stay in a canteen jugger flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
really unparalleled the dopamine hit of
the day
the whole day it's called the
simultaneous sip and
watch it go it happens now go
now i saw in the comments that somebody
is doing the simultaneous sip
from a train you have to watch out for
that because
as einstein warned there is no preferred
frame
for the simultaneous zip well you can
work out the math
so many of you had said to me
hey scott why is the volume so low on
your
podcast but other people have higher
volume
what's up with that scott well i just
did some research and it turns out that
everybody who uses
an ipad has the same problem
so there's something about the ipad that
doesn't do
volume recording correctly but
reportedly
the iphone does not have that issue
so as an experiment i might do an iphone
recording
and just see if the audio is any
different uh problem is i don't want to
do these
on my iphone because i can't see your
comments the screen would be too small
but i could use an external screen so i
might have a work around
maybe all right
do you remember the news that in the
arizona
election audit you had heard that there
was some big database
that had been deleted do you remember
that story
big old database was deleted and if
that's true
well then there's some shenanigans but
it turns out it's not true
what should be your immediate
assumption when you hear any initial
news command of uh an audit
your initial assumption should be every
time
that's not true just
just have a little recording running in
your head now
at the end of the audit presumably there
will be some claims or not
but if there are some claims there'll be
ones that other people need to verify
etc but anything you hear before the end
when things have really been nailed down
and they've got a
solid opinion everything you hear until
then
probably probably
not definitely you know i'm not saying
that the i'm not saying the audience
won't find anything
i'm not saying i'm not saying they will
i'm just saying that anything you hear
early it's just not likely to be true
you know it's it's fog of war situation
so
i don't recall if i called bs on this
when i first heard it
maybe you could remind me can somebody
remind me how i reported this the first
time
i've got that selective memory thing
going on right now
did i say in public that i wasn't so
sure that was true
or did i just report it as something
that's being claimed
all right in the comments somebody says
you did oh i did
okay you said to ignore it oh
well how about that i couldn't remember
if i had called bs on this
before we knew it was bs oh okay
well let me claim that as let me claim
that as a
an accomplishment of sorts
um do you know how to tell when
something
that you've created is really good
and people will care about it and buy it
or whatever
versus creating something that people
might say
that's pretty good that's pretty good
but they don't do anything with it they
don't buy it
and i have a rule for that that i use
quite a bit
and it works every time as far as i can
tell
if somebody takes your product whether
it's a writing product or a physical
product whatever
and they they they use it um in a way
that makes them
physically act in some way in which
in which they're trying to promote it or
extend it or
improve upon it then you really have
something
if people take your product and modify
it
you really have something all right it's
only when they don't care
that you're done right then uh you know
i don't care it's good it's fine
i just don't care and i've never seen
more activity since really the dilbert
comment came out there was a lot of
activity around that
but when my book had failed almost
everything and still
win big came out in 2013.
it was a success a commercial success
but it didn't really light the world on
fire
but now what eight years later um i just
recorded the audio version in my own
voice for the first time
the prior audio version was a voice
actor
and part of the theme of that book was
that i couldn't speak for a few years
i had a speaking problem so i didn't
record the audio book
and that's actually a theme that goes
through the book itself
in a meta kind of a way but now it's in
my voice because i can
and so that's available now anybody who
wants to hear that book in my voice but
here's here's my point on that
this morning there was a tweet thread
that went around
taking something from my book about how
to pursue happiness
that was just you know one part of the
book and turned into a
a summarized tweet thread
now do you know how many times that's
happened not just that part of the book
but different parts of the book people
are picking out
and summarizing and turning into tweet
threads in other words they're
they're taking the product and modifying
it and extending it
and it's happening a lot now
you may be less aware that there are
other best-selling books
other other fairly large
media things happening that are really
based on the book
it's either based on the systems versus
goals
part of the book which i think changed
the country
honestly and the talent stack part of
the book which i think changed education
now the number of people who know about
those two things
talent stacks and systems versus goals
it's really extensive at this point
it would be hard to find a an educated
person
let's say somebody works in the business
world or even academics i think
who were not aware of these aware of
those concepts
so give it a look if you haven't looked
at it and that's how you know you have
something when people are modifying it
um have you heard the story about nicole
hannah jones she was the author of the
1619 project
uh pulitzer prize-winning writer for the
new york times
and she was up for tenure at the
university of north carolina but after
uh i guess there was some probably some
complaints or pushback from
conservatives i'm guessing
uh and she was not approved for tenure
which apparently is unusual
and it was based on it looks like based
on her work on the 1619 project
i might be wrong about that but that
seems to be the implication
now the left is saying this is obviously
racism
and it's only the college caved because
there was too much
uh activity on the right you know
protest or whatever
and i think the right is saying
something like this
so how's that cancel culture thing
working out for you
just the way you hoped
i feel like every conservative is saying
something like that
out loud or in their minds so cancel
culture
got what got exactly what you wanted
didn't you
that the mob can fire you from your job
because the mob
doesn't like you even if your job and
your employer does
is that the world you want to live in
well that's the world you got
you you got exactly what you bought you
know if you pay for something and you
get exactly what you paid for
can you complain so i've told you before
that the
one way to destroy something you don't
like
is to adopt it fully
if you adopt fully a bad idea
then the badness of the idea becomes
more obvious it's only when you fight
against it
that it can stay there as strong as as
strong as it was originally
but the more you see people on the left
canceling themselves or get
in this case may be cancelled by the
activities of people on the right
you say to yourself is this the world
you want to live in
is it do you want to live in this world
where the mob
can decide if you get hired or fired
but that's our situation now
i i can't tell if this is healthy or not
it feels like it is
you know i it does feel unfair
to nicole hannah jones so let me say
that clearly
i think this is unfair because people
seem to be
quite united in saying that she's
qualified in general has done a lot of
good work highly educated successful
pulitzer prize winning you know she has
all the credentials
but the 1619 project was a little bit
controversial if i could say that a
little bit controversial
so should you get denied tenure
for the one thing you did that was
provocative
well if it's this provocative
maybe yes maybe yes
so we'll see where that goes uh the
funniest most ridiculous story of the
day
is lori lightfoot who's a
mayor in chicago has said that
she's only going to accept one-on-one
interviews from black or brown
journalists
because she noticed that there are way
too many white journalists
and so to even things out she'll only
take one-on-one interviews from black or
brown journalists
now a lot of you laughed at me
when i said i was starting to identify
as black
but here's the reason
you know you can't fault people
for using the rules if you're the one
who
came up with the rules right
it's the one who comes up with the rules
who has to be responsible
it's not the people who follow the rules
and the rules are
that you can identify as as what you
feel
closest to and i identify as black
i've given the reasons before i won't
repeat them today
but um and by the way i'm not joking
that i'm not joking it's it's available
to me
to identify as black and i prefer it
legitimately i prefer it because i have
experiences which are similar enough
and i have a sort of an affection for
that group
that i identify with i spend a lot of my
efforts and work trying to figure out
how to make the black community more
successful
so why not identify i have that right
so so i've decided to do it so
apparently
i would be able to get an interview with
lori lightfoot
now i do some writing on the topics of
politics and i wondered what would
happen if i asked for an interview and
just tell her i identify as black
what would happen would she
mock me for not being serious
because i feel less what the
conservatives get in trouble
for all the time mocking people for
identifying
in ways that other people don't feel are
legitimate
but that's not how it works it doesn't
really matter if
other people don't think it's legitimate
the whole point of it is you get to do
it yourself
if other people get to define me that's
a different set of rules
those are not the ones we play by so i'm
going to play by the real rules the ones
that actually are here which is you can
identify as the way you want
and if i asked her for an interview what
would she do but the
funniest the funniest response from this
was from kim klasik i think i'm
pronouncing that right
klasik who pointed out that laurie
lightfoot is
married to a white woman and uh
and kim klasik was wondering in a tweet
if
lori lightfoot still allows one-on-one
meetings with her own wife
or if she's trying to you know get a
little get a little fairness in there
so i i i think i laughed for 10 minutes
after i saw that
i couldn't even do anything i just kept
laughing and i would try to do something
else
and then i'd be laughing too hard and i
couldn't think and i'd be laughing again
i swear to god i left 10 minutes of that
here's a question for you i asked this
on twitter
with a little little twitter poll how
many
people think that uh california is doing
better than uh florida uh
let's say just in in terms of the covet
coving response death rate
and economics so we're going to look at
those two things death rate
not infection rate because the infection
rate has to do with how much you're
testing blah blah
but just look at the death rate
california versus florida
per thousand right or per million
whatever you have to do it as ratio
and look at the economics
so when i asked my followers that
question
what do you think they said 98 said
florida
is killing california florida is just
crushing it
and california and not doing so well
according to 98
of the people who follow me on twitter
and decided to answer that poll
very non-scientific does that sound
right to you
if you check the data would the data
confirm that
the florida is just crushing california
better on
death rate better on economics
nope no no
98 of the people who answered that poll
seem to be deeply uninformed yeah
they're pretty close
pretty close california is doing better
at the moment all right so if you look
at the history of it
you know the the the curves have been
reversing each other
but at the moment right now
this week california is doing better
than
florida in terms of specifically in
terms of death
death rate not just death because there
are twice as many people
in california so did you know that
did you know that the death rate in
california was lower
especially lately i'll bet you didn't
because this is that problem of uh of
the silos right
the the new silos i'll bet you didn't
know that
i didn't know it uh you know andres
beckhaus pointed it out to me uh this
morning on twitter and i didn't know it
i would have guessed the opposite
actually in fact i think i said the
opposite
i probably said the opposite in public
but what about the economy all right now
i know what you're saying you're saying
okay okay i get it
the death rates are maybe close to
comparable
and and as is being pointed out can you
really compare death rates
florida's got a lot of old people
california has a lot of
immigration which presumably is bringing
a lot of young people
can you compare them well i'll say that
if they're
in the same neighborhood
then you can't right if they're
generally close
then i don't think you can say anything
except other in the same
neighborhood which is what they are
they're actually in the same
neighborhood
so let's look at economics because if
one of them
you know crashed the economy to get that
same result that would be a mistake
right
how is the california economy compared
to the florida economy
i'll get to the point elle green how
does the california economy compare to
the florida economy
go in the comments tell me which one's
doing better
you don't know you don't know
i'll bet you don't how
right the the assumption that we all
made
before i brought this up or before you
you google it
probably your assumption was that
florida was doing better
right but turns out that california
had a 75 billion dollar
surplus in the budget
plus we got i don't know 26 billion
dollars from the federal government
california is a hundred billion dollars
ahead
during the pandemic
why well the reason is that rich people
were always taxed at a high rate in
california and rich people
didn't lose their jobs do you know who's
paying taxes
not poor people right yeah we have high
taxes
but that much surplus
certainly suggests that the economy did
all right
because the people who were out of work
got some kind of government and state
help
and seemed to be at least surviving it
i'm not hearing of people dying or
starving i'm not hearing the people not
getting
coveted health care that needed it i
don't know that california did poorly
and and if you think that if your
current thinking
is that florida just wiped the table
with california
i don't think the evidence suggests that
i don't think so
now i think there'll be a lot more
analysis of this
you'll have things such as number of
businesses that closed
i don't know how that matches up you
know per let's say per thousand or
whatever
um and there may be a whole bunch of
other things we can measure that have
not yet been measured
but at the moment i would say that
florida was more permissive california
was
less permissive in terms of opening up
but they got kind of a similar outcome
now if you got a similar outcome
but one took more of your freedom away
than the other
which one did a better job
yeah all right yeah if if they had a
similar outcome
but one of them took your freedom away
it's not even close
right it's not even close because we do
put enough value on freedom
and should that if you can get that
result without taking away people's
freedom you're the winner
i'm sorry it's not even close but
but don't be confused that florida is
just wiping the table in economics
and in death rate that's just not
happening
but freedom freedom freedom is a big
thing
maple bob says it suggests california
doesn't know how to manage its citizens
money
should be issuing rebates well it looks
like the governor is going to do just
that
the governor has said directly he thinks
the money could be better spent by the
people
but i think he'll end up being more like
coveted relief
than it will look like tax rebates
because i don't think anybody's feeling
sorry for the rich people who got richer
during the pandemic
nor should they all right
so uh are are you watching the uh
battle between geraldo and dan bongino
on usually on fox news uh i don't think
they like each other
i'm starting to get the feeling that if
dan bongino and
geraldo were in the same room i
could get tense in there so geraldo
is calling for a ceasefire in the
israel-palestinian
hamas situation there and dan bongino of
course is
you know more on the side of supporting
israel's right to defend itself
and here's the real question
we do know that innocent people are
being killed we know that children
are dying in this conflict whose fault
is it
so it sounds like geraldo would say it's
the united states fault
because we're giving weapons to israel
and supporting them
and that it would be the you know
israel's fault plus the united states
and dan bongino it looks like he would
argue
that hamas is bringing it upon
themselves
now i feel like this one's really
obvious you know there's lots of room
for
differences of opinions and lots of
things but
i i would like to turn this into the
poking the bear analogy
suppose you see a bear that doesn't seem
to be too aggressive you're you're out
taking a walk in the forest
and there's just a bear and the bear
looks at you but
isn't afraid of you and isn't going to
attack you and it's
it's just eating some bear food what
whatever bears eat
what do bears eat i don't know what they
eat but it's eating some bare food in
the forest
and you come across the bear and it
doesn't attack you and you
you take a stick off a tree you break
off a stick
and you walk over to the bear and you
poke it with a stick
and the bear goes what the hell
dude what the hell and then you take
your sticking it
poke it again and then the bear goes
you take your stick you poke it again
and then the bear just kills you
whose fault was it was it the bear's
fault
because the bear is a murderer and it's
certainly not
um i wouldn't say that the killing
somebody is equal to
poking them with a stick so
i think the bear overreacted so wouldn't
you say it was sort of the bear
murdered the stick guy right it's the
bear's fault isn't it
it's completely the bear's fault because
the bear did the murdering and that's
not even close to being
poked with a stick a few times
you see the problem here right i always
blame the guy who pokes the bear
i'm sorry i'm never going to change that
if you poke a bear
and the bear kills you it's your own
fault every time
somebody says false equivalence
well i think that fairness has nothing
to do with anything
this is just uh israel is just pursuing
its
strategic self-interest which they have
every right to do
every country does and strategically
what would be the good reason to stop
stop their military
attacks on hamas right now
ryan wants me to find some idiot to ban
just to make this more entertaining
um that could happen it could happen
ryan
so yeah give me one good reason that uh
strategically
all right now and
morally ethically
human-wise there are lots of good
reasons to stop
killing innocent people right from it
from a human perspective
if that's all you were looking at just
you know what's the most human thing to
do
stop killing people but of course it's a
complicated world
and nobody's killing anybody for fun
they're doing it because there
are great forces at work here
but what would be any reason that israel
should stop
let's talk about a few number one
is there odds is there a chance that
this will
escalate into a wider conflict
what about the abraham accords the other
arab countries that have
are or are likely to make peace with
israel
in more of a permanent and commercial
sense
do you think that they might withdraw
with
withdraw from the agreement and maybe
even participate in
fighting against israel do you think
that's going to happen
nope not without a lot of notice
uh don't you think that israel is having
continuous conversations
with the arab countries that are part of
the abraham accord or might be soon
don't you think they're talking to him
every day saying are you okay so far
you okay so far and probably they're
saying something like
really uncomfortable with this really
wish you would stop it
but i kind of see why you're doing it
and we like the abraham accords
i feel as if israel if they had
let's say private warnings from any of
the other arab countries
that they probably would have already
stopped
so whatever is happening with these
other arab countries it's
not affecting israel so i've got a
feeling they're either saying go ahead
or they're at least not complaining
so i don't see that as risk then there's
also a risk that it will extend
to let's say hezbollah
in lebanon getting more involved
now my understanding is that hezbollah
has a lot of rockets
as in hezbollah might have somewhere
between forty thousand
and a hundred thousand rockets some
rockets
have been coming out of that area toward
israel
but the reporting on that seems to be
that that's not hezbollah
it's rather people who are just
palestinian
supporters with what is called artisanal
rockets
hey scott i'm reading this comment just
lost my job in my
my apartment got any reasons to live
because this golden age hasn't gotten to
me yet
uh well you may have overpaid for that
comment
um i don't think you're in a bad
situation i don't know what state you're
in if you lost your job
in your apartment but everywhere that i
see there's
help wanted adds up i mean hiring is
great
so good luck for you but
there's a lot of jobs to be had i think
you'll be in good shape it's
jobs are not a problem right now
amazingly
all right so hamas let's say
if hezbollah gets involved in the
conflict between israel and hamas
it doesn't feel like they're itching to
do that does it
because if hezbollah wanted to get
involved in a big way
i feel like it would happen already
right like why would they wait
much longer before they did it i feel
like they would have been in there kind
of early
and it seems they obviously don't want
that
because hezbollah would be quite
degraded
by israel if they tried and it doesn't
look like it's gonna happen frankly
and i would also think that that would
put more pressure on iran it would kill
the
any kind of a nuclear deal iran wants
so i don't see hezbollah being a problem
at least without lots of warning i don't
see the other arab countries pulling out
of the abraham accords
again unless there's lots of warning and
then israel could just
stop if if the warnings were greater
than the benefit they were getting
so to me it doesn't make any sense that
israel would stop
which of course has nothing to do
with anybody's empathy about innocent
people
and children dying nobody wants that
we're all on the same side
nobody wants kids to die
but i think you just have to look at
this as a strategic decision by israel
and clearly the the right one clearly
the right decision
i think hamas is killing their own
children for political gain
and if you're dealing with a regime that
will kill its own children
effectively by by drawing fire in a
place their children are
um i don't know
how much empathy you can give them
because certainly you can have full
empathy for the children
but in terms of the country they're
allowing
they're allowing this situation to exist
and the people there
do have the power i mean if enough
people there wanted this to change they
could
so and this is not to say that the
palestinians have no
legitimate beef i think they do
let me say that clearly the palestinians
they got plenty to complain about right
it's not like they have nothing to
complain about
but i would personally feel quite
willing to
listen to all of their complaints if
they weren't doing it this way
you know if if the complaints were just
brought up as
a good argument and and they made the
case for it being some kind of
apartheid-like situation it's not
apartheid but
you know if it has any elements that you
could say look like that
i think i'd like to know about that
right i'd like to know more about that
i'd like to hear their argument but as
long as they're
essentially putting their own children
into a
death zone i just don't feel like i have
to listen to them
so that's bad persuasion on hamas part
good persuasion so far in israel's part
and the best thing that israel has going
for it
is that the the visuals work
best for israel
so i think we've all seen at this point
some photos
of casualties oh let me ask this
question
how many of you have seen uh in the
comments
how many of you have watched or either
video or seen
photos of horrible casualties
in uh gaza how many of you have seen
those photos shaun says none yet
uh lucky yes no nope i'll just read down
some
nope yup nope nope
not lately yes uh scene and stage so
many things are staged they might be
some of them
uh i have nope yes no no
no no no wow
[Laughter]
seriously that many of you who are
watching this podcast
live have not seen any photo or video
of casualties in gaza
wow and it's not that they don't exist
i literally was just looking at some you
know right before i got on
so there are a couple things going on
here one is that the media doesn't seem
to be focusing on it
but i've noticed that the media doesn't
focus on death and destruction
and victims nearly as much as it used to
can can anybody confirm that from your
own experience
does it seem to you that the media
doesn't show bloody bodies
nearly as much as they used to when i
was a kid is that true
and maybe that's just a decision they
don't want to turn off their customers
or something
but compare the the lack of attention to
the victims
to how many videos now let me ask this
how many of you in the comments
how many of you saw videos of the or
pictures
of the missiles coming into israel all
right now watch this
how many of you saw at least some video
or pictures
of the rocket attacks on on israel
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes yes i'm just reading the
comments
i did yes yes yes yes yes all yeses
so here's my point if i've told you a
million times
visual persuasion is the one that
matters
after fear fear is always your top
persuasion
but if you're if you're thousands of
miles away in another country
you don't have an immediate fear you
might be afraid for
friends or whatever in israel but it's
not an immediate personal fear
then the visual element is going to be
the most persuasive
in israel either by luck or design
i'm guessing design but it could be luck
has the visual advantage tons of
pictures of rockets being launched
which scares you if you look at that
many rockets being launched
into into a different city
do you have any way of not putting
yourself in the picture and imagining
living in a city where you look up and
there are
thousands of rockets maybe not at your
city but at your country
thousands of rockets coming your way as
civilian sites
thousands this isn't even close
the the visual advantage is israel's now
of course they also took out the ap
building
right in gaza did taking out the ap
building
reduced the number of photos of
casualties
i don't know but i'll bet it did
i'll bet there are fewer photos of
casualties because the ap building got
bombed
you know either directly or indirectly
maybe somebody doesn't want to take that
picture anymore
so don't poke the eagle
that's funny uh that was a comment
somebody said
all right uh let's look at uh
aoc so aoc apparently owns it's reported
how likely is this true
so let's let's see if this is true
because i got a feeling this one feels a
little bit too
on the nose too right but it could be
true
and it's a report that aoc owns a tesla
and parked it illegally in front of the
whole foods that's connected to her
luxury apartment building
now that's a little too on the nose
isn't it
but at least it's a tesla right maybe
two on the nose would have been a gas
guzzling suv
if she had an suv gas power that would
have been worse i suppose
but let's say it's true let's just work
through this
at the moment do we all remember that
when she got elected she complained
that she didn't even have enough money
to
get to washington and get an apartment
that that the amount that they pay them
to be a representative
really isn't enough to own a tesla
and have a luxury apartment is it
if your only financial uh if your only
finances are coming from
being a in congress as a representative
can you afford a tesla and to live in a
good neighborhood with a
whole foods attached to it because
my sense of economics is no
yeah my sense of economics is no that
you can't
so at what point do we ask
where her money comes from it's a fair
question isn't it
if you have an elected representative
who you knew was dirt poor two years ago
but today she's living in a luxury
apartment i don't know how luxury it is
really
it's probably not that luxury uh and she
has
i think a low end you know the low end
tesla
is there is there a question
somebody says she makes 200k a year and
it's
uh i don't know that that's enough is it
but it's a question so she may be living
a little bit above her means and have a
loan on the car
and making it work uh but i don't know
if she gets paid for speeches
if she got paid for her speeches she'd
be fine because you know two speeches
and she's doubled her income
yes that's what i thought 200 000 a year
is very small amounts
in some cities all right uh let's talk
about
uh systemic racism for a minute
so um did you know i
i only know this because i saw a tweet
from denisha merriweather
who is an organizer of
black minds matters black minds matter
here's a statistic that just blew me
away
just listen to this only
15 out of 100 black students
read on grade level 15
out of 100 can read at grade level
only 13 out of 100 black students do
math
on grade level 13.
only nine out of a hundred black
students
performed on grade level in civics
now this comes from the national
assessment of education progress
so apparently there's sort of a
dashboard of education
statistics so this is a credible
statistic
by the people who do these statistics
now
i knew it was bad we all knew it was bad
right
did you know it was this bad because i
didn't
i mean i i already thought it was the
biggest problem in the country
and i didn't know it was this bad i mean
i've
i've been talking about this and writing
about it and tweeting about it
and you know being active and and trying
to figure out how to
how to get more school choice primarily
to help poor people and in particular
black and brown people who don't have
the same advantages
and i had no idea it was this work this
bad and somebody's saying it's worse
in in some places yeah i mean
this is the average imagine how bad it
is in a bad place
this is the average the average
my god and
the fact that this is um i guess a
credible
set of statistics and this isn't our
biggest
issue in the country how is this not the
biggest thing we're talking about
do you so you know you wonder why i
identify as black
and why i talk about um the school
system and
the teachers unions in particular being
the source of systemic racism
thank you jeff
how is this not our biggest problem i
mean seriously
all of our other problems are big
but they seem to have enough energy that
people are working on them right
so you could argue okay but climate
change is a bigger problem
but i would argue that there's so much
energy working on it we'll
we'll figure that out but where is the
energy working on this
on this biggest problem huh
this is like low-hanging fruit it's the
it's the most
the most let's say solvable problem that
i've ever heard of
because it's not as if we don't know how
to make a good school
right we know how to make a good school
i'm pretty sure we know how
a parent can figure out how to send
their kid to that good school
the fact that we're failing on something
we know how to do
and is devastating the black community
for generations to come
is completely unconscionable and as
as offended as i have been by this
inequity for a long time i've never been
quite as offended as i am this morning
because i've never seen this
the statistics this stark
i mean it's it's crazy um
this should be our top our top thing you
know if
if we ever had a republican who just
gave these statistics
and said look here's the deal i know you
think i'm hitler
i'm just going to fix this president
president right let me say it again
a republican candidate for president who
just says you know i know we've got lots
of talk about racism systemic racism
it's all important but i'll tell you
what
i'm just going to fix this here here are
the statistics 15 out of 100 black
students
can't read on grade level i'm going to
fix that
you can argue all day long that i'm
hitler you can argue all day long
what's unfair what's fair you know who
has too many or not enough people
of what kind of color and what kind of
jobs you can argue that all day long
i don't give a
i'm only going to fix one thing just one
thing
it just happens to be the most important
thing
by ten to one and all the rest of you
you can argue about critical race theory
and systemic racism
and how many people work and everything
that's all you
just i'm just going to fix one thing
president
you couldn't lose with that message i
don't think
i mean you would have to be completely
defective in every other way to lose
with this message
here's a fun thing so i heard this from
twitter user greg sully who tweeted a
whole bunch of interesting things about
energy that i had never heard before now
some of them
you know may not come to fruition but
here's the
one that's the most fun he pointed to
greg pointed to a article about an
experiment conducted by this
scientist robert murray smith who took
the waste from cannabis the part you
don't smoke
you know the stalks and the stems and
stuff you don't want to put in your pipe
and he did some kind of science on it to
determine
that it could be a more efficient
battery
if you do the right processing with the
hemp
that the hemp cells are significantly
better than lithium
like way better like not even close
now it would take a long time to you
know
engineer it so you could actually be
sure that you could make a battery and
it would last and
didn't have some problems you didn't
anticipate and all that so it's nowhere
near a commercial
but it's out there is there anything
marijuana can't do
i'm starting to wonder so
imagine if you will and i i think he
only used hemp as an example it has more
to do with the fact that there are some
plants
in general that you could do this with
but um
what if this is true what if it's true
that you could make hemp batteries
that would be way better than normal
batteries that would change everything
now the thing with batteries
i'm saying brian says that the
statistics on
black education seems to be
damn it uh seems to be a
misinterpretation
but i don't quite understand the point
of that but just take that as a
a comment there might be some
misinterpretation of what that data
means
but i still think it's in the range
right i mean
directionally i don't think it's that
far off but
it's a good point what happens if
uh if battery storage keeps getting
better
now one of the things that sneaks up on
you is that if something is just sort of
improving every year your brain says oh
that's good
it'll be just like last year but a
little bit better
so you'll think oh my my cell phone and
my
my cell phone battery will last 20 hours
instead of 18
that's good and next year maybe 25 hours
yeah
batteries getting better but here's the
thing that sneaks up on you
at some point batteries are good enough
that everything changes and we're
we're creeping up to the everything
changes point
and by everything changes i mean
you just won't have gasoline-powered
cars it just won't make sense
but when i say everything i'm talking
also about
electric bikes i i know i talk too much
about my
electric bike but if you have not ridden
an electric bike you gotta you gotta
ride one at least around the parking lot
because i told you that the sales the
sales job when i bought my electric bike
i said hey i'm interested in electric
bike can i take a test ride
and the guy says yeah you just ride
around in the parking lot it was a big
parking lot so i take the bike
right around the parking lot for 40
seconds
i come back and i say i'll take it
and the guy laughs and he goes uh you
have the e-bike smile
and apparently everybody who takes the
e-bike into the parking lot
and tests it comes back with a smile on
their face that they can't get off and
says i'll take it
the things sell themselves you could not
you you could not try less to sell this
bike and still succeed i mean does that
make sense
you know they just sell themselves so
and where i live there there's an
explosion of them you see them
everywhere
so the changes you know how far you can
go on a bicycle completely
you know that you could not you would
not reasonably expect somebody
who doesn't want to be sweaty to ride a
bike to work
right because you ride a bike to work
you're all sweaty
you know maybe you you're wearing your
work clothes
but you could ride an e-bike 10 miles to
work
you wouldn't be sweating it'd be easy
but also
airplanes we're right at the edge
we're getting there i think just a few
more years maybe
less than three at which point you can
have an electric
uh battery-powered aircraft
and then it really gets fun because then
you've got
self-powered or self-navigating
electric powered personal aircraft
guaranteed if electric batteries just
keep
improving and we expect they will you
will have flying cars
and it's not very far away now the the
problem is the social part
of keeping them from crashing and you
put a parachute on them and
testing them and all that but technology
wise
we're we're right there we're right at
the point of
flying cars and that is really cool
all right i think i had a few more
things that i want to talk about here
but apparently i don't that looks like
everything i wanted to say
and what would happen also
if you could store electricity at your
house
and it was cheap because right now you
have the solar
batteries like a tesla battery and other
companies too
where you can put the battery on your
house um
charge it up with your your wind and
your
solar power and then you've got you know
enough electricity for the evening so
could it be that the improvement in
battery storage will make
uh nuclear energy
less essential because the big problem
with solar and wind
is that they're not all the time but if
you put a battery at your house
where you can suck up all the green
energy during the day
and then just unleash it at night
maybe maybe your need for
for nuclear power goes way down how big
a deal would that be
now i think we still need a robust
nuclear energy program
both domestic and nuclear both domestic
and military
because we're going to need it to um to
occupy space
i don't think you're going to do space
travel with the battery
but maybe maybe you can do space travel
with a battery what do i know
um
yes it will be a long time before
nuclear could ever become unnecessary
but you but you can see how that
crossover point
could happen and it could happen easily
in i don't know
20 years maybe maybe 20 years
uh how much power in an f-150 good point
so ford is
making their their f-150 most popular
truck i believe
uh electric and that's that's quite a
statement right there
um
you want nuclear windmills somebody says
all right oh let's talk about ufos
how did i forget that so i was watching
tucker carlson last night
and other people as well and apparently
the government
the government is now saying
unequivocally
that there have been ufo sightings
almost every day
in classified territory i guess
for the past year almost every day
now i'm going to stick with my
prediction
because i like to do that my prediction
is
that even though there's a ufo every
single day
or close to it
we're never going to confirm that
they're from another planet
so i'm going to stick with that now
will we confirm that there's something
happening that is an object
that has an earth origin
it looks it looks likely because if you
have
if you have it every day and people are
seeing it with their eyes
apparently and they're seeing it with
their uh their instruments
also i would say
there's a good chance there's something
out there but i would guess
uh drones and some combination of
you know optical illusions and stuff or
birds or something
would would if i believe that will
effectively be everything
um what is the risk of mass absorbing
wind and solar energy
absorbing it uh is there a risk from
absorbing too much energy from the sun
or from the wind i don't know that that
is a risk
i've never heard of that how much are
e-bikes
somebody else um too much
like fifteen hundred to four thousand
you know all kinds of ranges
um oh chris you like the new narration
and how to
how to fail thank you
um well just looking at a few yeah and
you have to wonder why the government
was denying it for so long
as someone said in the comments um
was the narration free don't know what
you mean by that
if you're talking about my my book
they do pay the person who does the
voice recording
so i got a you know a small check for
voice recording
um motorcycle is better than an e-bike
ah it depends what your
your application is i would say that the
e-bike
is as fun as a motorcycle and
can go a lot of places kevin says
aliens are our future self punching
through
time
what is more likely aliens coming or
some other dimension
or us going through time i don't think
it's going to be any of those
i think it's going to be an earthly
descriptions and someday we might know
do i use hypnotizing techniques in my
book
yes i do in the sense that good writing
is also good persuasion and persuasion
being a
you know the larger topic that hypnosis
is in
um dementia is more likely
all right special access programs i
think it's a trick
yeah i wouldn't believe that we're being
visited by aliens
but we'll find out and i will talk to
you
tomorrow
