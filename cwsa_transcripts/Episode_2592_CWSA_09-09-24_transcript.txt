well looks like the stock market's
up that's a good
beginning and we're going to have the
show that's
well better than anything you've ever
seen in your life probably
[Music]
probably good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and if you'd like to take
this experience up to levels that no one
can even understand with their tiny
shiny human brains all you need is a cup
or mug or a glass a tankered shell or
stand Stein a canteen jugar flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous zip and happens now
go
oh so good whoa are you feeling a little
extra this time I I feel like the
simultaneity of the world has gone to
new levels what could it be oh here's a
news story that explains it
all Starbucks is getting a new CEO
Brian
nickel and uh he's going to it says the
news says he's set to partake in a
ceremonial first sip of coffee this
morning I I feel like it happened at the
same time could you feel that I could
feel the will and spirit of every
Barista around the world simultaneously
sipping with CEO
nickel Brian
nickel you know I wish I had a nickel
for every time I needed to turn around a
coffee
company but I guess one one might be
enough well let's talk about science
because you know how much I love my
science a lot of you science deniers
yeah science
deniers you don't agree with me with my
love and appreciation of science but let
me tell you something there's a new
study that say that avoiding
positivity could be causing anxiety and
depression that's right if you avoid
positivity it could cause some
negativity
um Let me let me tell you how maybe this
group of scientific researchers could
have
saved a little time and a little bit of
money you could have asked me Scott we
thinking of doing this expensive study
to find out if avoiding
positivity might let some negativity
creep in to which I would say stop stop
what you're doing you don't need to
research that you could have just asked
me and then they'd say we just asked you
idiot and I say I know it's a good thing
you
did and the answer is yes a decrease in
positivity could have a negative impact
on your anxiety and your depression boom
saved you another
$200,000 but there's more science coming
according to fiku
do.com which is totally a real place uh
they they have a captivating Discovery
it's captivating damn it uh that uh
there was a two-year investigation and
they found out the husbands who kiss
their wives before they go to work live
a staggering five years longer if you
kiss your wife before you go to work
you'll you'll live five years
longer um in a related study if you kiss
somebody else's wife before you go to
work your life
expectancy is much less it's much less
yeah um but uh here here again here
again I don't want to get ahead of
myself but this might have been a place
they could have saved a little money
again
when they went to OA instead of spending
years studying it they could have said
Scott do you think that the people who
kiss their wives in the morning are
going to live longer and I would say
well what do we know about the people
who kiss their wives well not much they
just kiss their wives I go well what
could we understand just sort of presume
about that category of people well maybe
they have more attractive
wives okay you're getting there getting
close what kind of husbands do
attractive wives attract huh well rich
and is there any correlation between
wealth and Longevity yes there is a very
strong one huh is there anything else
you could say about attractive wives who
who husbands want to kiss before they go
to work well let's see probably the
husbands are more attractive too because
people tend to attract people who are
similar what would what do we know about
Attractive people well they're not
obese and that should make you live
longer and they might be more
symmetrical which is literally a tell
for good
health so yeah you could have saved
saved a little money just ask me are the
people who are willing to kiss their
wives before they go to work going to
live longer
absolutely in other news Sky News says
Elon Musk is on track to be the first
trillionaire maybe as soon as
2027 um but I'm going to add to this my
own opinion he's the only person I know
who has at least three paths to become a
trillionaire uh Tesla by itself could
make him a trillionaire you you have to
wait a little longer but it could get
there uh Tesla with robots you know if
you take the robot
component yeah yeah definitely
trillionaire I can even imagine SpaceX
being worth a trillion suppose they find
a way to mine one asteroid trillion
dollars right
there um and of course a moon Mars
colony Moon Colony those would be kind
of
valuable um and then
Ai and then a now ax is nowhere near a
trillion dollars but it's also nowhere
near built out what happens when he
builds it out what happens when he has
the best satellite communication Network
that's not
terrestrial he he's got maybe and that
would be if you only just CED the one
thing so his odds of being a
trillionaire if he stays alive for 10
years uh that's approaching
100% it's kind of
interesting well according to a
publication called
futurism uh some shady firms are trying
to figure out how to persuade chatbots
so chatbots are based on AI but uh
apparently you can influence them to
have a better or worse opinion of
products and people and that's no
surprise because the chat Bots are going
to search the Internet for whatever they
know so if there's more of something on
the internet they're going to pick that
up
um sorry wrong number all right so this
gives me uh a path for the future I've
already learned persuasion for human
beings now I have to learn persuasion
for
AI which apparently is just a a case of
repetition and
focus just like people
the way you Influence People is make
them look at one message more than
another and just make them focus on it
that's all it takes really what does it
take to make your large language model
AI change its opinion same thing you
just make a focus on or see more of a
competing opinion and that will think
well that's must be the average opinion
there's more of it so we'll we'll lean
in that direction so part of it is just
what you make it pay attention to but
but there might be something
deeper here's my question I see I see
yet another demonstration on the
internet of some Chinese company making
a robot that looks really amazing but
mostly it's the robot just you walking
and jumping and dancing and we've seen
quite a few robots jumping and dancing
and doing some simple isolated tasks but
here's my question I've spent a lot of
time on AI just using it as a
consumer I don't see anything in that
that could ever power a
robot has anybody had that same
realization so we're being told that
there's this inevitability we got this
AI That's getting better all the time
and we got these robot B batteries I'm
sorry robot
bodies plus robot batteries that are
much better so we're seeing these great
you know physical demonstrations of
robots but if the AI they put in the
robot is the same AI That's in my app on
my phone and I think it would
be it to me doesn't look like it could
ever be a
robot now yes it can talk to you but it
has so much hallucination and uh
variability to it that I don't know that
the current technology has a path to be
a robot breaker
we all assume that it'll just keep
getting better so whatever I'm looking
at now is misleading but I don't think
so I think we may have reached something
like the limit of what a large language
model could do and there's no other
model so I think that the AI for robots
is going to have to be some separate
field and what I think it will
be is separate databases for separate
skills so it's not going to be some
general AI it's going to have to be like
a special robot AI where you know
there's some module that taught how to
iron a shirt and there's another module
that teaches that this but it's not
going to be just generally smart yeah
it's not going to scour the internet and
know how to iron a
shirt
so I don't think it's really AI
basically I I think there'll be an AI
verbal part to your robot but that
they're programming below the the verbal
you know and I'm not sure we're even
good enough yet to program a robot that
you would have in your home let me put
it another
way I have a rule About Pets yeah we'll
talk about pets a little bit more I do
not want a pet in my home that if it
wanted to could kill me in a fair
fight so I've owned cats because they
can't beat me in a fair fight I've got a
smallish dog I could totally take her in
a fight I would not get a pair of uh
pitbulls to live in my home as my pet
because if anything went wrong they
could tear me to shreds before I could
you know get to a weapon
so I worry about
robots those robots look pretty strong
and pretty deadly and I worry about them
having some weird unpredictable Ai and
also the muscles to kill me while living
in my
house can you tell me for sure that
nobody can hack my robot and tell it to
kill me while I'm
sleeping you
cannot you cannot tell me that my robot
will never be hacked and somebody won't
tell it to kill me in my sleep you can't
be because everything can be
hacked and how hard it would it be to
change an instruction in a robot if you
could hack it it's a problem you you
think hacking is a problem already
because they can get to your banking
information wait till they can get into
your robot that's sitting next to you on
the couch that's a problem especially if
they're going to listen to all your
conversations you know you're going to
have a completely different
feeling about your digital device
recording your conversations which it
does versus a humanoid looking robot who
could remember everything you've ever
said and done and could report it back
to law enforcement
you don't think law enforcement will be
able to get a warrant to get your
robot I feel like we need some
legislation that says that law
enforcement can never access a robot
that that's a personal
robot right because you've got that with
relationships you know you can't force a
spouse to testify so they carve out this
special little legal protection I feel
like we need a law that says you can't
get into your you can't get into my
robot
because my robot will have a visual
record of everything I've
done you want that you want a visual
record of everything the robots ever
seen you do no you don't it might be
enough to not have one
actually all right um let see what else
is going on uh Tech Explorer says
there's a company that made a a robot
leg that's made of artificial
muscles so
uh developed by researchers at eth
Zurich and the max plank Institute for
intelligent systems so they made this
little uh a little model and they made
some artificial muscle and they used it
in the leg and it was a stronger and
better than the mechanical
ones now do you see the future humans
who are becoming more like cyborgs like
they'll get a chip in their head and
we've got our phones and we'll probably
have special glasses and stuff like that
so humans will become more robots but
robots are becoming more human so the
robots will get human muscles because I
do
think I do think the you know biological
muscles will probably be more efficient
if they can figure out how to how to do
it it seems like it' be better than the
mechanical ones so we're going to have a
world with robots that are organic and
organic people that are half robots and
it's going to get real
confusing can't wait for the mating
apple has a big announcement today um
they're going to introduce their new
line of products and this is exciting
people so the new new products that
apple is introducing is and uh this is a
complete
list okay next
story um no it's just all the same same
products we've got a phone for you
what's different it's a little bit
better what else you got well we've got
this uh new Apple watch all right cool
what what's better it's a little bit
better oh all right what about the iPad
oh we got that it's a little bit
better I don't know I feel like I'm not
being wowed
anymore but I'm also watching
Apple try to navigate the AI world and
they will have I guess it's not coming
today but soon they promised to add some
AI that will interact with all the apps
on the
phone
now why do you think it's not happening
and why do you think apple is not
investing in AI on its own to become
like a chat gbt
competitor I have a
hypothesis and the hypothesis is that
apple is not bullish on
AI meaning that they don't think that
the AI companies are going to get their
money back for what they
invest now I don't know that this is
pure speculation but it seems to me
given uh Apple's resources and talent
that if they thought AI as a field was
something that they just had to be you
know deeply into they would already be
doing it now maybe they're doing things
we don't know about that's also possible
but I feel like apple is lukewarm on AI
they know they have to build it into
their product because would make their
current product way better because right
now it barely understands English so if
the only thing that changed was it
understood what you were saying much
better and it could interact with the
other apps that would be really big you
know it would change completely my
experience of using my phone but it
would also make people talking to their
phone phones too
much if you had AI on your phone you'd
kind of want to talk to it all the time
as in hey open this app for me all right
uh send this
message why would you type when you can
just talk to it so you're going to have
you can have the most annoying world in
the world where everybody who has a
phone is talking to it even if they're
not on a phone call because it's just
easier to talk to it I do worry about
the world where everybody's talking to
their phone that's coming
well according to the Wall Street
Journal and lots of other people the Dei
programs are down now KS and mson are
backing away from Dei on top of
Harley-Davidson and Ford and John Deere
and a few others have backed away from
Dei so uh de is
down and uh there was a study of black
uh enrollment in colleges so Wall Street
journals looked at that and the share of
black students fell at several Elite
colleges and the the here's the uh the
post they put on X this is the Wall
Street Journal it said uh quote the
share of black students fell at several
Elite colleges this fall leaders of
those institutions are now trying to
figure out
why no they're
not they're not trying to figure out
why 100% of you know said you have to
stop discriminating against white and
Asian-American um
applicants no there's no mystery why it
went down they were literally forced by
the courts to stop a certain
segment of the public and when they
stopped white people and
asian-americans turns out that the mix
of people who were allowed in changed
now no Wall Street Journal nobody is
 confused about why it went down
there's no mystery here
whatsoever all right I'm not saying it's
good it would be great if if uh if uh if
admission were up but if it were up for
you know normal organic
reasons all right teen vaping is
down now this is weird it seems like
teenagers are being less addicted to all
the things
correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like
I've seen stories that say teen
teenagers are drinking less smoking are
they smoking less weed I'm not sure
about that one I think they're doing
fewer drugs in general now they're
vaping
less and they're also having way less
sex so is there one thing driving all
these
things makes you wonder if there's a
testosterone
do you think testosterone is part of it
if you have uh more testosterone at
least the boys are more likely to take
chances right and all these things are
chances you probably shouldn't take when
you're young but people
would so I also wonder if it's the uh
pleasure unit theory that I talk about
in which if you have alternative sources
of pleasure you don't have to see out
Dangerous Ones necessarily but if you
don't have any source of meure you're
going to find it wherever you can even
if it's illegal so it could be that the
you know the having permanently having
phones that can give you
dopamine maybe maybe it's just pumping
enough dopamine into teenagers that they
don't need
drugs it
just um yeah it just makes me wonder
like what's behind that I'm not sure
this is all good because you want your
teenagers to have a certain amount of
rebellion cooked into them because if
they don't have a certain amount of
rebellion they're not going to be good
citizens but uh I do worry if there's
too much too much happening there all
right the big story is Springfield Ohio
you all want to talk about it a bunch of
Haitian um migrants or immigrants have
been uh shipped into this town I guess
it was a town of only 60,000 people and
they got 20,000 Haitians now that should
be illegal
it should be way illegal to put 20,000
of anybody into a city that didn't ask
for it it wouldn't matter where they
came
from so I don't know how that's legal
they should be suing the government or
something but the big story is that the
Asian uh immigrants are reportedly
eating
cats as
in grabbing your house cat and skinning
it and eating it now here's my take on
this
this morning everybody wanted to talk
about this it was the number one thing
that got people's attention it's all we
wanted to talk
about I'm aware of one unconfirmed
report there's one one person who says
they saw their own cat you know strung
up and
skinned now that might be
true do you believe it how many of you
believe that there's a cat eating
problem in
Ohio well let me explain it further
let's say one of the biggest issues in
the campaign was that JD Vance said
there was a lot of single cat
ladies and then the other biggest theme
which there are probably two stories
about it just today headline stories is
that single
women are very much going toward Harris
and away from
Trump single women who owns cats a lot
of families own cats of course a lot of
single people of all types
cats is it a
coincidence that when single women who
own a lot of cats are the most
problematic group for Trump to get that
how
perfectly compatible it
is that suddenly the people that Trump
would like to deport are eating the cats
of oh let's say the single
woman oh there's only one thing you love
single woman the only thing in your life
is your cat and your your preferred
candidate is going to ship in the cat
eers I'm going to make a stand on this
one and say two on the
nose two on the nose so I'm going to say
it's
fake I would guess that sometime by
tonight you're going to see the left
leaning media say it's another hoax by
the people on the right uh there was one
unconfirmed report and they turned it
into a whole state of cat eating now I
don't know what
percentage of Haitian immigrants would
even be willing to eat a
cat I don't think it's that
high but I also say if you brought in a
bunch of people who didn't have access
to
food they're going to eat anything they
can
eat because that's just
human
so uh how many think that story is
real I'm going to say there might be
there might be one and there might be a
few I think the odds of it being a
widespread phenomenon are pretty low
pretty low
so let's put a pin in this one we'll put
a pin in it and we'll say it has it has
all the signals of being fake
news would you agree the signals are
very strong that it's fake news that
doesn't mean it is it it's within it's
within the realm of possibility I'm
going to
say if you put a gun to my head I would
bet against
it but I'm also open to it being
possible so I'm just going to put a pin
in it and say let's wait a little bit
longer let's see if those reports go
away or not I think they might go
away but what are the odds that uh KL
Harris is bringing in people to the
country that are going to grab people by
their
 I mean did the simulation just
really serve that up that the only
person who can help you is Trump if he
can grab your and keep it away
from the the Haitians there's something
about this this is just it's just too
perfect and then there's all these memes
of trump grabbing kittens and running
through running through groups of
Haitians who trying to eat him I've
seeing the memes going by now in the
comments on locals because they could do
pictures in their comments there there's
there's infinite
there's infinite scenes of trump uh
being kind to
cats now I've never heard whether he
likes cats or not he's never had any
connection to it but when you see a
million pictures of trump saving
kittens it might actually change
votes I don't think the left are seeing
any of these memes they're probably
limited to the right but but there's so
many of them and they're all hilarious
because they have kittens in them
there's something about Trump and cats
that's just a a wonderful connection an
unexpected you know pairing of things so
entertainment wise is really
good well according to
um James
O'Keefe um the uh Harris has flown
400,000 Venezuelans into the us and that
would represent at least in New York
City four 400 members of the Venezuelan
gang trenda
aroga do you think that we have 400 gang
members from the same violent gang that
are in one
city I feel like we might that doesn't
sound
impossible I'm not sure it's
confirmed but doesn't sound
impossible so we'll
see that's pretty
bad um there's more there's another
report about the Biden Afghanistan
withdrawal and apparently he did not
take advice from his many many military
advisers who told him not to do it the
way he's doing it take longer Etc uh
Biden apparently was fixated they say
and I think this is this might be a
political um political spin on this but
they say he was fixated on his his
legacy and making sure he got it done
before the 911 anniversary and that he
wasn't being driven by you know data and
safety and all the things he should have
been driven by he was driven by the pure
political level without any practicality
or planning to get it done I expect that
this is the sort of
story that I don't
100% trust the narrative because
remember everything's fake you know why
would this be the one thing that isn't
all right
um so we'll see
um there's another story that says uh
that apparently the US created some kind
of special Iraqi
bank system where they can move funds
around because once Iraq got you know
torn down by the the war um they didn't
have a banking system that worked I
guess so the US sort of overlaid one and
a lot of money has been going through
that banking system for years and now we
find out that it didn't have a
safeguards or money laundering controls
and that uh some immense amount of money
may have been funneled to terrorists in
in
Iran that's
right that's right we set up a really
efficient way to fund Iran's terrorist
Ambitions so the war in Iraq probably
a lot more secondary damage than we're
aware of so good job United States
literally every thing you touch
you destroyed destroyed Iraq destroyed
Afghanistan you have fixed
nothing Thomas Massie is opposed to the
uh new continuing resolution that would
be a short-term budget agreement that
would allow them to keep running up the
debt to ruinous
levels and uh not have to deal with any
tax cutting but uh so apparently so here
I thought that uh speaker Johnson did a
smart thing because he included in the
funding bill that the that the Democrats
would have to vote for the save act Sav
and the save Act was to make sure that
uh you were a citizen before you
voted now that seems like an obvious
thing everybody would agree with but
it's fairly obvious now that the
Democrats intend to cheat
and because there's no there's no
legitimate other reason that you would
be against election
Integrity it's not like there's a second
reason there's no second reason there's
one reason it's because you plan to
cheat so they're signaling it as hard as
they can so here's the wrinkle that I
did not know about and this is why
Thomas Massie continues to be a National
Treasure because he says the following
did you know this that if they approve
the six-month deal
that would of course they'd have to eat
the save act and they probably won't
approve it but if they approved it then
that would go into action and we'd pay
we'd keep the lights on but we'd be
running up our debt to ruinous levels
but did you know this according to
Thomas Massie if the speaker instead of
making it a six-year continuing
resolution which again is just a
short-term agreement not to agree on
anything about the budget basically just
to keep running up the debt
if you made that one year instead of six
months according to Massie uh there's
some kind of uh trigger that's already
built into law that if we get to April
with a continuing resolution that would
lead to a 1% automatic cut to
spending on April
30th hey now this is
interesting the it could be that the one
and the one only way we will ever cut
the budget
is if somebody sneaks in some kind of a
trigger that says if you keep behaving
badly and doing continuing resolutions
which are basically just not doing your
job right creating a
budget that the country could survive
would be called doing your job A
continuing resolution is an agreement by
both sides to not do their job and to
not create a budget which is survivable
let me say that again our current budget
is not
survivable like actually we're all going
to die I mean that literally
dead but you know we're we're pretty
good at changing things when it becomes
super emergency which is where we're
getting close to so I think we'll figure
it
out with you know massive pain but we'll
figure it out we're not going to
probably not going to starve to death
However the fact that our Congress
literally Doom
right in front of us hey um instead of
doing our job and cutting the budget I
think we'll do how about Doom do you
guys okay with doom Democrats Doom okay
with you they say yes yes we we have an
agreement on Doom that's literally
what's happening the people we elected
are voting for
Doom except for Thomas
Massie there's one
guy one guy
and uh so all all speaker Johnson has to
do is turn the six-month thing into a
one-year thing and it will trigger this
automatic 1% spending cut I think the
only way that our budget could ever be
cut is to put a 1% year per year
reduction in it and let inflation do the
rest and then you still have to grow
like a sorry about all this
wearing you you still have to grow like
crazy to even be survivable at this
point we could do it it's doable but the
you know the the window is getting
pretty narrow at this point you know the
opportunity for actual
survival is getting much smaller but I
think we'll do
it so yes I now completely opposed to
the continuing resolution now that I
know that extending it to one year would
get me that valuable 1% cut because you
know it's valuable about about cutting
everything
1% every single department will complain
that they can't operate no I need 10%
more if you cut me 1% I'm 11% away from
being able to do my basic job but then
they'll do it they'll figure it
out it it's sort of like Elon Musk
cutting 80% of the staff of uh Twitter
it doesn't make sense on paper and
everybody complained and said it
wouldn't work seems to be working fine
and a 1% cut across the board same thing
everybody would say it's the end of the
world and a year later everything would
be fine so it is the one and only way to
do it because you don't have to vote on
specific things being
cut so it's the only thing you'll ever
get anybody to agree on is how about a
little bit 1% per year just 1% across
the board it's the only thing that'll
ever
work well Trump came out in favor of I'm
going to characterize it as
decriminalizing
marijuana um but uh he's Florida has a
Amendment Three coming up for a vote
that would apparently decriminalize
marijuana to some extent I don't know
the exact details but Trump came out in
favor of it so one of the advantages the
Harris had was this decriminalizing
marijuana or at least you think
Democrats are going to do that but here
it is Trump is on board with the
populist
um I guess a populist opinion on this
it's a popular
thing I would like to uh
reiterate that I don't recommend
marijuana for
anybody in case you case You' never
heard me say that I do think there are
some special cases and I might be one of
them where if I don't have to commute to
work and you know I've got a medical
benefit from it which is tremendous that
you know a special case but no I don't
recommend it so listen to the people who
tell you not to do
it they're giving you better
advice but personally I would never move
to a state that uh had illegal weed so
this would put uh Florida in play for
me th this was the one of the two things
I was waiting for and Florida uh Texas
is still and of Texas is not on my list
because of because of weed being illegal
there um you know that Trump suggested a
sovereign wealth fund and uh Mark cubin
weighed in and said that is
stupid um you don't do a sovereign
wealth fund which would be like an
investment fund for the country to do
really big projects He said you don't do
that if you're running a a debt now I
understand the debt point but it turns
out that we learned today that according
to Bloomberg
that the Biden Administration has been
working on a proposal to create a
sovereign wealth
fund so poor Mark Cuban he's out there
trying to do the best he can defending
some of the worst ideas in the world and
he decides to go hard at The Sovereign
wealth fund because it's
Trump and at the same time Biden's
working on the same plan his argument
that you don't do as uh you don't create
a investment fund if you have an
emergency in your debt situ ation that
makes sense but uh if the Sovereign
wealth fund wasn't going to make a dent
whatsoever in the if it wasn't enough to
make any dent in the debt but it might
have some big strategic benefits there's
an argument for it maybe there's a
better way to handle the
debt uh speaking of Mark
Cuban we learned today that he's not a
donator to politics I like that I like
the fact that he's not doesn't have a
record of donating to Democrats or
Republicans I I respect that actually um
but if you see him online he appears to
be trying to
exhaust Trump supporters with endless um
biased questions which he's fooling
people into responding
to he he's creating this this infinite
amount of wasted energy by pushing
people to support Trump's various
policies
so the questions will be you know kind
of kind of good but academic trolling
kind of questions where to answer the
question you'd have to put in a lot of
work but if you don't answer the
question it looks like you can't answer
the question so it's a bad policy so
it's total troll Behavior I mean I I
wouldn't characterize it as anything but
trolling but he's really good at it he
is really good at trolling so he's
getting a lot of prominent people to
spend a lot of time responding to his
questions which honestly are dumb
questions they're just troll questions
in my opinion and what I mean by that is
that they're
brilliant because if you looked at the
paper or if you looked at his
questions about Trump uh on the surface
you'd say huh that's actually a good
question I sort of like to know the
answer to that myself but if you see how
many of them he's asking you can tell
it's more of a strategy than any
curiosity so uh don't let him suck up
all your energy so my my only caution is
he's not moving the needle you know it's
not like the Democrats are looking at
him and say Mark Cuban's got some good
ideas I think I'll vote for Biden or
sorry vote for Harris um I think he's
just draining the energy and of
Republicans so they don't have energy
for other stuff I don't know what he's
doing but it looks like pure trolling to
me that's my
take well Morning Joe is trying to turn
uh Trump's statement that he would go
hard against election cheaters should he
get elected as more evidence of his
dictatorship he is totally a dictator
because he uh he wants to jail his
opponents they call it now Trump says if
you cheat in the election as in break
the
law that the law will be you know used
to its
maximum uh impact to put you in jail now
was there a part of that where Trump
said even if you don't break any laws
we're going to put you in jail because
we don't like you because you're my
critic I don't remember that I don't
remember that and of course we've seen
January 6 where people were put in jail
for much
less and
so um but they're doing a good job so
they had a guest on there that uh uh
it's creates a dangerous situation for
Trump to say he's going to deport a
bunch of uh illegals and that could
cause some violence and that he would be
election he would be arresting these
alleged election cheaters if any of them
exist and that those are too dangerous
and
totalitarian do you know how hard you
have to work to make it a bad
idea to deport Venezuelan
gangs because obviously he's going to do
the Violet ones
first don't you think let let me give
you a
prediction number one is Trump serious
about deporting whatever it would be 20
million
people I'm going to say
yes I'm going to say yes if if he could
snap his fingers and they would just all
disappear back to their home country you
know safely and well fed and everything
I think he would do it if he could just
snap his fingers and they all leave and
you know they're still alive and they're
happy and they're fat and everything
they're just back in their original
country yes so yes he's serious he wants
every single 20 million or whatever the
number is to be gone tomorrow if he
could do it but should he get elected he
will be part of the real world you
remember the first time he got elected
he said he would
Deport 25 million people but as soon as
he got elected he was like well you know
what if we just tighten up the
Border we'll be
fine and honestly most people sort of
got okay with that even the ones who are
you got to deport everybody now they
just sort of got over it it wasn't
really a big
deal so what do you what do you predict
if Trump gets elected again
well here's my
prediction any deportation would be
prioritized by deporting the dangerous
people first that is such a big job that
it should take all of their resources
for
years because so many so many gang
members Etc have been let in I mean it
would take forever just to get the bad
ones now let's say a few years are going
by and they're deporting as fast as they
can but really they're starting with the
the
criminals so now let's say you you
succeed let's say three three years in
you've really gotten rid of most of the
criminals but you've also tightened up
the border so there's not much coming in
so now if you Deport somebody after
three years hypothetically it would be
somebody who's probably
working and adding to the
economy and not a
criminal and it's three years in and he
doesn't have to run for election again
is is that guy getting
deported would you want want to make a
bet on
it I'll bet you that in three years
somebody who's been working for a few
years and not breaking any laws probably
won't be deported now there might be
some limitation on becoming a
citizen I could see that happening
but you know we don't need to solve a
problem that's sort of solved itself
and the fact is that the United States
is really really good at
assimilating spanishs speaking
neighbors you know there was a time when
you probably wondered can we do that you
know is is are the cultures too
different and all that and there is a
challenge I mean it's a big challenge
but it is the most successful
non-english-speaking
well no let me take that back there have
been quite a few groups that totally
successful in integrating
asian-americans totally successful um
black Americans did it the hard way but
completely successful of
course anyway that's what I think I
think you'll get rid of the worst
criminals and at some point uh the
country will be like you know that's
fine you know my neighbor who been there
for two years he's a good guy I think
it'll just turn into
that meanwhile there's something called
the BB files and then there's a uh I
guess it's a documentary coming out
that's going to allegedly show that
Netanyahu of Israel had a bunch of
bribery corruption related
allegations here's what I need to tell
you about
that it's a
documentary don't trust any
documentaries this is this is what I
call y documentary effect now it doesn't
mean it's untrue I don't know one way or
the other I don't have any special
information I'm just saying that if
something looks really really true
because you saw it on a
documentary you're going to have to
learn to force your brain to reduce the
credibility of that to
zero a really really convincing
documentary that proves to your brain
beyond a shadow of a doubt these
allegations must be true because I can't
even imagine imagine how all these
accounts could be
fake but I will tell you if it's a
documentary you would be convinced that
convinced whether whether the
allegations were true or false so being
completely convinced by a documentary
that's full of credi looking people your
brain should adjust that to
zero there's no evidentiary value and if
you don't believe me I always recom
commend this little test watch the
documentaries that accuse Michael
Jackson of horrendous crimes and then
watch immediately after Watch the
documentary that says all the crimes
were made up and it's
fake they are equally persuasive and
they opposites if you would only watch
one you would absolutely Come Away with
the belief that that one was there's no
way this is wrong I mean it's just so
well documented and proof and you got
witnesses and I you see all the parts
everything's transparent it's obviously
fake and then you watch the opposite and
you think oh my God he's a monster I
actually don't know what's true having
watched both documentaries I no longer
have an opinion on Michael Jackson's
innocence or guilt I've actually had to
remove my opinion I just treat it like
uh innocent till proven guilty and I
don't believe he
was doesn't mean he's
innocent but I'm not going to I'm not
going to treat him as a presumptively
guilty person because the only evidence
that I've seen is the least credible
kind documentaries and people making
claims and people who had money money
writing on it and that sort of thing so
again I'm not defending
him because because I know this is where
you follow into a trap it sounds like
well Scott you're you're kind of
Defending somebody of terrible crimes no
I'm not I'm I'm offending documentaries
I'm not defending anybody I'm
aggressively saying documentaries are
 if you want to know the
truth anyway there's a story about a a
California state
Senator a woman who allegedly was
forcing her former male staffer to do
perform oral sex on her uh whenever they
went on business trips
and he was not a big fan of this but he
went along with it but eventually um he
was performing such act allegedly in a
car and uh and he had uh an
injury so on it says this is the New
York the New York Post on their final
encounter uh K alleges so this is the
the senior staffer who is doing
performing the oral section on his boss
said cond alleges he suffered a
debilitating back and injury back injury
while performing oral sex on the senator
in a car leaving him with three
herniated discs and a collapsed
hip
now this raises many
questions
um I once uh spent 10 minutes looking at
something called I don't know if you've
heard of it it's called pornography has
anybody heard of that
it's a it shows people doing sexual
things on video and apparently it's all
over the Internet so I spent 10 minutes
looking at it once and uh that's all I
needed 10 minutes and I'm out I mean you
know once I got my fill I was like whoa
I'll never have to look at it again I I
got an idea what this is all about so
I've watched it and I've watched videos
in which there were men performing this
very
act and correct me if I'm wrong I felt
like some parts of
their mouth and tongue might have been
moving some some business with the hands
perhaps but I've never really gotten my
back too involved in such a thing and
when I watch the
pornography I'm not sure how to
pronounce that but um I never see them
get their back
involved is there a way to do it that
that I'm not aware
of in know in other words should you be
undulating sort of like a you know how a
a porpus swims you know that they're
just sort of moving their back like is
it sort of like that where you know no
matter what you're doing with your
facial part your are you also lunging
sort of like that I mean I'm no expert
but doesn't seem like that would be
additive anyway um I don't believe
anything about this story
it could be true but I don't believe
this story I'm sorry nope I'm not going
to believe the senior the back injury
from performing oral sex
sorry sorry not buying
it well um Trump allegedly according to
Bloomberg said he would put a 100%
tariff on countries that shun the US
dollar so that would be countries like
China in
India Russia I guess I don't think we
import a lot of Russia stuff
um is that a good idea or a bad
idea here's what I think if if if what
he means is uh every country that has
that's trying to shun the dollar which
is a growing number of countries that
that they'll have a
100%
um tariff
I don't think that could be a good idea
in any world but let let me remind you
who's doing the talking here this is
Trump what he needs to do is make people
think he might do
it that's the game the game is not
whether he does it the last thing he
want the last thing he wants to do is is
do this he just has to make it look to
other people like it's the first thing
he wants to
do if they believe he might do this
they're going to put a percentage
likelihood on it and they'd be like
H let's see I don't think he'll do this
but there's a 20% chance he
will can we take a 20%
chance that he'll do this it's a
negotiating
position is there a chance you'll do
this
probably probably does it look like a
good idea no no not to me it it looks
too extreme but if you're negotiating
doesn't look too too extreme at all let
me say this more clearly if you're
negotiating which is what this is when
you say publicly if you do this we're
going to do this that's negotiating he's
just doing it in advance so that should
he get an office half of his work is
done well you you heard me talk for the
last year what I was going to do to you
guys if you shun the dollar so what's it
look like you gonna shun the dollar oh
you are oh you are after everything I
said what I would do okay game on 100%
tariff so yeah if you see it as
negotiating
negotiating it's perfect if you assume
that it literally is what he's going to
do on day one to everybody who shuns the
dollar well that's not
ideal there will be a big presidential
debate
tomorrow uh question given that it's
going to be broadcast on all the
networks I believe so ABC will host it
but everybody has rights to broadcast it
because it's a public good I can stream
that
right there there's nothing would
prevent me from streaming it on the
platforms can you confirm that H so in
other words I can do my show but behind
me can be the debate that I'm watching
because it's Public public
domain I I want to make sure I'm not
violating anybody's IP rights
accidentally because I'm I'm not the guy
who should be doing that I mean if your
whole if your whole business in my case
is based on intellectual property you
you don't want to be like the big
 about
it I I feel like I want to stay legal
and appropriate you know not just legal
Beyond legal I want to do what
is
ethical so that's more than
legal so I think I think that's okay
though right because it's a public good
all right I'm going to proceed on that
assumption there is according to the
amuse account on X which is a great
account you should be following
amuse
um there's some uh leaks from the uh
preparation for Kam Harris for the
debates and uh they're saying that they
they're trying to get her to act more
like a prosecutor so that she can frame
the situation as like she's a prosecutor
and Trump's a criminal and she's just
Prosecuting things now my take on that
is do they not know how bad an idea that
is
because let me make a list of the things
that I would least like to
hear the thing I would least like to
hear is a bunch of lawfare sounding
prosecutor talk from a potential
president that's the last thing I want
to hear so if she thinks that that's a
good
look I would ask her to
whom now I'm not going to be the one who
says uh that Trump will be more popular
with black voters because he has a mug
shot and he had legal
problems no I'm joking I am going to say
that Trump probably is going to be more
popular to Black voters because he has
legal
problems because everybody can relate to
legal problems everybody can relate to
being unfairly treated so I don't think
it's just the black community so I'm not
going to say that you know extra special
way the black community loves criminals
I don't think that's the case but I
think everybody sees what's happening
and sees him as a victim of lawfare but
they also put themselves in his position
if you watch somebody being you
railroaded by the legal system I don't
know about you maybe I'm too close to it
so I'm different but I immediately
translate that into my own experience
and I say wait a minute if they can do
that to
him how hard is it to for them to do it
to you and
me so to me this would be the number one
worst
approach if she comes off as a
prosecutor and then Morning Joe starts
praising her for acting like a
prosecutor she
loses that you
lose you I don't even think you can
recover from that that that would be the
end of the campaign in my opinion now
I'm not sure that this report is true
because if I were as clever as the um
the people are who seem to be advising
Comm haris here's what I'd do I would do
a fake leak and say that she's planing
to be a prosecutor so that Trump would
prepare for
that but I would be advising her don't
be a prosecutor nobody wants to see that
be a leader does a leader sound like a
prosecutor never nope nope you can't
make the prosecutor sound like a leader
you cannot do that those are just two
different so I think there's a strong
chance this is a fake
leak meaning that they wanted Trump to
think he should prepare for this
prosecutor personality and it won't show
up so but it could so I'm not going to
rule it down completely uh I'm simply
introducing the idea that her current
advisors are definitely smart enough to
plant a fake
leak that that is well within their
brain capability and you know their
method of work so just be careful that
one I'd love to see her do it though
because it would be the end of
her um there's a story also from the
amuse account that apparently the Biden
Administration bribed Mexico with $20
billion to help shut down the Border
because the election is coming and they
did now the background of that is that
Mexico said we'd love to help you you
know securing the Border but we don't
have the money to do it so the US said
well it's a board to us so we'll give
you the money and then they got the
money and then they did it now that's
the official story here's my version of
it of course we could do it anytime we
want we did it under
jump but we're not going to do it this
time unless you give us $20 billion that
we can spend any way we want all right
here's your
check
so it's also hard to ignore that $20
billion is exactly the cost of the
entire
wall correct me if I'm wrong but that's
exactly the number that people estimated
that the wall would cost right so now we
just wrote a check to Mexico to buy
literally nothing literally nothing
because they would have done it for free
for
Trump I'm pretty because they did before
so I think they would again you know
Trump would just threaten them instead
of bribing them instead of saying we'll
give you 20 billion he'd say we'll take
20
billion and then they would just do it
on their own so when you look at the
difference in negotiating and capability
there's a mile of difference that the
Democrats just don't have the
goods all right ladies and gentlemen if
you haven't heard
already the 2025 dilber calendar is now
available for pre-sale but only at go to
the dilber
and you'll see the sales link get more
than one and the shipping costs will
seem far more reasonable and everybody
you know wants one for a gift somebody
asked me on the site um they said we
used to buy multiple copies to give to
our
customers but we now that you have the
Dilbert reborn we're worried that maybe
this isn't good to as a giveaway to
customers let me assure you it's not
good as a give giveaway to your
customers
I'd love to tell you that that was safe
but we don't live in a safe world yeah
is it safe for you to buy one and put it
on your desk you're going to have to
decide that on your own now there's
nothing in there that's more than
PG 13 right it's it's not profane that
way and the issues that it touches on it
does it in a comic way not a in yourface
way so although I do deal with you know
Dei and um all of that stuff I don't do
it in a way that I would be ashamed of
at any time in my life so so I do handle
it in the comic way not in
the I don't know the provocative way I
guess um in my opinion a ordinary person
would not be offended by anything in the
calendar but could somebody who didn't
like you use it as an
excuse they might so you be the
judge um decide how much you want it
displayed and whether you want it at
your home office or in the real office
but I wouldn't buy 20 copies for your
customers uh honestly I mean I'd love
you to buy it but I wouldn't do it I I
would buy it for individual use and then
even then I'd use your judgment but home
office
Perfect all right that's all I got for
now now I'm going to say bye to X and
YouTube and Rumble and I'm going to talk
to the local
subscribers or the most special people
in the world so that'll happen in 30
seconds
well
