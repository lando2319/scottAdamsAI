hey everybody come on in come on in
yes it's time for coffee with scott
adams
and what what is it about coffee with
scott adams that's different
from the rest of your day that's right
it's better it's better than all the
rest of your day it's the best part of
the day and all you need is a copper mug
of glass a tank of chelsea stein canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes
everything better
are you ready watch this go
does not disappoint not once
all right well
i would like to declare that things are
going okay
that's it
things are going pretty well
how do you know
because we can't stop talking about
harry and megan
let me tell you
if there's one way to know
that the world is heading in the right
direction finally
is when the biggest thing you have to
talk about is
harry and
megan
do you mind if i
throw a little bit of extra
provocation into the mix
correct me if i'm wrong but isn't there
some question as to whether harry is
actually related to the royal line
i mean
he's related to his mother
but is harry actually related to the
queen and if he's not would his son be
related and do we know that
just ask him
because
[Laughter]
somebody says
somebody from great britain doesn't like
this conversation at all
somebody says don't go there don't go
there
well here's the thing
if the royal
the royal succession is supposed to be
by bloodline
wouldn't this be a coup
i mean wouldn't it
if archie ever became the the king
wouldn't they have basically just taken
over the
it over the bloodline it'd be a whole
new bloodline
am i wrong
i mean i haven't seen his dna test i'm
just wondering
you know i'm i'm not the one who made
the rule
that bloodline is what determines
who gets what i didn't make that rule
i'm just saying if that is the rule
we have the technology to check that
bloodline now and
i'd just be interested
i'd be a little bit interested to see if
he's part of it
so i'll just throw that in the mix just
to get things mixed up a little bit
so
how are you having this same feeling i
went out yesterday and i was just i
decided to just go out and take a drive
and just see what things look like
now that we're getting a little bit back
to normal and i gotta tell you
yesterday felt pretty normal i mean
people had masks on indoors
but most things were open that are still
in business a lot of stuff
won't come back but the things that are
in business they seem pretty open and
uh travel is happening you know people
are traveling
so
psychologically
see if you're with me on this
psychologically but not physically
i feel like the pandemic's over
do you feel that
just psychologically obviously there's
still restrictions in place
obviously people will still die
obviously it's still a problem you got
to get vaccinated so all those real
things are there but
psychologically
doesn't it feel over
it does doesn't it
because at this point i put on my mask
not because i'm afraid
but i'm just going through the emotions
at this point
because the difference between being i
don't know one-third vaccinated
versus being you know nearly a hundred
percent protected
we're almost there because if you get
all the
if you get all the people who are
vulnerable vaccinated
we're kind of done
because as soon as the vulnerable are
vaccinated
the size the problem shrinks down to
the size of our other problems
and we we don't need to make it go to
zero it just needs to be about the same
size as our other problems and then we
can go on
i feel like we're there
i mean not really a few more weeks
but psychologically where are you now
compared to just months ago it's really
different isn't it
am i wrong it feels completely different
just in the last week or so
um oh somebody says they got the vaccine
and then got coronavirus well
uh that sucks
now for on on my end i'm actually going
to be socially distancing a little bit
harder than normal
i mean i'm going to try even harder
because it wouldn't make sense to get
the coronavirus now
you know so close to the vaccination
you know i feel like i'm in the next
wave in california probably the next
wave guess me
so i'm going to play a pretty safe until
then
all right
here's a question
so you probably heard the story that one
of joe biden's german shepherds in the
white house apparently bit somebody and
so they relocated it back to delaware to
his home
and
here's a question i ask
if
trump had been in the white house and
had two german shepherds
would the news have just
just ignored that choice of breed
do you think that that trump could have
owned two german shepherds
and and that would have been fine nobody
would have mentioned it hey good doggy
good doggy
no
no i don't think that trump could have
owned german shepherds
or dobermans
he could have owned a fluffy dog or
something that it's probably not his
personality but
he couldn't have gotten away with even
owning those dogs and you know that's
true right because it wouldn't look like
hitler or with his attack dogs
but what would have happened if trump
owned two german shepherds and one of
them bit somebody
if one of those dogs bissed somebody in
the trump administration
how long would it be before we found out
the
uh the ethnicity and gender of who got
bitten
right
right
we would know the ethnicity of who got
bitten by now
because then that would turn into a
whole story about even his dog is racist
you know that would have happened
so yesterday there's another biden gaffe
where he couldn't remember what was that
he couldn't remember the name of his
secretary of defense he couldn't
remember the name of the pentagon
it was pretty bad
and he just got up there and muttered
and
wandered away
and
once again i must ask this provocative
question
how much
does the press know
about what's happening behind closed
doors
with biden
that they're not telling us
do you really think
that when biden goes from his public
performances which are frankly
embarrassing
do you think that as soon as he gets off
camera
he comes alive
and he's completely lucid
it's only when the camera is running
that he falls apart
what do you think
does that seem
likely
no
it's far more likely
than if anything he performs better for
the camera because he you know had to
get up for it right he made sure that he
didn't go out there until he was at
least feeling right
but how bad is he when he's not trying
to get up for something
and nobody's reporting on
this now you could argue that there's a
national security reason to not report
on it
but would that stop anybody
do you think that do you think our news
would say oh we better not tell
russia and china how bad he is behind
closed doors because then they might
attack her or something
i don't think they're going to attack
but
when you
when you hold in your head
how aggressively
dishonest the press is
to keep this from the public you know
there are stories
come on you know that they're stories
and we're going to hear them after
biden's out of office
and you're going to be
really mad
you're going to be really mad when you
find out what the press knew
and didn't tell you
here's a mystery for you i put this on
twitter people have lots of theories
let's see what you think
why is it that um
was it let's say for the people who
believe that masks and social distancing
don't make a difference
why is it that the normal seasonal flu
the regular influenza we get every year
why did that drop to zero
sort of everywhere
not just in the united states but
worldwide
it just sort of disappeared
now
is your argument that the for the
regular influenza if you believe the
mass and distancing don't make a
difference for coronavirus
do you believe that the explanation
the explanation is that
masks only work for regular flu
but they don't work for coronavirus
because it is suggested
that the regular flu may be more about
surfaces things you touch
whereas the coronavirus the
the virus is more aerosol than airborne
but the coronavirus is heavier i just
read than say measles or chicken pox so
viruses do have different weights
so that's that's a real thing some
viruses
stay in the air and
some don't
now what is the function of a mask
isn't the function of a mask
to stop it before at least stop some of
it before it gets out there now if the
virus is on the water particles and the
water particles hit the mask
you would think that they'd stay some of
them would stay in the mask
but
this mystery remains now some people
said
it's because everybody with the regular
flu is being diagnosed as having
coronavirus
do you believe that do you believe that
everybody who had a regular flu is
getting misdiagnosed as having
coronavirus
now that might have happened
early on
but at this point if you have symptoms
of either flu
don't you get tested every time
can somebody do a fact check on that if
you're in the united states
and you go to a doctor
because you've got flu symptoms of any
kind
won't they test you for coronavirus
every time now
they couldn't do it in the beginning but
now they'll test you every time right
right
so there shouldn't be any any doubt
today about whether somebody has
corroded virus at least now somebody
said well what if they have both
coronavirus
and the regular flu
we would we would treat those as
coronavirus well we probably would
but how many of them are there
how many people have coronavirus
and the seasonal flu at the same time
i mean
maybe some but that's not enough to
change what we're seeing right our
observation can't be explained by that
little bit of overlap
other people say that the coronavirus is
uh not nearly as big as you think
because the way we test it we're picking
up fragments or whatever i don't think
any of that's true by the way
now i haven't looked into it but
uh it does seem to me that
that we're at least picking up that
somebody had coronavirus all right
so it doesn't mean that you're
necessarily gonna have symptoms
so
um
i would say that this remains a mystery
and and however this mystery is solved
we're going to learn something that we
thought was true
is not true
we're either going to learn that the
regular seasonal flu was never real
like it just wasn't real
was that possible because all of the
explanations sound a little bit
impossible
so it's going to be something that
doesn't sound possible
so it's either that we've always
miscounted the regular flu and i'm kind
of a
proponent of the fact that we miscounted
the deaths
from the seasonal flu regular flu
or the or that we test it wrong or that
masks only work for one kind of thing
but not the other
possible
it's possible
but i would say it's still a pretty
mystery wouldn't you how did we get all
the way to here
and we don't know how to explain that
it feels like there's something really
big
that we don't understand
now i've been seeing on social media
a couple things one is that
the cdc and somebody do a fact check on
this the cdc did a study and now they're
saying that the uh
masks uh i think they're talking about
mass or maybe social distancing only
made i think masks only made like a less
than one percent difference
do you think that could be studied
do you think somebody can tell you if
masks worked or didn't work
is that possible to study that
how
how would you possibly study that
where is the place
that had both masks and no masks at the
same time
because if you don't have that you don't
have anything there are no two places
that are the same
and there's no way to know why the curve
did what the curve did too many
variables
you you could certainly observe okay we
put in masks and things got better or
they got worse and you could compare it
to other places
but that wouldn't tell you anything
right there's no control group
so
the best they could do is sort of a
non-randomized controlled
thing where maybe they did a meta study
of combining things would you trust that
would you trust a meta study some kind
of a study of studies where none of them
are randomized controlled trials none of
them are
but if you add them together
they'll tell you something now that is a
thing
there are times when you can actually
get to truth by doing exactly that
adding together the studies and that you
know you hope that they cancel out
whatever they did wrong if they didn't
all make the same mistake you hope it
cancels out so it's a real thing
but
i don't believe that the cdc can study
this
i don't believe this is testable
because there are too many other
variables if if the masks
were one of
three variables
then maybe you could tease it out but we
don't even know why why we don't have a
seasonal flu
like very fundamental questions we don't
know about what's going on so whatever
is happening in terms of
why this thing is spreading
we can't study that
so i wouldn't believe the cdc when they
say masks don't work and i wouldn't
believe them when they say they do
because they can't study it
so you would have to treat it like a
risk management problem if you're
treating it like a a binary
masked work
or
mass don't work
that's not the way to treat this you
have to treat it as a risk management
situation knowing that you don't know
all right um
i guess the uh
new york times is finally reporting uh
that the lincoln project was a big old
scam of grifters
um paraphrasing a little bit but
wouldn't you have liked to know
that the lincoln project was a big old
scam
before the election
we've got some great reporting now
after the election when nobody cares
about the lincoln project they're not
that relevant anymore
but now we find out now we find out
so
i'm having this uh sort of ongoing
twitter exchange with eric
brynjolfsson
he's a professor at stanford i mentioned
him before and he was saying that there
have been a number of bills proposed for
fixing the election system
and he points out that before the
election republicans kill the proposed
law the safe act
which would have required robust robust
manual audits of all federal races and
banned internet
connectivity to voting systems
and then um
[Music]
right and i think there was at least one
other time when when proposed voting
improvements were
killed either by republicans or
democrats or both
now
what do you make of that let's say let's
say there's a bill to improve voting
doesn't matter what the details are and
the republicans kill it
what's that tell you about the bill
does that tell you it was a bad bill
because the republicans voted against it
if you're an idiot it tells you that
yeah
if you have an iq of say 80
just to pick a number
and you hear that the republicans voted
against a voting bill
you'd say to yourself huh
republicans are smart and honest and
trustworthy
and they voted against it
so
therefore it was a bad bill
right
well that would be bad thinking
here's good thinking
the people voting for or against that
bill
got elected under the current system
the current system
with all of its flaws
supports the incumbents
why the hell would the incumbents vote
against their own interest
because anything they change
is going to put them at risk because the
way things are
is perfect
right 98 of incumbents get reelected
that's that's almost perfect
so you're asking the only people on
earth
literally
the only people on earth
who are the wrong people to work on this
problem
because they all benefit from not
changing it that's what an incumbent
benefits from
so
the first thing we need to do is take
them out of the mix
maybe we can let congress vote yes or no
on something that
was let's say put together by
independence
you know if there's some kind of by you
know bipartisan independent commission
that comes up with a bunch of
recommendations
well maybe we could force our
politicians to vote for it if we put
enough pressure on them but the current
this the current system
the current system is ridiculous
don't ask the people benefiting from the
system to change it
that's crazy
all you're going to get is what we're
getting
which is the people who vote against it
will say well i had good reasons
look at all my good reasons for voting
against this and you look at the reasons
and you'll think well actually those are
pretty good reasons
and you'll think that your
representative did a good job voting
against that
nothing like that's happening you have a
bunch of people who have no interest in
changing it and it's their job
and that's the end of the story
it won't change
it can't change
there there's nothing we know about the
world
that would suggest voting will be fixed
if the people who don't want it to be
fixed are the only ones in charge
that's it
so
let's fix that
right
we should not even be having a
conversation about
which politician
voted for or
or proposed a bill
that's stupid talk
we don't care what they propose
i don't care what anybody in congress
proposes they're all
untrustworthy
on this question
on this question they could be
trustworthy on you know any number of
other things
but on this question
the one that determines whether they
personally get reelected no we can't
trust them
we have to take that out of their
control
now let me say this
if biden were to do that
and
let me give you
the most weirdly optimistic thing you've
ever heard in your life
i don't predict this will happen
so unfortunately my prediction and my
optimism are not aligned right now right
but here's something that could happen
what is the one kind of person
who could
change this situation
like what type of person would be in the
right position and have the right
you know mindset and incentives to fix
the voting system
there are two people i can think of
one is biden
and the other is trump
for completely different reasons
biden
has a chance
to go out as one of the greatest leaders
we've ever had
he only has to change one thing
just change the election process to make
it transparent
and credible
now if he were to stay in office and he
were a younger man and he had to live
with the democrats and
put up with whatever pressures they're
putting on him to not change things
well you know i i don't expect things to
change
but
biden doesn't have a lot of days left
and he does have an opportunity
to go out on top
if he only changed
one thing
which was to say i'm going to set up
executive order or something i'm going
to set up a bipartisan commission
and then we're going to br bring the
recommendation to the congress
and i'm going to let the entire public
see
what what we see
public take a look at this watch your
members of congress not vote for this
thing
that a bipartisan commission said is the
only way to fix the election
and then
leave on top
i would be willing to say biden would be
one of our greatest presidents
if he did that one thing
and then even you know
resign and put kamala in charge he's
still the gr one of the greatest if he
does the one thing
now who's the other thing
other person who could do the one thing
trump
but he'd have to be at the end of his
second term
right he's still he still needs to get
elected to a second term if that's what
he wants
but there are only two people can do it
here's the good news
they might be in charge
right one after another so i'm not optim
so i'm not optimistic in terms of her
prediction
but
it could be fixed
yeah yeah i'm a dreamer you're right
yeah the the odds of biden doing that
are vanishingly small but it's
interesting to know that he could and i
will tell you this there is something
about
and this is my private uh
philosoph my private uh let's say view
of the world
that is shared by basically nobody
so here's something you're not going to
agree with
the office changes
the office holder
more than
the person changes the office
meaning that the presidency
has to change you
like no matter what how much of a turd
you were when you were running for
office and working your way up through
politics to become you know a candidate
no matter how bad you were
in those days and how selfish by the
time you become president
it's actually your job
like literally it's your job to take
care of all this stuff i think it
changes you
and
whatever you say about
biden did or did not do in the past and
blah blah blah he's president now
he's the president now and i don't think
he would hate
a chance to go out on top if it really
helped the country
i believe that everybody who's in that
office is a patriot
because the office turns them into one
so
um
that's
that's at least a possibility that's out
there
so
we've got new new evidence from some
independent group
that says that china is involved in a
genuine genocide against the uyghurs
50 global experts in human rights war
crimes and international law
looked into it and said absolutely
positively
it's a uyghur genocide
now
china of course explains it in terms of
trying to
control dangerous extremism
now what they call dangerous extremism
is
you know the extreme version of islam
but here's an interesting and
provocative thought
how could islam ever end without a
genocide
isn't genocide built into the
guaranteed outcome
isn't it because imagine if
islam
continues to spread
and let's say the chinese government
you know degraded to the point where
there were so many islamic citizens that
there weren't that many of the old
chinese type i suppose i don't know how
long that would take a long time i
suppose
but
islam has a interesting characteristic
not so much the way it's practiced in
the united states but if you leave the
religion you can be killed
for leaving the religion
which is a strong advantage for a system
if you want a system that will grow and
not shrink
try killing people who leave
because you can always attract people
and then you don't want to lose any
so islam has a superior system
independent of what you believe about
reality or anything else but in terms of
a growing system it's just a better one
and china has decided that this growing
system which is a superior system
in terms of growth
needs needs to be controlled because it
would be a danger to china are they
wrong
is china wrong
that if if they let
islam flourish
that china would be in trouble
are they wrong
yeah we can't talk about that can we
can't talk about that
because here's the problem
they're not wrong
now the thing they're doing is still a
genocide it's still evil it needs to be
stopped
but they're not wrong about the risk
they're not
because it's built right into the system
it's just at the moment it's very small
but it's it's built to grow
it's like catching a virus early
you don't say the virus if it's only
infected a few people is no problem
you say oh it's a virus
viruses grow
so
you can't there's no way you can you
know morally or ethically support what
china is doing it's a genocide it's a
freaking genocide
but
uh i would only add this
that islam has to end in genocide just
as a question how long it takes
because either the the winners let's say
if islam dominated would end up
crushing and
uh performing genocide i think on a
number of different societies if
if they became dominant enough
so as soon as you uh inject
islam into the system worldwide and
again this is not such an issue in the
united states of course but worldwide
where you have let's say a more
let's say a more robust version of islam
so i don't put an insult on it it's a
more robust version
and
it has to end in genocide
it's just a matter of who get who gets
killed
because that's the system as it's
designed
if it grows it has to create genocides
and china is just saying well if we
genocide you first
you won't later get big enough to
genocide us later because that is in
fact built into your plan
now
it's an interesting question isn't it
it's an interesting question
you can't support genocide
ever under any conditions
but what was the other thing they were
supposed to do
what was what was the other way to plant
they didn't have one
now
can't support it but i'm just pointing
out that it's uh it's a more complicated
situation than you think
all right uh i keep seeing this story
and i can't believe it's real
can you tell me if this story is real
that the chain of custody documents for
400 000
georgia mail-in votes is missing like
permanently missing like they will never
be turned up
and and the state was only won by 12 000
votes in the presidential election
and four hundred thousand of them we
can't trace or audit
i'm looking at your comments
i don't see anybody saying it's not true
everybody thinks it's true
but
how in the world
how in the world
are we okay with this is there something
i don't know about it
is there something i don't know in the
sense that even if they're missing that
doesn't mean that the election was
fraudulent in other words was there some
way that something could be audited
that would make us not worry about this
is there some other way we know we don't
have to worry about it
what am i missing
why is this not the only story
why is there any other story
because wouldn't this be proof
not of a there's no proof of a
fraudulent election but wouldn't it be
proof that it's a non-transparent
election
uh
it feels it feels like we should be able
to say at this point
unambiguously with nobody arguing with
us that the election was not
transparent
this one case alone given that georgia
was important to to a lot of things
how many other states have the same
problem where the chain of custody for
the mail-in votes is missing
is georgia the only one who has this
problem
let me ask you this
if you had a lot of these
these mail-in vote pickup boxes
or or even if they just went through the
post office if somebody was
intelligently throwing away
votes from pro-trump areas
because they would kind of know which
areas were more pro-trump just throw
them all away how would you know
how would you know
if ballots were just
discarded would you know that
now it doesn't look like it could have
been done at a
wide widespread scale because the number
of total votes for both candidates was
so high
so we had an unprecedented number of
votes
so it doesn't look like there were
massive throwing away votes but you
wouldn't have to do it massively you
could do it targeted
so
i i feel as though every time somebody
argues that there was
fraud in the election they're just
walking into a trap
because the trap always
springs the same way
uh i think there was fraud in the
election trap courts say there was no
fraud in the election which has nothing
to do with the claim right because the
court courts didn't really look at much
but you're still done
for some reason that argument beats your
argument
because you don't have proof courts
don't either it's sort of the end of the
argument but when you talk about the 400
000 missing
uh
chain of custody documents
that's a that's proof
of non-transparency
and i think that's the strong argument
the non-transparency
let's see
i'm going to do a micro lesson a little
bit later today on
the locals platform that's where i put
my
stuff that you don't see here
and it's going to be on the
how to use filters
to be successful
here's the key
you know we have filters on the world
such as one filter is everything's
racial another filter is it's always
about the money
another filter is it's always about
power
uh
et cetera so there's lots of filters you
can apply
the mistake we make is to think that the
filter is telling you what the truth is
we don't have access to the truth
so if you're using your filter that way
you're using it wrong
but if you use a filter because it seems
to consistently give you a good outcome
that's good filter
even if
it's not telling you the truth
so what i'm going to teach you on
locals later is how to know that you're
using your filter correctly not as an
indicator of truth
but as a
let's say a
map
for how to solve a problem
and
that will be one of the most useful
things you've ever heard in your life it
really will be
now i want to tell you a a weird
simulation thing from yesterday and i
want you to try this at home
how many times have you lost your phone
when you knew
it had to be
right here somewhere
and then you're looking room to room and
you you and you're saying i literally
just had it in my hand how many times
does that happen to you
and then you look through your whole
house
it just seems to be gone
it's just gone
and
i was doing this last night
and uh i've told you before that i don't
view reality
the same way you do i do i do view it as
that we're literally in a simulation
and i do view it as though history is
created on demand
so if you believe the history is created
on demand
you can make your phone appear
if you believe that there's a base
reality that's just reality
then your phone is lost and he can't
find it
but the moment you believe that your
your entire
experience is subjective
you can make the phone appear
so last night i looked through my whole
house literally had tried every surface
of every room that i knew i was in
and then i stopped and i said all right
all right let's let's
the the normal way of filtering my
environment didn't work my normal filter
didn't work so i'm going to change my
filter
so i said all right consciously i'm
going to change my filter now my new
filter is that
i can make that phone appear
simply by recognizing that i live in a
simulation
and that i can make the past anything i
want it to be and once i've made it that
i'll it will be filled in with false
memories that make it all make sense
and the moment i said that
and said all right suppose it's just a
simulation and i'm going to make that
phone appear
i walked directly over to the phone and
picked it up
true story
the moment i reframed it as a simulation
where i could make the phone appear
i walked directly to it
without stopping
and picked it up
now
now the first thing you're going to say
to yourself is well that's a coincidence
or that just reminded you where the
phone was or it's always in the last
place you look because that's when you
stop looking
so do you think there is any
significance to that
i don't
i don't think there's significance in
terms of some kind of proof that i
caused the phone to appear in some
magical way i don't think that
here's what i do think
as soon as i changed my filter
i found my
phone keep in mind that the filters are
not
viewers of reality
the first filter was not a view of
reality
and the second one was not a view of
reality i did not improve my filter to
see a better reality
i just changed it
and the moment i did something in my
brain worked a little better
and then i walked over and picked up my
phone
the one place i forgot that i had been
right and yeah same thing with glasses
etc so
be very specific about what the claim is
the claim is not that it caused magic
the claim is that shifting your filter
just makes your brain work differently
and that might be
advantageous
that's all just made my brain work
differently and that might have given me
some advantage
so
try it i've done this a number of times
and
you know it's a subjective experience so
it feels like something magic happens
every time
whenever i just say okay it's a
simulation
let's just play it like a game
and it's amazing how often it works
somebody says my mom did that too she
prayed a little bit i wouldn't be
surprised if praying allowed you to find
your phone
for the exactly the same mechanism
you might be able to pray your phone
into existence
um
when i can't watch a scary movie i just
let my wife go through my phone
you know the worst part about letting a
spouse or partner go through your phone
is not the bad stuff that they find
it's the stuff that wasn't bad that
looks like it if you see it out of
context
that's dangerous
that's dangerous
um
ever heard of find my iphone well
it doesn't work so well within the house
it's not that accurate
need a filter on depression
filter on depression well
um
believe it or not that is an area in
which which i put a lot of effort into
figuring out how to reframe your
experience to make yourself happier now
the problem is that depression
i doubt it's the same in all people
right i doubt there's some exact part of
your brain that's always the problem
if you're depressed it's probably a
constellation of different
brain related and experience related
things so it's hard to find one solution
that works for a whole bunch of
different things that just happen to
have the same label
but
that said
for
maybe
some proportion of people who would
label themselves as depressed i would
imagine that there's something you can
do by reframing your experience
that would change it
change your subjective
feeling
imagine if you will just take one
example
suppose you went from having a point of
view that you had no control over your
environment
nothing you could do
now suppose you change that and reframed
it to you have lots of control over your
environment it's a simulation you can
guide it you can build the talent stack
you can do the smart things instead of
the dumplings if you imagine that you
went from having no control
to having all kinds of control
even if nothing's really different it's
just how you're viewing it
would that make you less depressed
well not everybody obviously because
again different reasons for being
depressed but maybe some
maybe some
and
that may not be the reframe that helps
many people but i feel like
there are a lot of reframing
opportunities that we haven't
we haven't used
um
somebody says you jackass is still
looking for those votes
well let me let me address this
there are
two kinds of people
who are really stupid and you're
one of them
um
who is this uh dedra
you're one of the two really
stupid types of people one is you're
positive
that there was a widespread fraud in the
election you're positive
well you haven't really seen the proof
right you've seen statistics and stuff
like that
but it's kind of stupid to say that you
know
that that it was fixed
do you think it was probably fixed
i think people could have could
reasonably think that it probably was
because any system that has a lack of
transparency
and a big gain if you could rig it will
be will be rigged eventually
so
i would say this
it is not
brilliant to say you know it has been
rigged
but it is brilliant to say it will be
eventually if it hasn't been
because this kind of a system has to be
rigged every time
because it's riggable
and there's a really big gain
and
you don't see many people getting caught
well actually we wouldn't know how many
people are getting away with anything
so
under that situation
fraud is guaranteed
but we can't see it right we don't have
access it's not transparent the
so it's stupid to say it's
absolutely was a rigged election it is
equally stupid
maybe stupider a little bit
to say that it definitely wasn't
you don't know that
that's what a non-transparent system
means
how many how many mail-in votes got
thrown away
do you know
i don't know
i don't know
now
so those are the two really serious
stupid opinions definitely was fixed
definitely wasn't
everything in between is
reasonable people with functional brains
you know they're
maybe estimating
opinion that's all fair
the stupid people are on the extremes
like you my friend
just in case you didn't know if you were
stupid
i like like to fill you
um
trump said he won by a landslide well
you know if you are the candidate i
think you have to get a little get a
little slack
you know trump probably has a belief
that's in the
greater than 90 likelihood
so if the candidate exaggerates that to
a certainty that that's just part of the
game but you don't have to do that
you're not talking in public you can
just have a real opinion
and if it's a hundred percent
maybe it shouldn't be
somebody says they think trump has
access to information you don't have
maybe but if it were if it were damning
i think we would know by now
all right
uh that's all i got for now i will talk
to you tomorrow
and maybe tomorrow we'll have
some more interesting news
uh
how can we eliminate the rise of a
permanent political class
well
the problem is that permanent political
class are the only ones who can vote for
uh term limits
so they won't
so there's not much we could do about it
thank you mclean
all right
i just want to see this comment
uh i wish you'd read youtube comments
and not periscope i do both
but um
the the actual reason is that i've got
two ipads here
and the
my periscope ipad is a larger one and i
can just see them a little bit more
clearly
all right um
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you guys
