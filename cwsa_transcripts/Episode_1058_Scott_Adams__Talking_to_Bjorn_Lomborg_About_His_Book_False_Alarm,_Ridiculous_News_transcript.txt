[Music]
hey everybody
come on in gather round it's gonna be a
good one oh yeah
i always say that but isn't it always
right
yeah you know it is i always say it's
gonna be the best one
and and then it is so
i guess you got that going on um if
everything works out i'm going to have
author bjorn
lomborg on here today but i'm terrible
on
follow-up so uh if that doesn't work out
we'll make sure it works out soon but
before i see if i can connect him
uh i'll give him a few minutes if he's
if he's up and around
to uh to connect on periscope before we
do that what do we do first
always the same thing always the same
thing
the best thing ever it's a simultaneous
sip and all you need is
a copper mug of glass attack or chalice
or steiner canteen sugar flask of a
vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the end of the day
the thing that makes everything better
including
coronavirus global
warming climate change you name it it's
all better
with the sip join me now
i can feel the earth begin to cool
i can feel people's fevers beginning to
go down
just a little bit now
bjorn is here yes let's make this work
um
please technology all right first try
did not work
bjorn if you can hear me
it's not unusual for the first try
not to work so um make sure that you're
on a mobile device
such as your smartphone i think you're
back
let's try again all right
bjorn please work oh the technology is
not working
um i never know what the problem is when
it doesn't work
on the first few tries but we'll get
this
watch this
i'm gonna make this work so i can see
him
uh continuing to try to connect
hey bjorn are you there
i can hear you success
wonderful bjorn lomborg you are the
author of
false alarm this excellent book that i'm
holding up right now
and can i describe you as the president
of the copenhagen consensus think tech
would that be you certainly can yes and
uh
i'm looking at your uh your twitter
profile in which you say
that that involves smart solutions
through economic
prioritization which is exact
you're talking my language now bjorn um
and this is your new book false alarm
when is this out is this out
now this is not from uh yesterday so
just fresh off the press all right and
your topic of
primary concern at least in terms of
this book is climate change
correct yes and
before i start asking you some questions
i have to tell you that you and i have a
weird thing
in common that you don't know about and
uh correct me if this is wrong but i
think i have a pretty good memory of
this
the first time i ever saw you was on an
appearance
on bill maher's show do you remember the
first time you were on his show
i it was actually my second time i
remember that i contacted you afterwards
okay yeah yeah yeah no yeah um and
the thing i remembered was that you you
put bill maher
into cognitive dissonance because of
course he's a big climate change
doomer and he normally the doomers are
talking to scientists
not business people who are looking at
both the costs and the benefits
and know how to project things into the
future as people like you do
and you you completely destroyed his
world view
to the point where he the only thing he
could do is act like you didn't
you didn't just say something it was the
damnedest thing i was watching and i
said what just happened here
and then i you know i realized it was
just cognitive dissonance he couldn't
he couldn't process how logically
and obviously right you were because it
didn't fit any of his worldview so he
just
pretended it didn't happen and went on
so
enough about me um
so in your book false alarm available
everywhere
so i'm sure you can get it in everywhere
the books are sold
um you you're basically going through
the skeptic would you call it the
skeptical argument
on climate science or do you have a term
you prefer well i
i would tend to think of it as the
rational point
of climate uh uh the rational climate
argument because look
what i'm trying to say is it's actually
a real
problem but the way that we've been
presented with this
is it's the end of the world and if
you're being told this is the end of the
world and and and remember
this is not just uh uh a vague little
sort of claim
kids around the world are scared witless
you know washington post survey showed
that
57 of all american kids now are afraid
of global warming
and if you ask adults if you ask adults
around the world
it turns out that almost half of all
adults in the world
now believe that it's likely that global
warming will lead to the extinction of
the human race
this is just this is just outrageously
out there
this is a way beyond reasonable concern
this is a small alarm and so i try to
say look that's not what the u.n climate
panel is telling us
it is a problem not the end of the world
and we should fix it sparkly
now uh we're having a little bit of
connection problem i hope that will
resolve itself but walk us through uh my
understanding is that even the
ippc the ultimate international body
that tells you what's going to happen
with climate change
that if you actually look what they say
their imp
the impact on the you know the gdp in
the future
is trivial is that true it's
well perhaps not trivial but it's very
small so to give you a sense of
proportion
uh the they've done estimates of what is
the negative
impact on climate change in about 50
years
so half a century from now the net
impact
of all climate change if we do nothing
will be
equivalent to each person on the planet
losing somewhere between
zero point two and two percent of his or
her income
hold on nothing wait but hold on let's
let's add a little bit of context to
that
when you say losing it that's in that's
an economic term right
you don't actually start with more and
then you end up with less
i think what you're saying is that
instead of making a hundred dollars
over 50 years you only made 98 dollars
exactly which means
you wouldn't even know it you there
would be nothing in your environment or
your experience
which would tell you you didn't get that
extra two percent
right well it would be very hard for
anyone to notice
just to give you a sense the u.n also
expects
that by in 50 years time the average
person on the planet
will be 2.63 times richer than we are
today
right so right do you just point now
that means
in the worst case instead of being true
i'm rich by 2005 we will be
2.56 times rich
yeah uh bjorn is
bjorn if you have some place in your
wherever you are that you've got a
little stronger signal that would be
good your signal is coming in and out
but i look for the the viewers let me
just uh
the point is that you'll be 2.6 to
2.6 times richer by then so that little
bit you didn't get
that maybe you could have gotten you
won't even know the difference
um and
the big problem with the climate change
argument is that there are not enough
people like you
who are who are looking at not just the
um
the science of it because people get
stuck on the science because it's not
really a scientist
who can tell you what the problem's
going to be and people don't get that
the person who can tell you what the
problem is going to be
is the person who can tell you what's
going to happen to the economy
because if the economy is still strong
you can fix almost anything would you
say
that's true that's absolutely true
and but but i i think we also need to
recognize
it's not like this is an unheard of
argument
uh so the only climate economist to get
the nobel prizes bill northhouse from
yale university
and this is exactly what he points out
he says
look global warming gonna be a problem
yeah and and by the way as far as i know
i've never heard a scientist argue with
what you say
because you're sort of a slightly
different domain than science
but i don't think scientists say you're
wrong do they
well a lot of scientists are not
comfortable with this not being alarmist
so i think a lot of them will say that
doesn't sound right
talking about real world impacts one of
the things that drive me up the wall and
that's what i use
uh pretty much the first third of the
book to talk about is
how you are being scared to stories that
are
technically true but often dramatically
misleading let me give you one example
uh last year uh washington
told us how uh because global warming
people need 187 billion people being
flooded by the
metric this one bjorn
there's a little bit of problem with
your connection i might break in and
just summarize what
what i'm hearing you saying so the
audience hears it clearly so you're
saying there was 187
million people projected to be uh
victims of flooding is that what you
said
yes sorry i'm just trying to move to
another part of the house does this work
better
that's better yes okay uh
so yes 187 million people would get
flooded this was the
washington post uh headline and
everywhere
on the planet what that required was
that nobody anything in the next 80
years so basically
this
yeah we're having more audio problems
but i think what you're saying is that
the
assumption is that nobody would do
anything about it there would no
there would be no remediation over 80
years when in fact
uh what is uh is that
what's the country that's already
underwater uh
holland all right so yeah uh
so so we can see that the uh the ability
to remediate
against flooding is pretty good if you
have 80 years
and you've got a lot of time now what
what the
what the study actually showed was if
you allow people to adapt which of
course they will
of course you will not see 187 million
people having to move
you'll see 305 000 people having to move
so it was 600 times exaggerated
and of course remember every year more
than twice
that number move out just of california
so it's it's not something that the
world can't
adapt and handle we're simply being told
stories
that are very scary but end up being
very little representative
of the real world because we forget
adaptation is
give me an idea what's behind all the
exaggeration
in the sense that the the obvious thing
is that the the news model
requires you to get worked up in order
to click on things for them to get
advertising income
so aside from the the media which
has an incentive to exaggerate things
for their business model is there
anything else
behind the wrongness
well i i think the the media part is an
incredibly important part of it and
and we we tend to forget that media
exaggerates on all kinds of things
it's just that global warming turns out
to be such an
incredibly good generator of really
scary stuff
but of course it's also because
politicians
love this setup look you can't really
make a better setup than what you're
seeing with
global warming politicians get to say
the end of the world is made
but i can save you right and also
we get to say i can save you and the
cost will only come in the next election
so yeah well you know i i i used to do
uh you know financial projections and
stuff in my
corporate job long ago and the perfect
situation for any
corporate uh person is that you get to
spend money today and be a hero for what
you're fixing
but nobody will know it will work until
you've already been promoted or left for
another job
in other words exactly what you want to
spend money today
because that's how you get power and
influence and hey look at all these
things i did
and then you will never be responsible
for the outcome because that's in 80
years
and oh absolutely and and you know the
the fun thing is to see
we've been doing this for 30 years so
you can actually look back
and see how little we've achieved so
last year the un actually
released a very surprisingly honest
review
of what we've achieved over the last 15
years and what they said was
we cannot tell the difference after all
the work up from obama and everybody
else around the world
all the money they could not tell
differently
in the world nothing since 2005.
you know isn't there that this feels
like a subset
of a problem that is plaguing basically
every big public decision which is
our data is undependable and the people
who are analyzing the data are not
qualified
it feels like it's everything from
coronavirus to
you name it it just seems to be the same
problem
the data's bad and we don't know how to
look at it anyway
i i would i'll probably analyze it
slightly differently because i think we
you know we spent in
in the order of what uh 50 billion
dollars on
on on climate research so it's not like
we don't have
a lot of good data i think there is a
lot
of organizations that want to convince
you this is the end of the world because
then they can get you
to support really really expensive
policies
uh and i think we as taxpayers
need to fight back and say look i'm
happy to spend money
on pro on solving real problems that'll
actually have
dramatic impact to better the world in
the future but i'm not just going to
spend my money to do almost no good and
waste most of it
and uh what do you think of uh if you
had a moment to look at
i don't know if you follow american
politics enough but uh joe biden's
two trillion dollar plan which i had to
dig really hard
uh i had to look through multiple
articles to find out if
nuclear energy was even part of it so 2
trillion
and and the most of the coverage didn't
even mention
nuclear energy but i found one article
that suggested
he wants to go strong at nuclear and
especially the new
and the new designs which the trump
administration
doesn't talk about it but they're doing
all of that stuff
they're pushing for the the new test
facilities etc
um is that a productive way to go does
that this
is nuclear on your uh on your good list
nuclear is definitely one of the
solutions that we could envision
for global warming i think the big
problem about nuclear is
that right now nuclear is much more
expensive than most other power sources
that's why we need a lot more research
and development
into you know the fourth generation
nuclear power plants
so for instance bill gates and many
others are spending lots of resources
to get that next generation that's going
to be safer
cheaper and also much more dependable
if we can do that that'd be amazing but
again
this is just one of the many ways that
we could fix
climate you know innovation
fundamentally is going to be the way
that we will fix this problem
like basically every other problem yeah
exactly
and when i look at the nuclear situation
it's too expensive i don't know if
you've
dug into the the details of that enough
to answer this question but
the the things that are stopping us is
number one it's hard to
iterate if you if you try something it's
really expensive to build a second
nuclear energy plant
and see if the the second one is better
than the first one so it's not like
building an iphone where you can just do
it in the lab until you get it right
so that's one problem the other problem
is that we don't standardize
the big ones so we've got multiple
models
and if you just built the same damn
thing one after another even using
current
generation three technology before you
even get to the
super safer safer stuff of generation
four
could we do generation three
let's call it current technology which
has had uh
zero deaths historically is that true
zero deaths from it's very very very low
deaths yeah
i think it's zero actually if depending
on how you count it
and um are those the two problems you
see
iteration i guess uh government
regulation and how long that takes
but iteration and standardization are
those are the two things that will
change the economics
my understanding again from from nuclear
technology is that that's really what's
been lacking we've been
building masterworks uh each one of them
instead of actually building
just a long stream of them and and
indeed that is one of the points that
they're trying to do with forced
generation
to say if we can standardize this and
basically build it like a
uh uh uh a uh uh
uh what do you say a factory of a
forty sort of assembly plant sorry that
was what i was looking for
an assembly plant where we just churn
out all of these and you just
assemble them like liga uh lego on on on
the spot
and then you run it that will be
enormously much cheaper but again
it requires a lot of research and
development because we're not there
you know when you look at the new power
plant set up nuclear power plants that
they
build around the world they end up being
fantastically expensive and
one of the reasons as you just pointed
out is because there's all this
regulation and i just find it's going to
be very hard to imagine that that
regulation will go away
yeah and the secondary problem i
understand is that if the
nuclear power plant is are these
one-offs
then you don't have something that you
can export to other countries
and if you're not the uh let's say the
big brother of the smaller nuclear
program
in the smaller country then somebody
else is going to be
and that could be china or china or
russia so you so
simply by not having a robust nuclear
energy program in this country
we're giving up uh we're giving up
influence over
a lot of the planet but worse when you
go to space
it's going to be nuclear power and if
you don't own space you might as well
just give up
because whoever owned space owns the
planet that's the end of it
that's that's my opinion
no but i i think i think the fundamental
point here and the insight is
to recognize that unless we get cheap
green energy
we're just not going to switch over
because you're not going to convince
most people around the planet to say all
right i'll get the same power
slightly less effectively slightly less
dependably
and much much more expensively that's
just not a selling point for
except for you know a few percent for
people who are very very engaged in
climate
and so the reality is we need to invest
a lot more into green energy research
and development
to do that and actually you know to his
uh credit
that is part of biden's plan so you know
at least there's a lot of things in
biden's plan and a lot of them i
i think are going to be waste of money
but that actually turns out to be a
really good idea
yeah um and there's also a weird thing
that
uh i can't get over which is the people
who are most concerned about climate
change
you know they they tend to be focused on
the political
left i don't think that they understand
how racist it is
because that's their other biggest issue
to let's reduce racism
but if you say to the developing
countries you can't use what we used
to get here because it's too polluted
then are you
basically just telling all the brown
people that they can't have what white
people have
now it's like oh no no we got here this
way by using
your oil and coal but you can't do that
you're gonna have to wait why don't you
just wait and we'll find something clean
for you
we don't know how long it'll take but
until then you'll have to starve would
you mind
waiting it's the most freaking racist
thing
you've ever heard there's nothing
there's no black lives matter thing
there's no
i mean this is this is on a level
literally
with slavery in terms of uh
how prejudicial it is against people of
other colors
i mean it's it's massively destructive
and yet the same group are in favor of
both of those things
and we think this all the time you know
we're basically telling poor countries
no you can't have
uh coal power because it is going to
make coal mine worse which is true
but of course that coal power also going
to make that country
much much richer so we work together
to look at what would it take to put in
extra
it would dramatically increase life
quality in bangladesh
the average person in bangladesh is
about 16
richer yeah yeah
create global war problems but just to
give you a sense of proportion for every
100
you produce for bangladesh you create
20 cents of climate problems yeah
we have a little audio problems again so
let me let me uh just uh do one more
topic here and then we'll
let you get to the rest of your day i'm
sure uh with a new book out you've got a
lot to do this week
my guess guesses um so i'm
really interested in the uh the super
storm
and the natural disaster story where
every time there's a hurricane
somebody on television will tell us that
climate change is what caused that darn
hurricane
what's the more reasonable rational view
of the big storms and natural national
or natural disasters
so we're certainly not seeing more
storms hitting the u.s actually if you
look at landfalling hurricanes
and strong landfalling hurricanes
they've slightly declined
over the last 120 years for the u.s
but in general much much more
importantly is
that many more people live much closer
to harm's way with
much more stuff so fundamentally the
reason why you see
dramatic impacts of hurricanes now is
because there's many more people you
know look at florida coastal counties
florida popular coastal population has
increased over the last 120 years
a 67 fold whereas the u.s population has
only increased fourfold so clearly they
also have much more expensive homes
so clearly you're going to get a lot
more damage and again
if you want to help these people the way
to do so
is by getting better building code and
also
still they're going to get wiped out
everyone
yeah and you know i i always look at
that situation and i ask myself
who is it that lives on the beach
because it's not the poor people right
uh no okay in the united states i mean
it must be different in other places but
in the united states
it feels like there's a pretty strong
correlation between being rich and being
able to have a house on the beach
and if i were to ask if i were to say
what would be the best thing for the
economy of the united states
i'm just joking here but just to make a
point the best thing for the economy of
the united states
would be for a big storm to come by
about every three years
knock down all the rich houses and give
the poor people
not poor people but the middle class
people who do construction
more work because because the rich
people have insurance
insurance is priced to pay for itself
the rich people live in their other
house while the
you know the beach house is being
repaired i mean you you could imagine
that it would be a plus
to wipe out rich people's houses every
few years just so people have
enough to do to rebuild them uh i'm just
kidding on that but
yeah it would certainly teach them to be
better at producing their houses well
i mean and one of the big problems of
course is that we're subsidizing
rich people because we're subsidizing
much of their insurance
uh so we should definitely not be doing
that and that of course would get fewer
people to build close to harm's way
right yeah subsidizing people to build
that that's just crazy
uh all right so what is it that i uh uh
i'll give you the question that every
author
hates but uh since you're toward the
beginning of your book tour
i'll get you ready for it okay so this
would just be practice
the worst question everybody wants to
hear as an author
what is it i forgot to ask you
in other words it's just a chance to
mention something that maybe you wanted
to mention that sure
so so i think i think the the rest of
the book really is about
two things it's first of all talking
about all the things that haven't worked
so
you know we we promised the paris
agreement uh
it's gonna cost one to two trillion
dollars a year and it'll
do almost nothing to actually fixing
climate change
we're telling you
a little bit bjorn we're losing the
audio a little bit um i think we got the
gist of that though
uh would you mind if we uh if we end now
just because the audio
is kind of sketchy sorry about that i
don't
know i can hear you perfectly
oh okay you're cutting a little bit in
now i'll make sure everybody knows
your book i'm holding it up i'll tweet
about you and i thank you very very much
for
uh for coming on this you're exactly the
kind of author that my audience
likes to hear from so thank you very
much and good luck with the book
hey thank you very much scott all right
take care everyone
all right bjorn is one of my favorite uh
public figures has been for years
because he
he's one of the few people who look at
the costs and the benefits
and know how to do it it's a it's
refreshing all right a few other things
um yesterday i was
trying to change a light bulb and i
ended up tweeting about it because it
was so hard it was one of those compact
fluorescents
and in in theory you just pull it out
straight and push it in straight
but it didn't work and so i'd spent over
a month trying to change one light bulb
i'd ordered different bulbs thinking
maybe i had the wrong one
i tried everything and uh the funniest
part about it was
listening to the other people's comments
because when i tweeted it
you know people weighed in with their
comments but the funny part was how many
people have thrown away
perfectly good lamps and and light
fixtures to change the light fixture
because they couldn't figure out how to
change the light bulb
now if you've never tried to change a
compact
fluorescent light bulb you don't know
how hard it is
and again this is let me let me explain
this is the entire process
here's a hole here's the light bulb
pushes straight in
if you want to take it out pull it
straight out
and i spent a month not being able to do
it
even trying that exact thing and
apparently other people have just thrown
away their lamps
changed their fixtures hired a handyman
to just change the entire life texture
because they couldn't change the light
bulb
and here's the point of this this was
not just to
complain about my uh personal inability
to do things
the larger point is this and i'm going
to hit this a lot
who tested that this is a gigantic
national standard
who tested that how many times did they
have
an average person come in and say hey
can you see if you can change this bulb
and then watch them
now if you try to remove a compact
fluorescent you'll find that it breaks
in your hand
about half of the time it breaks the
glass part just breaks off in your hand
when you're trying to just change the
bulb
uh nobody tested that and so
i submit to you that we have a gigantic
problem in this country
and the world of products that were
never tested and yet are now standard in
all of our homes
never test it um have you heard a lot
about
mary trump's book
no you know mary trump the niece of
trump who wrote an
anti-anti-donald trump book
and apparently the worst thing that uh
that came out of this because it's the
one that they pull from the book
is that she alleges that donald trump
paid someone to take his sats
that's it now first of all i doubt it's
true i mean anything's possible
it wouldn't change my opinion of
anything because i have that 20-year
rule
i just don't care what people did when
they were 18.
do you care what anybody did when they
were 18 would you
would you say we've got to impeach this
president because when he was 18 he did
something clever that worked out well
i'm sure it wasn't you know if it
happened and by the way
i would say the odds of it being true
are not really that high
but even if it is true that's it that's
the best you have
you're an insider you've got all this
access to the family
and the best you have is that when he
was 18 he did something that any 18 year
old would have done if they could have
gotten away with it
ah that's pretty empty
apparently kanye is out he's out of the
race but here's what's interesting
um he actually did try to get on the
ballots
so there is uh documented evidence that
he put real money into trying to get on
the ballots so he was serious
some of you wondered if he was serious
but
i think that's been answered he was
serious now what do you make of the fact
that he was in the race for you know
less than two weeks
do you say to yourself well that proves
he's a flake and
he was never really that serious and
what kind of a president is he
would he be if he didn't even plan the
you know getting nominated and all that
the way it should be
here's my answer to that he played it
perfectly i think
kanye played it perfectly
because here's what i always say there's
nothing better
for improving your odds of becoming
president
than having run in the past right
uh trump had sort of flirted with
running in the past
and therefore because every time there
was an election for
several elections before the time he
actually got elected
trump's name was always in the top ten
because he put it there trump put his
name
in the top 10 for every future election
by simply making noise but not going
very far
in initial attempts or initial
flirtations with running
initial talking about running etc kanye
is using the same play
it you know people who have lost
elections then went on to win
were you know quite a few right nixon
reagan
trump himself it's fairly common
biden is has run before and that has a
lot to do with why he's
uh where he is although being vice
president was more of it
and i would say that kanye's play
of reminding us of kanye for president
letting us wrestle with the idea for a
little while
and then waiting until 2024 was exactly
exactly the right play exactly the right
play because he didn't really have a
chance of winning and everybody would
have been mad at him if he
if he changed the election result which
he would have it probably would have
caused
trump to win sorry my cat's in the way
so i don't think he could have played
that better honestly the get in and get
out in 2020
if i could have advised him you know if
and i didn't by the way
but if i could have advised him on the
best way to play this i would have said
this
i always said flirt with it get in there
get some noise
but really you're getting ready for
2024. perfect
i am entering a voluntary coronavirus
quarantine
starting today i believe which is
not because i have coronavirus as far as
i know
i do have a test scheduled but it's not
because i may or may not have
coronavirus it's because i have some
minor surgeries scheduled so the current
process
in case you didn't know for getting a
surgery in this environment
and by the way i expect the surgery to
get cancelled it's in two weeks and i
expect it to get canceled
because of capacity but at the moment
it's scheduled
and that means that i have to quarantine
for two weeks
and that means no christina right i mean
i'm talking about the serious kind of
quarantine
so that starts today i might get a
little squirrely
and i might do some evening podcasts
just because i'll be here all alone for
two weeks
now the process is they'd like you to
quarantine yourself
for two weeks before surgery but one
week
before surgery i'll have the actual test
that takes about two days to get a
result
so something like you know five days
before surgery
i'll have presumably a negative test
and then i will uh go into my surgery
i think they test again just before you
go into surgery but i'm not sure
all right uh
there's a lot else going on today
um i i always talk about stefan
collinson who's an opinion person for
cnn
uh and he's i i start to think of him as
triumph the insult dog
so triumph the insult dog uh was on
uh uh what's his name uh
tall redheaded guy uh uh you know
you know the you know the thing oh
my god i just turned into joe biden
you know the thing uh tall
redhead night show
uh give me the name why the hell am i
blanking on his name
you know it is all right um
and he writes that uh this is a
president who has tremendously failed to
beat back the virus
and has long since stopped trying to
lead the country out of the darkness
he's saying that the president has
failed to beat back the virus
and he stopped trying to lead the
country out of the darkness
now here's my question for cnn because
they have a lot of
a lot of commentary about the president
doing everything wrong
here's my question uh yeah conan o'brien
thank you
okay i don't feel bad that i can't
remember
a person named conan because that's not
exactly
bob all right um
and here's my question for cnn
what is it that the president should
have done differently
whoever asked that question if the
president is doing everything wrong
and as triumph the insult dog stefan
collinson says
that he's he's he's stopped trying to
lead us out of the darkness and he's
failed to beat back the virus
what exactly should he have done
differently because
all of the decisions about closing and
opening are local
right the president i think did
all the things that a president could do
he closed international travel
from china and europe so those are
things the president can do
he made sure that we had enough
ventilators
something a president could do and he
you know
uh did i think a good job or the country
did or somebody did
and getting the ppe and the protective
stuff
although we may be running out soon
because of the new stuff
what exactly is it that the president
should have been doing
should he have followed the expert's
advice
well if he'd followed the expert's
advice he wouldn't have done the things
that were right
right he wouldn't have taken the virus
seriously he wouldn't
close travel from china he wouldn't have
done those things
if he'd listened to the experts
and then what about the mask situation
well that was complicated because there
was a
you know there was an effort to save the
masks for the healthcare professionals
which i agree with
i don't know if that was the best way to
do it but i'm not going to criticize
i'm not going to criticize fauci or
others for lying about masks
if the purpose was it was just the only
way to protect them for the health care
people
and i don't know another way if you said
to me no scott the obvious way to do
that
would be tell the public the truth and
just ask them not to hoard
these supplies well in the real world
that doesn't work in a pandemic people
are gonna hoard
you can ask them not to hoard oh but
people are gonna hoard
so if you can tell them they don't need
to hoard
there's no purpose to it maybe it's a
better play
so did fauci and other experts
the surgeon general for example did they
intentionally lie to us
about the value of masks i don't know if
all of them did
some of them might have believed the
other experts and just parroted them
but if they did lie to us but the
purpose of it was for our own good
i'm actually okay with that i don't know
if you are
but i do not mind my leaders lying to me
under the very unique circumstances that
is in my best interest
now usually that's not the case
so you don't want lying to be approved
i just don't know that there are too
many cases like this one
where unfortunately lying was maybe the
only
only good play for the benefit of the
country i hate it
i mean you could be you can hate it but
if you don't have a better idea
just keep that in mind all right
and was there some expert who knew all
the right answers and didn't tell the
president
was there was there some smart thing
that smart experts knew that if they'd
only told the president
then he would have maybe implemented i
haven't heard of any
have you so when they say the president
is failing
don't you have to ask yourself at what
are not other countries also having
problems
and is the president to blame for what
happened with nursing homes
not really now where you could have
room for disagreement would be the
the president advocating going back to
school
at the same time that um
others would say that's a bad idea
because it will increase
infections i am solidly on the
president's
side on going back to school
but here's the thing we live in a world
where you're not allowed to tell the
truth in public but i can
watch this i'm going to tell the truth
in public ask me
and ask yourself if you've ever heard
this
going back to school will kill teachers
and it will kill kids
i'm in favor of it okay
that's the first honest opinion you've
ever heard in public
going back to school will kill teachers
some of them will kill
some students probably not too many as a
percentage
will spread the infection will kill
grandma
when the kid comes home all of that's
going to happen
and it's almost certainly better than
the alternatives
because we don't have a better
alternative we just don't
so i think our best play is to do the
best we can
of protecting the teachers etc here's my
suggestion i understand that teachers
are far
less enthusiastic about opening schools
than parents are
big surprise right who is surprised that
the teachers
many of them older many of them
susceptible who is surprised that they
wouldn't want to go to work
in a crowd you know even with some
social distancing
it's kids so they're not going to be
that disciplined
uh who would be surprised the teacher
doesn't want to go back to that
environment
you shouldn't be too surprised right and
i don't think
that we should abuse one professional
class
teachers who did not sign up for danger
duty right people who decided to be
teachers
did not wake up one day and say i think
i'd like to be on the front line of a
dangerous situation
no no i have a different opinion about
the military and about health care
professionals
because they did sign up for that they
did say
i am going to intentionally put myself
into
infectious and or dangerous situations
this is the career i choose
there's a bigger benefit i take the risk
if that's what we were talking about i'd
say all right
all right you know we'll send the kids
back to school and
you've signed up for it but teachers did
not sign up for that risk
it is completely unreasonable completely
unfair
for the rest of the public to try to
force them back to work
into a situation that at least half of
them think is too dangerous
given the costs and the benefits here's
what i would suggest
as a workaround are you ready
the benefit of a teacher in the room as
opposed to
remote teaching is that it's it's just a
first of all it's a way to get the kids
out of the house
so the parents can go to work so there's
certainly a
child you know watching process
that you you need a physical school for
secondly
you need to hand out things and
discipline people and say stop doing
that
etc here is my hybrid
solution that the that the teacher
only appears remotely if they prefer
let's say the older teachers don't want
to take the risk
they can prefer they can appear on a
television remotely to their class
but you would have a much younger person
let's say a college age type person
who is the in-class
manager if you will so let's put a name
on it because they're not teaching
the the young person who's the physical
presence and the authority in the room
would simply be a manager of the
situation
but the teaching would still come from
the teacher who would be in a big old tv
screen right in front of the class
they could still hear the teacher the
teacher could still see the class
and anything physical that needed to be
done could be done by the
younger less risky
you know person who's sitting in now
or how about let me give you another
suggestion let's say you build
a separate entrances and exits and
bathrooms for teachers
so you have a situation where the
teacher is just behind plexiglass
the whole time just behind plexiglass
and you never actually are physically
could touch a teacher you couldn't even
get close to them if you wanted to
because the teachers in the front of the
class and there's just a big
plexiglass thing here they couldn't get
there if they wanted to
now you don't need plexiglas if you have
enough space from the first row of desks
to the teacher i mean it could be just a
fence so that nobody
you know gets close but you could
probably
figure ways around it now one of the
things i heard is that
it's impossible to open up the schools
with social
distancing in other words the desks
being six feet apart there's just enough
physical space
i would challenge that assumption
because i think that in an emergency
situation you would use all of the space
you might you might uh you know not use
the gym
for gym class because maybe it's too
dangerous to have an inside gym class
anyway
so you might use some of the the gym
floor you might use some of the
cafeteria floor
and while it's warm you make people eat
outdoors you probably want to do that
anyway
so probably you could get pretty close
now some students might want to still
stay home and they could just
tune in digitally just like anybody else
so i think that the president's instinct
to
push toward reopening is absolutely
correct
if you take all the pluses and minuses
of the economy et cetera into
consideration
but you have to protect the teachers you
have to protect the teachers
that is completely unreasonable to send
them back into this
virus petri dish i do not support that
so if we don't have a solution
that the teachers are okay with i say
don't do it
keep the kids home because you can try
harder
right if if your district hasn't figured
out a way to keep the teachers safe
they should boycott or strike or
something
and i would be on their side because we
do have enough
ways to keep them safe if we're not
using it
then they should not go to work that's
my opinion but we do want to solve that
all right um
so ivanka trump is not getting enough
attention
in my opinion for her alternative career
path
effort so she's working on a deal i
don't know all the details but i think
she's working with big corporations
to try to train and hire people who do
not have college degrees
so that you could say well i want to
learn this specialty
i don't need an english degree to do
this job but if this corporation will
teach me
that's a good solution i think that's
one of the best things happening in the
country right now
in terms of it makes sense on every
level and it's just so
obviously good for you know minority
people it's obviously good for
low-income people
it's obviously good for anybody who
doesn't want a college debt
this is just one of the best things
that's happening in the country and it
gives us a little bit of coverage and
then people mock it because it's ivanka
right i mean it's
it's a crazy world when the best things
are ignored
um joe biden had one of the most
classic uh gaffes i've ever heard
and this one he didn't even stop to
correct it
and he he said in a sentence we have to
get our kids back to school
and then he said in the same sentence we
have to get our kids to market
swiftly we have to get our kids
to market swiftly and he didn't even
stop to correct it they just went on
what what
are you kidding
are you kidding so just add that to the
list
now again i remind you that the
hilarious thing to me
is watching democrats act like there's
nothing wrong with biden
i don't see it yeah yeah he misspeaks
now then but
nothing wrong of course the larger
context is the
wayfarer rumors are you aware of those
all right the most ridiculous fake news
or fake i guess it's a rumor it's not
news that the actual
news people are not covering this
because it's not true
which is strange for the news business
usually they cover things whether
they're true or not
but in this case uh i would agree with
them not covering it and the
the rumor on the internet is that the
the big company wayfair
that sells furniture is a gigantic
entity
has been secretly using their the pages
of their website
to sell children instead of products
okay i could stop there and you would
say okay that doesn't sound true
and you'd be right because wayfair is
not really selling children
but people have these fake pages and
they've got their argument because this
uses children's names on the products
and
has a price that doesn't make sense and
i don't know if they're photoshopped or
mistakes or what
but what i can tell you with complete
confidence
wayfair is not selling children
they're not selling your children but in
the context of these wayfarer rumors
which are all over the internet and
again i say it
wayfair isn't doing anything none of
none of that's true
it's ridiculous right now if i'm wrong
on this
you should never listen to me again okay
if i'm wrong about this wayfarer thing
being ridiculously stupid and not true
if it turns out i'm wrong never listen
to me again
that's your deal you have permission to
never listen to me again
but i'm pretty confident about that one
i've decided that uh non-fiction writers
are the most dangerous
people in the world because
they don't know what they don't know but
they think they know a lot
and so the more i see writers writing
stuff
and they don't know what they're talking
about they are seriously
leading the world in the wrong place if
you saw my bjorn
lomborg uh conversation just now
you know that the information that you
and i receive
about climate change is from writers
mostly because i don't talk to
scientists too much
i just read what is written so really
i'm
reading the opinion and the framing from
a writer
and it's so dangerously bad and
uh you know unable to look at costs and
benefits and
incapable of analyzing anything i want
to give you an example of that
um well yeah okay
i got a good example that coming up
uh it's in a bloomberg opinion piece
there's a thread on it today
that i tweeted but listen to this one
um one sentence by
an actual professional writer who gets
paid by bloomberg
or actually i don't know if it's an
opinion piece do they get paid
i don't know their business model but
it's an opinion piece in bloomberg
it has said this it was the this is one
comment in a larger piece
about um all the the rich people
complaining about cancel culture
so this is a piece in favor of cancel
culture
so we could stop right there you know
you don't even need to know what the
writer said
if they're writing in favor of canceled
culture
maybe you shouldn't listen to them but
let me let me read this ridiculous
sentence
quote could it be that increasingly
diverse
voices and rich conversations are a
threat
to their free speech uh and he's talking
about the rich people who wrote
the uh there was some 30 some people who
signed a document
against cancel culture so that's the
context could it be that increasingly
diverse voices
and rich conversations are a threat to
their free speech
or more accurately the prerogative
the prerogative i hate that word
the prerogative of famous and powerful
people to speak at length
on all sorts of things without
interruption or disagreement
so this writer is asking the question
if there's really a problem with
canceled culture is there really
is this really a bad thing all you rich
famous writers
or are you just complaining about it to
get more space for
your own ridiculous comments without any
counter comments
now i'm not even going to tell you
what's wrong with this
opinion because it's so stupid i don't
need to right
i'm pretty sure that the people railing
against canceled culture
do not have a secret agenda of
silencing the rich and diverse
voices and conversations i'm pretty sure
that
zero people have ever had that thought
in their head zero
zero people on the whole planet seven
billion plus people not one person has
ever had the thought
because it's a stupid one that this
writer has assigned it to them
could it be that they don't like diverse
voices and rich conversations
uh no it could not be that
and this is someone who's paid bloomberg
actually princess stuff
amazing amazing speaking of writers
writer uh barry weiss barry b-a-r-i
a woman's name in this case barry was
uh until recently she just quit a staff
writer and editor for the new york times
and she was she describes herself as a
centrist
uh and in the world of new york times a
centrist
means far right
that's that's my own framing not
anything that anybody else said
and although she does call herself a
centrist but that means that she has
some
i would say as a centrist would be
somebody who has a little bit of
appreciation
or empathy for the opinions on the right
may not share them all but would have a
little bit more appreciation for them
but also for the left without
necessarily agreeing with them all so
that's my
understanding of a centrist somebody's a
little bit open to both sides but
doesn't necessarily agree with
either side at all things she
she quit because she said
that it was just an unfriendly place to
work and that because she was not as
left as the other people i'm
paraphrasing this is not her words
then she was basically it was just such
a toxic environment that she just had to
get out of there
but here's one of her one of her uh
comments
in a lengthy uh resolution letter which
is worth reading
is that she said twitter is not on the
masthead
of the new york times but twitter has
become its ultimate editor
oi said uh and
she she goes on stories are chosen and
told in a way
to satisfy the narrowest of audiences
rather than to allow a curious public
to read about the world and then draw
their own conclusions
then she says i was always taught that
journalists were charged with writing
the first
rough draft of history now history
itself
is one more ephemeral thing molded to
fit the needs of a predetermined
narrative well barry the first thing you
got wrong
is to assume that history was ever
objectively written by anybody
history is not objective
history is written by the winners and
you know whoever gets to write about it
so she was wrong on that but
i love this framing of the
in this case the new york times the most
let's say
prestigious of all news organizations we
might say
that even they according to this insider
who just quit
are basically just parroting twitter
now who is the first person who told you
that influential people on social media
are actually the new government i did
right so social media has effectively
become the new government
because the media has to parent social
media
i don't know if they have to but their
business model sort of
influences them that direction and
and once the social media and the media
have you know formed an opinion the
politicians fall in line
so the politicians you know they may uh
suggest a new idea
but that is sort of up to social media
and the public and then the
and then the regular media to support it
or not
and then the politicians know what
freedom they have to either go with it
or not
and of course when i say the public
supports it or not i mean
their side so there are only things in
our world that are supported by the left
and only things supported by the right
and the few things in the middle we
don't hear much about because it's not
fun
all right here's some more cancellations
uh
viacom cbs decided to can
uh what's his name nick cannon
because they allege he made anti-semitic
comments
in his podcast and here's the funny
thing about it
uh when i read the comments
that he made i at least based
i didn't hear the details maybe it's
worse if you hear the the full thing
but just the surface reporting of the
things he said
i don't know it just sounds like an
opinion to me it did not sound like
he was intentionally doing anything
anti-semitic
and indeed he considers himself sabbatic
in other words and even he said this how
can i be anti-semitic when the whole
thing i was saying was that i'm semitic
so you can't be anti yourself
and i thought well okay you could argue
whether he's semetic or not
but you can't argue the point that if he
includes himself in the in the group
that he's criticizing
then it's more like criticizing your own
group it's a weird hybrid
because who is it that gets to say that
nick cannon is
or is not semitic and you know he's
got some story about black people being
the real semitic people
i don't know if it's true or false but
whether it's true or false
or has any historical backing i have no
opinion i don't care
doesn't matter doesn't sound right it
doesn't sound right
right i mean it doesn't sound right but
that doesn't mean it's not right i just
don't have any knowledge or
information to argue it one way or the
other
but because he did not apologize he got
canned and i asked you
should you apologize for insulting your
own group
as you see it
somebody says it was anti-white is what
it was could be i didn't see the details
did not see the details and there was
something about the the rothschild in
there
that you know makes your eyebrow go up
what what do you say about the
rothschild because
there might be a little conspiracy
theory in there so i don't know what he
said
but i just note that that happened and
he didn't apologize
and i'm not sure that you should
apologize if it's your actual opinion
do you apologize if it's your opinion
and you still hold it
because that doesn't seem like an
apology situation
that seems like i just have an opinion
and somebody didn't like it so they
fired me
i know i'm not supporting his opinion
and i'm not
attacking it uh it's just a weird hybrid
that he did not have bad intentions
whatsoever
i think i think can't tell what people
are thinking really but it looked like
that
all right um
here's something i did that hasn't
gotten me canceled and i think that that
is
hilarious i i tweeted this
yesterday and where do you see how much
attention it got
i tweeted this i said have you ever seen
an engineer scientist or statistician
argue that police are killing black
citizens at an alarming rate
ask yourself why now do you see what i
did there
uh let me explain it because i think you
see the general idea but there's
a little bit more to it the natural
frame
for our conversations about big stuff
and the black lives matter stuff is big
stuff
our natural frame is either the left
versus the right
or maybe black versus white or
you know black versus non-black but our
natural inclination
is to just put things in this this group
versus that group
which is terribly unproductive and also
makes you stupid
because you're not really using reason
you're just saying well what team am i
on
so i guess i support the team but what i
did was reframe that
instead of thinking it was black versus
non-black or left versus right
how about people who know how to look at
data versus people who don't
[Laughter]
how about that that's my frame people
who are trained
to understand data and to analyze it
versus people who don't and so i put
this on here and you would think that i
would get cancelled immediately for this
but unlike nick cannon
i think people are afraid of me meaning
afraid to give attention to this point
of view
because you know
if you gave attention to the point of
view that the black lives matter
protests the the primary trigger not the
only topic they have
they have general topics about systemic
racism etc
but the trigger the primary thing that
the
the protests have been about the george
floyd situation
is complete it's complete
and i gave myself enough freedom
by setting the groundwork in the things
that i've done
up to this point that i might be the
only person in the world who can say
that out loud
do you know anybody else who's saying
this that the black lives matter
the trigger of it i'm not saying racism
doesn't exist
i'm not talking about the the larger
questions that's another topic
but just the question of police killing
black people
at a at an oversized alarming amount
it just isn't true now when i change the
frame to
why is it that you don't hear any
engineers scientists or statisticians
uh being on the same side as the black
lives matter protest
the reason is these are all the groups
that know how to look at data
and there's a very simple data analysis
mistake
which caused all these protests and it's
this
they looked at the percentage of black
people killed
versus the percentage of white people
killed
by police and that's just a data
analysis error
because when you look at the percentage
of black people killed by police
you're not really looking at police
violence against black people
what you've done is you've accidentally
studied
how many black people commit crimes or
how many black people
live in a neighborhood that's a high
crime neighborhood you've accidentally
looked at the wrong thing because police
are stopping
black citizens at a higher rate why
well most of it because it's the
neighborhood they live in is higher
crime and
you know certainly there's a it's a
separate issue
of whether uh too many black people are
being stopped and frisked
the stop and frisk part is a i think its
own topic
but the correct way to look at it is in
the total number of stops
police encounters what percentage of
them
either black people were stopped were
killed versus the percentage of white
people killed
when they were stopped by police now
that would be the correct way to look at
the data and when you do there's not
much difference
in fact white people are killed a little
bit more often but not statistically
so so the entire
protests are built on this weird little
lie
that can only be supported so long as
you never have in the news
an engineer a statistician
an economist or what's the third thing a
scientist
somebody who actually knows how to look
at data
you will never see somebody who knows
how to look at data
talk about this data because it would
ruin the whole thing
as soon as as soon as you talked about
it now what that means
and if you take this to the larger thing
compare
the issue of black people being killed
by police
which i think we'd all agree we want
less of it right so if there's anything
we can do to make less of that
i'm all on board all right i'm
completely on board with looking at new
ways to do
policing without police i think that's
actually a really good
path to explore but the only way i would
do it is by testing as small
to make sure it doesn't blow something
up right so
if if you wanted to replace police
and the way that you wanted to do it
is with some alternate methods let's
test them
totally let's test them see see what
happens but do a small
see if finding out if it works but
here's my
issue with the black lives matter
protest over police killing
police killing might be not might be
probably is not probably is absolutely
is i'm going to go for
full certainty on this the smallest
problem in the black community
it's the smallest problem why are they
protesting over their smallest problem
the total number of people killed by
police in general
that's your smallest problem do you know
what's a big problem
how about uh health care for black
people in general
how about that yeah that's a way bigger
problem
health care for black people in general
on a scale of
1 to 10 that's like a 10.
if you were to say on a scale of 1-10
where is number of people
killed by the police black people killed
by the police during police stops
that's a two one or a two
on the scale of one to ten just because
there's so few people involved
how about a good education for black
people
you know better education especially in
the inner cities areas
where is that on a scale of one to ten
ten
ten that is ten and if the scale was
higher
it would be higher it's not anywhere
close to the problem of police killing
black people during
stops not even close you know that one's
a two
education is a 10. what are the
democrats trying to do
reduce the ability of black people to
get a good education
by removing school choice which is
literally the only way to fix it
nobody even has another idea really it's
the only way
so the black population has
by um and i think that the illegitimate
press
is largely to blame for this imagine a
world in which
uh there were cons the protests were
happening just the way they're happening
now
but if you turned on cnn they would say
you know this is actually your smallest
problem
statistically if you're just to look at
the numbers
this is by far your smallest problem
because all of the crime
etc is coming from the same one thing
you know bad education uh there's there
are questions about family structure etc
which i don't fully understand what's
behind all of that
i've got some real questions there uh
about
you know what is actually exactly behind
the number of single parents etc
i'd like to know more about that but um
anyway if the news accurately reported
things in the size that they should be
reported
the protest wouldn't be happening
because every every time they turned on
the news they'd be watching their own
news source and their own news source
would say okay they're working on the
smallest problem and ignoring the big
ones again
and then all the protesters would say
well that's not any fun
why are we out here working on our
smallest problems again
did you know this was our smallest
problem you didn't know either okay but
now we know
because it's on both the left and the
right news sources
which is usually more dependable if it's
reported both ways
so in my opinion the protests and all
that come with it including the extra
coronavirus
if in fact there is any that comes out
of it
is entirely the illegitimate press's
problem when i told you that non-fiction
writers are the biggest risk to the
country i mean this
this is all non-fiction writers who are
writing fiction
ironically the the news business is just
non-fiction writers that's what they do
they write about non-fiction
and if they wrote correctly and if they
were good at their job
in other words if their talent stack
included the ability
to look at data they would not be
putting us in this position
do you know what they'd be doing
supporting things that would give black
people a better education
right because that would be the top
priority not even
close not even close to any of this
other stuff
all right um we found out
recently that uh mark levin you know him
from fox news and he's got a radio show
i believe and
other things and apparently a former
wikipedia
wikipedia editor and if you know the the
model of wikipedia you have all these
volunteer editors
so for every topic you could have
multiple editors
who have been sort of approved i guess
to be able to change things
but the editors can get in battles so
somebody could
change something and then another editor
can come in and change it back
but they do have rules about
what is right to change and what is not
right
to change and one of the rules is if you
point to a source
then you can keep it in there like you
don't want to remove something that has
a legitimate source
uh but if you put something in there
that's a claim without a source
then another editor can successfully get
rid of that
but apparently there was this a huge
battle over
mark levin's page in which somebody kept
filling it with
untruths and the other editors would try
as hard as they can to scrub it out
but i guess it was just like a raging
multi-year battle
in which somebody continued to put
smears on there and other people
continued to try to get rid of them
i don't know where it ended up i'm not
sure if it's back to the smear or back
to
gone all right
um
uh oh i accidentally talked about that
before
all right there's a tweet that says that
uh from
uh dr uh call vinder
cower so dr cower
i think i'm pronouncing it right k-a-u-r
uh tweeted that there are 53 plus
published hydroxychloroquine studies
for covet 19 uh showing strong efficacy
as a prophylaxis and as treatment in
early coven
um so that's the claim the claim that
there are 53
plus published studies showing that
hydroxychloroquine works
and that the government is sort of you
know blocking it from being used
and then on top of that uh dr zielinski
who most of you know he was the doctor
who is using hydroxychloroquine
with all of his patients in new york and
claimed
a much better much better rate of
recovery than other people like much
much better
so he's one of the leading proponents of
hydroxychloroquine now here the first
thing
the first thing you need to know is in
my understanding there is no
gold standard test of this drug yet
so you can fact check me on that but i
don't believe there is any controlled
clinical uh you know gold standard study
using it as a prophylaxis but
there do seem to be studies showing that
if you give it to people
when they're almost ready to die it
doesn't help much
so we've seen those as someone suggested
and i think
i have to agree it has the look of
intentional failure
the studies on hydroxychloroquine look
to the untrained eye just an observer
looking on
like they were designed to fail because
from day one
the the uh the potential of the drug was
always about giving it to you early
that was always the claim but what got
tested first
what got tested first is giving people
uh
toxic doses more than you would ever
give somebody
when they were at the end of their life
and it was just too late
now if you were going to design a study
to test the claim
that a drug given early as a as a
preventative prophylaxis
or at least to catch things early if you
were going to test that claim
would you do it by a toxic dose
given to people who are near death you
wouldn't
but suppose you were a big drug company
and you wanted to make sure that people
did not think hydroxychloroquine would
work
what would what kind of study would you
fund
if you wanted the public to think
hydroxychloroquine which is
cheap and widely available is not the
way to go
well if i were a drug company i would
immediately fund a trial that i knew
wouldn't work
and it would look exactly like the
trials that we saw
now this is not uh i'm not claiming
that's what happened i don't have any
information that would suggest that that
happened
but i'm saying that if you're looking at
it from the outside and you're even a
little bit objective
it looks like doesn't mean it happened
looks like it was designed to get you
the wrong result
i know what a i know what a trial would
look like if somebody's trying to get
an accurate good useful result and it's
the opposite of that
right yeah i'm seeing in the comments
that you say it sounds like that's
exactly what happened
we can't say that's what happened but we
can say it looks exactly like it
so but i want to make a comment on
zielinski
as well he tweeted out recently uh
some data showing the different outcomes
the death rates
for various countries and he had them
sorted by whether they used
hydroxychloroquine early
or they didn't now at the bottom of the
list was the united states where it is
not commonly used
early it's only used too late and the
death rate was very high
and then the one at the top of the list
they were using it early
and the death rate was very very low
compared to the united states not even
close i mean way way difference
and then as you go down the list you get
down to countries
that also use hydroxycholera queen early
they also have way lower death rate than
the united states
so so far that's consistent right
so all the people with
hydroxychloroquine are having good
results
according to this one chart and the
united states isn't is getting bad
result
but here's the problem if you look at
the best people using hydroxychloroquine
compared to the ones who are getting the
worst result
but are also using it in the same way
early
there's a gigantic difference it's like
a 10 times difference
so even the even the countries that
reportedly are using it early
there's something like a 10 times
difference in their outcomes
what does that tell you it tells me it's
not the hydroxychloroquine
but that chart was supposed to tell you
that it
took the chloroquine which one of us is
right
so dr zielinski obviously knows more
about
all of this than i do but the chart that
he presented to make his case
to me because i spend more time looking
at data you know i used to do it for a
living i've got a
economics background etc but when i look
at the data that he presented
it says to me it's not the
hydroxychloroquine
it says that if you can have a 10 times
difference
using it there's something else going on
there's probably something
that some of these countries have in
common beyond that
so that doesn't mean it doesn't work i'm
just saying that
i i'm not convinced and i'm going to
stick with my 30
chance it's a game changer which is a
strong chance
you know 30 is pretty solid chance but
it's less than half
right so i'm still on the side that if
we were to do a controlled
clinical style a gold standard
scientific test
that there's two to one chance you won't
find it works
all right but a 30 chance you will now
if it turns out
that it works will you say that i was
wrong
you should not because you should
remember that i just put odds on it
and if something goes the 30 way versus
the
60 something percent way it doesn't mean
i'm right or wrong
because the only thing i could be right
and wrong about was assigning the
percentages
and i've given room for it to go either
way all right
i've talked too much i've gone too long
so i think i'll end it here
somebody says you mess it up bro about
what
yeah i see in your comments you're
asking about whether zinc is included or
not included
i've seen lots of contradictory studies
i've seen studies that say it's not the
zinc
i've seen studies that say it is the
zinc i've seen
studies that say no no it's not the zinc
it's the azithromycin
and so there are studies that have both
zinc and azithromycin
and hydroxychloroquine and then you say
well that worked
but was it the azithromycin that some
people say is the active ingredient or
was it the zinc or was it the
combination of the two or the
combination of the three
those are all the things we don't know
and it's a lot
all right and i will talk to you
tomorrow
