I want to I want to toss out a uh
explanation
for the division in the country
all right and it's one you haven't heard
before I tested it out on my man cave
live stream last night got a good
response so I'm going to try it again
and it goes like this if you if you uh
talk to somebody in person
How likely are you in 2023 to want to
get into a political conversation
I'm going to answer the question for you
while I watch your answers
probably close to zero because you know
that in 2023 if you get into a political
conversation with somebody whose views
you don't already know now if it's
somebody who's really close to you and
you already know their views and you're
just saying something you know they're
going to agree with that's fine
but you would not enter a let's say a
cocktail party without knowing the
people
and launch into a political conversation
because your odds of you know they're
being on your side or you know 25 or
something so people will stay away from
the person all right now let me turn
that into a mechanical process
so I described it on a social conceptual
level now I'm going to turn it into a
machine
what what would be your experience if
you got into a political conversation
and it turned ugly
you would produce cortisol
your body would produce cortisol and
that makes you feel bad
because it'd be tense
so tension makes you feel bad and trains
you not to do it so that's why we don't
do it in person
now let's go to social media
when I see a tweet from Rob Reiner
and I think you know I bet I could make
my followers laugh with this clever
cutting rejoinder
and they'll send my little you know
little post
and I'll get a bunch of you know
positive reinforcement retweets and
hearts and I'll get a I'll get a bump of
dopamine
so when I'm in person I don't cause
Division I just get along with everybody
because I don't want cortisol and that's
my only option it well the risk right I
mean maybe I could find somebody
like-minded but I'm not going to take
the risk of a cortisol like cluster bomb
that I created for myself
but online it's nothing but dopamine
so I'm like I don't mean uh addicted
it's just an addiction
so the division in the country is not an
in-person division
we all know that
we all know the division is fake
because we only do it online
if you put me in person with anybody you
could you could drop me into a crowd of
the most rabid you know Democrat
anti-trumpers and if they didn't ask me
any political questions and let's say
they didn't recognize me I could get
along fine
I wouldn't have the slightest problem
in a in an event where every single
person was a progressive I wouldn't have
any problem I could easily get along
with them
make permanent friends
but as soon as you put me online I'm
just a dopamine fiend
so when we're talking about the division
if you want to talk about the division
conceptually and who said what you get
nowhere you you don't get any
understanding what's happening uh you
know if you ask most people what's
causing the division what would they say
well the other side duh I'll tell you
who's causing the division it's those
people I'm getting my dopamine here
insulting the people that I'm getting uh
my rocks off from insulting they are the
cause but I might as well enjoy it abuse
I might as well enjoy mocking them
because I didn't cause it like I'm not
it's not me but of course it's you
you're getting your dopamine hit they're
getting their dopamine hit
it's dopamine
so as long as there's a dopamine reward
for division you get more of it but as
soon as you walk out the door to the
real world you can't get that hit
is simply not available to you so you go
into a different chemical uh cost
benefit analysis you go well I don't
want any cortisol and that's the only
thing available because I get in some
stupid fight that I don't need
so every time you fall into the Trap
that the people on you the other side of
you politically are broken problem you
know monsters and they must be defeated
just remember that's your addiction
talking
that's your addiction talking it's just
like if you were unfentanyl and you had
an opinion that the fentanyl had given
you like oh it doesn't really hurt me
you know whatever the fentanyl tells you
to think
right so you the pair it's it's just the
dopamine that's making you talk once you
realize this is a reframe by the way by
the way if you didn't know
I wrote an amazing best-selling book
that you can buy right now in all its
forms pretty soon we'll have the
hardcover uh in in days
um
so here's the reform the reframe is
you're addicted to dopamine there is no
division in the country
and you know when I said that the the
DeSantis people are coming after me
uh with like weird you know just
flailing claims about Vivek that don't
pan out in my opinion uh
I don't feel bad about them and I don't
feel that they're my enemies because you
know I would be perfectly happy with the
president DeSantis
uh they're definitely not on the other
team for me but at the moment they're
acting out and the acting out to me
looks like they're they're desperately
searching for dopamine because they're
having a they're having a negative well
probably a dopamine
disadvantage because they're candidates
not killing it right now and Vivek is so
if you see it as some people having a
dopamine emergency that they were all
happy that oh I I picked the right one
this time
imagine I mean I guess I have to imagine
it because I didn't do it imagine if I
thought DeSantis was going to carry me
over the the line to Victory
and then it just all fell apart where it
looks like it's falling apart you
wouldn't feel good
and you'd probably act out and that's
what we're seeing
so
just remember
you're an addict you're not somebody who
has division with anybody in the country
