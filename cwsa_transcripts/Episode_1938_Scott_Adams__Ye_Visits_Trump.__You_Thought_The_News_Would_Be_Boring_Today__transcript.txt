Papa
good morning everybody
and welcome to the highlight of
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams and today is a special Black
Friday Edition
and if you'd like to take your Black
Friday up to oh levels we've never seen
before all you need is you know what you
need all you need is a cupboard mug or a
glass a tanker chalice is dying a
canteen jogger flask a vessel of any
kind tell me with your favorite liquid I
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine here the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now go
yeah that's that's the good stuff right
there
wow
so today is uh as you know Black Friday
um
it's a little bit racist because uh when
do white people get to shop
I mean how come white people don't have
a day to shop
why why is it only black what oh oh
black I'm sorry it turns out that Black
Friday
has nothing to do with race
I'm just so tuned to everything being
about race
I just think a white sale is for white
people and
black Fridays for black people and if
you try to shop at the black and white
store you better not go on the day that
isn't your day let me tell you do you
shop at the black and white store
yeah Wednesdays white people
Thursdays black people
every other day you have to make sure
you don't go in the wrong Bay no I'm
making that up it's not true none of
that is true everything I said is not
true
and that's how we play
the holidays
well there may be a story that you
noticed was anybody smart enough not to
check the news before you came on is
there anybody who doesn't know the news
about Mar-A-Lago and Trump
oh perfect oh perfect I'm so happy
there's somebody who doesn't know the
news
because I'm not sure you're going to
believe it
you might actually not even believe the
news I'm going to tell you what
is reported to have happened
what's reported to happen is that yay
visited Mar-A-Lago and had dinner with
Trump
that part seems to be true so yay
reports and reports details about it
now uh apparently
the reporting and and uh credit to uh
Tim Poole I think Tim cast
probably got the exclusive on this
uh so check that out so check check Tim
pools the Tim cast website so give him
some credit for the for the scoop
um I think it's a scoop I think I think
it's a good one too
so
here's what we know Kanye did not go
alone
he brought Milo yiannopoulos
and Nick Fuentes
and somebody didn't know before who was
worked on Trump's election in 2016 for
Florida I guess did a good job for
Trump's campaign Karen giorno
now
it's very important to the story
that you know the cast of characters to
try to figure out what's going on here
and then I'll tell you what happened at
the dinner the dinner didn't go well
according to yay
all right so bye bringing the um this
Karen Giorno the thinking is that he's
signaling his seriousness for running
for president because she's a serious
player people respect her for campaigns
so that's the first part of the play
the second part of the play is that two
people who brought Milo yiannopoulos as
potentially his campaign manager I don't
know if that's confirmed or just
something he said
and you're going to have to look up Nick
Fuentes on your own
can you do that for me this story
doesn't make sense unless you do your
own research now the reason I'm not
going to describe him to you is that I
don't want to be on record describing
him
and if you do enough research you'll
know why
all right
he has he has a lot of supporters
so if I were to describe him in a way
that they did not like they they swarm
you they're called gripers
so he actually has a very active
community of people who will uh who will
visit you in an aggressive way
uh in a variety of ways if you said
something that was not to their liking
so instead of saying that I would ask
you to do your own research
so whatever you want to think about them
uh the only clue I'll give you
is if Kanye had two choices
no I can't do it I can't do it
okay this is the only clue I'm going to
give you
if Kanye wanted to get rid of the
impression
that he was anti-Semitic this would be
the worst way you would do it
which is not a statement about Fuentes
right so I'm not making a statement
about Fuentes I'm saying that if
yea's intention was to someday get rid
of that anti-Semitism claim this would
be the very worst way you could do it
the very worst way in fact most people
hearing the story would say oh
I guess we were totally right
about what we were thinking about yay
so
let's assume there's more to the story
than we know so far because I'm pretty
sure that's true we're still in that fog
of War phrase there's going to be some
more surprises coming out of this
but what you need to know is that if
Trump had known
uh if Trump had known who yay was
bringing with him and I think the
reporting is a little unclear he may not
have known and may not have actually
been sitting with or having dinner with
Fuentes I'm not sure because there were
multiple tables at there so I'm not sure
if he even talked to Fuentes Trump
himself so
the first question is
uh did yeah was Jared there that's a
good question I don't he wasn't at the
table
but that's a good question
now apparently halfway through the meal
or halfway through the meeting or
whatever Trump was called away took a
phone call
and then came back and the entire tone
of the meeting changed and it was clear
that Trump was just trying to get them
the hell out of there
uh and I guess Trump said something
about Kim Kardashian that was a little
nasty
and yay he took that wrong because he
was like uh that's the mother of my
children
that didn't go well yay says he asked
Trump to be his vice presidential
running mate
he's yay says that didn't go well but uh
you know presumably Trump took that as
not serious
here's what I think
I think there's somebody
called Trump out of the room to tell him
that uh Fuentes was in the room Maybe
so somebody may have said you you just
got sandbagged by who's in your room so
you've got some people there that you
you need to disassociate with so
somebody might have clued in Trump that
there was somebody else in the
associated area he wasn't aware of Maybe
maybe so that's just speculation
all right so
uh
so what do you make of the fact
the yay is acting seriously enough about
his run that he he actually convinced a
serious Florida campaign manager to
attend with him
and that she was also convinced to
attend with Milo
who if you don't know Milo
yiannopoulos's background I'd ask you to
do a little research on him as well
because I'm not gonna
I'm not going to insult or defend any of
these characters I'll just tell you that
if you wanted to be president those
would be your two most interesting
choices
like you it's almost like
you would almost think yay was trying to
make sure he never had a good reputation
again
right now that's not a comment
about who he brought that's a comment
about
how it will be seen
right so I'm not going to give you my
opinion on any of it I'll just say
that's how it will be seen it'll be seen
as
almost mental illness somebody said in
the comments it almost looks like mental
illness
except how do you how does the mental
ill guy
get all those three people to go to
marlaco
there's something else going on
all right here's what I think
I think
I think EA just decapitated Trump
because even though the reporting might
come out that Trump didn't really know
who was going to show up
it will always be reported that Trump
had some kind of dinner with these folks
so the left has the perfect uh take
Trump angle this is basically
um
the the fine people hoax it's just that
because all you have to do is tell the
story out of context and he's over
and the added context is did he know
that who is in the room
my guess is there's very little chance
he would have allowed that
if he knew because I think he did know
you know he did know the characters he
probably knew who the people I don't
think he would have allowed it
because it would have been insane right
so here's what I think
I think that EA has a backer who is
trying to take Trump out
and he sent a little uh poison pill into
Mar-A-Lago to end Trump's viability
and that yay
may not have been exactly on that page
yea might just be thinking he's running
for president and getting some help from
some powerful people behind the curtain
so somebody behind the curtain put him
together with those two characters
in a normal World yea doesn't meet
Milo maybe Milo but he doesn't meet Nick
Fuentes they don't run in the same
circles there's a Matchmaker here
so when you find the Matchmaker
like the the find the one person who
knows all three of those people
Milo Fuentes and Karen giorno
if you find who knows those three people
you'll probably know more about this
situation
but it looks like it was a uh it looks
like it was to take out Trump
what do you think
because I can't see another reason for
it it just looks like it was a
you know he was trying to take him out
now suppose Trump suppose yay actually
runs
uh and he actually you know gets on the
ballot who knows anything could happen
um I don't think he's gonna fund it
enough to get out of the ballots I don't
know but suppose he does
could yay change the vote enough
that he becomes the king maker
could ye be the one who decides who wins
by just being one who could siphon off
two percent from either side
and could his endorsement in the end
let's say you know let's assume assume
he gets five percent of the vote or
something and in polls and then at the
end he has to withdraw
but you know he puts his support behind
somebody would that matter
probably probably not
I don't I don't think his endorsement
would make any difference
[Music]
but it's the most interesting story and
I can't imagine that it happened
organically now here's some more
speculation I don't believe that yay
knows much about Nick Fuentes
what do you think
do you think that yay was actually fully
aware
of Nick's background
because if he did know his background
that would suggest that he's actually
intentionally doing an anti-jewish
campaign
who would do that
but then I would ask who would say what
yay is already said in public I don't
know anybody who would do that
well who's the basketball player who did
I guess there is at least one other
person who would do it
yeah Fuentes is obscure for now somebody
saying Nick Fuentes is obscure or Kyrie
yeah so Kyrie Irving's maybe the other
person who do it but we're in strange
territory where you can't rule out
things just because it sounds crazy
if you had told me a week ago yeah yay
will pick Milo yiannopoulos as his
campaign manager I would have ruled that
out as obviously crazy well that's
obviously crazy
but it appears to to be happening if you
told me that those three would go
together to Mar-A-Lago one week ago I
would have said no no that's not going
to happen that's crazy
but it happened apparently it happened
so
I'm not sure what you can rule out what
can you rule out in anymore if that
happens
how many of you let's see let's take the
two hypotheses you'll see take the
temperature of the room I'm going to
read the room a little bit here
how many of you think it was exactly
what it looked like and Trump allowed
those three people who he understood
were coming to come to Mar-A-Lago how
many think is exactly what it looks like
on the surface
mostly nose
there's more to it right all right how
many believe that yea knew exactly the
full nature of the people he was
bringing with him or the full
accusations against the Middle East
it's Bex some of you think yay knew and
some of you think he did not know
yeah could be either way
now there's there's another possibility
here which is really interesting
really interesting
if if yay continues with his um
maybe it's a strategy I don't know but
if it's a strategy suppose yay just
collects everybody who's been canceled
but cancel it for different reasons you
know pick somebody who's like uh looks
racist against white people but also
pick somebody who's been accused of
being you know racist against somebody
else
you know just all the people have been
accused of the worst things you know
Milo has been accused of you know
underage
let's say promotion of underage stuff at
the gay community I don't know if that's
a good way to characterize it uh I don't
want to carry that's why I don't want to
talk about them because I don't want to
get into the accusations that's that's
the part where I don't want to be
I just saw a funny meme go by on locals
well I don't know what to make of this
story in my opinion you will find out
how this Matters by watching how Fox
News covers it
now you've noticed I think you've seen a
reporting that Murdoch owns Fox News and
Wall Street Journal and
uh what in the Post New York Post that
he's sort of anti-trump this time
so will they treat the story like it's a
big story because it's got these
interesting elements to it or will they
ignore it
because think of this if they cover the
story it would probably be for the
purpose of taking Trump out
right if if uh if Fox covers it as oh
Trump made this huge mistake and now
he's out he can't possibly win because
he associated with people that you know
will be easy targets for the left
or will they ignore it
will they ignore it and how does Fox
News ignore this story
how do you ignore it have they ignored
it so far let's check
all right I'll open let's open the Fox
News app
I haven't done this yet
so we'll see
so clearly it's wouldn't you say it's
the biggest story
yeah somebody's saying Paul Ryan is on
the board of Fox News all right so
uh so I'll just I'll just look at the
headlines all right so there's a shooter
thing a lost hiker thing and the Elon
Musk thing or musk things another
shooting thing
uh something about guns
nope
I'm going going going
uh it's not a story
so so Fox News is treating it as it
doesn't exist
oh it's not a story
and so if I hadn't read it on I guess
it's on the hill but I think the hill
got it from Tim Poole's reporting
I if we didn't have podcasts or
podcasters well give me a fact check on
this all right here's the fact check
would this even be a story
if Cassandra Fairbanks had not written
about it
in on on the timcast website
because because then I think the hill
picked it up and then Twitter saw it
MTG saying she might be on the ticket
that's interesting
somebody says it's yay being yay are you
sure it happened no yeah there are
photographs of all the people in the
room
but it's like a blurry photo it's
possible that the
no I think there is a reporting that
Fuentes was there I think there's enough
reporting to say that happen
anyway uh Milo is working for MTG you
say I don't know about that photoshop
yeah it could be Photoshop could be just
somebody else it was somebody with
sunglasses on
move along this is nothing it might be
maybe it's a whole nothing and one of
the things I always liked about Trump is
that he ran a pirate ship
you know his pirate ship was anybody who
wants to help support him it's like okay
you're a pirate
but you can get on
okay where is that
um yeah
Milo uh was full of trump with Tim cast
just weeks ago
yeah all right well let's talk about
Twitter the other most interesting story
in the world
um
apparently Elon Musk has confirmed that
there were no notable uh leftists who
were ever banned on on Twitter for
anything
and he's confirmed that basically he was
a nest of San Francisco and Berkeley
uh opinions that they were just they
were imposing themselves on the world
which is exactly what you thought it was
have you ever been this right about
anything
like normally you know to me this is
like finding out that the uh the 69
moonwalk was actually faked or something
it would be you know there would be a
whole bunch of people would say that's
exactly what it looked like to me
I don't believe it was faked by the way
that's not my belief but but does it
I don't know it's almost two on the nose
isn't it it's so obviously true and then
it's confirmed
I didn't really expect it I expected
what we would find
was that there were a few people who
were had found a way to put their finger
on the scales and maybe the other people
were a little bit unaware of it
but it looks like it was a cultural fact
that they were just suppressing uh
conservative opinion
somebody's asking about Jack Dorsey I
think he was just running two
corporations and it was hard to weed out
you know we don't the what was going on
below the below the hood I think
probably I think it was just hard to
figure out what was going on there and
maybe hard to fire the people who needed
to be fired
uh but apparently Elon Musk didn't have
that problem he's firing anybody needs
to be fired
and I guess a a left-leaning
um Twitter account has been finally
suspended
so
a leftist was suspended for uh
essentially death threats against
Libs of tick tock and Matt Walsh and
gays against groomers and some other
people and Tim Poole Tim Poole's in the
news a lot
so
uh
so I could not be happier about Twitter
is Twitter the the thing that's most
going right in the world right now
and you know this this whole thing we
talked about how Twitter is like a
cybernetic brain
if you get your cybernetic brain right
it looks like musk is on the way of
doing that like that that fixes a lot
doesn't it because I don't think you
know I've said this before but it's
worth repeating because you're not
seeing the full effect yet when the 2024
race gets under full uh full speed
the mainstream media won't be able to
lie like it did
because as long as Twitter was covering
the LIE they could say anything but now
Twitter won't cover the lies
Twitter will be exposing the lies
what will the mainstream media do
because they've evolved into you know a
propaganda
propaganda platforms can they can they
pivot in time and actually do news
oh
um
so what else we got going on
so I'm watching with uh like weird
interest
that the the Democrats who are
um
experience what I'm going to call
Twitter failure porn have you seen it
yet
people on the left who are anti-musk and
now anti-twitter
and they're they're they're they're
tweeting with Glee about what they see
is the potential you know complete
destruction of Twitter oh it's not going
to last and I watched in the beginning
it started this way
oh 75 of the staff is going to quit he's
in so much trouble
and then you then slowly it starts
Dawning on you wait a minute he has
successfully replaced the entire
marketing department
by just waiting and business is up so
slowly say okay okay granted there may
have been a few too many people at
Twitter like the marketing department
okay that's a special case but that's
not like the story of what's happening
this is one Department yes yes he can
replace one whole department just by
tweeting but that says one Department
and then you say to yourself but you
know those Engineers are leaving too
and then you realize that Twitter
upgraded features is is rapidly
iterating and is already better and has
gotten rid of a pedophile uh hashtags
and you say to yourself okay okay it's
possible that the engineers who left
were not the The A-Team
it looks like maybe the people were
there had fewer people to get in the way
and they just got some business done
really quickly
in a hardcore way just the way it must
set so okay okay yes yes special case he
doesn't need marketing and I'll give you
I'll give you the he doesn't need every
single engineer but man
that you know what about his debt I mean
his dad is going to crush him I mean
there's no way he's going to pay for all
that okay if you get rid of half or 75
percent of your employees and it is by
far the greatest part of your expense
space yes it turns out you could
actually make it a cash faucet by doing
the things that musk is doing
and probably if if business stays good
the advertisers will slowly come back so
okay maybe it's not a it's not a
financial mess right so yeah he does
need marketing I'll give you that and
it's maybe he's found a way to make it a
little bit profitable but you know how
is that going to work when all the
engineers are leaving okay maybe it was
only the bad Engineers are leaving
today
this is where it got all the way to
today
as of today this is this is all they
have left for their uh Twitter and
failure porn
Robert Reich tweets this
here's why Elon Musk fails to understand
much of a corporation's value lies in
their workers their knowledge skills and
ideas when he fired half of Twitter's
Workforce he draw he drove off even more
he wasn't quote cutting costs he was
actively destroying what he bought
and it's attached to an article about or
at least Wall Street Journal has an
article today I forget if he attached it
but Wall Street Journal has an article
that
Twitter might be having problem with all
of their Regulatory Compliance because a
lot of the Regulatory Compliance people
left
it's all the way down to well we're not
sure that the people left in the
Regulatory Compliance group can cover
all the work
have they had a problem so far no
no no no
they have not had a problem that we're
aware of I mean nobody's suing them or
anything like that so apparently you
could just get rid of everybody now what
about Robert Wright's writes a point do
you believe that Twitter was really the
real value is in the workforce and now
having gutted so much of the workforce
he's he's removed the hearts from
Twitter
the beating heart has been removed from
Twitter
all right well Robert Wright I believe
taught at the business school where I
got my business degree at Berkeley
and uh
that's not exactly what I learned in
Business School
this wasn't exactly you know the version
of business that I learned
the version of business I learned goes
like this
you can get rid of half of any any group
you could get rid of half of any group
if it's a mature group you can get rid
of half of them you'll be fine
that's what I learned I I learned that
your groups become bloated over time
You Know Jack Dorsey sounded directly he
grew too fast
you said it directly he said that's on
him
so all I see is that he cut the dead
weight and he's you know redoing the
business model and everything looks like
it's going to be fine he was actually
musk was actually mocking people saying
wasn't Twitter supposed to be dead by
now it was you know more traffic than
ever
well here's a story that it's a good
thing it came out on Black Friday so
that uh it wouldn't get much news
coverage
but apparently uh the Biden
Administration is very close to
approving uh
a Chevron deal in Venezuela to pump a
lot of oil in Venezuela
now you might say to yourself Scott
why don't we just
pump more oil in the United States
because oil is oil
and why wouldn't we just keep the money
in the United States and pump our own
oil why would we let somebody who maybe
uh
communist you know hell hole why would
we help them when we've been sanctioning
them well here's what you don't know
that sweet sweet Venezuelan oil that's
not like American oil that American oil
is that's like climate change
like you get some of that on you
you put that in your car
the entire planet just starts
disintegrating I mean the atmosphere of
the planet would actually if you could
see it from space you'd see us starting
to crinkle in
that's the American Oil you put some of
that Venezuelan oil that's green oil
that is green green oil you can actually
put a straw in it and drink it it's like
it's that green now I don't know if this
has confirmed yet but there are Lobster
reports of people rubbing the Venezuelan
crude oil on their body
to cure covid
covered yeah covet is completely cured
now this is not it wasn't a randomized
controlled trial but observationally I
think there's some strong observational
data that if you rub and you have to get
it all over your body
some people make the mistake I was like
oh I'll rub a little of that that is
well include on my back or my chest and
then I'll cure my coven now
you have to practically dunk yourself in
it like you've got to get it all the way
under the fingernails you've got it goes
the covet the covet can get in and out
you know from the smallest hole so
you've got to completely cover yourself
with crude and uh
so far there's
um
I don't know if you've heard this but
there has not been one coveted death in
Venezuela from someone who covered their
body with crude oil
zero
now if you tell me that's a coincidence
I'll tell you what have you been smoking
because that is something called science
science if a lot of people have covered
themselves with crude oil and then also
died from covid I'd say well
I'm not going to trust that as a covert
cure but zero people have covered
themselves entirely with Venezuelan oil
died of covid I'd say that's
well that's science
um Occam's razor right there
so that's all good news
um at the same time
weirdly
apparently there's this massive oil
refinery that got approved 30 miles off
the coast of Texas that would add 2
million barrels per day of export
capacity for the U.S
now
if you're following your energy
stories
you have Biden not allowing Americans to
drill more oil
but maybe approving the Venezuelans to
create oil
but we're building a massive export
refinery
to export the massive amount of oil that
we can't drill for
all right it's all like confusing it's
all confusing yeah it's actually for
export
all right here's what I really think
I I think the Ukraine war has always
largely been a war to
steal Russia's energy business
that's what I think I I think this was
always a pickpocket War
that the Russia was too strong with
their energy business there were two
strong uh economically
and they were too strong militarily
because they were strong economically
and I think that between the fact that
our energy companies would like that
business and the fact that Russia was
getting too strong but they had one
point of failure
Russia's one point of failure is they
had one business you know the one main
business so some people said Russia is a
gas station with a nuclear weapons
that's sort of all they are a military
and an energy business well if you can't
beat them militarily
you can take them out of business and
then they can't fund their military
so I think what you're seeing is a
long-term you know maybe a neocon play
to Simply take Russia off the
geopolitical map
and it looks like it might work
the the only
Scott is given 10 different explanations
for different reasons for the war have I
have I
I what was my other reason
I don't believe I have
now I've reported that other people have
speculated Ukraine is a big money
laundering thing and you know and oh
lithium lithium lithium could be part of
it but remember lithium would be part of
the American energy companies
wanting to control energy
so it's very similar to wanting to put
Russia out of the energy business it's
all related
and yeah it may be about laundry money I
think corruption and laundry money may
be a big part of the story that's
possible
so
um
I feel as though
for how much we spent so far in Ukraine
what's our what's our cumulative price
tag is it I remember seeing 56 billion
but somebody said
200 billion 40 billion 70 billion now
yeah we're gonna we're probably gonna
pass 200 billion wouldn't you think
because eventually we end up you know
reconstruction and all that all let's
say it's 200 billion
do you think yeah if you knew in advance
that 200 billion would take Russia uh
just off the map in terms of something
we have to worry about
do you think that would be worth 200
billion
now it's also of course destroying
Ukraine so that's a separate question
can't be ignored
I don't know I I think that a lot of
people would argue that it's a good
investment
my my uh economics degree tells me it's
a good investment if it works if it
doesn't work it's the dumbest thing
anybody ever did right because if it
becomes nuclear war it's the worst thing
anybody ever did but there is a scenario
where the Biden Administration took
Russia completely off the geopolitical
map and replaced their energy business
with American Energy
at some point and
and we end up paying for it another in
other words
if American Energy replaced Russian
energy or some big portion of it that
would be enough of a stimulus to the
American economy forever
forever that it would pay for the 200
billion we are I'll bet our tax about
our tax
um collections over time
would pay for it it actually looks like
a reasonable investment now that's not a
reason to do it
I'm not saying you know go Ukraine and
go buy us some energy business I'm not
saying I approve it I'm saying it looks
like it could work
I know I'm not sure I would have said
that at the beginning
did not see that coming I'm not even
sure anybody saw it coming but I do more
and more I'm convinced that the Russian
military is at the point of total
collapse
now that might not be enough for Ukraine
to take back territory but it looks you
know and before you say it yes I
understand all of the reporting out of
the area is suspect nobody believes
anything out of the area but if Russia
were not at the point of collapse I
would expect them to be doing
um offensive offensive moves wouldn't
you
can you imagine the Russian military
being
still effective but only playing defense
and actually I believe somebody was
mocking them for saying that they're
only uh
their only successes that they've
claimed lately
are how quickly they uh they retreated
that Rush actually reported as a success
how rapidly they retreated from a
Ukrainian onslaught
like that really happened that's all
they had well we got a lot of people out
so if you don't hear about any Russian
offense except um taking out energy
plants
that all sort of suggests that their
military just stopped working
they might not have any offensive
capabilities at all except you know
shelling and drones and stuff
the Russians don't engage in winter
offensives
I'll give you that
but I'll bet it's more than that I think
at the end of the winter there won't be
much left because apparently the Ukraine
the Ukrainian weapons are more accurate
so they're just picking off have you
seen the videos of these small drones
uh dropping little bombs on troops
imagine being there dug in for the
winter as a Russian troop you know
you're freezing all winter long you
don't have enough to eat you know you
the bathroom is outdoors probably
and
and every day like every day
there's a drone that comes over and
drops the equivalent of a hand grenade
into every little group of you standing
around because those are the videos
we're seeing now now I don't know how
many drones they have that can drop a
hand grenade or a little omelet but they
have them I can't imagine anything that
would be more
destructive to morale
do you
like if you're being shelled that's
pretty scary
but you hide until the shelling stops so
if you have a good hole you're thinking
well
I'll probably not be killed because I'm
in this hole and I know the shelling's
happening
but if you don't know anytime you walk
outside if this little hand grenade is
going to drop from the sky
that would be super super scary
wouldn't it like the the psychological
impact of the drones dropping bombs on
every little collection of Russian uh
conscripts I don't I don't think there's
going to be much left of the Russian
army
um
so China's uh in trouble still their
economy uh they've got uh they're going
into more shutdowns
and that's going to create more uh maybe
supply chain problems
so Russia's economy is uh in the toilet
so Russia is doing poorly China's doing
poorly how's the United States doing
so here's the thing that I'm not sure
anybody has caught
when it comes to
um
military defense and everything else
that matters Whoever has the best
economy usually comes out ahead because
that's expensive stuff
the only thing the United States has to
do
is do better than China and Russia
that's what we have to do our economy
just has to be stronger than those two
and we end up still being the dominant
economy of the world and then we're in
fine shape and it looks like we have
gained compared to both of them it looks
like Russia will be degraded forever but
I don't see that for America
is going to have an inflation problem
for a long time but we can work through
it you know it's something we know how
to handle basically
um you know with great hardship but we
know how to do it and we have a lot of
debt but we also have the strongest
country
right if United States
went I don't know what's the equivalent
of bankrupt or whatever countries do it
would destroy the world
so so you need somebody who wants to
collect your money and put you in a
business before it can happen and
default yeah uh I think I think the
United States could default and it
barely change its its credit
because nobody else would be better you
know you'd still be better off
with a shaky American you know debt
situation than with somebody else's
better debt situation
all right so
um
I know this we we could be on the verge
of some
complete dominance by America in a way
that we've never seen before
at one point we used to think America
was the one superpower but you know at
least two others have some
they're they're they've got some nukes
that we have to worry about that are not
on our side
but I think we're going to go back to I
think we're going to go back to America
is the only superpower because it looks
like judge is in big trouble
all right here's what I need from my
government
I need for my government
something like this
some kind of a matrix that shows me what
industries have their Manufacturing in
China
and something to tell me what percentage
is flowing back to somewhere else could
be to Vietnam it doesn't have to be back
to America I would like to know how
exposed we are
and specifically for our key Industries
so I'd like to see for example I'd like
to see China has 80 percent of our big
Pharma production
but we've already brought back 10
percent
in the past two years because you know
we're we're trying to be less at risk
halfway
what if we brought back 10 already
that would that would give me hope that
we have this under control like maybe
it'll be 20 next year Etc what if it's
what if it's nothing
what if we've actually increased
Reliance on China I wouldn't know would
you know
I I don't know any reporting or metric
that says what percentage of our of our
total manufacturing is ending up in
China and whether it's even flowing in
our Direction
don't you think that's like a super
important number
has anybody ever seen that number
have you ever seen any reporting on that
or any attempt to report it
I feel as if the federal government
should maybe make that a reporting
requirement I hate government
requirements for reporting but given
that this is the most important number
other than employment you know maybe GDP
employment and then this
that's like third most important number
probably maybe
debt
um
but what do you like to know if
something is because remember Biden made
a big deal about how he was bringing
manufacturing back
so is he is he
and if the Republicans could find that
number and find out it isn't happening
quickly that would be a good Avenue of
attack I'd love to see the Republicans
and Democrats compete
compete on the question of uh you know
who could do a better job of
repatriating manufacturing
or at least moving it to another Shore
uh we're taking Germany's business
I don't know and I'd love also to see
more reporting on
um local manufacturing methods
especially 3D printing
because in theory we should be getting
to the point where the only thing you
have to move is the printing materials
you know the raw material that gets
printed into something eventually that's
the only thing you should have to move
everything else just gets made on site
so are we anywhere near that happening
yeah what about chips
does it make sense to you that we move
our chip manufacturing to Taiwan
I mean I realize we don't have a lot of
options but wouldn't that be the worst
place to move them
like if you said all right entire world
entire world where if we need to you
know have less Reliance on China
for those chips and we want to take that
shine the chips out of China where would
be the the worst place in the world to
put them
well how about in the place that China
plans to conquer in a year or two
how about that
how about that I don't even understand
that I mean it has to do with it
probably has to do with the fact that
Taiwan was the only one who could do
something quickly right
um see micro series on how America works
sounds interesting
sounds interesting all right
uh
stop calling for Musa Taiwan
uh are you a Chinese agent oh
do you know my my favorite Nemesis Jen
so Chen I forget his last name uh tweets
on uh he's on Twitter and he's always uh
listed by Twitter as uh Associated uh
like a government-associated news media
or something
uh and so that so he every time he
tweets everybody gets his tweet he sees
that he's according to Twitter maybe
associated with the Chinese government
and therefore not just an individual
tweeting but he is so to him good like
he is so good at tweeting in an American
in a way that works in America
like I gotta give it to him he's just
the best of this and even when I see him
working against the the interests of my
country he does it so well that I'm like
oh damn it that was a good one that was
a good one Chad mostly what he does is
he adds context
and the context is often true
so when America is uh criticizing you
know China for something he'll just drop
in some context about America to show
that we're now so clean and usually I
read and I go ah yeah well that's a good
point good point Chad so he's my
favorite nemesis
foreign
the Trump meeting Trump took a meeting
with a black man a gay a Hispanic and a
woman it was a diversity meeting
you know you know Trump could completely
explain it away
do you know Trump could completely
explain it away very I was actually
going to say that but you beat me to it
so I'll give you credit for for the idea
like I said the thing I liked about
Trump
is he ran a pirate ship
everybody was allowed to come in
and it's a it's a weirdly unsettling
feeling
to watch your president be open to all
the citizens
think about it you've never seen it
before he's the only president who will
take a meeting with Kim Jong-un
to uh Alice the woman who got into jail
early I forget Alice Johnson
so Trump trump
uh enthusiastically Embraces 100 of all
Americans
he he could actually spend that as you
should be more like me
or how about why don't you spend some
time talking to people you don't agree
with
it'd be good for you
imagine him saying that you make the
whole thing away go away say you know
what I feel like America would be better
if we all spend a little bit more time
with people we don't agree with how
about you do a little bit more of it
instead of asking me to do a little less
of it because I'll tell you if you if
I'm a president of the United States
remember the candidate and somebody
comes to me and says I've got something
to say
I'm going to listen
I'm going to listen I'm not going to say
I reject you for things you did in the
past I won't listen to your concerns
because then I'm calling favorites and
America is my favorite
so yes you can have your opinions about
anybody who who visits me but you know
if AOC wants a meeting I'll take it
if you know if Elon Omar well that's a
bad example
you know that's a bad example but he
could just say I meet with Nancy Pelosi
what do you think of her
I met with Chuck Schumer
I would meet with Adam Chef
yeah if uh
if Eric swallow wants a meeting I will
meet with him
and you just equate you just equate the
top uh Democrat Leaders with the A's
party of people
and just say yeah there's if if you
would simply remove everybody from your
uh understanding of the world you're not
going to have a good understanding of
the world
I would also say uh here's one I I plan
to use
sooner or later
I'm going to be in this situation where
I get photographed with or like there's
some uh
horrible person I get photographed with
and somebody's going to say oh
that that person's you know you're
endorsing them or that influence or you
know somehow their Badness is wiping off
on you here's my response
if you put me in a in a room with
anybody else
do you think I'm going to become more
like them
or they will become more like me
it's pretty good isn't it
and I'm not even going to answer the
question
I go I'm an expert on persuasion
you put me in a room with somebody I
disagree with what's the most likely
outcome
they will change
right so the person you say you don't
like that met with me just
hypothetically I'll say would you like
them to be different
would you like them to be maybe a little
more open-minded
because they probably were when they
left
so if so you probably want all the
people you don't like to meet with me
personally
because I'll fix them I'll make them
better
now the thing is that
what would you do with that
like that answer just shuts down the
whole thing doesn't it you you could
High Ground this situation and say you
all should spend more time with people
you disagree with and don't tell me that
one person who visited me is my opinion
now I I met with a thousand people this
year do you think they all agreed with
each other no which one is my opinion
because I met with them no I'm listening
to everybody that's that's my job I
listen to everybody
so yeah expect more of it not less
you're going to see some frightening
frightening meetings I'll be meeting
with leftists you don't like just
anybody
so you've got something to say
all right what's that uh trade with
China oh there we go trade with China by
year
it looks like our experts are growing uh
our Imports fell
from 2015 to 2020 but now it looks like
they're climbing up again but I don't
know I don't know is the big number the
number we want to look at or should we
be looking at the important industries
I think it's that
you know there are a whole bunch more
trolls in the last few days
does anybody notice that it seemed like
there were fewer Trolls but in the last
few days like a couple of tweets they're
just a clear troll activity
the troll activities are the ones who
don't do anything except insult you
personally
have you seen that because for a while
it seemed like they were gone and then I
had like three of them in one tweet that
just came in to insult me personally
and I I don't know
like what drives that behavior is that
organized
it always seemed organized
so so he says maybe our plan is to use
everybody else's oil until we're the
only ones with oil you know I've thought
about that
that's not crazy the only reason the
only reason that I don't think we're
doing that is that we're not really that
farsighted
oh holiday is less Tech staff to police
the trolls that's a good good theory
uh
yeah it's difficult to say anything is a
trend because of the pandemic you're
right
uh it's kids on oh that could be
that could be yeah it could be younger
people who would normally be in school
and
so they're just trolling that could be
but the comments don't look like young
people they look like somebody who knows
me well enough to
you know try to get at me
Maybe
all right I uh
I asked around I'd heard on Twitter that
I wanted to get a confirmation that
there's a heroin shortage
and that the heroin users are basically
all using Fentanyl
so I did a little bit of research and I
found out that at least locally uh the
heroin users have simply formed a
preference for Fentanyl
so at least locally the reason that
there's less heroin being used is that
fentanyl is completely available
easy to get
and
it gives you a
here's the phrase a stronger nod
so I don't know too much about doing
heroin or fentanyl but apparently you
want to sit there in a stupor
that's sort of the deal you just sort of
sit there in a stupor that you like but
you get a better stupor from the
Fentanyl
the risk is that it kills you
so there's there's far less margin with
the fentanyl than with the heroin both
can kill you
but the the fentyl is more of a hair
trigger but it's a better High
so we've reached the point where there's
nothing to compete with it now
you could say we'll give you free heroin
and the addicts would still say oh thank
you for that free heroine
I'd rather steal something and get the
good stuff
so we may we may already be past the
point where we can deal with it with
Alternatives we may have not really past
that point because once the addicts know
the fentanyl is the better High
there's nothing you could do to stop it
they're just they're not going to take
the Lesser High that's not a thing
yeah
so that's that's like a big that's a big
Fu to me because I thought maybe there
was some some angle in where we could
wean people into
still deadly but less deadly stuff that
doesn't look like a path at the moment
all right calling the herd yeah
yep I I do think we have to take the
assumption that the government is not
too serious about Fentanyl and the
reason is that they're not the citizens
they're trying to protect I don't think
the government wants to protect that
class of citizens and let me say it more
directly if the only people who are
dying of fentanyl were young women
we would have already bombed Mexico
there are plenty of young women dying
from fentanyl but we don't characterize
it that way it's probably still mostly
men isn't it
can somebody do a quick check I would
bet that the overdose drug rate is 70
male
what do you say 70 male
ODS does anybody have a sense for that
so that's just off the top of my head
what I imagine it would be
somebody do a quick check on that I'll
bet it's 70 to 80 male
so at least
I I conceive of it as more of a male
problem
and I think anything that kills mostly
young males is not considered a
um that big of a problem
it's just not that big of a problem in
America because we have plenty of uh
excess young men
who were not going to invent a microchip
I hate sad
but if you were losing your reproductive
you know group The Women exclusively we
would have already conquered Mexico we
wouldn't stand for that
yeah
now imagine if Kanye
does go ahead and run for president
and imagine he says he'll bomb the
cartels
what the hell am I going to do
vote for him
I'm not I'm not going to bother
supporting somebody I don't think could
win
but I'm going to have a dilemma if he
says he's going to bomb the cartels do
you know what else I would have a
dilemma with
if he said he was going to meet with the
cartel heads uh personally
because Cartier has something that Trump
has
and he's the only one Kanye could
actually have a meeting
with the heads of the cartels
am I right am I wrong
he could actually ask for a meeting and
actually have a sit down with the ads of
the cartels
I don't think anybody else could
yeah I mean Trump's the closest you can
get I don't think he could
and here's how you would the only way I
think you could get the cartels out of
the business is you would have to offer
them a cartel retirement plan
because the problem with being a cartel
leader is what
there's no retirement
the moment you say I'll be less of a
brutal killer
some brutal killer kills you and then
they take over your operation so they
can't really get out of the business
so I fantasize and this is Pure Fantasy
because I I can't imagine we can figure
out a way to really do it I fantasize of
an Exit Plan where you say to the cartel
leaders look you've built this vast
organization
but we're gonna we're gonna bomb it into
dust
option two
is we actually help you get into a real
business
and then the cartel says what yeah like
a real business let's say for example we
help Mexico legalize gambling in one
County and then you can own the casinos
but you have to get out of the other
stuff now you can't do the other stuff
but we'll put you in business in a way
that you know you'll be fine your family
will be fine and you can you can
essentially uh launder your criminal
past into some kind of the future
now I suppose to be too many people who
just want to kill them if they lost
their iron grip on control so maybe it
can't work
but I feel like you'd have to at least
try negotiating with him first
because if you say you got two choices
work with us to get into some kind of a
legal business and help Mexico become
great
and let me give you some context
America was greatly benefited by the
Transcontinental Railroad
right so y'all you all learned the story
in America that the railroad from coast
to coast under Lincoln right it was
Lincoln who authorized it and
do you know what a bunch of crooks the
people were doing the railroads were so
the people you know the the what do you
call them the the richest people the
there's a name for him the capitalists
who built them but basically they were
all super Crooks
robber barons yeah the the railroad
robber barons were absolute criminals
that they were just flat out criminals
but they were rich and they had lots of
political influence but eventually those
um I think I'm going to say this without
knowing for sure I believe that the
families of all those robber barons are
now in completely legal businesses
I used to work for a bank called Crocker
Bank
Crocker was the name of one of those
robber barons
he just created a bank that was
completely legit you know was worth
gazillion dollars Wells Fargo bought it
completely legitimate business for many
decades
so it's not impossible
to put robber barons into legitimate
businesses
it's not impossible because we did it
the United States did it so it's not
crazy you just have to compare it to all
the other Kennedys okay perfect and the
Kennedy family
the Kennedy Fortune was made illegally
in with bootlegging right now that's
confirmed right that's not I'm not
saying something that historians don't
agree with am I it's confirmed yeah
Kennedy's father was a bootlegger that's
how he made his money but are any of the
Kennedys is anybody in the Kennedy
family running in the illegal business
today
I don't think so
not that I'm aware of right so there are
plenty of examples
of criminals who went straight and I
believe that if I were the head of a
cartel
I'd be saying to myself
he's such an
the trolls here today
uh
you'd legitimize a criminal and they
just switch bosses
so here's this here's the second thing
you'd have to do you'd have to work with
the cartels to kill their uh competition
maybe you pick the strongest cartel and
you say we're going to work with you to
destroy your competition and then we're
going to turn you into a legitimate
business
But first you have to kill all your
competition for us and we'll give you a
we'll tell you where they are but maybe
we'll give you some Logistics and some
satellite stuff so you know where they
are but just go kill them first
so that this all works
now I don't know that I don't think any
of those plans are necessarily practical
but I will only sell you on one thought
yay is the only candidate
who can even try it
he's the only one who could try it
nobody else can even try it and I don't
know that there's a better way to do it
nobody's nobody's mentioned one
all right ladies and gentlemen that's
all I have for today
um
and uh
I got to tell you
I'm in The Itchy season
so there's like an itch right oh God oh
my God it's exactly where I can't reach
it oh do you know how much better it is
when it's in that place you can't reach
oh
like if you had an itch on your arm
where you could reach it easily it would
itch but it wouldn't itch that much
right but if there's one right in the
middle of your back the only place you
can't reach with your hand if you're a
guy you know women can reach everything
I guess but I can't reach the middle of
my back man when that thing itches oh
unlike that screen portrait
so I I can never be too far away from my
back scratcher
it's got to get to it
you
there's a fake Rob Rider over there
saying he uses an elephant hose to
scratch his back
that was random
all right
um
is there any topic I missed I don't
think there's anything else happening
today
so with that
I believe it's time to go enjoy your
Black Friday and I remind you again you
don't have to be black to enjoy Black
Friday
it's for everybody
it's for everybody
and
I've Got a Feeling
that 2023
is going to be a cool year
like I actually think it's going to be a
good year what do you think uh how are
you feeling optimistic or pessimistic
give me your give me your just feeling
about 2023.
I'm seeing uh
both I'm seeing a mix
uh Jim Keller mentioned me who is Jim
Keller
Jordan Peterson
interviewed Jim Keller
who is Jim Keller
uh uh you got the house
all right Hulk green somebody got a
house
so a lot of pessimism here
all right
um well here's what I'll do
I'm gonna I'm gonna move this Battleship
for you
I will turn you optimistic
bye
the middle of January
that's my goal by the middle of January
I'm going to turn some of you pessimists
into Optimus
that's what I will do
um
by the way somebody said quit drinking
and congratulations every time I see
somebody who quit drinking
like I stop everything
and I say to you to you who just said
you you quit drinking thank you for
telling us
I'm really happy that you said that
publicly seriously I'm very happy you
did every single person who says that
publicly
is adding something to the country
now correct me if I'm wrong
is
um there's some pretty prominent not
anti-alcohol people now aren't there
cernovich I think is anti-alcohol
I am
who are there are some other big well
Trump
is anti uh alcohol
Jack posabic
um
not is Jordan Peterson
Peterson yeah I think I saw something
about that
uh Berenson
is Barons an anti-alcohol too I know
he's anti-weed
uh Joe Rogan but Rogan drinks sometimes
though right
is Joe Rogan anti-alcohol now or
is that a recent change
because I know he in the past not too
long ago he's enjoyed
social drinking uh huberman Andrew
hooverman is anti-alcohol
oh he drinks whiskey only
yeah and I know we're out of you know
sober October
but
interesting
uh oh Andrew Andrew Tate is not opposed
to alcohol is he I think he
uh yeah Tate is
yeah I I I I don't want to mention him
every day
but it's hard it's hard to ignore what a
what a skillful job he's doing of
controlling the media narrative like
it's I just got to give it to him you
know I dislike him for personal reasons
that's just you know between me and him
but he's very abusing and one of the
things he's pulled off
is that apparently he sold the idea that
he can be a uh Whiskey Drinking
or whatever he drinks uh cigar smoking
uh Fitness advisor
and he literally sits there surrounded
by empty booze glasses and and you know
big cigars and he and he tells you how
to take care of your health and and
American men are saying yep okay
that looks like a good role model right
there
but hey he you know his uh social media
following is through the roof yeah like
how how in the world he's pulling this
off
I gotta give it to him he is the energy
monster of of all energy monsters he's
just turning the energy into into clicks
so good for him
but just know what you're getting right
if if you're if you're deciding to uh
you know follow his advice
just just know what you're getting
and by the way a lot of his advice is
good
that's the weirdest thing a lot of uh
edutates advice is actually good advice
but it's also stuff you've seen before
right none I don't think is there
anything he says that's original
can anybody give me an example as Andrew
attained ever come up with like an
original piece of advice that nobody's
heard before I do like his advice nobody
can follow it but his advice about
having multiple passports to try to
become uncancelable but that kind of
just works for people like him
it's not really good general advice
yeah but there's anything that's like a
new
Twist on anything
I feel like you just he's just a best of
kind of guy
I think he's taking the best of pieces
from other influential people and he
just put it together but he did it well
yeah packaging other people's ideas is
not nothing it can be actually the most
important part
yeah he plays the hits yeah all right
well good for him I wish him a I wish
him a good year and I'm going to say
goodbye to YouTube I'll stick around and
talk to the locals platform we'll make
that private after I say goodbye have a
great Friday
bye YouTube and Spotify
