all right there you
are how many of you saw my video I Live
streamed yesterday of the tour of the
Dilbert
Museum did y all see
that all right I'm pinning it right now
it's pinned on my profile if you want to
see a tour of the Dilbert museum at my
house
and
now I'm going to open up your locals
comments for the show of all shows
it's going to be
amazing all right you just hold on it's
going to be
[Music]
incredible good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization and also possibly cat
civilization but we'll get to that later
if you'd like to take this experience up
to levels that nobody can understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a copper marker
glass a tanker gels a Stein a canteen
jug a flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparallel
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go ah
Sublime well I'd like to do a
demonstration now of my um Powers now
this is something that I I demonstrated
privately on a live stream just before I
went live here with the people in
locals and what I'm going to do is uh
I'm borrowing from a um a meme that's on
the internet now that you can you can
tell your cat to come to you if you use
the proper cat language so there's
actually a a phrase or a word that
apparently will call your house cat to
you so I'm going to do this now so turn
up your speaker if you have a cat in the
house and watch what happens you ready
for this this this is real by the way so
turn up your speaker if you have a cat
and Watch What Happens
now if it's the same as the live stream
I did just before this one you can have
your cats running from all your rooms
toward you now tell me in the comments
as we go so other people can see if it
if it's working
out but while you're waiting for your
cats to attack you and jump on your laps
which they're doing right
now yeah they
some are coming some are
not the comments are coming in now cats
are coming some are coming some are not
all right well keep an eye on that so
scientist according to the University of
Bristol they've uh well that's where it
is actually the the research the
University of Bristol and uh they've
created the world's first carbon 14
Diamond battery Diamond battery yeah so
now you can keep your spouse uh powered
up at all times so I was I was looking
for a diamond
battery this one uh could last uh
thousands of years so what makes it
special is how long it lasts and it
could last in terrible environments like
space so you could send in a space probe
and have a diamond battery and it would
stay powered for
I don't know hundreds or thousands of
years so I don't think this will be in
common usage but if you need anything
that needs power for a few thousand
years you got an option Diamond
battery well did you know that if you
eat ultr processed food you have a
higher risk of depressive symptoms
according to S
poost of course you did or you could
have just asked me yes if you eat crap
food your mental state will decline if
you eat healthy food your mental state
will be better how many times do we need
to test this would this be the millionth
research study that showed that if you
eat right your brain works better and
you're
happier I don't think it's ever going in
any other direction has it has there
ever been a a scientific study that said
H we we took these people and we made
them eat right for a month and
everything went off the rails they
couldn't concentrate when they were
eating right not once 100% of the
science is all in the same
direction your body is your
brain good news uh Trump has introduced
a trump
fragrance okay there's a there's a theme
today so the theme for the show is that
I can't tell what's true today there's a
lot of news today but unlike most days
where you go oh that's probably true I
don't know about that one yeah that
looks true today almost every story I
looked at I
thought I don't know if that's true so
is this true is it true that Trump has a
introduced a trump fragrance called
fight fight fight or is that just an
internet meme does anybody know if
that's true
because the funniest part about it
is even even if you like Trump a lot as
a
politician do you really want to smell
like
him I've never once never once have I
you know awakened in the morning it's
like oh if
only if only I could find a way to smell
like President
Trump now I'm not saying it smells bad
I'm just saying it never really occurred
to me to to try to match his
fragrance so I can't tell if it's even
real is that
real I'm looking in the comments I'm not
seeing anybody say it's not
real I don't know there's just something
wonderful about it the the whole story
meanwhile here's the Second Story I
can't tell if it's real there is a an
alleged video which I watched that seems
to show K Harris what they say is her
home residence and some kind of a
holiday
party and if it's a real video she is
really
drunk but it's a grainy video and it's
in the age of AI fakes so I don't know I
have no idea if that's real and that's
going to be my theme for today as I told
you like I know is is the Trump
fragrance
real uh I have no idea is that video of
comml Harris that looks drunk but also
could easily be AI Is that
real I don't know I mean I really
genuinely don't I'm not even leaning in
One Direction I don't know if that's
real but it would be easier to fake a
video if it were a grainy video where
you couldn't see the lips sinking to the
AI that would be the at the moment that
would be the tell so I don't trust that
one but it could be real it might be
real I don't
know meanwhile K Harris's campaign
manager Quenton
fols who some some say he's the one who
folked everything up Quenton
folks um but uh he was talking about why
they didn't have a Democrat
primary and he said quote to open up a
Democrat primary you would have had
black women be highly upset if it was
not KLA
Harris
um
really we're we're saying this out loud
now that that it had to be a black woman
it had to be Comm Harris and that was
basically the that's all they could live
with well here's what I think now I've
said this a few times but every time
there's more evidence for it I'll remind
you I don't think the Democrat Party can
recover normally you expect somebody
loses a major election you know they're
actually come back stronger the next
time because they know what they did
wrong they get a better candidate they
they improve their game and they come
back stronger but I don't think you can
come back from the identity
politics because once you've convinced
all your people in your grab bag of of a
party that uh their identity needs to
win then they're going to play that way
they're going to play for their identity
to win but not just nationally they're
going to play for a win within the
Democrat Party too which should destroy
it because if they can't think like a
party and they can only think like their
identity you can't really make a
movement out of that have you noticed
that the magga people all are on the
same page hey hey Maga person randomly
tap you on the shoulder hey hey do you
do you support Trump yes I do and what
give me an idea what your sort of
philosophy is that's that's part of this
and they would say something like
America
First are are you also for America First
oh you're on my team that's it it's
simple so so Trump put together a you
know a pirate ship of Common Sense
people who if you ask them what it is
that binds them together it would be
something that could bind you together
forever America and there would be no
conflict there and you know exactly what
you're all trying to get okay I get it
you're all America so what is it that
you want to achieve oh oh the
Constitution right you want the
Constitution and free markets got it
very
easy but no I think that the the
identity politics is a one-way
trip I I can't even come up with a
creative thought in my mind about how
they could ever dig their way out
because as long as you've got big
Pockets that can you know can turn on
them at any moment they've got to keep
all the pockets happy and then they
can't really have a winning winning
group of people because it just won't be
enough so I don't know I I think the
Democrats may have found the one and
only way that they could make themselves
uncompetitive for the rest of history at
National level they'll be fine at a
local level but nationally it looks like
they can never win
again now I'm saying this partly
recreationally and partly with a little
hyperbole of course if they got a really
strong candidate that's probably all
would take all either side really needs
is a candidate that doesn't act drunk
and say stupid stuff and they've got a
chance so one good candidate they'd be
back in action but I don't know who that
would be
they don't seem to have anybody who's an
obvious candidate to be that one strong
candidate and have you noticed
that um Obama went from chocolate Jesus
to irrelevant and kind of stupid and
maybe a little bit
racist I've never seen anybody's
reputation just just sink like that so
quickly because even if you hated his
policies you would have said well he's
he's certainly good at what he's doing
you know speaking and communicating and
persuading and you know just basically
acting like a president but the last few
times we've seen
Obama it almost looked comically
incompetent why is that did he did he
always have other people writing his
stuff so he looked more capable than
than he was when he was president has he
lost a step maybe he's
not maybe he's not reading as much I
don't know is is there some reason he he
looks to me like not the same person he
was five years
ago and he's not that old so it's not
just age right so I don't know so I
think it might be a little bit
psychological meaning that if my
opinions about the world have shifted
then my opinion about him maybe gets
shifted at the same time
but I've never seen anybody go from so
capable to so
incompetent apparently and again it
could be just a psychological phenomenon
that's happening in my head but it sure
looks like he turned
incompetent I wasn't really expecting
that because I've always I've always
said that even if you don't like his
politics or anything about his
personality he's just really good at his
job but not lately it's not his job but
he's a public
Communicator meanwhile Tim wal
has his uh his newest explanation of why
they lost he says quote uh I think we're
we're going to have to understand what
type of leadership do they want talking
about the country he said we were
pledging to be inclusive we were
pledging to bring people in uh Donald
Trump has said that isn't what he wants
and so that's what America is leaning
towards I guess for me it's to
understand and learn more about America
because I thought they were going to
probably move towards a more positive
message oh my God he's
lost they are so lost they think that
discriminating against white men is
inclusive they don't know that they were
the bad guys they don't know that the
reason that magga grew is because it
wasn't
racist there was there was nothing
stopping anybody from joining magga
because it there was no identity
politics but on the Democrat side they
were literally overtly discriminating
against white men
forever and and they call that
inclusive all right let me ask you a
question did you hear the story about
the highly qualified uh Black American
man he was a he was an
engineer and he went to the best schools
and he had really good experience and he
he couldn't get a job in Corporate
America did you hear that story highly
qualified and uh he just couldn't get a
job because he was a black man in
America no you haven't heard that story
because that isn't anything that can
happen in
America there's probably never one case
where a qualified black man let's say an
engineer just to pick an example
couldn't get a good job in Corporate
America I'll bet there's not one you in
the whole country let me say it again I
don't think there's even one not even
one literally one I'm not I'm not
exaggerating I don't think there's
one qualified black engineer who can't
get a job right away
anywhere now have you ever heard of a
qualified white man who couldn't get a
job because of
Dei yes every one of you have heard
that how do you you live in this country
and think that black men can't get a job
in Corporate America that's not a thing
everybody who has qualifications has a
job in America pretty much everybody
except white men who get taken out by
Dei all right um so Dei is racism and
the the Democrats and Tim wals have not
figured out and and Tim
Walls all right why was Tim Walls even
selected the VP
candidate does he not know that he was
not qualified to be the top of his own
ticket did Tim Walls know that he
couldn't have been the top of the ticket
it wasn't an option if he's a Democrat
did does he literally genuinely in the
real world not know that he couldn't
have been the top of the ticket because
he's a white
man like how lost is he like I'm
genuinely curious
I is he
stupid or am I stupid because I can't
figure this out like why he can't figure
it
out there's some mystery here I don't
know what it is maybe maybe the
problem's on my
end well anyway yes I told you MSNBC I
use it as the comedy
channel um because all you have to do is
simply report what they did and and it
makes you laugh you don't even need any
commentary are you ready ready for this
all right I saw some couple of posts
from Johnny Mega on X reporting what uh
shows a video of Joy Reid on
MSNBC and this is what Joy Reed said
about Tulsi gabard she said that Tulsi
gabard will be feeding Trump quote
conspiracies from Russian State media uh
in her job as Director of National
Intelligence quote she's going to come
in there and whatever RT that's Russia
Today publication has fed in her life
she can then feed feed that to Donald
Trump
now I don't need any commentary on that
right that's just
funny there's nothing to say about it
it's just funny that this person has a
TV show and people watch it I mean not
many but few but that's not all of
it uh she also implied um that the
January
Prisoners the overwhelming majority of
them of course not having any kind of
legal problems in the past before that
um she said that when they get released
she goes quote God knows what that is
like when those people are showing up in
the Walmarts of the Home Depot we're in
for a wild
ride Joy Reed thinks that when you
unlock the lifetime of law- abiding
white guys mostly white guys that
they're going to run into
Walmart and Home Depot yelling
W and trying to shoot stuff what are
they gonna
do yeah I'm really I'm really worried
about the the Ruckus at my local Home
Depot when when all the January Sixers
get out and and go to buy some
Improvement tools to fix up their
house what is wrong with her all
right so yeah most of the most of the
news today is about videos and photos
that I think might be fake and of course
over racism against white men in pretty
much every
story uh meanwhile New York city mayor
Eric
Adams who we alternately like to love
and and hate because he seems to be like
half a
Republican and and half a Democrat so if
you want a reason to dislike him you
just pick whichever side you don't like
and you're like ah I don't like that
half I didn't realize he used to be a
republican so that that would explain
why you know he's he's not like a crazy
leftist Democrat he's just sort of a
standard middle- of the road Democrat
but uh he's teasing that he might be
open to switching parties he doesn't say
it but but the way he answered questions
about that
question made you think that maybe he's
not wed to his political party now it's
interesting because he's an legal
Jeopardy um and I wonder first of all I
don't know if the corruption charges are
real we live in a world where it could
be lawfare you never know but I wonder
if he thinks no I guess those wouldn't
be probably wouldn't be federal charges
anyway so he's not playing for a pardon
he's not hoping to change parties and
get a pardon because it's state charges
right the allegations against him so
we'll keep an eye on
him but uh but at least we understand
why he he seems a little bit one foot in
each of those worlds because he's had
one foot in each of those
worlds there's a
uh terrible data coming out of the Texas
A&M Corpus Christie Colin rug is
reporting this on X that
apparently there's an alarming number of
bottlenosed
dolphins that are showing up with traces
of fentanyl in their
systems and they said that more than a
third of the Dolphins tested uh were
positive for
drugs now of course the story is that
that they think maybe the fenel is
getting into the waste system and then
gets into the ocean then the then the
bottle knows Dolphins get into it but um
I've got a different Theory the reason
they're called called bottlenose
dolphins is uh because they're they're
famous as being alcoholics uh that's why
they call them Bottlenose it's like oh
can you get that bottle out of your nose
for just a second so the regular
Dolphins they don't have much of an
addiction problem but the Bottle
Nose well they're partyers they're
partyers so maybe it's because of the
Wastewater
system maybe they're just getting it
directly from Mexico and snorting it I
don't know I don't know what's real I'm
just saying I don't know much about
dolphins is what I'm saying but the only
thing I know for sure
is they didn't do it on
purpose meanwhile according to Fox News
the feds have been using Banks to
surveil Americans and they've asked
Banks to search for terms like um like
uh Trump Mega bass proops Cabellas I
guess that's some kind of store that we
don't have around here and Dick Sporting
Goods
so so apparently the
uh the which group is it uh the
committee uh one of the uh government
committees called the uh subcommittee on
the weaponization of the federal
government so it's looked into this and
found out that banks have been a little
too Cooperative with government
requests um and maybe cross the line
constitutionally that's what they're
looking at but I used to work for a
bank and I have this advice for
you there's no such thing as a
confidential financial transaction
unless you pay cash and then murder the
person you you transacted
with it if if you're doing anything
financially of course the government can
get at it do let let me explain uh Bank
an ER mentality to you you ready hi I'm
from the government I would like you to
bend over and shove your own ass or
shove your own head all the way up your
own ass now I'll do the
banker
okay that that's the relationship of the
government and the banks
because the bank can't tell the
government
no the the banks are really really
dependent on the laws being just the way
they are to protect the banks I'm not
even sure why we have Banks I mean the
only thing that protects the entire
banking industry is that they they
somehow have you know cooperated with
with the government to the point where
they've got basically a legal Monopoly
because don't you think that Elon Musk
Could Build a Better Bank on an app in
about an
afternoon yes right modern technology
would allow you to build a bank on an
app and have every feature you ever
wanted
without any of the banking
structure so they pretty much have to do
whatever the government tells them they
would be afraid of getting on the bad
side of any of that government stuff so
yeah you never you never you were never
safe your bank was never going to stand
between you and the government snooping
into your stuff Bank won't do that it's
bad for business so no surprise there
well you probably heard that the uh
Daniel penny case has taken a turn so
apparently the jury said that they were
hung on the first count of second degree
manslaughter so the first count is the
highest degree of of risk and would be
the most jail sentenced
there there's a lower level
charge um but the top level charge the
judge said well if you can't agree on
this we'll basically dismiss it now go
back think about the lower charge I
guess that'll happen on Monday
so here's what the people who know way
more than I do about the law and the
courts are telling me so I'm listening
to people like Mike cernovich and people
have legal backgrounds and uh Jonathan
Turley um is writing about it so let me
just tell you what Jonathan Turley says
because uh having me interpret legal
stuff is a bad idea so it's better to
hear from people who know what they're
talking
about so toly says so now the judge has
dismissed the first count on second
degree manslaughter and is allowing the
jury to consider the second count after
the weekend this is precisely what brag
was hoping for in setting up a possible
compromise
verdict now what you need to know about
that phrase a compromise verdict if I
understand it correctly is that the
judge is trying to get people on the
jury to think not so much about guilty
or Innocent but rather how they can be
done with this
process and the way they can be done
with the process is to be unanimous
about something and if they're closer to
being unanimous we don't know this but
if they're closer to being unanimous
unguilty then he's going to say go back
in on the lower charge and you don't get
to go home you know until I say so so
you could imagine that the the indirect
pressure on the jurists would be to
first of all do what the other jurist
want them to do conform so they can go
home and uh it would kind of bias you
toward well you know if we were nice
enough to let them off on the top
charge but we don't want to be so nice
that we let them completely free because
then we have to live in the world and
answer to all of our neighbors and we
can't so wouldn't it be better for for
the jury wouldn't it be better for the
jury to find him guilty on a lesser
charge but still goes to jail but is not
as bad as the top one so that's a
terrible situation to put the jury in
you're you're really causing the jury to
think about themselves instead of The
Facts of the case that's how I
understand the compromise situation so
if that's the case I think the whole
thing should be thrown out I mean I
think the Judge probably should go to
jail
don't
you I don't think that's a thing I mean
I don't I don't think that for this
Behavior anybody ever goes to jail but
if I look at what crimes were committed
and I look at the videos of Daniel peny
I say to myself huh I do not see Daniel
Penny intending to do anything
wrong or doing anything wrong there's no
intention and I didn't see anything
wrong uh there's a tragedy but I didn't
see him act wrong but what about the
judge the judge is signaling an
intention to be wrong meaning creating a
situation that no judge should create
it's got to be intentional and pushing
them toward the wrong decision to find
what I think is an innocent man guilty
and sending him to jail so that the
jurors themselves can have a nicer
week that is evil on a level that's
almost hard to
comprehend it's just such a casual evil
that this would be a judge who just
wakes up and goes to work and says some
stuff in the context of his job so it so
it's not like you know the gas chamber
or something where where the visual of
it and the thought of it is you
overwhelmingly
horrible but this is pretty
overwhelmingly horrible the fact that
you can casually just go up and go to
your job and send some innocent
guy to jail intentionally and and then
the next day you just wake up and go to
your job again now this
judge if we lived in a world that was
fair according to
me because I get to decide what's fair
it's my my live stream uh I think the
Judge probably should be in jail already
and I think Bragg and and anybody
involved in this because as
uh as Turley tells us um he says um the
prosecutors hope to pressure the jury
into voting on the low standard of
criminal negligence so that's
essentially what I'm saying and then
toly says outside of New York or a few
other cities this case would likely
either have not been brought or would
have collapsed quickly before the
jury now Charlie knows more than I do
about the legal stuff obviously and he
says this wouldn't even be charged in
most places in America no I believe
that's
true
so um I would say that if New York is
going to play with a a set of rules
that's so different from what you and I
think is
realistic um we should definitely not do
business with New York I wouldn't I
wouldn't take my business there I
wouldn't travel there I would just stay
away from that just stay away from New
York so I think if if Penny goes down
because of this and it's not corrected
immediately in some
way I think we have to take the whole
 State down because New York
State the citizens which includes some
of my family members so sorry about that
who who might be listening at at the
moment uh I think the state has to pay I
I think there's got to be a price and
it's got to be a lot and I I think if
the GDP of New York State went down 20%
the next year that might be about right
I mean it should be really expensive
because if this is the lowest level
of Social and American Behavior you
could ever even imagine this is so bad
and uh there's another theme for today's
show and I'm going to say this as
carefully as
possible I never am in favor of violence
of course and I would never promote it
or endorse it or you know glamorize
it but it's certainly getting harder
every day every time I read the news I
think
huh I I wonder if there's somebody who's
going to become violent over this
because it certainly looks like it's
inviting it but I don't I don't favor
that so don't do that but it but you
can't not think about it because there's
just so many so many ways that the news
is so horrible you think
H speaking of
which Let's uh talk about the healthc
care Hitman now uh I was watching Jesse
water show yesterday and uh apparently
they've already given the The Hitman a a
nickname the healthc care
Hitman I think uh CNN had a different
branding for it I may have this wrong
but it might have been the the uh
the CEO killer or something so the news
is trying to Brand it like they always
do so that they've got an ongoing story
because they love the ongoing stories
especially the criminal ones and so the
the first thing you need to know is
that let me let me this is going to be
hard because I need to say this is
delicately as possible to keep myself
out in
trouble do you think that this if this
had not been a healthc care
executive and a white guy do you think
that they would have called him the
healthc care
Hitman the the person who did the
murder because it's almost like you're
you're giving him a clever little
nickname I don't know it makes makes me
wonder if there's if
we're if we're having too much fun with
the story and we wouldn't do it if it
were George Floyd right if George Floyd
got murdered we we wouldn't
be we wouldn't be giving a clever
nickname
to um you know Derek schauen right
Chauvin never got like a clever nickname
it it's almost as if this is
revealing that there's sort of an
undercurrent in
America where people are not so sad
about
this right and I'm not saying that's
good
so don't get me wrong I'm just saying
that in in a number of ways I'm getting
this subtle
suggestion that people don't feel bad
about this
crime partly because it's a white man
let's be honest it was a wealthy white
guy and the country just doesn't have
the same kind of empathy for wealthy
older white guys we just don't and so
that's part of
it but there's also Lots a mystery to it
and the uh alleged shooter if you
believe at least one of the photos which
I don't believe by the way would be a
really handsome young guy so now you've
got this you know apparently a very
smart killer who's got his own clever
nickname the healthcare Hitman
and and the one picture of him that
they're trying to sell us on which I
don't believe by the way uh he's really
goodlooking like really good looking
like movie star
good-look I don't know there there
there's something
terribly wrong about how movie perfect
this is and that we're treating it as
entertainment and I am too so I'm I'm
I'm as guilty as the people I'm talking
about so the the the effect that I'm
seeing in other people which is what I'm
describing I feel it too I I feel like
my own sense of empathy has been and
hijacked into some kind of recreational
mode so so I apologize for that uh but
there are a lot of interesting things
about the story for
example uh the fact that he got out of
New
York so apparently he left on foot got a
bike took a bike into the park they say
he left a backpack there his backpack
we'll talk about that I don't believe
that either and uh took a little known
bus station that's lesser used so the
fewer Witnesses and got out of the state
they think they also think that he used
a veterinarian gun now this is not
everybody but there's some thought that
he used a veterinarian
gun which is apparently I never I never
knew there was one but because there
might be other animals in the
neighborhood of when you're putting down
an animal such as let's say cattle or
something um you don't want to scare the
other animals so you have this thing
that works at very close range literally
you're supposed to put it up to the
skull of the animal you're going to put
down is so it's not even meant to shoot
20 feet I don't believe it's meant for
one shot in the head close up I think
that's all it's for now that's only if
it's truly a veterinarian gun which I
never even heard of before um so here
are the things that I think I know for
sure
his his quick use of the gun whether he
was putting in a new shell or clearing
it there's a little uh little
disagreement on that he certainly knew
what he was
doing so he seemed to understand the
weapon well enough to know that he had
to do a thing after every shot whatever
the thing was and then he did
it but if he were if he were a
professional he would have used the
veterinarian gun the way the
veterinarians use it which is he would
have run up cuz the guy was just walking
he was only what 10 or 15 ft in front of
him all he had to do is take a few few
running
steps bang and then drop the gun if
there was no DNA on
it but he didn't
so so here's the thing you've all seen
now probably the the face where they
claim it's another picture of the
shooter but this time he pulled his mask
down to flirt with somebody at at a
hostel and you can clearly see his face
now I'm going to tell you something that
I haven't seen in the news
yet but have any of you ever experienced
the facial recognition apps that are
currently available now I I don't know
if they're available to the public maybe
they're only available to law
enforcement at this point
but um I'm going to tell you something
that maybe you didn't know about them
they would identify this guy 100% of the
time there is plenty of his face
showing a facial recognition app would
pick him up 100% of the time there's no
way he's not on social media which is
how the facial recognition finds you
there's no way he's not on social media
he he has a very distinctive face and
you can see the whole face there is no
chance that if that's a real picture of
the shooter that law enforcement doesn't
already know who he is it would be about
5 SE in fact if if you have the facial
recognition app you could probably
recognize I bet you could get an ID just
from the photo that's on social media
does anybody have access to one if you
have one of the facial recognition that
just put it on the phone it'll tell you
who that guy is so I don't think there's
any
chance that if you show that picture to
the whole world that he's not been
identified by
now do you think that's real do you
think there's any
chance that that picture is clearly as
you can see his face and he's so
distinctive and it's been on every TV
show everywhere and you think that a guy
who looks like that and at that age
doesn't have a you know families and
friends and people who would recognize
him
immediately everything about this story
is
off first of all the story where you see
is is his face
clearly it's obviously not the shooter
he's wearing different clothes as
different
backpack it's obviously not him because
if it were him we would already have him
we'd know who he is because his face is
completely recognizable if the public
hadn't done it the facial recognition
software would do it literally in a
second in one second you just go in fact
you if you have it on your phone just
call up the picture and just put your
phone next to it if you've got one of
those apps click on it and in one second
it'll tell you who it is if he's a real
person now some have said it might be
like a Hollywood mask or something maybe
but that was a pretty big smile for a
mask I don't know it's hard to pull off
that smile I think if you had a mask you
would maybe try to prevent smiling
because that would be one place you
could spot there was something
wrong uh yeah he doesn't have the same
jacket and then the police say they
found the backpack in the park and then
the backpack doesn't even look like the
backpack he was wearing say some people
so none of the colors are right the
person isn't right it's all wrong it's
all wrong now I'm going to tell you a
story from my real
life that that matches this story you
won't believe that there's any story
that matches this story but there is my
first job in Corporate America was a
bank teller and I got robbed twice at
gunpoint during my job as a teller one
of those times uh the guy who robbed me
was this uh older man I thought he was
maybe late 60s um kind of disheveled
gray hair losing Most of It kind of
smallish about my
size and so when the FBI came they said
all right can you describe the guy who
robbed you I described him that way this
old guy with a little bit of gray hair
blah blah blah
and then they came back and they said um
are you sure you pulled the alarm on
time because there's a secret way that
tellers pulled the alarm so the cameras
will capture the the crime and I said
yeah I'm positive like as soon as he
asked for the money I did the thing
where you activate the camera and they
said because there's nobody on the film
that looks anything like what you
described so they said we're going to
take you down to the secret FBI
headquarters and we're going to show you
the video and you tell me that's the guy
who who robbed you I'm like sure easy
because the guy he was very distinctive
and he had a long long coat on I mean I
I had Perfect Memory of him and my boss
um soon as the the robber left I alerted
my boss and my boss followed him down
the street like from a distance but just
to get a ID and when my boss was asked
to describe him he described him the
same way I did older guy gray hair got a
small Long Jacket so we had the same
description and then the FBI shows me
the video uh of the moment and they say
all right is this guy standing in front
of the teller window is that the one
that robbed you I was like
no that's not even close so they showed
me this video of a guy who looked like a
young Clint Eastwood with a big mustache
you know solid dark air probably mid-30s
yeah and had a sport coat on didn't have
a long like you know jacket like the guy
I saw and I was said no obviously not so
they said watch this and then manually
they could um they could uh rewind the
video and I watched that guy rob me on
video so a guy who looked like Clint
Eastwood on video
was the actual guy who robbed me the guy
I saw very clearly and described within
seconds I mean minutes I guess of the
actual robbery and my boss independently
who did not talk to me before that we
described him as a completely different
person explain that and it's even
weirder once I saw the person on video
that looked like that young Clint
Eastwood I said first of all I've never
seen that guy in
person but I've definitely seen him a
lot because he's got a picture right on
the wall where I worked saying that he
was a bank rubber who was you know he
was a known Bank rubber he was literally
on the wall as a known bank robber and
he looked just like the video I I
recognized him immediately when I saw
the video but I didn't recognize him in
person you look like an old man so you
tell me what happened it's been one of
the great mysteries of my
life now I got robbed twice the other
one I picked out of a lineup easily as
did all the other people easy he he
looked exactly like I described him
picked them out of a lineup no
problem but
sometimes people don't look like look
like they look on video that's all I can
tell you all I can tell you is that
sometimes the video doesn't match what
you thought you saw in
person so I don't know um CNN said that
the bullet casings did have some
inscription in them something engraved
that would suggest it was a healthcare
related um problem meaning that he
somebody maybe got denied some coverage
because had that deny delay title of the
book on it now I had predicted that in
the fog of crime you would ultimately
find out that there is not the
inscription on the
bullets I'm going to stick with that I'm
going to stick with it even though CNN
just
confirmed that there is something on the
bullets and they even gave details and
I'm still going to stick with there's
nothing on the
bullets now you might say to me but
Scott that's a very bad bet because
everybody's reporting there's something
on the
bullets I'm not there yet I'm not there
I'm going to need to see a picture of
those
bullets I'm going to need to see a
picture because I think I think there's
a problem that maybe people are hearing
it from other news sources and you know
maybe you maybe it's just one fake story
that got Amplified I'm going to wait but
maybe I I'm not going to rule out that
it's on there but not quite buying it
yet everything about this story looks
hinky anyway so we'll we'll wait on that
um as one of the January Sixers said uh
and I'm
paraphrasing uh I stood outside the
capital on January
6 and had no criminal record did not
post anything on social media and the
FBI found me in two
weeks okay now hold that in your
head they they found that guy in two
weeks now there were other videos there
so of course they could pick them up you
think that they don't know who this guy
is I'm having real trouble
believing that they don't know who at
least the one with his face showing is
so there's something very deeply wrong
about
this meanwhile over in El Salvador I
don't know how this is real either so
the president uh buelli he just says El
Salvador has discovered they have a$3
trillion doll unmined gold
fields and now he's moving to
decriminalize um some of the mining laws
or get rid of some regulations I guess
so that they can mine it $3 trillion
doll of unmined gold they also found
according to the president gallium
talium tin and other materials needed
for you know the future so so this young
guy this young good-looking guy comes in
becomes the president of El Salvador
brings in didn't he bring in Bitcoin as
as their legal currency which turned out
to be a genius move apparently
and uh then he solves all of crime in
the country by locking up just basically
everybody who even looked a little
criminal and now he just by luck he
happens to be in charge when they find
$3 trillion do of extra money that would
turn El Salvador from you know a wannabe
I don't know what would you say it a uh
not a third world country but it would
basically put him right right at the top
tier of economic powers in the world
and this just happened by coincidence
the same time the guy who did all the
other good stuff is in power this is
weird like it just seems too simulation
or too too many coincidences I don't
know meanwhile over in
Syria um Iranian assets are pulling out
so the Iranians of course were
supporting Assad as were the Russians
but the rebels are making such progress
and the
um I guess Assad's forces are not
putting up much resistance so the
reporting is that the Iranian assets the
generals and the advisers and whatever
are just running because they know they
can't do it themselves and they're not
getting help from the military so
they're just abandoning so it looks like
Assad is going to maybe Retreat his
forces to the most important defensible
part which is the part that's
Russian Port so the area around the
Russian Port because if they don't
protect
that then Russia doesn't have any reason
to protect
them so what if Russia doesn't protect
them and what if they lose that port and
the rebels take
over that changes a lot of things
doesn't it it and again I'll say that I
think that what's happening in Syria has
to be seen as part of all the variables
for war from you know Hezbollah to Hamas
to
Ukraine I think it's all related because
it's all the same players so this gives
them lots of variables to say all right
if you give us a little relief on
Syria I could do a little more on
Gaza but if you pull back on ESB we
could maybe let Iran do a little more
trade so I think it's going to be
something where all those variables are
in play we might not know
it in other words there could be some
secret components of the negotiation
that are not public because you know
maybe Iran can do things secretly that
they don't want to tell their public
they're doing you know something like
that so I feel like the Syria situation
makes the odds of a larger
deal you know with Russia and Ukraine
and United States and
Iran more Poss not
less so it feels to me like a positive
situation that it's moving in in a
Direction that's let's say destabilizing
for Iran and for Russia and also showing
their weaknesses to the world because
neither Iran nor Russia can seemingly
can protect Assad at the moment from
Rebels it's not even the strongest
military anyway the other biggest story
is that all over social media there are
all these videos of drones or possibly
uaps or UFOs or secret
technology
and I had been ignoring
it largely up until
now um because I thought oh it's just
it's just somebody's balloon or it's
just you know it's just somebody's uh
drone they're flying around but today I
wake up and there's like videos from the
East Coast videos from the West Coast
videos from
Argentina I think a few other places in
which there were these glowing orbs
doing things in sequence in one case
they seem to be going into the ocean and
remember my main theme for today is that
all of the news is either overtly racist
against white men and and that's what
the story is in one form or another or
it's video or photos that I can't tell
are real so so we got the KLA Harris
drunk video I don't know if that's real
we got the healthc care Hitman full
facial that somehow they can't they
can't identify him from the full facial
picture I don't know that that's real
and then we've got what looks to be
dozens of videos of these anomalous
flying things and I don't know if any of
them are real
because it seems like the easiest thing
you could fake would be to do some AI
take a regular video and then add some
glowing orbs how hard would it be to add
some glowing orbs that literally the
easiest thing you could ever add to an
existing video would be a point of
glowing orb moving around so are the
videos
real there there are now a lot of them
there are now a lot of them
so here's something that somebody said
on social media that just put all of it
to rest for
me if these uaps which are over a lot of
them are over American bases or over
American
assets if they were really a
threat you would see American Military
trying like hell to shoot him down even
if they didn't know what they were you
know the American Military would be all
over over it you know that you'd see the
drones but then you would immediately
see you know helicopters and jets and
stuff trying to figure out what they are
and you don't see
that the only explanation is it's it's
our
stuff am I wrong about
that it if if the American Military is
not reacting to flying objects they
can't identify routinely over their
bases it's got to come from the base or
it's Got To Be An American Military
asset
right well you're saying
no how could it be anything except ours
if we're not responding to
it I I don't see any possibility that it
could be a real threat or even a real
unknown at least to the military people
who directly below it there's no
scenario in which they're not lighting
up the sky if they can't identify flying
risks above a military facility I mean
even if they didn't think it was a
military risk they'd still shoot the
 thing down because it's over a
military
base yeah it doesn't matter who it is if
you're over a military base and you're
hovering and you're you know you're
looking
dangerous Am I Wrong they're going to
shoot it down or at least they're going
to try so the fact that you don't even
see any attempted interaction it's is
pretty confirmatory that either the
pictures are
fake or the military knows exactly what
they are but they can't say because it's
you know private but that wouldn't
explain the ones in other countries I
think the other countries probably just
drones you know people have drones and
some of them are operating in some kind
of coordinated way Etc but the other
possibility that's more exciting is that
uh there might be some Chinese tanker
ship you know off the coast of America
and they're doing testing you know every
once in a while they'll release a dozen
drones and watch watch the response from
America and then maybe maybe America
knows that's what's happening or
suspects that's what's happening and
they don't want to give away the
response so maybe they're letting them
you know do it to think that we don't
have a response but maybe we do I don't
know I'm not buying that so I think
that's that's a little too too much to
accept so I'm going to go with the ones
that are over American bases are just
our own technology because of course
we're doing um Advanced drone
coordinated attacks of course we are
every every modern country is working on
that right now so obviously there should
be a whole bunch of
American um drones practicing military
stuff above bases it's the most obvious
thing I would expect to see if
everything is working the way it
should but the ones in other countries
and the other videos they might be just
fake videos so I think it might be a
combo of American stuff that's perfectly
safe to Americans and some fake videos
from other places and other times and
stuff like that that's my best guess but
I don't
know
um so Taylor Loren continues to get in
trouble I I've tried every day to not do
a story about her cuz she's always in
the news and it's always some ridiculous
story about something she said or
believes and other people want to mock
her and it never it never felt like
there was enough meat to it for me to
talk about her she was just sort of a a
character in social media and the news
that people like talking about wasn't
really enough for
me but uh I'm going to talk about her
today because she made a little news um
and I'm just going to read the quote
because the exact wording matters so TMZ
was talking to her and TMZ challenged
and said you said people wonder why we
want these Executives dead now the
interpretation of that is that Taylor
Len understands why somebody would want
to kill a health care insurance
executive which would be too far for a
public figure that would be too far
because if you say you understand it
that's H that's just one step from
condoning it so that's that's too much
for a public figure so TMZ I think um by
the way I I always have respect for TMZ
I always I've told you the story but
once there was fake news about me some
years ago TMZ was the only ones who
called to ask me if it was true and I
said no it's not true here's the context
and then they didn't run a story about
it they were the only ones who fact
jacked a rumor about me by calling me
and saying is that true oh no that's not
true so uh so I like TMZ and I like that
they're pushing
back um so here's what Taylor Len said
she said uh I'm with the people it is
natural to wish that the people who run
those systems would suffer the same fate
as your loved one am I going to shed
tears or have a lot of empathy for
somebody who has facilitated the deaths
of thousand of innocent
Americans
yikes yikes now if this were just her
weird little um Taylor Loren's opinion
then I wouldn't be talking about it
because that that's what I've ignored up
till now it's just her opinion so I
ignore it but this isn't just her
opinion I I think in this case she's
doing something
useful meaning that she's telling you
how
feels which is different from how she
would act or or how her sense of reason
would would guide
her and she is basically saying that
it's not that unusual to expect people
to have that kind of
mental mental
processing toward what we're seeing and
I gotta
say um I'm not going to endorse her
words but you all feel that too right
right is she completely wrong I don't
think she's wrong about how some portion
of America feels about it now of course
it's a big country so people have
opinions all over the place as they
always do but is it true that a
substantial number of Americans are so
mad about what has happened to them and
maybe people they know or love uh in
terms of healthcare being denied or any
other bad
behavior is it
weird that people are let's say more uh
forgiving of a of a tragic
murder than you'd expect if it were some
other situation you know I I think she's
sort of a canary in the coal mine here
in the sense that it's useful for her to
have said this out
loud it's
useful so I'm actually going to give her
credit for
this um she's taking a lot of heat but
she put it out there and I think it's
worth talking
about um but I'm going to add this
context when I read the news which I do
every day every other story wants me uh
makes me want to kill
[Laughter]
somebody have you had that experience
that you know I don't recommend it and I
and I'm not going to give you any
examples but just think about the
stories I've told you just in the news
you know not just today but in the past
just pick any period past week or so how
many of those stories have at least one
person in the story that privately I'm
thinking to myself you know if something
happened to them it might be a better
world a lot a lot and I asked myself is
this what social media is doing to me
is social media turning me into somebody
who immediately thinks of violence when
I'm just reading the news and it's not
about War I mean if it's about war of
course
but when I when I read about let's say
all right I'm going to give you an
example I'm probably going to get
canceled for
this no I'm not going to give you
example it's too easy I don't want to
give my enemies such an easy an easy
path of attack but let's just say there
are a lot of things in let's say the
Justice domain the Justice domain I
won't be more particular than that
aren't there a lot of things in the
Justice domain where you're saying at
the very
least I feel like the people in charge
should be the ones in
jail right and this is very different
from how I've seen the news in the past
I there are a whole bunch of stories
where my first instinct is oh those
people need to be in jail and I'll say
jail because I don't want to say
anything violent but you know jail so
that we're within the legal
process there's something that's there's
something about social media but maybe
there's something about the nature of
the
stories which is causing me to
immediately go to thoughts of
violence for every other story in the
news it's the weirdest thing so I think
we should be really aware of what's
happening to us psychologically just the
fact that we so quickly go to the the
violent solution you know if you're
smart you're not going to say it out
loud you're not going to act on it
you're not going to incentivize anybody
to do it but boy you can't stop thinking
it can you it's hard not to think
it all right here's uh another great
mystery of the world if you spend time
on social media uh as I do at least in
the siloed corner of social media that I
find myself every single day with no
exceptions every single day there'll be
a new story about a new study that says
the uh covid vaccination
caused all manner of Health Care
problems and that it was way worse than
if you just let people get sick now I'm
not saying that's true I'm saying that
my corner of social media reports it as
true with new data new research there's
a new person who's talking about it
every day so sometimes the claims are um
that uh it's causing major deaths people
dropping dead um sometimes the claims
are you know more heart attacks
sometimes more cancer today um on the
vigil and fox um account on X there's
another study uh epid epidemiologist
Nicholas holer reported that uh the
vaccinated have you know way higher
depression and way higher anxiety and
way higher Sleep
disorders and I don't know what's
true so my take on all covid related
data is that none of it is
credible not the stuff that says you're
safe and not the stuff that says you're
not now one of them is
true it's either safe or it's not and
when I say safe I mean safe for a shot
right so every kind of medical procedure
tends to be bad for at least a few
people so not completely safe but but uh
I have no
idea so here's a little experiment for
you find your favorite
Ai and ask your AI if there are any um
any problems with people who are
vaccinated in terms of more cancer more
heart disease more mental illness or
anything whatever you want just ask your
favorite AI so I asked perplexity
because perplexity is like really good
and you know what I said he said there
are no known health problems from the
vaccination Beyond you know there's
always a few people who who have a bad
reaction to everything no unusual bad
reaction do you believe that it's from a
search
engine yeah I I'm pretty sure that no
matter which search engine you asked it
would say that the vaccination was as
safe as anything else we do in the
medical
world now I'm not saying that's true I'm
saying that the AI will tell you it's
true and at the same time I will wake up
and every single day there's another
expert telling me that it's like just
killed millions of people and they're
dropping like flies and they're going
crazy and they're getting you know early
onet of every thing in the world
which of these is
true let let me just say this if you're
sure you know which one of those is
true you shouldn't
be you shouldn't be because there's
really no way to know I I don't believe
there's any way to know you could you
might be guessing right because one of
them is right right it's either
perfectly safe or it's way more
dangerous than we we thought it was it
can't both true so somebody who's
watching this is completely correct but
not because you could know it's just
it's a 5050 so some of you are going to
guess
right um I'm
genuinely genuinely confused I cannot
tell if there's even any way to know
right so in the comments I'm saying is
there even any way to know and the
trouble is that everybody who studies it
seems to have some motivation
they're either starting at looking for
trouble and oh they found it or they're
starting it making sure that there is no
trouble oh we didn't find any trouble so
I think everybody in that domain is
motivated one way or another even if
they're not aware of
it um I'm seeing somebody yell in all
capitals it has random effects because
it goes to random parts of your body now
if that were true and it might be then
you would see that um everything would
be increased in terms of um bad Health
now when I asked perplexity after it
said you know there's no indication that
the shots have any problems at all I
said but is it true that there's a big
increase in health problems and he said
yes there is in just the last few years
there's a major increase in a whole
range of health problems and so then I
asked
why what's causing this major change in
health problems do you know what it
said
lifestyle is said that in just the last
few years there's been enough of a
lifestyle and demographic change and
demographic that uh explains what we're
seeing do you believe that now part of
it is in any 5-year period uh America
gets a lot older because we're not
replacing with young people as as fast
so it should be that if everything was
working properly that every year from
now on there will be much greater health
problems than
usual because we're
older right so if I were to predict will
next year have more health problems more
more heart attacks more diabetes than
last year almost
certainly right there's no way it's
going to be less next year cuz we don't
have cures for it and there will be more
old people eating junk food and our our
food is probably getting worse and you
know social media's turning us into the
couch
potatoes anyway so um I don't know I
have no
idea and that ladies and
gentlemen concludes my prepared thoughts
for today and I think you can see the
problem I can't trust any data I can't
trust any
video and everything's racist against
white people white men
mostly so that that's your world and I
don't know what any of those U uaps are
but I'm not worried about it I've
decided not to worry about the
uaps and just not worried
about all
right uh the answer to your question is
yes but I don't want to tell you what
the question
was this is
BS I like the all capitals people so I
can mock
them uh This is BS you people are
letting him not look at the
data and call it bad okay you sound
drunk are you
drunk the the all capitals people I just
assume are are elderly and
drunk
um all right just taking a look at your
comments not trusting data is the same
as not looking no if you don't trust it
there's no point looking at it there's
no point looking at what you don't
trust if you came to me today and said I
am the greatest epidemiologist in the
world my reputation is spotless here is
my randomized control study do you know
what I would say I'm not even going to
look at it because we're not in a world
where anybody's randomized controlled
study has any credibility at all in that
domain maybe some other domain it might
