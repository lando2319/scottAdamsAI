come to the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams
because
I'm Scott Adams and there will be coffee
if you'd like to take this experience up
to the maximal possibility and I'm
talking white board is coming kind of
level not even the normal amazingness of
the live stream usually we're actually
going to take it up a whole other level
and if you'd like to be part of that all
you need is a copper mug or a glass
attacker Chelsea Steiner canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day it's the
thing that makes everything feel better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
I felt a few of you missing the mark
there
some of you were a little slow next time
next time I want you all be on point
okay
but it was still very good
it was very good just I think you could
take it up another level there were a
few of you I could sense
somebody in Iowa
two people in Great Britain and
three people in Florida who were not on
time with the rest of you
I could feel that yeah I can feel it
let's talk about the news
uh so Kerry Lake did not win in Arizona
she will not be the governor instead the
governor will be somebody who won a
suspicious election election in which
she was the one in charge of counting
the votes
so the person in charge of counting the
votes one and a
suspicious way I'm not alleging any
cheating happened I have no evidence of
any cheating whatsoever want to be clear
about that because I'm no election
denier
I'm just saying that from the outside
there might be a few questions about the
delay and the way things went and the
fact that the person who counted the
votes won in a narrow match oh
what could go wrong
so here's my note to Democrats
pretty happy about that
you're pretty happy that Carrie Lake's
not going to be a governor
good luck with that
because if you don't know what's coming
for you could have a nice surprise
Carrie Lake just got freed from her
little State cage
you don't let the Kraken out of the
state cage
if you could keep her in the
governorship you could at least keep her
out of the way a little bit right but
they just released her to the National
level it's the biggest political mistake
of all time
oops
um I don't know what's gonna did was
Trump allegedly getting announced today
did that change
at 9 pm
all right here's what I'm going to
predict for Trump's announcement
prediction
he will announce he's running because
he's trump it would be insanely amazing
if he decided that he would tell you
instead he's going to back a different
candidate
like that would just blow your head off
and and he would go into the George
Washington
you know animals of greatest presence
I'll I'll even go further if Trump
decides that for the good of the country
he's not going to run
he would be our greatest president since
George Washington maybe second second
greatest would you agree
as as a prior supporter of his who has
been disappointed in a number of areas
as many of you have
If he if he'd stood down
and said for the good of the country
this doesn't work it's not 2016. you
know I showed you what works I showed
you it doesn't I'm going to take myself
out of the mix
now
if you and I had this decision could we
do it
if you were in this situation could you
make that choice you with your
personality you're not Trump could you
do it
I can do it yeah I think a lot of you
could do it
do you think Trump could do it
do you think Trump can do it
I'm going to tease you a little bit
he actually could
and do you know why he could
because he's smart enough
to know that it would cement him as the
second best president of the whole
 United States
in many people's view in my view that
would put about a Reagan
I liked Clinton as a president I liked
him a lot actually
but it would put him ahead at Clinton
for sure
now that's just my view
so I can't guarantee you that you know
he wouldn't be discredited in the
history books or anything else so I
can't guarantee my view is common
but I don't expect them to do that do
you does anybody expect him to do
anything except announce
so let's make our prediction based on
the fact that you will announce okay
so here's my prediction within that path
if he goes that path
he's going to tease
that Carrie Lake could be his vice
president
you won't say it because you don't say
those things ahead of time but he's
going to tease it
and if he teases it
all bets are off
there's just nothing that would be the
same after that all bets are off and and
here's the thing that
uh makes Trump hard to support at the
moment
there are a number of things that make
him hard to support but one of the
things is we don't see a moderating
influence on him
whereas Ivanka was a moderating
influence
didn't you think so
I mean I think she was there
I I think Trump put her there not just
because she was a trusted advisor but
then she was like an external conscience
right like the the one person he would
he would listen to
and if she disagreed with him I think he
took her seriously
and maybe not too many other people like
that
so if you don't see a moderating
influence on Trump
he's a little dangerous looking isn't he
right you needed that little bit of just
certainty that Jared and Ivanka
you know they'd quit they would have
resigned I think imagine how
embarrassing that would be imagine
having your daughter resign
because she doesn't agree with your
Administration right so avocad actually
um
a super important role for the country
not just for trump it was more for the
country and I don't think that'll ever
be fully appreciated now I'm speculating
because I wasn't you know I'm not behind
the scenes but it feels like it now
imagine Carrie Lake as his vice
president
I hate to say this but she's a far
better Communicator than Trump
now he gets more energy and more
attention and that's You could argue
that that puts him above but in terms of
forming a sentence that won't get you in
trouble but fully pushes your point
Carrie likes better
one of the best we've seen right she's
she's actually unique
if she were if she were on the team
and you consider her a full partner in a
way that Pence never felt like a full
partner did he
didn't you imagine that when Pence gave
advice to Trump that Trump listened and
then and then endured it I don't know I
mean I I have a very high opinion of
Pence as a vice president
I think he was one of our best vice
presidents I think he was tremendous in
a really hard difficulty job he excelled
like that that's where you have to give
him the credit he had the hardest job in
the world
and he excelled he was great
I don't I don't want him as president I
don't think he's quite got that Vibe but
wow you got to give him credit for
Service to America
uh but I think Kerry Lake would have the
credibility and the skills that Trump
would respect her skill level
because he can see it right everybody
can see it if he respects her skill
level he's he's tempted to listen to her
and especially on the election denier
stuff
I believe that she could craft that into
a message that actually worked
in a positive way
it's easy
right it's easy
you just say we don't know there's no
there's no proof of any fraud
step one
right it's not that hard
no fraud has been proven
but the way our system runs it doesn't
give us confidence
nobody can argue about that there's not
nothing's been proven but the way our
system runs it doesn't give us
confidence that has to be fixed
so let's forget the past but figure out
how we can fix it
how hard is that
but that's something that Trump isn't
going to do
Trump will never say it that way right
but if Kerry Lake says it that way
which is what the vice president does
the vice president if you didn't know
this the vice president tests messages
in the campaign If the message works
then the top candidate says oh yeah
that's that's the message and if the
message doesn't work then the top says
well you know I'll get the vice
president on board that's you know vice
president was talking for her himself
right
so Kerry lake is the perfect person to
test a message
that Trump can learn from and then adopt
do you think Pence was that person
do you think Pence ever said something
that Trump said oh that's a good way to
say it I think I'll copy Pence
probably never
and again I have a very high opinion of
patents is communication skills are
extraordinary very good very good
but not the kind of person who
necessarily is going to influence you
all right
so uh yeah that would change everything
keep an eye on that however we're also
in the situation where as I tweeted
earlier that fetterman could be any
Republican in 2024.
with a current setup they have nothing
changed like it's just straight line
from here to 2024
no joke
this is not a joke
now I don't think you'll run obviously
but Phentermine could be them why
because all that matters is that your
team wants that more than they want the
other thing that's all and they would
if they're willing to achieve
Phentermine as a serious National
candidate for Senator what would stop
them from pretending he's presidential
material
amen by that he would be much recovered
right you might even be able to form
sentences without a teleprompter or
understand sentences
so
I don't know what you do about that
you know I think we're all coming to the
understanding that it's the mechanism of
the vote that always determines who wins
and right now the mechanism which is you
know sort of leaning toward ballots and
voting at home and stuff that mechanism
strongly leans toward Democrats I don't
see anything that's going to change it
do you I don't see Republicans
suggesting or doing anything that would
make any difference to that
do you
so I don't see any way that uh a
republican could win in 2024 with the
current setup
but there will be lots of changes
between 20 now and 2024. so that's not a
prediction
right my prediction is always that
everything will change when I give you a
straight line prediction I'm telling you
that's the thing that probably won't
happen
because the straight line predictions
are the ones that are the most rare it's
rare that nothing happens
right
but it's interesting to know what the
straight line will look like all right
we got to talk about FTX the big crypto
exchange where that young guy
was a big old multi-billionaire and I
guess he was the third third biggest
donor to the Democratic party and turns
out he was still in all the uh the money
from the clients and it was a big old
scam and so it's all fall falling apart
so here are the sub stories that have
come out of that
turns out this is way more interesting
than I was expecting
this has everything
like if you're looking for a story that
has everything oh this has it this has
got everything so here's just just a
hint of what's Happening
so the New York Times does this major
piece uh about the FTX Scandal and and
Twitter just is just uh it's just
kicking their ass because they do a
major story and here are the topics
which were not mentioned in a major
story about FTX
uh fraud crime uh substance abuse uh
connections with
blah blah stolen funds wipe servers
so the New York Times does a major story
about this guy who was a who is a
gigantic Democrat donor
they treat it like it's like some
ordinary business problem where he lost
his money or something
like completely losing the so Twitter uh
Twitter noticed and started dumping on
them but that led me to another
fascinating thing
that uh so I saw a tweet by uh Balaji uh
SRI divasan now I'm telling you you need
to follow him on Twitter
right here's one where just listen to me
I don't don't argue just listen to me
just follow
Balaji srinivasan on Twitter just do it
okay I'm not even going to tell you
reasons
just do it
all right so here's one of the things
that he tweeted today and I didn't know
about this he said the New York Times is
covering up Sam bankman Fry's crimes
nothing uh SBF says can be trusted
nothing New York Times says can be
trusted either
but dunking does nothing you know that's
what the other Twitter users were doing
they're trying to dunk on the New York
Times he says lies make traffic rise you
do have one option though Mass block
them all in one go and then he gives a
URL that's uh block New York times.com I
guess and uh
so there's an actual app
that blocks uh all the employees I think
probably the writers for the New York
Times
so you can't see anything the New York
Times produces
isn't that hilarious
now I'm not going to recommend that you
use it I'm not going to use it because I
don't want to see everything
but I love the suggestion the the the
let me put it this way
imagine you had a job
of reporting the news
that's your job not only do you have a
job of reporting the news but you're
considered the standard
you know you're the newsmaker you're
you're the cream of the crop and yet you
do your job so badly that somebody spend
time to make an app to make sure nobody
sees it
that actually happened
imagine your uh performance review so uh
how'd you do here run in the New York
Times well
uh so poorly
that I'm the only news entity in the
world that somebody had to build an app
to avoid accidental exposure to it
the app
lets you avoid accidental exposure to
the New York Times
because it's so dangerous
and none of that's wrong
none of us wrong
right
that that's an actual app it's a real
app people are actually using it
and it does exactly exactly what it says
it prevents you from seeing fake news
sort of
just sort of sit here for a moment and
just process that
it's the New York Times
and somebody made an app to prevent you
seeing it so you'd be protected from
fake news and that's all real it's not
just real that they're doing it it's
real that it works
like it actually prevents you from
seeing fake news
and again I don't recommend it I don't
recommend it you know Balaji does and
that's fine but I don't recommend it I
think you should see everything I'd
rather see them dunked on than ignored
but how fascinating did that exists did
you know that there is a
there's a whole social media platform
it's huge that is dedicated to nothing
but giving bad relationship advice
do you know about this
is like huge oh Scott I don't even know
how many users but like a god awful
number of users and the entire thing is
dedicated to giving bad relationship
advice it's called Uh Instagram
Instagram have you heard of that
Instagram yeah
uh
have you spent any time looking at the
relation experts on Instagram
it's terrible advice
and they all have this really annoying
uh confidence
it's the confidence that kills me
that it's usually people in their
30s
it seems to concentrate around there
maybe maybe some early 40s and they're
quite experts in relationships because
they were married once
or they're not married or something I
don't know how in the world do they
become experts
Lance says is Scott trying to get a new
wife on Instagram
now
I I think I gave my answer to that
yesterday I won't repeat it
um
but do not take relationship advice
from Instagram
here's another person you should not
take Instagram advice or you should not
take relationship advice from
Jordan Peterson
anybody want to push back
do not take relationship advice from
Jordan Peterson
by the way Jordan Peterson is a National
Treasure
I have a super high opinion of his
intelligence and his value to the
country
he has one blind spot that's dangerous
I'd love to talk to him about this I
finally found something that I could
disagree with him I never wanted to
um you know interview him more vice
versa because I didn't have anything to
say
you know I generally agree with what he
says and then there's nothing to talk
about
but
uh he's very pro-marriage
and he has strong Arguments for it
because he has strong Arguments for
everything he argues but his blind spot
is it's just not going to work for 80
percent of normal people
Jordan Peterson is a high functioning
person who I probably just guessing
probably married a very high functioning
other person
and they may be just the kind of people
and they may have played it just right
to make it work maybe I don't know but
what I know for sure is advice that fits
people who are in the just the right
situation isn't going to fit for many
people
let let me let me give you another uh
context here
so I've been married twice
both of them ended you think that's a
failure I think that you see it as
buying a wife I see it as renting
and I never thought that either of them
would last frankly I mean I tried I
wanted them to so I you know I put 100
effort into making the last but I didn't
expect it
because I live in the real world
and other people change and it's just
not a model that works for everybody in
the long run
so here here's my take
my first wife and my second wife had
something in common
they were very high functioning people
meaning if you had a problem to solve
call them they're really good at solving
problems you know they're very smart
both very capable you know want a
successful entrepreneur you know you
know one has got that instrument rating
and aircraft instrument rating you have
no idea how hard that is uh classic
pianist right so we're talking about
really high functioning people now I
like to think of myself
as a high functioning person as well you
know educated you're reasonable not
insane
and and as I said to both of my wives
while I was still married
if the two of us can't make marriage
work
there's something wrong with marriage
that's hard to say because you're not
you're not designed to acknowledge that
you're designed to think that marriage
is great and if you didn't make it work
there's something wrong with you or the
person you picked right
we just automatically say marriage good
if you failed you're not as trying as
hard as Jordan Peterson is
if you could try hard like Jordan
Peterson you would be successful too no
no
if you put me and either one of my wives
on any other project and said make this
work
how do you think that would have turned
out
really well
because either one of my prior wives
plus me could make almost any
thing work just about anything
we made every other thing work right
every other aspect of life everyone
we made money work we made you know kids
stuff work we made safety we were
healthy absolutely every other thing
that you have to work on WE nailed it
but just this one thing
we couldn't make work twice two
different times with me
you have to you're going to have to
start understanding this it's the system
right it's not you
well give yourself a break
like I I have a pretty high opinion of
my ability to solve problems if you
throw me into almost any environment
I do well
you can throw me into weirdest
situations I'll do well but I couldn't
make that work not even close it was a
system
all right
I talk about that too much
all right more about FTX
um here's the most important part is I
wondered uh how does somebody like this
Sam bankman fried character who was
ahead of uh FDX how where does he come
from
and I thought about it and I got it
uh allegedly his parents are well known
but I'm not sure that's real news
here's who I think his parents are
mom
dad
Sam
we'll do it again
mom
dad
Sam
I think I nailed it
took me all morning to figure that one
out all right
um more about FDX so even Ken Griffin
who is uh one of the top donors to the
Republican Party
was saying that uh
uh well apparently there are some strong
connections between all right let me
give you the whole conspiracy theory
I'll just lay out the conspiracy theory
okay
this is not me telling you this is
exactly true
because you should have high skepticism
about this next part
but the facts appear clear
would you agree that the United States
gave a lot of money to Ukraine of course
you would
we also now know that Ukraine gave a lot
of money to this FTX company
interestingly
and then the FDX company gave another
gave the money back to the Democrats he
was he was the third biggest owner and
it was enough money to affect the
election it was that much money
so the Democrats give money to Ukraine
Ukraine gives it to FTX FTX gives the
money back to Democrats
now I believe that those facts are in
evidence
is did they now what what's not in
evidence is intention
let's be clear
the the nobody has provided any evidence
of intention
it's just those entities connected in
that way
but the effect of it
was money laundering
right doesn't mean it was a crime and it
doesn't mean anybody thought of it in
those ways but that's what happened
America sent it to Ukraine Ukraine sent
it to a fake entity the fake entity he
sent it to the Democrats and the
Democrats got reelected
now apparently there's also a line on
the FDX balance sheet this is what Ken
Griffin said
there's a line on the balance sheet
that is labeled
Trump lose
it's on the balance sheet
Trump lose in other words
they were so political
that even their balance sheet had a war
fund for defeating Trump just like any
normal company right
that don't most companies have a line
labeled on their balance sheet for which
political person they want to defeat
very normal stuff
no not normal
so as Kevin Griffin says cryptically
this is something you want to look into
I'm paraphrasing but when somebody is
Rich As Ken Griffin looks at a balance
sheet
you listen right
let's put another if somebody else looks
at a balance sheet you go well whatever
but if Ken Griffin looks at a balance
sheet and says you need to look into
this you better look into it that's not
an ordinary person telling you to look
into it you better look into it
and apparently uh
I mean the and I guess the number two
person
at FTX is sort of a ghost you know
there's not much press about him but
apparently he had all he worked for Bill
Clinton
let me say it again the number two
person at FDX
was a staffer for Bill Clinton
right so these two guys and uh and Sam
bankman Freud's mother is a huge
Democrat operative right
so he is he is as Democrat as you could
possibly be
and
it's all connected
so we don't know what this will be when
we get to the bottom of it but wow
um now I have this advice for you
you should never never do not ever judge
a man by his haircut
don't do that
never judge a man by his haircut
but if you did it would have worked out
for you
now that's probably a coincidence but
don't judge people by their appearance
I'm just saying that if you did
you would be a really good predictor of
things
and that's just a coincidence so don't
do it
don't do it again no matter how many
times it's worked in the past
sure it's worked every time you've tried
it in the past but there's no science to
it don't do it
Boris Johnson
um
there's uh some new science about how to
make mice more selfish
oh I guess there's more to it I get they
weren't really just trying to make mice
selfish they were testing to see if uh
maybe humans
could be influenced to be more generous
uh because they could make they can make
mice more selfish
you know they won't share their food or
uh more willing to share and they they
know what to tweak in the mouse's brain
they do believe there's a high chance
that they could tweak the same thing in
a human's brain
so they could tweak something in your
brain and that would make you more
selfish or less selfish
well how is that possible
what about your your free will
what how could you have free will
if changing the brain structure
changes how you act
that doesn't make sense
all right there's a big big big thing
coming down the road towards Humanity
that is completely invisible to you
and most people because if you don't
have sort of a background or an interest
in that field you've just completely
missed what's coming
the biggest mind in all of human
civilization
is barreling toward us
at 100 miles an hour and it's going to
happen in the next three years
It's a combination of this kind of
science where we can prove that you can
make somebody do anything just by
tweaking the brain so where does that
leave free will
if you can change the physical part of
the brain and it guaranteed will make
you act different where's your free will
obviously it doesn't exist
then we're going to have ai that acts
exactly like a human and we won't know
what Consciousness is anymore
because the AI will have it
it will it doesn't
but it will for all practical purposes
you won't be able to tell the difference
from the outside
and it will even report that it does
have Consciousness it'll tell you it
does it'll tell you what it feels
and that's all you'll know you also so
you've got AI you've got robots you've
got this kind of science
um
all of it's leading to the same place
you know our most basic assumptions
about who we are as a species it's all
going to be gone in three years and I
don't know what that does
I have no idea where that leaves you
because your entire like sense of who
you are determines everything you do
and your sense of who you are is going
to be obliterated
and don't be surprised if the simulation
gets a lot more attention as well
because the simulation would suggest
that everything you know about who you
are is wrong as well by the way uh Elon
Musk mentioned the simulation again this
morning
I didn't understand his tweet but I
liked it because it mentioned the
simulation
well it turns out that the proud boy is
the number two guy in uh in the
organization was an FBI informant as
were several other people in the
organization
as well as several other uh so-called
extremist organizations I'm not sure the
proud boys are extremists but the the
groups that are extremists
if if any of them are uh had a bunch of
FBI in them now a number of people were
worried
that we might have a civil war is
anybody worried about a civil war
yeah I don't think there'll be a Civil
War and here's why I don't know if these
extremist groups have enough FBI
informants to get that going
right
like I still think you know you're gonna
have a meeting of one of these groups
and like one of the informants will be
I've got an idea
and then the others will look at them
what the
fight with people that wouldn't want to
take over no capital
for the first FBI hey let's take over a
capital second person says I suck at
that that's a great idea well now it
gives you pause but still not enough to
make you take over a capital
I think out of a group of 10 people
you might need maybe seven FBI agents to
get a good
get a good uh Capital takeover going
uh five to seven
and I feel like the FBI informant ratio
to extremist is probably in the 30 range
and I think you'd have to get that up to
like 50 to 70 before they could have
enough energy to get the the Civil War
going so I think the FBI is a little a
little underpowered now they they don't
quite have the juice to make that happen
so don't worry don't worry
uh there is a rumor on the internet that
I backed DeSantis because I said some
good things about him wrong
let me say as clearly as possible I do
not back DeSantis for president
which is different from saying he might
be a good one
I don't know maybe I do not back him I'm
a single issue voter
single issue and I'm going to be a
maniac on that I'm not changing
so if uh let me say this as clearly as
possible
if John fetterman ran for president in
2024 and he was the only one with a real
fentanyl plan I would support John
Federman and I'm not joking I'm not
joking
you got that I'm going to be a maniac on
this there's no backing down
right
uh yeah no seriously I'm not lying I
would back fetterman if he had a real
now the odds of that are zero right
so it's not real
but I would I would
so don't be surprised if that happens
well you should be surprised if that
happens you should be surprised if
Federman runs for president
but if he did that part doesn't surprise
you all right um
is it my imagination or does the name
DeSantis
have too many of the letters for sanity
in it
like DeSantis sanity santis sanity
is it weird that he's considered the
option to Trump
like that's a little too perfect isn't
it
oh you see Satan I suppose it's like a
Rorschach test right you either see the
sanity or Satan
yeah it could go either way
all right I think a fentanyl plan is the
minimum requirement
for a politician to prove that they give
a about the country
any politician who's running without a
serious fentanyl plan and I don't mean
border security and increasing the
penalties for for dealers that's 10 of
it right but
but any politician who doesn't have a
serious plan whether it's Kerry lake or
Trump or anybody else they're below the
level of giving a about the country
those would be people who are running
for their own purposes
if you want to run for my purpose
and I would say that your purpose is
well well maybe you pay attention to the
biggest problem
if you're not paying attention to the
biggest problem that's killing young
people
 you
well why would I give you my support you
got to do the minimum you know at least
at least show some interest in the
country just a little bit of interest in
the country that's all
all right
I've been watching with amusement and
interest as Mike cernovich is trying to
bury Trump at least as a candidate
um and he points out Mike pointed out in
a few degrees today that eight GOP
primaries were DN DNC back to Trump
candidates so that's where the Democrats
did the dirty trick of backing a
republican because they thought it would
be the worst one because it was somebody
who supported Trump and sure enough
that strategy you worked uh Trump was
two for 16 in the toss-up races now as
Mike servich points out
we should not be looking at the races as
somebody won somewhat easily you know
the big like uh or habit you should look
at the the close races where there was a
real Trump factor and then the close one
where Trump was a major factor he only
won two of 16.
now somebody else may interpret this
differently so I'm giving you one take
um
here's my question to you
does Mike cernovich have the persuasive
power
to prevent Trump from uh
winning a nomination
I see yeses and I see no's
all right who would be the most
qualified person to answer the question
who who in the entire world would be the
most qualified to answer the question
could Mike sernovich stop Trump from
succeeding
it's me
it's me there's no there's nobody's
close
it's totally me
and the answer is yes yes he could
yeah Mike serovich does have the toolbox
that if he wants to push it it looks
like he does he could prevent Trump from
getting the nomination
now that doesn't mean 100 like I'm not
saying oh it's it's locked but he does
have the ability yeah and I know you
don't believe that
but you did believe I'm the best person
to judge it didn't you and I wouldn't
lie about it well I don't have any
reason to
right
no you might be surprised and I would
argue that there are a number of people
who could stop him so servich would be
one
who else could
who else if they went total anti-trump
could just stop him
Ivanka
right if Uncle could stop him in
heartbeat all she'd have to do is say
I'm not going to support this it would
be all over
you saying chill dini well maybe
Tucker
I don't know if the pundits can stop him
and here's why
people would expect the pundits to
support him if he got nominated
wouldn't you do you think Fox News would
not support Trump if he got nominated
I think they would
I think I mean I don't think they're
going to go Democrat and they're not
going to send it out
so
I don't think that the fox personalities
could stop it with the exception of
Hannity
Hannity might be able to stop it
see Tucker is interesting because he
goes he'll go wherever the news is right
you know Tucker can you know he's like a
more flexible character but
if Hannity who's actually good friends
with the president if Hannity decided to
now support him like Hardline
abandon bannon's another one
um could Ben Shapiro stop him
well what did Shapiro say he's not he's
not pro-trump at the moment right if he
ever was I don't know if he ever was
yeah
all right so let's just take the people
we know
so suppose Fox News is against Trump the
daily wire is against Trump I don't know
if they all are but you know let's say
bad news
um
cernovich is against them
and I'm not supporting him
because he doesn't have a fentanyl plan
Candace Owens Candace Owens is saying
he's not giving us enough
do you think do you think that Trump
could succeed with those personalities
against them
I don't think so
I don't think so
yeah I don't think he could
but do you think see here's where a
prediction doesn't work do you think you
could change your mind
do you think Trump could change the
minds of all of these people yes yes he
could
do you think you could change Mike
cernovich's mind
no
no he might be the only one who whose
mind you couldn't change he might still
you know in the end he might have to
make a practical choice about you know
who to support if it comes down to two
people in the end but I don't think he's
not he's not the kind who's just going
to go with the politics
yeah yeah I don't think I don't think
they're going to go full Biden that's
for sure but fewer people might vote
that's that's the thing
all right
um
uh Ali Alexander had an interesting
article today and was it the spectator
or something I don't know I forget which
publication
um but he makes a strong case that only
Trump can win the primary
because you know given given all the
noise about the midterms Etc
Trump still has a commanding
lead and there's nobody close the
sentence isn't even close
so it's over right because Trump will
win the primary
and then everybody who says oh my God we
can't have a Democrat they're going to
say well we don't want Trump but we only
have this one choice except for
Democrats
so the Ali Alexander argument is strong
that's a strong argument the polls
completely back up at least point that
that it doesn't matter what the experts
say
the numbers of the numbers and Trump has
a huge commanding advantage over every
other competitor so that's the end of it
right if he wants it he says
here's the counter argument
um
well the counter argument is it doesn't
matter who's running because it's just
about the the ballot collecting process
so it wouldn't make any difference
now the counter counter argument here's
here's the new one that I'm going to
insert
Trump plus Kerry Lake
is a monster that nobody has assessed
it's a monster
could be a good monster could be a bad
monster but it's a monster and
if you if you discount the monster
you're not even trying right that's
that's not a good analysis
right when the monster enters the
contest
Anything could happen like that all bets
are off it's monster time right you
might like the monster
so we'll see
um
yeah what else is going on
there's a report
there's a report that uh Putin delayed
the uh the retrieve from Curson and
Ukraine until after the midterms because
he didn't want Biden to have a win
which would suggest
that Putin prefers Trump as president or
non-biden actually it only prefers
it suggests he wants non-biden that's
different
yeah
I don't know what that means I'm not
sure how to
you know how to analyze that
but uh it's interesting I don't know
that Russia they can't stop
can't stop doing stuff to us all right
let's let's talk
um fentanyl I did a thread most of you
know the thread you know that you know
most of you have been educated on Son's
own ways others have not good border
security might be five percent of the
problem
because most of it's coming in tunnels
anyway it's coming in tunnels it can
come by water and so light
the fentanyl is it's so light and small
there's just a million ways to get in
the only reason the fentanyl is being
caught at the border now is that it's
easy
it like it's easy to just drive it
across the border if you close the
border up tight
it's still easy
they just use a different method
such as walk up to the wall
and you you take a little package that's
the size of a softball
and it's enough to kill everybody in the
United States and you say hey Juan catch
and you throw it over the wall to Juan
on the other side that's it there's no
way a wall is going to stop Fentanyl now
a wall might might stop marijuana
it might stop marijuana do you know why
because you can't make money
on marijuana that would fit in your hand
and you could toss over a wall like you
need you need some quantity right
so the wall doesn't work
executing dealers uh I don't think we've
seen the death penalty really change
Behavior too much
but I'm in favor of it it just won't
it's not a solution so those are like
five or ten percent Solutions the only
solutions that I think are possible one
would be some kind of legalization
concept but that's completely screwed by
the fact that the San Francisco uh open
air drug experiment was a disaster
but they focused on like homeless people
and they created a zombie apocalypse in
the middle of a major city
that's not the way to do that
that would be doing everything wrong
right the the fentanyl problem is not a
homeless problem
the sensitive problem is a you know
middle class teenager problem and you
know ordinary people who have jobs and
stuff so that's not the group that's
going to become the the walking zombies
in the middle of the city that's the
group who are functional addicts who go
to their job every day
and you didn't even know they were
addicts so
uh
so the main thing you need to know is
that some people do buy fentanyl
directly some addicts they look for
fentyl and they know they have Fentanyl
if you're an addict and you know you
have Fentanyl
how dangerous is it
still dangerous but they're not the ones
dying of all the overdoses because if
you know what you have and you're sort
of an expert at this because you're an
addict then you know how to do the
things that will reduce the chance
you'll die
and they do so it's the people who don't
know that it's baked into the other
drugs they're buying they think they're
buying Xanax or something and they get
fentanyl and then they die
so
um what will work is not the San
Francisco
open-air drug experiment
but the thing I would test
is a pill substitute not an injection
not an injection a pill substitute for
people who are you know absolutely
addicted
that is the safest you know measured
alternative so it doesn't get you clean
but perhaps maybe you agree to some
counseling or you agree to be exposed to
some options for getting treatment
something like that
um
I think there are things that could be
tested that are so far from the San
Francisco debacle that that's worth
doing I don't know what would work
that's why you test it and the other
thing would be just to mow the lawn in
Mexico as I like to say and the reasons
I say mow the lawn is that we should not
imagine it's one and done
you don't mow the lawn once
you keep mowing the Lawns right and uh
apparently I need a fact check on this
but apparently we can identify where the
fentanyl labs are
can somebody give me a fact check on
that
I I heard it said that we do know where
the fence in the labs are
in Mexico
I don't know if that's true but if we do
we should mow the lawn
just just reduce it to dirt with special
forces and then it'll pop up in another
place right
and then you mow it and it pops up the
mouth and repeat and you just do it
every day until the business model
changes
here's how the business model would
change
oh
if we sell cocaine they don't bomb us
if we sell heroin they don't bomb us
if we see if we sell fentanyl same
profit they bomb us
so do do what kills fewer people and you
don't get bombed
so we could give them an option here's
here's how I would do it if I were
running for president I would say Mexico
uh here's the satellite map of one of
the big fentanyl plants in one week this
is going to disappear
we'd love to talk to the heads of the
cartel about getting out of this
business entirely but we're going to do
this as our opening bid and then you
make it disappear
then you hold up another sign a week
later and say Here's the next fence of
the lab this one will disappear on
Tuesday
now of course they'd be you know moving
their assets as quickly as they can but
you make whatever's left disappear
and then on Thursday here's the third
one this one's going to disappear on
Friday morning it disappears
you can make them do any thing
you want you just have to put enough
pressure on them
all right
that ladies and gentlemen is the
interesting part and now
the Whiteboard
I'd like to share with you my personal
Journey which has been complicated
by people in the news lately
as you already know
I was born a white colonizer
back in 1957 a young child was born and
when in Catskill New York
and uh sadly he was a white colonizer
now to be fair this baby did not
colonize anything
by himself but he is part of a
demographic
that are well known as white Devils
white colonizers white supremacists dare
I say and I didn't want any part of that
I thought to myself I don't want to be a
white colonizer sure I haven't
personally colonized anything but still
so I decided to identify as black I did
this several years ago I did it for the
benefits with all due respect by the way
I love the black community I'm happy to
associate with them black lives matter
so and like all the people who were
applying for college is it one-third of
uh
white kids applying for college or
identifying as black now to get the
benefits all right so I'm looking for
that kind of benefit
but then it got complicated
here I am identifying as black and then
Connie tells me I'm a Jew
so I started as a white colonizer
I identified as black
Kanye re-identified me as a Jew
but then they're
there are other black people
who are telling me that the Jewish
people
are actually White colonizers
right back to where I started
you tried not to be a white colonizer
but can you do it no it's like the mafia
you can't get out I mean I I went all
the way from black to Jew to white
colonizer again
ah
is this complicated I don't know what
the rest of you are doing but my life's
all complicated now I don't know who I
am
damn it
all right it's a circle of life yeah
it's a circle of life
um
I'm just letting this one absorb for a
little bit
I'll let you I'll let you live with this
one for a little bit
foreign
I'm having a fun time in a bad way I
suppose uh watching what's happening to
uh Chappelle
and
you know I I get you know I get why the
Jewish Community is uh you know wants to
you know hit him with a brush back pitch
I get that
um
but and part of the part of the reason
for that is people don't understand that
apparently I was you know reading up on
this today apparently there's a fairly
big or growing
anti-semitic wing of the Black American
demographic I wasn't really aware of
that how many of you knew that before
the yay thing how many of you knew that
there was some kind of growing and some
of it might have been based in that
weird little book called
Hebrew what negro to Hebrew or something
Hebrew negro that's that's the name of
the book I'm not saying that
[Laughter]
once you know that context
then you understand why the Jewish
reaction was stronger than maybe some of
you thought it should be
because there actually is a growing
dangerous you know thread of thought
that they're trying to you know they're
trying to stamp it down while it's still
an ember right if we get it in its Ember
form maybe it won't flame up so that all
makes sense so I'd say that the Jewish
Community has uh
responded quite smartly
for
for its interests and probably the world
um they did come down hard
came down pretty hard
but you know
they're also dealing with adults
adults who know how to apologize adults
who know how to learn things adults who
know how to you know clarify
so they're dealing with adults so I
don't defend yay and I don't defend
Chappelle
uh they're adults and they they're
walking into their situation with their
eyes open
but I do think maybe Chappelle he's a
little more awareness which he probably
has by now that uh if you don't deal
with the fact that this growing Ember
could be seriously dangerous you're not
you can't be taken completely seriously
uh you say yay is having a medication
problem well that's no excuse
is it
it might be true but it's not an excuse
we don't allow that you don't you don't
get to be uh
you don't get to be a bigot because
you're on drugs
yeah
all right
uh Chappelle is commentary not Doctrine
yeah that's true
but still we do take him seriously
because he's not just a joker right he's
more of a
he's more of a wise Observer of humanity
all right
uh
hmm can a black man be a bigot
well now you sound like yay
all right let's see
um how's that Civil War going
are you surprised that uh Republicans
are so
uh let's say peaceful
I'm not I'm not really surprised at all
the so far things look exactly like I I
thought they would
we'd have we'd have an election we'd
have a result we'd argue about it the
losing side would say there was some you
know something uh bad
and here we are nobody's marching in the
streets
but but I think the Democrats did a good
job of saying that if you did deny the
election you would get destroyed
so that that probably has a lot to do
with it too
so instead of denying the election
deny The credibility of the elections
that was that for a reframe don't don't
deny the result because we have to move
forward right we can't go backwards in
time you have to move forward don't deny
the result
just accept it
you know you could of course audit and
see if there's any problems but uh go
after the credibility because nobody can
defend the credibility
because you just look at the public and
say well it's not my opinion
here's a poll that says half of the
public doesn't trust the election
that's just the fact
right it doesn't matter if they're right
or wrong you can't argue oh but they
should trust it oh that's not the
solution the solution is not that they
should be smarter
no they are who they are you got to
build a system that works and
credibility has to be the number one
requirement of the system even above
accuracy
here here's the part that really tells
me who you are
if you could have only one of these two
things work perfectly either accuracy or
the public trusts it so The credibility
is high but that the accuracy might not
be perfect you know let's say it's 95
percent but the credibility is 100
everybody says yeah we trust that is
that better
than having accuracy 100 percent
but credibility low
which is better
yeah if you I'm sure every engineer will
tell you the same answer
you build for credibility
and you hope you get the other stuff
right
right you don't build for accuracy
and then say ah I hope it's credible too
that would be a mistake
can anybody back me on this is ready
engineer here who can back me on that I
like a little backing on this
somebody says no you build for liability
and governments don't governments don't
have that kind of liability
now if you were going to put the the
specifications for an election system on
paper credibility would be number one
and you would give up nothing
you you would make no accommodations for
credibility
credibility would have to be 100 and
then everything else like convenience
and how long the line is
can Grandma vote at home and all of
those other things they're below that
because credibility you lose that
you lose everything
right but if your accuracy is a little
sketchy that's just life
yeah how many of you could get used to
the fact that the elections were only 95
accurate suppose they just told you that
you know honestly they're only 95
accurate so these close elections are
just sort of a coin toss
what if they just told you that directly
because that's the truth the truth is
they're they're not accurate enough
to really know who won when a close
election but it's accurate enough to
know it was closed
and I actually don't have a big problem
if the candidate wasn't my first choice
but came so close to the other candidate
then it was sort of a coin to us yeah
I'm not going to complain about the
other person winning because to me
that's the country getting what they
wanted why would I begrudge the rest of
the country get what they want
you know or at least it'd be a tie in
terms of who wondered what
yeah if the GOP can't find real evidence
of fraud
they just look like whining losers
that's true and and that's so far that's
been the Trump approach the Trump
approach has been to look like a whining
loser
and he's still leading in the primaries
so I guess it's working
um
all right
how can you make Democrats think the
elections are incredible
do you want the funny answer to that
how do you make Democrats believe the
elections are not credible
go ahead give me give me the punch line
yeah a republican wins
that's it and we're done
because it's happened every time a
republican won a close race somebody
said it was rigged
right just like Trump yeah elect Trump
re-elect trump and then they won't trust
the election system
hahaha
that's funny
uh oh Peterson said clean up the
elections first yeah
all right
is Biden sick overseas
is there some reporting on that are you
sick
he's on the roof
so so as soon as the election's over uh
Biden's health is going to fail
you know we talked about this if
if it turns out that Kamala uh becomes
president before Biden his term is over
that opens the vice presidency but now
that the Senate
now that the Senate is not going to be
deadlocked no matter what
then you don't have that cool outcome
where the Republicans could keep the
vice presidency unfilled by you know not
approving anybody and uh so we don't
have to worry about that I guess they
would approve a vice president because
it wouldn't change anything
even if Walker wins that doesn't help
anything right
yeah it still could be 50 50. no
I thought we were already past that and
I thought the Democrats own the Senate
no matter what
what are you behind am I behind
I could swear the news said that it's
over and the Democrats own the Senate
no
am I wrong
did I read all of the news wrong
all right I don't know what's going on
here
because I the news I read is opposite of
the news you're reading
what's happening
did I read it wrong
I don't know what's happening here
honestly I'm confused because you
couldn't all be that wrong so it must be
me right
I mean it's more likely I'm the one
that's wrong
all right well I guess I'll do some
research on that
okay
did I miss any big stories
anything I missed
no all right I think so if Trump is
going to announce something tonight at
nine Eastern should I uh live stream
from the man cave
of course I will of course I will yes
and not only will be one of the most fun
man caves you don't get to see the man
caves if you're on YouTube here but the
locals Community gets to see the extra
special content
and uh it's gonna be amazing we're gonna
have a party tonight party on locals
okay
um
I say John says is 50 49 now if Walker
wins come Melissa tie breaker so we
actually could have that situation still
yeah it's nine o'clock Eastern time
correct
all right that's all for now
and I will talk to you
tomorrow
best live stream ever
[Music]
