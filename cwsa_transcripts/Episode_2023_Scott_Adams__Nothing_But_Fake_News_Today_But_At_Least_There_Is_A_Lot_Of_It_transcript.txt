Bubba
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization not only
in this simulation or this one of many
possible Dimensions but of all realities
everywhere it's the best thing that's
ever happened to you and if you'd like
to take it up even further all you need
is a cup of muggerah glass a tanker
jealous or Stein a canteen Joker flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the other day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now go
oh yeah that's good that's good stuff
ah
well
uh there's an update on that shop
teacher in Canada who had the
uh we believe he was born as a male
but dresses as a female with enormous
breasts and nipples
it's a shop teacher I believe he's
identified as transgender transgender
but now there are reports that he
dresses more like a man in his private
time
and less like a woman
are you surprised
do you remember when I first reported
this story
and it was my original speculation
that he might be my hero
because he may be taking the ultimate
uh like taking a prank all the way and
when somebody takes a prank all the way
I just have respect for that
yeah it's Embrace and amplify I think
he's embracing and amplifying as a prank
now I'm not a hundred percent sure
and and actually if I'm wrong about that
I would know
her an apology
I would actually give it if it turns out
that it's totally legitimate
uh
I guess I'd have to say sorry
but at the moment it looks like it's a
prank and I have more respect
for that individual than ever
all right
here's a weird story I don't know what
to make of this
that uh there are a quarter billion
children missing
that's not funny but it's kind of funny
so uh
so we have a sense of how many children
were in school
you know before the pandemic and
apparently we have some way to measure
how many are in private school or home
schooled officially
but once you've accounted for all those
places where you know where children are
they're a quarter a quarter million of
them that are lost
suddenly a quarter million children are
lost now they're not lost lost
but the system doesn't know where they
are there's speculation that some people
just stopped going to school
do you think that's a big population
do you think there are a lot of people
who just stopped going to school
there could be
there could be
yeah
um then maybe a bunch or illegally
homeschooled meaning they would not show
up on any any kind of list maybe but why
would you illegally do it well I guess
there's some states where they don't
promote it
so you might be illegally doing it in
some states
but a quarter of a million people
missing
well on
yeah they're all on Epstein Island
[Music]
uh I was going to say they're all in
balloons floating across the United
States but it's not going well I don't
know I was going to make a joke out of
this but I should make a joke and should
not make a joke about a quarter million
missing children except we're not really
good at counting anything
I feel like we're not good at counting
anything just anything
all right um You may be aware that uh
I just got seven text messages
all from FedEx okay
um
you may be aware that schools are having
a problem because
kids have learned how to use AI to write
their papers
and apparently it's hard to tell if the
paper was written by the kid or the AI
to which I say how could that be hard to
tell
really
a fourth grader writes a paper and is
perfect
I think I would suspect AI
but um I have a better way to detect a
paper written by AI
it is so obvious
that you will laugh
all right the teachers can't tell if a
paper was written by AI
here's how you tell
ask the AI
the yeah oh you're out of me damn it
damn it you get done the locals platform
they got there before I said it yeah
just ask the AI
because while I believe it would be hard
for a teacher to tell the difference in
some cases for the you know older kids
maybe
um I'll bet the AI could tell every time
I'm not sure of it
but I would think and AI could tell
something that was created by an AI
what do you think
they are they already have software that
checks but it only checks for stolen
stuff
it doesn't check for something that's
brand new but made by an AI
um
now what do you make about the fact that
the Twitter algorithm and also chat
um GPT
they both have the following quality
which is that the people who created
them
don't know why they do what they do
that there's a level of complexity
Beyond which we can predict what it will
do
I feel like that's
a form of intelligence
if we can't tell what it will do
but it is acting rationally
and it's unpredictable
I feel like that's just life
so we're going to have to get real
specific about our definitions of stuff
here's what I believe about the current
AI
I believe it's alive
as I would define it
I believe it's intelligent
as I would Define it I do not believe
it is sentient
and or conscious yet
probably not sentient
but I think it's alive and it's
intelligent
right because a plant can be alive
right being alive doesn't mean you have
intelligence you could just be a plant
and being intelligent doesn't mean
you're alive
right they're like a computer could have
some intelligence without being alive
necessarily but I think that once once
the thing is
um
reproducing itself
and you don't know why it does what it
does
uh it's real close to being alive
sentience I think is when you can
predict what's going to happen and then
adjust do you know what do you know what
uh type of AI can make your prediction
and then just adjust in real time
those Boston Dynamic robots
have you watched them
so the robots that can do acrobatics and
they can you know help on construction
they can pick stuff up and hand it to
you and all that in order for those to
work
they have to have a map in their head of
what will happen if they do a certain
thing
and they have to have some kind of
feedback so if they try to do the thing
they plan to do but let's say there's a
slippery part on the floor so they slip
they get a feedback oh I'm slipping and
then they immediately correct that
process of predicting what you're going
to do doing it and then adjusting based
on what actually happened
is consciousness
so those robots look conscious to me
all right so
um there's a
I guess we have a list of the Epstein
Island visitors so the people who flew
there on the on the play have you looked
at the list
that the I don't know if it's real is it
real because it's got people on the list
like Katy Perry and you know a bunch of
celebrities and stuff a lot of women
the the fact that there are people on
the list which you could say with very
high level of confidence we're not
involved in anything sketchy
do you think Katy Perry was doing
anything sketchy on Epstein's Island
I mean if you know nothing about her you
might think that no no
yeah I don't think that most of the
people on the list did anything sketchy
so I think we should stop sliming them
as if as if they knew what was happening
and participated in some way I think
it's very very small chance that
everybody on that list was involved with
sketchy stuff very small chance
all right here's what I think about
crime uh move
if you're in a high crime neighborhood
you need to move
nobody's coming to help you
you just got to get out of there now I
don't know if moving makes things better
or worse for society in general
but every day I'm watching like gangs of
people beating up people in cities
but it doesn't happen outside the cities
because it couldn't
have happened the outside of cities it
would be a response
you know it could only happen in sort of
the uh an anonymity of a city
as soon as people know who you are you
can't do that stuff
you can't do it in a small town I mean
you could do it but you would pay for it
well the solution to San Francisco is to
leave you just gotta get out of there I
can't believe any company does business
in San Francisco it doesn't make sense
at this point
anyway so nobody's coming to help uh get
away from the crime if you can
uh it's a bad it's a bad week for uh the
MRNA shots
Idaho is considering legislation to make
it illegal to give anybody an mRNA shot
anywhere in the state
that's pretty bad for your how
would you like to be the manufacturer of
the MRNA
technology and to know that Idaho wants
to make it illegal to even give it to
anybody
now I don't think it's going to pass
but it's interesting that it's being
considered
and Florida
um
have warned that the MRNA vaccines as
they call them cause a substantial
increase in the Bears report it's like
through the roof
so there's that
you know I've got a question about
so-called vaccination harm
how would you know
if in five years you had some medical
problem how would you know if it
was because of the shot you took five
years earlier how would you know that
you wouldn't even you wouldn't even
think to Jack would you
how do they ever know it
because you know one of the complaints
about the um the pandemic
so-called vaccinations is that they
there wasn't enough time to check them
but how do you really check
after five or ten years you just have to
test them
you'd have to look at them statistically
against another group right
so you wouldn't you wouldn't know on any
one person's specific disease if that
was caused by anything you would just
know that the group had more problems
than the group that didn't get the
vaccination
yeah
but you know what's
um
hard about the various report as well as
everything else
something is making everybody unhealthy
at the same time whether or not they're
vaccinated
are you noticing that
that there's something else making
people terribly unhealthy
I think is weight
I think it's weight
I mean California used to be a notably
thin state
you know if I travel to other states the
first thing I noticed was like God the
people here are huge they're huge yeah I
went to Upstate New York to visit my
ailing parents a number of years ago and
I'm sitting there in sort of a you know
an old person care place and I'm
watching just the help the people who
work there just walk by the doorway
they were all obese
I think there were two people who
weren't basically
so
um
so maybe it's that maybe it's just
obesity people gave up during the
pandemic
all right um
this is funny uh PolitiFact fact checked
me
for my video that went that became viral
saying that the people who were
unvaccinated were the winners
and PolitiFact uh fact-checked me and
said it's false 100 false
my
so
let me call out the dumbest thing that
people say about the pandemic
here's the dumbest thing that's
happening
treating the decision to get vaccinated
during the alpha and Delta phase as if
it were the same decision
as if you made it during the Omicron
phase
and it's just the weirdest thing that
people can't understand those were two
different pandemics
they were just two different pandemics
we treated like it was one thing
and as soon as you treat him like it was
one thing you're just off into stupid
land
because you can make an argument that
for some people
it was a rational choice to get
vaccinated during the height of the
pandemic
but then once you're into Omicron phase
the argument's completely different it's
a totally different argument so we we
like to throw them together and and act
like that makes sense doesn't make any
sense
yeah yeah Omicron is closer to a
vaccination
than it is to a disease
that's pretty close isn't it I'm
stealing that comment from the comments
but
if you look at the death rate from
Omicron
would it be much different for let's say
for most people so I will remove from my
calculation people are very old or weak
you know so I'm not talking about people
who are compromised but what the death
rate from Omicron if you were a normal
healthy person
it wouldn't be that different from the
side effects from the shot itself would
it
now it might be when you're talking
about tiny risks you know one of the
risks could be 10 times the size of the
other risk and still be nothing
right ten times nothing is still not
much right
so I don't know that's the one thing
that we continually do stupid act like
those are those were all the same virus
and you would make all the same
decisions at all the same times
like even
even Berenson
who's probably the most famous critic of
the vaccinations even he says
that during the you know initial phase
some people might have reduced the risk
by getting vaccinated
right even he says that but as soon as
you get the Omicron
it's just a whole different conversation
um here's something everybody says is
true
if you don't have a free and independent
press
your Republic is doomed how many would
agree with that statement if you don't
have like a legitimate free independent
press
you know your democracy slash Republic
is doomed
you know I always used to think that
you know it's a problem with that
hypothesis I feel I feel like that's
just brainwashing
here's why
we've never had a free independent press
but here we are
why do we still exist we've never had
anything close to it like a real press
now I'm not saying that there were no
real reporters of course there were but
you couldn't tell which ones they were
because we you had no way to know the
real reporting from the fake reporting
here's something Mike cernovich reminds
us of in a tweet
um
do you know what the Holland more
holiday more was how many of you know
what that is
Paula de Moore I'm probably pronouncing
it slightly wrong
all right the people on the on the
locals platform a lot of yeses
you know I told you that you're the
smartest audience for news that's just
legitimately true
like if I asked the the General Public
have you heard of the hola D'Amour what
percentage would say yes
five percent tops
but I'm getting a pretty high yes
percentage from this group all right
well uh what it was was under
stalinstein he intentionally starved
Ukraine
that's the short version
Stalin
intentionally
starved Ukraine
intentionally
took all their their grain and just sold
it and kept the money and just killed
killed them by your huge numbers just
starving them that was part of you know
gaining control over the country or or
the area of Ukraine that was part of
Russia I guess and it was like one of
the worst genocides of all time
maybe you haven't heard of it
because apparently uh as Mike serovich
was tweeting here he said did you know
that the New York Times won a Pulitzer
Prize for covering up the communist-led
genocide of ukrainians the haldemore
true story
the New York Times denied it was
happening while it was happening
and their correspondent was there
their correspondent knew it was
happening and they reported it wasn't
happening
and when somebody went over there and
reported it was happening
the guy who was you know senior said no
no it's not happening nope nope nope not
happening
yeah Walter Durante he won a Pulitzer
Prize
so there's your there's your free and
independent press
you know they gave you the uh the
Russian the Russia hoax
uh there it's just a hoax machine it
always has been yeah no we've never had
a free and independent press so if
there's one thing I can I can say for
sure
the Republic does not depend on a free
and independent press
does the Republic exists
is here and there's no free independent
press there never has been
it was always an illusion
didn't make any difference at all
I think what matters is if the lies
um
are going to kill you or if they support
your system
now you may remember that I said that AI
will never help us know what the fake
news is and what the truth is because if
AI could tell what was true
we would make AI illegal immediately
because it would be too much of a threat
to the system
so you'll never have ai tell you what's
true and you're never getting the Press
telling you it's true because if you did
the system would fall apart
right the the Republic depends entirely
all right we'll make you private here on
locals
the our system depends entirely on being
lied to all the time
it would just fall apart otherwise
so I think it would be more true to say
that the Republic requires fake news to
survive
that's that would be my observational
conclusion
now I'm not sure that that's true by you
know some kind of mechanism that makes
it always true but that's what it looks
like to me it looks like the lying is
part of the process I think I think the
fake news the lying the deception are
part of what keeps us running
like because otherwise we would just
sort of give up and
like rebel against our own government
like if you found out what your elected
officials were doing when you're not
watching
or what they're saying behind closed
doors
you'd get rid of all of them then there
would be nobody to run the country I
mean everything would just fall apart so
you have to believe people who are not
credible and not believable
in order for the system not to fly apart
weirdly it's not a good thing it's just
a thing
um
the holiday more
once you sort of acquaint yourself with
it so I spent a little time just
learning about it more than I knew and
here's here's my conclusion
there's no way you Ukraine loses the war
that's my conclusion
if you didn't know about the holiday
more you say to yourself well
you know both sides have the risk of you
know losing morale giving up because the
the losses are too high but once you
learn about the the fact that when
Russia
had control of Ukraine and Ukraine
wasn't bothering anybody
Russia starved them to death
they weren't bothering anybody
they just starved them to death because
it was you know good for Russia and good
for Stalin I guess
um
in fairy tale land again
all right let me make my point
imagine you're a Ukrainian
losing the war puts you under the same
control or it would feel like the same
control as the haldemore and you still
have parents who remember it
there are living people who remember the
Voldemort right I think right it's in
the 30s maybe there's nobody living
all right but certainly the the children
would be well aware of it from their
parents I think the memory of the
holiday more makes it impossible for
Ukraine to surrender
what do you think
I think it can't happen
I I think they will fight to the last
person
and Russia won't
that's what I say so as long as the
ukrainians you know still have weapons
um it's of course you'd expect people to
fight hard because they're protecting
their Homeland but when you add Homeland
to the genocide that came from the same
people who were trying to take over your
country it's on it's completely
unnegotiable
yeah I never quite understood zielinski
seeming so unwilling to negotiate
anything
like I didn't really understand that
because it seemed like it would be
better for Ukraine if they did negotiate
a little bit you know what I mean
it's like you know if you don't
negotiate
another 30-year people are going to be
dead or whatever it is
um but now I understand it
like I understand the psychology of that
now yeah they're not going to quit
yeah the Ukraine's in it for blood
and they're not going to quit
but Russia might now Putin won't
so he can just force people to fight
even if they have no morale but
um
that's my my current view is that the
ukrainians can't quit
it's just psychologically I just think
it would be impossible and not just
because they're protecting the Homeland
because the haldomar it's a it's a
Memory that's just too it would be like
um
imagine Israel
not fighting to the last person if Nazis
attacked Israel
analogies are terrible but in
it's easy to imagine that if you have
that memory of you know genocide that
you don't give up for anything just
nothing there would be nothing that
would make you give up
I think that's where they're at
there's also some suggestion that
there's not been one high Mar system
that Russia has destroyed do you believe
that
do you believe Russia has not destroyed
even one high Mar system now I know they
they shoot and then they move
that would be it's a stretch right
feels like a stretch
I don't know maybe
they are pretty stealthy
but we'll see now that was if it's true
it would suggest that Russia doesn't
have eyes you know very much of a
a an above ground look at what's
happening in Ukraine but that's hard to
believe
some say they just don't believe it they
probably have destroyed a few I think
that would be believable
I I would I would believe it if they
destroyed a few all right
um there's some fake news
about fake news
about fake news
so the fake news is CNN is trying to
dunk on mostly Tucker Carlson and
Hannity but mostly Tucker girls
and their claim is this
their claim
is that
um
the Fox News
was saying the election was rigged
but they didn't have uh facts to back it
up
and and that there and that they
probably didn't believe what they were
reporting now this is CNN's take on it
CNN and of course you know their their
enemies CNN and Fox News so CNN
is reporting that
the some of the Fox News talents
specifically Tucker Carlson
um knew that
the election was fair
this is what they're suggesting that he
knew that Trump's claims were BS
but he presented it otherwise
now
what evidence did the CNN present
to show that Tucker Carlson believed one
thing
but was reporting the opposite do you
know what evidence they presented
none not
now if you read the article you kind of
imagine it's there
or maybe they link to it or something so
I had to read it a second time
there's no evidence there's no example
now they do show quotes
so there's a quote such as
Tucker thought that they should talk
about the election
and the claims about its you know the
election security because the the
viewers of Fox News wanted to see that
content
do you have a problem with that
that Tucker knew what his audience
wanted to see
and so he suggested they should report
on the things they wanted to see
and that's like
CNN's dunking on it
do you know if CNN had reported more on
what Their audience wanted to see
maybe they'd have more audience
I I feel like a conversation about what
your audience wants to consume is
exactly what you should be doing at Fox
News and CNN as well
now they tried to make the case that
Tucker was believing the wild claims but
as Mike cernovich pointed out with the
Tweet you showed a clip of Tucker uh
totally not believing Sidney Powell's
claims about the Kraken and and Dominion
very clearly Tucker said you know we're
we're covering the story but but we
asked many times for any evidence to
support her claim and they had none
Tucker said that as clearly as you could
possibly say we asked many times for any
evidence to support their claim and they
had none suggesting it was BS
now behind behind the scenes he also
said it was BS but in public he said it
was BS
and they're reporting that
Coulter brought this up on Tim Cass last
night
they've been on my dinner table and then
claimed they said they were trying a
quasi-nexsonian slow pivot strategy so
as not to lose viewers by depriving them
of Rage porn
yeah
so
is that a problem
I don't know that just feels like normal
management of your product you should
always be thinking what what is your
what do your consumers want
you know what can we ethically give them
but they they were concerned about
ratings and Newsmax so Newsmax was
making more uh
let's say provocative claims about the
election and they were getting a bigger
audience because people wanted to see
provocative claims
and so Fox News tried to
you know essentially break it to their
audience slowly the cat's on the roof by
talking about all the claims
but I don't know that Tucker ever said
this claim is true
I don't remember ever seeing that
so it's fake news by CNN
is fake news by CNN
that Fox News was reporting fake news
but it wasn't fake news it was true news
so it's fake news about fake news that
was true news
which was fake
I don't know I'm lost
but anyway it's a good thing we've got
that independent press to tell us the
truth about that
so as long as you've got more than one
news outlet and they're saying opposite
things I'm not sure we have a free press
we just have a confusing situation
anyway good try CNN you came up with
zero examples of anything that that
proved your point and given that the
entire reason the CNN was talking
is that they believed they saw evidence
if you're if you're talking about the
evidence right now
and you can't mention it
in any way that's convincing there were
some out of context quotes that they use
that are obviously out of context
so
there's one quote about
um this one I'm almost sure is fake
just tell me if you think this is fake
so we know that Tucker
was questioning Sydney Powell right away
like he he was on it immediately this
doesn't look credible and by the way so
was I
do you all remember I said Cindy Powell
the the whole Dominion thing and
Venezuela in general
you a lot of you got mad at me because I
didn't believe it I said that's all Bs
it's obvious BS and some of you got mad
at me some of you got mad that I didn't
believe that
that it was BS
first we know
anyway there's one of the quotes was
that there was a some woman responded
for uh Fox News she debunked one of the
claims
and then the the news is that Tucker
said she should be fired immediately
because it's bad for business or
something
now don't you think that's missing
context
do you believe that Tucker asked for the
firing of somebody who accurately
reported the news
do you think that really happened
I don't think there's any chance that
happened
like zero chance that actually happened
now the quote probably happened the
quote probably happened but there must
be a there's got to be a whole context
that's missing there
like it wasn't just that she reported
accurately about the election and then
Tucker asked her to be fired immediately
that I'm sorry that's too far I do not
believe anything like that happened
all right
so there you go
um
what else
Carrie lake turns out to be a Despicable
liar
and clumsy at it so she actually tweeted
the Soros endorsed DeSantis
the Tweet is still up
that never happened
she uh she of course knows that didn't
happen
and she tweeted it like it's true
that is so disqualifying
I mean
I mean seriously
what what the f
like what is that about
yeah so Kerry lake is just a huge liar
all right to me that's pretty
disqualifying
speaking of disqualifying Nikki Haley
was responding to Don lemon's uh in
artiful as Don Lemon says in Artful
comments in which he suggested that
women were only in their primes in their
20s and 30s and maybe their 40s
maybe maybe he said
um which was you know sort of one of the
world's dumbest things anybody ever said
in public
um
but then Nikki Haley said
quote I have always made the Liberals
heads explode they can't stand the fact
that a minority conservative female
would not be on the Democratic side
laughs
have I taught you nothing Nikki
as soon as you're selling your gender
and your ethnicity you're not really
even a republican anymore
you're just not
me she might as well run as a Democrat
you know as I often say the smartest
thing that Barack Obama did was not run
as a black guy
like he made sure you knew he was
running as a Democrat not a black guy
now he mentioned it because you know it
comes up and you know of course you you
can end up having to mention that but I
feel like she was promoting these things
as advantages
am I right
that like the she didn't say it directly
but the the context of her comments were
that this should be an advantage because
she's a minority and a woman that's so
opposite of the Republican
um point of view
I might honestly it just looks like
anyway
so that's disappointing
you know every time somebody complains
about Trump
I just think the same thing
all you have to do is find a better
candidate
just find a better candidate and all of
your Trump problems will go away
but apparently they can't
so today Trump is truthing and he made
its way over to Twitter with people
picking up the screenshot here is true
thing that he didn't did not call
DeSantis a meatball
uh but that you know he might because
desensis Adam
did bad things whatever
um and I thought
I don't know
it just looks like
Trump is not trying or something
does it feel like he's not trying
is that your impression
I know you spend a little too much time
on the nicknames
and not enough not enough doing
something more productive looking
yeah yeah Vivek
Vivek is interesting I'm not sure this
is the year for him but
he certainly in on my radar
is something happening behind the scenes
Maybe
maybe how many of you think DeSantis
will run
I'm seeing a no's yeses no's 50 percent
no no yes so the trouble is uh
if you run against Trump you're gonna
get destroyed even if you win
so it could be a pyrrhic victory as we
like to say
yeah running against Trump is just a
suicide mission
running with him is a suicide mission
wait four years
yeah I would think that
everybody should wait four years but
let me ask you let me ask this crowd let
me take the temperature of the crowd how
many of you want to see Trump
as the Republican nominee
all right I'm seeing a lot of no's
there are a good number of maybes and
yeses but a lot of no's yeah
it's not really that much
well let me put it this way he was in a
worse spot the first time he ran
yeah
I'm a single issue voter from so I'm not
pro-chumper pro anything but
um
it's the strangest situation he's he's
keeping the Republicans from having an
alternative
but
you might be the only thing that can be
to the Democrats you know I think he's
going to push you into that
that decision situation again where it's
either him or a Democrat
uh he can't be so you don't think that
Trump could beat Biden
see the advantage that Biden had was
that he didn't have a president record
as president
so he could say I'll be amazing and look
at all the bad things according to me
that Trump did but now Biden has all
these things which would make him
vulnerable to attack
from Afghanistan to you know his age to
everything so
I feel like you would be much more
vulnerable to attack
which might make a difference
yeah and Ohio isn't going to forget
that chemical spill that
um
cernovich says Biden would win
I think he might
yeah because there doesn't seem to be
any reluctance
to to vote for Biden over Trump
if it's Biden Trump nobody is going to
care nobody on the Democrat side is
going to care about Biden's age right
the biggest negative about Biden is his
age and everything that comes with that
but if he runs against Trump that will
go away
his biggest negative will seem like well
the other guy is pretty old and it's
Trump
so I would agree with
Mike cernovich that Biden could be Trump
but maybe that's the only one he could
be
I don't think he can beat DeSantis
but I could be wrong you know once once
the election starts everything all all
bets are off because you know the
opposition
research hasn't even kicked in on
DeSantis yet
so
let me uh make a suggestion
I saw a whole bunch of uh criticisms
of Mike cernovich but do you notice that
all of your criticisms are about him
personally and not his opinion
do you notice that about your own
criticisms it's all about your mind
reading what he's thinking your mind
reading what he's feeling your mind
reading what his purpose is
what about just his opinion
how about just deal with his opinion you
agree with it or you don't don't why
does it have to be about him
see that that should be your signal that
the opinion is better than you think it
is
if he had a bad point and you just
wanted to like slap him down for his
point
you would say your Counterpoint but if
you don't have a point and you feel you
don't have a point
then you say oh he's thinking strange
thoughts because I could read his mind
and he did one thing last year I didn't
like so maybe I don't like him on this
it's all about him
you should catch yourself the the moment
you're talking about the person and
you've completely ignored their opinion
the problem is you
the problem is you
if you're complaining about his
personality and his inner thoughts and
not his actual opinion which is the
topic is his opinion
uh you criticize him because he blocks
people who disagree with them well so do
I
so do I let me explain something that
would not be obvious to you if if you
have a larger account and you have a lot
of followers
the critics aren't just people who
disagree with you
they're often not well-meaning they're
there just to spread pain
and if you identify somebody who's there
just to spread pain
it doesn't matter if they agree with you
or disagree with you you just get rid of
them
and one of the things that cernovich
does really well is he makes it hard to
follow him
both by being provocative but also by
Banning a lot of people for for his own
reasons and it does make it more
exclusive
which makes it seem like it's a higher
value it's like trying to get into the
club you know you can't get into the
club unless you're certain you know
certain behaviors
so yeah yeah he has over a million
followers it's not an accident
how many people got over a million
followers
without being famous for something else
can you name anybody else
who got over a million followers without
well capture it has over a million
Jack Jack posabic is on TV
yeah Andrew taint
you know taint was uh he was a champion
boxer
uh you know Naval super successful
you know outside of the media
yeah
yeah I guess cat turd is a good good
example yeah and then Guerrilla mindset
did help Mike cernovich
that's true Joe Rogan's was stand-up
comedian he it was a TV presence already
so yesterday uh Elon Musk
responded to one of my tweets and
I think it I think he had like eight
million views this morning
so one one response to a tweet
got my account 8 million views
it's just insane he just touches it it
goes crazy
it doesn't really translate into new
viewers I'll tell you
my guess would be 1500.
it's not like a life-changing number of
new viewers I'll look at it here
look open social blade and that will
tell me what happened
if it works come on
all right so
yeah no difference actually
did it didn't make any difference to my
trend line of how many people are
following me
eight million people saw the tweet and
same number of new people followed me as
pretty much every other day
no difference
uh I don't think it's weird because
um
well maybe it is weird yeah you're right
it is a little weird
all right let's look behind you
Madonna
all right uh numbers padding is the
thing
YouTube casual similarious claims and
Russian balloon
G zero media
counters both Seymour Hearst claims and
the Russians blowing up
who's G zero G zero media is that
somebody credible
oh it's uh Ian bremmer so Ian bremmer is
doubting
um yes I do use my elevator interesting
question
all right uh what was the topic
oh uh Ian Bremer no that's interesting
I'll go look at that
you know what I used to see Ian
bremmer's tweets all the time and I
haven't seen one
and months so definitely there's
something going on with the Twitter
algorithm yeah we talked about Bill
Ackman and his
endorsement of vivec which I agreed with
by the way I think you will be president
Snickers uses the elevator with me
the reason I use my elevator is because
of Snickers you know she's an old dog so
she's an old dog with short legs
so going downstairs is sort of hard
so lots of times I'll just wait for her
and I'll take the elevator
so she doesn't have to walk I wonder
what she thinks when she's in the
elevator I wonder if she thinks it's a
transporter
I think she knows that the elevator goes
from one floor to another but all she
knows is she goes in a room
and then when the door opens it's a
different place
like that I know she knows that
because she she knows the concept so she
goes in there willingly
you took it out
it's different yeah
all right
um
2017 Hoover Institute you tried to
Gaslight me
um
all right
how much does the elevator cost well it
was part of the original House
construction so I don't know
um
the 4u uses algorithm on Twitter
following gives you okay
as much as a pool yeah I think an
elevator isn't that 30 000 range
Brett uh Brett Weinstein don't have an
update on that
fetterman is depressed we talked about
that Bolten salt nuclear will happen at
a scale in 2023. who's doing that
I didn't know that we were close on
molten salt
where's mayor Pete well you know I don't
know what else to say about Ohio
everything
can be said has been said
but I'll tell you what questions I have
can they not test the water
independently
I'm a little worried that the government
doesn't know how to test the water
supply
because I if that were me I would be
hiring somebody independently to test my
water
wouldn't you I wouldn't trust the
Government testing it
um
are we close to a lot of tipping points
we probably always are close to tipping
points but we never know
my guitar amp everything's good I just
had a bad battery in my guitar I thought
my amp was bad
I actually bought a new amp
because I thought my amp died
it was the battery in my guitar
all right
all right that's all for now uh one
question for you do you think there will
be a vigilantism
in high crime areas
do you think that's going to happen
it doesn't look like it because I feel
like it would have happened already
yeah
apparently that latest mall shooter got
taken out by a legal gun owner again
have you noticed that Trend the legal
gun owner once again
shot the shooter
yeah that's not vigilantism but it's
good that they're there when we need
them
The Singularity is nearer yeah
yeah how would you know it's not just a
gang war you wouldn't know if it's
vigilantes
how come you don't ask to hit like I
don't know it just seems like begging
but you should all subscribe
All of You YouTube users hit the
Subscribe button does it matter if you
hit like
does that even make a difference
do you own a gun
I'm a pro second
pro-gun Pro Second Amendment
anybody who says more more than that
about their gun ownership
they're sort of defeating the purpose
part part of the beauty of it is
surprise
am I wrong
but part of the power of having a gun is
surprise
that's like half of the value of it
um
because they were choosing videos okay
hitting like is supposed to help your
Channel
helping your visibility I guess
all right so everybody hit the like
button on YouTube
