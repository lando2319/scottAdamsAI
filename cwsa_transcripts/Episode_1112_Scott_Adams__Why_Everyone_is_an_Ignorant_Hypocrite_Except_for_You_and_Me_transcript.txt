hey everybody
here's a little quiz for you what's the
best time of the day
i'm waiting i'm waiting that's right
that's right the best time of the day
is right now and it's happening with
coffee with scott adams and the
simultaneous sap how good is that
what a way to kick off a great day have
you noticed that 2020 has been
generally quite crappy i don't like to
over generalize but i think you'd agree
with me 2020
a little bit crappy things are going to
look up though
i'm calling today the turn today's the
turn
today is the day when there will be
slightly more things going right
than going wrong and watch how the
number of things going right
continues to increase while the number
of things going wrong
continues to diminish 2021 is going to
be lit
off the hook and any other old hackneyed
expression you'd like to put on that
but first the simultaneous sip
what do you need you need a copper mug
or glass a tanker chelsea stein a
canteen sugar flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like
coffee and join me now for the dopamine
of the day the thing that makes
everything better including 20 20.
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now
go
yeah yeah that's working i can feel the
improvement
coming well let's talk about hair gait
what could be more important in a time
of multiple
crises what could be more important than
nancy pelosi's hair
nothing i can think of so let's talk
about that endlessly
so you know the story nancy pelosi went
to a hairdresser
didn't wear her mask when and went
inside where people are not supposed to
be
claimed that her her
her explanation is that she was set up
that the local hairdresser
set her up now even don lemon didn't buy
that excuse
if if you can't sell your democrat
uh if you can't sell your democrat uh
story to don lemon you can't sell it to
anybody
so don lemon even rejected her story
that was pretty funny but here's the
here's the question
unanswered how did fox news get a copy i
think fox news
got it first how did fox news get a copy
of a security camera
in a specific hairdresser
nobody asked that question it's like
so even tucker carlson had the
proprietor on
the uh the woman who was uh owned the
shop that nancy pelosi was at
and uh and tucker never asked the
question
so whose idea was it to give the
security camera
footage to fox news
let's just not ask that question because
that doesn't matter
this is the dumbest story i couldn't
care less
about nancy pelosi wearing or not
wearing her mask
and i get it it's you know hypocrisy and
everything
literally the smallest problem i have
and by the way uh if somebody had told
nancy pelosi
it's okay to be indoors if it's just one
person
doesn't that actually make sense
the whole point of not being indoors is
you don't want multiple people indoors
but if the only people
indoors are the the same person who
would have worked on them if it were
outdoors
i don't know does that make a difference
that you're indoors
it doesn't seem like it was a big health
risk
but i get why people say it's hypocrisy
all right
here's a little uh quiz for you i'm get
it's a
very simple quiz and i want to see if
you can pass it
okay and this this will be a test to see
if i've
taught you anything if i've taught you
anything
you will get this test right and if you
think hey
is there a trick to this well there
might be
there might be so keep keep one part of
your brain alert
for a trick and it goes like this
suppose you had
two opposing armies they all had exactly
the same kind of a gun
no difference same kind of gun whatever
gun it is it's the same one
one army are sharp shooters
and every single person in that one army
hits their target every time they shoot
every time the other army
is not so good as shootings they only
hit their target
80 of the time it's pretty good it's
pretty good right
80 of the time but they're up against an
army that hits their target
every single time literally every bullet
they fire
will hit the other the other army people
you know in a deadly place so they have
a battle
exactly the same guns let's say just to
keep it fun
exactly the same amount of ammo same
guns
same ammo they face off two armies
one is a hundred percent accuracy the
other is eighty percent
who wins the battle go have i taught you
anything have i taught you anything
i'll know in a moment when i see your uh
responses
all right it looks like you're still
talking about the hairdressing stuff
so uh too much of a lag for a group
question yeah there is a little bit of a
lag there
here's the answer to the question
it depends how many people are in each
army
if you didn't get that i've taught you
nothing
and here's why this is important because
the
imagine if you will the army that shoots
perfectly has
five people in it that's it the whole
army it's just five people
the army they're up against who are not
as good as shooting
but they're about eighty percent
accurate has a
thousand people in it it's not even
close
the thousand shooters who are eighty
percent accurate
would destroy the five people who were
perfectly accurate in the first second
the entire art the entire battle would
last
less than a second right
now that's obvious to you once i explain
it isn't it
but when i first set this up you said to
yourself probably
if i set it up correctly well obviously
the people who are better at
shooting if all the weapons are the same
the good shooters should win why is this
important because this is the same
mental trick that is preventing us i
think
from having inexpensive saliva strips
as coronavirus tests so here are the
here's the competing sides we have these
accurate tests that'll get the right
answer really really well
but they're slow and they require a
healthcare professional
and you need some kind of a device
usually
that means that as accurate as you are
you can't do much in other words your
volume is always going to be really low
because the limitations of the testing
device
the one that's not legal yet the fta
doesn't allow it
are these little uh saliva test strips
which haven't been built by the way
you can build them in the laboratory to
know that it's possible
there's not much to the construction of
it so we're not too worried that you
could make them in volume
it's just nobody's doing it because it's
not legal
but let's say those test scripts were
i think it's more than 80 but let's say
they're 85 accurate
but they're a dollar you can do it at
home without a health care professional
and you could do it all day long
you could test every person coming into
the building every person coming into a
sporting event
every person everywhere several times a
day because you get an instant result
cost you a dollar eighty-five percent
accurate
there's no competition
between which of them is the better
method they're not even close
but your your brain first says
why would i ever want an inaccurate test
when i could have an accurate one and
that's why
i gave you the analogy of the two armies
it's just like that
now of course i i teach you quite
famously that analogies are not
persuasive
there's no persuasion going on here
analogies are good for
introducing a new concept if the concept
itself makes sense then i guess in some
sense
you say oh i just learned a new thing
and therefore i'm convinced
but that's not persuasion that's just if
you knew more you might make better
decisions that's all that is
so i use the analogy just to reorient
your brain
to think you have two armies the bigger
army
which is a zillion test scripts that
everybody's testing testing testing
all day long versus these very pinpoint
very accurate tests
that you can't do very many of them no
matter what you do
you just can't ramp them up enough
so uh i still don't know why
we're not doing more of these test trips
i think
it's because somebody doesn't understand
that the big army always beats the small
army
even if they're less accurate but maybe
there's something else
so i'll be open-minded there might be
some excuse or
explanation that i don't know let me
give you an update on my
funniest liberal friend who i debate
just to see what kind of craziness comes
out of them
he told me yesterday he doesn't watch my
periscopes
so so i can speak with complete abandon
now what's interesting about my liberal
friend is not that he's dumb
it's the opposite what makes it
interesting is he's
really smart not even just ordinary
smart
i'm talking about way above average
smart but disagrees with me
completely on you know trump related
stuff
so here here's the tortured path that he
takes
i i try to get him to admit just one
thing
at a time because he likes to do the
laundry list approach
uh and the one thing i'm trying to get
him to admit is that russian collusion
was shown to not exist just that very
one thing and what do you think is his
response
oh no mueller said there was plenty of
obstruction
and what about all those people who did
get charged and went to jail
and what about the fact that the russia
troll farms
tried to interfere to which i say
none of that is russian collusion you
understand that
none of that is russian collusion
and as smart as he is he's conflated all
of those things
into being something that he's willing
to argue
is in the same category of russia and
collusion
but he won't say that directly because
it would be crazy to say it directly
so this is clear cognitive dissonance
because he he existed for i don't know
two years or whatever
thinking that russia and collusion
because he told me was real
once it was proven not to be real or
proven that there's
no evidence to suggest it's real he
couldn't leave it
so he's decided to just redefine it as a
whole bunch of other things that are not
russia collusion
and just call it that and literally just
give it a different name
that is the most classic cognitive
dissonance you'll ever see
but here's the funny part he he accused
me in the same conversation of having
cognitive dissonance
and he gave this this following example
he said
i know you have cognitive dissonance i'm
paraphrasing
because a hundred percent of the time
you just say that trump is right
and since we know that couldn't be
possibly you know
legitimate that trump is just always
right
and everything he does is good that
can't be true
so therefore we have proven that you
scott have cognitive dissonance
to which i said the very email i sent
before this
had a long explanation of me viciously
criticizing the president
on this very question of the test strips
so without prompting
i just viciously criticized president
trump
for this one topic within the testing
category
and immediately after watching that
my friend accuses me of never being able
to criticize the president
to which i say i just did that
i just did that right in front of you
very
very noticeably i made a big point of it
without even being
asked no prompting whatsoever big
vicious criticism
and i noted that i've done it many times
before
it's just pure craziness anyway
um i asked my friend
and i'll ask you the same question so my
liberal friend says there are many
examples of
trump failing in terms of the
coronavirus
situation and so
i try to ask what are those examples and
i'm not
i'm not claiming that there are no
examples
my claim from the start before anybody
has any track record of managing this
crisis
i said at the very first start
everybody's going to be guessing
and so if you're looking back later and
say oh
these people got it wrong you're just
being a jerk
because nobody knew what to do on day
one nobody knew
everybody did different things some were
going to work some weren't it wasn't
because they were smart
it was because everybody guessed
differently and somebody was going to
get a better result
so i asked for specifics and hear that
the types of things i get and i don't
quite understand
here's the here's the biggest one
there's a belief
that if we had been better at testing
early on
we could have in other words if the
president had done something differently
in terms of testing
we could have tested our way to safety
the way
other countries did now can you do me a
fact check
my understanding is that there were no
experts
who thought we could test our way to
safety
in other words my claim and i want to
fact check on this
is that fouchy and berks you know the
two experts that we looked at the most
i believe that neither them thought that
we had the testing facilities
or could get them quickly enough that we
could ever just
test our way out
somebody says wrong again scotty i can't
tell if you're being sarcastic i was
going to block you but i think you're
just joking
um can somebody confirm that
and why is it that i don't i'm somebody
says i'm being correct yeah
so my understanding is if you had a
little island country
and you've got a you know a dozen people
with it
you could pretty pretty well do some
contact tracing in that situation
but i don't think i don't think that our
experts ever told trump
that with the testing we did have what
was possible at the time
again the limitation is we just didn't
have enough testing of the right type
which isn't exactly trump's fault is it
how could you be ready to test something
that didn't exist yet i don't know how
that
would even work and i would point out
that if we didn't have the ability to
rapidly ramp up
new kinds of tests that we also didn't
have that during the obama
administration
so wouldn't they be identical obama
didn't have an ability to rapidly ramp
up for a test
for a coronavirus that didn't yet exist
trump also
didn't have the ability to quickly ramp
up to test
for a coronavirus that didn't exist how
are they different
all right so that i think he's just
uninformed
but maybe i'm the one here's another one
um he didn't have enough ppe and
ventilators
right but wouldn't it be true that we
didn't have any in the warehouse
from obama either did obama have any
was there any other country that had
stockpiled enough ppe
and ventilators i think the answer is no
correct me if i'm wrong but i think
every single country in the world
didn't didn't prepare in the way that we
ultimately wish we had of
with you know the ppe etc so i don't
think he was any different than any
other leader was he
unprepared some say he should use the
war powers
act sooner but what exactly would that
have gotten us
because there's no evidence that shows
that that would have therefore
done what i don't know we nobody died
for a lack of ppe
therefore the way we did it worked
nobody
nobody imagines that the war power act
could have created enough testing fast
enough
i don't think does anybody think that
i didn't see fouchy and berks
recommending that
there's the argument that trump
disbanded some
uh whatever it was some epidemiology
group or
pandemic group in the government i think
that it's
true that they were disbanded but i
think it's fake news that it made any
difference because my understanding is
those functions just
were distributed to existing departments
so it wasn't a real change it was a sort
of a change on paper
wasn't a change in function so probably
didn't make any difference
what about the the you know you should
have shut down more aggressively
well that ignores the fact that the
economy is the other part of the
equation
nobody really knows what was the right
amount
to shut down do they i don't think
anybody knows that
because you would have to wait for the
economy to play out over
years to find out if more people died
from the shutdown
and the economic disruption then died
from
the coronavirus so that's sort of an
unknown all right
uh let's talk about black lives matter
and all that
uh jack posabic on twitter yesterday
was tweeting that and actually showed
the minnesota police
training manual specifically shows
using your knee on a suspect's head
exactly the way
chauvin wasn't put his knee on george
floyd's
neck and or head in other words the
minnesota
police training has an actual photo of
how to do it
and he's doing it exactly the way the
george floyd thing went down
and so i tell you again there's just no
way they're going to get convicted of
murder
with the fentanyl in george floyd
and the fact that they asked them if he
i mean consider this
they asked him two or three times if he
was on anything
and he said no each time if he had said
yes
any one of those times they would have
been alerted
to treat him as more of a medical
problem and less as a resisting arrest
so maybe george floyd could have said
yes i have something in me and that
might be a factor
so a lot of mistakes were made
cheryl atkinson you all know a
writer on political stuff and
she noticed some friend of hers was
automatically unfollowed from her
account
and i saw her tweet on that and i
tweeted to ask other people if they had
had the same experience on her account
what do you think we found yes of course
lots and lots of people thought they had
been following her
but now they're not and they had to
re-follow
now what are we supposed to do with the
fact
that it's so blatantly obvious that the
social media algorithm
or at least who is following who is
clearly being manipulated
if it couldn't be more obvious
it's it's public we can all check it
ourselves
you can have massive confirmation
because you've seen it on my account
you've seen it on richard grinnell's
account you've seen it on matt gates
account
you've seen it on sheryl atkinson's
account now i still don't know if it's
happening to
any liberals but i haven't heard of any
so we certainly have
uh election interference in the context
of twitter
but no action shouldn't there be
something
happening such as twitter being
regulated
or some kind of investigation
why is why is the fbi not
already in twitter like
i don't understand and this is an honest
question
i don't understand why
i don't i don't understand why literally
twitter hasn't been taken over by the
fbi at this point
they should actually be on the floor of
twitter
trying to figure out why this is
happening
is there some law that says that that
they don't
that there's no reason that there's any
law broken
i know given the context of election
interference
i would think that the fbi would be all
over twitter but i don't understand
what's going on there speaking if i
don't understand that was the main line
that
that joe biden used when he made the
mistake of taking questions in public
he kept saying i don't understand why
this president i
i just don't understand i i i'm confused
i just don't understand
now let me tell you if you're being
blamed or at least accused of having
some kind of mental slowdown
you don't want to get in public and
repeat the phrase i don't understand
over and over again it's a really bad
look
it's bad enough when i do it but most
people are not accusing me of
dementia all right so here's a here's an
awkward question how do you tell
somebody
that their strategy for success
is completely wrong in other words
they've developed a strategy that
guarantees failure
but they think it's a strategy for
success how do you tell them
that it's all wrong here what i'm
talking about here
is black lives matter let me i made a
list
of all the things that they're doing
wrong strategically
that no one would argue with okay so
this is specifically a list
that i believe something close to a
hundred percent of people who understand
management leadership
success and anybody who has any
expertise and how to guess stuff done
i believe would agree with me that these
are strategy mistakes
all right here's the list selling past
the close
have i ever talked about that is when
you've already closed the sale
the the buyer has agreed to buy you've
agreed to sell
now all you have to do is take their
money the biggest strategic mistake you
could make if you're the seller
is to keep talking because anything you
say
at that point can't make you the sale
because you already have the sale
but it could lose you the sale and
that's what happened with the george
floyd thing
the moment the country saw the video of
george floyd
the sale had been made oh my goodness
we have to fix this every white person
every black person every republican
every democrat complete sale
sale has been made what happened
they kept selling they kept protesting
until there was danger
cities were destroyed now wouldn't you
say that the
george floyd initial reactions
which could have been one of the best
things that ever happened in this
country
it was a gift in a sense a tragedy of
course
but it was a gift to the country you
know
almost like you know george floyd died
for our sins kind of thing
there was almost a jesus-like i know
that's offensive but
just follow the analogy his death
could have been in in sort of an
analogous way that jesus's death
could have been a positive
in the christian religion it is his
death
as tragic as it was could have been a
positive because we all were on the same
side but it turned into a gigantic
negative
people are fleeing the cities it's the
worst situation
so that's the first mistake selling past
the close
here's the next one putting the least
capable people in charge
what what expert would say let's scour
the earth
and find the least capable leaders and
we'll put them in charge
i'm pretty sure that's what's happening
with black lives matter because of
all the other mistakes of leadership
that all that i'll mention
so clearly the worst people are in
charge nobody would make that mistake if
they knew how to do anything
how about this seeing the world as a
zero-sum
situation meaning i can't win unless you
lose
versus an abundance situation which is
i'm glad you have yours now i'll work on
getting mine hey look we can both have
as much as we want if we all do
the same if we all do the right stuff we
all get benefits
i don't know that there's any successful
anything
that has ever started with the zero sum
i can't win unless you lose motivation
in the long run that always fails
always and that's what you're seeing
with black lives matter
nothing about let's build something
together it's all about
how can you give me something zero sum
how about uh canonizing your criminals
how about the idea of making your heroes
the people who are literally criminals
now you could have i think you can hold
both thoughts
simultaneously you can certainly hold
the thought
that somebody should not be shot by the
police because of some past
criminal behavior if it wasn't part of
the actual incident
we all agree with that there's no
argument with that you don't get a shot
today for something you did you know
a year ago nobody wants to live in that
world
but is it a good strategy
to hold up your criminals as your heroes
no martin luther king
was the example of doing it right
holding up as your hero
somebody who had the right set of values
that was a good idea
holding up the people who have been
killed by police that have
records very bad idea
nobody has ever made a good outcome out
of making heroes
and the people who they should not now
the weird thing about
this is the whole controversy about
let's say confederate statues the whole
point of that
is you don't want to hold up as role
models people who have a sketchy past
and there's nothing could be sketchier
than being a past
slave owner so if you know the concept
of getting rid of confederate statues
because it sends a bad message as a role
model
why are we why are we making role models
out of slave owners that makes no
sense but how about extending that to
your own
your own population how about bringing
that forward into
current times how about making heroes
out of
thomas sowell or anybody who's got a
positive view of
of abundance or strategy
so you got that problem how about
always voting for the same political
party has
anybody ever made that work always
voting for the same party reliably
is guaranteed to take away your
political power
it's guaranteed and what are they doing
this year
they're trying even harder to make that
strategy that never works
can't work has never worked for anybody
they're doubling down
on a strategy they know can't work
because it takes away their own power
if you always vote for the same side how
about the idea of
never taking personal responsibility
yes the police should be better trained
have more options
we should look into every possibility
for better
police service to the community to keep
us safer etcetera
nobody argues with that it's a hundred
percent agreed
that every anything can be done better
especially that
but does that take away your
responsibility to teach your kids
how not to resist arrest
if you can't even have the conversation
about
you know maybe we should resist arrest a
little bit
you know a little bit better if you
can't even discuss it
you have a failing strategy because
nobody
ever succeeded by saying all the
problems were with somebody else
it's just not a strategy that's ever
worked for anybody
ever in the long run how about this
not asking to do small tests
do you know what works almost every time
well if you don't know exactly what to
do to make something better
you say hey if we can't agree what to do
can we at least agree to test some
things and see if those work
if you're not suggesting let's do some
trials and some tests
you don't have a strategy that can work
you don't
you don't don't even pretend you're
doing something useful if you're not
talking about
how to create a small test it's the only
way you can improve
if people don't automatically agree on
what's the right thing to do
how about this about turning it into a
racial problem instead of just figuring
out how you can fix it
how could they ever work to turn it into
a hate problem
instead of a what do you do about a
problem
because again they're selling past the
clothes
if you're talking about how it's racist
or not racist you're already in the
wrong conversation
because all the people you're calling
racist have already said
um i think we agree with you that we can
do this better
why are you still talking you're just
making it worse
bad strategy all right how about uh
focusing on your smallest problem
instead of your biggest problem
has anyone ever made that work let's
let's
make a list of all our priorities and
we'll spend all of our time on the
lowest one what's the lowest priority
police mistreatment of the minority
community
is it real it seems like it it seems
like there's definitely a
disproportionate thing should it be
worked on
absolutely should we put you know
a lot of attention on it sure but should
you ignore
the biggest problem which is obviously
the school system
is not serving a lot of communities and
therefore they get off to the wrong
start
and of course you'll have more crime if
you have more crime you have more
police action just everything falls
apart from that one
thing and that's of course caused by the
teachers unions
are rejecting
rejecting competition in the schools so
nobody ever made working on your
smallest problem successful
how about this one violence
whoever you know is there a long history
of minor violence working there's
there's a long history of major
violence working the civil war
i mean you could say that worked in a
sense about the american revolution that
was violence
that worked but but what case has
violence worked
in individual cases like where i'll just
shoot this guy or i'll kill this person
when has that worked that just feels
like the worst strategy in the world
how about ignoring the concept of
reciprocity
it's like the white person superpower
that people will do things for you for
nothing
and then maybe someday it'll come back
it's very similar to the
the idea of abundance versus a zero-sum
world
but the idea of reciprocity works every
time
what are the black lives matter people
doing
opposite they're asking somebody else to
give them stuff
they have their arguments but that's the
opposite
of any strategy anybody's ever made work
reciprocity works i do something for you
and something will come back to me
forcing you to give me stuff with no end
in sight because i could never get
enough to
to be equal to you that's never worked
i mean it might have some temporary gain
but in the long term it's a terrible
strategy
how about uh
developing systems that ignore human
motivation
such as socialism and marxism they've
never worked
not in their pure form you can have a
little socialism on top of capitalism
but they've never worked in their pure
form anywhere
because they ignore human motivation
that's bad strategy
how about the fact that black lives
matter they have leaders
but they don't seem to be present in
other words
i i couldn't even give you the name of
the head of black lives matter or the
three of them
or were they just founders but now
they're not running things
is it a local organization i don't even
know so if you can't identify the
leaders
there's nobody to negotiate with there's
nobody to negotiate for you
there's nobody to get you what you want
they don't have a structure
which would allow them to get anything
because there's nobody to talk to and
the demands are all over the place
until you have a leader who can solidify
demands
you don't have anything how about
ignoring you know free markets in school
choice how about believing the news
that's a bad strategy a lot of the black
lives matter stuff
comes from believing the news that
there's some kind of
epidemic of black people being hunted
and shot by police
if you believe the news then you believe
that's a problem and you orient yourself
to fixing that problem if you didn't
believe the news
in other words you understood that their
business model causes
them to make things look worse than they
are
because that gets some clicks if you
understood that
it would be a better strategy to look at
the data
et cetera all right the the obvious
outcome of doing
literally everything wrong is
segregation
and you're seeing that but we're not
calling it that yet
when when you see these news stories
about all the rich people who are moving
out of new york city
what is your brain translating that into
maybe you have to be a certain age for
this to happen
this isn't exactly about rich people
moving to where it's safe
this is a lot about rich white people
moving away from black people
can we be honest you know if you if you
ask them privately
hey um you know why are you getting out
of new york city they'd probably give
you
you know let's say politically correct
sounding answers
they'd say well there's too much crime
and you know it's unsafe
blah blah blah but in their little
prejudiced
you know racist minds these are people
who were the most
let's say politically allied with the
black world
four months ago so four months ago
the very people who were probably
packing up and leaving new york city
would be the greatest advocates for the
black community
yeah they would be you know elite
democrats very reliably
pro-black community as i am i would
consider myself
very pro-black
in the sense that if you can help the
black community everybody's better off
so i buy into that completely
um but now now that they're moving out
of the city that they love
i feel like you've converted them into
racists
and that privately they're thinking uh
that they're just getting away from
black people don't you don't you think
that that's probably true
i'm not saying that's good or bad i'm
not endorsing that
i'm not saying they should think that
nothing like that i'm just saying
predictably this is making everything
worse
somebody says it's mind reading it's not
mind reading
if you present it as speculation
if you present it as fact as mind
reading if i said
that's what they're thinking that would
be
mind reading if i say what would you be
thinking in that case or
what what do you imagine people are
thinking what's what's the likely thing
that some number of them are thinking
then that's just speculating
which is fair all right um
peter navarro tweeted about a new
hydroxychloroquine study
that's a retrospective meaning that it's
not a gold standard study but rather
they looked at
the experience of whether people got
better or not
and it showed that with this uh these
older patients
the ones who are most at risk there was
another
retrospective study that found that the
people who got the hydroxychloroquine
and azithromycin
did better had better outcomes so
i tweeted uh why is it that 95
of the retrospective tests which are
admittedly not as good as
gold standard you know randomized
control tests why is it that even though
they're not
great kinds of studies why is it that 95
of them all lean in the same direction
is it because there's the same
analytical mistake
every time and uh andres
uh backhouse who is my my go-to person
for
uh understanding data and how to how to
analyze data
so he's the most rational person that i
i've seen yet on in on twitter in
general
in terms of just picking out what's
logical and what isn't
and he makes he makes this observation
that made me slap myself in the head and
go okay yeah that's a pretty good point
and it goes like this
if you don't have a randomized control
study
then the doctors are deciding who gets
hydroxychloroquine and who doesn't
given that there is a suggestion that
there could be more of a side effect
problem if somebody is close to death
who do you think the doctors give the
hydroxychloroquine to
yeah they don't give it to the people
who are the sickest
because the assumption is that the side
effects might push them over the edge
so there's a very good reason to believe
that the doctors have self-selected
to give it to people who have less of an
illness
and are less at risk and therefore when
you look at the results at the end it's
like oh
all the people who got
hydroxychloroquine on average
they did better but it could be just a
selection bias
that the only people who got it in the
first place were people who didn't look
like they were going to die
five minutes after getting
hydroxychloroquine
if they had some side effects which we
don't imagine the side effects are bad
now i don't think that
applies to any early
might not apply to you know getting it
early versus getting it later in the
disease
but there still could be a selection
bias there's still good
so be aware of the selection bias and
we i'm still going to be at 30 odds the
hydroxychloroquine
in the end we'll find out was a good
thing and we didn't use it as much
all right here's a question oh uh
william barr
is indicating that we are certain
meaning the government is certain that
outside agitators are coming in for
these protests
to cause trouble we we don't have a lot
of detail on that
but bill barr says we have plenty of
evidence
that that's happening um
i have a question and i think there were
like three new police shooting stories
on cnn just alone this morning
one of them is there's something called
a spit bag
if somebody's spitting on you the police
will put a bag over your head
they put a bag over a guy's head because
he was had mental illness or something
he was spitting on him
and then he died like a week later and
they're being blamed for
some asphyxiation related complications
that lasted a week i don't know maybe
but here's what here's my take on this
we
we have a zombie apocalypse that we
think is a police problem
the zombie apocalypse is that people who
are on drugs or have mental illness
don't know how to not resist arrest
they are not in their right minds if the
police are shooting people who are on
drugs
or have mental illness and that those
are the ones who are doing the most
resisting arrest that's a problem that
needs to be
solved and we definitely need some more
non-lethal
means of doing that somebody sent me a
uh on twitter
a video of this bolo rope
i guess they shoot it out of some kind
of special gun and it just wraps around
your legs
almost instantly and i thought to myself
okay the bolo gun that sort of
you know captures somebody by the legs
that's good
but in a lot of these cases i don't
think they would have had a chance to
use it because it seems like
you know people grab a gun that you
didn't know they had or they reach in
their pocket or
there's it seems like i'm not sure the
timing would be right
to use that bolo rope and and i can't
imagine
that you would use it if somebody's
running toward you with a weapon
you're not going to want to try the bolo
rope first
you're probably going to want to shoot
so
treating it like it's a crime problem
entirely is probably a problem
it's it's more of a zombie apocalypse
a let's see a new study out of australia
suggests that
venom from honeybees and bumblebees
can totally kill breast cancer
without injuring the cells around them
now this is like a billion other studies
that i've seen
in the past that don't end up working
out
but it's always good to hear these
things um
it seems painful to have all those bees
stinging you and your your breasts but
maybe they have some other way of
administering it just joking of course
they do
uh sarah sanders has a new book out and
one of the anecdotes is funny apparently
kim jong-un winked at her on
when they when they visited with him and
uh
trump later joked to sarah sanders that
she might have to leave
leave her family and you know go live
with kim jong-un to quote
take one for the team
which is pretty funny
[Laughter]
governor andrew cuomo who i was
surprised to find out is younger than me
i feel like he looks older but i think
that's just because i think i
i fooled myself into thinking i look
younger
but he after president trump was uh
noodling on the idea of with
withholding federal funds from cities
that are
just not taking care of the chaos
cuomo didn't like that and he said that
quote talking about trump he can't have
enough bodyguards to walk through new
york city cuomo said
forget bodyguards he better have an army
if he thinks he's going to walk down the
streets in new york
now he went on to explain that he meant
the
the president is unwelcome in new york
but
is that the way you say somebody's
unwelcome
you literally talk about killing him
i've never seen democrats go completely
so obviously into let's murder the
president
it's the most irresponsible thing i've
ever seen from a governor
and i would think you should be removed
from office in a
you know an impeachment governor cuomo
should
just for saying that that is so bad
and the impact it has on people who will
literally now think oh
i guess we can attack trump supporters
so andrew cuomo uh i haven't i haven't
warned you all about swearing so i'll
hold back
for now but andrew cuomo you just made
my life more dangerous you made the
chance of me getting attacked
a little bit higher that's what the
governor of new york just did
now i get that he doesn't like what
trump is doing
but he did just make violence more
acceptable
and i don't know what would be more
impeachable than that
if that's not the most impeachable thing
in the world i don't know what is
uh all right um
so
uh the apparently the russians we have
some information
that the russians are trying to spread
misinformation about joe biden's health
now and apparently uh
cnn is using this the fact that
the department of homeland security they
quote
withheld an intelligence bulletin
bulletin
warning of a russian plot to spread
misinformation about joe biden's health
which they note mirrors the president's
own attacks
now let me ask you this
cnn has said some dumb things before but
if you're alive and you're in the united
states and you're following politics
or even if you're not were you unaware
that president trump and all republicans
are saying that joe biden has some kind
of mental decline did you need to wait
and hear that from putin is there
anybody in the united states
who has somehow missed an avalanche of
non-stop news
about joe biden's mental capacity
they've missed all of that
you know wall-to-wall coverage of it it
seems like every day
but they did see something that the
russians did that suggested the same
thing
and it was that russian suggestion that
flipped them it's like oh oh i
had noticed that but i saw this meme on
facebook
that looks like it was made by a sixth
grader in russia
oh now i'm convinced now i think joe
biden has a mental problem
i don't think this is quite the problem
that cnn thinks it is
barr said when he was talking to wolf
blitzer in an interview
he said quote this is playing with fire
he was talking about mail and ballots
and
how they're not dependable so we're a
very closely divided country here
uh and so it's playing with fire and
and he said it's just logical that votes
could be faked now here's the really fun
part
the president apparently in his speech i
guess in pennsylvania
where the the polls by the way are
showing is pretty tight
the president suggested that if
everybody is so sure
there's nobody else in the world who
would have done this
because it's either brilliant or
reckless and even i can't decide which
one it is
so president trump has suggested that if
everybody is so
sure that mail-in votes are secure
that why don't you try to vote twice and
see what happens
try to vote once in person and once with
the mail in
and see if in fact the system flags it
and gives you only one vote now
that's either brilliant or
is really really reckless it's one of
those two things maybe it's both
i don't know but when you hear that and
you hear the president say
well just try it do you think that the
government records in every state
are good enough that they will be able
to determine
in a timely fashion that you voted twice
now what makes this reckless is that
it's a federal offense
right but i can't imagine you would be
necessarily
convicted you know if if your
grandmother votes twice
and the system allows it when we had
been told that the system
wouldn't allow it see here's the cool
part
that makes this maybe genius could you
be convicted
of voting twice once at a once at a
voting booth
but also once separately you dropped
your ballot in the mail
if you had been told that there's no
scenario in which your vote would be
counted twice
did he hear that you have been told
non-stop
by your respected media that there's no
chance that voting twice would work
so what if you tried it the president
suggests
what if you tried it could you go to
jail
for a crime that you've been told by
your own government
and the entire media can't happen
in other words you would have a complete
expectation
that you did not vote twice
even if you went through the steps of
voting twice you would have the
expectation
reasonable completely reasonable you've
been told by cnn and others
that they got this locked down there's
there's no way that fraud happens
the it's all good
you would have you would be able to say
it is my belief
that i've only voted once because every
expert told me
that only one of them would count i just
wanted to make sure
that my vote didn't get lost in the mail
so i voted in person
i also voted by the mail just to make
sure one of them got through
obviously your database will will
immediately
detect it toss one out
no harm right it's gonna be a messy
situation
all right so it might be terrible that
the president said that but on the other
hand
once he did say it you you can really
see the problem in a way you couldn't
see before
i would say that that provocative way of
putting it
really solidifies in your head that
you've been lied to
because there's nobody in the world who
is dumb enough
to think that all the states have good
records and that the timing would work
that they could line up your mail vote
with your in-person vote
there's nobody who thinks your
government is that efficient
and when the president puts that out
there it's really hard to argue that
this is going to be a
credible outcome all right
the the father of jacob blake the
the person who has killed with seven
bullets and the police stop
they cause a lot of the riots uh
apparently he is uh
anti-semitic now
here's my take on that i'm not jewish
so i'm going to rely on people who are
to tell me whether this this guy is
being anti-semitic
because i have a rule that i don't get
offended on behalf of other people
i might get offended on behalf of myself
i don't know if it's ever happened i
don't really get offended by much
but i'm not going to get offended on
behalf of other people
they have to tell me they're offended
and then i'll deal with that
but you know i can't judge it myself so
credible people have said they've looked
at
jacob blake seniors social media stuff
and it's important because there's some
thought that joe biden
will go meet with him and he said some
things about
about jews that if you looked at it you
would say to yourself
okay i can see why people are
uncomfortable with this but again
i'm going to let other people decide
what's wrong and what's offensive in
that mode
but certainly you could look at it and
say okay i see what they're talking
about
however
i happen to read through jacob blake
seniors
posts and comments and one of them
really stuck
out and you know if you could pick out
the one good thing
that's coming out of all this badness i
mean there's a lot of badness coming out
of all this
protest situation but at the same time
i feel like i've learned things that
would make me
feel a little more empathetic or more
understanding
and oddly enough jacob blake senior
wha whatever his other flaws might be
uh laid down a little red pill on me
that i'd never heard before
i said well i take that back i think i
sort of heard it
but it didn't really register and i went
like this and
this is in a anti-semitic context
from jacob blake senior but he points
out that everybody's aware i'm
paraphrasing here but he points out that
everybody's aware of the holocaust
you would agree right everybody's aware
of the holocaust and any informed adult
would even know the number six
million-ish
you know dead in the holocaust and then
jacob blake senior asks
but why don't you know about king
leopold
of the belgian king and the congo
and when he said when i read that i said
who
is he talking about who's this king
leopold
belgium king why do i care about him
and what did he do in the congo so i
checked it out
did a little google search did you know
that king leopold the belgian king in
the
late 1800s killed 10 to 15 million
black people 10 to 15 million
in the congo he basically took over the
congo
turned everybody into slave labor and
between directly killing people
and harsh conditions etc
10 to 15 million people died now
did you know that did you know that
now the way jacob lake senior puts it
he's comparing it to the holocaust and
then it becomes anti-semitic because of
the context
but does he have a good point
not to diminish the holocaust of course
but rather to say why didn't you learn
this in school
i mean seriously somebody says shame on
you scott
you could put more of a reason on that
you get blocked for saying shame on you
scott
without a reason if you would be
included any reason
you would not be getting getting blocked
even if i disagreed with the reason
that's my rule somebody says no agenda
had it on a month ago
yeah and you know if there's one thing
you can do in this situation
you should spend at least a hot minute
trying to put yourself in the head of
your fellow citizens
who are greatly distressed and just try
to understand
like what would it feel like to live in
a country
that had statues of people who were
slave owners
like what would that feel like would you
like it
i wouldn't like it so that's why i agree
that the confederate statues of the ones
who supported slavery anyway you should
at least put in be put in context if
nothing else
and should we not teach more about this
king leopold so that that's not general
knowledge
because i feel like that is a little bit
you know it fits right into the do black
lives matter
if we're not if that's not common
knowledge that king leopold killed 10 to
15 million black people
i feel like that's something we should
know about right
if you're being if you're being fair you
should know about that
uh so we won't we will not we will not
uh excuse jacob blake senior of any
other opinions which you may think
are offensive they do at least
feel that way to me to my uncritical eye
all right
uh cnn's van jones is urging democrats
to only protest during the daytime
because the nighttime stuff is where all
the bad stuff happens and it's just
gonna
help trump get reelected he is correct
that is exactly what's gonna happen
are you having trouble figuring out what
any of the
political polls mean
uh it's really hard to figure out
if trump is ahead or behind you can't
even really tell
because the the idea of the i guess
kellyanne conway called them the
undercover
what you call them the undercover trump
supporters
because there's a lot of data that says
people don't want to
give their opinion to anybody including
a pollster
so it seems to me that trump within four
percent
is a trump landslide it feels like that
is that the number what number would you
put on it
trump within two percent is a definite
victory
trump within four percent of let's say
the average of the polls as opposed to
the ones that tend to be accurate
rasmussen tends to be accurate and a few
others
but if you just took the average and it
came out to about four percent advantage
for biden i feel like he loses
with a four percent advantage because of
the
hidden vote situation
all right yeah joe haydn joe hiden by
i think i talked about everything i want
to talk about
i think i did yeah the stalin and mao
killed millions but they killed mostly
people like themselves which feels up
feels different
somebody says the betting odds are now
in trump's favor did it did it crossover
um oh somebody says how many armenians
killed
good question yeah the armenian
genocide is so-called um i don't know
that actually i don't know the
the alleged death count
on that but yeah that's why don't we
know about all the
all the holocausts
uh somebody says proud boys are going to
portland at the end of september
that's a long ways away end of september
do you think we'll still be doing the
protests
probably somebody says
seven percent seven percent would be
tough
uh somebody says why does van jones not
support
trump well you can't ask
too many you can't ask a lifelong
democrat
to support a republican it's just not
realistic
all right that's all i got for now
and i will talk to you a bit later i
believe
you should all be looking for an adam
townsend
he's going to be doing a live stream
with mark schneider
i think that's today so look for that
i'll tweet about it if
i get a chance and i will talk to you
later
