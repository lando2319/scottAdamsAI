we've got something going come on
technology
technology come on there we
go it's all working
boom good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of human civilization
it's called coffee with Scott ads and
you've never had a better day but if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny brains all you
need for that
is a cuper mug glass a tanker chel St a
canteen J or flask or Fel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the UN the
unparalleled pleasure the the dopamine
of the
day shut up
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go all right I have to come clean uh my
local local subscribers already know
this but my coffee maker is
broken uh and my other coffee maker is
broken so my Main coffee maker and my
backup coffee maker are neither of them
are working so this was not actual
coffee and it just ruins the whole
experience let me tell
you anyway but enough about that happy
St Patrick's Day I'm a little bit Irish
a little bit I'm more Irish today
because it's St Patrick's Day but a
little bit
Irish speaking of other countries uh
there's a law French lawmaker who is
calling for the return of the Statue of
Liberty because I guess he doesn't like
Trump so that's
normal um and I don't think we should
return the Statue of Liberty what do you
think I don't think we should but I've
got an idea of just rotating at
180Â° and removing the torch and
replacing it with the
finger so that the statue is just giving
the finger to France okay that would be
funny um but I but I do think the
Democrats probably would agree with
getting rid of the Statue of Liberty
because have you noticed that the Statue
of Liberty has been giving
a a Nazi
salute yeah they sort of trick you by
putting the torch in the hand but that
just just makes it worse it's like it's
a Nazi salute and you want to burn
everything down with your torch I think
that should be deeply condemned and we
should remove the Statue of Liberty and
give it back to France you know after we
change the torch to a
finger well believe it or not according
to sa poost there's a study about twins
that suggests that uh it turns out
you you won't believe this this will be
hard to believe but rational thinking is
genetically linked to intelligence and
it challenges the idea that decision
making is a separate skill so in other
words they found out that you can't
teach stupid people how to be smart by
teaching them how to
think now I could have saved them a
little bit of time because I once tried
to teach my dog to read
and she just refused she she never
learned to read but uh no it is not true
that you can teach you cannot teach dumb
people to be smart by teaching them how
to think better you know
Bob I've been noticing noticing that
you're a franking but I think I
can fix that with a few
tweaks uh did you know that if you were
to look at let's say the information pro
and con you would get get a better
result really I could I should look at
the information on both sides of an
issue yes you should Bob why don't you
try that next time all right I will and
then what does Bob do does Bob look at
the information on both sides of the
issue next time because you taught Bob
how to be a better decision maker nope
Bob will forget that
advice before you turn around and walk
out the door
because Bob is not
smart it's been my my observation that
all smart people tend to think
alike
rationally it's definitely it's
definitely genetic now I will say though
I will
say that if you're starting with a smart
person you can definitely teach them
some extra tools such as how to spot
fake news that's useful right I've been
teaching most of you how to do that and
most of you do know you so you often say
to me oh that one's too on the NOS
that's one of the things I teach you oh
there's just one source and it's
Anonymous that's one of the things I
teach you uh Etc so you can teach smart
people how to be even smarter but if
you're trying to take teach a dumb
person how to think like a smart
person good luck with that could have
just asked me save a little
time here's a story that makes my heart
sing the Trump Administration is
targeting 45
universities uh over their anti-white
discrimination um Hannah Nightingale of
the post-millennials writing about this
so instead of a making decisions or
having any kind of policies that are
race related
um they're being challenged to get rid
of that stuff and the
universities are going to be in a little
trouble because one of the things that
the Trump Administration seems to be
willing to use as a tool is removing
Federal funding for um research and
grants which apparently I didn't know
this until recently is such a major
funding for a lot of the big schools
that if they lost the Federal research
and grant money they they'd be in real
financial trouble I mean it's a major
source I
guess anyway so this is especially
satisfying to me that that essentially
the Dei stuff has become illegal and
when I say become illegal it was always
illegal it's just we didn't treat it
that way until
Trump so you might remember that this is
about
right now it's about two years since I
got
cancelled does anybody remember me
getting cancelled of course you do now
the interesting thing about my
cancellation is I realized the other day
that you know my my lasting Legacy you
know the way I'll be remembered by
search engines and AI will be two things
that didn't happen so my primary
Legacy will be based on things that
didn't happen that aren't true number
one that I gave a racist rant and that's
why I got cancelled that didn't happen I
was ranting Against
Racism very specifically I was against
people who are racist and I said wow why
would I want to live with a bunch of
racists I would want to live where
they're not which is literally what
every single person in the world would
agree with why would you want to live
where you know there a bunch of racists
now of course I've never been in favor
of racism against an individual you know
not in hiring not in dating not in
Friendship not in picking teams nothing
so of course I've always been you know
Against
Racism so I've been Against Racism
against individuals but also if there's
a group that seems to be extra racist
according to data and there was Data
then I say said maybe you should not
spend time with people who are a little
more racist against you than you're
comfortable with every single person in
the world agrees with that but I got
canceled so how much pleasure do you
think I
get watching the thing I I canceled
for become
illegal a lot it's satisfying on a level
that you can barely
understand but I'll always be remembered
as the guy who made the racist rant
because the news is fake history is fake
the history books are fake and mostly
what the AI will tell you in the future
will be fake
unfortunately um the other thing I'll be
remembered for is a thing that
definitely didn't happen which is all of
my opinions about the uh pandemic being
reversed so one of the things I'm most
proud of um is that I had the best
opinions in the pandemic
of any public figure by far it wasn't
even close most people believe that my
opinions were the opposite of what they
were so people believe I was promoting
vaccines no that never happened not once
and so I'll be remembered for two
things that definitely didn't happen in
any real
world but that's you know that's the
fate of of public figures you you get
remembered for the opposite of whatever
whatever ever you were
doing anyway the big story of the day is
that uh Trump is trying to cancel the
pardons that uh that Biden made they
were made with the autopen now the
autopen is what presidents use to sign
things when they're not physically
available but you know things that
they've agreed to so it's not there's
nothing sketchy about it the way it's
been used in the past however given what
we know about Biden's Administration and
given what we know about his mental uh
Acuity at the time and given that there
were some last minute
pardons it's not clear that Biden even
knew they happened so does Trump have a
good case well um the smart thing that
Trump is doing and is consistently done
is he says well if the courts
disagree then we'll follow the court
and that's very disarming it's very non-
dictator and that's what he's doing here
so he's taking it he's taking a run at
it that doesn't mean he'll succeed so
the Supreme Court could say no autopen
counts you know there's nothing you can
do about it otherwise blah blah
blah so I've got a feeling he has no
better
than I don't know since I don't know
much about the court or how it would r
rule I'm going to say 50% chance that it
will stick but boy is this got to be
scary to the what what he calls the
unselect group the people who ran the uh
what I would consider the fake
impeachment um things or the the fake
January St six stuff and they do have
some explaining to do and there's a good
reason that they wanted their
pardons so this one's getting really
dicey getting really dicey because uh if
Trump
succeeds in undoing the pardons because
of the
autopen
um Adam schiff's probably going to
jail Liz
Cheney probably going to
jail because I do believe that the the
legal system would find the they did um
some pretty illegal things so at the
very least they would be destroyed by
the legal process which would be you
know gigantically
burdensome and my feeling about a lot of
this stuff is that and Lindsey Graham
did the best explanation on a new show
that once you look at the context of
what these same people did to Trump they
tried to destroy him politically
they tried to destroy his entire
business they tried to destroy his
family and they tried to put him in jail
for the rest of his
life they did much the same to people
who supported him they went after the
lawyers who supported him they went
after his supporters in every way that
they could
and in normal times I would say you know
maybe let the past go you know that yeah
there was some dirty tricks there but
you know let's let's not dwell on that
let's move forward let's look forward
but if you look at the totality of the
pure
evil that was aimed to him I'm 100% in
favor of his
revenge because it feels
personal uh you know I feel like I got
dragged down by the same the same bad
guys you know let
but do you think I ever would have been
cancelled if it hadn't been for the
Trump connection nope nope I don't think
I would have been and
so these are all of my enemies
too and I wouldn't mind seeing them
taken down completely just
destroyed because I do think they earned
it and I do think it would look like
justice to me like real Justice not not
the Revenge I'm you know I'm happy my
team one kind of Justice I don't want
that kind I'm not looking for the my
team one your team lost kind of Justice
nope I want the actual real kind where
if you're a for years and
years and years and you're the most evil
lying piece of shits in the world it's
time for you to get
flushed and I'm here for it so if Trump
can get away with this
that would be very good I would love it
I don't think he will I've got a feeling
the Supreme Court is going to say uh we
don't need this it's a little little too
much
trouble so maybe regardless of you know
the legality of it I still think the
Supreme Court might say you know we're
going to find a reason not to do this
because it would just be too destructive
to The Republic and they might right but
I'm still for
it um as you know lots of uh
conservatives have been swatted lately
conservative pundits um so data
Republican you all know who she is right
data Republican is a great data um
analyst which feels like too little
because she's so good that feels like
she needs her own label but anyway she
did an analysis of uh I think there are
now third or 14 people have been swatted
recently but she had a list of 10 or so
andt an analysis using AI to try to find
out what they had in
common uh and Al which would maybe help
you figure out you who was after them uh
but also to maybe predict who would be
next here are some of the things that um
that she found in common so a lot of the
people who got
swatted um engaged with Elon Musk on
X uh their real life identities were
known so they weren't pseudonyms or
anything they used their real names or
at least their real names were easy to
find like CAD
turd um they had good number of
followers usually over 50,000 but
actually most of the time over
150,000 uh there were often guests who
were employees for
Infowars uh war room or similar alt
media kind of shows on the right uh then
there's this one expressed pro-israel or
at least the anti Hamas
sentiments okay um frequently Amplified
others swatting victims in the past so
it seems like a network of people who
boosted each
other and many of them were Amplified by
based Mike
Lee and the targets were all
male the targets were all male that's
interesting um so data data Republican
said uh that her current leading theory
is that it's a terrorist campaign
targeting X and influencers connected to
Elon
Musk
so and then somebody said but what about
the fact that they might be anti-
Ukraine and data Republican this is why
she's so good she says that the anti-
Ukraine doesn't add add much signal
meaning that since most of the
conservative world is anti- Ukraine at
the moment you can't really say these
ones got swatted because they're anti-
Ukraine because sort of everybody
was um so I don't know so I guess the
theory that it's it's a anti- Elon
Musk I I would say that's a
possibility could be could be just
anti-trump um I don't know U but it
could be static terrorism which is just
making it easier to attack a certain
group of people who speak out but uh
we'll see we'll
see uh um that's a good analysis I don't
think it gives us an answer but it you
know maybe maybe it defines the things a
little bit better so we know what to
look
for and maybe it will have an effect
could have you know if if the
analysis got anywhere near the
truth it might slow it down because now
we would be looking for these signals
we'd say okay uh did you say anything
about did you interact with Elon Musk
Etc now even the interacting with Elon
Musk
thing uh to me that's not much of a
signal because musk does interact with a
whole bunch of people um and multiple
times sometimes so he's interacted with
me a number of times and uh so I don't
know he's interacted with so many people
I'm not sure that that's the signal it
looks like
Anyway president Trump says he's going
to talk to uh Putin uh
tomorrow and doesn't it seem to you like
that's way too long to wait I mean just
think about the fact that there are
people in ditches shooting at each other
and dying you around K and all around
the front lines because I assume the
fighting is just going crazy even though
they're talking peace so it's just so
weird that you'd say hey can I call you
tomorrow is there really no reason they
can talk today are are they not prepared
do do they have something more important
there are people literally just getting
torn to
pieces on the front lines for no reason
because you know it looks like things
are going to wind up so anybody who gets
killed or wounded
today that's a complete waste of
humanity so I don't I just don't know
how you you say Hey you available
tomorrow is tomorrow
good today is good like right now is
good that that's how I feel now if if we
got something done tomorrow that was
important that you know I'd be pretty
happy about it but this whole thing
about you know if you're serious about
ending The Killing tomorrow is really
too long but on the other hand you don't
want to act too eager because that might
hurt your negotiating position but
really how about today that's my take
anyway um according to the New York Post
Trump said uh we want to see if we can
bring that war to an end um he he says
maybe we can maybe we can't I think we
have a very good chance now I think he's
talking about his conversation tomorrow
that maybe they're they're far enough
along that he might be able to close a
deal that seems like a
stretch um and he said uh a lot of
work's been done over the weekend now a
lot of works been done means that
they're close to a
deal and I don't think he'd make the
call you know even though you know
there's urgency I don't think he'd make
the call tomorrow unless he felt like
there was some chance that whatever
remaining issues are you could close
on now remember how I always tell you
that you should expect at least one walk
away in a in a big negotiation there's
usually this point where one side says
all right nope nope we're done and and
they walk away and they pretend or
sometimes it's real that nope I'm done
dealing with you I cannot make a deal
now what that can do is cause the one
who got walked away on to say all right
all right I'll offer you a little bit
more but I'm not sure there'll be a walk
away on this
one and the reason is they're both too
smart
if if Trump did A Walk Away Putin would
say that's not real he'll come back if
Putin did A Walk Away Trump would say
that's not real he'll come back so I
think they both know each other well
enough that a walk away would just
look sort of
stupid because you're dealing with two
people who are way above the the line
you they both understand how everything
works right there's no dumb one and no
smart one there just two brilliant
people who know how to do this exactly
if you know how to do this which is
negotiate the hard stuff and they do
then the walkway is a little bit
unnecessary um it the walk away is sort
of what you do if you're dealing with
somebody who's just not good at
it or or somebody who's at least not
world class at it um so I'm going to
predict this would be one of those r
negotiations with no walk
away so which is a bold that's a pretty
big prediction because you you just
normally see a walkway I just don't
think there will be in this case because
the equality of the two people
negotiating well Putin said he wants an
ironclad guarantee that Ukraine will not
join
NATO now do you remember when the head
of NATO said nope there's no chance that
Ukraine
is going to be part of NATO and then you
realized okay that was after talking to
Trump so probably Trump is the one who
told NATO to say there's no way
Ukraine's going to be part of it and
then you said to yourself but wait
Trump's giving away something for
nothing like we don't have a deal yet
like why would he give that away you
know wouldn't that be the thing that you
would keep as your negotiating
card and then you say to yourself
is that really giving anything
away how could you ever give an ironclad
guarantee that nobody will ever change
their mind about Ukraine joining NATO
you can't all it would take is somebody
to say I changed my mind that's it so if
Trump and NATO say yep we guarantee it
there's no way Ukraine will ever be part
of NATO what exactly are they giving up
nothing that's literally nothing because
Putin knows they can just change their
mind and they know they could just
change their mind now they wouldn't do
it
unless probably unless situation changed
but if the situation changed you don't
think they could NATO up in about five
minutes yeah if they wanted to and they
had some strategic reason to do it yes
now I don't think they want to and I
don't think they'll have that strategic
reason but it's a weird one because the
thing that Putin wants the
most is the cheapest to give to him it
literally doesn't cost anything and and
there's and it doesn't even bind us
because if it if it would became a you
know important security
consideration yeah Ukraine would get
NATO up in five
minutes so how in the world could you
guarantee such a thing now on the other
side Putin has the same situation we'd
like him to
guarantee that if we make a deal he
won't make a move on the rest of Ukraine
at some later
date how in the world could that ever be
guaranteed it
can't so the two things that the sides
want the most important two things you
know one wants NATO and the other wants
a guarantee that there would be no
future attacks that's something that
both sides can say
okay because it's not giving away
anything there's no asset there it's
nothing you're not giving away anything
because both sides could just change
their mind tomorrow and it's not like we
can ask for
collateral right we can't say I'll tell
you what uh we we'll hold Moscow as
collateral and in case you attack we get
to keep
Moscow no there's no way you can put
collateral on it what what kind of
guarantee could you ever come up with
now I'd love to be
wrong I'd love to find out that there's
some clever way you could guarantee this
sort of thing but I don't think
so yeah so that that'll be the hard part
how in the world do you do something
that would guarantee
anything when both of them absolutely
need
guarantees I don't know it's going to be
really interesting I do think they can
get it done but only because they're
both incentivized to do it they both
want it
done
and they might trust each other at least
in the short run but long run I don't
know nothing can be guaranteed in the
long
run well let's talk about the leaders of
the
Democrats um Josh Shapiro governor of
Pennsylvania was on Bill Marshall and
Bill Mar was you know talking about him
as a potential you know future leader of
the Democrats and he said that the
people said that uh you Josh Shapiro
couldn't become the VP choice to KL
Harris because you're
Jewish and that wouldn't uh be
successful you know the way our country
is and Josh Shapiro had just the best
answer to that now it's not a complete
answer because he was talking about
being Governor but he said when he ran
for a
governor uh his first ad featured his uh
Friday night um
Shabbat where because of his Jewish Fai
every Friday he'd be gathering with
friends and family and having a
celebratory
you know very much in the Jewish
tradition kind of a dinner so instead of
hiding from it or well hiding is the
wrong word instead of downplaying his
religion and just saying stuff like ah
it doesn't matter doesn't matter he just
opened he just opened the door and said
here it is here's what we do you know I
like my religion you like your
religion let's talk now to me that was
one of the most brilliant things he
could have ever done
because here's what I know about
people people will distrust anything
they're unfamiliar
with it's just sort of a reflex so it's
not like that you that people would be
necessarily you know
anti-semitic it would just be something
different and they'd say I'm not sure I
understand that or I know it or you know
I don't know anybody who is Jewish they
might say um so I don't know sure I
trust it but he leads with it and says I
have no secrets here here's my deal here
here's how I worship I love how I
worship I love how you
worship let's let's all be
worshippers that is so disarming it's
just so disarming so to me that's
brilliant just to lead with it and say
you know I'm a good person you're a good
person we don't even need to talk about
this but if you have questions glad to
answer
um the trouble is I don't think that
would work for national
office that it's a brilliant thing for
local or Governor but as soon as you're
talking about the federal government
then it instantly turns into so how much
do you like Israel and are you going to
support Israel over the United States uh
would you treat it as an equal you know
so you get all those
questions and those uh don't have to do
with whether we like anybody's you know
choice of religion it's more about H can
we be sure you know people would have
their doubts um basically about whether
America First really meant America First
and they wouldn't know now I have no
reason to think he's anything but
America first so let me be clear about
that um but the public would probably
have their questions so yeah that might
be a problem running um for a national
office I think we need to get there you
know the same reason I thought that
electing Obama was a good step for
America regardless of how you think he
governed that's a separate question but
I felt it was healthy for us to just get
over it I think it was healthy to get
over Kennedy being
Catholic you know it's better to just go
right at it you know is I I think it was
healthy that uh Hillary Clinton was the
nominee and kle Harris was a nominee and
they got close you know even not winning
felt like hey that's the America I want
to live in where everybody gets a shot
so yeah I think it'd be good for the
country just have somebody at getting
close to office even if they didn't
win all
right
um here are some other people that the
Democrats
have um according to CNN AOC is seen as
the leader of the democratic party with
KL Harris as a close close
second and of course there's Jasmine
Crockett who's making a lot of lot of
noise on
TV and uh Bernie Sanders uh R's uh prus
was talking about how lame the Democrat
leadership is he says that only AOC and
Bernie Sanders can get a crowd of 20
people to show up
now that's an exaggeration but not a big
one not a big one it's an excellent
point but but just think about just
think about the people who are the
leaders from Chuck Schumer to AOC KL
Harris uh Tim Walls Jasmine
Crockett Bernie
Sanders uh Nancy
Pelosi um why can I never remember the
minority leader uh
what's his
name what's the minority Leader's
name why can't remember them anyway
so yeah they have a real problem but it
seems to me that they've also painted
themselves in a corner hakeim hakeim
Jeff thank
you and hakee Jeff has an unfortunate
Vibe
problem um I'm sure he's very smart or
he wouldn't be in his position but
there's just something about his
Persona that just reeks of I don't trust
you it's it's the darnest thing you'd
have to try pretty hard to look
untrustworthy every single time you
talked yeah he he's got that uh movie
character look that says okay you could
play a bad guy in this movie and I don't
know what I don't know I don't know how
to fix that that doesn't seem fixable by
just smiling more so they don't really
have much going on I think I think
they're going to have to pick again I
think they'll have to pick a woman
because the Democrats are very woman
focused and I think the woman will have
to be a woman of color so that says AOC
K Harris Jasmine
Crockett and I don't think any of them
can win against any solid Republican
candidate so how in the world how in the
world will they ever go back in
power anyway speaking of Jasmine
Crockett she was talking about Trump
using that uh what I like to call the
Adams era law now this is referring to
President John Adams and uh you you know
the story that Trump used the alien
enemies act from
1798 which uh would allow the president
to detain or Deport
non-citizens from an enemy country
during war and I think he set the he set
the stage for that by declaring that uh
these trenda or waga gang members were
terrorists so suddenly if they're
terrorists and they're coming from
another country you know you're you're
pretty close to saying that you're at
war with them and uh that the president
can kick him out well the airplanes were
in the air to deport these very people
um there was a judge of course it's
going to be an Obama appointee Lefty
judge that they found uh question the
use of the law in this particular
context and said that those planes need
to turn around even if they're already
in the air but apparently and it's being
credited to Steven Miller uh they had
rushed the the flights so that by the
time the judge ruled the flights were
already in international
waters and the counterargument is going
to be hey that ruling doesn't apply
because these these uh these people are
not even in the United States anymore
they're in international waters and then
they landed and uh sure enough El
Salvador um processed them and put them
in the El Salvador prisons
so we'll see if that gets uh if that
gets reversed if it does get reversed
then people like Jasmine Crockett who
are arguing against it uh once
again are going to be on the ridiculous
side now I realize that you know
Jasmine's argument has some Nuance to it
she's not saying I like you know evil
gang members she's saying if the
president is allowed to use this rule in
that way you know will be expanded and
he'll do bad things in the
future but most of the you notice that a
lot of the uh complaints about Trump are
things that they imagine he would do in
the
future which is the weirdest kind of
complaint because you could say that
about everybody all the time it's like
well you know I like this candidate but
I worry that they'll round everybody up
and murder them in the future is there
any evidence that they want to do that
no no but based on the fake news I've
been reading it sounds like exactly the
sort of thing they do in the
future all right
um anyway so Trump wants to deport gang
members any way he can and the Democrat
argument about it is according to
Jasmine Crockett the argument against
getting rid of these dangerous gang
members any way we can is blah blah use
this should use a scalpel blah blah
concept blah blah vague fear of the
future they really have
nothing and I love the the thing that
Trump does so so well is communicating
in a relatable
way these are terrible people we're
going to do whatever we can to get them
out of our country got it got it
uh counterargument well this is a law
that might be used outside of its
context and you know I worry that he's
using a a hatchet instead of a scalpel
and what if he did bad things in the
future and then you hear that you go
none none of that stuck to my brain
could you say it
again oh well the law 1798 or out of
context and you know the legal process
es and the
scalpel what and then Trump says these
are terrible murderous people we're
going to get rid of them anyway we can
got it got
it well limbs of Tik Tock uh and others
were showing that uh according to the
the border patrol the amount of Sentinel
seas that the US Mexico border is uh
down 40% since January it's lowest level
since 20 21 now that would suggest that
closing the
Border also has already greatly reduced
the flow of
fentanyl
right well probably
not um it might be that the fentol is
reduced but not because the Border got
um better controlled because if you
didn't know this the fentanyl is not
coming across in the pockets of the
individuals who are walking across the
Border in places we didn't want them to
walk across the border that's not how it
gets in that would be the worst way to
do it it turns out that almost all of it
goes in automobiles that are legally
entering the
country so it's not like there's a lot
of illegal entries that also had
fentanyl that almost doesn't exist what
it is is that we can only check maybe
20% of the traffic
and because it's so cheap to make
fentanyl you wouldn't really care if 20%
of it got caught as long as 80% didn't
so since I don't think there's been any
real change in how the traffic the legal
traffic back and forth that goes through
legal checkpoints I don't think there's
been a change there so one of the
changes there could be is a a lot of
expense to bring in more um some kind of
scale SC devices that they can use on
automobiles but even then it would slow
down traffic to the point where I'm not
sure you could really do it because it
would just stop you know all border
traffic so here's what I think I don't
think that the decrease in illegal
entries is really correlated with the
decrease in fentanyl but if fentanyl is
actually weigh down and it might be you
know they only report what they caught
not what not what got through so we
don't know it's down we just know that
what we caught is way down it could be
that there's some other pressure on the
fentanyl dealers I assume there is so it
could be that the labs are you know
being disrupted and they have to
relocate because they're worried about
our Reaper drones getting ready to set
them on fire so it could be just the
operation is completely skedaddling to
try to hide their their labs and and
it's going to take a couple months
before they can crank up it maybe just
that could be that there's enough
pressure on China
finally that uh the fewer precursors are
making it to Mexico to be turned into
fenel maybe I think that's the least
likely but if I had to guess probably
there's enough uh credible military
threat that the labs are just shutting
down and relocating so temporarily they
can't make much
product just a guess but I don't think
it's because the there a fewer illegal
Crossings I just don't think they're
correlated according to the telegraph
more eggs and fenel are being seized in
the
Border more eggs than fenel it turns out
that eggs are really cheap South of the
Border so a whole bunch of people
thought huh why don't I just buy eggs in
Mexico you know get a bunch of extra and
then go go north and sell them for you
know twice as much as I bought them and
so a lot of people are doing that so uh
there's some possibility that the
cartels are getting out of the Sentinel
business and moving into
eggs no just kidding they wouldn't do
that
but the the egg smuggling business has
taken
a has taken over for fenel
uh Laura lummer has another scoop uh
this time that she found that Hunter
Biden apparently has been living in
South Africa in a
hotel uh she calls it a five-star
Oceanside Villa and I guess he's got
full Secret Service
protection which seems very expensive
seems very expensive to have a secret
service in another country sort of
permanently
semi-permanently uh especially at a
seaside resort kind of place so that's
weird but as Laura Lum points out um he
he's claimed that he has no money so
he's did a signed declaration in court
that he's poor but yet he's living like
a person who does have money so the
question would be where's the money
coming from or did you lie when he said
he didn't have any maybe he just sells
one painting a week it's all he needs to
support his lifestyle don't know but uh
yeah hunters in South Africa when was
the last time you heard a story about
South Africa that wasn't about something
bad because there's another South Africa
story about apparently South Africa has
some kind of a research facility in uh
Antarctica and and uh let's see let me
skip ahead to
that yeah I'll do that in order we'll
get to that there's a story about a
research facility anyway
um according to Breitbart News there's a
representative uh Brandon enill or
onil Brandon Gil um yeah Brandon Gil and
he wants to see if uh if he can get the
Congress to prohibit foreign country
from buying real estate in America if
that country doesn't allow Americans to
buy real estate in their country now
China would be obviously the main target
of this um because China buys a lot of
property in the
US and farmland especially so what do
you think about
that to me that seems like an easy one
yeah if we can't buy land in China why
do we let China buy land in the United
States
I mean that that just seems basic you
know it it has to be at least
reciprocal so yeah I'd be in favor of
that um it would be expensive it would
probably lower our it would probably
lower property costs which would be good
for people buying
stuff meanwhile uh the EPA Chief Lee
zeldon he's saying that uh Trump's
deregulation push and he's big part of
it um I said on Fox News um that's the
most amount of deregulation
ever
and he said the the Biden and Obama
administration treated regulations like
Commandments targeting energy Supply and
raising
costs so and then Trump wants us to be
you know energy dominant so a whole
bunch of regulations going but they're
still focused on making sure there's
clean air and land and and uh basically
clean air land and water while growing
the
economy now assuming this is all true
and assuming that the regulations they
got rid of were things that really were
slowing down our energy
business um I'd expect it would take at
least three
years for the reduction in um in all
these regulations to really show up in
the economy so I feel like Trump's
thirdd year is going to be
insane because a whole bunch of things
he's doing from tariffs to to
deregulation
um those things don't make an immediate
positive impact and might be negative in
the short run but by the third year you
should start seeing it in prices and
then it's going to be crazy so um I
don't think I've ever been more bullish
on the United States now the big the big
thing is still Doge if Doge can't bring
down um the expenses and make that work
then all bets are off but it does look
like it's it's going to make a good run
at it at the very least so I don't think
the United States has been a better
investment maybe at any time since the
toward the end of the Great Depression
you know if if at the end of the
depression you had any money at all and
you bought a few stocks you got really
rich because that was the the worst
looking period in America economic
history but it was also the bottom so if
you bought a stock then you were pretty
happy I feel like we're in a similar
situation now obviously everything could
go to hell because you know any surprise
could Happ happen we get hit by meteor a
war happens that we didn't expect you
know anything could happen
but the the promise of what the third
year of Trump's Administration looks
like i' I don't think I've ever seen a
more
optimistic set of variables coming
together I mean this looks really strong
at this
point well Trump is uh using his uh the
government's control over Federal
funding for college
research to uh put pressure on colleges
so Colombia already lost 400 million in
Grants because the government says
they're they're too anti-semitic or
they're allowing too much
anti-Semitism um and there are
apparently hundreds of schools like
these federal grants for every kind of
research educational medical agriculture
all kinds of research and apparently in
21 the last time we have numbers for it
uh the federal government gave $49
billion for federal research and
development funding $49
billion to colleges which again was a
big part of their entire
funding now what do you think we got for
those $49
billion are you aware of anything that's
coming out of College
research that's changing
anything because you know what I worry
what I worry about is that we got
nothing for it and that it's just a
bunch of people who are rushing to to
publish any kind of science they can
because I don't think we say okay we'll
only give you this money if your if your
research is really good for the economy
and good for
America I doubt it
bet it's a whole bunch of uh we're going
to prove that Dei is the best thing in
the world we're going to prove that
there are more than two genders uh we're
going to
prove I I feel like it's going to be a
whole bunch of just backward science and
random correlations and you know slap
together research with students
collecting data that nobody
trusts and nobody's you know we already
know that the peer Rie peerreview
articles or the peerreview
process doesn't work at all so even
being peer-reviewed doesn't really make
make it true more than half the time
anyway so wouldn't you love to see some
kind of a top 10 here's what we got for
our $49
billion I I feel like most of that was
wasted but I wonder if it's 100% it was
wasted and and I also think to myself if
they were doing research that could be
sort of immediately turned into product
you know Le let's say they were doing
research
on I don't know a new cancer CER or a
new way to make batteries last longer
that is the sort of thing that they
might be doing um how much of that
wouldn't have been funded by
industry I I feel like industry would
have funded that right because it can't
be super expensive to do a study like
that so you know you don't think Tesla
would say okay if you're working on a
way to make our batteries last twice as
long yeah we'll we'll shoot you half a
million for
that so I'm not sure any of this makes
sense that the federal government should
be even in the business of funding
research when Private Industry
presumably would want or funded too
there might be some exceptions but I i'
like to see the argument for why we do
this according to slay news Frank
bergman's writing that the world
economic forum is um is asking for a
global ban on homegrown
food homegrown food uh now they're
talking mostly about Urban Gardens where
people put a little Garden in the middle
of a city and the argument is that these
little gardens are so
inefficient that they contribute more
Badness to the environment than they
producing
food and it would be better if everybody
just got their food from the big
farms instead of trying to grow at home
to which I
say does anybody listen to the world
economic Forum in
20125 I I feel like didn't didn't clouse
uh Schwab already
retire I feel like the world economic
Forum isn't really even a a thing that
anybody pays attention to and here would
be a very good reason why nobody pays
attention it doesn't feel like a 2025
problem does it it it feels like 2020
problem that oh that world economic
Forum they have too much power now it
just seems like a club for rich people
and they put out some weird
proclamations that nobody cares about I
mean none of it's
binding so
anyway um and I guess there are 70 they
did a study of 73 Urban agriculture
sites around the world we don't care uh
Grace price who you know because she
talks about nutrition and food problems
in the United States um she points out
that uh the American Heart
Association has on their
Forum General Mills and
PepsiCo so when you think of things that
are good for your heart do you think of
General Mills and
PepsiCo so they're major members of the
American Heart Association now does that
matter you know do you think do you
think you'll see any impact because
those entities these are on the American
Heart Association well maybe because
there was this bill s SP
379 that uh would have uh removed from
the snap program which is a program for
people without money to buy food um so
right now those people could use the
government money to buy candy soda
cookies and
chips and the
uh and so the there was an effort to say
well you can buy food but we don't think
you should be using the government money
for candy soda cookies and chips now who
do you think
makes at least these soda cookies and
chips to members of the board or the
Forum and uh so the American Heart
Association came out
against
against Banning candy soda cookies and
chips from government funded food
buying they came out against it the
American Heart
Association now let me ask this question
again are there any large organizations
that are not
corrupt I wonder if there
are it it just seems to me
that everything that matters has been
pen pated by somebody who had the
ability to penetrate them so it feels
like there just aren't any large
organizations that you can trust at all
like they all get they all get corrupted
one way or another either through money
or membership or something so there you
go according to
neoscope
neoscope uh newer alab is writing that
uh apparently human intelligence seems
to be dropping sharply
so people are getting Dumber but really
quickly like more so than other times in
history um so apparently it's not just
your
imagination um people are losing the
ability to critically think and to
concentrate and to do reasoning they're
bad at problem solving uh their
information processing skills basically
uh all aspects of intelligence are
dropping like a rock
sort of everywhere in the modern
world and the thinking is that you know
it might be some combination of you know
things in the environment it might be
the food it might be the pollution it
might be the the lead it might be the
phones it might be you know the
screens so you know I I think mostly the
phones if you had to pick one thing it
would be the technology mostly the
phones but I'm going to offer a
Counterpoint you ready for
this yes it's true that a human is
getting Dumber humans so we're all
getting Dumber however we're not a human
anymore we are
cyborg if I have a phone in my hand I'm
smarter than anybody in history has ever
been right as long as I know how to talk
to Ai and ask questions and search for
Stuff uh or even just text somebody who
knows the answer that I want want to
know the answer
to so if you say that people are getting
Dumber that's
true but I wonder if it's
relevant because cyborgs which is what
we are we've evolved into a cyborg State
um a cyborg is way smarter than anybody
in history do you have a question if I
come my phone in my hand I can get an
answer so does it make sense to compare
cyborgs to
humans um without factoring in the fact
that the Cyborg part you know the
technical part gives them the
superpower I don't know I don't know
um I think that even people who are bad
at critical thinking are going to just
start asking their phone
yesterday I wanted to uh heat up some
water for
tea and I'd never done that in the
microwave uh all of my other ways to
make hot water were broken that's
another story so I I have at least
several ways to make hot water are all
broken I've got a hot water spout that's
full of pollution I it's just it's a bad
news so I thought how long do I
microwave this so I took out at GPT and
put it in uh video mode and I
just made it look at my cup of water and
I said how long should I microwave this
it's like well one to two minutes
perfect so there's nothing I can't
figure
out in like a moment it it was kind of
fun anyway according to uh PC Magazine
will mcer is writing about this uh open
AI says that uh China could compel the
Deep seek AI that comes from China to
cause harm and so open AI says that the
Chinese AI should be banned now who's
surprised about that not
me one of the things I've been telling
you about AI is that no matter how good
it is um the problem is going to be the
humans are going to try to ban it for a
number reasons so this is chat GPT
trying to ban Chinese AI
but it seems to me that there is
pressure against open AI to you know
they've got legal pressure there's going
to be the copyright things it's lawyers
lawyers and laws and humans are just
going to be such an impediment to to AI
makes you wonder if AI can ever get to
the next level uh or else we'd stop it
we we'd find some reason it's like oh
it's too dangerous you have to stop oh
it comes from another country you better
stop now I do I I do agree with Banning
the Chinese AI it is too dangerous but
uh there's going to be an argument
against every AI you know pretty soon
people are going to say oh this AI is
biased it's a misinformation so you got
to shut it down the pressure against AI
is going to be just through the
roof anyway we'll see if uh open a wins
that there's a robot Factory being built
interesting engineers in that um so
there's a US firm called
figure that's a robot company and
they're going to build their Factory to
make 12,000 humanoid robots per year and
that's a California based company but
they're not putting the are they putting
the I didn't see that but they couldn't
possibly putting the manufacturing in
California right H it doesn't say where
the manufacturing would be but I'd be
amazed if somebody built Manufacturing
in
California that that feels like an
unnecessary risk so it's a California
based company but I don't see here where
they would put the factory anyway I
wouldn't put it in
California uh anyway I told you the
story about the uh the South African
scientists are trapped in a tiny base in
Antarctica and apparently because of the
extreme weather
there there could be months you know up
to 10 months before the weather would be
good enough for anybody to leave or
arrive and they're complaining because
uh there's one researcher in that group
according to the Daily Mail um who has
been uh threatening to kill them and
sexually sexually abuse somebody so they
got basically some kind of a sexual
criminal who is threatening to kill
people and they're trapped in this
little they're trapped in this little
building for at least 10 more months so
they're sort of begging for a relief now
I know what you're thinking I know what
you're thinking you're thinking can Elon
Musk rescue them right well he can't do
everything I don't think he could land a
Starship there but wouldn't surprised me
if the boring company is already
drilling a hole from America to
Antarctica to get him out wouldn't
surprise me I just don't think it's
happening so no Elon Musk can't rescue
everybody sometimes they going to have
to rescue themselves let's talk about
the
hoodies um as you know the hoodies were
threatening and have for a long time
been threatening shipping in the Red Sea
apparently I didn't realize this but
nearly all the shipping at least our
shipping as uh in other countries too
nearly all of it has been avoiding the
red
because it's too dangerous because of
the hoodies and they've been going the
long way which is making everything cost
a lot more and take a lot longer so
Trump has decided that this Iran back
hoodies that keep shooting at the
shipping in the Red Sea uh their time
has come and National Security adviser
Mike Waltz he confirmed that the US is
making big air stricks and took out
multiple roody
leaders now taking out leaders I don't
think is going to work because they just
get new
leaders and uh nearly three4 of shipping
is now diverted to get out of that area
three qus and it's way more expensive if
they have to go around the hard
way um and then Mike
Heth um he said that uh that there's a
large scale strike campaign going on
against the hoodies and that it will
will continue and be quote
unrelenting until they uh pledge to back
off
um pledge to back off attacking us
Assets Now here again you have that
problem of what if they do promise
it would the shipping return just
because the hoodie said oh yeah we'll
totally leave your shipping
alone because the real problem is the
insurance you would have have to get the
risk down to
zero how can you ever get the risk down
to zero because even if like one in 20
ships get attacked how are any of them
going to get insurance and they need
insurance so you can't you can't
half-ass this thing you have to
completely destroy the hoodie's ability
to do it or completely destroy the
whoever is fun them Iran in this case um
you have to get them to change their
mind but even if they change their mind
they could change it back you know it's
the same problem if they promised oh we
promise uh yeah we we won't attack your
ships and then a a few ships come back
they only have to attack one and then
the whole thing falls apart
so how much do you have to
kill before you can guarantee that it
will be economical for ships to use that
place again like you either have to wipe
out everything in that area man woman
and child I'm not recommending that I'm
just saying if you wanted to fix it you
would have to actually just depopulate
the place because
they're they don't seem to be afraid of
anything and there always seems to be a
replacement willing to take over and
there's always going to be a new leader
and Iran will still be funding him so
anything sure
of a kind of brutality that we've never
seen before couldn't possibly make a
difference so we'll we'll see if this
gets us
anything um I'm highly skeptical that it
can be solved without doing something
that would be so unconscionable to
American Minds
that doing it would be going too
far I don't know you know if the real
lever is Iran then maybe there maybe
there's something to work
with but I don't know you have to get
the risk down to zero or it just doesn't
even matter you know if the risk is 5%
you know down from 100% getting attacked
down to 5% I don't think that changes
the insurance situation at all because
because 5% is way too much of a risk way
too much it's not even close so we'll
see anyway that's what I got for you
today uh I'm going to say a few words
privately to the local subscribers but
for the rest of you thanks for joining
happy St Patrick's Day uh so I'll say
goodbye to YouTube and Rumble and x and
locals I'm coming at you in 30 seconds
privately we'll have another
sip
