well with any luck at all there'll be
something like a show I'm going to print
my my notes for today while everybody
streams
in just can't can't seem to remember to
turn off the sound there but now it's
good all right ladies and
gentlemen to the
printer
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human
civilization have a little problem with
their comments here which I will fix in
one
moment
boom you know if you'd like your uh
experience today to go up to levels that
even the eclipse can't understand it's
going to be easy
tell you how to do it in a moment as
soon as this is
fixed there we
go
nope interesting all right so the app's
not working uh but I can see your
comments on the uh mobile or on the uh
whatever the hell this is you know when
I
all right nothing's
working let's try again let's try one
more time well we actually may maybe
actually do a show
today but let's see I don't see any
comments on the
chat I don't see the so there's no
locals
comments looks like locals just isn't
working so everything but
locals
great I try it one more
time it's probably just a reboot
problem
nope
man it literally worked 60 seconds
ago oh oh I know what the prise I know
the promise or do
I
well
see if I have two things
open that might be problem might be I
might have two things open
here yep there it is that's the problem
I had two streams
open I was crossing
streams but
now should be
perfect God
damn oh I want to throw all of my
equipment into the
ocean because I don't have comments on
anything I can try on a second
machine because it really does change
the
experience pretty sure my second machine
will
work all right watch this working
perfectly come
on
huh
nope all right well I guess I don't have
a comment option this
morning oh there we go look at that just
it just came back to
life we got comments we got everything
we're going to do the simultaneous hip
just like the morning hadn't been a
total disaster so far are you with me
let's pretend none of this happened can
we just rewind that like I a few minutes
all right here's a simultaneous hip all
you need for that is a cuper m glasses
ankerstein a Cen jug plas of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid I like
cofy join me now for the unparallel of
the dope iMed of the day thing makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous SI it happens now
go
there we go we got comments everybody's
in the house we are 100%
cooking couldn't be any
better well are you going to watch the
eclipse today I hear is going to be
amazing yeah um the only thing I have to
say about it is if I ever start a robot
barber shop where robots cut your hair I
will name it eclipse
if it's not already
taken uh here's my uh entertainment
suggestion for today if you like Star
Trek the fif season of Discovery is on
now I think they spelled Discovery wrong
they spell it d i s c o v r y Discovery
but I think they're leaving out the E
should be
Dei s oov Discovery d I Discovery so
it's
basically the the wokest version of Star
Trek
and but I must say they did a great job
of picking the lead the lead actor and
actress so although it's a super woke
and so the captain's got to be a black
woman they picked a really good
character so you know sometimes
sometimes the Dei works this is one of
those cases I think that writing is
still too female way too many
relationships like everybody's in love
and talking nice to each other so the
whole show seems like a some kind of
female fantasy where men are nice to
[Laughter]
people but I got to say the uh the lead
actors and actor and actress are
great if you like that kind of thing um
I'm going to give you a lesson on how to
know you are irrational you ready for
this do you ever think hey those other
people are irrational but man I got some
good arguments in me here are some
things that if you hear these things
come out of your mouth you are an
irrational person and the other person
should walk away from
you word number one this is a red flag
should if you're ever having a debate
with somebody and so and they say what
should happen or what we should do
sometimes it's just the way people
talk right so if you can get them to say
it a different way then maybe they have
a point but if the only thing they have
is should they're trying to win the
argument with a word instead of an
argument should says you should do it
but where's the
argument So it's b should could be um
could be substituted with it's the
correct decision here's the actual
definition of should it's used indicate
obligation Duty or
correctness obligation Duty or
correctness that's not an argument an
argument is not you know obligation is
arguable duty is always arguable
correctness is always arguable so it's
basically trying to win the argument by
telling somebody that the word can
substitute for thinking so he should is
a huge red flag I do it all the time by
the way I make the same
mistake
here's another one uh
fairness it would only be fair if we do
this fairness was invented as a word so
that idiots and children would have
something to talk about oh it's not fair
oh it's not fair fairness is not an
argument there's nothing in the world
that's fair Sometimes the best systems
are the unfair ones such as capitalism
have you heard of it free markets not
exactly Fair but we can't do anything
better usually and then there's the
analogy argument analogies are good for
explaining what you're talking about but
they're not arguments you can't say uh
Hitler like cats therefore you're Hitler
that's not an argument that's
crazy so look for these keywords in my
my presentation
today by the way if all goes well I
think I'm scheduled for a spaces audio
event on X today at uh what would be
3:30 Eastern Time 12:30 my time in
California so look for that on Spaces on
all topics I
think all right here's my theme for
today we can't measure anything
complicated and it's the biggest problem
in in
governing we think we we have this
imaginary tot magical thinking that
humans can measure complicated things
not only can we not do that we've never
done it on
anything you you could measure it and
try to convince people you measured it
right but you can't really know let me
tell you where I learned that used to be
my job when I worked in big corporations
first big bank and then later at the
phone
company uh it was usually my job to go
find some information about about a
complicated thing for example if we were
to make this complicated decision versus
this complicated decision which one
turns out better so it' be for me to
figure that
out and I'd be measuring all manner of
complicated things and one day I was
measuring the trying to measure the
performance of each of the bran the
branch banks I've told this story before
but it it fits really well with the
point and I was working directly for a
senior vice president
and he uh I I asked for a meeting with
him I said you know I know you asked me
to measure the performance of all the
branches that you manage so you can know
which managers below you are doing a
good job but in collecting the
information I've determined that they
they compile their own information in
different ways and therefore the it's
not possible to measure who's doing
better you would only be randomly
looking at data that you knew was not
good
so I said well maybe we shouldn't do
this because the data is definitely just
random and the senior vice president
looked at me and he said that's okay I'm
only going to use it when it agrees with
what I was thinking
anyway another words if he thought a
manager needed to go and by coincidence
my number said he wasn't doing a good
job totally randomly well then he'd use
it and he bring it and say look you're
doing a bad job you're fired but if the
numbers didn't agree with what he wanted
to do he would just ignore the numbers
and say well for reasons you're
fired now I said to myself well this is
one unique situation
here imagine a situation where the
people who are paid to compile data and
tell you what's true what if they were
all bought off in some way you know
didn't want to get fired so they were
willing to say something that wasn't
true well that was was me that was me as
a young corporate
employee my senior senior boss Harvard
MBA told me that using random data was
fine because it's all fake
anyway and I just went through with the
sh the shro the charade the shro
whichever you
prefer and I just pretended like it was
actually some meaningful work and I'd
come to work and I'd do my ridiculous
job
of measuring things that I couldn't
actually measure and I knew it and that
nobody should use these numbers and we
use them just like they were real does
that remind you of
anything climate
change or
elections measuring
inflation how's the job growth hard to
say literally everything that we make
decisions about well well there's a few
few exceptions yeah um but most things
are that we make big government
decisions on are based on the illusion
that we can measure big complicated
things we've never been able to do that
not anywhere ever in the history of
humankind yeah we don't even know we
can't even be sure if the vaccinations
were good for us or bad for us just just
hold that in your mind we can't agree if
the vaccinations were good for us or bad
for us
no I know you have your opinions but I'm
saying we don't agree on how to measure
it we don't agree on anything there's no
such thing as a complicated situation in
which we have any idea what's going on
and we never will it's not doable Beyond
some level of complication can't measure
anything but we believe we
can
um so there's a uh
so rasmuson did a poll 83% of Voters
expect the issue of inflation to be
important all right so inflation
according to rasmuson one of the top
concerns so You' think it'd be pretty
important if we can measure the
inflation and really understand where
it's coming from right one of the
biggest
things well here's a related
story uh a recent study in uh there's a
scientific journal called
nature uh they did a study and they
found out that one of the causes of
inflation is climate
change really seriously there's a
scientific journal that used to be
considered uh
authoritative and people used to think
was you know something they could trust
called nature and uh yeah now did I need
to read the
article do you think that was an article
I should p into and see what their
argument is no I don't need to read that
article it's so obviously not
true how in the world do they not know
that energy costs are our biggest
problem influencing all the other sub
costs and that the energy costs are high
because of fighting climate
change inflation isn't caused by climate
change is caused by fighting climate
change very much caused by it now I
don't have to measure that because I
know that if you pass a trillion dollar
budget to fight climate change you add a
little inflation I know that if you
restrict drilling well supply and demand
I don't have to measure it supply and
demand doesn't Su sometimes work a
different way it's like I don't have to
measure whether if I let something go
from my hand it'll drop to the ground
because I've heard of gravity right you
don't have to measure it you know it's
going down
so the fact that there would be a major
publication that could even entertain
that as a story tells you that either
scientists don't know anything about
inflation or people who know about
inflation don't know anything about
science but it's very unlikely there's
somebody who knows enough about both and
they could actually accurately measure
any of that stuff all right how about
how about
this here's your mind Bender for today
climate scientists tell us that we know
what the temperature is lately because
we have very uh very Advanced measuring
devices and that they're all over not
all over but they're in thousands of
places and so the way we measure the
temperature is by going to the
thermometers and looking at them writing
it down so that's pretty good right now
why why is it that we have
thermometers instead of like just you
know licking your finger and holding it
up well I assume I wasn't there when the
decision was made but I assume you need
thermometers because it's hard to tell
the temperature without
them but yet we compare the readings on
our thermometers to the temperature from
hundreds and sometimes thousands of
years
ago but we didn't have thermometers
then so let me see if I can understand
this we as the public have been
told that we know exactly what the
temperature was and what it is now and
the way we know it in the past is from
tree rings and Ice core samples and a
number of other environmental things and
that we can do that accurately enough
and also measure what the CO2 was you
know back in those same times we can do
that accurately enough that we could
compare it to our modern uh instrument
ments and have something like a a
logical rational straight line of you
know what the temperature been over
time that's right the scientists
convinced you that the reason we need
modern thermometers is because we can't
measure the temperature easily without
them and then they measure the
temperature of what it was hundreds of
years without them and then compar that
to what we get with our modern
thermometers and then I don't know if
you knew this but most of you know that
the thermometers suffer from being near
heat Islands in other words they might
have been somewhere there was a good
place to measure things before but then
maybe you know the city grows out or
whatever I thought that was a
problem I saw a claim today with with
some examples um that almost all of the
all of the measurements are on
airports is that true the almost all of
the thermometers are on airports meaning
that the the heat from the Jets and the
concrete and everything are basically
determining everything and then we put
thermometers on concrete and compared it
to our tree
rings that really happened there there
are people in your government who are
selling you on the idea that they put
thermometers on concrete in the modern
day and then compared those accurate
readings to their tree rings and their
ice core samples and they're like well
we nailed it this
time nothing complicated can be
measured there's no
exception nothing complicated can be
measured people don't have that ability
humans don't have anything like that
ability not for anything not ever not
once not ever
nope we can do pretty well when the math
does does the job you know like putting
a spaceship into orbit
you know the math and physics are pretty
good so we can do that stuff but that's
not like measuring something that's a
little
different all right how about uh our
elections we can totally totally measure
who won an election
right and then we would know if it's
fair and if we should do it
differently these are all absurdities we
couldn't possibly know who won that
election the only way you could know is
if it was just a blowout but if it's
close no we don't have the ability to
know who won not even close you don't
believe me let's see what uh what's
going on in
Maricopa as we speak Carrie Lake and
Mark finchum so they've got this uh new
brief they filed with the Supreme Court
and among their
claims are the Maricopa you know which
which is a place there's a lot of
controversy about the outcome uh the
Maricopa did not do the required LNA
testing for their machines and used
altered and hens uncertified
software the claim is that the county
used a um they used they used the
certified software which was approved
for use in
Arizona um but it was
altered um in some way and then then the
county only tested they only tested the
software on five spares they didn't test
it on the
actual uh
tabulators so the things they tested
they they tested the software they
didn't
use really they saw they tested the
software they didn't use and then when
they got the software that they did use
they only tested on some test machines
you not the actual ones that were going
to be used in the field so so we don't
know for sure according to this
claim whether those machines
work we don't know if uh mail carriers
are throwing away ballots how would we
know that how would you know if the mail
men don't just get together and say or
the male women and get together and just
say you know what if you're picking up a
Bella from this neighborhood maybe just
throw it away because it's lot Trump
voters there how do we know we wouldn't
know so if you think you can know who
won an election I'm pretty sure that the
whole point of el of uh of voting
machines is so you can't know our our
elections are completely designed so you
don't
know what what is the impact of Google
rigging search results well according to
your researcher Dr Epstein it complet
changes how you vote what is the impact
of you know Mark Zuckerberg and Law
changes and Mark Elias and what what's
the effect of changing things to mailin
ballots and all that the effect is we
have no idea if the will of the people
had anything to do with the
outcome right now I'm not saying
something illegal happened
necessarily I don't have you know proof
of some illegal things
specifically
but you can see from the design that is
designed to keep you from knowing who
won you can't know that's completely
unknowable and you won't know the next
time and you won't know the time after
the only time you'll
know is if uh it's a blowout and that
doesn't happen because they can prevent
the blowout from
happening so things that Democrats
believe to be true it's kind of funny
they think elections are designed to be
secure they're not even designed for
that they're very much designed to be
you know so you can't
tell
um and that Republicans stage
insurrections without guns and you can
measure the temperature of the earth now
and hundreds of years
ago those are all
absurdities they're total
absurdities and we our entire system is
based on us arguing over absurdities as
if we could any of this stuff
anyway speaking of things that aren't
true uh there's something called the
Bren the Brennan Center of
Justice uh well anyway so according to
them um the the CIA wants to expand
their ability to uh spy on Americans who
no not Americans spy on uh people in
other countries which of course will be
used against America go directly or
indirectly so the CIA says it doesn't
have enough authority to spy on people
and what they want to do is they want to
have this Authority specifically so they
can go after the fenel
business yeah so the CIA wants more
Authority for
spying so they can uh crack down on the
fenel
business people the CIA doesn't want the
fental business to end that couldn't
possibly be true
it it's like they threw a dart at a
board and said uh we need we need extra
powers to surveil people because uh
climate change climate change requires
us to have extra powers to surveil well
that's ridiculous oh well fentanyl how
about
fentanyl yeah yeah that's it the
fenol no no that doesn't make any
sense uh because you haven't done
anything up to this
point here's my take on the CIA and
fenel
observationally can't prove it but the
observation is that nothing useful is
being done to stop fentanyl so it must
be
intentional the design of the system
tells you its purpose now if it's if the
purpose isn't being met in the short run
then you'd expect people to change the
system pretty quickly but if a system
has been in place for years and the
people who could change it let's say the
CIA still let it stay and it gets worse
you have to assume they want it to get
worse or as part of some larger play I
assume that the fenel business is
enriching the cartel and the cartel
works with the CIA to pacify the Central
American countries and countries who
want to control through dirty means so I
think my guess is that the Fentanyl and
the CIA are all part of the same process
I don't think they're going to use their
new surveillance to stop the fenol
business that just feels like they throw
a dart at the list of reasons that sound
good oh you know what there's too much
discrimination in the world too much uh
you know systemic racism so we need some
more powers of
surveillance I swear to God they just
picked this randomly fental that'll
sound good throw that in the
mix now I don't believe any anything
about
that uh there's more evidence that uh
exercise is better than counseling or
quote the leading
medications so yet yet another study
that says physical activity is one and a
half times better than counseling or
what they call the leading medic
medications why did they have to use
that word
leading now one reason would be that
they only bothered to study you know the
the biggest most prescribed drugs that
could be one reason what would be
another reason they would say the
leading medications exercise is better
than the leading
medications could it be that they're
fully aware that mushrooms maybe crom
and maybe some other things DMT perhaps
could it be that they're aware that
those are way more useful than either uh
the big Pharma stuff or exercise
because I think that might be the case I
don't know but you know anecdotally when
people talk about it they say I one dose
fix me forever that sort of thing and so
I think they were careful in their
language
here now do we do we believe this is
true remember I told you you can't
measure anything
complicated can we measure the exercise
gives you a better outcome than
medications is that
complicated not super complicated you
just ask people did you exercise did you
take a drug which one so I think in
theory this isn't super complicated but
it doesn't mean it's true because we've
seen even simple polling situations
where you think it would be easy to
gather the data and they gather it
backwards you know they get the cause
and effect backwards so even if it's
simple sometimes they don't get it right
but it's at least within the it's within
the realm of something we might might be
able to measure as human
beings well Google apparently has not
fixed its uh Gemini AI uh image
generator they got it in trouble because
it was making everybody look black
because it was so woke that they wanted
George Washington to look black and
everybody
else and now there's some noise that
it's an indication that maybe the CEO
sundor pich should be out of a job
because it's taking so long to fix the
product that's probably the future of
Google itself the
AI and I've got a different take on
this I don't think that the delay in
fixing it is because the CEO is
incapable or even
unwilling here's what I think I think
it's logically
impossible I don't think they can fix it
I don't know what they're going to do
but they can't make their product less
woke because they've hired a company
full of woker
so the moment that it does anything
that's not um let's say proper to their
philosophies there's no way it's going
to be allowed so I think what you saw
was not a mistake which they'll go back
and fix I think you saw a permanent
situation that can't be fixed with their
current company I mean I think the only
way to fix it would be to Outsource it
to some company that did their own
hiring and Google did
not in other words Google might have to
design a
system that takes into account that they
hired people who can't make decisions
like
this literally have to use outside
people because all their inside people
are so infected with wokeness that you
couldn't trust them to make a decision
the market could live with I think
that's what's going on logically
impossible it might be logically
impossible because the training data is
based on the real world and the real
world is completely distorted by people
pretending to be
woke so if you're only training your AI
on what people have said how does the AI
know that the people were all lying or
their weasels I mean if you look at the
whole you know Dei Network it's people
who know they're lying it's people who
are saying what they know has to be said
then you have you know weird Mark Cuban
situations where it's hard to believe he
never knew what Dei was in the real
world and yet he's arguing in public and
then he creates a big body of
conversation which is purely absurd and
then what AI trains on it how how does
AI know that if it's looking at
everything that Mark Cuban said on the
topic that it doesn't even make sense to
humans when we look at it like I don't
even know what's going on here what what
are you doing
that anyway so I don't think it could be
fixed uh maybe good news the uh big
Taiwan Semiconductor Company
tsmc world's biggest chip maker uh looks
like they're going to do a deal to make
some chips in Arizona in
2028 which seems like not very long from
now I feel like that's not going to
happen you know I feel like nothing ever
happens that quickly four years seems
like just too short because we have all
kind of environmental problems as
Etc I read something somewhere but I
don't know if it was true that the
founder of taiwan's biggest chipmaker
tsmc tried to build it in Texas but I
think it was the regulations were too
extreme and there was something that the
United States was preventing him from
doing so he had to go to
Taiwan so it was one of like the biggest
mistakes our country's ever made you
know letting this chip company go to
Taiwan but maybe we'll get some of it
back um a survey conducted by change
research last year found that nearly 2/3
of women in the 18 to 34 category
identified as Progressive or liberal so
2third of young women are progressor
liil while just more than one-third of
young men identify the same
way can most of you can confirm that
from your own experience I I'm told that
locally where I live the the girls are
woke and the boys think it's
stupid what do you think in fact the the
boys just don't have a they don't have a
twinge of wokeness in the middle at
all now add to that so what is 18 to 34
year old women what do they have in
common 18 to 34 year old women well they
are in their peak of fertility and you
know ability to
healthily have a
child and they've managed to talk
themselves into a situation thank you
Tik Tock for making this possible in
which 2third of them two-thirds of women
could never have a relationship with
2third of the
men so 2third of all women would find it
impossible to get in a relationship with
any one of 2third of all the men
now add on top of that after you take
the first two-thirds out he's got to be
you know sexy and have a high income
he's got to be six feet tall and have a
penis that drags on the ground when he
walks you know normal
stuff we don't have a chance of
reproducing you all see it
right you don't have to you don't have
to be measuring a complicated thing
we've created a situation that can't
can't possibly reproduce
ourselves and that's Tick
Tock there's no way this happened
organically would you all know that
right there's no way it happened
organically it's happening from social
media period it's social media and what
ones do what social media do young girls
use the most well
ticktock now you might say to yourself
but Scott what about the other American
companies that are turning kids trans to
which I say I don't think they have
nearly as much influence I don't even
know anybody who watches
Facebook you do you know any young
people who use Facebook I don't
um and anyway so we basically have
ourselves in a situation where Tik Tock
has cancelled uh reproductive
possibilities in America
so so Tik Tok will be banned right
because it's really like really obvious
that it's destroyed the United
States probably permanently just by
removing our ability to
reproduce so we'll ban it right no no
because probably somebody's making money
from it and that's all you need to
know all right um we'll talk about Trump
he's got some interesting things going
on uh this is funny so apparently NBC
News was reporting on this what makes
makes it even
funnier so remember in 2016 the
Democrats were yelling get Trump off the
air why do you give him so much air time
don't show his rally kick him off of the
old Twitter cancel him from social media
and they thought the only way they could
win was to silence them
well so now he they successfully got him
off of social media you know so he's
little siloed into truth we still see it
but it's you know reported as something
that was
untruth and we see that uh he's so busy
with his
lawfare that he's not you know doing his
normal Trump thing so he's getting a lot
less attention do you know what they're
saying now the only way we can beat him
is if we give him more
attention yeah I'm not making that up
they went from the only thing that can
kill us is giving him too much attention
to the only thing that can kill us is if
we don't give him enough attention
because otherwise people won't know how
bad he is so we got to show him in his
own words doing stuff because then
you'll know how bad he is do you think
the Democrats are completely lost that
their best strategy is to give them too
much attention followed by too little
and that either way loses and they
haven't figured out what's wrong
yet yeah I do think that Trump is
benefiting by not getting as much
attention would you agree that his
campaign is
operating
probably I don't know if this is true
but I'm I'm going to put that out there
he might be running
Trump the best political
campaign of my lifetime I'm not positive
about that I'm no political historian
but it's really close to
Flawless it's really close and we'll
talk more about what he's getting right
but he's really really running a strong
strong campaign the the the worst news
he gets he does reframe
successfully the worst news is the you
know the lawfare and he made it work
totally made it work you know he gets a
banned uh communication wise and he
makes that work too he's just making it
all work so that's
fun um so Trump has finally come out
with his statement on
abortion which we all been waiting for
now the the trouble here is if he went
strong on Banning
abortions um he'd have no chance of
winning and the Republicans would be
routed but if he didn't come out strong
against abortion then he might might
lose support among conservatives and
lose that way so it looked like he had
two ways to lose he could either lose
Republican votes and he's dead or he can
definitely not get any
Independence he's dead so had two ways
to lose so what did Trump
do split that baby right in
half so he says it should be left up to
the states abortion
should he says Le left to the states to
do the right thing on abortion and he
said Democrats are radical on the issue
uh for not wanting any restrictions and
he says that he strongly supports IVF so
inv vitro fertilization to create babies
and uh that is definitely opposes a
number of people in his own party but
the way he sold it
was um the Republicans are always in
favor of life and might be the only way
to make these beautiful babies as says
and we need more beautiful babies and
IVF is one of the key Technologies for
helping people make babies and he's pro
lifee pro baby he wants big beautiful
families and IVF helps create big
beautiful families and we're
done now will he lose some people who
think IVF is a form of abortion because
there's some
fertilized or eggs or something that get
destroyed or frozen forever and it seems
unkind
so
um what do you think of that
answer and he does go on to say that he
supports the Reagan likee um ability to
get an abortion if you're uh if there's
rape or incest or the health of the
mother so he tried to split the
baby now here's a
strategy you make the Democrats a little
mad but not so mad that they're animated
about abortion you just want to take
some energy out if he had said no
abortions no IVF there would be so much
energy behind abortion but if you say
how about you States decide and I stay
out of it and how about if you want IVF
IVF you can have
it split the baby so the idea here is
that the Democrats aren't getting what
they want but they can very clearly see
that he opposed his own party or part of
it part of his own party to
compromise you don't really see that a
president try to be everybody's
president and that's what he
did this is probably I know I I can't
even think of another example think of
another example where a president said
look we're going to have to find a
middle ground so I'm going to make make
my own my own people a little bit
unhappy going to make you guys a maybe a
little bit more than unhappy but this is
this is where it works you know it's
it's the closest you can get to
something that
works so people will argue about it but
I think he did as well as you can do in
finding a workable solution where it
won't eliminate him from getting
elected I don't think it's an automatic
elimination
I don't think it's an automatic you know
good news I don't think he'll gain votes
I think he may have just successfully
found the narrow pathway where it
doesn't change things one way or another
too
much now uh a number of people asked if
you know I had any influence on this
because it looks like something I said
before
um but when I read
[Music]
uh when I read the language it looks a
little bit more like
V meaning meaning the the way he split
the baby was clever enough and had
enough
Nuance that it kind of looked like he's
just getting great advice and not for me
in this
case you probably heard me say that uh
here's what I tweeted yesterday I said
that when men are involved in abortion
lawmaking it automatically becomes
telling women what they could can do
with their bodies which I totally
understand have any of you men ever done
the exercise where you say well how
would I feel if I were a woman in this
situation I would feel if men were
involved in the abortion decision in any
capacity you know of the lawmaking not
not just opinion but the lawmaking and
the voting and stuff I would feel like
men were telling me what to do with my
body and I wouldn't like it now before
you say but Scott that's not logical and
we have a reason I'm not talking about
logic or Reason that's a whole different
domain I'm talking about how youd
feel and I would feel that the decision-
making was
illegitimate because I would think let
the women work this out we'll tell you
once we've figured it out that's what I
would think if I were a
woman so I wouldn't begrudge anybody for
thinking it if they are a
woman um so it's it's sort of baked into
men being evolved makes it look like
telling women what to do with their
bodies and you know that's true because
the women say it exactly that way
they're trying to tell us what to do
with our bodies they say it exactly that
way you don't have to wonder what
they're thinking it's right on the top
of the
messaging but suppose that Republicans
or anybody else said you know what
everybody gets a vote because that's the
system everybody gets an opinion because
that's the system Free Speech but if we
want if we want a situation that we can
live with given how divisive this
is maybe let the women take the
lead now I got all kinds of push back on
this from people who don't know how to
think and I'm going to be maybe a little
brutal on you because maybe you'll this
will be the first time you figure out
your analytical
abilities uh a whole lot of people told
me what should happen should there's
that word if your argument is men should
have a
say that's not a reason for example men
should have a say because they're they
get on the hook for the finances does
that make sense no you tried to make
that make sense by putting the word
should there it doesn't make sense by
itself you're trying to sell it as
making sense it's a true fact that men
are put on the line it's not a true fact
that therefore they should have an
opinion about the
abortion here's what is
logical let the women decide what they
do with their bodies but let men be part
of the decision about who pays for
what right because if your decision is
who pays for it that's not exactly the
same as telling you what to do with your
body that's tell you don't do this with
my
wallet stay out of my wallet how about
how about the um the way that would be
most stable is that men feel they're not
being abused because they get some
control over decisions about their
wallets and women don't feel like
somebody a bunch of men decided what to
do with their bodies so you just let the
women take the lead everybody still has
their vote everybody can still say their
opinion but just let the women take the
lead
and here is the point if you have a
situation which cannot and will not be
resolved and abortion cannot and will
not be resolved like where we all agree
and it's life and death I mean really
big
stakes in those cases the best thing you
can do is make sure that the way the
decision is made is credible it's the
best you can do the only thing that will
hold Society together is if you say oh I
hate that but I have to admit the system
they used to come up with that
idea that was a valid system I just
didn't go the way I like it you can live
with that right so if it's not a valid
system people won't live with it and I
don't think that women would uh see the
abortion question as completely valid if
men have too much of a you know a thumb
on the
decision now how many people understood
that
point I if you look online and look at
the
comments summarizing my point we'll
never agree so the best you can do is
agree on how to how to make the decision
you know what's the most valid credible
way to do it and nobody could understand
that they just told me their
opinion and and just telling me your
opinion has never worked before like it
never made anybody agree you never
change anybody's mind because you made
your good opinion although people do
change their mind on abortion that's the
thing all right so the persuasion tip is
this if Society can't agree on an issue
and never
will if we can't agree and we never
will then you don't just keep arguing
about it and that's what we've been
doing up to this point we'll never agree
we don't agree and it's never going to
get fixed the agreeing part will never
get fixed so you have to leave that
domain because it's a losing domain all
you do is just get angry and nothing
happens so you have to go to the domain
of well at least we can figure some
credible way to make a decision and for
me if women were by some solid
majority in favor of some set of uh laws
I would say even if I didn't like those
laws I can live with that I could live
with
that all right
so Trump is not where I'm at I've gone
further than he went but in terms of
what is practical and useful and
realistic in today's world probably
nailed it I I think if he went all the
way to women should take the lead he
would have the trouble that I got into
which is people don't quite understand
the argument they just yell about the
money which is really just a separate
argument it's a good one but it's a
separate argument then what do you do
with your
body all right so Trump has violated the
gag order from the judge
merchin
and so now we have uh I guess they could
put Trump in jail for 30 days and or
find him
$1,000 they could put him in jail for 30
days and or find him
$1,000 what kind of what kind of choices
are those the guy's worth $9 billion or
whatever it is
today $1,000 is literally
zero but3 days in jail is like changing
the
Republic if there's
any this is just so absurd everything
about this is
absurd but I do love the fact that uh
Trump has thrown them The Gauntlet and
he said this is too far and just not
going to do it put me in jail
jail what would happen if he if he
actually got put in jail besides winning
in the landslide what would
happen what would you
do would anybody act differently would
you go there and surround the
jail well I don't think he'll go to jail
I think he's properly assessing the
risks and there just no
way because the country would just fly
apart at that at that point we would
just fly apart so I don't think
it's going to happen maybe you'll get
find a thousand dollars which would be
funny well let's talk about Brazil that
hell hole of
Brazil uh so the current leader of
Brazil won in a tight election which the
people who know more than I do the Mike
Ben of the world um seem to think that
America meddled in their elections and
we that we have our fingerprints all
over Brazil and that Americans be using
Brazil to get at and using Europe as
well to get at the social media
companies that they can't censor
directly so it's basically a whole play
where our CIA uses other countries and
talks them into Banning the platforms
then it would be too expensive for the
platforms to keep stay in business uh
and make what they used to make for
their
stakeholders and uh that they would be
forced to bend to the the European
company country's will which is really
our will meaning the CIA trying to get
rid of free
speech um and as you know musk has
decided to
um he's decided to avoid
that and um just ignore the ban and not
so what Brazil asked was for them to uh
censor and ban certain individuals they
didn't like didn't like the messages
from them and musk not going to do that
in fact musk recommended on X that if
you're in Brazil and you want to use x
get a
VPN does that really
work is there any downside to having a
VPN I mean I know it works but is there
a downside that I don't know about or is
it really that
simple because here's what I'd do if I
were if I would uh musk I would pick a
VPN to partner with and then I would
spam every Brazilian users with VPN
commercial for free free commercial and
I might even maybe help fund it how
about a free
VPN for uh anybody who oh here we go a
free VPN for anybody who gets a blue
check imagine that because a VPN can't
cost that much right it's a piece of
software am I wrong that it's not super
expensive to create and market a VPN it
doesn't sound like the highest level of
difficulty so couldn't couldn't X have
its own
VPN and simply make it available to
anybody maybe anybody wants to use it
maybe maybe not just check marks but
make it available to
everybody would would that be good
enough he probably need to make it free
or else Brazil wouldn't have enough
subscribers I think probably have to
make it
free
well let me tell you that would be a
hell of an interesting experiment to see
if musk could engineer their their
concern because if he Engineers It Away
by giving VPN so Brazil can't tell who's
doing
what what would they do what would be
the response I don't know exactly but it
would be a strong play I don't know if
it's a good one but it'd be a strong
play well so everything in Brazil
appears to be rigged um not just by
Americans but um I I mean I wouldn't
trust anything that come comes out of
the Brazilian government at this point
and meanwhile in the United States Biden
commissioned a study to study the court
structure that would include uh packing
the court with 13 members so that they
could get their
majority now what did I tell you when
people were not crazy tell you tell the
people who are crazy that they're going
to study
it this sounds like reparations doesn't
it you know because Gavin Nome is not
crazy you might not like him and he
might be you know kind of slick but he's
not crazy so he knows that um that
reparations would be a losing a losing
strategy but he can't say no to it and
saying no would be bad but saying yes
would be
worse so Nome creates a reparations
committee
and then they finish while he's still in
office and he's like damn it they
finished I'm going to have to listen to
the recommendation so he listens to the
recommendation is like you know I need
to know more go back and study that some
more is basically how bureaucracies make
people go away why don't you form a
committee and get back to me because
Biden to his
credit has said directly in the past and
not that distant past that if you mess
with the Supreme Court it's a giant it's
a giant error basically the huge error
the biggest in the Republic basically if
you're going to pack the courts you
might as well just say the the
Republic's done and just tell us who our
new bosses is tell us which way we have
to bow just tell us who who took over
like give us a name we'll play along we
don't have any choice
apparently anyway uh I do think that
Biden is just uh playing with his own
progressives I think he has no intention
of packing the court because it would be
a third rail political suicide and he
would know that even with dementia he
would know
that all right here's H some more bad
behavior so
Democrats um the Biden Administration
comma announced that they're giving uh$
20 billion doll to a bunch of different
uh climate
change
entities for example you got your uh
climate United f your Coalition for
green Capital your power forward
communities your opportunity Finance
Network your inclusives your Justice
climate fund your appalachi community
capital in the native cdfi Network just
to name a
few what do you think this is really $20
billion to solve a problem that we can't
even measure well enough to know if it
exists 2020
billion well let me tell you what it
looks like it looks like a gigantic
money laundering scam grifty thing do
you think that any of the heads of these
organizations you've never heard of do
you think any of them are
Republicans no not even a little chance
of that they're all Democrats and do you
think that these organizations might oh
I don't know find a way to kick back a
little bit do you think this is just a
way for a bunch of people to get rich on
your money yes yes I believe that this
is completely
fraudulent I don't think there's even a
hint of anything honest about this this
is the most clearly obviously engineered
fraud that you'll ever
see now if they were giving if they were
giving like a bunch of money to say one
entity or maybe they were guaranteeing
some loans or something you could kind
of keep an eye on it and you know maybe
you'd know something about that one
entity but what what what can you
conclude when there's lots of different
complexity you know oh you can't even
Trace where this money's
going is basically they just spraying it
into the environment in a way it's most
likely to come back to them I don't even
think this has anything to do with
climate change I don't even I don't even
know if they even thought of climate
change when they did this to me this
looks exactly like an organized Rico
scam now it might all be legal because
people just don't say the words that
would make it illegal but in but in
action it just looks like a crime is it
criminal probably not because everybody
just has to use other
words literally they can turn a crime
into not a crime with
words if they use the words hey we don't
know if any of this is going to help
climate change but if you give us a
billion dollars and we'll all give
ourselves paychecks and you know what we
might donate to your campaign too how
about
that yeah so that's what it looks like
to
me looks like a big old
scam who was it who was in charge of uh
allocating the gigantic amounts of money
for climate change does anybody remember
the person that Joe Biden put in charge
of deciding where all the billions and
billions will go for fighting climate
change wasn't it
podesta I'm I'm operating by memory but
was it John podesta or do I have that
wrong give me a fact check on that
I think it was John podesta
right all right I'm not seeing a fact
check on
that well it used to be John krey but
didn't he get out I thought John krey
got out of that business I thought he
retired from
that really but what does podesta do I
thought podesta got the job of deciding
yeah it is pesta
right now if it's podesta the fix is
clearly in
like he's a giant red flag that this is
not
real what why would why would this
lawyer loyalist to Hillary Clinton be in
charge of allocating money to climate
change what exactly is his expertise for
doing
that none he's just the most loyal
political guy that's it so obviously
this is a big grifty scammy Rico
situation but he'll be smart enough to
say the right words we're battling
climate
change well here's a giant surprise for
you can you believe that the Russians
have determined that the terrorists who
attacked Moscow it turns out they all
say under heavy torture that it was
Ukraine yeah who would have known that
if you torture them they would say
Ukraine the exact thing you wanted them
to say now is it possible it's also
completely true yes it
is which which is if they if it's not
true that's why it would be a good lie
because it certainly looks true um so
the idea is that the terrorists admitted
that it was uh Ukraine or somebody in
Ukraine who was going to pay them a
bunch of money and they had to escape
back to Ukraine and then they would get
a million
Rubles if they pulled it off and got
back and allegedly the Ukrainian Armed
Forces was in on it and blah blah blah
but they were
tortured in Russia they call it
interrogating but they were tortured and
can you believe anything that a tortured
person says no no we can't believe
anything a tortured person says does
that mean it's not true well it feels
true if I had to gas you know if I had
to bet and my life depended on it I'd
best I'd bet it was ukrainians but
um
6040 I'll give it a
6040 oh I'm sorry let me correct here
pesta is in charge of rebuilding Ukraine
I got my scams mixed up I'm sorry
totally wrong correct everything I said
yeah the UK the Ukraine rebuilding is
the is the equally bigger scam is equal
or bigger scam yeah so somebody's in
charge of giving away all the freebies
for climate change and somebody's in
charge of rebuilding Ukraine with all
that money
those are the ones that are the scami
EST Rico looking possibilities so yeah
uh so I stand corrected podesta is doing
the other thing that looks exactly like
a
scam well Iran allegedly according to
the Jerusalem Post and of course nothing
is believable in a fog of War situation
but the report is that Iran is told the
United States that they won't retaliate
for the US killing one of their senior
generals or commanders in Damascus and
they said they won't retaliate if
there's a ceasefire in
Gaza now if you didn't know anything
about anything and you read that would
you think that was
real like if you just didn't know how
the world works or anything would you
read that and think huh that looks
productive I'm glad Iran is finally on
the side of you know making things
better they want to see ceasefire
they're thinking about their little
buddies in Gaza wow nice
people good good people well I think it
might be closer to say it's just a fun
thing for them to say in
public just a fun thing because I think
that they know there won't be any kind
of a Gaza you know ceasefire and
exchange of prisoners I don't think
there's any chance of that but it puts
pressure on Israel so it's just more
pressure on Israel so it's a clever
persuasion thing to say but um no that's
not why they're holding back on their
attack if they're holding back on an
attack it's only because they know that
making the attack would make things
worse that's it that's the only reason
they would hold back they're not holding
back to help negotiate
Gaza that's not happening it's just
something they can say to maybe Stave
off an attack a little longer something
just
persuasion meanwhile uh Pete Buddha
judge gaslighting the nation he said in
a recent uh show um that uh people don't
talk enough about how uh quote I can
safely walk my dog to the capital today
in a way that you couldn't do when we
all got
here so according to Buddha judge DC has
gone from an unsafe place to a safe
place and he can walk his dog uh with
his full contingent of Secret Service I
guess I don't know can he really walk
his dog
alone does anybody believe that P Buddha
jedge can walk his dog just by himself
and his dog in Washington
DC like that wouldn't be safe even
without
crime depending on the dog too they
might try to steal his dog anyway
um and then but last year I gu DC had
the not exactly its safest year so does
anybody believe that DC got
safer and and then and there was a a
news article today that I I couldn't
even read it was so stupid that said
that uh San Francisco is one of the
safest uh
cities or the highest quality of life or
something like all of the news is fake
now like every every news about life
style or was cities doing well here's
what you're going to see you're going to
see a whole bunch of fake blue cities
are doing great
stories especially California because
you know Nome might be the uh relief
pitcher oh yeah and let me tell you how
oh I actually I actually saw a post
today from somebody who said that Los
Angeles is the best place to live he's
he's lived
everywhere but he wrote a very long
thread to tell tell you that of all the
places he's lived Los Angeles is
actually the best place to raise a
family um and it's best for you
environmental reasons and just a whole
bunch of reasons they got the culture
the restaurants the the beaches the
mountains now it could be that was just
one person's honest
opinion but reality is what
predicts I
predict that you will see a whole bunch
of stories about blue cities looking
great and climate change is worse than
ever and uh about the the poor woman who
tried to get an abortion but couldn't
because her State didn't allow it and
she died trying to get across state
lines and you're going to hear all those
stories none of them are going to be
real they're all going to be Democrats
controlling the media just
positioning
yep
[Music]
um all right so ladies and gentlemen
this comes to the conclusion of my
prepared remarks I'm going to talk to
the locals people
privately um if you're not subscribing
to the Dilbert comic then you don't know
that today is Dilbert reborn available
only to subscribers here on the
xplatform but also on
locals uh is the naughtiest Dilbert
comic of all
time would you like to know what it is
I'll give you a hint
dillbert invents some VR
glasses and an app so it's an app that
use you with your VR glasses to make
people look naked so it removes their
clothes now that's based on a real thing
there really is I think there was and
will be apps that remove people's
clothes so he hands it to Alice and says
hey you know my app can remove people's
clothes and before Alice puts it on she
says well that's ridiculous how could
the app know what you look like without
pants how could it know and then she
puts it on and you see from the building
some
dialogue in which dilber says it's based
on shoe
size now I don't know if you know this
this is a little inside
cartooning cartoon characters always
have extra large
feet yeah like dilber has unusual really
large
feet so you'd have to sort of know that
you know it's funnier if you know that
cartoon characters have big feet
basically and then Alice puts on the
glasses and she shrieks and she goes
watch out there's an anaconda
in
O and that's a joke you'll never see in
a
newspaper the Anaconda in your pants
because your feet are so large because
of VR pulling it all together that's
called pulling it all together so to
speak all right ladies and gentlemen I'm
going to go talk to the locals people
I'll see you back here tomorrow thanks
for
joining uh and we'll bring the fun again
tomorrow bye for
now local supporters
only
e
e
e
e
e
for
