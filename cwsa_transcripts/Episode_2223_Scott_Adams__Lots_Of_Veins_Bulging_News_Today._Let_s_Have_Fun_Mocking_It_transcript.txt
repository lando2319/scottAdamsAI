foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and if
you're new here well it's the beginning
of the best part of your life because we
take it up to levels that nobody's ever
dreamed of you can't get this on
CNN
um and if you want to join us in this
marvelous experience this morning all
you need is a cup of mug or glass a
tanker Chalice of Stein a canteen jungle
falaska vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid I like coffee and
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure it's a dope of being the end of
the day the thing that makes everything
better it's called the simultaneous sip
go
ah very good very good
some of our best I think
well let's talk about the most important
news
I like to do it from the most important
to the least so we had all the the big
stuff right up front
um Tucker Carlson is going to interview
a guy who says he had sex with Obama
so
so that's big news
big news big news
now here's my take on it
I would not believe it
short of physical evidence such as uh oh
yes let's say oral sex not so somebody
wants me to clarify
that there was no penetration
alleged that it was only oral okay good
good addition
um but my my take is that I don't
believe a story of this nature
because it's in a category of stories
that are sketchy by the nature
um
but a lot of you are saying but Scott
the evidence is overwhelming
because there are people who know this
guy
and even I think Tracy beans or somebody
said she knows him well totally not
lying
and then I guess he passed a lie
detector somebody said I don't know if
that's true but they say you pass the
lie detector more than once I don't know
if any that's true
so is that good people who know him
personally say he's definitely not lying
the lie detector allegedly
I don't even know if you took one but
allegedly that worked is that good
enough
no it's not even close to good enough
no no by the way I'm not saying it
didn't happen
I'm saying if you want to convince me it
happened you're going to need more than
an old Junkie
to say it happened
so someone somebody on Twitter said what
I've been thinking is
is there any possibility he thinks that
happened and it didn't
yes there is yes there is
do you know what the accuracy rate is of
eyewitness accounts of crimes you know
this obviously is not a well I guess
it's a crime if drugs were involved but
if you if you get eyewitnesses
to say you know who did you see right
standing right in front of you
they have something like a 50 Miss rate
I had this experience when I worked at a
bank the bank got robbed and I described
the person who robbed me
not even close
in fact when the FBI called me into
their secret facility and they played
back the video from the security cameras
to show the guy robbing me
they showed the guy standing in front of
me and they go is this the guy that
robbed you I'm like no you kidding me
that's not even close no the guy who
robbed me was you know and I described a
totally different guy 30 years of
different age different hair color
different height and different clothing
and they said really this is not the guy
who robbed you I said he was standing
right in front of me
yeah he was this far away
I was looking right at him while he
robbed me it was a rainy chance that I
got that wrong
and then they said watch this
and they they have like a hand crank
where they could change the speed of the
video
and and I watched this guy rob me
and I was there like
what I have a perfect memory of a
different person
which I still do I said now I have a
memory of what I saw in the video but at
the same time I have a perfect memory of
a completely different guy robbing me
now I was robbed twice
one time I was asked to pick the robber
out of a lineup and it was easy he was
the only one smiling but I also
recognized him
as did all the other people because he
robbed a number of banks so everybody
who was in the witness group we all
recognized him right away
but the guy that I described completely
differently
was also described the same way I
described him by another witness in the
bank
we both described a completely different
guy but here's the weird part our two
independent descriptions we didn't
compare notes we were talked to
separately were the same not guy he
wasn't there we both saw somebody who
wasn't there
two for two there were only two
witnesses and we both saw somebody who
absolutely was not the person who robbed
me
now if you say to yourself he passed the
lie detector and the people who know him
personally are positive he's not lying
what are the odds is true
it's about 50 percent
roughly 50 percent
yeah and I don't think he's necessarily
lying
so that's not my theory I think he may
have had a memory of something that
didn't happen
do you think that there's ever been a
well it wasn't there something about
uh Obama got out of the limo wasn't part
of the story
like there was a limo involved
uh
I remember a story uh in my own life
of somebody who was a limo driver and uh
pulled up to give somebody a ride and
this person had a gay roommate
she wasn't gay but a roommate you know
just had a gay roommate and the gay
roommate ended up
having a quick affair with the driver
I don't know if it was while they waited
for the ride or yeah or afterwards but
is there any chance it was the driver
you know I'm not I'm not saying that's
the explanation I'm just saying that we
live in a weird world where a eyewitness
report just doesn't mean what you think
it is it's maybe a 50 chance of being
true
anyway I don't care if it's true or not
you know you you could make an argument
it's like oh because of this or that
it's important not really is it maybe
it's only important in the narrow sense
that it tells you how easily you could
be duped about something ordinary but it
doesn't doesn't matter beyond that
all right uh as you know the ADL
the Anti-Defamation League which is
really a more of a defamation producer
than a defamation thwarter but that's my
opinion
so I looked at their the ADL myths and
facts page myths and facts I wanted to
see if there's anything that people have
been saying about them that was unfair
and if and if I had said any unfair
things I wanted to see what their
argument was because I figure people
probably say similar things
so in my mind I was thinking all right
how long would I have to read their fact
page where they're debunking the myths
about them before I spot one that's
obviously
here's the first one two three four
um here's the first four words the first
four words of the page after the title
ADL myths and facts and I quote as a
non-partisan organization
foreign
that they're literally most famous for
being a partisan wing of the Democrats
that they use just as a attack dog to go
after Republicans now that doesn't mean
they don't also do good work they
probably do
because there's probably a bunch of
defamation out there that needs to be
you know rebuked
but they are most famous for being a
highly partisan organization and on
their myth page they they actually have
the the guts to
put the first four words as a
nonpartisan organization everything
after that you can disbelieve
you know the Judge Jeanine
thing uh and she didn't make it up but
she says it often that if yeah that the
judge might instruct the jury that if
the witness lies about anything and you
know it's lie or you're you're sure it's
a lie uh that you're you certainly are
within your right to assume that
everything said after that is sketchy
there you go
all right one of the most puzzling uh
questions in my mind about the
brainwashing that half of the country
has experienced is how they think the
January 6 fake elector scheme would have
played out if it had gone a different
direction
so the the so-called alternate electors
that Trump and some folks wanted uh that
didn't work out
uh now the Democrats would call them
fake electors
the people who were in favor of this
plan would have called them alternate
electors and they would have said
there's some precedent Hawaii blah blah
blah
um
but on the left
they believe that this is obviously this
was an Insurrection coup kind of a thing
because if Trump had gotten away with
putting in some what they'd call fake
electors
well then he'd be president and you know
that would be
opposite of what the election outcome
was and so that would be a coup
so uh jenk uyghur
um
he he was mocking Trump supporters and
he said this today the Tweet he said who
made Trump organize in all capitals fake
electors to replace the actual electors
he did that because he aged losing and
he's an idiot who thought he could do a
coup
against America
it's against America uh when are
Republicans going to stop their endless
crying about how they are special
 victims
to which I replied
now the reason that I like replying to
jenk
is
he's not completely lost
meaning he does have the facility
to adjust his opinions based on actual
data but I don't think he gets the same
data that you and I do
um yeah I just don't think he gets I
don't think he sees the same things we
do so I'm trying to help him out
trying to help him out so I responded
and I said uh game without Jank
I said let's say those alternate or or
fake electors one forward
what happens next
what would happen next
um would everyone say oh okay good play
Trump you got us you got us we did not
see the fake elector play
but as soon as you said we're going to
ignore the election and just put in fake
electors well you became president again
and what are you going to do what are
you going to do
good play was that going to happen
probably not right the odds got to lower
that or how about this uh an armed Civil
War
as soon as those fake electors were
approved armed Civil War right everybody
gets their gun and says oh fake electors
fake electors well except the problem
would be
it would be the unarmed part of the
public that wouldn't like the outcome
the people with all the guns would be
the ones that are like oh those fake
collectors are pretty good electors if
you ask me I like the fake ones they're
good
I call them alternates
right was that going to happen I don't
think so
I don't think so it didn't look like we
were on the I saw no signs that we were
on a border of like an actual you know
General Civil War or something like that
no no signs at all
or is it more likely or is the third
possibility
that the the state collectors went
forward and let's say they chose Trump
based on that process what would happen
next
do you think it would go to the Supreme
Court
like Gore versus bush
of course it would
and what would happen if the Supreme
Court
saw that somebody was picking fake
electors and didn't have a good argument
for it or or they picked fake collectors
because they thought the elected needed
some extra attacking what is the Supreme
Court even though it's conservative
um majority what would it do
well it would either say oh those fake
collectors are no good
or
it would say the election was no good
and so therefore fake electors make
sense do you think that the Supreme
Court without any evidence of an
election being bad nothing that we've
seen that seems credible
or or nothing that a court has said is
true do you think that they were going
to say oh that election was bad they
didn't have any evidence of that
right
no the most likely outcome
two outcomes is they'd either say know
these alternates are inappropriate you
have to go with the you know the ones
that were picked or
they would have said they are legitimate
and if the Supreme Court says they are
legitimate the alternates
then Trump is the president
that's how it works that's the system
that's how it is designed and that's how
it's supposed to work now was everybody
happy when the Supreme Court ruled in a
way that made Bush president instead of
Gore
no they were not
people were not happy
but we went on
and we didn't we didn't call it a coup
did we
probably probably somebody called oku
but we didn't you know sort of generally
say the country was taken over we said
we had an ugly process it was really
close and it's a good thing we have a
supreme court because then we can all go
back to our lives and stop thinking
about this
yeah maybe maybe Bush did win but there
was still plenty of room for challenging
you know Gore could have carried it
further he just decided not to
so that's my uh my challenge to jenk is
to tell me how he thinks it would have
played out
because I think it would have been fine
all right uh
it looks like Alex Jones is going to be
right again as people keep telling me
that the TSA definitely is planning to
bring back masks and maybe probably
planning to bring back the entire must
be vaccinated protocol by the winter
um and so JD Vance
is uh promoting some legislation to make
that illegal no more mass mandates for
school for school kids or airline
passengers now that's just the first
things that came up obviously there
might be other things later
now I don't know if that'll get passed
probably not because there are lots of
people in Congress
um but here's what I say
if the airlines require masks it won't
be because the airlines asked for it
right because the TSA required it and
give me a fact check on that that's true
right it wouldn't be the airlines making
the decision they would just be
complying with oh the FAA
so it'd be the FAA somebody's saying all
right but in any case it would be the
government it would not be the airlines
right
we should still as a public destroy the
airlines
put them out of business just bankrupt
them totally
do I care that the government made them
do it
nope nope would it be terribly unfair to
the airlines oh yeah terribly unfair
would it be like super unfair to the
employees who might lose their jobs
absolutely unfair unfair like crazy do
it anyway do it anyway because you can't
you can't give away your freedom for
nothing
it's going to be expensive
if you want to take our freedom it's
going to cost and if we have to destroy
an entire industry
to regain our freedom I'm totally in
favor of that no no hesitation
whatsoever take out the entire airline
industry and by the way the airline
industry is a mess
if there if there's one thing that we
should get rid of entirely and start
over
it's the airline industry
does anybody disagree airlines are the
only thing I know that has gotten worse
every year for my entire life
for my entire life Airline flying has
gotten a little bit worse every time
we don't need that we should just wipe
it off the map bankrupt all those
companies and see if somebody can build
something that makes sense and works
yeah so
um yes I'm in favor of JD Vance's
legislation but if that doesn't get it
done we have to bankrupt the first
company that you know goes forward and
if it's all of them you have to get them
all take out the entire industry
all right let's talk about those Florida
Nazis
led by boneface is that his name bone
face
and he's got some weird CIA connections
that he fought in Ukraine which is weird
he fought with the Ukrainian Nazis which
is weird and
but yeah he is he's also strangely
articulate
for for being the person that he is uh
which is weird
but uh the worst thing about this story
by far
is Joe Biden calling them fine people
can you believe that Joe Biden the
president of the United States
stood in front of the world and called
these Nazis
you know with actual Nazi flags and if
you didn't notice their veins were
bulging
did you see the Volga the bulging veins
that was the worst part
and then he goes up there and he goes
these Nazis are fine people and I'm like
what
what does he really say that like I
couldn't believe it when I heard it now
some people are going to say that didn't
happen but I heard it with my own ears
so it must have happened right
moving on
uh I wanted to track the evolution of a
Biden supporter
and yes I'm going to keep saying that by
the way
I'm going to keep saying that Biden
called those Nazis fine people I'm going
to tweet it
I'm going to say it every day
until somebody says what the hell are
you talking about
and maybe we'll have a conversation
about how these things happen
but if we don't
Joe Biden called the Nazis fine people
and I think all of you should repeat
that
you should all repeat it
until you're deeply challenged about the
the factual uh value of it
make sure you just oh every time you see
a Democrat and say well you know he
called them fine people
Biden did and it's hard to explain
yeah
all right so here's the evolution of a
Biden supporter 2016.
Trump is a liar
right that's all Democrats in 2016.
Trump he's a liar we need an honest
person as president he's a liar lying
liar so many lies
2020
Biden has replaced the liar yay we got
rid of the liar we got Biden in there
instead of the liar yay 2020.
2022
well at least Biden doesn't lie as much
as Trump
he doesn't lie as much
right so we're way better off because we
got a guy who doesn't lie as much
that was 20 22. 2023 all right maybe
maybe the substance of Biden's lives are
far worse he did start to find people
hoax which is the worst hoax ever played
in the country
yeah that I mean that's pretty bad and
he did do the laptop hoax and the whole
cover-up of his ukrainian's involvement
and those are well maybe even the cause
of a World War we don't know yet but
those are the worst lies I've ever seen
in the political world
but
look how many times Trump has lied about
his crowd size
I mean how do you compare those sure
Biden had the worst lies but there
weren't that many of them
you repeated him a lot but not that many
just just that he was involved with
something improper in Ukraine which may
or may not be a reason for us spending
all our money and having a war over
there that will kill a million people
maybe don't know
but uh and then we got 2024.
I'm looking ahead to the next Evolution
and it will be all right maybe Biden is
brain dead now but but at least he still
he lies less than Trump
right yes his brain is not working and
he can't speak he's in a vegetative
state
but let's compare Who Lies more huh he's
laying there unable to talk he's hooked
up to machines but do you see any line
no
the most honest president we've ever had
compare that to Trump once again he said
his crowd size was twice as big as it
was and I don't think we can live with
that
you know what I mean can't live with
that
all right
speaking of jenk
[Music]
I had one other interaction with him
ah
so Jack was making fun of
Trump's boxes you know his boxes of
Secrets
um and I said I replied to him because
he thought the boxes of secrets were a
reason not to vote for Trump
and I said if Trump had nuclear secrets
or UFO Secrets or Russia secrets we
would already know the the general
domain let me go back first I said
if the boxes had anything that mattered
we would already know what's in them
right
so my statement is if the Mar-A-Lago
boxes had things that were really
dangerous for the country
of course that would have been leaked
we would know
something about that by now so here's
what jenk says to that comment see if
this looks I'm going to call this
section
um
stupid
or just being partisan stupid or
partisan
so in response to my comment that we
would know what was in the boxes if it
was really a problem
Jank retweets me and he says
uh
why is my page not working oh he said of
my response she goes this is the most
nonsensical response I can imagine
that they're so important that they were
classified as top secret and he says you
don't know what's in them precisely
because they're so important to National
Security
now
did Jack
interpret my comment
to mean that I thought we should know
the details of those secrets
because he was responding as if he
thought
I had suggested that we would know the
details of the sequence of the Boxes by
now
the top secret boxes
and he actually was I guess he was
certain enough that that's what I meant
that he wanted to mock me in public for
it
do you think that's what I meant
would any of you interpret
that we know what's in the boxes to mean
that we would know the details of what's
in the boxes
now is that is that TDS or is he just
being partisan he knows what he's doing
does he know what he's doing or not
I don't know uh he's not going to
respond to this I said
if Trump had nuclear secrets or UFO
Secrets or Russia secrets we would
already know the general domain of the
secrets do you agree
we would know the general domain of
those secrets for sure if they were
really critical and important they don't
need to tell us what exactly he had but
if they say it was something about how
to you know nuclear well that would
narrow it down and not be concerned
about that
but we haven't heard that which strongly
suggests there's nothing in those boxes
of actual importance
all right uh I was trying to think of
all the things that Democrats have given
us and I noticed a pattern
so I just wrote them down and see if you
can find any pattern I haven't
identified the pattern yet but I think
there's one here see if you can find it
the Democrats have given us the the ADL
to destroy free speech
the teachers unions to destroy education
they've given us no bail and fewer pleas
to destroy retail
business and cities
they've given us climate alarm to
destroy our energy sector they've given
us activists to destroy our domestic
nuclear energy future they've given us
bad judges the January 6 outcomes to
destroy the credibility of our Judicial
System they've given us fake news to
destroy patriotism and replace it with
division and they have given us pandemic
mandates to destroy our mental health
and the future of our children
they've also got the Ukraine war to
destroy whatever's left over
and some people added a few they said
you know they give us Tick Tock to
destroy human reproduction
by making everybody
change genders I guess and they've also
given us windmills to destroy whales and
Rob Reiner on the beach
so you have to you have to respect the
thoroughness of it
and I thought this is a pretty strong
approach
yeah it's a pretty strong approach to
say that the um somebody like Vivek for
example he's looking to build something
and as is Trump so the Republicans are
looking to make something
and the Democrats have this long history
of putting in place systems and you know
organizations that seem
intent on destroying something good in
each case
that they use the border security to
destroy border security
that's like a real thing that's not even
hyperbole they're using border security
to eliminate border security
now do you think that the Democrats are
aware
that the way they did that is just to
make all the illegal immigrants legal if
they come in through the you know the
front door if you're coming through the
front door and you just say ah I'm a
Asylum Asylum Seeker we're not allowed
to question it
we give them documents and say Enjoy
your time in the country seven years
later we may or may not contact them to
for a court date
and in seven years if there's a democrat
in charge
probably instead of being
evicted they're going to say what have
you been doing for 70 years and the
answer will be I've been working
paying taxes
and then the Democrats say well it'll be
kind of unfair to kick you in at this
point
and it wouldn't be it would be
uh in my opinion
so that is literally the elimination of
border security
it's amazing to me
that the polling for the 2024
presidential election is close
now and I know that I know that
Democrats say the same thing
they say well how can it be close when
Trump's been indicted so many times they
they still don't get the indictment
thing
do you feel like they don't get it yet
I also saw a number of Democrats say
they were happy that the January 6
people got these insanely long
um
jail sentences 22 years for one who
wasn't even there
wasn't even there the guy who got 17
years away shaking a fence or breaking a
window or something
now the Democrats seem to think those
are reasonable have you heard even one
Democrat even one
say hey that's too far
could you imagine if if AOC came out and
said that's too far
you know that these sentences are
ridiculous you've made a mockery of our
judicial system
she won't
but it would break the world if she did
I haven't heard RFK Jr talk about it yet
have you what is RFK Jr saying there's
no way he's in favor of that
maybe just staying quiet about
that would probably be the best play
um but it's it's an amazing situation
so that's the way if I were running for
president I would frame it as the things
that they're destroying versus the
things you're building and I think a lot
of that is the goals versus systems
problem
the the Democrats have a goal and then
they the goal makes them just do the
thing our goal is not to be mean at the
border
well if you're immediately trying to
stop being mean you end up just letting
everybody in
so their their goal-oriented approach to
everything is giving them exactly what
you'd expect would be the result
all right
um
one of the most embarrassing things the
Democrats have done
to themselves
is to make me the best predictor of all
time
for my prediction in 2020 on July 1st
that Republicans would be hunted if
Biden got elected
I I leave it to the audience true or
false
that Biden got elected and Republicans
are being hunted
100 true
I was never more mocked for for any
prediction than that one but you can see
it well I can see it I can see it was
forming because the way they felt about
Republicans suggested
some form of violence
and the form that they're choosing is
the legal system because they have
enough judges that they can just
put put Republicans in jail basically as
long as they want
so yes Republicans are in fact being
hunted and uh thank you democrats for
making that a
making me the best predictor of all time
uh people have been telling me they
haven't been seeing any anti-Semitism
and I keep saying but I see tons of it
and I realized that people don't know
what it looks like
so if you haven't seen it
this is what it looks like
I say anything about something going
wrong in the country
and that then one of the anti all right
let's see if I can keep the connection
working for
like a minute
so the people who come into my comments
and say who are they who are they are
the anti-semites and what they're trying
to say is that uh that there's a Jewish
Conspiracy to Rule the World and
something like that
and
uh
yeah and the comments are going wild
with anti-Semitism right now over on
YouTube YouTube's just a toilet
um but if you don't recognize it that's
what it is
right so it's not the only way to
recognize it but it's it's one way
uh yeah I'm just looking at your
comments to be so I could be horrified
for a minute
yeah
so but the the problem with that they
people have is they can't explain
how you wouldn't get exactly what we
observed in the world today
just by knowing that Jews like to get
good educations
that explains everything you see
you don't need a worldwide
conspiracy
that for some reason I've lived my
entire life I've never seen any hidden
stuff
you know I'm completely immersed or have
been until recently in
successful Jewish leaders and
Publications and every Realm
you know just completely all the time I
mean you can't you can't be operating at
a high level in business unless you're
running into successful Jewish people
everywhere
I've never heard anybody
even a whiff of anything that's like
some big conspiracy
it's just a bunch of people looking out
for their own interests like everybody
now I'm I'm pretty finely tuned for
conspiracies
and even racism you know I feel like I
see it even when I don't see it but I
was a Yeti like decades and decades
being immersed in that world I've never
seen anything
and if you if you've not been immersed
in that world you probably your opinions
are a little under-informed
so just ask yourself this if you're one
of those who's they Scott if you're one
of those people just ask yourself how it
would look if the only explanation for
all of it is a high interest in
education
and high achievement in education you
get the same look we have now it'll look
exactly like what we have now
all right
uh Rob Ryder seemed unusual happy
unusually happy about the j6ers and
their long sentences
um
and you know he actually tweeted about
it and I thought to myself they're so
they're so broken that if they can't get
Trump
they would be happy to jail forever
somebody who supported him
and and it's very obvious
the Democrats are actually happy
that the January 6 people are getting uh
sentences that nobody thinks are
realistic in in terms of being
appropriate to the crimes nobody
and they're and they're delighted
so when I say that Republicans will be
hunted
hunted suggests Recreation doesn't it
right Hunters are doing it not just for
the food sometimes of the food but
recreationally when I see Rob Reiner
tweet about this
it looks like he enjoyed it
it looks like you got some pleasure
watching Republicans be put in jail for
uh what are clearly
you know inappropriate sentences
so that's haunted
haunted means recreational
there it is
all right here's something I hoped I
would see but
uh I did get to see it finally
so you know Dr Peter McCullough
would you say he is one of the doctors
who has been anti vaccination
and also maybe a uh let's see what would
you say a a rogue rogue doctor
you know it doesn't go along with the
mainstream
but I've had my own criticisms of Dr
McCullough
because even if it turns out he's right
about everything which is possible I
wouldn't rule that out you might be
right about everything
but his understanding of uh studies and
statistics look to me
like that wasn't his field
and I tried I tried criticizing just his
understanding of some studies and data
in the past and I got slapped down so
hard
that I just said all right I'm out it
just isn't worth it because people want
to believe him
and therefore it doesn't matter what the
you know analysis is
so then I saw this tweet so Dr
McCullough had this tweet he said
there are some new evidence that heavily
vaccinated have the highest all-cause
mortality
and if you're unvaccinated you would
have the least all-cause mortality
so what about that
I mean that's pretty conclusive isn't it
would you say that's kind of conclusive
let's say the data is true
let's say the data is true and the most
heavily vaccinated also are the ones
dying the most
for a variety of reasons variety of
reasons they're dying the most
that's uh that is strong evidence that
the vaccinations are bad for you right
that's what that's what Dr McCall is
saying
how is that wrong
if the people were most vaccinated have
the worst medical outcomes for all
causes
isn't that proof are you completely sold
why not what's wrong with it what's
wrong with that analysis
well let's see what Dr Jordan Peterson
says that about that analysis quite
politely
now if you don't know Dr Jordan Peterson
he knows what his study is he knows how
to interpret that
he knows when he sees it
and he's generally one of the smartest
people in the public conversation
scientifically as well as socially and
culturally
and Dr Jordan Peterson saw that tweet
and he said very polite politely an
objection parenthetically even though I
don't trust the vax companies a bit
he says how do you know that those who
are more generally unhealthy weren't
more likely to take the vaccine because
of their health concern
vaccinated for us unvaccinated all-cause
mortality is only a valid stat when s uh
assignation to group was random is it
not
do you see how politely he approached us
because Dr Jordan Peterson knows as I
know and as you know that if anyone who
were to disagree with Dr McCullough
they would be slapped so hard for just
disagreeing with his statement
because I know I was yeah so he's
putting in the form of a question but
it's not a question this
is it a question
it's not exactly a question is it it's
sort of a question statement
which is this is
this is absolute unmitigated
unhealthy people get the most
vaccinations
and they're most likely to die from
those other unhealthy things the whole
reason that they're the most vaccinated
is because they're most likely to die
from
say it the reason they're highly
vaccinated is they're most likely to die
from
all cause mortality
exactly exactly what the study is all
cause mortality so the people who have
all core all cause
comorbidities
strangely enough or also the most likely
to die
I mean who saw that coming
now
two years ago when I was saying to you
all right I'm no doctor
but I'm pretty sure that Dr McCullough
is not kind of understanding studies
and boy did I get my ass handed to me
Scott you're no doctor
who knows how to look at a medical study
better than you know do you think do you
think the doctor knows or the cartoonist
yeah
so for two years I had to put up
with idiots telling me that I could not
tell that Dr McCullough
may have made a slight
analytical error in the data
but Jordan Peterson took a run at him
so I'll let Peterson take this from here
on
you know godspeed Dr Peterson
good luck
I wouldn't touch it
all right
ladies and gentlemen
we're coming to the conclusion of what I
would consider
let's see what the dumb people say shall
I read the dumbest comments
I'm going to pick this one out because
it's in all capitals this is on YouTube
well I don't get comments like this on
locals that the dumb people are all on
YouTube all right Richard says this uh
Richard uh we can call him dick
in all caps so I'm gonna I'm gonna say
it like all caps who would deliver you a
claw shot without caring what would
happen to you
okay that's not even a sentence
but I'm sure you're very passionate
about those random words that you put in
all caps okay
uh here's Mike cope cope
good one Mike because my insightful
analysis
which you agree with
the best way to summarize that is cope
or
cope
all right let's see some more
um
McCullough was talking about a
controlled trial
a controlled trial
controlled in what way
by comorbidity
uh
Scott
that's a different topic
signals require further evaluation
McCullough is simply highlighting a
signal
is that a signal
is it a signal to see exactly what you
expect to see
there almost couldn't be any other way
well it makes that a signal
human beings sometimes die well it's a
signal that somebody's killing us
no we sort of die on our own
there's no real signal there
all right
um
you don't expect the outcome in working
age people yes I do
working age people with comorbidities I
do expect
to die more often than people who don't
have comorbidities I do I mean that's on
me but I do
um
all right what else
what evidence would I need to try an
all-meat diet oh I'm glad you brought
that up I I have a hypothesis
that I haven't done any research okay so
this is based on my own experience so
it's observational and anecdotal and not
scientific
but it goes like this so you've heard
that uh Dr Jordan Peterson had a great
health outcomes by going to an all-meat
diet you've all heard that so he had
terrible some number of I don't know
maybe unspecified kinds of problems
meaning I don't know if they had a name
but once he went on an all-meat diet
they completely resolved
now you've heard other people
who have gone the other way have you not
have you not heard of people who had
problems and then they decided I'm just
going to eat vegetables you know your
whole whole foods and vegetables and
they'll report oh all my problems were
solved
have you ever heard of that
I've heard of that you've not heard of
that you've not heard of anybody who
resolved their who resolved their health
problems by moving to a primary
primarily vegetarian diet you've never
seen that in the news
seriously that's like one of the most
common news stories of all time you
don't see it as much but it used to be
one of the most common ones
right now I'm not I'm not promoting
either diet so before you get mad at me
I'm not telling you what to eat nothing
like that's happening
right I think I'm a vegetarian well
pescetarian
I'm a grudgingly I'll leave fish I don't
like it but I feel like I need it
um
so I'm not telling you not to eat meat
I'm not telling you to eat meat I'm not
telling you to eat vegetables I'm not
telling you not to eat vegetables
nothing like that so get that in your
head we're just going to look at the
facts here's my hypothesis
that you will get healthier if you eat
only meat
but also if you eat only vegetables
and no meat
you'd probably have to supplement in
that case you know but let's say let's
say you do it right you supplement a few
things so you got enough protein
here here's why I say that in both cases
it's about what you don't eat
in both cases the magic is that you're
not eating processed foods in either
case
no sauces no preservatives no processed
foods
so in my personal experimentation when I
go a day or two without processed foods
which is really hard
I feel great
but if I eat let's say just restaurant
food or stuff that comes in the package
or heat it up in a can or something like
that I feel terrible
and I don't know what's the cause I like
just sort of an all-body
things aren't working and I feel like I
have allergies I feel like I have
inflammation a little bit you know I
feel like I'm tired
like all of it like just a general
malaise
and one of the reasons that I've lost so
much weight lately
there's a few different reasons but I
wasn't really trying
I just stopped eating processed foods
because I was sort of experimenting and
I thought I would you know maybe
you know get my way to exactly where I
wanted it which is I have right now I'm
not at my exact weight I want
um
but it does seem to me that Dr Peterson
is on to something with a meat diet but
mostly because what he doesn't eat
and that's why I think the the people
who go all veggie have you ever seen
somebody who did a real Clean Diet
I had a friend once who was the cleanest
eater I've ever seen I mean just crazy
clean wouldn't even use regular
toothpaste you know there was just a
whole bunch of normal products that she
wouldn't use at all
I've never seen a healthier person
and I don't know if you know I don't
know if it's cause or effect it's just
anecdotal but when I see people who are
really serious about avoiding processed
foods
they almost always look way healthier
than other people but they're probably
also doing everything else because they
care so much about their health so you
can't really get a clean read on whether
it's that one one variable but it is
something like somebody said it's a
signal it's something that goes maybe I
should look into that how many of you
think I'm on to something and by the way
I don't think I invented this idea
you're going to tell me somebody else is
already onto this because it's a little
bit obvious but wouldn't you say that
both diets are probably better than a
normal American diet
like in in the way that makes you feel
good the same day
yeah and and sugar is poison for sure
uh I'm gonna I'm gonna do a little favor
to those of you who are not familiar to
my work
is there anybody on YouTube I know all
the people in the locals platform have
heard this before but on the YouTube
platform is there anybody who hasn't
heard my diet system
it's in my book had it failed almost
everything and still wouldn't be
I'm going to give you just a little bit
of it right there's there's a few parts
of it
goes like this the first thing you do is
you replace willpower which is not real
anyway with
um knowledge
because if you're using willpower to
resist eating the bad foods you'll
eventually break down everybody has a
bad day so willpower as a mechanism to
try really hard that doesn't work
doesn't work instead
you want to make sure that you get the
same amount of dopamine
with the diet you're leaving
as with a diet you're going to
so if you use knowledge you can figure
out how to prepare foods that are not
your normal foods but are you know
organic and good for you and you can
make them taste delicious
for example
watermelon
isn't too bad for you right am I right
about that watermelon is okay for you
you're not going to get fat or sick from
a watermelon right did you know try this
at home but by the way this will sell
the whole my entire concept would be
sold the moment you try this
take some watermelon chunks
put lime juice on them you know really
slop them with lime juice and then put
salt
on top of them I like a lot of salt but
you know salt to taste if you eat a
piece of watermelon that you already
thought was pretty darn good
and you put lime juice on it it's even
better if you use a real lime squeeze it
on and salt
you'll eat it like it's dessert
your brain will go what
uh nobody told me about this
and you'll be almost angry
that nobody told you watermelon could
taste that good
I I eat like a you know bowl of
watermelon almost every day yeah if I
have it in the house because I can't
stop eating it
and what do what am I doing while I'm
eating that watermelon I'm not eating
processed foods
right it's about what I'm not eating
that's the secret
right now
take the watermelon trick and then
multiply it by every food
there's a way to make broccoli that
you'll love
same with most of the vegetables there's
10 ways to hate them
and there's going to be at least one way
you're like what here's the weirdest one
try this one at home
uh have you ever eaten a piece of
cauliflower
with you know just some salt or
something
it's not very good is it take a little
clump of cauliflower just put a little
salt on it and go
you'd be like
no thank you I will not do this again
but take that exact same piece of
cauliflower
slice it with a sharp knife so it's
really fine little uh fine little slices
and then put some salt and pepper on
your cutting board not not on the food
on The Cutting Board and take your flat
little piece that you've cut from the
cauliflower and push it down into the
salt and pepper and rub it around
and then eat that little piece
it's like the best thing you ever had in
your mouth
it goes from completely terrible
to oh my God I could eat this whole
entire head of cauliflower if I do it
this way
now for almost everything that you eat
there's going to be one of those if you
would if you had enough knowledge right
here's where knowledge replaces
willpower if you have the knowledge
to make your watermelon and your
cauliflower taste amazing
how hard would it be to avoid the other
thing that tastes good but isn't good
for you
same amount of dopamine
if you if you use your diet if you think
of your diet plan as a dopamine
management system then you get all the
right answers
because if you can get as much dopamine
from the stuff that's good for you which
requires knowledge knowledge not
willpower just knowledge you have to
experiment until you find what makes it
like really Delight you
so once you've replaced willpower with
knowledge you're about a third of the
way
to losing weight without any effort at
all no effort you're still eating
delicious things
here's the next trick and this one's
really important
if you were to say all right I'm going
to go on this diet I'm not going to eat
any of these bad foods that I love so
much
how often do people succeed at that
not not a lot right because those foods
are just so delicious and then you
usually say something like this well I'm
gonna have a cheat day
of a cheat day so that you know I'm
never I'm not I'm not completely denying
myself
so I I can't live if I deny myself
totally I'll but I'll have a cheat day
worst idea ever
you could a hundred of you could tell
tell me that that saved your life to
have a cheat day
not gonna hear it
cheat day is the worst idea of dieting
here's what you do instead
you pick one food and only one
that's on your problem list let's say
you've got a dozen things that you eat
that are all problems right like for me
it was french fries and Snickers candy
bars uh cheesecake
you know I'm not really a sweets but
there are a few that I don't know I like
the texture or something
so instead of getting rid of all those
things that you like
you pick one
you say all right
uh I'm not going to do chocolate candy
but that's the only thing I'm not going
to do
I can still eat all the watermelon I
want I can still eat all the cauliflower
I want but I can also and this is key I
can eat all those other bad foods
I'm not banned at all much as you want
the only one you can't have is the one
you picked wait two months this is the
key two months
after two months
watch what happens to that favorite food
it goes from my God I gotta put this in
my mouth like you'll actually be shaking
you wouldn't be able to hold your
favorite food in your hand near your
head and then put it down like you just
couldn't do it
but after two months your favorite food
if it's a if it's a sugar food this only
applies to Sugar basically if it's a
sugary food after two months you look at
it and say why did I like this
I I had probably 12 Diet Cokes a day for
30 years 40 years something like that
and it took two months
of being off it
to look at it as why did I put that in
my mouth
it's like chemicals in water or
something right like I don't even know
what this is
like why would I want that in my mouth
so two months to lose any craving for
any one item
then what happens after two months and
you've succeeded and get rid of getting
rid of that one item
repeat
pick the next item if you're also at the
same time working on your your knowledge
you're not losing any dopamine the
problem with diets is dopamine I can't
wait for the weekend uh I'll never lose
my addiction to Sugar I'll just have to
wait to the weekend terrible terrible
terrible
I've never known anybody who had a cheat
day who also succeeded
in the long run
people will succeed in the short run
with everything everything works in the
short run but if you have a cheat day
you're not going to get rid of your
craving a cheat day actually increases
your craving
it increases your addiction because you
want it and can't have it easily
that makes you want it more not less you
want to say I can have everything I want
I can have all the dopamine I want
I just can't have this one one thing and
I won't even notice and then you just
keep adding up the one thing
so if I take care of my worst things
then my weight just drops indefinitely
um
without effort
so I lost
10 pounds since roughly this time last
year
and I didn't put any effort into it I
just realized oh 10 pounds to everything
I want to be all I did was I stopped
eating bread
do you know how hard it was for the two
first two months
I'm not eating bread
really hard it's kind of hard but since
I could eat everything else
and I have a generally good life I had
all the dopamine I needed I didn't need
the bread to get me to my minimum level
of pleasure for the day I could reach my
minimum level of pleasure every day
without bread
but if I had nothing else going on to
give me pleasure
yeah I would I would have had the bread
because the the other Theory I have is
minimum
um yet a minimum pleasure
that all humans need a minimum amount of
pleasure dopamine in order to stay alive
you'll actually just go kill yourself if
every day you woke up and you didn't
have dopamine you'd just say all right
I'm done
so you have to find pleasure but you got
to make sure that you know it's not the
bad kind
so you got to make sure you're hitting
your pleasure your pleasure minimums or
you have no hope for a diet
in fact you have no hope for anything
if you're not hitting your minimum
pleasure for the day through healthy
beans get outside take a walk Pat your
dog you know hug your hug your mate
whatever it takes if you're not getting
enough there you absolutely 100 will get
it in an inappropriate way you can have
Reckless sex you know twice as much porn
you take drugs you shouldn't be taking
you're going to be eating food you
shouldn't be eating because you've got
to get the minimum
humans will not put up with less than
the minimum that they require of of
dopamine once you realize that we're
dopamine machines
and if you manage the dopamine
everything works
your life just changes
now I'm watching the comments as I'm
talking because I know the people on uh
locals have heard all or most of this
this is all uh familiar to you right on
locals because you've read my books and
stuff yeah I'm sure I've said it in the
live stream now let me let me check in
with the people on uh YouTube
how many of you you just said uh
uh you just reframed my entire eating
situation that sounds like it could work
yeah watch the comments Now watch how
many people can tell
yeah you can you the comments are coming
in they can tell they can tell their
lives just changed I'm not joking when I
say I changed your life just then
you'll never be the same
because the thing about a reframe is
that you only have to hear it once
if it's meaningful to you you'll never
forget it one exposure done for the rest
of your life that's just what happened
to a bunch of people there and the
comments are just scraping in right now
yeah that now if you haven't bought my
book
I was I wasn't planning to do this but
since it fits so perfectly that that's
the sort of thing uh this doesn't
concentrate on diet so much uh but my
book had failed almost everything and
still when big does it's got more
details
but this is full of reframes that are
like that one
except shorter the reason it's not here
is it takes more explaining
um
but that's how powerful reframes are and
some I could see the number of you can
feel that I just changed your entire
existence with a reframe that's how it
works
all right on that note
um I haven't heard of Brian Johnson now
should you read how to fail first
let me ask the people who've read it
okay on locals the question is
would you be better off for those of you
who have read both books would you be
better off reading how to fail first and
then reframe me brain second
I'm saying all yeses but not necessarily
so they do stand alone let me let me be
clear about that there's no necessity to
read one
to fully get the benefit of the other
but but a lot of people said that one
maybe gives you more context or
something I don't know
yeah if you want the diet stuff in
particular which you don't really need
because you just heard it then how to
fail would be the one get the second
edition
and if you just want 160 reframes in all
kinds of domains which is also about how
to fail they both have lots of different
reframes
but you'd want the reframe book if you
just want to get right to it
yeah they're different and complementary
let's say that
yeah running does the same thing for
some people
all right all right that's all for now
YouTube thanks for joining yeah I hope
that was useful to you I'll talk to you
tomorrow
