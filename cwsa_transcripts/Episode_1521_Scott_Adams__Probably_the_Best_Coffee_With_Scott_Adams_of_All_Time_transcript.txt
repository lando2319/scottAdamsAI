do
good morning everybody
and welcome to coffee with scott adams
one of the highlights of your day and
certainly mine
and
i don't know if you can feel it yet
you do you feel your
every particle in your being
start to get a little bit lighter feel a
little better things are starting to
shape up aren't they aren't they well
it's going to get even better
it's going to get even better what would
you need to do that well
amazing content that's coming up
but also the simultaneous sip and all
you need is a couple of margaret glass a
tanker chelsea steiner canteen jugger
flask
a vessel of any kind
fill it with maybe liquid i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything
better
it's called the simultaneous sip but it
happens now go
the breathless anticipation of
simultaneous swillage
well put well put in the comments there
well uh did you see the uh
the viral video of there was some school
this might be fake news by the way
but uh because it's fun
i'm gonna treat it like it's
real so i think it's fake news but maybe
maybe not
so allegedly there was some school that
banned backpacks
that's the sketchy part
was there really a school that banned
backpacks
right so first of all i don't believe
the story at all but
the story goes
that they banned backpacks and then the
kids
decided to
take advantage of the
specificity of the rule
to bring things that weren't backpacks
but could still transport books
for example one kid brought in a
one of those outdoor
trash bins
gigantic trash bin he just dragged that
into school
filled with his books another brought a
a baby stroller
i think one had a dog cage on wheels or
something now
uh i'm going to say i don't believe it's
a real story but it was pretty funny
uh if it is real let me know
uh here's a commercial failure as an
advertising commercial
intel
the company intel not the
not the intelligent services but didn't
tell the company had a commercial
and the the gist of it was they had
people come in and use their new
computer
uh or a computer with their chip in it
i'm not sure
and
the people were uh amazed and surprised
to find out that what they thought was
an excellent macintosh computer that
were an apple computer
uh was actually
a pc
and that was that was the essence of the
commercial
the people who think mcintyre or apple i
keep saying macintosh the people who
think that
the apple laptops are just the best
when they use this pc
the pc was so good that they thought it
was an apple computer
that was the commercial
how'd they do
is that the worst idea for a commercial
let me tell you what uh
teens really love
and uh
not just teens but
young adults as well you know people
really like
they like to have the cheap imitation
knockoff
of uh
of a high quality goods
i'm pretty sure the intel just told
their their customers that the good one
is an apple laptop
yeah but if they want
they could you know if they can handle
the embarrassment of not having an apple
product
they can get something that works pretty
well too
other people might not even know the
difference
so that's like the worst commercial idea
i've ever seen to tell people that their
product is almost as good as the
competition
um
well we've got a uh there's
a new uh
justice department of justice policy
in which the people are being reminded
the public is being reminded not to
get too aggressive with these school
officials
because there's lots of complaints about
everything from mass to critical race
theory
being taught in schools and i guess
parents are getting pretty aggressive
and so the justice department decided to
weigh in and say don't do that we'll
we'll put you in jail if you go too far
now
uh
some people are saying um
are they just using the power of the
state to shut down
dissent
well i don't know i mean it seems to me
this could go either way because
who exactly
approves of people getting physical for
example or threatening somebody at home
i'm not sure i approve of that stuff
and that stuff needs to probably be
illegal
at some point right
so i'm not sure there's anything to this
story we we imagine this is it's always
the slippery slope
toward uh
you know
having parents not have any input at all
but i doubt it i imagine parents can
have as much input as they want as long
as i don't push or threaten people
all right a lot of hallucinators coming
after me today
people who are
declaring my idiocy
in a hallucination that they had
and then criticizing me for their
hallucinations
for example
if i say something about
covet or anything in that category i got
this comment
to me you don't understand the risks
well shouldn't they be
arguing with my argument
why are they arguing about with some
quality of me
as soon as you see that what is that
signal
what does it signal when somebody goes
after the messenger it doesn't even
touch the argument
cognitive dissonance right is cognitive
distance because if the argument was the
problem well they would just go after
the argument
they'd just publish a link or say well
that makes no sense because you haven't
considered x or y
but they can't
the problem is
that they don't know how to do that
so
anybody who who has a counter argument
that makes sense uses it
you'll rarely find an exception people
don't go after like the personality of
the person unless
you unless they have nothing to say
um
yeah
so here's another one uh
somebody said to me you don't understand
that it's politicians that close the
economy not viruses because i was
talking about the
risk of coronavirus would be closing the
economy
well yes i know that the politicians
make the decision
but we haven't turned off the laws of
cause and effect
whatever made them to make the decision
last time
might make them cause it again
you could argue all day long that they
shouldn't close the economy
but if we know it happens it's part of
the risk
right you can't turn off cause and
effect just because you think it ought
to be turned off
and my favorite one is that i used to be
smart and have good takes but suddenly
all my takes are crap now
one of the odds
that i went from
clever for decades to really dumb on
just this one topic
possible
totally possible right
somebody could be smart and general and
dumb on one topic probably seen a lot
but it shouldn't be your first guess
play the odds
play the odds i probably didn't get
suddenly stupid
there's probably just something that
we differ in the data we differ in what
is logical
tell me what that is we'll see what we
can do
somebody says it's the marijuana and i
got a stupider
well you have no idea how much marijuana
i smoked when i was younger
let's talk about that facebook
whistleblower
so this uh
is hoggin i guess it is hogan
um
so
apparently it's just a fact now that
instagram
harms uh
children especially young girls
do we accept that as just a fact now
just a fact
and so i asked this uh
in a poll on twitter
i said what do you think will harm the
most teens and say the next year
vaccinations
instagram or fentanyl
which one of those things is the most
dangerous to kids
i feel like it's instagram by a lot
and in fact that was the poll result you
know this is highly unscientific poll
but instagram got 39
and the vaccinations got 29 and fentanyl
got 31.
so according to the unscientific poll
instagram is more dangerous than
fentanyl and vaccinations
um
joe manchin is holding tight with
and mostly because of the debt ceiling
so joe manchin says that the 3.5 million
would just be too much money
too much money
how does geomancing decide that
what is the
what mechanism does joe manchin use
to know how much debt is the right
amount
did he talk to economists
because
they don't know
the economists don't know how much is
there how much is the amount of debt
that would crush us and how much is
going to pay for itself for example you
know biden says it's going to pay for
itself
now he might be a businessman
um yeah i'm not saying he's dumb
he seems like a high functioning person
but
he's holding up the entire country
and frankly i'm glad he is
you know so i'm not anti-joe manchin
right
so
understand where i'm coming from i'm not
anti-joe manchin
and i'm kind of glad he's holding up the
the vote on the infrastructure thing
but you have to ask the question based
on what
what is his reasoning
i like it
but what's his reasoning
he's not a he's not an economist right
and even the economists don't know how
much is the right amount of debt
so it's kind of a weird situation that
we've got one person in charge of
congress and
he's making decisions based on
absolutely no expertise or knowledge
i think he'd probably admit it
if you ask them the direct question
what is the right amount of debt because
it's not zero
right if you say to me scott the right
amount of debt is zero no it's not
no it's very much not zero
it's some large number i just don't know
at what point is the breaking point
i mean debt is good if you use it right
debt is not bad universally sometimes
you need to invest in stuff
um
manchester is one of 52 senators so you
can't say he's holding you up yeah your
point is taken he's one of 52 signatures
but he's the only one that matters
because
for all the obvious reasons so you know
what i'm saying
but i get your point
uh paul reuben writes in the wall street
journal that the woke
he calls the woke lefts primitive
economics
and his point is
that
um
the the socialism
kind of model works good in a tribal
situation where your
amount of stuff is limited
if you can only gather a limited amount
of stuff or grow a limited amount of
stuff or hunt a limited amount of stuff
you kind of have to share it with the
tribe
socialism
but
capitalism breaks that model
and capitalism
is where you everybody gets more
so instead of dividing what you have you
just make more and then everybody gets a
little and then the capitalist gets the
most
that's the incentive
so
do you buy that do you buy that the main
difference between the
the left and the right's views on
economics
is that the
right actually understands economics
at least they understand
supply and demand and they understand
human motivation
right the right understands human
motivation
and they calculate it in all of their
systems and policies and the left
doesn't
they act like it's not a variable
which is wrong every time
it's never right
as soon as you ignore human motivation
you're wrong every time
every time you're developing a policy or
a system
uh see do you buy that
i would go so far as to say that both
the left and the right get science wrong
way too often
it has nothing to do with being on the
left or the right
getting science wrong just means that
humans aren't really good at science
you know we think we are we can get the
basics but then we're yeah we're done
after that
um so i think we're both wrong in the
science on different things in different
times
but only one side gets the economics
wrong
will you go with me on that
that any human can get science wrong
that's pretty easy because we just don't
quite have the brains that can
grasp the higher level stuff
but economics
conservatives understand that human
motivation's got to be a top variable or
nothing works
they got that part right
and the left doesn't
so i'd say everybody's bad is science
but only the left is bad at economics
of course these are gross
generalizations obviously
all right um
i saw viva
fry use the term experimental in a tweet
today
for the coveted vaccination
i would like to suggest that anybody who
uses the word
experimental for the vaccination and of
course i know what you mean you know
everybody understands
that it was you know
a quick job and wasn't tested as long as
other vaccinations and stuff
and also new technology but calling it
experimental i would say is
word thinking
meaning it's trying to win an argument
with a word and that's that's not how it
works
i mean it can work but that's not how
you should win an argument with a word
you know don't define a word and say
you're done
and i would argue that experimental
might be cognitive dissonance
be a tell for cognitive dissonance if
you're using that word
it's perfectly
it's perfectly reasonable to say all the
following things
we don't have as much of a track record
and at least two of the vaccinations are
a platform that we have less experience
with
does that increase your risk
well we don't know if it increases the
actual risk but increases the perceived
risk which is what you make your
decisions on
so
i would
argue that
you don't want to use the word
experimental it's sort of a tell that
you're not thinking through
um or let me say let me put it this way
the way i receive it
since i can't read your mind i don't
know i don't know what anybody's
thinking when they say it but the way
it's received is oh this is propaganda
word
and then i turn off the rest of the
sentence
so uh persuasion advice
to viva who i generally agree with
most things i can't even think of
anything i disagree with them
but just a persuasion
suggestion don't use the word
experimental and that that really
that really puts you in a category and i
don't think you want to be there
um here's my take
see how much of this you agree with or
disagree and i'll be watching the
comments as i go okay
i say without being an expert on any of
this stuff and by the way you should
watch viva and barnes it's a great it
was one of the best podcasts in my
opinion
one of the best
podcasts out there
let me see how much of this the
following you agree with
number one
that every vaccination is a different
risk management decision
by itself it has to be looked at by
itself
as its own risk management everybody
agree with that so far such that
let's say you had lots of experiments
experience with chickenpox vaccination
what does it tell you about measles
vaccinations
a little bit maybe
but certainly no certainty because
they're different
and the risk is different etc
now
i've said that the risk of covid is a
risk to the economy
whereas those other ones are not
let me i know i'm going to get a push
back on this so let me put that out
there and see your comments
coven is a risk to the economy
but the others were not
why somebody says why is it because the
data suggests that it's a risk to the
economy
doesn't matter
if you're thinking scott scott scott
we shouldn't have closed the economy
that's the wrong answer
what we should or shouldn't do is
irrelevant to your risk management
decision
what we would do
is relevant
what you should do is not part of the
conversation
we're not doing what we should
we're doing what we're doing
you know and everybody's might have a
different opinion of what we should do
so should is
a word that shouldn't be part of your
calculation
just look at the cause and effect
given the government we have
and we can't change it right the
government we have the public we have
the risk that we have
if kovid started killing um
you know way more people than it is at
the moment because we just opened
everything up and dropped all the
restrictions and i don't know if that'd
make a difference but let's just say it
does
um
that would close the economy
maybe you disagree
and maybe if you were in charge you
wouldn't close the economy
that's irrelevant
you're not in charge
the people who are in charge
will feel that they'll lose their jobs
if too many people die
so their incentive as
a government officials their incentive
unfortunately doesn't align with yours
your incentive is to run your life
with the risk management that you feel
comfortable with
that's not their incentive
their incentive is not for you to run
your life with your own risk reward
their incentive is to have the fewest
number of people die or get hospitalized
because that's how they keep their jobs
so they're not about the same risk
management calculation you're about
you're not even on the same team
similar to drafting you
for
the war
you getting drafted might be really bad
for you
well that's not why they did it they
didn't draft you for your benefit
they drafted you to go in the war for
the the nation's benefit so the
individual calculation and the
uh the government's calculation will
always be different in this kind of
situation and maybe has to be
maybe it has to be
and you can't change the fact that they
will manage to the lowest number of
deaths
that's not going to change
so if you if cove
went wild or wilder or was completely
uncontrolled and they were saying no
vaccinations or anything else
would it close the economy
yeah of course it would of course it
would because it did before
i think it would again
the same forces would be at work
you just have to get the death rate up
to a certain level then everything would
close again
maybe differently we might be smarter
about it how we close things but
it's it's going to be a drag down the
economy
so here's my take
the coveted vaccination did not have the
same risk profile as either as any of
the prior vaccinations
if we had the luxury
of waiting five to fifteen years of
watching the coveted vaccination
before making it you know more mandatory
or at least requiring it for certain
things i suppose
um we'd we'd love to do
that we all agree on that right
if we had the luxury to wait five or 15
years
to just watch this
coven vaccination to feel really safe
about it we'd all love that
but we don't
that's not one of the choices
one of the choices is you better do
something pretty quick or you're in
trouble
so that risk profile is not like measles
it's not like chicken pox
so the moment you say well let's treat
them you know like
like they're somehow the similar class
of risk
completely wrong
there they might be a similar
but remember your individual risk
has nothing to do with what the
government does
because they don't care about your
individual risk they care about the
group risk
so you might say to yourself well i got
a kid my kids no way they're going to
get coveted and die
you know so you know kids of course i
think have to be their own class for
analysis
so i agree with that i don't think you
make one rule and it applies to kids and
applies to everybody but but we're not
we are making different rules for
different ages as we should
so
group risk should include economics that
is correct group risk should include the
economics
so
let's see if we can agree with the
following statements
nobody including our experts
are super good at evaluating risks
true
nobody
including our experts
are super good at evaluating risk who's
on board with that so far
we're all bad at it even the experts
because there's a little bit of guessing
going on right
but
there are some things that you as an
individual can make a decision on
without knowing all the risks
such as
your personal freedom
right
do you need to know everything about
your risks to make a good decision about
your own personal freedom nope
no
you could be wrong
it's your personal freedom
emphasis on personal
you can be wrong about your risk it's
your decision
you get to make that decision unless the
government tries to stop it
so
i think that
comparing the vaccinations any
vaccination to any other is bad thinking
because their risk profiles are
different and we should not expect that
we would treat them the same
if the risk of covet is more immediate
and affects the economy and maybe it's a
bigger population of people who die
don't know if that's true
but if you believe it's true
you would treat them differently
and one of the things you might do
is rush
a vaccination
something you would never do if you had
the luxury of waiting
but you don't
all right
fda approved more rapid testing looks
like a big deal cost as little as 10
already there are several companies that
make them but this new one acon
it's going to double the capacity
and you get a
looks like it's a nasal swab and you get
a
you get a answer in 15 minutes
somebody's going to win a pool as their
prize for figuring out why this hasn't
already been done
because here are the problems we didn't
have
we didn't have a problem with money
capacity science
know-how
anything
we didn't have any
we didn't have any obstacles
i mean not we didn't have any obstacles
that would have stopped us
from having the same availability as
some european countries already have
right we had no more obstacles than they
did and probably more resources
so why did it take us so long
it has to be corruption
now i understand that
scott gottlieb's book may attribute it
to um
bureaucracy
not buying that for a second and i'm not
sure he's talking about the same thing i
i didn't read it i just heard about it
so
maybe conflating two different stories i
think i might be actually
but the point is we don't know
does that bother you
we don't know why this took so long
and i don't buy
the bureaucracy because you know also
stopped would have stopped vaccinations
the bureaucracy are you telling me that
the bureaucracy
approved super
uh let's say
provocative or controversial
vaccinations on a you know a compressed
timeline you tell me the the bureaucracy
got that done
and they couldn't approve
tests which would have essentially no
risk they couldn't do that so the
bureaucracy can approve the hardest
thing you could possibly ever approve
rapid vaccinations
and they couldn't approve
a test that doesn't even
affect your body
seriously
that's not the bureaucracy
trust me
i you know
there are a few people who appreciate
the power of the bureaucracy more than
the
creator of dilbert
but this doesn't look like bureaucracy
to me
this looks like some kind of corruption
i don't know who or where
but it's some kind
so somebody's gonna get a pool of
surprise for digging into that and
finding out who it was and
what their benefit was for stopping it
um
there's a you know the book peril
that everybody's talking about by
woodward
john dickerson of cbs news
uh talks about he says in the book peril
the verbatim transcript between speaker
pelosi and general miller is fascinating
how they talk what is said and left
unsaid
dialogue in many non-fiction political
political books can sound like a film
student's first draft of an action movie
but this
raw transcript is chilling
to which i say
was there really a transcript
is there an actual written transcript of
an actual private conversation between
pelosi and millie
and
a author of a book had access to it
what can somebody give me a fact check
on that
is there an actual transcript
like it was recorded and then released
that's not true is it oh so this is a
foia
maybe yeah i doubt it but so we don't
know the the details of this story but
let me add a generic
which is this
are you aware that when people are
quoted in
books it's rarely what the person
actually said
how many of you know that
how many of you know that when you see
somebody's exact words in quotes in an
article or a book
chances are very high like maybe 85
percent
that they didn't say that
did you know as high as
you know that's just my experience 85
percent of the time it's a it's a
manufactured quote
they're manufactured
in other words the the journalist or
writer
talks to the subject for a long period
of time
and then says to themself well he said
three or four things about this topic
but they're kind of long and they don't
fit into a quote so i'm gonna i'm gonna
bake them into a little quote i'm gonna
put quotes around it because i i feel
like i've captured the essence of what
he was trying to say
and i'll just put a quote around it so
it doesn't look like i'm saying it
super common do you know how many times
i've seen my own words uh with quotation
marks around them and articles
a lot
hundreds hundreds and hundreds many
hundreds of times i've seen myself
quoted in the news how many of those
times did i actually say the actual
sentence that's in the quote
10 20
that's it
the rest are literally made up
and as a consumer if you don't know that
you're really going to be confused about
what's really happening
all right
let's talk about the good news
for the golden age
you know the adam's law of slow moving
disasters it says that if society can
see a big problem coming for long enough
we've got lots of warning
we always fix it
we always do we didn't run out of food
we didn't run out of oil you know and we
close the ozone hole
we'll fix climate change
like that's that's my personal
optimistic view yeah because we had
enough time
even though it looks like we don't have
enough time and we're we're rushing
against you know the rising temperatures
i think we have enough time
but here are a few things that are
happening
number one
a
company called dimensional energy
they're making jet fuel which is the
hardest thing to replace if you're
trying to
you know get to a low carbon situation
it's hard to replace jet fuel because
you can't do it with a battery
except for small planes
but for a big jet we don't have a
battery capacity for that
but this company dimensional energy
sucks the co2 out of the air
puts it through a chemical process and
creates
jet fuel
out of the air
they suck jet fuel
out of the air
now it's not jet fuel when they suck it
out it's just co2
but they
chemically translate into the jet fuel
and apparently they're going to power
this whole thing with the sun
so they'll have a big sun factory out in
the desert somewhere or someplace remote
and the sun will burn down and create
enough energy to
translate this co2 that they sucked out
of the air into jet fuel
now jeff fuel
is one of the bigger contributors to
climate change so it's a big deal
and they it's even better than you think
they think that at a scale
once they build the bigger operation
they can get the cost of a gallon of jet
fuel down to a dollar
follow the money
if the economics of this are accurate
this is the only way we're going to make
jeff fuel
we're not going to make jeff fuel any
other way if you can make it for a
dollar a gallon
i don't know what jeff fuel costs but
i'm sure it's more as much or more than
a
tank of gas for your car that's five
bucks in california
um
so that's good news and it's already
working at uh small scale so we don't
have to wonder about the technology all
we have to do is scale it up
it's now an engineering problem
let me say that again
the solution to climate change
if this is true
if you can actually do this as as
inexpensively as they claim
if that's true
we're done yeah is the climate change is
just an engineering problem now it's not
a political problem
it's not a scientific problem
it's just an engineering problem you get
a bunch of engineers to build a bunch of
these plants they suck it out of the air
boom we're done
here's another one good news
company called
i don't know the name of the company
but they've built a gigantic warehouse
like really gigantic using ai and
robotics and stuff like that
and apparently
it's in the appalachian mountains
and if you do it right and it's a high
high-tech operation
you reduce the water use by something
like 90 percent
so you've got this gigantic water
problem
and also a gigantic cost of living
problem and they can substantially
reduce the cost of food
substantially reduce the the use of
water which is a big deal because
agriculture uses most of your water
and
um probably bring down the cost of food
as well as the shipping costs because in
theory you could build one of these
facilities or more in every population
center and then suddenly
you don't have to ship it i mean as far
so
this is gigantic
are you worried about climate change
making it too hard to grow food
problem solved
and again
all this has to do is be economical
and you're done
we'll just build more of them
just keep building
and i think this is part of the answer
to uh housing
and just a uh an inexpensive life
that uh doesn't break the bank this
might be part of it
um well there's news that uh dan scavino
is missing in action and they can't
serve him the subpoenas they want to to
have him testimony testify about january
6.
there's a rumor that dan scavino went
hiking in the carlton preserve
anybody
anybody
there's a rumor that he went hiking in
the carlton preserve
now some of you got that joke
some of you got that joke it's not true
but
i'm not even gonna explain it
ask a friend
[Laughter]
if you didn't get that joke
all right let's talk about taiwan taiwan
and china so as you know china is
sending a bunch of warships flying over
taiwan
and
jack passabek tweeted that about the
taiwan stuff he says it's heating up
more than people realize
he says this isn't just posturing
there are top chinese generals telling
yeshi
they want the green light
to attack taiwan
what's your interpretation of this story
let's let's take it as a given that uh
jack pasabic has good sources
that's been my experience he has good
sources so i'm going to take as true
that we have some intel on this and he
started how do you interpret that do you
interpret it as oh my god war is going
to break out any moment
because the generals are itching to do
it
i don't
here's my interpretation
if you're a general
you need to tell she you're ready to go
give me the green light
isn't that just good generally
generals being generals don't we have an
attack plan for basically everything
don't our generals have a plan for
attacking just about anything including
china
of course they do
and don't those generals probably tell
their commander-in-chief in the united
states not on this topic but on other
topics you know let us do it
they said that in afghanistan right yeah
let us stay let's keep some people there
forever
the most ordinary thing in the world
bordering on
nothing
is generals wanting to fight wars or at
least telling the boss they want to
fight a war
telling the boss you know put us in the
game is just
seems good politics i i i'm not sure i
could go so far as to say that that's
telling us
they're ready to strike
because i can't imagine that china would
benefit from it
i think their economy would be crashed
for 100 years
and i think they'd know that
um
cnn has a story that says uh in several
states texas idaho alabama georgia
oklahoma kentucky arkansas and north
carolina
have 15 or less of their icu capacity
available so icu capacity in those
states i mentioned
15 or less capacity
anybody
in the comments
in the comments why is that fake news
come on you're all trained you know this
one you all know this one that's the
normal amount
of capacity in an icu
15 capacity
is a lot actually it's not it's not
tight that means that they wish they had
more
because the icus try to operate you know
close to that level
because they're expensive so you want to
utilize them as much as possible so you
build them
such that they're always
close to capacity
so cnn reports this without ever telling
you what the normal capacity is for an
icu
yeah some somebody in the comments says
90 is the goal
this is the fakest of fake news now
i'm not telling you that that's you know
that's enough capacity because you could
crash that with a wave i guess of covid
but they need that little context here
please
all right monica lewinsky is
i think there's some documentary about
monica lewinsky now so she's in the news
again she says bill clinton's uh
role in the affair scandal was
wholly inappropriate i guess we all
agree with that
as as was hers and she says the same
thing her own role she's not defending
but
what about the part about going public
those are two different crimes if i
could use crime in a generic sense not a
technical sense
because
bill clinton made one bad mistake
which was
monica lewinsky
monica lewinsky made
two bad mistakes one was getting
involved in the affair she was an adult
yes i understand the power differential
and all that but she was an adult
we don't give adults a pass
right we don't give adults a pass
clinton lied and he should have i
approve of his lie
i approve of his lie
for the country
was the country better off if you found
out that the affair was real
did that help you in some way
no it just caused us to be caught up in
some impeachment drama
it didn't help the country
so
this is my opinion bill clinton yes what
he did he has to answer for and he has
what monica did in terms of the affairs
she has to answer for and she has and
she takes responsibility and i
appreciate that
but the real crime here was the making
it public
am i wrong
that that was the bigger crime because
that's the part that paralyzed the
country
they could have had sex all day long in
the oval office if they just didn't tell
us about it
still would be wholly inappropriate
but at least you know the
commander-in-chief would
not be so tense
yeah so her friend linda trepp who
talked her into it
um
you know certainly has
some responsibility there too
but i can't give
monica lewinsky a pass for making this
public
that is one of the worst things any
citizen has done to this country
short of terrorism
is that hyperbole it's one of the worst
things a citizen has done to the country
short of terrorism
and you know mass shootings and stuff
somebody says not even close
their affair was outed by drudge
that's not the way i remember it
maybe i do need a fact check on this but
i remember it as
maybe drudge outed it but it wouldn't
have been a thing unless she admitted it
right
i think it was the admitting it that
made it a thing because presidents being
accused of having affairs is is kind of
you know
one news cycle and gone
that's not really the the big problem
just being accused it's the admitting it
that's the problem
all right
um
and i also think that this whole thing
infantilizes women
it infantilizes women
put your uh let's do the alan dershowitz
test okay
here's the alan dershowitz test
imagine the affair happened but the 22
year old in the story was male
would we treat a male 22 year old who
had an affair let's say with
angela merkel or something
would we treat that 22 year old as like
oh there was a power differential
even though there would be and even
though it does matter i'm certainly
agreeing it matters
but would we treat these situations the
same
i'm gonna say no
i'm gonna say no i think we're
infantilizing women here
i think it's
insanely
sexist to imagine that monica was just a
victim to the the power and the
situation
i just don't think a man would be
treated like this
i think a man would be treated with more
respect frankly
and i don't think that's cool
all right
bill gates is part of fake news you
probably some of you might have fallen
for this the story is that in a 2010 ted
talk
he talked about using vaccinations to
reduce population growth
people interpreted that as killing
people
to reduce the population
no he didn't say that he also did not
say we'll vaccinate people to you know
make them unable to have children
no he didn't say that the context was
that
vaccinated societies do better and when
countries do better
economically
their uh
their birth rate goes down automatically
so what bill gates said
was
sort of a big nothing
if you vaccinate better uh these
developing countries
they would be part of a package of
things that make them do better
and as they do better they have fewer
kids
is that is that controversial
now you might say we shouldn't get
vaccinations that's a separate question
but it's not really controversial to say
that the population might self-regulate
if the country does better
all right
um
birth rate goes down but infant
mortality improves so it is wash i mean
you could argue that he has the math
wrong that's a separate question
um
how much market share is apple versus
android quit selling apple products you
sell out
what
now i i'll say it again
as many times as it takes we can't treat
the companies that have established
business in china the same as a company
that's planning to go there
that's just not the same analysis you
have to let the big companies unwind at
their own speed whatever makes sense
economically
but you can i think you can be
assured
that
apple and
you know their management team
they're looking at alternatives to china
if you think they're not looking pretty
hard at alternatives to china just to
minimize their own risk you're crazy
but i'm just saying that we don't need
to make them leave today
right it would be enough
to just give them you know give them
their flexibility to get out at their
own speed
uh is a question about boo my cat i have
only bad news about boo unfortunately
she's not eating on her own i thought
she did for like a day she was licking
some food but she stopped
um she it's not looking good for boo the
cat
but that's another story
all right so
um
let's see
i got some pushback on
twitter
for mentioning that
vaccine mandates
would not be unique
and the problem is we just got used to
it
well everything you do is mandated
in terms of the
you know the guard rails of what you can
and can't do
and i use seat belts as my example and
everybody did the the analogy thing
where if you say oh scott that's a bad
analogy because here are the differences
between a seat belt and a vaccination
now
does anybody think i didn't know that
seatbelts and vaccinations were actually
different things
i will stipulate
that everything about a vaccination
everything is different from everything
about
sea belts
except one thing which was my point
just one thing the government makes you
do it
that's all
that's all i'm not saying they're the
same
i'm just saying you live in a world in
which the government makes you do all
kinds of stuff
that maybe you don't want to do
so if if your argument is the slippery
slope
well you've been sliding that slippery
slope forever
which doesn't mean i'm in favor of
mandates i'm opposed to mandates
hear that part i'm opposed to mandates
but i'm also opposed to bad arguments
i'm opposed to mandates and bad
arguments we live in a world in which we
have willingly given the government all
kinds of control over our bodies
and we just got used to it so we don't
notice it really i guess
it's just that when it when it comes to
this we notice it now let me ask you
this
why is it that we're treating this
particular risk
or and mandate
so different
don't our other mandates have a have a
potential to kill us or make us lose
money also
this isn't the only mandate that has a
negative impact on people is it
for example instituting the draft
and that's a pretty big impact on people
but we allow that
under the right conditions
so i'm going to make a provocative
statement
that your opinion on vaccinations was
probably
a sign to you
you don't know it
your opinion on vaccinations was
probably assigned to you by the media
because that's where our opinions come
from
if you have an opinion that doesn't
match anything that you're reading in
the media it might be your own opinion
if your opinion exactly matches stuff
you're seeing on social media
it could be because you're all smart
i don't think so
i think it's more because your opinion
got assigned to you and you you accepted
it
so not only are you accepting mandates
it's worse
you're accepting opinions
you're actually taking the government's
or in some cases you know some other
entity like
fox news or whatever you're reading and
you're letting them give you an opinion
that you think is your own now
i know you think it's your own opinion
that's how it works it always feels like
it's your own opinion but unless it's
unique
you can't tell
scott trying to label people
what
what where did i just label people
uh
south korean doctors on youtube are a
good source
oh um ask do you believe hunter is
actually painting the pictures he is
selling
i don't think you can assume it
but i don't think that they're so good
that i would rule it out
um
how about my opinion is it assigned well
my opinion i believe does not match to
any of the major opinions
my opinion is that the vaccination is a
good idea for lots of people
and i'm in that category where the risk
reward
based on you know incomplete information
but it looks like it might be a good
decision for people in my category it
might be a bad decision for somebody in
some other
demographic
but i don't think we should have
mandates
so i don't know which side is telling
you that
the vaccinations might be a good idea
but you don't need mandates
so i i suppose there are plenty of
people with that opinion too
um scott's opinion seems like things
we've heard before
i don't know that you've heard my
opinion breaking down the
the
risk management before i think i'm the
only one talking about it that way
um
yeah you know that's the government
tracking your up down to six hundred
dollars the transactions into your bank
account
that's
that's going to change a lot of behavior
because here's the problem
a huge part of the american economy is
criminal
small business
one of the dark secrets of small
business is that they're
mostly criminal enterprises
no matter what they look like on the
surface
they're almost certainly cheating on
their taxes
sorry almost not all of them you know
there could be small businesses that are
just playing it totally straight
but small businesses have a lot of
flexibility to take cash
pretty much all of them do
pretty much all of them don't declare it
but they got to put that cash some more
so put it in the bank
so what's going to happen with this bank
thing let's make a prediction
what's going to happen will the small
businesses stop taking cash
and
or just start paying taxes on it
probably not
will they take that money and still put
it in the bank
where they will easily be caught
because their their deposits are
outweigh their income so it'll raise the
flag
probably not here's what's going to
happen
you're going to create a secondary
market for cash
and it won't be banks
you're gonna create this underground
cash network
where people will be laundering their
cash through friends
okay
let me give you an example
uh if i make a uh
let's say let's say i made a 5 000 cash
deposit in my bank
would it raise any flags
nope
nope because the amounts of my
transactions are largish
and even if i have never made a i don't
think i've ever made a five thousand
dollar cash deposit but even if i did
people would say
that's that's within the range of what
he does so i could launder your money
you could come to me and say hey
you know i got this five thousand
dollars could you put it in your bank
and we'll trade something that can't be
can't be noticed i'd say sure
because i have no problem depositing it
it just looks like normal business for
me
so
you're going to find these
money laundering will just be pervasive
crack you know cash laundering
um and then crypto is probably part of
the answer yeah i'm seeing i'm being
prompted for that crypto will have some
impact i don't know exactly what what
that will look like
uh look at europe to see where this goes
don't try to guess
no
interesting somebody says in europe it's
already there
so
i repeat after me i just sold my boat
[Laughter]
exactly
but
if you sell your boat every week they're
going to notice see that's why
i could put
5000 in the bank and say i sold the boat
nobody's good
nobody's going to look at it twice
yes the dilbert calendars are made in
china and almost all of the products i
use probably made in china is
for those of you who want to do a gotcha
on me
it doesn't work
because i'm telling you
i'm not going to stop buying chinese
products if i need them and it's the
only place i can get them or even just
convenience
i'm telling you that we have to stop new
business going in that's practical
and stopping buying everything from
china is impractical and making all the
companies move out right away
isn't practical so i'm in i'm in favor
of practical things
i i realize that this creates an
inconsistency philosophical
philosophically but you're not catching
me i'm telling you i'm doing that
there's no gotcha here
right yes dilbert products are printed
in china i hate it
it's not going to change overnight
will i talk to my publisher about it of
course do they have options probably not
all right
um yeah i mean we can we can be
practical we don't have to be
absolutists
all right that is all i needed to say
today i'm pretty sure
yes it is and that means i've got to go
do something else it's time
somebody says that's a lame excuse
is it
is it
is being practical
a lame excuse
no it isn't
being practical is always practical
so anyway i'll talk to you later
