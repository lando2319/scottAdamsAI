he's ever had
before today and all you need for that
is a cuper muger glass a tanker chal
just d a canteen jug or flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dopamine h
of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go that's a little thing I learned from
Joe Biden you whisper the important
parts go savor it see very
effective oh my okay well here's some uh
news about AI I asked Google's Bard
about myself I like to see what AI think
about me and it said that I wrote
several books and I thought well that's
pretty good
that that is correct I am an author I
have written several books and then it
listed several
books several of them don't exist as
books at all and I certainly didn't
write them but it also says on the
author of a book called
influence written by it's actually
written by delini so a so Google's
borrowed as me as the author of uh
chini's famous book influence which I
had nothing to do with of course course
uh but does say I wrote several other
books that literally don't
exist so can somebody tell me what good
AI will
be if it just lies to you I don't
know all right so uh you all know that
Elon Musk is starting his own school
he's got approval I guess um for high
school I think it's a high school and
maybe a grade school and they'll prepare
kids for
stem to which I
say Does Elon Musk have to solve all of
our
problems could we have one problem we
can handle on our own can Elon can you
give us one
thing give us an easy one I know we
can't do the hard things if you said all
right you're on your own go to Mars I'd
be like okay you handle Mars okay you
handle
Mars we'll do the easy
stuff
hours all right all right but you can
handle the uh Universal internet
connection via satellite no no we can't
do that either you do that you do that
what about education oh okay we got this
we oh teachers unions okay we can't do
the education thing either okay you got
education but I swear to God the next
thing we're going to do you don't have
to do everything Elon the next big
problem problem we'll take care of it
how about uh regaining freedom of
speech okay you do that one too you do
that one too but I swear to God the next
thing we're going to do the rest of us
have to do something we got to chip in a
little bit
okay um speaking of uh X and Alex
Jones saw a funny post by Shawn Davis
who said the people who brought you the
Russia collusion hoax cran impeachment
hoax the fine people hoax the cavano rap
hoax the Covington hoax and the covid-19
origin hoax are big mad that Alex Jones
is back on
Twitter well I call it
X Sean Davis but uh your point is well
made well made
yeah I I wonder if anybody's done
a um straight up comparison of Alex
Jones versus
CNN
now I'm aware that Alex Jones has made
some claims that may not have panned out
may not have panned out crisis actors
being at the top of the list but here's
the
thing is his track record worse than
CNN because there is a qualitative
difference here's a qualitative
difference I think Alex Jones believes
everything he said including about Sandy
Hook he was wrong but I think he
believed it do you because I don't see
another reason he would have done it
really it does it doesn't sort of make
sense unless you believed it was true
now it wasn't true but I'd love to see
his overall track record compared to CNN
I think he'd do well actually I mean I
don't know how many other things there
are like Sandy Hook but but here's my
other problem with Sandy Hook I don't
really understand
how he lost the
case how was it defamation if he
believed it was
true did somehow did a did a court prove
that he knew it wasn't true how could
that how could that have
happened is that Poss I don't under I I
don't understand how he possibly could
have been found guilty of defamation
unless he knew it wasn't true isn't that
isn't it a requirement that you know
it's not true
I thought you could be wrong all day
long and it wouldn't be
legal you can't be
wrong because I feel like I'm wrong
about a lot of stuff am I defaming
people if I'm just honest and
wrong I don't understand any of that
maybe somebody can explain it to me it's
a default judgment what does that
mean didn't pay attention to the trial
it's complic ated all right well I don't
understand what happened to him but it
does make sense that he's
back speaking of
misinformation have you heard of a group
called
newsguard how many of you recognize the
name newsguard and kind of know who they
are right unless you follow people like
Mike
Ben uh you probably don't know what
newsart is but allegedly it is a
primarily a
misinformation purveyor disguised as a
misinformation
fighter so they probably do fight some
misinformation but that's the cover that
you use if you're really a political
entity so they seem to be a political
entity pretending to be a information
guarding entity and uh X itself reported
today that newsguard is about to publish
a quote report they put report in
quotes because this was on x uh report
on misinformation on X and then as a
for-profit company they will only share
the data that underpins or purported
research if you pay for it so if you
have to pay for it and X is warning
you uh and of course the reason for this
is going to pressure companies to uh buy
their factchecking services so anyway
it's
uh they're asking people who buy their
service X is asking if any wants to see
that quote
misinformation ask to see the source
information as to see how they
determined it do you think that they'll
be able to show their clients the
process exactly by which they determined
this I doubt it I doubt it because I
don't think the facts would support
their conclusions so we'll see now uh
everything I know about News Guard just
comes from other people so just so they
don't sue me I'll say I don't know I
don't know what's true about newscard
but what I hear from credible people is
that they're in the misinformation game
not the information
game well
science has uh found a way or they're
getting close to mimicking
photosynthesis so as much as we like to
use our solar panels they're not as
efficient as nature and nature uses
photosynthesis but apparently there are
some re researchers
now um there's a report in ACS
engineering there's some researchers
they've got some technology that looks
promising it's not too close to being um
operational but looks promising and
they've got something that would
chemically
change uh carbon dioxide water they
create methane and that's a high energy
fuel they created from nothing but
carbon dioxide water and
sunlight now I ask again my provocative
question can somebody tell me which of
the hundreds of uh climate model
predictions include the variable that we
would turn carbon dioxide into
methane what happens if the carbon
dioxide is the
fuel because apparently we're on the
verge of being able to turn
the the worst thing in the world into
free fuel or not free but you'd be
sucking it out of the air so who saw
that coming I don't know if this will
ever become operational and economical
but it's knocking on the door
likewise separately Quantum batteries
are getting close to being a real thing
now let me explain how a Quantum battery
works compared to a regular lithium
battery with your regular lithium
battery you've got uh a lithium things
happening but then as opposed to your
Quantum batteries which are not
developed yet but are getting close
maybe they might work they would use a
Quantum non-lithium
process which would have nothing to do
with
methane I think I've clarified that
enough do you need the details or are
you good with that yeah Quantum stuff
Quantum ised particle
in the quantum through the black hole in
the quantum IED Quantum way and that's
how they
work and if you need any more
clarification than that well you came to
the wrong
place but uh it's exciting we might have
these amazing batteries that are quickly
powered up and stuff like that so again
which climate model accounted for the
quantum batteries none none there is no
climate model that accounts for your
Quantum battery that's coming any day
now probably not any day now but
maybe all right Oklahoma is the next
state to kick de Dei diversity equity
and inclusion out of their public
education so you can't be a college or a
school in Oklahoma and have Dei now how
many how many states have banned it now
is it seven seven State how many states
Florida Texas
Oklahoma what's the account now I think
there's more but anyway how would you
like to be going to
school and being taught a
subject that is literally illegal in
other
states I'm just hold that in your
head is there anything else like that
where you go to school and you you pack
your little lunch pail you know you're
10 years old and you go to school and
you sit there and you learn something
that is literally illegal in another
state in the United
States probably there probably some
other stuff like that
but does that tell you what direction
we're
heading I'm pretty sure that we're
heading in the direction of you
know diso all Dei eventually I mean it's
OB vious that it has to happen
eventually all right the
NAACP issued a statement that says uh
the attacks on the Harvard president are
probably white supremacy and racists
right so Bill akman who's uh the most
notable Advocate big investor he's
advocating the three College presidents
who gave inadequate answers about Hamas
that they all be fired one of them is
gone
but
uh Claudine
gay um is still there and it looks like
she's going to stay and uh Harvard says
attacks on that are racist and bill
akman says how is it racist to attack
three College presidents two of whom are
white one is black attacking the ball
basically equally except you know one
had some extra plagiarism the others
didn't have
how was that racist
exactly I got a feeling that the NAACP
is maybe
uh it it's not
helping it's not
helping
anyway so that's pretty ridiculous so
Bill Amman um one of the things he's
doing that's a real
service is he's making the Democrats and
the left and the the people who be clut
and gay supporters he's just exposing
them he he's making them say in public
exactly what they feel and think and
what they want and it's sort of
devastating because now you can see it
you see it with your own eyes do you
think it's changing anybody's Minds
about
politics do you think all of the college
stuff is having an impact on the mind of
the average citizen or is this just for
the wonks that follow the news and
nobody else knows what's going on there
aren't that many people who probably
follow this
story do you think I don't know what
percentage of the country would even be
able to tell you what this story is
about
10% probably 30% have heard of it 10%
actually could describe it to you 5%
have a strong
opinion I don't know how important it is
but it might be seeping into the uh the
thinking of all
people
well um at least here's the good news
for Harvard at least the good news is
that their bad news is behind them now
right so whatever's going to happen it
looks like you know they're going to
weather the storm and I don't see
anything else that's going to pop up in
the news that would be embarrassing for
uh uh
Harvard um turns out that the mayor of
Boston is under Fire for having a
Christmas party that uh excludes white
people she graduated from Harvard in
2007 according to James
lindsy okay I take everything back
there's no end in sight to how bad
things we could give for
Harvard that's right the Boston mayor is
actually having a Christmas party that's
called the electeds of color Christmas
party it's elected officials excluding
directly excluding white
people graduated from Harvard in
2007 mayor of a major
city
so do you think this will have any
impact on anybody do you think people
are noticing that there's kind of a
trend kind of a pattern anybody noticing
the
pattern how many of you saw the clip or
watch
live V ramaswami on CNN I guess he was
talking to Abby Phillips and looked like
a sort of a town hall situation and she
asked about January
6 and uh they they did like several
minutes of talking over each other so
you couldn't hear anything and nothing
was happening
and uh it was really
entertaining because neither was willing
to let the other speak their their piece
and you run out of time basically you
know you don't want the other one to run
out the clock so Abby Phillips seemed to
be unwilling to let the say what he
wanted to say he was unwilling to let
her stop him from saying what he wanted
to say and he just wouldn't
stop because once once the cameras are
on and once the show is started here's
something that VI and Trump both
know once the show starts
you have all the control because they're
not going to stop the
show so as soon as the show started vake
simply didn't take no for an answer and
didn't take didn't take the
interruptions he he just bowled his way
through which was exactly the right
thing to do because she kept asking him
for reasons and when he offered the
reasons she talked over him at least
that's what it looked like you couldn't
really tell who was doing what but I
think she was trying to make you know
small points as he was talking which is
not cool let him talk so finally he got
to talk and the question was you know
why does he think there's a good chance
there was a uh let's say uh incitement
by law enforcement on January
6 and here are the uh evidences he
offers and I love the fact that he says
to the audience he said it several times
I know this will be uncomfortable for
CNN
that's a great line I know this will be
uncomfortable for CNN because they're
not going to want to hear in front of
their own audience he's going to have to
tell them that they've
been essentially presenting fake news
for a long time now I I've been waiting
for somebody who's not
Trump to dissect their fake news
Operation without the hyperbole to just
just sit write on it and point it out
but uh he didn't quite do that I know he
could but he didn't quite do that
instead he went to the evidence of
January 6 and here's what he said he
said uh first of all why did the January
6 committee only
select a certain video when other video
was exculpatory in other words showing
showing law enforcement opening the
doors and collegially inviting people in
that was pretty important
should have seen that should have seen
the uh law enforcement firing rubber
bullets into the
crowd which didn't seem exactly called
for it looks looked more like they were
trying to cause
trouble I mean it's hard to imagine how
it would have
worked um but we can't read mine so we
don't know that for sure um what about
uh when Christopher Ray was asked how
many
undercover people were there he he
declined to to answer do you know what
Abby Phillips interpreted decline to
answer as
meaning there's no evidence that there
were undercover of people there because
Christopher Ray declined to answer how
many there were so therefore there's no
evidence there weren't any there well
technically it's true it's technically
true that he did not provide evidence
that there were anybody there
undercover but Abby Phillips you know
they were you know they were of course
they were the only question is how many
and the question is why wouldn't he
answer that
question
now and then uh V went through the
Whitmer example Governor Whitmer A A
Perfect Analogy or uh let's say
precedent where the government did in
fact get caught red-handed inciting
people to do things that they wouldn't
have been inclined to to do on their own
so now you've got a perfect recent
template to show that the government
does this kind of stuff we don't have to
guess hey does your government do this
kind of stuff yes proven in court
remember how the uh Democrats say there
there's no election problems unless
they're proven in court well the
government inciting people to do crimes
they wouldn't have ordinarily done has
been proven
by the same bunch of people so now
you've got the model that proves that
they do it and it's a normal pattern
right it's not
abnormal you have the FBI who won't tell
you how many there were which means
there were people there the fact that
they won't tell you how many suggests
it's more than a trivial
number because no none of us can
imagine um Rey would have would have
hesitated to tell you if they didn't
have any impact it would have been easy
to say oh yes we always have operatives
but just a handful and certainly they
didn't have anything to do with what
happened how easy would it be to say
that yeah there there were a handful I
don't have the exact number but you know
we had half a dozen people there at
least somewhere in that neighborhood
less than 10 and they didn't have much
to do with anything they they weren't
inciting
anything just
observing now he didn't say that he
didn't say
that but if it had been a trivial amount
of undercover people why wouldn't you
say that it's not really giving up any
secrets because everybody assumes that
they were there in fact they wouldn't be
doing the job if they weren't keeping a
close eye on people who might be doing
something close to the line of legal
activities to totally appropriate for
their uh organization yeah and then
there's the rups thing that's still kind
of a question mark to some of
us uh so I think V made his point and
I'm going to support V additionally by
saying and I wish he had said this
because I think more people need to say
it um if you're talking about an
individual such as reeps reeps is
innocent till proven guilty that's my
take
it doesn't matter how guilty you think
he is by looking at it he's innocent
till proven guilty might he be be guilty
well that's for the courts to figure out
someday if there's any charge there's no
charge
but an individual has a different
standard than the government if the
government is hiding things from you and
you know that they've cherry-picked some
information they gave you your
assumption of their guilt is completely
legitimate you might be wrong you might
be wrong but your assumption of guilt
should be your operating standard you it
should be an operating assumption that
they're wrong because they can't confirm
that that they didn't do it now that's
what I would have loved to hear V say
look there's plenty of evidence to
suggest we've got a pattern of we've got
a pattern we can look to there's
evidence to suggest and all I'm saying
is that given the evidence we do have
you have to make the Assumption of guilt
for the government because there's no
transparency if there were transparency
I would rethink this but the government
is not an individual They're Not
Innocent to proven guilty they're
absolutely guilty until proven innocent
so we need to we need to make sure that
the public understands that standard
really clearly the government is guilty
until they prove they're not it has to
be that way that's not unreasonable they
have to be transparent or else you don't
know what they're up to and you could
assume they're up to no
good so what about the
election do you as a citizen have
confidence that you know what the code
of the voting machines is
doing I don't how would I so my
assumption is elections are
rigged not because I have information
affirmatively proven they are I don't
have anything like that what I have is
is a non-transparent system run by the
government in every case I will assume a
non-transparent system run by the
government is corrupt every time it
doesn't matter if it's elections or
anything else military industrial
complex the reason we go to war the
reason we do anything yeah I assume the
worst in all those cases whenever
there's a lack of transparency and how
often am I going to be right how often
will I be right by assuming the worst in
a non-transparent situation probably
most of the
time more than half probably more than
half so that's the attack I'd like to
see on that here's another attack um I
say that Dei diversity Equity inclusion
creates a hostile work
environment how many of you would
agree that Dei creates a hostile work
environment yeah now didn't we used to
think that was
bad I I used to think that was the worst
thing that happen because you know the
the me too stuff is not just the
individual acts of me ISM those are bad
of course but beyond that it creates a
hostile work environment right so we do
we do value this hostile work
environment as a a major major problem
in fact Biden himself said he would not
tolerate a hostile work environment in
his administration he said if basically
I'm paraphrasing but he said he said
something like if anybody in my
Administration is being an you
know they're fired immediately you just
can't be an you you know no
hostile work environment you got to go
no questions asked so Dei creates that
hostile work environment and if you're a
leader of one of these
organizations and you don't know that
Dei is creating a hostile work
environment do you know why you don't
know that what why would a leader of a
big company be unaware that Dei is
creating a hostile work environment why
would that
be how can you possibly be
unaware I'll tell you
why because it's a hostile work
environment the reason the leader
doesn't know it's a hostile work
environment is because it's a hostile
work
environment do you know who raises their
hand in a hostile work environment
nobody nobody because it's a hostile
work environment so if you say Scott
I've never heard of these claims you're
making about white men being grossly
discriminated against for 40 years do
you know why you haven't heard about it
it's a hostile work environment it's a
hostile work environment nobody's going
to tell you the truth in a hostile work
environment so there's your
truth
um well I guess Congress voted away our
privacy as if we had a uh by six votes
the
Senate uh just approved this uh warrant
list back door surveillance stuff that's
part of a bigger package I think now
there were some what I would call good
Republicans like I believe Senator Cruz
voted in favor of this Am I
Wrong didn't Ted
Cruz vote in favor of
it yeah and how about ran Paul did he
vote in favor of
it
no just trying to figure out so here's
my
question how many of
you don't trust Ted Cruz on this
question on privacy is there anybody who
doesn't trust Ted
Cruz all right that's fair he's a
politician it's always fair if you don't
trust a politician but but here's my
here's here's my problem with this story
so
far I don't really understand why so
many Republicans would favor it if it's
if the story is what we're told and
we're not missing some context how does
that really explain the number of people
who supported it here's what I
think I feel like we're not here in the
whole
story right now you know you you could
assume people are bought off and it's
corruption maybe it's a non-transparent
system in a sense so maybe but I feel
like there are too many probably good
people say probably who voted for it who
had full knowledge of you know his risks
but may have had additional knowledge
about something that we don't know
about so I'm only going to put out
there that it looks terrible it looks
terrible but I feel like there's a
little bit of the documentary effect
going on like I would like to hear Ted
Cruz sit down and explain in
detail why he voted the way he went and
I feel like we would have a different
feeling about it if we heard somebody
that you thought was generally credible
on other topics you at least you find
him credible on other topics and listen
to just listen to what he has to say so
I'm going to put a maybe on this one I
don't like giving up privacy but I'm not
sure it's that different than it ever
was I mean we never had any real privacy
so let me let me speak to you as someone
who hasn't had privacy for
forever I don't know feels about the
same doesn't feel that different but I
don't like it you know I if I could have
more privacy I would take it all
right uh tuer Carlson is quite sure that
UFOs are real or there's something up
there and he posted on X it's becoming
obvious so he says it's obvious that the
US government has made contact with
non-human
beings so why are they lying to us about
it we asked the UFO whistleblower David
or Dave grush
grush now I've asked you this before so
I know your answers you don't believe
the UFOs do
you because I don't believe him but
Tucker does now Tucker probably has way
better information than you and I have
and he believes
them I do see a few people believe it
all right here's my current
understanding of it so this will be my
opinion uh Mr grush looks like an honest
Patriot um I believe he's telling the
truth about everything he's
saying he doesn't give off any he
doesn't give off any signals for a liar
at all like if he's lying he's really
good at it but but I don't think that's
what's going on he looks like he's
telling the truth as he understands it
now did he tell you that he put his
hands on a UFO did he touch one no no he
didn't say that he says other people say
they exist has he seen some biologics as
he calls
it has he seen a you know little uh bag
of alien remains no he's been told by
other people they exist
so I think I think he's telling the
truth I think that other people said it
existed so the real question is not
whether uh grush is telling the truth
because he's not the one with the source
information you you'd have to ask other
people the other people are not
talking well there's one but you know
not the highest
credibility yeah Bob Lazar I don't put
in in the high credibility
category um and you'd want to see
multiple people with you know multiple
reports to believe something that
incredible and you'd want them to all
say the same Stuff Etc so here's what I
think I disagree with Tucker that it's
obvious we have these non-human contacts
I think it's obvious that the US wants
our average theories to think we have
them because apparently one of the
things that grush saw uh he had high
level clearance so had some part in his
work he saw um some captured
Intel that showed that one of our
adversaries he didn't say which one but
an adversary believes we have captured
aircraft UFOs so our adversary believes
we have
them so that was part of the evidence
that convinced him we do because our ad
adversaries are spying on us and they're
pretty sure we have them
so maybe their spying is a good job but
we do know that the CIA has consciously
and directly and it's in writing we've
seen it used UFO stories as distractions
for the
news so we don't have to wonder does the
CIA use fake fake UFO stories to
distract us that's given there there is
a history in it's documented you can see
the actual the actual CIA saying you
maybe we should do a UFO story to
distract
people so I would say given that uh we
don't have credible people who put their
hands on anything and you know held it
in their hand and all that and the fact
there are no good photographs and the
fact that Elon Musk says I don't think
so I think I think it's just a story
that we want our adversaries to hear
because it's free money it's free money
you know that if you're if you're in if
you're trying to protect your country
persuasion is maybe the biggest part of
it you know you need a good
military but it's not going to help you
unless you can also persuade people not
to attack you know ideally
um so it seems obvious to
me that the CIA is aware that it would
be a good thing to do to say we have it
because it gives just that little bit of
extra doubt do you know how uh Trump
said to Putin s he sort of threatened
that he would bomb
Moscow and even Trump says out loud now
he probably thought there was no more
than a 10% chance that would happen but
10% is a lot 10% is enough for you to
say you know I'm not going to take the
chance Trump says that directly that if
you can put in your opponent's mind the
doubt or at least the the idea that
you've got some superpowers or something
it's effective they only need a 10%
belief they don't need a lot of belief
so if you could make Russia and China
think there was a solid 10% chance that
we had Advanced you know Alan
technology you don't think that would
affect their uh their War plans of
course it would even if it's only a 10%
chance of being true yeah just like
Moscow all right so I think it's obvious
that we don't have this unless we're
keeping it with those secret Sonic uh
weapons that we used on the embassies
you maybe we keep them all together with
the the Russian supersonic
weapons all
right um how many attacks on Elon Musk
are there now let's see NBC is uh
telling us that the Cyber truck
according to experts uh because it's a
big heavy truck could really hurt
pedestrians and occupants of lighter
vehicles if they hit
it yeah that's a story that was just
begging to be told wasn't it the a truck
is heavy
story do do you know what's also heavier
than a
Prius every truck every truck every
single
truck they're all bigger than a Prius
yeah did does this look like an
important story and nobody could have
figured out that a truck just just look
at the Cyber truck you don't think you
could tell that would hurt your car if
it if you hit it I think you could tell
but it's not just NBC as uh um as others
have pointed out who else let's
see
um let's see we've got uh as Brendan
Carr said we've got the these are the
entities that are going after mus the
doj FAA FTC nlrb
uh the southern district in New York and
the FWS whatever they are and then
NBC now some say the NBC is just a a
government Intel entity the NBC people
say is the one that just tells you what
the government told them to say is sort
of their outlet for fake news so you got
NBC which I just put as a government
entity it's basically a Democrat entity
at this point um so NBC D OJ F FTC nlrb
sdny and F FWS whoever they are who's
the
FWS FWS somebody tell me what that is
why don't I know what that
is
SEC or are you saying that also the
SEC all right well some government
agency I guess
so
it's not our imagination right Joe Biden
did say at the podium he said out loud
um how would they get back at Elon Musk
and president responded there's a lot of
ways to invest not get B him he was
asked you know whether he would be
investigated and he said there are a lot
of ways well here are all the ways I
mean it's pretty clear that uh Biden has
weaponized government against one
citizen because as CI has a uh
essentially rescued free speech and free
speech is really dangerous to the Biden
Administration so it's not my
imagination right this is 100% obvious
that your government is weaponized
against at least Trump and at least musk
and I would argue that they're
weaponized against me and a lot of
people who are on social
media so we've seen the splc weapon
onized against people the ADL weaponized
against oh and the ADL weaponized
against musk now when I when I mentioned
these government entities I didn't
mention the
ADL but should
I so let's see the ADL let's see if I
have this right I don't know if I have
this right does the ADL take any funding
from
Soros does anybody know that do Soros
fund the ADL at
all right well if he
does uh or or let let's let me be more
General whatever Soros funds is
effectively the Biden Administration
funding it because he's also the biggest
funer of the Biden Administration the
Democrats so if you're saying that the
ADL is a non- government organization
well that's technically true but it's
also true that the main fun of the main
you know people running the
country is funding both or I don't know
if it's C ADL but some people are saying
so so to say that Soros is not part of
the
Democrat Administration is only
technically true but he operates like he
is so I I feel like making that
distinction is not exactly Fair he he's
basically the Democrats
all right um there's a report that I'm
not sure anybody believes that Russia
has lost almost 90% of its pre-war Army
according to us intelligence
315,000 Russians killed or injured uh
the key word is pre-war Army
pre-war so if you read this quickly
you'd say 90% of their army is
gone but that's not what this say says
90% of the pre-war number so they they
had a smallish relative to now smallest
Army that they turned quickly into a
largest
army the 90% is of what they used to
have it's not 90% of what they have now
you know to me this looks like
propaganda to help the funding of
Ukraine because it makes Ukraine look
like they're winning so here here's some
of the argu ments that Ukraine has made
for why they're winning they say they're
controlling the sea in the area the
Black Sea so that they kind of won
that and I'm
thinking kind of yeah they made it they
did make it too dangerous for Russia to
be in that area and I think they're
getting some of their weat out but
that's not like the biggest win in the
world and then he also said I may have
gotten this one wrong but I think what
he said to zalinski is that one of of
the big wins is that the Wagner group
kind of got disintegrated and the Wagner
group was Russia's uh wedge in other
countries so that that Russia will going
forward have less of a way to control
other third world countries with their
Wagner Group H I kind of suspect the
Wagner group will be
reconstituted maybe after the war so I
don't know if that's a big deal but you
had to uh you had to zinsky had to
reached pretty far to get a victory
there didn't
he that's quite a stretch to say you're
winning that you control the ocean which
is not
Ukraine and you've done a good job of
protecting Africa from the Wagner
group that's that's really favorite
story of the day is that Trump says he
took a got a physical and he took a
cognitive exam and uh he said quote but
I took a cognitive exam and I aced it
all right he aced
it he aced it now didn't you laugh when
you heard
that why is it only funny when Trump
says
it because you know he's
bullshitting but he bullshits in such an
obvious way that it just makes it part
of the joke yeah it's on brand if if you
had heard if Trump had said anything
except he had aced the cognitive
test it wouldn't be
Trump like this is why I like
him it's because he says stuff like this
that just makes him irresistible to
people like me like I just love the fact
that he said it it doesn't matter if
it's true I don't care I really don't
care if it's true the fact that he said
it and the way he said it is just so
trumpy there's no nobody can you just
can't match
whatever it is he has that X Factor you
just can't touch it he just is so
singular you know I remind you that uh
I'm still endorsing
vake but uh Trump has game let's
say um and he he says that everybody
who's President we running for president
should be forced to take a cognitive
exam I don't know about that but I do
think it's good politics to say it all
right an interesting legal thing
happening that I don't fully understand
but I'll do my best so one of the J
Sixers uh got his case all the way to
the Supreme Court and the question the
Supreme Court will handle is if there's
really a thing like obstructing an
official
proceeding because apparently the laws
about obstructing an official proceeding
or or obstructing yeah were created
specifically about destruction of
documents so if the government had asked
for some documents but you destroy them
you're obstructing their proceeding by
destroying the documents but um
destroying documents has nothing to do
with January 6
however um some of the language of
January
6 um
suggests that it could include
proceedings you know obstructing a
ongoing proceeding now the original
context was destroying documents but
there is some general language that
seems maybe non-document
related so here's the
importance if the Supreme Court rules
about this one January 6 person who got
convicted and says oh yeah that rule
didn't really apply to this situation or
could say they didn't really delay it
because you know nothing could have
really stopped it or they could say well
the only thing they delayed was the
ceremonial
part I don't know maybe that's something
um I don't know if there's enough there
my my non- lawyer take on it
is I it's it's not obvious that the J
Sixers is going to win this it's not
obvious to me but they could I think
it's in the realm of possib
ility that they could now if one j6 wins
it in the Supreme Court I assume that
has huge implications for all the other
J Sixers except for the violent ones the
violent ones are in for the violence as
well but it would have you know of
course tremendous implications for Trump
himself because how could Trump obstruct
something if there's you know no valid
law that says that's a a
problem all right so if you want to hear
a better explanation that I would go to
uh go listen to a
lawyer um speaking
of so so here's the exact sentence see
if this see if you think this
applies um so it would be illegal to
quote this is from the law to otherwise
obstructs influences or impedes any
official proceedings or
attempts um to do that and you'll be
find an in prison if you do that now I
guess the Supreme Court would have to
look into what is any official
proceeding because here's the
problem that would apply to everybody
all the
time aren't people always trying to
impede official
proceedings isn't every protest trying
to impede it what how do you how do you
define
impede what what is enough action that
you've impeded it and let's say let's
say if you knew that the most you're
doing the the worst they could do is
delay at a
day if you have a protest that says we
definitely do want to do this government
uh official proceeding now we're not
trying to stop it we're trying to make
sure it was done
right all right you're the Supreme Court
and somebody comes to you with this
argument the protesters didn't ask to
stop it forever
they asked to make sure it was being
done right is asking or demanding that
something be done right in other words
to check anything that could be checked
is demanding that something to be done
right and then done the same as stopping
it if I'm the Supreme Court I say no
that's different if they were trying to
stop it forever maybe you'd have
something there but if the explicit
demands were to delay it just just long
enough to check the government would
have been fine under that circumstance
the government would have just you know
take the long until they found out then
they would have certified it so if I
were the lawyer I would argue that there
was no real chance of it being delayed
indefinitely and that whatever delay
they were asking for was trivial and
therefore this doesn't
apply and if I'm the Supreme Court I I
Ki it out and free Trump all
right so Trump is leading in all seven
swing States according to polls and uh
rasmason has a real jaw-dropper are you
ready for
this brand new rasmon
poll Trump just opened a 10-point
lead 10-point lead this brand
new 10-point lead so he leads an all
seven swing
States and I believe he he wins even in
a national vote which normally the
Republicans lose even if they win in the
uh Electoral College he has the most de
he has the most commanding lead that I
think I've ever seen maybe I don't have
a memory of anybody having this much of
a lead at this
point may maybe there's precedent for it
I don't know probably
is
so he's at his strongest point and uh
Jack Smith his prosecutor appears dead
set and trying to make sure that he has
to sit in trial because apparently the
nature of the trial requires his
presence for the entire trial while it's
in court so Trump would have to take
massive time out from campaigning to
literally just sit in court and you know
well they tell him he's
guilty now to me it's very obvious that
the government is weaponized against
Trump this is purely
political these charges wouldn't have
happened except for Trump and that it's
exactly what it looks like they're
trying to put him in
jail because beating him at The Ballot
Box appears to be impossible appears
impossible so as Trump's lead grows it
is now beyond the margin of
cheating that's a big deal
cuz if Trump were were so close to Biden
that if they could cheat I'm not saying
they will I'm not saying they ever
have but if you got it close it would be
at least tempting to cheat to put Biden
Over the Top If it's close because you
could get away with
it it's not
close so if it's not close the option of
you know tweaking a little bit to put
Biden the head isn't going to work so
what are they going to do the Democrats
if they can't beat him in The Ballot Box
and they can't even beat him by rigging
The Ballot Box because it would be too
obvious what are you going to do
remember they've already told themselves
and all of their a base that he's
literally
Hiller he's a dictator who's going to
take away all your freedoms what are you
going to do well if you can't put him in
jail which would look at least like a
legal process what are you going to
do do you know how the Biden
Administration has refused RFK Jr's
security detail even though it's super
obvious the RFK Jr needs security super
super obvious and it's even been pre
there's a President Obama got early
security do you think they'll take
Trump's security
away as ridiculous as that sounds what
else do they have left because they have
to stop him and they're not going to
want to kill him themselves right that'd
be a little too on the nose but they
might want somebody else to do it
they've certainly weaponized the public
by by saying he's Hiller so uh I'm not
going to predict that they take away his
security detail but what are they going
to do so we're we're creating a
situation
where they either have to do something
massively illegal or they have to
replace Biden right
away and it looks like the it looks like
they're working on all counts looks like
the Democrats are trying to be prepared
for all
situations ideally it's pretty clear
that the Democrats in general would like
to push Biden out of the job so they're
it's obvious that they're pushing and
pushing and
pushing it might even be the reason
reason that people are answering the
polls the way they are it might be the
Democrats are just answering that they
won't vote for Biden to give him the
extra push but they would vote for you
know any other Democrat so that doesn't
guarantee that Trump's going to win just
because he's ahead of
Biden you you stick any other Democrat
in there and it's going to flip
immediately I think so the most likely
possibility is they're going to keep
pushing Biden to
resign but what whatever it is that's
keeping Biden in the race I don't know
what it is I think it's to protect
himself and his family that's what I
think but that won't
change so imagine if you
will Trump offer to Pardon
Biden if he drops all the
charges can you imagine uh Trump
offering to pardon the bidens or just or
just Hunter
or just
Hunter it would put Joe Biden in a
awkward position wouldn't it now I think
the Republicans wouldn't like to hear it
they they wouldn't like to hear Trump
say he might pardon Biden or Hunter
because you know it wouldn't work the
other way right so you say oh no take
every Advantage fight every way you can
destroy them completely you know a lot
of Republicans would say that but just
think about how clever it would be for
Trump simply to make that off
CU it would just it would just throw
them into a you know chaos because
they'd think about
it but I don't think Trump wants Biden
to leave the race do you I mean Biden's
his the most beatable person at this
point so I think that Trump wants to
keep him in the race and uh he'll act
that
way all right and the the change in the
uh arment in poll is tremendous so the
the Trump up by 10 is a reversal from
just one month ago when Biden led by
Four
Points one month ago Biden won by four
points and now Trump's up by
10 same methodology I think same
methodology it should
be all
right
um so Hunter was asked to uh show up for
a closed
door um hearing or deposition or
something whatever they're going to call
it for congress but instead of attending
it he went to the location and gave a
gave a little speech to the reporters
saying that he'd be happy to do it but
only if it's a open
door now I said that he
won um and I'm going to
disagree at my
Peril uh with Jonathan
Turley yeah I invented what I call the
turly test it's like a a play on the
touring test so the tly test is uh tly
is usually right on the legal stuff so
if you disagree with him you're probably
at your peril right so if you disagree
with him or dwit or somebody just know
you're being stupid CU he's going to be
right about the
law having said that now going to be
stupid um because turle says that Abby
LEL who is the attorney for uh Hunter uh
he said he this is according to turle
that ABY L just stage the worst possible
Optics he yeld oppressor just steps away
from a committee waiting to hear from
him hunter that is I cannot imagine the
legal rationale for such a stunt it is
virtual legal self
imulation
um and said and then toly said he should
have just said invoked his right to
remain
silent um I'm going to
disagree I'm going to disagree so first
of all I think you agree that Hunter's
lawyer is he's playing the the court
system but also the public opinion right
the the lawyer is juggling two things
public opinion is really really good to
matter in this case but also the legal
part here's what here's how I felt about
it all right I'll just tell you how I
felt Hunter made me agree with him
totally totally persuaded me I watched
him say I I'll be happy to do this if
you do it um
transparently and then he spoke my
language he said it's a government
process I would be happy to do it if you
can all watch sold sold stop talking
sold
right because I don't care if it's the
Republicans I don't care if it's
comr I don't care who it is if you're
going to do it behind a closed door with
somebody who says I don't want to do it
behind a closed door I want to do it in
public because I don't trust you I am on
Hunter's side so hard so hard totally on
his side yeah now here's what many of
you said when I said this on X you said
Scott you don't get it if it's public
it's going to be one of those show trial
things where everybody gets five minutes
and then he just runs out the
clock
what no that's not what I heard what I
heard was he wants to do the process
that they said they want to do but
publicly I didn't hear I didn't hear him
say he wants to have all the people ask
him 5 minutes a piece I heard him say do
what you want to do exactly the way you
want to do it and let every everybody
watch that's what I heard did you hear
him say I don't want to answer questions
from a well-qualified you know one
person did you say it needs to be public
but also in addition to being public did
he say it should be everybody only has
five minutes to talk to me he didn't say
that now if there's some kind of weird
rule I don't know about that says if
it's public everybody has to give five
minutes I've never heard of that
so am I wrong that all he asked for was
public he didn't ask for it to change
the format to everybody gets five
minutes he didn't ask for
that what am I wrong about don't say I'm
wrong say what I'm wrong
about you so you're telling me that if
it's public everybody gets five minutes
and there's just and and there's nothing
they can do about it that's
stupid that's stupid no comr they can
could do anything they want they could
have one person ask all the questions
which I assume is what they were going
to
do so whether it's a committee meeting
or one
person all Hunter said is let people
watch he he did not say change the
change the standard of how the questions
would be
asked I I feel like you're experiencing
some cognitive dissonance here because
you want Hunter to be wrong and guilty
and bad in every
way how about how about Hunter has some
real issues he needs to
explain but that he's not completely
always wrong and bad about every single
thing we can't allow that can't he be
totally right about
this now here's partly why I um I'm
backing him on this because it's what I
would have done that's exactly what I
would have done so here's why I think
Abby Lowel may have played it
correctly Hunter went physically to
roughly where they wanted him to be that
showed the committee that it was not a
physical limitation that physically he
was willing to do it and then he told
the public of the entire world I'm
willing to do this I'm willing to do
this and I'm even here just turn the
cameras
on I think he won
100% I I think that was Absol
absolutely a great play so I I agree
with his lawyer and now uh turle is
being um specific when he says it's a
legal self-
imulation so turle is not saying
directly that the public relations part
is good or bad he's saying from a legal
perspective you know puts him in a
little extra
Jeopardy and and people said hey if
other people could be uh arrested like
Bannon for refusing to uh to talk why
can't why isn't Hunter immediately
arrested why see I handcuffed to which I
say damn it make me don't make me defend
Hunter
again Bannon said he wouldn't do
it Hunter said I would totally do this
and I want everybody to see it those are
not the same those are not the same I'm
not going to talk to you yes I will talk
you and I want everybody to watch those
are
opposites those are direct opposites so
I don't want to hear the Bannon
example
right and banon Bannon was arguing some
privilege or something right yes so
there was that was a different situation
yeah don't compare it to banon that's
completely different so you know I I
hate to be in a position where you know
I'm the one defending a hunter how did I
get here
and and see this is what I really
 hate I really hate that I tell
you something that you don't disagree
with one bit and I see some here
saying that I've lost the step why why
because I don't want to throw a citizen
of the United States under the
bus Hunter is first a citizen of the
United States first don't lose that
why are you losing that don't lose your
Humanity just because you want to
win all
right uh apparently open AI has
announced they're going to have a new
partner for their news so they've
they've got a new strong partner so if
you use chat GPT going forward it'll be
pulling from some specific new sources
so that's good news right chat GPT will
have some like fresh news sources
I don't see any problem with that do
you go ahead what what could the
possible problem with that be oh you're
asking what the sources are how do that
matter how do that matter oh okay let's
check the
sources um let's see it's a some news
entities owned by somebody named Axel
Springer so apparently he
owns uh let's see what's he own
uh Business Insider uh
I and welt I think those are some U
German Publications does he own
Politico does he own
Politico I see this in the note but I
didn't know that
anyway so
um what do other people say about that
well Mike Ben points out the Axel
Springer is a longtime recipient of CIA
support for his media Empire
overseas so chat GPT will be using a new
source owned by someone who is
known to be kind of friendly with the
CIA in the past now the CIA connection
is is pre passed so um it would not be
unusual for the CIA to help some news
entity get created and get successful if
they feel have some influence on it
so is it starting to look let me back up
and and state something
obvious let let me say something that I
want you all to say that's obvious
that's obvious there's no way the CIA
can let AI just operate without their
influence you agree there is no way no
way the CIA can let AI develop just on
its own organically where well wherever
it ends up hey you know could be a
threat but wherever it ends up that's
fine no if the CIA is doing their job
they have already corrupted Chad
GPT does the CIA do their job
well apparently yes apparently they do
yeah would would this be hard for them
would it be beyond their capabilities to
get functional control of a tech company
would that would that be hard for the
CIA nope probably be the easiest thing
you could ever do well do you know what
you can do if you can find out what
anybody has done
digitally imagine that you could find
out what the CEO or even the top
Engineers of any company you can find
out everything they've done
digitally you don't think you can
control them if you know everything that
they've done digitally of course you can
you could literally control any citizen
by knowing all the things they've done
digitally and if they're political
people or high-tech billionaires and
stuff well you even have more stuff to
work with you there's going to be more
juicy stuff in
there so can you imagine any situation
in which the CIA had ever said you know
we're going to we're going to set this
one out let's just see how it
develops I hope not that would be very
much not their job their job would be to
you know protect the country if they
think AI would drive the country apart
in some way they should absolutely be
looking to figure out how to get a lever
on it in case something goes wrong or in
case they need to use it or in case they
need to tweak it so that somebody in
another country is getting the America
approved ver verion of of the truth of
course they have to co-opt it of course
let me ask you this do you think Google
search results are entirely the way they
are because only Google has decided
internally you know what is right and
what is wrong what priorities
and you don't think the
CIA had a
absolute you know mission to at least
have the ability to change search
results
I can't imagine much that would be more
important than that because you'd want
the search results at least in other
countries to be
pro-american maybe subtly but
pro-american they're not going to let
they're not going to let a search Edon
say a bunch of non-american embarrassing
stuff in other
countries if they can prevent
it so I would assume that any kind of
major search engine would be subject to
intelligence operative
control any doesn't matter what company
is so does this look like it more of
that it looks exactly like more of that
it looks exactly
like what you would do if you're working
with a CIA that doesn't mean they
are I'm just saying it looks exactly
like it and you should expect it so when
something looks exactly like what you
should have expected it to look like in
any logical World in which things work
the way they always work it's probably
exactly what it looks like probably
don't know can't read
mins all right uh there's a uh survey of
Palestinians to find out how many of
them supported the massacre by Hamas now
this is not a survey of just
Hamas this is a survey of the
Palestinians in the
area how many do you think supported the
the
massacre now we're not talking about
supporting mos in a general way we're
talking about specifically supporting
the
massacre
72% 72%
of Palestinians just the
civilians uh are okay with Hamas
massacring and murdering Israelis on
107 does that sound about right now
that's the number we've heard before I I
had heard that the Palestinians were
about 70% in favor of Hamas I had not
heard that it was still the case after
107 and after the destruction of Gaza
but it
is and as David boxen horn um said don't
feel sorry for Gaza they think it was
worth
it damn
it damn
it that's exactly my opinion that is
exactly my
opinion that by an overwhelming
majority they're glad it
happened and if they're glad it
happened presumably they're looking at
the whole picture they're not looking at
just in isolation presumably when they
answer the question they're talking
about all the trouble that caused as
well as what it did and the attention it
got and the response as
well so honestly
um you know as a as a human being I
don't want to see any innocent people
get
killed so nobody's in favor of you know
War for the sake of
War but how am I supposed to show
empathy for a group of people who are
getting what they
want I have empathy for people not
getting what they want they're very much
getting what they want as a as a whole
now this still leave GES you know
substantial number of people who didn't
want any of it and those people I
especially want to be safe but wow it is
really hard to show some empathy in this
situation if they got what they wanted
that see the and I've said this
before if you're fighting an enemy who
wants to kill you that's a normal
situation so we we can all deal with
that oh we want to kill you you want to
kill us that's that's War but when
you're fighting an enemy who wants to
kill you but also wants to
die and wants their own civilians to die
and worse their own civilians are
willing to die to get whatever the goals
are how do you fight that you don't
fight that you treat it like a
virus right now I'll say this a million
times until everybody agrees sooner or
later you're always going to agree with
me they're not fighting a war of
people it's not a people War it's a
virus there there's a mental virus that
is apparently affected not just the
fighters the terrorists but also the
public that supports them so you don't
fight a virus by killing everybody
because you can't you do it by
quarantine so I keep hearing people talk
about what's going to happen to Gaza
afterwards how about
depopulated I think obviously it's going
to be depopulated you never going to see
the Palestinians uh running it so do you
think the Palestinians are going to be
flowing back in to be under more Israeli
occupation and more
Hamas no there there's no way Israel is
going to let Gaza rebuild that would be
stupid so what did they do with all the
displaced people
well 72% of them are happy with it
so if they if they act like they don't
care understandable all right so there's
this new Civil War movie what called
Civil War movie and uh have you ever
heard of predictive programming so this
is a dirty trick persuasion technique is
to Prime you to put your brain in a
certain state
so that the later messages will go right
in right so if you create a
narrative uh people are very narrative
story bound so as soon as if they have
any narrative in their head all
information sticks to one of the
narratives it doesn't just float around
and then you make sense of it it just
sticks to a frame so if somebody creates
a new frame and really gets it into the
public that really
really their later persuasion will stick
to the frame so this Civil War movie um
the plot is that California and Texas
join teams and there's a civil war
against the rest of the
country now I know what you're saying
Scott Scott Scott this is a stupid
narrative because one thing we know for
sure is that California and Texas are
never going to join teams one's blue
one's red that's crazy it's crazy Scott
doesn't matter the that detail of who's
on what side not relevant what's
relevant is they put in your mind a
movie physical visual version that
you'll think about like the Matrix like
the Matrix like uh soil and green right
if you see a story about a new food
source that's not a normal food source
how long does it take you to say soil
green soily
green that's predictive programming so
because the movie had so much control of
your head you see any story about a new
food source and people will just start
writing in the comics soil and green I
hope I'm the first one to say soil and
green did anybody else did anybody else
say soil and green
yet and then you know then I I want to
go shoot myself stop saying soil and
green if uh Andrew Tate is selling his
message he will mention the Matrix 50
times why the only reason t can mention
the Matrix and it all makes sense is
because you've got the Matrix in your
head and the Matrix not literally so
right when when Andrew Tate says we're
in The Matrix he does not mean that
we're really bodies and Vats like the
movie he means that the thing we're
being presented with as reality is
actually artificial and there's a a real
reality behind it now he can say that in
a short hand because the Matrix kind of
explain that kind of a concept so this
new movie this Civil War movie is really
really hard for me to see this as a
coincidence when the narrative that the
Democrats want to sell and I'm sure it
was made by democrats The Narrative they
want to sell is that there's a risk of
Civil War in the country because that
makes Trump look dangerous and it makes
all the more reason you're going to have
to put him in jail because you want to
avoid that Civil War what Civil War well
like the movie just like the movie and
then somebody says but in the real world
California and Texas not they said no no
no right not those States but certainly
the red States versus the blue States
right so it is predictive programing
whether intentional or not I don't know
but boy it's a big
coincidence and that ladies and
gentlemen is everything I wanted to tell
you about
today probably the finest live stream
you'll ever see is there anything I
missed yes I missed how's the stock
market doing today it's up stock market
is Raging rumbles up almost 9% whoa
campe World up
8% Bitcoin pulled back a little bit but
it's way high Apple's looking good the
S&P index 500 up a little bit and even
Israel's up Israel's stock is uh sort of
up to where it's been hovering for a
number of years but it's not
low all right does the stock smike Spike
give you dopamine it
does it does that's why I look at it I
my
uh my technique for checking my stocks
is only when the Market's up that's my
rule if if the market you know just goes
in the toilet it stop looking because
the stocks I have I I hold them because
they're good for the long term they're
they're not susceptible to a temporary
downturn so the moment it goes negative
I don't look and and I wait for the news
to say stuff like oh it's regained its
territory since whatever and like oh
we'll see and be because that allows me
to hold my
stocks because I'm reinforcing the
holding was a good idea if I start
looking at when it goes down that works
against my discipline of knowing that
holding it for the long term is going to
be the better idea so I don't
check uh Kramer says
recession
good as people often say he's a counter
indicator
um Disney will lose copyright on black
and white Mickey Mouse in two weeks no
way really uh because that was was that
a 75 year thing 75
years did I guess
95 they had a 95 year
copyright is it really 95
years wow that is a standard 95 I
thought it was 75 but just going for a
memory so 95 they say um uh the life of
the Creator plus 28 years somebody
says it was extended at one point I
remember
that okay Google lost a lawsuit about
Monopoly in the app store oh that could
be
interesting somebody says my commentary
improved since I got divorced I don't
think it's
related you know what I think it is I
think we're just entering an election SE
season I think my commentary has more
salience as as a presidential election
approaches so I think that's what it is
dur during the pandemic I was useless to
most of you wouldn't you
agree yeah during the pandemic I was
largely useless to most of you because I
wasn't agreeing with you as much as you
wanted during the pandemic everybody
just wanted just agree with me okay just
 agree with me that's all I'm
asking you to do and I tried I tried to
do the uh you know show the the pro and
the
cons nobody wanted to hear
that let me give you an
example no I'm not going to do it I
don't want to talk about
it uh Annie McCarthy's idea that
Democrats were using the indictments to
bait Republicans into
nominating uh
well um I agree with the theory that
Democrats are getting are trying to get
Republicans to
overreact I think Republicans are being
pushed to overreact like January 6 so
that they can sell their narrative that
you know there's a Civil War and all the
all the magga people are bad and white
supremacists and stuff like that but
here's what I think I feel like
Republicans are too
smart which is not something I say a lot
but don't you feel like the activist
Republicans have totally figured out
that if they give physical it's
bad
right haven't they figured that
out um however if Trump ever actually
spent a day in the physical
jail I don't know what would
happen like you know I'm not going to
incite any viol
because that's you know that would be
falling into the Trap but you put Trump
in jail for one day like actual prison
one
day I cannot predict what would happen
so I don't think he's jailable I've said
this before I believe he's physically un
jailable at this point because the
system couldn't handle it the system
would just
break yeah if you want to destroy the
entire Republic put him in jail for one
day that that would be the biggest
existential threat to the country we've
ever had in my
opinion but we'll see we shall see all
right that's all for today YouTube we'll
talk to you tomorrow thanks for coming
you're
awesome
