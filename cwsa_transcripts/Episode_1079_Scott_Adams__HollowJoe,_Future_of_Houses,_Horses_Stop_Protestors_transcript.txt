oh look at this
got chocolate on my face what the hell's
up with that
sometimes i use my ipad as a little
mirror
well there we go now
i know what you're thinking you're
thinking to yourself
what a great morning but it's even
better than you think
starting out slow but just getting
better all day
and one of the ways that it's going to
get better is to
kick it off right if you get it started
right
well everything goes well after that and
what would you need
hypothetically to start your day off
really really well what would it take oh
i don't know
maybe a copper a cupper mug or a glass a
tanker gelser stein a canteen jugger
flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes
everything better pandemics unemployment
crime you name it it's a simultaneous
sip
join me now
wow i don't know is it my imagination
or does it get better every time i think
it does
so um story number one
no one cares about athletes kneeling
nobody gives a darn
do you remember when kaepernick started
off the
the kneeling thing and it was a it was a
big
you know national story and the
president weighed in and we couldn't
stop talking about it
it's really different now isn't it
it's almost like those are completely
separate things
because when kaepernick did it i said to
myself
you know if i'm being objective i always
say good things about president trump's
persuasion talents and i'll say it about
the other team as well
aoc very good for example
and kaepernick in my opinion very
very effective for what he was trying to
get done which was raise attention etc
and the fact that it was inappropriate
and that it offended the sensibilities
of lots of people
was what made it a good protest nobody
got hurt
you know there was no physical damage
there was no violence
no laws got changed he simply did
an act which lots of people found
gross which is why he got attention
which is why it worked
but that was then and do you see what's
really really really different about now
what's different is that was the worst
thing that was happening at the time
things were so good relative
relatively speaking compared to 2020
things were so good
that we had the luxury of arguing and
fighting with each other
about nothing just nothing
now i'm not saying that the issue is
nothing the issue is a thing you know
it's
it's certainly worthy of attention and
you know the best resolution we can get
to have the safest
policing situation that we can have for
everybody of course
but it was also it just seemed big
because life was sort of going along all
right we just had the luxury of
complaining about politics it was sort
of a sport
but now we're in the middle of a
pandemic an economic
calamity of some sort i think we'll get
over it but
at the moment when you see everybody
kneeling
when you see entire teams do it does it
register a little differently
at this point it's moved from this
kaepernick
you know a plus persuasion thing even if
you didn't like it
to more of a performance art sort of
situation
wouldn't you say it feels more like a
theater
so when you see all the people uh
kneeling well let me
put it in this frame when kaepernick
kneeled
or knelt and a few others did and it
wasn't that many
it was obvious that this was an insult
to the flag would you agree
it was obvious that the intention
was to insult the flag to get some
attention
for for a good cause i think
but when everybody does it it doesn't
look like that anymore to me
and i think that other people would have
the same impression i don't want to make
the universal
what i call the the number one problem
with understanding reality
if there's one biggest problem we all
have
it's imagining that other people think
the way we think
and then the world doesn't make sense
but people are
really different so i'm going on a limb
and thinking that
most people will have the same
impression that i'm describing that i'm
having
which is when a few people protest they
are insulting your flag
and if you take that personally well
that's the point
that's the point you're supposed to take
it personally
that's why it works but when everybody
does it
that doesn't feel personal anymore to me
and it also and here's the key
it doesn't feel aimed at the flag
it doesn't it feels when everybody does
it
because they're not activists they're
just people trying to
you know get along and do do what they
think is right and the best thing they
can do
and get along with their teammates and
not cause trouble
you know it really is more about
solidarity with the
the point that there's something that
needs to get fixed
so i think when you take it from the few
people to everybody doing it it no
longer is about the flag
it's no longer really about the country
it's really about the problem
and if you don't see that shift from i
hate your flag
to all right we're all on board let's
just look at the problem
you know let's let's support the you
know the the thought and the energy
behind it
so um i was asked online whether
whether that would be an impact on the
election
and in my opinion it will have no impact
on the election
um because all of the other things are
just so much bigger
and this morphed from something edgy
into something that's more like theater
and not really
not important in any way the issue is
important but not the way they're doing
all right um the president is
claiming that we'll have maybe
400 more 400 miles of border fence
built by the end of the year how long is
the border
the border 2 000 miles
and i don't know how much of that
already head fence and how much is
replacement defense you know because
we live in a world in which all data is
wrong
so so i'm not going to apply that just
to the other
you know the other team but all data is
wrong
so when you hear that there's 400 miles
of fence built
well what's that mean how much is
replacement how much is new
how much is in the places we needed it
most i mean really
you just can't trust any data in 2020
but it's a big number whatever it is
it's hundreds
hundreds of miles and if i had to
if i had to look at the president's
performance
toward his really i'd say his key
campaign promise
which was border security at the end
well let's say by november what are you
going to think about it
because here's here's my take on it
the president has done maybe better than
any president has ever done
at saying this is what i'm going to do
and then
actually doing it um you could argue
that those things should not be done
that's what the democrats would argue
but i think we're actually
past the point with this president
where people could legitimately say he
promised he would do this
but he didn't do it now i would say
health care is still a big looming
hole and he's even done at least
something with that with the
pharmaceutical
stuff and that could that could be huge
actually but i think he's you know
a little short on the health care stuff
but did he try to and successfully
remove the
mandate yeah he did did he try as hard
as he could
to end obamacare to
to turn it into something else i think
yes
so even when when he maybe didn't get
everything that you thought he wanted
such as
immigration and healthcare it does look
like he's
he's taking big swings at it it does
look like the energy's there it does
look like
the intention is there there there's
nothing about any of these things that
would suggest
they were false promises it looks like
stuff he meant
and stuff he's at least trying to do now
if you're uh
ann coulter you're a better critic of
his immigration stuff
because it hasn't hasn't been completed
hasn't been done
well enough and that's true
but in november
who would you trust to get it done would
you trust to get it done the one who
doesn't want to do it
biden or would you trust to get it done
the one who did
some of it and is clearly interested and
engaged
and cares about it etc and i think
that's trump
now i don't know if i've ever given my
own opinions about immigration
i'm not sure i actually ever have in
public but
let me give it to you this way i tend to
look at things as systems and not
goals a goal would be stop
immigration stop illegal immigration
and you can see why somebody would want
to do that
i would see it more as a system meaning
that the united states doesn't currently
have a system
that puts the citizens of the united
states and their government
in control of their own border so i see
it only as a question of
who gets to make the decision and then
secondarily
and separate from that what should be
the right decision
so i think i'm i'm a hundred percent
um adamant that only the citizens of the
united states
should get to decide who lives in the
united states
you know with their government and to do
that you need strong border security
but on top of that i would modify it
our current situation and i would say
something like this
i would say instead of us arguing about
what's the right
level let's get our economists to tell
us how much of what kind of
uh new immigration we need you know do
we need
more high trained technical people do we
need more workers
and have the economists through some
kind of process in which they say you
know the
unemployment rate is x so maybe we
should you know
restrict immigration a little bit if you
don't have a good border security you
don't have that option
so rather than personalize it and say we
like immigrants or we don't like
immigrants which is the dumb way to do
it
everybody likes immigrants to even argue
that that somebody doesn't like
immigrants
is crazy because as is often noted we're
a country of immigrants
everybody likes immigrants one way or
another you know what however they
define it
so i would de-personalize the question
of who gets in
and make that more of a economic health
situation
because i would argue that all of north
america and all of south america
can only stay reasonably healthy if the
united states
is reasonably healthy so keeping the
united states stable has an entire
global benefit and a big part of that is
the united states being able to control
its economy
and we can't control our economy if we
can't control the border
so i would separate the questions of who
gets in let the
economist decide that not the
politicians
politicians are the wrong ones to decide
who gets in and who gets out
because that's just going to look racist
right
you know i don't have to tell you that
right if the politicians decide
who gets in and who gets out it just
looks racist
no i don't think it is that in my
opinion that's not the motivation
but obviously it's some racist
motivation
but in general it's not the motivation
uh and i think we should do a better job
of saying
look let's just turn it over to the
economists if
if our if our unemployment level is this
high
adjust your immigration you know
appropriately
and then we could tweak it as we go
because we're you know we're not
geniuses to know how the future turns
out
for those of you who subscribe on locals
the uh the platform in which i've moved
some of my
other more provocative and or
uh self-help type content
i just put up a post on there that's for
subscribers only
um on how to make conversations
with a stranger but also how to end a
conversation with a stranger you ever
get trapped in the conversation
well some some tips on locals you can
see the
link to it in my twitter profile
so i uh an article on fox news
titled 10 signs a relationship will fail
according to a new study and i looked
into it i was like
what oh this could be good wouldn't you
like to know the signs of a relationship
failing because then you'd know it's
coming and
i'm paraphrasing but here are some of
the signs
that your relationship might fail one is
you're an
to your spouse one is you don't
appreciate your spouse you treat them
poorly
you don't have sex well those are just a
few of the things
so i'm glad i read that article because
until i found out those 10 signs of a
relationship failing i didn't know that
if you mistreat your
partner it might be a bad sign
but now i know so i hope i've informed
you
don't be a jerk and
show some appreciation and maybe
you can have a real relationship
dan bongino who i would say
is well plugged into lots of stuff has
lots of sources both
on the right obviously but on the left
he tweeted this now bongino is one of
those guys where
um if a random person
said to you i've been hearing x or y
say something wouldn't you say to
yourself did you
did somebody really say that your
anonymous
friend said that but i think bongino is
such a
notorious straight shooter that when he
says he's hearing something from people
that it's real people that it actually
happened
so he says in a tweet today not a joke
and not hyperbole
i'm hearing from people close to the
situation that biden's cognitive decline
is rapidly worsening and is becoming
increasingly difficult to mask
well i think we knew that the democrats
are going to have to make a decision
soon
now the interesting part about this is
we've all been curious
what the democrats themselves are
thinking
because they're they're putting up a
pretty good front of pretending they
don't see it
but you know they do see it so haven't
you had a great curiosity about how they
talk about it privately
and you know dan bongino's reporting
that
they're talking about it privately
exactly the way you'd expect them to
all right um as uh
david bartosko said on twitter today
yesterday i think he said can anyone
honestly doubt
journalism has lost its way it refers to
a new poll
that showed that the the trust
in various segments of society has
really
shifted lately so the trust in health
care
has just gone through the roof so
what the united states citizens think
of our health care providers is is like
almost maybe even beyond military at
this point
so if you said what's our most trusted
institution i think you'd say the
military probably
uh but healthcare workers are just
looking really good
because i mean they're front line in the
war why wouldn't they
so but at the very
bottom of the list of who we trust the
the media has gone into deep negative
territory
to the point where i don't even know
if you can call it news anymore can you
is it
is it really even news it doesn't feel
like
it doesn't feel like they're trying to
make news anymore
um so i tweeted this today and this will
be your persuasion
lesson for the day so i'll tell you what
i tweeted
and then i'll tell you what the
technique is that's in it
i tweeted imagine how historians will
judge democrats
for deciding that uh hashtag hollowjoe
that's my new name for him was their
best candidate
as crazy as it seems now it will
continue bloating in absurdity
until it is one of the great american uh
wtf
you know what the f stories of all time
so here's the technique and there's some
science behind this
uh and i'll refer to one study that i
heard of long ago
if you ask people to save for their
retirement
they'll you know do do okay but they
won't do as well
as they should but if you take a
person's
current photograph and you digitally age
it
so it's what you might look like when
you're in you're
say 70 years old and then you show it to
them and say okay this is you at age 70
and then you ask them to start saving
for their retirement
they will save more because they they
saw a picture of themselves in the
future
so it is a general persuasion technique
that if you can move somebody from the
present what they're looking at and
thinking of right now
to an imaginary future then you can
prime them to head toward that future
and what i'm using is a trick
where i'm taking people out of the
present where we're
fighting the coronavirus and we've got
our own problems and we're on lockdown
and there's an election coming and
there's
a thousand news stories a day and you
know there's joe biden and he's
he's running against trump and some
people are saying he's got some
cognitive abilities but
there's so many other things what about
health care what about so at the moment
because the the joe biden thing has been
a slow
decay of his abilities you can kind of
get used to anything
if it's changing slowly so here we are
sitting here
in august 2020 and
joe biden is clearly he's just gone
you know his brain has left the building
in terms of
you know being anywhere near capable of
running the country i mean it's it's
it's just absurd at this point now if he
had started this way if the way he is in
august 2020 was exactly the way he was
one year ago we wouldn't be here
you know we wouldn't if if if he had
already been a year ago where he is
right now
we we wouldn't be talking about joe
biden he would have been
you know nothing in the primaries and
we'd be talking about somebody else
but it sort of snuck up on us you know
it's like yeah
there's one percent today as you hardly
notice
tomorrow he's maybe one percent worse
again
but you hardly notice but now fast
forward that
to 20 years from now and the historians
are writing about it
what the hell are they going to say
about this because if you get some
distance from it
and this is another persuasion trick you
can actually ask
people for example to to imagine rising
above their situation
as if they're leaving their body and
they're they're getting
higher and higher and they're looking
down at the earth until the earth is
just a little
shrinking ball as they as they back up
and it what it does is it changes your
perspective from your your small little
problems to
some kind of a bigger picture if you're
looking at
joe biden bigger picture
from the future what the hell is that
going to look like
because in 20 years people are going to
say unbelievably
in 2020 one of the candidates
was mentally incompetent and the team
that ran him
knew it they knew it and they did it
anyway
what's that going to look like in 20
years now i know
to be fair wouldn't you say that the
democrats would have said something
exactly like this
about trump before 2016.
they would have said uh what are the
historians going to say when you
elected a reality tv
you know salesman kind of a guy you know
he barely was taking you seriously
what are they going to say but of course
they were wrong
because trump actually got a whole bunch
of stuff
done you know judges and progress on the
border and fighting isis and
you know decoupling with china which is
where it needed to end up
and and it looked like he you know
we i think he's going to end up as one
of the most
the most solid presidents of all time i
think
especially if he gets a second term i i
think he'll be in the
he could be in the top five yeah you
know but it's gonna take 20 years
before anybody uh is objective enough to
say anything like that
and of course you'd have to have a great
next four years but i think you might
um so that's your persuasion trick take
take people into the imaginary future so
that they can get some kind of
a change in frame and perspective and
then ask them to look back at it and
what's it look like from the future
it's a good technique um
i noticed this morning that president
trump
retweeted something that i tweeted
yesterday
and it's always
there's some things that you can't
actually get used to
and one of them is that you wake up and
and the president of the united states
just retweeted you
it has happened a number of times now
but you never really get used to it
i i don't think i want to it's uh it's
so it's just shocking to see how
technology has made this this big old
planet so small
that you know i i can see here in my
room
you know in california just tapping away
with my thumbs on this little device
and next thing you know the president of
the united states and the white house or
air force one or wherever that key is
is looking at it and then you know he's
typing
it's just it's so wild to see how big
the world is and how small it is at the
same time
at least you know in my experience
anyway so here's the tweet that he
retweeted
um it was the one uh made by some
homicide
um group and it was uh seemed to be some
kind of pro-hispanic american group
that was pro-trump or maybe they just
made the commercial i'm not sure
but it was the one in which they talk
about biden being
essentially a racist for not considering
an hispanic vice president now
technically
technically biden has never said
that he would only pick a black vice
president
he has said he would pick a woman and i
think he's
talked about you know preference for a
person of color or something like that
but he has not uh i don't think he's
ever specified i'm gonna pick obviously
he has not
specified he would pick a black vice
president
but don't you think he kind of cornered
himself into it
because imagine if you will in the in
the midst of black lives matter
and biden being you know pretty solidly
on that team
imagine if he didn't what the heck would
that look like
i mean seriously is there any chance
that biden could
not pick a black vice president
and that that would be okay with his
base i don't think so
i think that although he has not
specifically said he's going to do that
i don't know that he has an option
so whoever he picks um you know the
smart money still says
kamala harris but uh i'm pretty sure
it's
going to be a woman i'm pretty sure that
woman will be black
i don't know that he has an option at
this point he sort of
limited himself um but anyway the
the the tweet is devastating not um
the campaign ad about being him being
racist against hispanics
it's not the ad itself that's going to
make that much difference it was the
idea
and here's the key
president trump would be on shaky ground
if he had said just on his own
hey joe biden you're being kind of
racist
for excluding you know hispanics or
anybody else from your possible vice
president picks
imagine how that would come if it would
have just been
trump and of his own mind just saying
hey
i've got an idea why don't i say joe is
a racist because of how he's
constrained his vp choices it wouldn't
really work
because it's coming from the wrong
source and people would just throw it
back at him and say well you're a racist
why'd you pick mike pence
and and also i couldn't do it it
wouldn't be something that i could just
say hey i think i'll
try to make this a thing and i'll talk
about it same reason
people would just say well you know hey
white guy
how about you stay out of this but
if a group that at least allegedly looks
like an hispanic american group
is talking about themselves that's
pretty powerful
because it speaks to feelings
and these are kind of deep ones if you
feel that you're excluded
from any kind of you know consideration
that's pretty powerful and that is the
sort of thing that moves the vote
you know athletes kneeling before a game
that's not going to move a vote we're
just so over that and it's like i said
it's just theater
but if somebody tells you there's
something that about you that you can't
change
let's say your ethnicity and we're going
to limit your access because of it
i can tell you from experience that it
doesn't make you feel good
and it would definitely change your vote
why is it that i was so anti-hillary
clinton
was it because i was so pro-trump
no it was because hillary clinton said
specifically
that women were better than men at
leadership
she said it directly she also you know
the deplorables thing
so the way i felt about her was intense
dislike which i don't have for biden
not even a little bit i have i have only
concern for biden
honestly i have just concern for him
so yeah when you insult a group about by
something they can't change
don't expect them to get over that um
i'm fascinated by the
protest strategies both as how the the
protesters themselves
are organizing and adjusting and they're
bringing their
their leaf blowers and you know they've
they've got
a whole bunch of umbrella coordinated
things
and even though it's all evil and
unproductive
i'm still kind of impressed by anybody
who's working on a system that works
better
by analogy whenever i hear a story about
a serial killer
who built an elaborate underground
bunker and you know
operated for years before getting caught
i always have two thoughts
number one oh my god that's horrible for
the victims and you know you think about
the victims and their family
but then the second thought i have very
quickly
is wow that guy's really industrious
that guy that guy knows how to do his
serial killing
let me see let me see a picture of that
bunker it seems pretty well designed
and i'm not proud of this it's just that
i can't you know not look at
technique so i look at it when the the
protesters were being
let's say effective in terms of the evil
they were trying to perpetuate
but i also uh i'm impressed when the law
enforcement
adjusts their tactics and what i saw
today
was really interesting which is the
video of in
austin there were some protesters i
don't think it got
violent in austin but the protesters
needed to be
moved or disbanded and the police used
horses so they used mounted
police officers on horses
now your first thought might be well
antifa will just you know spook the
horses or
you know slap the horses and you know
then you've got what kind of trouble
does that cause and
you know why is a horse gonna work when
a person doesn't work
and and i realized antifa probably
really likes animals
think about it don't you think that a
whole lot of antifa
and a lot of the protesters in general
don't you think there are a lot of
animal rights
people in that group just as a normal
you know
overlap with their politics and i've got
a feeling
that the things the protesters would be
willing to do to let's say
federal agents which might be a lot
what they would will be willing to do
with you know uniformed police officers
might be pretty brutal and not might be
it is
we we've witnessed the uh all the damage
um but would they hurt a horse
and when i watched i watched how easily
the horses
you know because they came as a group
when i watched how easily
they moved the protesters back i had to
ask myself is this one of the most
brilliant things i've ever seen in my
life
is this so smart that the protesters
if they turned on the horses you know if
any one of them
tried to hurt a horse what would the
other protesters do to that protester
i feel like they'd stop them in a way
that they wouldn't necessarily stop
somebody from trying to hurt a police
officer
but i think they would try to stop
somebody from hurting a horse
i don't know and i also don't know how
well
trained those horses are i assume they
have a lot of training but
um i'll just i can't say that it's the
best idea and that could be expanded and
used otherwise
other places that's to be determined
but i love i love the thought of it and
i love the
changing shifting techniques way better
than pepper spray if it works
i tweeted it yesterday that there's
this enormous enormous
economic opportunity for the united
states that is completely
unexploited and i've been pushing on
this for a while but i like the way
i finally came up with a way to frame it
and it goes like this
the cost to build a home and then to
live in it because there are ongoing
costs of living in the home
those costs are crazy um
in a world in which half of the country
can't afford it
so i i'm thinking half of the country
it's probably a bigger number
either it has trouble affording a a
single-family home
or that or they can't it's one of the
biggest problems in the country
which could also be one of the biggest
economic opportunities
so the economic opportunity would be to
figure out how to make homes
that are affordable and way better and
the way better part
is at the top right the affordable is
necessary
but i wouldn't stop with let's make tiny
homes or
let's make the same homes we're making
but use cheaper materials
nothing like that i'm talking about a
change that's as fundamental
as moving from a landline phone to a
smartphone
just skipping the flip flow flip phone
phase
entirely so our entire uh
building industry you know the
residential building
sort of evolved and i think it was
mostly contractors and engineers and
craftsmen and that sort of people and
and it sort of evolved to be
versions of what it's always been with
just small improvements
and of course that just gets more
complicated more more building codes
more more materials more design
and it's just this crazy expensive stuff
but imagine if you will some company
like uh amazon or google or an apple
whoever is really good at design
spending a lot of time just designing
designing testing testing testing
the way they would test a consumer
product you don't really do that with
a house nobody builds a house puts a
family in it
checks in with them every week to see
what worked and what didn't work how
happy they are
how they sleep how productive they are
all the things that make you
a happy person there's nobody doing that
but with a consumer item like a
phone or you know a lot of other items
there's plenty of testing
but i don't think in the housing
industry i think it's zero
and it shows so we have this big poorly
made
poorly made in terms of how well it
could be done in 2020 compared to how
well it is being done so
we do an excellent job of building an
old technology the old kind of
house what would happen if you said
and this was the nature of the treat the
the tweet what's
supposed the government said we're gonna
make it a lot easier to
rapidly prototype and rapidly test
and so if if somebody wants to propose
an area
that they want to make i called it an
experimental home
zone let's call it that that in that
zone
that all the building codes and
regulations would be
temporarily suspended and any company
that applied
could then build a home and but they
would still have to get assigned off by
real engineers
so you don't want anybody you know some
entrepreneur building a house that
hay bales and the family moves moves in
and it
smothers them so you need real engineers
to say yeah as far as we can tell this
looks pretty safe
if you keep it to single family
dwellings and especially if it's one
story
there's not really much risk of of
anybody moving in and getting hurt
and if it's entrepreneurs who want to
try new building
techniques etc there's a little more
risk
but that's how anything moves forward
with risk
so the idea so here's the idea
somebody says have you talked about joe
rogan moving to texas
that's old story so here's the idea i'm
not pitching
a specific kind of house i'm not
pitching
that we should design it or build it
with certain materials to any certain
kind of standards so i'm not talking
about what the house
looks like when it's done although
that's fun and needs to be done
i'm talking about a system at the moment
we don't have
a system to rapidly iterate and test
house designs and and one of the reasons
we don't have that
is that local building codes and local
politicians
would make that almost impossible no
they have made it impossible
so so imagine if you will there are a
bunch of experimental dwelling
zones an entrepreneur can say all right
i'll take this acre
i'll make sure engineers sign off on it
but i'm going to build my little
prototype
a few other people build some prototypes
you put some people in it
you say live here for six months we're
gonna you know we won't charge you rent
but you have to tell us your experience
you know if you went to get a broom
were you angry because you had to walk
downstairs because that's where the
broom
closet was when you tried to do your
homework
could you find a place that was quiet
that the rest of the family
you know wouldn't bother you and you
could also sit upright and have some
space
a really basic stuff you break down what
are the tasks
and how does the house handle those
tasks then
what is what is your happiness your
health
have you slept enough have you gained
weight lost weight
i mean really basic health related
things because your house
is uh programs you and by the way
one of the reasons that i uh i'm
obsessed
by house design and design in general
is that persuasion and design are really
deeply overlapping
fields so my interest in persuasion um
overlaps with my interest in
architecture and building
because persuasion is largely ignored
in that field and it's the single
biggest thing they should take care of
other than safety and cost maybe which
is
that you want to build it with the right
light
good how important is light you know if
you've got
a little vitamin d coming in and you've
got some brightness
what does that do to your mood i mean
it's completely trans
trans transformational and probably
doesn't add a lot to your house
you just have to orient it right make
sure that the sun is part of your
solution
what about the feng shui the the size of
the rooms the shape of the rooms the
furniture arrangement you know we are
on a scale of one to ten we're at about
a two
in design we could get that to attend
you know if you say that an apple
smartphone for example
is a 10 in design we're at about a two
with houses and the opportunity is
enormous
especially if you're building where
there have not been houses before
so you can actually just you know get
going
so i'd like to see some kind of
government action
to make it possible for the
entrepreneurs in the home building
business to iterate so that
the golden ratio there's somebody there
who knows their
their design the golden ratio is
in your kitchen if you're designing a
kitchen no matter how you design it
you need to maintain the golden ratio
and the golden ratio is if you can
imagine it as a triangle
in which if i have this right it's your
refrigerator
your sink and i think your your oven
your oven and cooktop and i think those
three things
have to be in a well well-designed
space you know in terms of distance from
each other
and if you get the golden ratio right
then a lot of the other kitchen
is more aesthetic so those are the types
of things that
are just insanely insanely important
in my opinion you could get the cost of
a single family house down to
twenty thousand dollars and it would be
better
than a house that would cost let's say
three hundred thousand dollars in in a
standard economy
so that that's the size of the
opportunity i think
that a twenty thousand dollar house
designed correctly
would be way better just way better
than a standard three hundred thousand
000 house in the same way
uh well forget the analogy
um likewise i think that the the ongoing
expense of living
could be reduced from i don't know
what's an average
what does an average family spend every
month for
electricity and gas and you know
that stuff i don't know insurance
yeah imagine if your insurance your
house insurance your electricity
your gas your wi-fi and all that stuff
was
100 a month could you get
a single family house that had a hundred
dollars a month
of ongoing expense from everything from
maintenance wi-fi
heating and cooling insurance i think
you actually could
i actually think you could so i think
that the future
demands that the the people who want to
be go-getters and
you get three college degrees and become
engineers and
and build products well those people can
live in their normal regular world and
pay full price for their mansions and
cars and stuff and you want you want
people to be able to do that because
that's how economies get built
but i think we have to realize that
we're heading into a future
in which i'll say half just to pick a
number for argument
half of the population especially when
the robots
take over about half of the population
is going to have to figure out how to
how to have a quality life
with a relatively low-paying job
now that low-paying job is still going
to be important
it will still have you know dignity also
meaning
it just won't be your half a million
dollar a year
job and we want everybody who has
you know the willingness to work the
willingness to be
to contribute in any way to the to the
country
to have a good life so
somebody says defund obesity i'm also
going to put on
locals my subscription based service
uh i'm also going to do a mini lesson
on how to wean yourself off of sugar
i'm working on that right now so you got
that going
um i would somebody's mentioning 3d
printed houses
3d printed houses are one of many
different
possibilities i'm personally a little
negative on 3d printed houses because i
don't know how you change them
they're kind of once they're done
they're done
i would be much more interested in some
kind of building
system that even one
person could build their own house with
you know lego-like blocks
there there may be a 100 other models uh
but
i think the 3d printed one
i don't i just don't know unless there's
also an
industry for modifying them after
they're done
so it could be that maybe you just have
to knock down the 3d printed wall
bring in your 3d printer and it you know
it builds a new room
i don't know if we're there yet but
maybe if we could get there
um i was also wondering here's a
question for you these
the 3d printers that make entire houses
you know it's this giant arm they put a
device
in the in the middle of what the house
will be it has this giant arm that
swings around in a circle
and um it prints
the walls now when i say print i mean it
basically is
is dropping a gloop of some kind of
you know concrete like substance
that hardens into the wall as it builds
up over time
and i asked myself is it will there ever
be a time
when the 3d printed home
could use as it's an ink if you will
instead of a concrete substance
could use plastic that's recycled
i mean could you could you take all the
wasted plastic
grind it up into your granules
turn it into some kind of cement-like
thing
run it through a 3d printer the
industrial size that builds houses
and just make walls out of or used
plastic
probably not i'm just sort of wondering
um somebody says they can help me get
off
vegetables you probably could
somebody says graphene is that part of
it plastic ceramics
yeah somebody says no plastic the
the gases oh okay yeah the plastic might
off gas so and i would worry about how
long it lasted
etc somebody in the comments is saying
or
rubber i was also thinking about tires
uh but i don't know somebody says it's
not the scalable
uh that i don't know
oh let me put let me uh let me give you
a little uh
architectural tip here so when i'm
riding my bike around my town i like to
look at the architecture of all the
homes and i especially like
the smaller homes the the lower cost
homes
that look good because there are a
number of homes where i live
where there'll be two homes right next
to each other
they look about the same home value
you'd probably pay about the same
but one of them has figured out how to
put let's say some veneers on the front
of their home
so they've added something that looks
like let's say a rock a rock accent
or i'm seeing in some cases like a nice
redwood
stained accent on some part of it and
those little accents could easily be
attached to the outside of any structure
so you could use let's say a base
structure to make your walls whether
they're 3d printed or something else
but then make it easy to just stick to
without without a craftsman i mean maybe
it's just plug and play
and you just take say red bricks not
not a full brick but like a just a
veneer of a red brick
and you could just attach it to the
outside of your house and make a little
accent wall or you know you know
some kind of a basically an accent
so in theory all of the
basic rooms of some new future home
could be standardized as whatever is the
best design for human living
but they would all look different from
the out the outdoors and maybe the
indoors too
because the homeowners would have the
option of just tricking them out
with a certain set of things that that
snapped to the front
so yours would look different from mine
yours might look
way better and it would just be real
easy because you're just changing the
outside
and you're just snapping it on so those
are the sorts of
somebody says they already have brick
rock panels that is correct
if you've ever tried to install any of
those
uh brick rock panels you know it takes
a craftsman i mean you have to know how
to do it you look at the youtube for
that and it's like
you gotta prep the wall and you gotta
you know there's a whole bunch of stuff
you gotta do to stick those to the wall
but what if the
what if the wall just had two holes in
it that were made for that
and you just walk up to and go and just
just stick the brick on
you know maybe you have to uh fix it in
some way that can
be unaffixed but what if you could
change it
what if in the fall you could walk
outside remove all your brick accents
from your
let's say your accent wall and put on
rocks i think i want rocks though
why not um somebody says the brick
rock panels are now much easier yeah
but they're not as easy as snap-on
snap-off
but i think they could be all right that
is
somebody says not waterproof it could be
waterproof
if the hole that you're sticking it into
does not penetrate to the inside
yeah so it could be like a like a
bowling ball hole
where it doesn't go all the way through
the bowling ball you just stick it in
the hole
now somebody's saying frank lloyd wright
yeah i saw
i just saw on youtube the other day that
frank lloyd wright
also tried to build some standardized
designs so and i think he built some uh
some standardized designs that were
meant for very low cost
homes so there are definitely a lot of
people have looked into it
all right i know that the
the building stuff is not of interest
to all of you some of you like the
politics better but i would argue
that the building industry is such a big
part
or could be even bigger part of our
economy
that it's sort of all politics and that
it would require politics
to you know clear out the codes of the
building codes etc
so that something like this could be
built um
and that is my idea for the day
anybody else have any anything to say
tankless water heaters
yeah at one point i did a project called
the dilbert ultimate house
this was years ago before i built my own
house and i
solicited the public to tell me ideas
for inclusion in the house and then i
built a number of those
ideas into my house for example
when i built my house because i got to
you know design it myself
i built a special closet for my cat
and it's off the laundry room so if you
know you can have pets
why not build a house that's optimized
for a pet
so i've got a i've got an automatic dog
door that goes down to a fenced
area with artificial turf so my dog can
let herself
out anytime she wants do her business
it's on artificial turf
in a place that i don't have to look at
too much and
i go clean it up at my leisure and
if my cat wants to use her cat box she
has her own special closet the cat box
itself is on a raised
platform so that when i change the the
litter i'm standing i don't have to bend
over to do it
and in there i've got all my cat
supplies and stuff
and it's also off of the laundry room so
i've got
venting and everything else so
that's a very very small example but if
you imagine
how much people's lives are enhanced by
pets
why wouldn't you build your house to
accommodate your pet it's such a big
part of your experience it's just
obvious i toured a house once that had a
a dog washing station some upscale house
and off uh off of one of the rooms near
the i think it was
outside the garage was like a sort of a
special shower area just to wash your
dog
and i thought well i don't know if i
need that but imagine if you did have
some kind of a
washing area in your garage it wouldn't
have to be a big garage but just a
little
little outdoor sink or washing area how
how how amazingly useful would that be
all right um maybe i'll do a special
periscopa just on
home stuff i'm actually thinking of
going around my home with my video
camera
and just photographing things that
worked and things that didn't work
to get people thinking about this stuff
all right
does snickers have her own smoking
lounge
not yet somebody says crazy white folks
you're not wrong um
yeah we're not going to talk about
hydroxychloroquine today
when is christina going to take you up
for a flight
so uh my wife christina is taking uh
acrobatic flying lessons
so uh last several days and
and uh she'll be up there today she'll
be up there and she'll be in the air in
about
two hours uh she's she's literally doing
you know barrel rolls and
figure eights over the house here so
she's having a great time
learning to uh to fly uh the small
planes for now
um let's talk about why you won't have
kent heckin lively
on or why i wouldn't have shivan yes
let me talk about that so i've developed
a rule
and it goes like this i don't want to
have
ever ever anybody on my periscopes who
is
an expert without the counter expert
unless and there's only one exception
the exception is i think i know enough
that i can ask the right questions what
you don't want
and what would serve you really really
poorly and would be a great disservice
is for me to put kent heck and lively on
just by himself now that has nothing to
do with what he says
right has nothing to do with whether
he's right has nothing to do with
whether he's wrong
has only to do with the fact that if you
wanted to mislead people that's the way
you'd do it
you would bring on one expert let them
talk
and that's it there's nothing that could
be
less healthy for understanding and
educating
and seeing the big picture than me
bringing on
one expert whose expertise i can't
penetrate enough
to ask the right questions so dr shiva
is one of those is he right is he wrong
how would i know i don't have any
expertise that would would guide me in
that area
you do not want me or anybody else
to have one expert on unless you can
also ask the right questions
and i can't so the heck of lively stuff
suppose he came
on suppose he said a bunch of things
that sounded true to you and true to me
is that good no that would be very very
bad
because you wouldn't know if there's
another argument
you know a counterpoint without that
i'm not going to do that all right and
i'm gonna try to
be uh really really strict about that
because it's one of the biggest problems
in the world and i don't want to be
perpetuating it every time you turn on
the television
you're seeing that one expert giving you
a bunch of bs
if it's on cnn they're spinning it one
way if it's on fox they're spinning it
the other way
but you don't see both you don't see the
two of them
with enough time to you know have them
work it out
so i'm just not going to be
oh my god oh somebody just said in the
comments have dr simone gold on
listen to me please
does this not make sense and am i not
clear
that i'm not going to have one expert on
that i don't know enough to ask the
right questions
now you could argue that maybe with
hydroxychloroquine i could ask the right
questions
but i already know what she said and our
and i've already
you know i've tweeted things like that a
million times
so uh
so while i believe that she would be a
compelling
guest i will not have her on without the
counterpoint
period all right um
the last thing i'm gonna leave you with
is
i cannot tell you how happy i am um
about my recent surgery on my sinuses
completely life-altering improvement
and i i just wake up happy
you know just feeling good about the
world i've never felt this good actually
uh can i have uh greg guff held on well
you know i do want to have him on i need
to
schedule that um i need to have him on
to talk about his
book the plus which apparently was just
screaming up the
the uh the best seller charts i think he
had number five or something
just just crazy president president
trump
tweeted it so i'll try to get greg on um
whenever he's available you know based
on his schedule
uh by the way greg is working on for his
book tour
since you can't do the in-person thing
that you normally would do
i believe he's actually working on a an
outdoor
drive-in theater event where people will
drive
up he'll be up on some stage or
presented on screen as well i guess and
uh that is a really fun idea so
we'll maybe we'll get pictures from that
all right
so that's it for me and i will talk to
you later
