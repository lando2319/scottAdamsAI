foreign
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization yes it's
coffee with Scott Adams and it's going
to be a rousing affair today
yes I've been putting my stick into the
stew and
stirring it up a little bit let's see if
we can get people to reveal themselves
as the NPCs they are
and uh
Clank you say yeah I just blocked sticks
and Hammer today for being the dick uh
that's another story
if you'd like to take today's experience
up a level all you need is a cup of
mugger and glass detector cells just
like the candy drink if less a vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's cold simultaneous sipco
that's good
yes I do I do block people for being um
condescending
and if they block me for the same reason
that'd be a good reason
perfectly good reason yeah sticks and
Hammer was kind of a condescending dick
to me today on Twitter
for no good reason that I could say so
I've decided to remove him from my life
forever
yes I do make decisions like that you
should just talk to some of the people
I've removed from my life forever they
will confirm that when I remove somebody
from my life forever
don't go back so he's gone forever
you may have noticed I removed my
profile picture on Twitter
that featured me in my black lives
matter shirt
because I feel like our work is done
our work is done
you know I think the whole black lives
matter thing
it had a had a role to make sure that we
valued black lives
as well as as well as we should and I
think the Brittany grinder event shows
us that we now do value black lives
higher than white lives
and that's all everybody wanted
so I feel like our work is done we can
now say with confidence that black lives
are valued by America
more than other lives so good for you
Brittany Greiner but I don't need to
wear that shirt anymore because
our work is done
um
like like to give a shout out to Mark
Cuban
you might know he's got a startup called
uh costplusdrugs.com
where I guess he's up to uh 350 types of
Pharma medications that you can get
through his online outfit
substantially cheaper than you could get
your drugs any other way I guess
so
isn't that what you want to see more of
and also to his credit
my understanding from the news anyway is
that Mark Cuban is very directly
involved you know with the company it's
not just a passive investment so there's
somebody who doesn't need to do anything
am I right did he need to do any extra
work
no yeah he hasn't need to do any extra
work for decades
but he still goes to work
and he's working on behalf of the people
of the United States in this case so
that's like that's like the best of
America right there in my opinion that's
us operating at our very best because
the free market was there
somebody who did not need to work
said well looks like I might be the
person who needs to do this because I
can
and now he's working on it now I don't
know if it'll work you know in the long
run who knows how that'll turn out but I
just want to see more of that right just
more of that so that's your good news
all right
shall we talk about the latest Twitter
file dump
what do you think
are you going to be able to handle this
all right here's what I saw
uh there's something about this
situation that is causing massive
cognitive dissonance
what is causing it for everybody it's
not just the not just the left
and
it's really fascinating a lot of NPCs
have have you know revealed themselves
you could tell the NPCs because they
have the same tells
so if I say something like the sky is
blue
the NPC will say
so you're saying your car is at a gas
now you don't have to read anything
after the word so
because that's telling you I'm in
cognitive dissonance whatever follows
the word so will be something wholly
unrelated to the conversation which I
will say is my is my dunking on you
L you got the L take the L
um
yeah
so here's here's what I think has
happened
um let's first of all talk about what we
learned yesterday from the Twitter files
some of you don't follow the news so
here is what we've learned number one
uh Trump was very aggressively
throttled before the election
so a week before the election he was
basically almost erased from Twitter
not good
uh we also know that they went after
James Woods hard
and we know that the Twitter terms of
service
were not sufficient to address all the
situations in the in the view of the
employees
and
Joel Roth and particular
seem to be in a position where he was
kind of making up the
the guidelines as he went
um would you agree that seems to be the
conclusion he was making up the
guidelines as he went
and of course the people on the right
say Well that's
that's a bad sign
nothing worse than that
making up the guidelines as you go and
always always nail in the conservatives
oh and also Breitbart Breitbart was
specifically throttled back on Twitter
which basically was a huge blow to the
business
you know breitbart's traffic was
probably mostly from Twitter until they
erased them
so so here's what we can conclude for
sure
Twitter employees were doing something
that looks like Shadow Banning so that's
that's not just a fact
interestingly I don't know if you caught
this there was no mention in any of the
documentations that we've seen yet
that suggests that Jack Dorsey was aware
of the specific actions
I'm not saying he was or he wasn't I'm
saying that no evidence has been
produced of it
now that would be consistent with the
fact that Jack Dorsey
um said publicly to
um to musk you should release all of the
documents
because if Dorsey wanted all of the
documents released
he obviously knew that it wasn't going
to hurt him
right and so so far he's so far he's
accurate now let me let me tell you all
of the bad things
that I see in terms of analysis
let's try not to take this personally
okay
number one bad analysis Jack Dorsey lied
to Congress because he said we don't do
Shadow Banning
now that's a bad analysis
because the evidence so far suggests
that we don't know
but the evidence so far suggests and by
the way musk has confirmed this as his
opinion as well
The Dorsey didn't know what was going on
at the level of these you know these
decisions which means that he would not
have been lying to Congress
he would have been telling him what he
believed was the company policy
and I think it was the company policy
like officially they didn't Shadow band
now
I suppose you you had Jack Dorsey in
front of you and you you said damn it
Jack I know you're lying
because you know that these people were
specifically looking for people and
abandoning them you know that was
happening what do you think Jack Dorsey
would say
would he say I didn't know anything
about it because he was actually on one
of the Committees that made decisions
about it now
he would say I assume I can't read his
mind but I assume he would say yeah we
have a very active
um active suppression tool and I am part
of it and we suppress people who do
things that are dangerous or against the
terms of service
then you say aha you just admitted to
Shadow Banning and then what would Jack
say probably no I just told you we do
what everybody does we get rid of things
that are dangerous and clearly bad or
illegal that's what those tools are
that's what we do
and that's not Shadow Banning
right now I'm not I'm not telling you
that it is or is not oh let me let me be
clear
for those who are a little bit maybe new
to me
I'm going to be saying some things that
sound supportive of Twitter
and supportive of your
Roth
do most of it can most of you confirm
for anybody new
that that does not mean I'm apolog an
apologist for them or that I'm on their
side
can the can those of you know me tell
the rest of the people
that I show both sides and you will not
know which side I'm taking
I'm just going to describe things if
that makes you uncomfortable this isn't
the right place for you right I'm just
going to describe things
all right now would you agree with the
following facts that nothing has been
shown yet that would implicate Jack
Dorsey
except that he said to Congress we don't
do the shadow Banning
but as far as We Know
as far as we know he wasn't aware of it
now could he be aware of it yes of
course
but that's not an Evidence
so let's just deal with what's in
evidence okay
now number two
um
was it illegal
what Twitter did
how many of how many of you think that
there was a crime
that you've detected in what has been
reported so far
anybody
okay well I have a very educated
audience because on Twitter people are
saying it's obviously a crime
and and here's what that and this is how
you know that the conservatives are
experiencing cognitive dissonance it's
both I'm going to get to the I'm going
to get to the left but here's how the
conservatives are experiencing it they
are positive they see a crime
but there isn't one
and so they're they're hallucinating
crimes
and they're convincing themselves they
see them here's what they've here's what
a number of people are hallucinating on
Twitter right now they're hallucinating
that that Twitter acted like a PR agent
for the Democrats that part you could
argue is true but therefore therefore
Twitter was giving a donation in kind to
Democrats
and that that would be illegal because
it's not you know they're not disclosing
how many of you think it would be
illegal that they're giving a donation
in kind by helping the Democrats
illegal okay for those of you who think
that's illegal
do you think Fox News
ever does anything that would help say
Trump when he was president
do you think Fox News has ever done
anything that would look like a donation
in kind
of course
about MSNBC
have ever done anything that looks
exactly like a donation in kind to the
Democrats of course how about the New
York Times how about the Washington Post
how about CNN of course
with the exception of axios
the only entity I know that's in the
news business that is trying to be
you know objective as far as I can tell
every other news agency is very clearly
doing work in kind for one of the
parties very clearly
who disagrees with that
nobody right
doesn't that you up a little bit
you're thinking oh this is clearly
illegal and then I tell you it's what
everybody's doing all the time
it's it's it's the Baseline of
everything
biased people doing things that are
helping one side that's all that's
happening there's nothing but that
happening except for axios it's the only
one axios is the only one who's not
doing it so you'd have to you'd have to
prosecute anybody
except axios
right
so that that's a terrible argument the
the uh the donation and kind argument
you're not going to see any TV lawyer
argue that I don't believe
because as soon as you say what about
Fox News it's over that's the end of the
argument
right
um the question about whether it should
be section 230 or not
um
I don't I don't find it interesting
I don't know why
but you know yeah let's talk about it
but I don't know I just don't find it
interesting I'm not sure why
uh
all right
was it a crime that the FBI and maybe
the Department of Justice and the dni I
guess so government entities were
meeting regularly with Twitter
to try to influence what things were
banned
is that illegal
the crime and the crime would be a
violation of the First Amendment
because when the government's involved
right
okay now let me ask you this do you
think that those same government
agencies talk to the other news entities
and encourage them
to do or not do different things
of course they do do you think there's
any entity that the government does not
talk to the big ones on a regular basis
to try to influence them
it's all of them
what would make Twitter different
here here's the defense for the FBI
uh that's our job
that's our job if we see something
that's uh both inaccurate and
dangerous we're going to tell the people
who are spreading it so that they can
decide to maybe not spread it
if you think it's illegal are you going
to be surprised when there's no no court
case
because there's no court case for
anybody else
why would they be treated differently
so let me ask you this if you remember
the FBI and you say to a big company
unless they could be CNN or Fox News or
Twitter if you say I'd like to have a
meeting is that illegal
the meeting's okay right
and then let's say in the meeting they
do talking they do some talking and they
say we think this is what would be a
good way to go
is that illegal
let me give you a story that happened to
me
I have a well on my property
which is rare because it's his
grandfathered in from many years ago
when I bought the property I inherited
that right
but when the uh when California had a
big water shortage a couple years ago
I was the only person who could water my
lawn
now it's mostly drip irrigation you know
it's a pretty efficient system but I was
using my own water
to water my own lawn what did my local
government ask me to do
my local government asked me to cut it
out
and they said explicitly it's totally
legal what you're doing it's your own
water we cannot make you stop using it
I'd like you to stop using it
and I'd like you to do it because we
think it's you know good for the
basically good for the community you
know that they it's bad Optics right bad
Optics
and I I agreed and it cost me fifty
thousand dollars
because that's how much of my landscape
died
and I had to replace it something like
that I mean might have been 30 000 I
don't know but it's really very
expensive
very expensive and I did that because my
City leaned on me
was that legal
was it legal for my city to lean on me
that way
if it wasn't legal for them to lean on
me that way
why would it be legal for them to offer
an opinion to a news entity if there's
no threat
remember there's no explicit threat my
my town did not give me an explicit
threat
they just said this is what we think is
the right thing to do
now
it's a bad analogy if you're comparing
all the parts
the right way to use an analogy is to
pick out one thing you think is the
useful part and only focus on that and
the useful part is
if my government leans on me
but I don't have to do what they want
but I do feel like it's a little bit of
Mafia talk like maybe they might come
after me some way
I don't know
I don't know the answer to that
I don't know the answer but here's what
I think in my perfect world
the government is full of human beings
who are citizens of this of this country
and those citizens can say anything they
want wherever they are
that's what I say I say if you're the
FBI you can say exactly what you think
is right to anybody
to anybody because the FBI also have
freedom of speech
they can have a meeting with anybody
and they can say anything that isn't you
know their opinion now I would like
their opinions to be well intentioned
and so far there's no evidence that I've
seen
that the government came it came to
Twitter with bad intentions
as NBC encounter evidence I've seen
evidence that they met evidence that
they influenced them
is there evidence that their influence
was the bad kind
or did they simply help them take down
things that were literally dangerous and
untrue
somebody says suppression is bad
but the problem is
you can't say you can't suppress free
speech
to support free speech and that's what
you're suggesting you're suggesting that
the the government the FBI
should not have free speech in this case
because if they exercise their free
speech
it would impinge on your free speech
that's what you're saying
well I I think uh I think the FBI
as an entity
maybe should not you know do a thing
that's against your Free Speech but the
individuals within the FBI
have free speech
they could have a meeting with anybody
they want and they can say anything they
want as long as it's legal
I don't think they have anything to to
answer to
now I haven't heard the specific
examples
if if the if the specific examples were
I'd like you to suppress Republicans
totally illegal
would you agree
if the if the government asked Twitter
even just asked without any threat just
asked if they said can you suppress
these Republicans so that they don't get
elected totally illegal everybody on
board with that that would be totally
illegal that would be an obvious you
know pressure on free speech that we
couldn't but what if the FBI went there
with the only intention
of making sure that Twitter knew what
was true and what wasn't true of things
that could be dangerous
suppose that was their legitimate
intention
is that illegal
I don't see how it could be
because that's what I will want my
government to do
if you told me my government wasn't
telling people
important things that they knew I would
I'd say that's a bigger problem
I want the government to tell anybody
who needs to know there's some danger
that we see that maybe you don't see
you don't want your government to alert
you to Danger
even if they're wrong
they might be wrong but seriously you
don't want them to alert you
to a legitimate danger that they
honestly see as a danger
now
if you're saying to me God's got Scott
Scott they're pretending to be honest
Brokers but really really it's all about
suppressing Republicans it might be
but it's not an Evidence
your suspicions would be
you know certainly well placed but it's
not an Evidence
I think I'd want to
all right
I'm trying not to get triggered
if you can't deal with the fact that I'm
just going to try to show both sides of
this as
as straight as I can
and that looks to you like I'm spinning
or like I'm I'm an apologist
you are really missing the show
all right because nothing like that's
happening
you don't know my opinion of just
describing things
just describing
all right
um would you agree that all of our major
media have bias in favor of one side
with the exception of axios would you
agree
and and how different is Twitter is it
some people say Scott
you're missing the difference
because a major media entity is only
censoring itself
whereas Twitter was censoring you
citizens
to which I say
what
that's not true
the major media is censoring you too
they're totally censoring you
yeah
did do you think if you had an opinion
that was counter to the narrative on
MSNBC they would invite you as a guest
as a citizen hey citizen
come on here and give us your counter or
no no they would censor you right now
the fact that individuals tweet whereas
the news you know is they're doing more
vetting to see who gets on that's kind
of a small difference it's a pretty
small difference these are entities
which are absolutely
squashing opinions on one side to
promote the other and they are squashing
them of citizens
who have an interest in the news
representing them all but it's not
happening
when they do it covertly it's not for
the public good it's all covertly it's
all covertly
are you aware of the meetings that MSNBC
has about who they put on the air and
who they don't no it's all covert
so
one is broadcasting they're both
broadcasting
yeah yeah you have to work pretty hard
to find out why you'd be angry at
Twitter for acting exactly like all the
media that you're kind of okay with
I mean you don't like the ones that
disagree with you
but you're not you're not fighting with
the fact that they're all biased because
you like the one that's biased on your
side
Twitter was strong armed by the FBI is
not in evidence
that's not an Evidence
there's no evidence of strong Army
nothing
well if you've seen it
I have not seen it
so when I let's be clear about something
we're still in the fog of War a little
bit so if I say there's no evidence to
something
don't tell me I'm wrong
tell me what the evidence is okay can
you do that
because it doesn't help me to say I'm
wrong if I think I'm right just tell me
what
tell me what they found
is if you're saying it's implied because
of the FBI I don't think that's true
put yourself in the room
put yourself in the room
FBI says we would like you to ban this
one
this one and this one and you say huh
okay I agree on this one I agree on that
one
no this one doesn't violate our terms of
service I disagree on that one
then why do you think you're going to
get audited or something
if you put me in that room I would not
be afraid of the FBI
I mean unless they really want Mafia
talk on me but if they were just coming
in to say I think these three things are
pro lost my connection if they're
just coming in to say these three things
are a problem and then I say I agree
with two but not the third and then
that's the end of the meeting
did they strong Army
I don't think so
you're saying it's laughably stupid I'm
telling you how I would feel
today a number of people have told me
I'm wrong about my own opinion in my
head
my opinion could be wrong but I'm not
wrong about what I'm thinking
that part I get right every time
all right
uh what about all the doctors suspended
what about it
what about it now some of these what
about this what about that you're taking
it from the perspective that I agree
with everything Twitter did that's not
happening
I'm not descending Twitter I'm
describing
so you don't have to say what about what
about that would be for somebody
defending
I'm not defending
I'm describing
so so don't challenge me to defend
something that's not the topic I'll
describe it for you if you want
um
when I say you're not going to like it
I'm priming that's not you know that
right I'm priming you to be more
flexible I'm not
that's a priming statement
all right
all right let's see what else is going
on
um
well here's the thing here's what I see
I think it's going to be very unsettling
for the public to learn
that
voters do not consider the facts and
then go vote
because that's sort of the model that we
all had you know some years ago we
imagine that voters would look at the
information
they'd come to their decisions and then
they'd go vote but you know nothing like
that happens right
that's like our
our fantasy version of our system in
this fantasy version we become informed
voters and then we vote
that's never been the truth never what's
true is
for every big media entity there's
usually one billionaire who tells that
entity what they can and cannot say
and then they assign that opinion to the
public and the public believes they made
up their own mind
and then they vote
yeah the the biggest the biggest problem
with what we're finding out about
Twitter is people are learning that they
were never independent
um agents they were just sort of doing
what they were programmed to do so
that's sort of the bigger picture and
once people realized that none of this
stuff is real
like all that who did what whatever let
me give you an example
how many of you think that the election
was changed by the fact that James Woods
got banned on Twitter
do you think that changed the election
yeah
no I don't I don't think he changed any
votes I'm not even sure the Banning
Trump on Twitter made any difference
I don't know I mean it may it certainly
helped him get it elected the first time
but by the time they were suppressing
him a week before the election
might have made a difference but I doubt
it
uh stopping the New York Post had an
effect did it
do you think there's even one person who
really would have devoted differently
this is there there's a survey that says
that some number of people would have
voted differently if they'd known about
the Biden laptop
that's not the real world
let me let me describe the real world
and then compare it to that fantasy one
that you have in your head where people
got information and then the new
information changed their decisions
is that the world you live in
where people can get new political
information right before the election
and then they change their decision
that doesn't happen in the real world
let me describe how it happens we just
got some information that everything
about the laptop is true I'm a Democrat
voter and I have to vote tomorrow what
do I do
what do I do I'm a Democrat voter and I
find out that everything about the
laptop is true what do I do now
I explained it away in my head
I explained it away is no that's about
Hunter
and then other people say no no you're
missing the story it's not just about
Hunter it's about the big guy and then
the influence
but I'm but I'm a Democrat
and I don't want Trump to win
so I say yeah that's just about Hunter
and I say it's like you're not even
hearing me it's not about Hunter it's
about his father and potential
connections yeah but that's not proven
see what I mean you you tell me
uh
that's a good suggestion
um
you tell me that you think that a
Democrat would have changed their vote
because about something about hunter's
laptop
I don't think there's any chance of that
there's nothing we've learned about
people or the world or anything that
would suggest that that would change any
Minds whatsoever
are you seeing these the Twitter file
the Twitter file Revelations have you
seen anybody change their mind
have you seen any Democrats say damn
I had no idea I was on the team that was
doing bad things I I'm going to change
the Republican now
yeah
so we can we can get all excited about
how much difference any of this
information makes but it probably
doesn't
what what does make a difference is that
it's good to know
you know I think transparency helps so
the more transparency the better
now here's here's to be the toughest
part for you
uh consistent with my theme of the month
individuals are innocent until proven
guilty
Jack Dorsey
innocent
unless proven guilty so far there's no
evidence to implicate him for the
decisions you don't like
none will we find out that he is Maybe I
I would say that would be well within
the possible range of outcomes but not
yet
not yet
now let's talk about the old
Roth
is he a bad guy
you go
bad guy
see some yeses
not a fan
all right what
what do we know about his intentions
from the Twitter files and everything
else we know what were his intentions
with his actions around what he banned
and what he didn't what were his
intentions
do you know
well we can't read his mind
but the intention that let's say would
be suggested by his actions
are that
he had a world view
of what was good and safe and you know
what would be a good way to live in the
world and then he acted as best he could
to be consistent with some notion of
what would be the right thing
that's all I saw
now you're saying but Scott he did the
wrong thing did he
he had he had two ways to lose and no
way to win
right because if he followed the terms
of service to the letter
you know that that won't won't capture
all the the weird possibilities right
would you agree with that you certainly
had the option he had the option of
following the letter of the terms of
service
but if he had done that would you agree
there would be a whole bunch of gray
areas
that maybe a human should have made the
decision about or a group of humans
do you want the rules to be the rules
because there's a reason that we have a
jury trials
the reason we have a jury trial is that
you think things are cut and dried but
they rarely are there's always these
extenuating circumstances that you'd
rather have a human wrestle with not a
not a terms of service
so I would say the following things
anybody who thinks that you could just
follow the terms of service that's very
unrealistic
that's very unrealistic and I would
certainly not want to know you if you
believe that anybody who would follow a
technical rule
and allow it to harm somebody
when they had the power to stop it that
is very unethical right very unethical
if you see a rule and it's your job to
follow the rules and everybody agreed on
the rules but there's this exception
your human
fiduciary responsibility is to take the
exception
because you have a higher you have a
higher responsibility to humanity than
you do to following some rules even if
everybody likes those rules
so I don't think that whoever was in
that position would have any choice but
to make judgment calls
and he made judgment calls it was his
job now suppose he'd made them
differently would everybody be happy
suppose suppose he had looked at these
situations and made whatever is the
opposite of all his decisions would that
have made everybody happy
nope because these are judgment calls
there isn't any situation in which a
small group or even one person can make
a judgment that makes everybody happy
so don't ask don't ask Joel Roth to do
something that's literally impossible
literally impossible you can't do the
impossible and we're asking him to do
that and judging him harshly because he
didn't do the impossible The Impossible
was making everybody happy
there was no path to make everybody
happy
this was some poor bastard who as far as
I can tell
as far as I can tell was doing the best
he could
in an impossible situation
but
if you say there's an impossible
situation and it's going to affect
humans
I want a person in that situation and I
want that person to be empathetic
more than a rule follower
right I want some empathy in that job
did he have empathy I think so
he looks like a like a normal caring
person who thought the world should be
one way and I I think he had narrative
poisoning
as many of us do yeah I think he was
buying into a narrative a little bit
maybe more than you think he should have
but that's not evil it's not different
than the rest of us
and here's why I'm
um
here's why I'm going hard at this
if you tell somebody to do an impossible
job
and then they do it because somebody has
to do it right somebody's got to do it
and then they make a decision within
that impossible job it's kind of
up to tell them they made a mistake
because you didn't have to make that
decision right you should just be lucky
it wasn't your job because it wasn't any
way to do it to make everybody happy
so if you're complaining about him
because he didn't make you happy you're
on the wrong page
where was the option that he could make
everybody happy
that didn't exist
so if you're saying he did not make me
happy with this decision that says
nothing about him
that's not about him that's about the
situation is impossible
somebody had to do the job
and somebody had to take the arrow in
the back and he did
now should he have been fired probably
but that probably had more to do with
you know what he told his boss and you
know how the company would look if he
stayed and he had a lot a lot of
considerations there but so far with
what we know
it looks like a person in an impossible
situation who has tried to do their best
job
now
how many of you thought to yourself Oh
you mean like a Nazi prison guard
if you thought that
about an American citizen just trying to
do the best he could for America and you
said oh like a prison guard at a Nazi
concentration camp check check yourself
check yourself right if you think that's
a fair comment an American citizen with
actual empathy for human beings doing
the best he could do in an impossible
situation where nobody's going to love
it
uh I I think he's closer to needing a
medal than you know being prosecuted but
he probably needed to get fired because
there was there's something that needed
to get fixed there and you probably had
to get rid of him to do it
all right well
Cindy says in all caps Scott really is
getting more ridiculous
so that's cognitive dissonance
so if you want to know a tell for
cognitive dissonance it would be all
caps Scott really is getting more
ridiculous
tell number one all gaps
tell number two
no reason given
yeah so everybody is just coming after
me personally because my arguments are
very simple aren't they I'm not making a
complicated argument it would be really
easy to say well you forgot this fact
or your logic is incomplete
easy one sentence you could say what
what you don't like about my opinion but
if your opinion is there's something
wrong with Scott today he used to be
good but now he's not good anymore what
happened to Scott he used to be wise but
now he's not if you're having that
reaction
you are having cognitive distance
I didn't get Dumber today
I did not get Dumber today I'm exactly
as wise or unwise as I was yesterday if
you think I changed suddenly
probably you probably you
all right
um what else is going on
um
this is kind of funny uh one bizarre
this is a tweet from Mike Solana on
Twitter he says one bizarre element of
the Twitter story is it's pretty clear
at this point that the quote trust and
safety team was effectively running the
entire company
and Elon Musk responded that with
absolutely the real CEO was the head of
trust and safety
which again
is
confirming that Jack Dorsey wasn't aware
of the details that were going on so
Elon Musk
seems to be excusing Jack Dorsey at
least in terms of knowledge of the
situation
he knows more than we do
so
all right
um
but I love the fact that the
the the the the perfect literary
um thing here is that Twitter's trust
and safety group is the group that we
don't trust
with our safety there's nobody you trust
less than the trust and safety group
nice and nice irony there
all right
so what about the fact that uh that
Twitter was making up the rules as they
go
I don't have any problem with that at
all
Scott trusted the vaccines incorrected
just me you starting
rumors and
saying bad things about me so people
will try to come after me as they do you
 jerk no I did not support the
vaccines that never happened you
you're gone
all right
um
we also found out so far
that there's no evidence that the Trump
Administration or at least the Trump
team
asked Twitter to suppress anything
what do you think that's going to hold
do you think we'll get to the other side
of this and there won't be any evidence
that that the Trump team asked Twitter
to suppress something
now it's a little unclear because the
FBI worked for the Trump Administration
so
you know what do you what do you call
that
thank you
am I blocking people
yeah I'll block you
I'll hide you on this channel
um
you can make the same view about Putin
he has a world view I do make the same
argument yeah
see the the only the only thing I'm uh
trying to add to the conversation is if
you believe that the Twitter employees
knew they were doing something bad
that's not an Evidence
that's not an Evidence I mean it might
be true but we don't have any any
evidence that they were aware they were
doing something bad now are you telling
me that the Nazis were not aware that
the the concentration camps were doing
something bad
you know I I get that they had their
weird justification for it but I think
they knew I mean I think they knew
um
Apparently one of the tweets that got
suppressed was on January 6th uh Trump
had a tweet that told everybody to go
home with love and peace
that's one of the ones that was
suppressed I think can you fact check me
on that
I I thought that's what I saw
but if that's true
then Trump got
um
he got in a lot of trouble
for not saying something he did say
which is be peaceful
now we do know in other ways he said to
be peaceful but
um
do you think the election was changed by
anything that Twitter did
foreign
some of you do
and specifically what do you think
changed the election was it suppressing
Trump
suppressing one week before the election
was it suppressing James Woods
or was expressed in the laptop
well I think we have suspicions that
might have changed things but I'm I'm
highly suspicious
I I might have might have
um
now apparently according to Twitter user
name redacted name redacted 24 7.
um
who seems to be very well informed this
Twitter user who is anonymous listed 12
prior FBI employees who now work at
Twitter in important positions so there
are 12 fpi agents
past FBI agents embedded at Twitter
and they were all hired after uh after
Trump
that's sort of a red flag isn't it a
little red flag
but uh that was tweeted at Elon Musk
we'll see if he see if he looks into
that
um
all right
what else is happening
oh um
so
the certavich said something about all
the child exploitation stuff on Twitter
and apparently under the musk regime
musk is doing more to
combat it
and
um
one of the comments that musk responded
to is that it is a crime that Twitter
refused to take action on child
exploitation for years but Jack Dorsey
chimed in on that and said this is false
so it is false that Twitter refused to
take action on child exploitation but
Elon Musk chimed in on Jack and said no
it's not false when somebody who works
there who now runs trust and safety
joined Twitter earlier this year almost
no one was working on child safety
she raised the issue and then musk
um
I guess musk is the only one who staffed
it up properly according to Musk
so this is sort of a half fake news
Twitter was doing things about it it
wasn't as much as musk was doing
yeah
um
so mosque is doing the right thing by
the new CEO move so I've taught you
um
friction always does something that's
right I've taught you the new CEO move
right the new CEO move is when you
establish who you are about what you do
in the first you know week or two of
being the CEO
and what musk has cleverly done
is going hard at the child endangerment
stuff
so that that becomes like something you
remember it's like a first impression
you'll always remember Musk as being a
champion against child endangerment now
if he'd done just as much as he's doing
now
but he did it let's say a year after he
took the job
you wouldn't even notice you wouldn't
even notice so he's doing it exactly
right like psychologically
strategically leadership wise
exactly he found the biggest the biggest
thing that wasn't being addressed that
everybody cared about and that he's
putting on the show of addressing it in
a big way
you can't do better than that that
that's that's the best you can do you
pick the most important topic that
everybody agrees on mostly
he went after it hard and he went after
it right away
that's a triple plus you you there's
nothing you can do better than that
that's as good as anybody can do
anything
all right
all right
um
how many of you think that Twitter
meddled in the election that that's the
statement of Truth
they meddled in the election
all right yes
would you say that CNN meddled in the
election
would you say that all of the major
Media Fox News
Etc did they all meddle in the election
yes yes they did
now would you say that what Twitter did
was
um functionally worse now you could
argue that it's a different kind of
platform different people use it
different people see it that's not the
question so I know different people are
using it but is it
is it more or worse than what MSNBC did
it's not worse you think it's worse
you think that MSNBC
having a
Liars on non-stop all day long
you think that that wasn't that's not
worse than Twitter trying to ban you
know James Woods and Libs of tick tock
to me it's not even close
yeah I I you know I mean this is a
judgment call so I'm not going to say
you're wrong
but my opinion for what it's worth is
that MSNBC is an order of magnitude
worse than anything we've seen in
Twitter
and I would say Fox News as well but
only because they clearly are
you know their their narrative makers
they make a narrative for their side
they're credible but Twitter's not
credible I don't know
Twitter was not supposed to be biased
uh
that comment though Twitter is not
supposed to be biased
that's not really a real world comment
though
in the real world there's no such thing
as unbiased
communication
that's not a thing
yeah maybe they were supposed to try but
now what makes you say they're unbiased
because from their point of view they
probably weren't
why is your opinion of what bias is why
is that more important
than someone else's opinion about biases
well like why do you get to be the judge
of what bias is and I don't why can't I
be the judge it's a tie right it's just
your opinion versus mine
all right
here are the uh things that I hoped I
could get across today
what Twitter did isn't worse than the
other major media companies is that an
apology is that an apologist
did I just defend Twitter by saying
they're no worse than MSNBC
somebody's going to say that oh I
defended Twitter by saying they're no
worse than MSNBC
if you don't know anything else about me
if I compare somebody to MSNBC I'm not
defending them
that's the opposite of defending them
that that is damning them in the
strongest terms
I'm just saying they're all sort of in
the same Cesspool right which is if
you're looking for the the no bias
platform
I believe there's only one option just
axios and they don't really cover every
bit of news so they're a little bit of a
different platform
uh
and
while I don't disagree with you about
your suspicions of what anybody knew or
did or privately thought
um innocent until proven guilty
now if you told me that we could get
this far into this
with no evidence no direct evidence
that uh Jack did something illegal or
immoral or wrong
I would have been surprised you figure
any CEO is going to look you know a
little bit bad if you start digging in
enough
but so far
so far
now if I I'm not going to defend whether
he managed the company in the optimal
way
I don't know the answer to that but you
know clearly there was an issue here so
I'm not going to defend it on that level
and I'd be surprised if he defended it
himself
I don't think anybody who is running two
major companies
can quite honestly defend that they gave
their best to both
would you agree
nobody could be running two companies at
the same time and say I gave my best to
both
I mean I think I think a realistic
person would say you know
that could have been better
but at the same time you know there's a
reason that Jack came back
to active management is because what
they had before wasn't working
so I I don't know what the trade-off is
there
defending Jack is a Fool's errand
somebody says
okay did you miss all of the parts where
I said I wasn't defending anybody
did you miss all of those parts
can you get yourself out of that mode
just for me yeah if you're dealing with
somebody else that's fine
but I'm just describing
now I'm describing that is your
interpretation if that's a defense
right that is your interpretation
because I would tell you if it's my
interpretation
if if I were defending anybody
I would tell you I'm defending them
because why wouldn't I I have no reason
to hide it I would just say I'm doing it
and then I do it
I'm I'm describing it and then you can
judge whether that's good or bad
Scott thinks we are the ignorant ones
that somebody says
gosh
why would I think that
uh you didn't speak of how the
independent voters might have dealt with
the laptop yet because there are none
independent voters are a myth
um independent voters almost always vote
with with one party it's just they call
themselves independent because they
don't want to be slimed with the bad
things that party does
yeah Twitter is the Public Square all
right the things that don't add to the
conversation
because everybody knows it Twitter is
the Public Square
we all get it we all get it it is
different than other things and it's
special in that way
uh and Twitter's a private company we
all get it I get it
right
um
yeah
so I guess
um
right yeah yeah Kirsten Cinema is now
independent but is she
foreign
Libertarians yeah yeah certainly a week
before the election people had their
word their minds made up
um are you enjoying triggering this
morning a little bit
you literally just said Twitter is the
same
like
analogies are so difficult aren't they
to Twitter is the same on one dimension
and different on the other dimensions
can you handle that
so Twitter Twitter is the same in the
sense that they're a biased organization
that influences elections that's the
same
I didn't say that
they're literally the same they're the
same in that one way
Scotty wants to give the old Roth the
medal I assume that that's you're
pretending to be a troll
yeah I did grab them by the change
any uh votes I've never I doubt it I
think some people say maybe
but I doubt it
you think do you think yes
Maybe
I just doubt it I I think that it was a
fake because
some people might have wanted to do it
and they said ah okay that's that'll be
my my reason
imagine if you were uh you're a woman
and you're married to a conservative
who's definitely a trump supporter
and you don't want to vote the same way
as your husband but you also need to
live with your husband
you just don't want that Donald Trump
and then they grab them by the
thing happens
and you say there it is I can use that
as my reason to not vote for Trump and
my husband can't say a damn thing
it's my ultimate out right it's my get
energy all free ah now I can vote
against Trump and I've got a reason
but is it the real reason
probably not probably not it's a fake
because
although it might have changed the vote
the fake because can change the vote
uh somebody says his wife played it that
way
did the fine people hoax change the
votes
probably did yeah I think the the fine
people hoax is the tent pole hoax it's a
hoax that makes you believe the other
hoaxes
because if they can get you to believe
that absurd hoax that you just have to
watch the video to debunk they can
really get you to believe anything and
then all right we've proved he's a
racist now everything else that might
suggest that must be true because this
one hoax is holding up all the others
um
all right Twitter Amplified it right
okay that's all I got for now I'm gonna
go talk to the locals people for a
little bit thanks for joining
bye for now
