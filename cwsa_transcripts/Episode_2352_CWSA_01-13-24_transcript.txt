good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and
pretty sure you've never had a better
time this is going to be an amazing
morning for you full of intrigue
interest special interest human interest
every kind of interest if you'd like to
take this up to a level that well humans
can barely even understand all you need
for that is a cup or mug or a glass a
tanker chal toin a canteen jug or flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee and join
me now for the unparallel pleasure the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the
simultaneous Sip and it happens now
go very good very good top 10 one of the
best sips
ever hey let's talk about the
news I don't know why this is news but
uh Fox News has reportedly pilled pilled
pulled pulled not pilled they pulled the
pillow advertisements for my pillow and
Mike Lindell now there were no reason
given but there's a coincidence
involved that apparently Mike Lindell
has his own network is that true Mike
Lindell started his own network for
news and apparently Mike Lindell
hired um an X Fox News guy Mike um
what's his name why am I forgetting his
name the one who used to work in lbs
yeah so he so Mike Lindell hires lbs who
used to work for Fox
News I think they had similar opinions
about the accuracy of the last
election and Fox News pulled the
advertisements in other words Fox News
was no longer willing to take money from
Mike
Lindell that's pretty radical isn't it
that you're no no no longer willing to
take money from your one of your biggest
advertisers interesting but they got
plenty of ticktock money because Tik
tok's an advertised
now no problem what what could possibly
be the problem here yeah no
problem so that's probably exactly what
it looks like um Fox News would be a
competitor I guess with Mike Lindell so
they just wanted to cut connections
that's not actually too surprising you
know once once he becomes their
competitor you know can't can't expect
him to play
along all right uh
NBC has a news story today about uh what
science has discovered about a giant
10-ft ape that that lived 200,000 years
ago uh in China they found some bones I
guess but they figured out what
killed the 10-
foot huge Apes can you
guess do you want to take a guess
climate change that's right yeah
according to NBC news our science is now
so good that we can tell what a monkey
was thinking 200,000 years
ago they actually make that claim they
say that the uh climate made it
difficult for them to get their normal
food source and unlike the other Apes
okay it's an ape not a monkey but unlike
the other Apes who adjusted and you know
just found other food
sources uh these big old Apes uh they
were too dumb and they decided not to
diversify the food sources so they they
died so climate change killed the big
the big
Apes now
remember I told you that you can't
understand any of the news unless you
know the
players now allegedly I don't I don't
have confirmation of this myself but
people who seem to know more than I do
claim that NBC is a big old CIA
propaganda you know
operation is
it how would I know I wouldn't know but
I'll tell you what if they were that
would act exactly like
this what what do you think it does to
you when you hear that something that's
in a little bit like
you you know an upright walking probably
10 foot
ape don't you say to yourself huh if
climate change killed that Big Ape
aren't we in danger yes now obviously
there's not a direct connection between
the 200,000 year old apes and and humans
but your brain doesn't know that your
your brain will say uhoh it killed a Big
Ape just like me it must be ready to
kill me
too so this is the kind of story that
you would only expect from somebody
who's tried to brainwash
you right now how many of you think the
science actually knows why these Apes
died to 100,000 years ago do you think
you really know that do you think this
science can figure out what the Apes
were thinking and why they died 200,000
years ago the the absurdity that they
would want us to believe that that's
something they can do or they can
know it's pretty funny actually you're
saying to yourself Scott can you move
that microphone because it's putting an
annoying Shadow on your chin how many of
you were thinking that just now yeah you
were thinking that but now it's all
better you're
welcome all right well
uh are all of you uh as puzzled as I am
why the following story is not being
carried by all the major news
organizations is there something I
missed or do I have a a date wrong or
something here's what I think happened I
think I think that uh representative Tim
berett and a couple other of uh people
Congress had access to a skiff the top
secret most secretive place you could
ever go to look at materials that are so
secretive you can't even make a copy so
you have to go see the originals in a
special little secure building because
that's our top top top secret nothing is
more secret than stuff that's in a
skiff so of course the representatives
can't tell us what they saw because they
get to see it but it's top secret
so what did Tim Brett say after uh he
saw this stuff he said that uh it was
obvious to the people who were with him
and to him that uh David grush The
Whistleblower about the UFOs is
legit now David grush says that the US
has in his possession numerous downed
UFOs and Al what he calls biologics in
other words parts of the aliens
themselves and we got them in big
warehouses and that's well known it's
been going on for years and according to
Tim
bersett and the top secret information
which he can't be more specific about he
can tell us that everybody who was in
the skiff believes that the
Whistleblower is legit and that Earth is
being visited by some kind of advanced
intelligence either for manner space or
for the inner core or possibly the
ocean or possibly North Korea because we
don't know what's going on up
there oh what do you think about
that there was another representative
who uh I didn't get his name but he he
had a a great answer for why um Congress
can't get better answers from the
government about the UFOs or uaps as
they like to call them and what he said
was you can ask these guys
questions but everybody is only allowed
to answer in their little
domain so it's actually
possible this is hilarious to me as the
author of Dilbert it's possible that the
government is so incompetent that every
part of the government only knows one
thing and that the government
collectively doesn't know if the aliens
are real or if they have
them that's right I actually believe
that the government as an entity doesn't
know if it has in its possession
aliens now I know that sounds ridiculous
now that would now what I mean is that
if we had any aliens which I'm super
skeptical of I don't think we have any
aliens or any
spaceships and I'm going to I'm going to
say that forever like you I'd have to
touch it myself to believe there's an
alien spaceship no I don't think there
are any ens
but I think it's fascinating that the
information in the government is so
compartmentalized and of course every
government employee knows I can only
talk about the thing I know I'll get
fired if I talk about anything else it
may be that you can't ask enough
questions to find out what's going on
because there's nobody who could tell
you not only what they do but how it
connects to other people and without
that you wouldn't know what's going on
so and the I figure which politician was
was yesterday said if you don't know to
ask the exact question they're not going
to help you because they could only
going to answer the exact question so if
you said to them uh The Whistleblower
says you have I'll just make make this
up but the Whistleblower says you have
10 Alon UFOs is that
true no it's not
true what did you
learn you didn't learn whether or not
there's aliens because you didn't ask
the question right you should have asked
are there any do we have any ship so
that I'm just making up that example but
the point is it might be that the
government is so ineffective and
distributed and
bureaucratic that almost nobody in the
government can even answer the question
do we have any
aliens so presumably there would be a
very small number of people who knew the
real
answer if we had real aliens but I don't
think we have real aliens do you know
what I think
I think it's a CIA op and I think the op
is being played on these members of
Congress I think Tim Beret is being uh
played I I think that they they've
identified him as a gullible I hate to
say it because I kind of like him you
know when I when I see him on TV I see
him a lot I say to myself oh I'd like
that guy like he'd be somebody you'd
hang out with and have a beer like he
just looks like a real nice guy and he
looks like he's actually treding to do
the right thing you know he gives off
the vibe of an actual citizen who got
elected who wants to
help and I think that they're using
him I think that his sincerity is what
makes him uh a little bit vulnerable now
I'm just speculating I don't have any I
have no information you know to directly
say that but I'm pretty sure we don't
have any
aliens so if there was anything in a
skiff that suggested we all we abs
abolutely have some
aliens that had to be our intelligence
people distracting
us
right because while this was happening
and then now here's the other
thing I looked um I saw a video clip
about this this topic yesterday and I
said to myself oh i' better catch up on
this story must be a big story in the
Press because if Cong if members of
Congress are talking about it and they
had this experience and they had this
Revelation that these aliens are
real that's like the biggest story isn't
it did you see that story anywhere in
the Press did you see it written
anywhere I saw I did a Google Search and
there were a bunch of videos that
probably all appointed to the same
video why why would there be like a
YouTube video or
two but nobody wrote a
story members of our government just
confirmed that our government has alien
spaceships and
bodies now confirmed I don't mean it's
true because I'm sure it's not true but
they thought so there are members of our
government who saw secret information
from our
government and then told the public yeah
it's
true and it's not on
CNN there's no written article about it
what does that tell
you what do does that tell
[Music]
you I mean to me it tells me the Press
knows it's not
true what else could you conclude it
would be the biggest story not just of
the
week of the
year of the
decade of the
century of the entire history of
humanity it would be the biggest story
of all there wouldn't be no bigger
story right and a disappeared the
biggest story in the history of
humankind if it were true but CNN
decided that wasn't
newsworthy here's what I think I think
at the top of the
news uh pile they know it's not
true and so they don't want to be the
embarrassed ones who write about it so
that there're maybe everybody's hoping
somebody else will cover it it's like
well I hope you guys cover it cuz this
one doesn't seem too true to
us I just think about the fact that Tim
brette is a Republican and I'm pretty
sure that Fox News didn't cover the
story did they did Fox News cover it in
let's say written form they may have had
a video like others did it's weird that
it exists only in video because they're
making it disappear pretty well
anyway so it might be some kind of a
dilber situation cover up that's
accidental or intentional who
knows uh Trump lost a lawsuit I guess he
was pressing a lawsuit against the New
York Times over reporting about his
financials and he lost so he's going to
pay the legal fees
$400,000 so does that tell you that
Trump
lost because he has to pay
$400,000 depends what you call winning
if I were these reporters I would say to
myself I sure hated my last
year I I just spent a year defending
myself in court and buying lawyers and
borrowing money and and yeah that's
great that's great that I'll get
reimbursed but I just lost a year of my
life do you think Trump is happy with
the outcome $400,000 to send a warning
signal to anyone else who would use what
I'm guessing was maybe not the most
confirmed or information or maybe they
didn't put it in the quite the right
context that showed both sides I don't
know what the claim is exactly but don't
you think it sends a
chilling message to other reporters that
if you're going to write about Trump
maybe you better stick to the facts that
you're really sure about know what you
think I so I would call it a success for
$400,000 at his level of wealth to send
this uh warning shot across the bow of
reporters who might be looking at more
let's say speculative stories about him
yeah it's a brushback pitch I think he
got his money worth if that's if that's
the end of the uh the story it just cost
him $400,000 he got his money's worth
yeah so I guess on Monday uh
Iowa goes to vote for in the primary for
the Republicans and the big stories
about that are number one the weather so
apparently the snow is just insane so
the the ability of old people
especially to even get to the polling
places and or the caucus places I guess
uh would be very
limited now what does this tell you I'll
tell you I'll tell you the message I'm
getting from
this every time you think you're in a
system where the system is you know
working to uh Express the will of the
people so that the people can see for
example uh that their vote counted and
they picked the people that they want I
feel like there's always it's like
Charlie Brown's football there's always
something that that's like pulling the
football back just before you kick it
and I feel like the Idaho results are
going to be based on the
weather does it feel like that to
you ba basically Ju Just think about
this
V just absolutely blanketed that state
like nobody's ever done before not only
did he cover more of the precincts um he
covered every one which which is called
the full grassly he did a double grassly
and then it kept going he did a double
grassly he he visited every Precinct
that I know twice twice never been done
before just
absolutely uh just absolutely was just
all over
uh the
state and then it
snows it it could be it could be that
none of his work will make any
difference just because it snowed like
that's our system that's how we pick a
president by the snow basically so I
don't know if the snow suppresses
Democrats the same amount as it
suppresses Republicans but don't rep
Republic Republicans skew
older I think they do don't they
Republicans tend to be a little older
and if I saw a snowstorm I'd say fewer
older people are going to go outside on
the ice and in the
snow
so so good luck with that now V is
uh confidently predicting a surprise now
I don't know what a surprise looks like
first place or strong strong showing I
don't know what that would be but but he
might be right and this would be a good
test of the
polling um I think there's a good chance
that the people that V is attracting to
show up are exactly see see if you think
this is true the people he's
attracting are very much exactly the
people who don't show up in
polling am I right because the pollers
you know they got a problem because
they're they got landlines that they're
polling and then they do online polls by
young people don't bother to even read
them and you know a general poll of
people who don't care about politics is
completely different than the poll of
people might actually show up on a
primary or or a caucus right I mean
those are pretty dedicated
people so is it possible that V is
reading the room correctly because he
did have big crowds he had big crowds if
the size of the crowds was the
predictor and you didn't believe that
the could you know dig down deep enough
to find his supporters
specifically he might have a surprise he
he might actually he might actually pull
this off
yeah you know what's a fun uh party
game uh I was playing this yesterday
some of you heard me is to imagine the
the founders of our country America you
know the the famous ones your Ben
Franklin's and your George Washingtons
and Jeffersons and Hamilton and whatnot
and then map yourself into one of the
founders just ask yourself all right
which one would I be you which one's
closer and then fill out the other ones
all right so so you get one free pass to
be a Founder yourself uh I chose John
Adams so you know might as well pick my
cousin because I because I felt a little
like John Adams in this current
situation because we feel like we're in
a new American Revolution especially
with vake but also with Trump in that in
order for many of us to get the
president we
want um we have to know or understand is
there some big uni party power behind
politics that we don't see
directly like you need to know that
right but doesn't it feel as though both
V and Trump are a new American
Revolution against these hidden powers
that maybe we don't even know who they
are I don't know if that even exists I
don't even know if it exists I know
there are a lot of people pretty sure it
does but I don't hear names and you know
I don't I don't see
facts but it feels exactly like that
doesn't it and we'll talk about that a
little bit more but it does feel by
coincidence that we have something like
the founders have lined up the maps into
Thomas Jefferson really easily
because they're both bigger than big and
smarter than
smart and more patriotic than
Patriots like that's Thomas Jefferson
you know there were there were a lot of
smart people but Jefferson was smarter
than the Smart Ones that's faake he's
not just smart he's smarter than the
smart
people and Jefferson did the you know
Louisiana Purchase the American
Revolution and that's about the size of
the change the V is saying he'll do 75%
cut in the government you know get us
out of Wars basically huge changes so
that's that's very Jeffersonian and then
it does seem like uh maybe Trump feels a
lot like uh George
Washington doesn't it because Trump
seems like the one who's going into
battle he's actually fighting he's
literally fighting the lawfare the the
Cannons of the uh the system so George
wa so George Washington is he's
marshalling the Army you know the the
magga army or whatever it is against the
uh the Tories or whoever it is we're
fighting H then it seems very much like
Elon Musk is the the modern version of
Ben
Franklin now does he fit the the does he
fit the model of a
revolutionary well let's ask the Wall
Street Journal because the Wall Street
Journal just wrote the most
stupid article you'll ever see
that that decides that really whenever
you think of uh Elon Musk you should
think of Donald Trump because of the
same same
person you you goddamn
pieces of in the Wall Street
Journal what are you doing with this
article what what are you educating us
on what news is this this is pure
 propaganda this is disgusting
you should really be ashamed of yourself
Wall Street Journal this is not this is
not up to your standard I usually have a
lot of respect for the Wall Street
Journal but this is not up to your
standard this to me looks like a pure
hip piece that they're trying to
disguise as some kind of opinion
journalism important story it's not
important it's not journalism it's not
 news it's a hitpiece on one of
the most useful Americans in the history
of the
Republic why because Elon Musk runs a
platform that doesn't always hate Donald
Trump and that's that's why it exists or
at least that's why it got
published I can't read the mind of the
writer but I can tell
you it doesn't have news value so you do
the math
right amazing amazing and how do they
say he's the same because they both use
Twitter really well
that was one of the biggest evidences
that they're populists who use Twitter
really
well how exactly do you write a HIIT
piece about a
populist does doesn't that sound almost
like that's
backwards what the hell is a populist
except somebody that the people really
like once they get to know
him and they really agree with them once
they get to know that's what a populist
is
somebody who's popular because they're
doing the right things according to the
public so they they've got to make
populism look bad because Trump does it
Trump's the best populist ever I don't
know maybe of all time but Elon Musk is
definitely a populist as well in the
sense that he's trying to do things that
make sense and are popular I don't think
he does it because they're popular you
that's obvious but he does seem to be
very dedicated to what would be good and
make
sense such as population increase
instead of
decrease
um so got that going on um how many of
you saw the uh the AI created George
Carlin standup
comedy how many of you saw or listen to
that
clip anybody see
that so the story was that AI had
finally done what I said couldn't be
done which is right humor there was high
quality humor and in fact as good as the
real George Carlin so there was a video
that was going around and people were
impressed because this uh the writing
seemed to be almost humanlike
quality and uh I think I tweeted it
before I listened to
it I listened to one joke or something
and I thought the joke was so I thought
well you know it's word play so probably
AI did write it so I I spent the time to
listen to more of
it and about five minutes in it was
super obvious that AI did not make
that AI didn't make that how many you
thought the AI really made it that that
was your AI hoax of the weeks all right
so it was confirmed by the way that it
wasn't real yeah it it wasn't AI
but here's um I'm going to give you well
I guess I'm giving myself a pad on the
back it took
me just a few minutes of listening to it
to know it couldn't be AI because AI
can't do
that AI can't do that so I was pretty
sure the AI can't do that and sure
enough it didn't it didn't even came it
can't even come close so here's what it
did that was my tip
off uh part of the comedy was that
George Carlin uh was insulting God for
creating us and then creating all these
diseases to kill us now on one hand
that's said oh that's very George
carinish it's right right in his sweet
spot on the other hand there is no AI
that will ever insult
God AI is not going to insult God and
it's certainly not going to mock people
who have
diseases it's not going to do that
yes as soon as I heard the god part I
was like come on there's no way this is
AI but then then the story was okay it
was written it was written by a human
and we know the name of the human they
admit it I think at the end of the video
it actually says it actually somebody
said at the end of the video which I
didn't get to it reveals that it's not
real um but the claim is that the the
impersonation of George Carlin was
AI
even the impersonation didn't sound like
him there wasn't one thing that sounded
like George Carlin it didn't sound like
his voice the writing actually was
pretty close but it sounded like a it
sounded like a human imitating George
Carlin and I picked it out immediately
now uh the only reason I watched it let
me give a little credit here is that uh
Greg geld had watched it and he sent me
a message and said I probably shouldn't
tell you what private messages people s
but he wouldn't mind I don't think um
you said this doesn't look real does
it so Greg who writes jokes for a living
and understands your writing of course
you bestselling author uh it took him
two minutes to say this can't be real
and then I look I looked at it and was
like this can't be real right so anybody
who's a professional professional writer
and professional humorist especially you
see it right away yeah this did not fool
anybody who is in the
business all right there's uh no labels
it's a third- party group and they've
got this big pack and uh they're going
to be raising money to run some third
party person in 2024 who is not yet
selected now what have I told you about
how to understand news stories what I
always tell you is if the only thing you
know is the story you don't know
anything you have to know the players in
the story and how they're connected and
then you understand the story so if the
only thing I told you is there's this
thirdparty
group and they're raising money for a
third party what does that tell you not
really anything actually nothing
because uh you don't know who they're
going to run you don't know who they are
you don't know if it's legitimate don't
really know anything but now I'm going
to tell you the people
involved and watch watch all the gears
go click click click click click and
form a an entire picture for you right I
want I don't even need to connect the
dots I will but I don't need to listen
to
this uh let's see the person in charge
the group will be led by Kathleen
Shanahan who previously served as Chief
of Staff to former Florida Governor Jeb
Bush Republican
and worked as an aid to former
President George Bush and former Vice
President Dick
J any
questions are are there any further
questions
yeah um this is your
confirmation that we don't live in a
republic yeah this is your unip party
confirmation the Republicans are trying
to take Trump
out as much as the Democrats there's
only one way that that makes sense that
we don't have a real
government there is no other
explanation for
this now if they tell you oh it's
because we really think this third party
is viable you know that's not true
right you know they're not trying trying
to actually elect anybody nobody thinks
a third party can get elected the only
reason for a third party is if you're
True
Believers do you think that uh this
ex-chief of staff for these three major
Republican establishment people do you
think she's she's working out of a true
belief about helping the
Republic I don't think so I doubt it it
just looks like she's working for the
establishment
Republicans so why would the
establishment Republicans want to run a
third
party do you think they're doing it to
help Trump do you think that the chief
of staff previously of George of both
Jeb and George and Dick Shady do you
think that person has decided to help
Trump no
no
no so remember A's uh warning that the
real
play is to uh bump Trump out one way or
another whatever it takes uh put Haley
in because she's the unip Party
candidate that will spend our money on
Wars now that sounds pretty conspirator
crazy doesn't it honestly it sounds a
little
crazy
except every piece of evidence that we
can
confirm seems to be very compatible with
that point of
view now I'm open to the argument that
there's something in our reality that
would tell me that's unlikely where the
VES prediction that the election will be
rigged by uh not just the vote
necessarily but rigged by who's allowed
to run in the end you the the final
two it does look like that it looks
exactly like that
right so I'm not saying that I'm totally
endorsing
the uh the prediction that'll
happen but the has a hypothesis which
fits the
facts if he's right about
this
well he probably is
um all right yeah that's pretty much
confirmed that we are not what whatever
you thought about living in a republic I
think you could throw that away I
don't know what's going on exactly but
this is pretty much proof we're not
living in any kind of election you know
Republic Democrat
process something else is
happening all
right now what else um Biden
Administration is looking to reclassify
marijuana as a level three drug because
it's not as dangerous as the level ones
according to initial
research um now this is why I've been
promoting that we should have more trans
people in
government I mean I say it all the time
you know what we need in government is a
lot more trans people and here's why
here's a perfect example uh Rachel
LaVine uh Health and Human Services
assistant secretary for health uh she
wrote a letter to The Drug Enforcement
Administration in which she's basically
uh advocating for making marijuana
schedule three so that is good work
Rachel LaVine and all of you
haters with your anti-r stuff well the
jok's on you because Rachel lavine's
doing some good work here according to
me you don't have to agree with that by
the way no uh can we can we do some NPC
stuff I like to do the show for NPCs as
well as the rest of you who are actually
real people because I have NPCs who
watch as well and I like to service
everybody all right now uh if you're an
NPC the way to look at the question of
marijuana either legalization or change
in the scheduling is this uh assume that
everybody who smokes marijuana is
injured or or nobody whoever smoked at
marijuana had a bad experience and also
you must believe that marijuana is
either completely good for you all the
time or completely bad for everybody all
the time and then make your argument
based on that now the people who are um
real people not NPCs you are still
allowed to look at the pluses and the
minuses of all issues so you could say
for example huh it appears as Scott is
getting more benefit than cost and of it
because he uses it medically and reports
many many benefits and his life appears
is no worse for it but you could also
say equally true I know this teenager
who is ruining their life because the
marijuana is sucking all the joy out of
them and turning them into porn
addicts also true also true yeah and
it's a tough question in a free Society
whether I get the freedom to use it in a
way that as far as I can tell is all
entirely productive and makes me happy
and I couldn't be
happier at the same time I do know it's
going to kill that teenager I do know
that right and I don't want that so what
do you do well that's why we have
governments but uh Rachel LaVine good
job on that um let's talk about the
dumbest story in the news California
reparations believe it or not this is
still a
story uh you remember the background
that Governor Nome uh authorized a
commission to go
study the question of reparations for
descendants of slaves and when the
recommendation came back to give $1.2
million to every uh person who is
eligible for reparations Governor Nome
said I'm not going to endorse
that I don't hate it I don't hate it I
don't criticize it but I'm not accepting
it and uh what he said was not that it
was wrong or bad instead he said you
know it's more it's about more than
money reparations is about more than
money it's about you know fixing
systemic racism in a variety of ways
yeah but the issue is still there and I
would like to point out the following as
long as this issue still exists in other
words it's still an active question in
California he can he can never be
elected
president a republican would bury him on
this even though he didn't accept it
they he would be forced to say I do not
accept reparations even after I formed
that commission or he's going to say
it's still on the table and I haven't
decided either one of those he can't win
he cannot win because there are a lot of
white people in a lot of States who say
what if he gets away with that in
California and he does it my state is
going to be talking about that
tomorrow and I'm going to pay because
hair gel
Hitler you know did this clever thing in
California that is the most
disqualifying issue of all issues I've
ever
seen I mean he literally would be
running for
president uh on a platform that he won't
guarantee taking money from white people
to give it to people of other
races not just
taxes but just take their money because
they're white
because they're
white and give it to black
people because they're black how do you
get elected with that it's impossible
yeah no there isn't any way he can be
elected at to national office so all
those of you who said and by the way I
used to think this too that he would
have a serious shot at getting elected
no he can't as long as reparations out
there he cannot get elected there
there's no way he's going to get enough
white votes to make that happen
uh Rumble is under attack big surprise
because you know rumble's a source of
free speech and uh so you you you had to
know that the government would come
after them sure enough there's this
short seller uh this is a claim from the
president of Rumble that a short seller
put together a report of sent
it to the secc and the SEC said we're
looking into it because somebody had
reported there's some then the
same person who reported it goes to the
press and says hey don't look at me but
the SEC is is says this is serious now
what a short seller is is somebody who
makes money if they can identify a
company whose stock is going to drop
like a rock so one of the dirty tricks
they do is create the news that makes
the stock drop so that they can make
that you know quick
cash uh
okay
and
so uh so rumble's story is that it's
completely illegitimate will be easily
dismissed you know the the claims
against them are something about the
claims have something to do with whether
they properly accounted for something
Financial the response again not in a
legal context but just from the
president is that they always
anticipated this kind of attack and so
they had a bulletproof accounting
exactly for this reason and all they
have to do is show it and that's it'll
go away but in the
meantime yeah it's like swatting that's
that's exactly right in the comments on
locals somebody said it's like swatting
a stock that's exactly right it's like
swatting a
company so is there anything to the
claim well we don't
know but we do know that the person
making the claim according to the
president of Rumble is a financial
motivated person who would benefit
whether it was true or
not right so the claim from Rumble is
that the source of the accusation is
somebody who would make a lot of money
even if it's not true so that so you
should judge its credibility at exactly
zero does that make sense for a
riskmanagement kind of understanding the
world um basis it doesn't mean it's not
true doesn't mean mean it's not true but
you should judge its
credibility actually zero because there
somebody has a a financial motivation a
gigantic one and they're in the business
of doing this very kind of thing so no
this is not this is not a believable
accusation but like I say sometimes
accusations are true even if they don't
seem credible when they're made so you
can't rule anything out but I wouldn't
give it any credibility at this at this
stage
and um oh I guess I I full
disclosure uh I'm sorry I should have
disclosed this uh I am a stockholder in
Rumble so I owned an initial investment
very small one in locals which got
acquired by Rumble which allowed my
stock to roll over into Rumble so I'm a
stockholder at a much higher price and
the last I saw it was in the 3es I think
it went public around
12 and now the short seller drove it
down down to about
three so the short selling works I mean
it's a dirty trick but it works so I'm
holding my
stock considering doubling it but that
is not Financial advice that would be
pure gambling let me say that again I'm
considering doubling my holding but it
would be a super risky play I do not
recommend you do that that it's pure
risk just pure gambling right but the
play would be this and again don't
follow my advice do not follow my
financial advice on this or anything
else unless I tell you to diversify your
portfolio if I tell you to diversify
listen to that right if I tell you to
buy or sell a specific stock do not
listen to that or anybody else right but
I'll tell you the thinking uh investing
investing makes most sense when you
think you have special Insight that the
market doesn't have you're usually wrong
which is why you shouldn't do this but
here's my special
Insight it is more likely true that
Rumble is being unfairly attacked than
it is likely to be true that the
accusations are
true now I don't know what the odds are
but it's not
5050 it is definitely you know weighted
heavily toward it not being true now if
it turns out that the SEC goes through
it and it's not true you'd expect maybe
a at least a 25% bump in the
stock so that would be reason that a
rich person only a rich person don't do
this if you're
struggling might gamble you know just
because it's kind of a fun gamble but I
do gamble that the news is wrong when I
invest that's a common method I've used
don't don't use that method it but it's
just one that I use to some effect I
wouldn't say it works all the
time well Delta Airline is racist uh
Robbie Starbuck reports on
xplatform um he showed a photo of a
Delta Airlines training that says they
instruct their employees to capitalize
the words black and brown when talking
about people uh but to lowercase
white that are you okay with
that to capitalize black and brown but
not white even when used in the same
context about talking about
people no that's completely racist and
Delta you are
despicable yeah if this is true I mean I
saw a photograph of it but you know
anything could be faked if it's true
this is pure racism and by the way
that's the definition of racism treating
people differently in a in a official
sense right individuals are different
but a company doing it would be racism
yeah individuals can do whatever they
want there's no law against
that all right uh you all know probably
the story if you're following the news a
lot of an American Independent reporter
named gonzala lra who is reporting very
inconvenient things from Ukraine and he
was reporting things that the leadership
Ukraine would not want to see he was put
in jail and reportedly he has died in
prison and some say he died from poor
Medical Care some people say he was
murdered uh David saaks points out and I
agree what's the
difference they put him there to take
care of him you know if he died because
they gave him bad service or he died
because they strangled him they killed
him right so the Ukrainian government
killed an American but at least uh
America tried really hard to get him out
uh because he was unfairly accused right
nope nope it looks like America let him
die because he was also saying things
inconvenient to
America he was for example and I don't
know the truth of any of these
accusations I'll just say he's making he
made these
accusations that the war in Ukraine was
largely uh Victoria nuland American
Victoria nuland uh being a bully and
having you know bad
motivation I have no independent you
know knowledge of what she did or didn't
do but that was his accusation and a lot
of people said this by the way the
Tucker Carlson um often says Victoria
nuland is you know the the center
of the uh the war machine that likes to
profit from war the neocons the neocons
as they say now I don't know about any
of that but that's his accusation and a
lot of other people's accusations
but he went on I saw a video of
gonzala before he died because the
videos of him after he died
or less interesting really but before he
died he was uh he had the following
theory that I for some reason I didn't
know now I don't know if it's
true but I certainly should have heard
about it and here's
um yeah here here's what he said about
Ukraine he said there's this uh
billionaire who um funded and he was
sort of behind the production company
that created a TV
show about a Ukrainian guy who became
president and he hired
zalinski and zalinski was the star of
the show uh what was the name of the
show something of the people servant of
the people was that the name of the the
TV
show give me give me a confirmation on
that so servant of the people all right
so the TV show was called servant of the
people and zalinsky was a star
and um part of what uh Gonzalo lero
reports is that for reasons that are
mysterious it was a gigantic hit now
what makes that mysterious is it wasn't
really that good a
show but it had massive like
advertising some some kind of massive
support so it looked like it was sort of
artificially pushed to the top of the
market by powerful forces now here's the
interesting
part then the same billionaire who
funded the TV show allegedly again none
of this is from me this is from
allegations uh allegedly created a
political
party and he called it the same name as
the TV
show servant of the people and then they
needed a
candidate so he picked zinsky who had no
political experience but he had made him
super popular as an actor pretending to
be a
president and then you know nobody
believes that elections in Ukraine are
true so then zilinsky becomes
president did the US help probably what
was that their intention were they
working with this billionaire well I
don't know if they were colluding with
him but they might have been they might
have had compatible interests at one
point it's
unclear um but it gets better if you if
you think that's the good part of the
story you haven't heard the good star
now again these are only accusations the
same billionaire um owned either a lot
of or most of another company you might
have heard of it's called Uh
bisma that's right the same billionaire
who owned barisma that was paying Hunter
Biden and 10% of that theoretically was
going to the
boss was putting
zalinski as a puppet in charge of the
Ukrainian government and maybe the
entire operation was a coordinated
effort to use Ukraine as a piggy bank
destroy the country suck its resources
out La money and also maybe give Putin a
hard time which would be just a bonus
now is any of that
true I don't
know all I know for sure is that the guy
saying it just got killed by Ukraine and
America didn't complain so the
suggestion
is everything seems to be compatible
with it being true what would be
incompatible with this being true is
there any counterfactual to it I mean
it's hard to prove a negative of course
so it doesn't mean it's
doesn't mean it's true just because you
don't have an argument against it
but it's feeling really
true right yeah I'm it's I'm very biased
by the fact that everything that we've
imagined as a conspiracy theory ends up
being pretty close to
true
so probably I'll tell you what I believe
to be true you know based on not just
this story but the the totality of
information it does seem to me that
Ukraine was always a piggy bank for the
billionaires and the political class it
does seem that American politicians have
been wetting their beaks in Ukraine
possibly for decades
and uh it's exactly what it looks like
and that the war was optional and that
um killing people to make money is the
business of America and killing our own
citizens to make money is a critical
part of that that that's what it looks
like it looks like the bidens are uh
deeply involved in that part of the
world so I don't know what true but
that's what it looks like and it looks
like that American government and the
Ukrainian government conspired to kill
an
American so let me let me say that
directly I don't know that it's true but
the evidence strongly suggests that the
Biden Administration killed an American
to keep him quiet now killed him by not
ref freeing him which could have been
easily done
because obviously American can get
zalinsky to free anybody we want would
you agree if the president said to
zilinski all right here's the deal I
don't care what he's charged with he's
an American let him
go zinsky would have put the key in the
door five minutes
later zilinski isn't going to ruin
Ukraine over one reporter in
jail nobody would make that tradeoff
right so you can know for sure that
America wasn't interested in his life or
wanted him to die in jail so I would say
it's a case of
murder the the evidence suggests that
the Biden Administration and Joe Biden
specifically because he would be the
boss the the evidence suggests that
Biden was part of a plot to murder an
American
citizens yeah now maybe Murder By
statistics now what I say by Murder By
statistics is you put him in a situation
where he's probably going to die
a Ukrainian prison probably going to die
now you could say well that's not
technically murder because you didn't
cause that you just put him in a
situation where he's probably going to
die no I call that murder that's called
Murder yeah we got Britany grinds out
wait we got Britany grinder out of
Russia you don't think we could get an
American out of
Ukraine all right yeah so I would say
that the official stories are
ridiculous the accusations are wild but
they fit the
facts that we
know all right so um let me ask you
this uh do you see a lot of uh news
today about the war in Ukraine
anybody did did you see the the news is
just covered with no no there's a big
old war over there and suddenly the news
isn't interested huh
weird isn't it it's like they're all
coordinated or something suddenly it
just got uninteresting didn't it yeah
how about uh all the coverage on Gaza
today Gaza it's just wall to wall what
nothing oh nothing about Gaza the other
War we're in yeah how about the war in
Yemen we we know that we attacked Yemen
and I guess it happened again you know
two days in a row but massive coverage
with lots of details s
right
nope nope why would there be so little
media
coverage of the United States being in
three different
Wars well it might have something to do
with some comments that Donald Trump
recently made on true social that got
promulgated on
acts he and uh Trump said that Joe Biden
got us into three different Wars
Ukraine you know Gaza situation
Yemen uh and that he's the worst
president in the history of the United
States so Trump is pushing the idea that
uh that Joe Biden is a war
starter and the news just went silent on
three
Wars right in front of you they right in
front of you right it it's not like I'm
coming up with some conspiracy theory
you know there are three
Wars and you can look at the news and
you can see that they're clearly
intentionally underplaying them because
it would not work to their
narrative now I like uh Trump's
persuasion when he says that Biden is
the worst president in the history of
the United
States what's he doing there what
persuasion trick is that that I've
taught you many times yeah he's making
you think pass the sale that he's a
terrible president if you're thinking
whether he's the worst you've already
accepted that he's in the you know the
bottom 10% or something and that would
be enough right now in my
opinion he actually is the worst
president in the history of the United
States I do think he surpassed Jimmy
Carter would you agree because Jimmy
Carter kind of classically was
considered the worst president but I
think Biden has now surpassed him now to
be be
fair Biden has some
successes he has some successes but
probably Jimmy Carter did
too so it's not about the fact he had
some successes it's also about what you
got wrong and starting three Wars plus
one on our Southern border which you're
ignoring the the only one that affects
the
Homeland the only one that affects the
Homeland he's
ignoring that is worst president in the
history of the United States if the only
thing I told you was he got us involved
in three Foreign Wars and didn't protect
us from the active Invasion on their
southern border would you need to know
anything about his economic policy to
decide who is the worst president no you
not would you need to know his views on
lgbtq to know he's the worst president
in the history of the United States no
you would not you wouldn't need to know
that it wouldn't be relevant to the
overall all obvious characterization of
his presidency which is basically
starting Wars that probably didn't need
to be started uh getting us involved
using up our weapons shipping using up
all our oil and our strategic reserves
giving away all our artillery
shells it just goes on and on the worst
president in the history of the Republic
I I think that's just obvious now you
know no matter what you think of trump
or anybody else I think he's pretty
clearly the worst and the fact that he's
not even really conscious and able to
even show up at events I mean how did we
allow that to be
normalized you know I I always give this
quote from my mother she always used to
say you can get used to anything if you
do it long enough and that explains so
much of the world like why things are
doing the thing doing what they are
did I declare a race
war there's a article did Scott Adams
declare a race war um typical uh
election year kind of social media
activity anyway
um that's where we're at um yesterday as
a public service and uh I know that
sounds like a joke but actually was uh
as a public service I spent uh hours
putting together a debunk of the F of
the drinking bleach hoax the reason I
did it is because it just hadn't been
done and nobody in the news had ever
done it and it was one of the biggest
stories of all time and nobody had ever
covered it let me say that again one of
the biggest stories of the Trump
presidency that he said hey you should
drink bleach which of course never
happened it was a hoax and the major
media
has never covered the story just think
about that is that all you need to know
about the uni
party do you ever remember uh Fox News
doing the investigative report uh
showing exactly what happened and how
the hoax was created nope nobody else
ever did it either so I did it so you
can see it on locals but um I I link to
it on X so look at my feed of the
uh the drinking bleach hoax now I'll
give you I'll tell you what's there so
you'll see the entire transcript but I
highlighted so that you don't have to go
through the whole thing the parts where
he mentioned
light so when you see the whole thing
it's so super clear what
happened and of course people are still
denying it even after they read
it but here's what you need to know when
he when he teased his guest and said you
know I've got the this guest he said
there's like a really exciting exciting
news and then the guest came out and
said we tried various things to kill the
virus on external surfaces we tried some
bleach we tried some isopropyl but let
me tell you compared to those things
what really worked is light so light was
really the topic light was mentioned 21
Times by either Trump or somebody else
as the main topic of the event were you
aware of that
how many of you knew that the main theme
was about light as a disinfectant did
the news tell you
that no no and and what did the experts
say about bleach and isopropyl and
liquid
disinfectants the only thing they said
about them is that that they don't work
anywhere near as good as light now do
you remember the part where Trump talked
to Dr Burks at the same event in public
and he said will the light work on
porous
surfaces meaning
skin and the doctor said well probably
works better on non-porous servfaces but
yes you know you would expect it would
work a little bit but maybe not as good
so now we have clarification that when
PR when Trump said something really
exciting is going to be revealed he did
not mean bleach and he did not mean
isopropyl because you know what every
person already knew that those things
kill viruses am I right everybody
already knew the whole country every
citizen every person knew that
disinfectants killed viruses on surfaces
the only thing new that was presented
was that light was a
superstar the whole point of the thing
light is a
superstar did you know
that the news didn't tell you that it
was all about about light as a superstar
so the news didn't tell you that there
was a trial of light and that the Wall
Street Journal talked about it after
that event that there was a company IU
bioscience that said yes that's us we're
putting light in a catheter putting it
down the throat I.E injecting it into a
body to see if it works turns out it
didn't work as well as they wanted but
it was being trialed at the time and
Trump knew about it how do I know that
Trump knew about it because I was
tweeting it two days before the event
and other people were retweeting it and
we know that his staff and he looked at
that news and we also know that he's
drawn to things that are good news he
he's especially drawn to hearing this
there might be a solution there might be
some good news so did his staff tell him
about something that would be exciting
and might be good news
probably probably they told them because
it's exactly what he wants to hear tell
me some good news about something that
might be working so I can tell that
story and so that's why he was excited
now you want some more confirmation that
he was only talking about light because
people still say he wasn't here it
is when the experts said we tried the
the bleach and the isopropyl it did Kill
the virus but it would take you know a
while several minutes but when we tried
light boom two minutes gone so light was
the two-minute one the other ones take
much longer so when Trump was talking
about disinfectant he said and look and
it could kill it in one minute and he
repeated one minute more than once there
was only one topic of one disinfectant
that could work in the know the experts
said two minutes and Trump did his usual
trumpian thing of making one minute but
there was only one thing that was ever
discussed that could be that quick it
was always
light and and if you look at all the
references Trump made to light he never
once talked about anything that was
wasn't light not once but he did however
use the word disinfectant in the middle
of a discussion about light so people
put that one word out now how did the
hoax get created when he very clearly
was talking about only light Jim aosta
asks a question of one of the experts he
says well you wouldn't put these you
know bleach and isopropyl and
disinfectants into your body would you
or I'm paraphrasing something like that
and the expert said no no no you
wouldn't do
that so Jim aosta started the hoax by
pretending he didn't understand that it
was always about light that's how the
hoax was created so once he pretended
that he he thought he heard that it was
about these other
things then the rest of the news just
picked it up and it became became the
hoax yeah so that's how it happened now
what you should learn from it is how
hoaxes are creative you know we can't go
back in time it doesn't really matter at
this point but if you learn that they
can so easily create a hoax and here are
the mechanics the first mechanic is you
take something and a
context so they had to cut off his many
references to light and they had to
completely remove his conversation with
Burks same event on the stage in public
they to remove the whole bur's
conversation because that would be so
obvious that he was talking about skin
the whole time
I mean really obvious so they had to
just get rid of it so they get rid of it
and then if you want to see the
transcript they'll show you just the
parts that are edited and you think you
actually saw the transcript but you
didn't or they'll show you the entire
transcript which is 35 pages and you
it's just too much work to pick out what
happened so I did that for you so I took
the whole transcript but you don't need
to read it because I've highlighted just
the half dozen places that matter
so you could just read
those so for the first time in the
history of America somebody explained
how the fine how the drinking bleach
hoax started in great detail you can see
it yourself there's no question about
it but what you should learn is that
they can do a selective edit that's how
the fine people hoax started it's how
the Covington kids thing was pushed it's
how the overfeeding the koish hoax was
pushed yeah it's called a rupar because
it's a selective edit but then the
second part of it is that somebody takes
it out of context and then all the rest
of the media pretends that was a
reasonable interpretation so it's the
repetition over and over that turns it
into the hoax it's not just the
misinterpretation it's the
repetition yeah a wrap-up smear I don't
know if that's a wrap-up smear but it's
in the same category
all right
um so yeah we don't know about Yemen
it's all fog of War stuff so I don't
have much to say about
that um don't you
think do you think we're being
suckers because it seemed pretty obvious
that Yemen was begging us to attack if
you attack somebody who very clearly
wants you to attack like Hamas and Gaza
are you really
winning makes you wonder makes you
wonder what winning looks like if you're
killing people who wanted you to attack
them and kill them at least a little bit
I don't know so I don't know if we're
winning or not but let me ask you a
question that nobody's
asked since we know for sure that these
are all Iranian proxies so Hamas is
Iranian proxy Hezbollah is the hoodies
hoodies in the blow ship the and the the
attacks in Syria and Iraq and American
forces all r
do the Iranians not have any
ships what am I
missing not one Iranian ship have we
blown out of the
water yeah can you tell me that this
would be hard to solve if uh V or Trump
were president let me let me solve it
for you hey
Iran you use the Red Sea
too if I see one more missile
come from your proxies in Yemen we're
going to take out your biggest
tanker and if it happens again we're
going to take out your second biggest
tanker oh but we will retaliate we will
retaliate so hard
yep did you hear the part about if you
take out our Iranian tanker but we'll
retaliate really
hard
yep and then you're
done it was that
hard no instead we've got bedridden
Lloyd Austin
like attack I feel so
confident well at least we don't have
the dementia patient making the military
uh decisions instead we have the guy uh
in the hospital
bed so fear us fear us our hospitalized
guy and our dementia guy are coming for
you uh don't worry about our lack of
artillery at least we don't need any
artillery in this
case or do we maybe we
will
um all right so the Biden campaign uh
has told CNN to tell the rest of you
that uh what they expect is that the
undecided voters have not been paying
attention and that as soon as they
realize that the race will actually be
Biden versus Trump Trump then all those
undecided people are going to go what
what and they'll they'll line up for
Biden and then Biden will win do you see
the
play so there's a narrative
forming for why everything's going to
change at the last
minute that's literally happening right
in front of you what would you do if you
were going to rig elections and you knew
it you would start about now
to tell a story about how all the people
who haven't quite shown up in the
polling are going to show up and there's
a good reason why it'll be toward the
end well that's
convenient but they're not
wrong I don't think they're
wrong do you know how many people in the
general public have heard of just heard
of f
ramaswami have you tried asking your
Normie friends what they think about V
what do they
say every person I've asked who isn't
like a real political person every
person who's just a
normie they say the same thing who you
know aake
ramaswami running for president
Republican he's all over social media
and they say yeah it doesn't ring a
bell what do you think causes that well
some of it is the media coverage but a
lot of it is that the uh the undecided
really are not paying attention the
undecideds no they can just kind of wait
till the end and make a decision the
week of election day if they want to
there there's no rule against that so
you do have to remember how uninvolved
the public is and I agree that if the
anti-trump people realize that he's the
guy they might form up on the other side
that's possible it's a little bit more
possible that Joe Biden's obvious
decline will be so bad in less than a
year that he will literally be a
vegetable and he's still going to win
probably all right
um a Biden spokesperson Michael Tyler
who's the uh let's see he a Biden
communications director Michael Tyler he
said this and I want to see if this
sounds like the iest thing any American
has ever said in any context that's a
big claim right the scariest thing that
any American has ever said in any
context I'm going to see if I can meet
that do you think I can meet that the
scariest thing any human has said in any
context here it is direct
quote uh talking about Biden he says
quote the president looks looks forward
to spending the next 10 months reminding
the American people how dangerous Donald
Trump and his Mega agenda are for
Americans pocketbooks their freedoms and
their
democracy you know I don't mind when our
presidential candidates lie you know
kind of expect it I don't mind some
exaggeration some
hyperbole kind of expected I don't even
mind when they try to scare you
because usually they're scaring you
about something real I didn't mind when
Trump said uh you should be scared about
the
Border I didn't think I should be that
scared but I thought that was just good
politicking because the Border was a
real problem
obviously and it did bring in real real
crime Etc along with good people
but um that was fair because it was a
dangerous situation maybe he exaggerated
it some would say maybe not if You' look
at current events but fear does make
sense when you're a leader and there's
something you need to be afraid of so
you can act on it I get that but you
know what you don't need to be afraid of
the mega
agenda the mega agenda is literally
about keeping you safer that's almost
the entire thing how can I keep you
safer how can we avoid you know being a
dictatorship how can we you know keep
America as some kind of Republic if it
ever
was so the fact that the way um Biden is
forming this is in
Revolutionary Civil War terms is
actually the scariest thing I've ever
heard an American
say that is the scariest thing I've ever
heard and it's scary because it's not
true if it were true it it might also be
scary but it would at least be in the
service of you know some some benefit
and I'd be like okay but to actually say
this when it's very obviously not true
uh that democracy is at
stake that's that's some dangerous
dangerous stuff to put into the American
World all right let me tell you my
current thinking very biased by all the
stuff I see um my current thinking is
it's very unlikely that America has been
a real Republic probably for a long time
if ever if ever to me it seems sort of
obvious that the pretend stuff we do
voting for things is not how anything
happens now I don't know who's in charge
or if it changes or you know if it's
some billionaires fighting it out and
then we just find out who wins later I
don't know exactly what's happening but
I do know there's very little evidence
that we live in a genuine Republic where
the where the citizens become informed
and then choose their leader I don't
think that's happened maybe for a long
time and when you look at the lack of
interest from both parties in fixing our
election system now there are members
who who do ask for it a lot but as a
group neither the Republican Party nor
the Democrats seem to show any real
interest in fixing it because each of
them controls States and one has to
assume that they like controlling the
their state and winning in their state
every time because they control the
election so they don't want to give it
up and maybe it would you
know so I think under that situation the
working assumption is that we don't live
in a republic we live in a a kleptocracy
in which there's some group of
billionaires who have figured out how to
game the system to make more billions of
dollars that's what it seems like so I I
would say that um
I don't feel like I've ever been part
of uh a
republic that's my current opinion now
again I can't say that that's
truth I I like to use the phrase a
working
assumption because it it fits the facts
better if if the facts were more
compatible with us being a real you know
democratically driven Republic then I
would favor that you know I would take
that as my view but the facts really
strongly argue against it you know the
entire situation with Trump I don't
think it could be much more clear than
that yeah all right
so that ladies and gentlemen is my
