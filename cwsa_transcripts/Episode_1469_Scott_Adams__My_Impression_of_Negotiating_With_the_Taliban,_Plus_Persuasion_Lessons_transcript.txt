[Music]
hey everybody
it's time yeah it's time for coffee with
scott adams
best time of the day every single time
and if you'd like to
enjoy it until the maximum potential all
you need is a couple of more glasses of
tanker chelsea's die in a canteen jugger
flask a vaseline guide
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of
the day thing makes everything better
what's it called that's right
simultaneous
it happens now go
well you're probably hearing a little
bit of a hum from my air conditioning
that'll turn off in a moment
if you get bad sound on one of these
platforms switch to the other
so at the moment i'm on youtube you
could define me by searching for real
coffee with scott adams
or you can find me on locals and you
have subscribers uh of course
but at the moment both platforms are
open so you can see them both if one of
them is not working just go to my
twitter feed you'll see the link to the
other that i sent today
all right
here's the first item today as you know
larry elter is running for governor in
the recall election with gavin newsom
he's the leading person who's not gavin
newsom and it looks like he's got a real
shot
he's definitely in striking distance
and uh full disclosure um
larry elder did reach out to me
and
you know asked me to communicate with
his uh team which which uh i plan to do
but
i thought i'd test this out his slogan
his current slogan if he hasn't changed
in the last few days is i'm in it to win
it i'm in it to win it
now i thought that was a little bit too
much about him
and not enough about the state
so i i did a little twitter poll very
unscientific and i said which do you
like better as a slogan for larry elder
i'm in it to win it or
make california livable again
now i chose the livable part
because that captures all the problems
from the
the fact that i can't go outside today
because there's
too much smoke in the air from forest
fires
to the fact that i can't go to a
restaurant without my mask on to the
fact you know just you know crime you
name it
i don't have electricity water reliably
anyway so we've got all kinds of live
livability problems high taxes etc so i
thought that captured a lot so what i
did in my uh
in my twitter feed i did that little
poll and 90
said they like make california livable
again
and nine
a little over nine percent said
his original slogan was better now
does that mean he should switch
immediately to make california livable
again no
because it's not a good slogan
it won you know ten to one
against his existing slogan but don't
use that one
it's a bad slogan because it's too
trumpy
and it creates a problem that you don't
need to create
because he's already going to be painted
with whatever hatred the the democrats
have for trump so you want to put some
distance there
and i would modify it instead of saying
it make california livable again which
sounds too much like make make america
great again how about just shortened to
let's make california livable
let's make california livable
so now it doesn't sound like you know
trump
but it also puts the livable in there
and it also says let's
meaning
you know working together so it gets rid
of the you know i'm in it to win it
which is a little too much about larry
and turns into something about making it
more livable but we're all working
together
so
is this sexy not really
not really so this is the way you would
work through this process
you would take some reasonable guesses
based on what you know about persuasion
about people
and then you'd have to test it
so if you think i can come up with a
winning
slogan just by brainstorming you're
wrong
i mean i could but it'd just be luck
uh more likely you just come up with a
bunch of ideas and test them until you
get one that works so that's how the
process works
the funniest uh response to
obama having his birthday party and then
i guess he pared it down from a larger
crowd to a still large but smaller crowd
and he had to go through the
embarrassing
process of uninviting people who had
been invited
imagine that can you imagine having a
party and inviting all these famous
people and then you have to
uninvite
the famous people
ouch
that's pretty rugged i can't think of
anything that would be more socially
awkward than uninviting all these people
who already made plans travel plans move
their schedule and these are important
people right so i guess people like
david axelrod got uninvited
now i'm not sure people like that matter
because they probably saw obama plenty
but
i think uh um
stephen colberg got uninvited one of the
people who got uninvited was larry david
and apparently larry david was worried
that they were going to ask him to do
some comedy there and he couldn't come
up with any good jokes for the situation
and so when they they called him and
told them that
he was uninvited
he screamed thank you thank you
then i hung up the phone poured myself a
drink and finished my crossword puzzle
now
you think to yourself
isn't that a terrible day when you get
uninvited to obama's birthday party like
you'd be all excited
i felt exactly like larry david did in
this
i remember hearing the story this is a
true story
about charles schultz being invited to
the white house i think during a reagan
administration or something
and charles schultz got invited to some
state dinner at the white house and he
turned it down
and i asked him why he turned turned
down an invitation to the white house
like who turns down an invitation to the
white house
seriously who turns that down
charles schultz does
you know why he turned it down
he said i already did that
he'd been there once
didn't see another reason to do it again
so when larry david turns down obama's
birthday party and feels like he just
avoided a
uh a bunch of work
i thought to myself
i think that's exactly how i would have
felt
if i had been invited and then uninvited
i would just feel relieved i'd be like
oh
thank god i don't have to make
conversation with beyonce
i'm just using her as an example i think
making conversation with beyonce would
be fun
let's talk about afghanistan even jake
tapper is
giving the biden administration a
serious spanking on cnn
asking them pointedly how they got it so
wrong now of course trump is not out of
the woods here because he started the
process and
you know maybe maybe the government was
bound by it but maybe not i mean we're
not really bound by it are we
any any agreements
so there's plenty of blame to go around
but biden gets the most of it because it
happens on his watch any i suppose he
could have pivoted and could have
changed something and then
but he also made the big mistake of
predicting it would go fine
who was it who advised biden all right
if they ask you how things are going to
go in afghanistan once once we pull out
our troops
tell them it'll be fine
who who gave him that advice
or did he come up with that on his own
like what did that look like did people
laugh when they said it
tell me it'll be fine
no seriously just just tell them tell me
to be fine
the taliban
flexible
if there's anything you can say about
the taliban
is those guys are flexible and they know
and they've gone too far
oh we've gone too far now we'll back up
a little bit
so that's how the taliban works well
do you believe that biden ever believed
that things would go fine and that we'd
train the afghan government to defend
itself
do you think he thought that
do you think anybody thought that do you
think trump thought that when he started
the process i don't think so
i think every single person knew
that the taliban would take over fairly
quickly i mean we're surprised at how
quickly it happened but
you knew it was going to happen right
did anybody not know what was going to
happen
and of course that's because the afghan
government is thoroughly corrupt and
can't be can't be fixed
so
did biden just lie to us
when biden told us things would be fine
was that what i would call a
convenient lie
because the thing that was going to
happen is we were going to withdraw
and
a lot of our allies who fought with us
and should not die
are going to be killed
we know that's going to happen
was it a good lie
meaning it was more benefit than than
cost was it a good lie
to tell the public oh yeah they'll be
fine
until the process is too far along to
stop it
because it's going to happen
right you can't really manage the
unmanageable it was going to happen
anyway so i think it gave the government
biden administration a little bit of
cover
so that they could say
oops
i wish i'd known that all of our allies
were going to be slaughtered
oops i mean if we'd known that in the
beginning
we wouldn't have pulled out because
we're not that kind of people
oops
who saw it i guess it was just a failure
of intelligence we tried really hard
guys we tried to save you but we didn't
see it coming
blindsided
it seems to be like it was an
intentional lie
we don't know because we can't read
biden's
adult brain
but it feels like he knew it was going
to happen and he just told us it wasn't
going to happen so that he could say
well i didn't see it coming
if i'd known all our allies were going
to be slaughtered
i would have tried harder to prevent it
but now we're out of afghanistan so i'm
not even sure i mind
do you
let me ask you in the comments
if you knew for sure that biden just
lied to the country and said yeah it'll
be fine
but it was the only way to get us out of
there
are you okay with that
because i actually am
if that was a bold-faced lie
i'm okay with it
because it would have been under this
hypothesis it would have been a lie for
the benefit of the country
that would have been maybe terrible for
the afghan people
but it would be america first
it would be something that was going to
happen anyway sooner or later
so yeah i mean you could have i think
you could allow for differences of
opinion on this
but
sometimes the government needs to lie to
you
and military
military operations are the one place
that we do give expl we expressly give
our government a permission to lie to us
right i mean kind of
we kind of say if it's in our interest
and we find out later that you lied to
us but as long as it was in our interest
we're going to be okay with that right
really in the real world we are
um and i'm wondering what the uh now
we're hearing that the afghan government
is negotiating with the taliban
and i'm wondering what that looks like
in the context of the taliban being on
the verge of taking over everything no
matter what
how does that negotiation go
well i'd like to give you my impression
of negotiating with the taliban
that's why you come here it's for the
impressions
and the impressions go like this
scene
um
mr taliban uh thank you for coming here
to negotiate with the afghan government
and
your first offer is very generous you've
offered to behead all of our children
and use their heads as soccer balls
for your fighters
and i'd like to push back on that a
little bit
and say that
perhaps
you could spare
two of my children two of my five uh use
three of their heads for soccer balls
and two of them just just leave them
alone
taliban says
i i understand your offer i can see why
you'd make that offer but here's my next
offer uh we're going to use all five of
your children's heads for soccer balls
and we're going to rape your wife in
front of you
and the afghan government guy says okay
okay i think we're making some progress
um how about
you you behead all five of my children
but you don't
hurt my wife
and the taliban says okay okay good
offer
here's what we'll do
we'll use your children's heads for
soccer balls we'll rape your wife in
front of you and kill her and then we'll
kill you so it doesn't bother you
and the afghan guy says
that would solve my problem
it is the best offer i'm gonna get
i guess i'll take it
i guess i'll take it
and that is what i call negotiating with
the taliban
scene
well
um or maybe they would just negotiate to
you could kill my in-laws
um anyway
so i would like to give you the most
optimistic thought about afghanistan
this will not happen
i'm not predicting this will happen but
it could happen
not impossible did you see the video of
the taliban finding all these perfectly
intact
stocks of weapons that we left behind
like all these big ass weapons you know
the rifles that are you know as big as a
car
and stuff you see the the taliban just
happily picking up all the major weapons
how many how many of those weapons do
you think have tracking devices in them
just asking
we left all this heavy equipment there
you don't think we have any tracking
devices in them
nobody thought of that
now i don't know
yeah i mean i'm saying in the comments i
thought of that
i mean half of you in the comments
thought of that
now i don't know how hard it would be
to locate the tracking devices in in
each of them but i don't feel that the
television are too sophisticated
i feel like
if they got some good heavy equipment
you could probably hide a tracking
device in one of them
couldn't you
secondly the process of taking over a
country guarantees that your fighters
are visible
and that where you meet people
it would be visible
and your armies would no longer be
spread out hiding they'd be right where
you could see them
if we wanted to
could we wait three weeks and destroy
the taliban completely
just because they'd be visible
either through the tracking devices
that may or may not exist or the fact
that once they're the legitimate
government
they're out in the open
they would probably have military
exercises they would all just be in one
place you could just bomb them all
together
i don't know i don't think it's worth uh
saving
anything in afghanistan i don't think
the government showed that it was worthy
of saving
um and i don't think we have any
interest there
i'm just saying
if it was a clever clever plan
it would have been kind of clever but
it's not going to happen
you saw me speculating i think it was
even yesterday that i didn't understand
the question
of how vaccinations could make more
variants
because that's a common thing that's on
the internet right a lot of people say
no the
vaccinations just create this filter
that might stop the regular virus but
the the variance will
will be you know
unleashed
to which i said
explain to me how having less infection
because that's what the
vaccine will do will cause fewer people
to be infected you can still get
infected if you have it but it would
vastly reduce the rate of infection at
least
how could reducing the rate of infection
create more variants
it seems to me without being a scientist
that the more virus there is in the
world the the more total amount of virus
in people
the more variants
how could that be wrong so if the
vaccine reduces the total amount of
people who could have the virus it's
still more than ever
but it's less than it would be without
the vaccination isn't that a smaller
pool of
of potential
variants
well it turns out that there was a
recent study the university of maryland
in which they showed the full
vaccination against covet actually
suppresses variants
exactly like i said
exactly like i assumed
how could how could more variants
uh not create
how can more virus not create more
variance and how could reducing the
total amount of variance
do anything but
decrease the risk of variance
so of course you know those are not the
only variables
yeah i'm sure i'm missing some
mechanisms there i can say that fairly
confidently
but it didn't seem to me that anybody
had ever described a mechanism in which
variance could be increased by
vaccination i'd heard experts say it
but when it came to well explain why
why does that do it
i never i never heard an explanation
so if this
if this study holds up and of course
remember studies are maybe 50 reliable
uh i've been criticized quite rightly
i'll say this would be one of those
criticisms that i accept uncritically
uh that i often say when a study agrees
with me it sounds pretty good
and when a study disagrees with me i say
well
kind of sketchy study
so i would say uh take that same warning
with this study it might not be true but
it does agree with me so that makes it
seem more credible than
yeah ask brett weinstein well i've
watched some of brett's content on that
but i don't think i ever saw
the mechanism
anyway my common sense told me it would
come out this way and so i did the study
but we don't know if either of us are
right yet
you probably saw on the internet a
graph that shows you who's the most
skeptical of vaccinations
and you find that the people with the
least education are the most skeptical
oh wait
also phds
so the two most skeptical groups are the
least educated
and the most educated
the people who are most comfortable with
vaccinations
are the people who have say a master's
degree or a four-year college degree so
they're not as educated as the phds but
they're far more educated than the
uneducated
so what's that tell you well it's been
it's been
passed around the internet as evidence
that the phds the most informed to
people are most skeptical and therefore
so should you be
because the smart people
are skeptical
do you buy that who's on board with that
thinking
if the phds are the most skeptical
shouldn't you be
right
well let me tell you some real world
information about phds
number one
what is your phd in
if your phd is economics
like andres backhouse you know i mention
all the time from twitter
if that's your if that's your phd
then yes yes you should definitely
listen to that person and give them a
little bit more weight
than somebody who doesn't have a degree
in economics because economics teaches
you decision making
it teaches you how to weigh the cost and
benefits of things now suppose you had a
phd in literature
what good is that
can you make better
better medical decisions because you've
got a phd in literature
in the
in the real world how many have had this
example watch watch the comments now how
many of you have worked in a big
corporation
and worked with people who have phds
uh were they were they the smart ones
did you notice that all the people with
the phds made all the good decisions
and the people who didn't have them
couldn't make good decisions
nope
nope
people who have a master's degree the
people who are the least skeptical would
be people like me
so i have a also a master's degree in
business
so if you have an mba
what do you learn
decision making
you literally got a degree and how to
make good decisions
risk analysis i've got two
one degree in economics teachers you had
to make decisions
one degree and you know and an mba
teaches you how to make decisions
so if you put me in the same room with a
phd in literature
who would you trust
it's not even close
it's not even close you would trust me
every time
if you're smart
which is not to say i'm right
right being right is slightly different
than being credible
well not slightly different completely
different than being credible
but phds are not credible
unless they have the right phd
and if you just average phds together
you get some weird soup of
people who are highly trained to make
decisions
so now let's compare me with my two
degrees
in decision making
can i analyze things as well as let's
say andre's backups with a phd in
economics
nope
nope i'm nowhere near as good as he is
at doing the same thing i'm traded at
the very thing i'm trained at he does
better than me because he has a higher
degree and proves it all the time so
yeah don't don't believe that the phds
are where you need to get your
your decision making from
all right how about this so vaccine
passports being rolled out in new york
city probably other places
and um i'm in favor of that
surprise
i'm just saying this to get all riled up
so there's a twist at the end
but i'm in favor of new york city
having a vaccine passports so you can't
do indoor stuff mostly i guess unless
you got one of those passports why am i
in favor of it
because i don't live there
i don't live in new york city
and i do think
that we should be testing different
processes in different places
so if new york city wants to test this
i think they should
because wouldn't you like to know if it
works
my my anticipation is that it won't work
meaning that there'll be no noticeable
difference
in the infection rate but don't you want
to test it
because
even if you're completely against
vaccination
passports and i i oppose them i'm one of
the people who post them but even if
you're completely against them
don't you want to know if they work
because we might have to make the
decision even if you don't like it you
could imagine
you could easily imagine
that we'll be forced into making a
decision we don't want to make at all
which yeah let's say there's another
variant and it's just it's just you know
death
maybe i'd like to know if it worked and
it's not my city so i'm glad somebody's
trying it at least we'll we'll find out
but i would add this to that
and again let me say clearly i oppose
vaccine passports in the united states
although if somebody wants to visit from
another country
maybe they need to be vaccinated
with the right kind of vaccination
but here's what i would add to this i
think if your doctor writes you a note
that says you're the kind of person who
has low bmi so you're not obese you're
the you're not too old let's say under
40 or 50 whatever your doctor decides
and you don't have other major
comorbidities
why can't your doctor write you a a
letter that says
that you're as good as but as good as
vaccinated
because in both cases you can get it i
guess being vaccinated a little less
chance of getting it but
um
i would think that that should count if
you can get a doctor to say
for whatever reason
that your risk is low
the whole point of the passport is to
have only low-risk people in in the room
right
so why not add that i know you're going
to add
add to that people who have
already got infected and can prove it
and i would add those as well i mean
your doctor could also test you
find out you have antibodies write you a
letter
so yeah if you're gonna do vaccine
passports you need to include all the
low-risk people because otherwise it's
just crazy
all right
how about hospital capacity let's put
this
under news of the day fake news fake
news
hospital capacity
this is fake news
why
which part is fake news is it fake news
that the hospitals are being crushed or
is it fake news that they're not because
you're seeing both right you're seeing
reports that some hospitals are crushed
and some are not well it turns out that
there's a hospital capacity checker
it's very good actually it's a i think
it's the cdc site it shows you every
hospital in the united states and color
codes them
by how how impacted they are so i
checked my local area and sure enough
there are hospitals that are at capacity
yikes
there are hospitals in my area which i
don't think is a hot spot at all
but the hospitals are at capacity
but
fake news fake news
only some of them are
others are low
they're not even high capacity they're
you know they're not even like toward
the top
they're like right in the middle
why is that why why is one hospital
at capacity and the one right next to it
is not
and how do you judge that
because don't you send people to other
hospitals for you know for
sharing capacity
somebody says because it's smaller
oh that's actually not a bad
theory location
well i'm saying that the locations are
near each other you know they're almost
walking distance and one is one is at
capacity and the other's not literally
walking distance
yes so i think some of the answer has to
do with specialty some of it has to do
with
i would guess some hospitals are
specialty for covent
have more capacity if you knew one
hospital was great at handling covid
wouldn't you send everybody there until
it reached capacity
i mean if if the best hospitals are at
capacity
kind of means you're doing everything
right
doesn't it but i don't know if that's
the case maybe it's not the best ones
that are at capacity
so here's what's true and what's false
some hospitals are at capacity in the
very same areas
as hospitals are nowhere near capacity
can somebody give me a little
explanation of why that is
wouldn't you expect all of the hospitals
to be sort of moving in unison
because as one fills up the capacity
moves over to the others and yeah maybe
there'd be a little lag
but wouldn't they be moving together
largely but they're not
some are largely
full and some are not
now
if if i had seen the results like my
entire area was very similar
then i'd say oh we're in trouble
but if it's only some hospitals and i
don't know how many 20 maybe look like
i don't know what that means
so i would say that the news we're
getting about hospital capacity is
either incorrect
or lacks some kind of context so we
can't really figure out if it's a
problem or not
you know the usual problem bad data
i have a feeling
that we may be seeing a long term trend
toward depopulating cities
because you know it started with a
pandemic of course but
i feel as if the long-term risk of
living in a dense place isn't worth it
anymore
because you don't need to live in a
dense place to have a job
because you can do everything remotely
now so that's different
you don't want the commute of course you
don't want the crime but mostly i don't
want to live in an area that's an easy
target
we're entering a time when an ordinary
person can build a weapon of mass
destruction
let me say that again
we're rapidly entering a time when an
ordinary person
can create a weapon of mass destruction
it would probably have a biological
agent and a small drone
and you could just
attack a city now if you had such
ability
you could personally make a mass weapon
where would you use it
would you come to my town
where everything sort of spread out
there are no high rises no no you would
never attack my town
because the number of people you could
kill would be low because we're sort of
spread out here you would only attack a
city so i've got a feeling that just
living in a city will be one attack
after another until they just become
depopulated
what's to say
many jobs cannot be done online you old
fool
right
but if you depopulate the city
uh
you have far fewer
jobs that need to be done in general
all right so i think cities are just
gonna in the long term will disappear
um but slowly
uh here's an interesting data i haven't
seen anybody talk about this but as you
know uh vaccine hesitancy has been very
high in the black population of the
united states
now we all know why
right you don't have to be like a genius
to figure out why black people would
have less trust in the government
has anything ever happened to black
people in this country
uh because because of the government
oh yeah yeah like everything
so yeah it makes complete sense that the
black population as well as it makes
sense that the
conservative population would be the
most hesitant but here's the interesting
part
the hesitancy has dropped rapidly among
black people
whereas everybody else's hesitancy is
also trending down meaning that
every day that goes by we know more
about the risk of the vaccination so it
makes sense that everybody's hesitancy
is going down
because they're working and and we
haven't seen people dropping dead you
know on the streets so much
so but why is black hesitation dropping
faster than everybody else's by a lot i
mean it's a very dramatic if you look at
the lines
and i'd say two reasons number one would
be whoever had the most hesitancy
probably is going to get the fastest
rate of drop just as we inform people so
it might be just that they started from
you know a different base than everybody
else could be the whole story
but um
i would add one little bit about it
which is
i think the black population in this
country like many others
are a i'll call it a micro culture
meaning that mostly you talk to yourself
uh which would be true for lots of
microcultures within the united states
you know if you're
hispanic or you're let's say you're in
the immigrant
culture
you
you probably talk to other immigrants a
lot so it doesn't surprise me
that the black
folks in the united states may have been
talking to each other
but now you know they're sort of
the information is so widespread that
you know everybody's getting it from
everywhere at this point so it kind of
makes sense that there would be a delay
just because the communication would
have to penetrate
you know let's say a culture that talks
to itself
and then once it did then it makes a
difference that's probably what's
happening
so there was an interesting
meme that went around
um
it looks like we didn't lose our signal
here after 28 minutes so i think the uh
locals platform must have fixed that bug
it wasn't a bug actually it was a
testing
a testing limit because we're still in
beta
looks like they took that limit off
anyway um
there was a meme that went around that
got a lot of play and i want to talk
about how persuasive it was so here's
here's what it was it was a little black
and white meme and there's a photo of
rod serling from the old twilight zone
series
and so it was a good image so that was
the first thing good and here's the text
he said imagine a vaccine so safe you
have to be threatened to take it and
then there's a picture of rod serling
and then at the bottom it says for a
disease so deadly you have to be tested
to know you have it
all right so i'll read it again as one
imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be
threatened to take it
for a disease so deadly you have to be
tested to know you have it
it's pretty good persuasion
now
it's good persuasion that won't change
anybody's mind
because people are locked in on their
opinions on the vaccinations and stuff
for the most part i mean it's a very
slow change
but let me tell you what works about it
number one is visual so the picture of
rod serling with the little swirly lines
like something weird is going on draws
you in if you've ever seen the
difference between a
tweet that has a
an image versus a tweet that's just text
the viral tweets are
mostly the ones with images
so just adding an image to a tweet so
here's your your first
recommendation if you're trying to build
uh users on or followers on twitter
add images
images get your retweets
so i signed up for a stock service stock
photos istock i guess i'm using
and so if i have a tweet that i think
could be viral and it's just going to be
text i'll get some generic uh image and
watch the retweets just go through the
roof
you can test it yourself it's very
it's a very obvious effect added image
and your retweets just jump so if you're
trying to build um twitter followers
without images you're really just
marching through quicksand there
the next thing is that the image of rod
serling is a great priming image
because there is over a certain age
young people don't know rod sterling but
over a certain age it's a very familiar
let's say it's an image you like you
understand it
as soon as you see it you you start
hearing the music
and you think oh it's a crazy world and
anything bizarre could happen so it's
perfect priming
so you got a visual
that's good great really
you got priming to make you think
twilight zoney before they've even done
that the language
and then it uses the word imagine it
says imagine a vaccine so safe i think
that word imagine
is strong persuasion now i'm speculating
here this is not based on some
scientific thing i've seen but
it makes sense based on everything i
know as a trained hypnotist i tell you
too often
that if you put somebody's mind into
imagination mode
you can persuade them
better than if you have them in critical
thinking mode and you can tell if
somebody's in imagination mode versus
critical thinking you can you can
identify it and if somebody's in
imagination mode then they let the rules
go for a while okay i'll imagine i'll
just use my imagination when you're
imagining everything's everything's
possible including changing your mind
if you're in data mode you're probably
locked in and you're going to reject any
data that doesn't agree with you anyway
so i think just telling somebody to
imagine
probably
i don't have
science for this but my guess is that it
primes you to be more persuaded
so i like that part
the next part is over simplification
especially if that over simplification
makes it sound clever
have you ever heard that people who are
funny have a good sense of humor are
considered smarter
it's true if you can make somebody laugh
they think you're smarter you just seem
smart
now it doesn't mean that you're smart
but you do seem smarter you know
apparently the studies show that
so if you could do a clever over
simplification which is what this meme
did
you sound
clever and you sound funny
and you sound smarter
now if you sound smart people are more
likely to accept what you said and if
you sound funny
people are more likely to accept what
you said because we like it
so the same reason you like rhymes
apparently there's science that says if
you make something rhyme
as in if the glove doesn't fit you must
have quit people will think it's more
persuasive just because it rhymes
that's that's been tested i mean it's
weird
but it's been tested
um so if you so i'll read it again and
watch how clever
this simplification is
imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be
threatened to take it
for a disease so deadly you have to be
tested to know you have it now the form
of it is not a rhyme
but it's rhyme-like because it uses the
same form for the first sentence as the
second you know to imagine something
that's so weird imagine something so
weird
so i think it sort of
hits what a rhyme does to your brain
without being awry
uh and it's clever now here's the part
that is completely illegitimate
imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be
threatened to take it well people aren't
really being threatened
they are certainly having their their
rights reduced
i'm not sure threatened is the right
word but it's a it's a good
oversimplification
and for a disease so deadly you have to
be tested to know you have it well
that's an oversimplification if you get
into the hospital
with low low oxygen and no other obvious
problem
you know you probably don't need to test
you probably start treating them before
you test
i'm guessing
if you came in with all of the symptoms
of covid
wouldn't they and you're like near
death's door
wouldn't they slap the regeneration
regeneron into your iv
before they even had the test to know if
you really had covet i think they would
i mean i don't know
but
so anyway these are oversimplifications
to the point of being false but they're
still still persuasive all right here's
something that we need for our
government we need somebody to negotiate
with our own government
now you say to yourself you know you
don't need that that's what congress is
for
congress negotiates with itself
and with the president
for the benefit of the people
no they don't
no they don't
congress negotiates for itself
they're trying to keep their jobs trying
to get elected their their incentives
are not yours
you're not even on the same game they're
trying to keep their jobs you're trying
to stay alive
it's different
so
what would happen if you had somebody
who could negotiate with your own
government
literally a negotiator
now i don't know how you can actually do
that but here's the point
we have this situation coming up where
our election systems we know are not
transparent
and they're not auditable now they're
not transparent in the sense that you
don't know what's happening in the
electronics you don't know what the
software is really doing
you don't know what the servers are
doing any of the any of the counting
stuff because we can't get access to the
code
and apparently you can't audit
everything because there are lots of
records that are lost and you know
people don't label things and there's
about 20 different reasons that you
can't actually audit these things as and
especially the
the digital portion is hard to audit so
here's what i would do
if i were
a negotiator for the public
i would say we're not going to vote
until you make the elections transparent
and auditable
i would literally say
here's the deal we're just not going to
vote
negotiating on behalf of the public
i'm going to say
we're done
you fix the election
and then we'll vote so that's what i
would negotiate no vote until you fix
the election
um
there's a quote i saw that's attributed
to mark twain but apparently he never
said this
but i like it anyway if voting made any
difference they wouldn't let us do it
that's another one of those
oversimplifications
like it's not true
but it's so simplified that it sounds
clever
so whoever said that's pretty clever
all right here's another thing i would
negotiate with the government
so your government is asking you to get
vaccinated and wear masks
in the united states
but at the same time they refuse to give
us the relevant data to support that
decision
the relevant data
to support the government telling you to
get vaccinations and wear masks
would be the number of deaths and
hospitalizations
in every state
from covent
filtered by age and and bmi
weight obesity
so if you don't give us that information
every day
we're not going to get vaccinated
and we're not going to wear masks
even though we know we should right
because
lots of times negotiating
is a process of telling telling somebody
that you'll hurt yourself
rather than make that deal
so you've got to be willing to hurt
yourself to negotiate well actually
so i would say if i were negotiating
with the government it's like yeah great
i know you want us to get vaccination
and wear mass how about no
how about no
until you give us the minimum
which is
every day
national news tell us the
hospitalizations
and the deaths from covid by state
filtered by age and bmi
then i'll then we'll be on board
all right
so
we need a negotiator i saw a user named
abacus on twitter
saying this uh
replying to something i tweeted he says
now we're getting medical advice from
cartoonists
uh are you smarter than a fifth
grader well what do you think about that
getting medical advice from a cartoonist
is that a fair statement yes yes that's
very fair
uh it's definitely fair to question the
medical qualifications of a cartoonist
you should
if you're not if you're not questioning
my medical qualifications
why aren't you
you should be
right if you're taking medical advice
from cartoonists
better have a good reason
but
so i agree with that part for sure
but it's also a fact
that if you took my advice instead of
the experts you would have done better
that's just the fact you can check my
track record
you can see what i recommended you see
what the experts recommended you just
compare it
and it probably isn't an accident
because getting back to the earlier
point
number one i pick my spots
so do you have you seen me give an
opinion on everything that there is
medical about the covid stuff no
no because i'm not an expert and i
wouldn't have anything to add
but there are these specific things
such as
well you know you've heard you've heard
all the examples there are specific
things that you can just tell our lies
for example when the government first
told us that mass don't work and you
shouldn't use them and by the way i'm
not going to argue whether they do or
don't because that won't matter to this
next point
i knew the government was lying and so i
called it out now it could turn out
it's possible that they were right the
first time and mass are useless
could be
you know i'm open to that
but
i knew that they didn't believe it
i knew that and so i called it down
publicly and i was right they didn't
believe it they changed they changed as
soon as they
admitted that they were lying to
conserve supply
so
my qualifications and the only thing i
put forward as expertise is that i can
identify better than other
people
so if you're looking to somebody to
identify
i wouldn't go to a doctor
they're not trained to do that i would
go to me
or i would go to you know andre's back
house phd in economics somebody who's
trained to do it so
if you want medical advice
don't listen to a cartoonist
if you want somebody who will call
on somebody else's medical advice
talk to me
i can do that
i can i can call on stuff
but so so partly the reason that my
medical uh
my medical track record is better than
the experts is that i only pick the
things i'm pretty sure are so
it's easy it's easy to cherry pick the
things i talk about so yes absolutely my
track record is better than the experts
it's just a fact
but it's because i pick easy targets
all right i believe
that is just about everything i want to
talk about today
is there anything i missed
um
call bs on cuomo i think everybody's
done that
uh
bs meter okay
um hasn't done studies on mask
effectiveness the cdc
can't do
studies of covet mask effectiveness they
can't do that
because you need a control group and
they're not going to tell some people to
not wear masks
when you get the booster jab well you
get the same kind good question
if you got let's say i got the moderna
two two shots so far
if i get a booster
would i get the same one
my understanding is
that you might get some benefit from
getting a second one
can anybody confirm that i think that's
a supposition that's untested i i saw
some
i saw some speculation from some people
who knew what they were doing
that um
adding them together might
make them more effective but as i'm
seeing in the comments that would also
be something that never been tested
now we've never tested the boosters
right because we didn't do the initial
whatever we did for the emergency
authorization did not include boosters
so the booster takes some risk with it
but also i would imagine combining any
two different vaccinations is something
that hasn't been tested
so i would guess
that there's some added risk
but remember the the risk of all this
stuff starts high on day one
you know when you first roll it down but
as you can observe data over time the
the the risk of the unknown you know
drops pretty fast
so after six months of vaccinations
the risk of the unknown is pretty low
when you talk masks without specifying
the grade of mask you know it's all bs
now no that's not fair
the experts
say sydney powell was a mark for
i want to read this comment mark for
election interference uh what's your
blind spot
how would i know my blind spot
um is that the problem it's not really a
blind spot if you know it anyway i was
going to say that the experts say that
all the mass makes some difference and
some are better than others
um
there's some suggestion that the j j
vaccine would be a should be a booster
yeah but again
who tested that stuff
um
yeah i'm anti-mask at the moment
because i would agree with those who say
that the the difference in the mask
squaring no longer
you know whatever difference it gives
you
probably doesn't justify the
lack of freedoms that would be caused by
that's my current thinking
um
oh j g a j can't be a booster no i
wouldn't call if you added the j and j
shot
to either moderna or pfizer
uh you would probably wouldn't call it a
booster
because it's not boosting them it's just
adding
its own thing
so i don't know that that means you
can't do it
i think you just maybe wouldn't call it
a booster
but it would act the same way
um
all right
uh masks are child abuse
oh
there's a suggestion for a larry elder
say uh slogan bring back california
maybe sounds a little bit too much like
again
um
all right just looking at some more of
your comments
uh
three shots why not take five
well you probably will get five i mean
they are talking about infinite
vaccinations now
and i don't know if that's good or bad
build california better
yeah i'm not sure i like build
build doesn't sound like an
inspirational word
make does make is a good word
but it was used
imagine a livable california that's not
bad
so somebody said imagine a livable
california
it's not bad
yeah i'm not sure
yeah that's not bad
that's one i would test
i can't tell you that's good or bad but
that's test worthy
make the golden state golden again no i
don't think you want make and again in
there it's too trumpy
it just adds a reason to not vote for
him you don't need that
free california now that's interesting
free california
yeah
let's see
after the
prednisone debacle you're still willing
to engage the medical industry
what was my option am i supposed to
disavow all
medical care
because the medical industry makes
mistakes
how would you play it
just ignore health care well there are
people who die from
medical accidents i better never go to a
doctor again
no probably works for some people
prednisone makes you heavy well i'll
tell you i ate like a mofo
you can't you can't stop eating on
prednisone that stuff i mean your body
just needs food like crazy
or it wants it i don't know if it needs
it all right that's all for now i will
talk to you all
tomorrow
