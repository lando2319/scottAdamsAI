um
oh
I hope my nose printed out
hello everybody and welcome to coffee
with Scott Adams will it be the best
time you've ever had in your life
so far yes it will be guaranteed double
your money back if I disappoint but I
won't and all you need is a cover mugger
a glass of tanker Charles it's not in
the canteen Joker flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine the other day the thing
that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous Sip and
aren't you glad you made it in time for
that yeah
yeah here it comes go
well our audio is good or
this video is good you're all awake and
feeling good holidays are coming
stocks are up I don't think things could
get any better
well maybe a little less inflation but
we'll get that under control too
so shall we talk about the news
um it doesn't look like uh I'll be doing
that because
I hope all my notes printed sorry I have
to check it looks like my printer ran
out of paper hold on
never strap yourself to a microphone and
then try to
go across
all right I gotta check one thing make
sure my node Sprints down
nope they did not hold on
I know this makes it more exciting
yeah I did the Sip
you you missed the Sip
yeah it is tough with two screens the
the uh the two iPads I turned one upside
down so that the two cameras are roughly
in the same place
and now
ladies and gentlemen
long lasting
I'm gonna add this to my checklist
check printer for paper
all right where was I
um I'd like to start with the funniest
thing I've said in a while
you know that Don Lemon has been brought
into the shutout printer shut up
like my printer just decides that it
suddenly needs to make noise and little
things
Don Lemon is part of the Jesse smallet
story maybe we'll get a verdict on that
today by the way but I thought that Don
Lemon and Jesse smaller should start a
podcast together
hmm what would we call it
I would call it
smell it and smell it
smell it and smell it
okay
all right if you haven't read the news
that doesn't mean anything to you I made
some money today and yesterday by
betting against the fake news which is
my new uh my new technique don't do what
I do this is gambling but
so far betting against fake news has
worked
so when the Omicron virus came out and
it looked like oh no it's another
variant I bet against it and I said to
myself you know the fake news likes to
get us all worked up over nothing
so I'm gonna bet it's nothing
now sometimes it is something and then
you lose all your money if you use this
technique but I bet the the Omicron
would be and I bought a stock
in wooden hotels
which are up eight and a half percent
since yesterday morning basically
so that's a free money by betting that
the news is fake
now here's the trick
normally if everybody has the same
information you can't make money
I don't know if you know that but it's
sort of a basic economic Financial fact
if everybody had the same information
probably everybody would make similar
decisions and then you wouldn't get any
good opportunities because everything
would be bit up to its right price but
because the fake news has created this
interesting situation where the big
investors sort of have to follow the
actual news don't they
say you're a giant hedge fund or you're
managing money for other people
and the news says the Omicron virus
looks like it's terrible
what do you have to do
you sort of kind of have to pair back
your position a little bit don't you
because if you're a big industrial
investor
you kind of have to follow the headlines
don't you because if the headlines turn
down to be true
and you invested in the opposite
direction
you'd look terrible but I'm not bound by
that because I'm not investing anybody
else's money
so this is your financial uh little
lesson of the day
I have special information
really I don't have information that's
special it's just I can act on it so I
can just say well the headlines look
fake to me and just bet against it but a
big fund manager can't do that so I have
I have temporarily probably a little
Advantage now I should say that you
should diversify no matter what you're
doing so if you're putting a bunch of
money in one company it doesn't matter
what your reason is it's a dumb idea
right you should have multiple
Investments or don't do it at all
right that's your financial advice of
the day
you should follow on Twitter the
following account Saul of United Saul
spelled s-a-u-l
a uh just Google that or just search it
on Twitter and he has lots of good Tech
fines I'm going to read you a couple of
them so here's some good news from
technology world
so it is an Israeli alternative meat
developer
called uh meet Tech
they they can
they can print a stake now
that's right
they can use a a 3D printer
to print a stake and they make the parts
of the steak and have a scaled
production of cultivated bioprinted
steak
and so it looks I don't know if it has
the same texture but
sort of looks stakish
everybody's saying no thanks no thanks I
want to eat my real real animals that
make them suffer
well that's what a man does
but anyway
um I don't know if I would ever partake
in such a thing but I would like to
point out that
the Star Trek replicator
is here
this is the Star Trek Star Trek
replicator
you know on Star Trek they would if they
wanted to eat they'd go over to the
replicator and say give me a hamburger
and it would just like make it out of
whatever
but now we can actually 3D print your
dinner now we're starting with a steak
but how hard would it be to to print
mashed potatoes
earlier right I mean easier it'd be
easier to make mashed potatoes so I
think the other stuff will be easier
than meat
uh so that's interesting I don't know if
it's good news or bad but it's
interesting it might solve climate
change if we're printing steak instead
of
slaughtering cows
over on CNN Senator toon
t-h-u-n-e is that the is it thune or
tune
t-h-u-n-e soon or tune somebody somebody
will tell me
his third oh is it it's actually third
ah interesting okay
uh that's probably a good idea for his
family because otherwise they'd be
Looney Tunes you know they would but you
can't see Looney Tunes that doesn't make
any sense
so he's introducing a bill that would
require big Tech
um the platforms
to turn off their algorithms if you flip
the switch to do so so you'd have to
choose to do it but instead of being
manipulated by the big Tech algorithms
which feed you what they want to feed
you in terms of information you could
just turn it off and then it would just
be streaming by and uh probably
um
timing order the ordinary came in
what do you think of that a good idea or
a bad idea in the comments
good idea or bad idea
um yeah this one this one is not from
Saul of United I'll get to another one
of those in a minute
and I don't know how hard it would be it
doesn't feel like it would be the
hardest thing in the world to program in
fact it might be the easiest thing just
just put in some code the skips your
algorithm right
um of course I'm overstating how easy
that would be it would actually be
tremendously difficult
but if you're not the one who has to
program it it looks easy to you if
there's anything the Dilbert comic has
taught you is if your boss thinks it
looks easy
you're not going to have much time to do
it
all right well I think that's a good
idea and I would compliment CNN for
running it on their website and for the
senator for raising it
at the very least it's worth trying
you know we're sort of in a world where
a b testing just makes sense we don't
really know how things work you know we
don't know it'll work out right but it's
a really good idea it's definitely worth
testing so good for you senator thune
have I told you how wonderful my e-bike
is my electric bike yes I have in fact
I've told you so many times you're
freaking sick of it
but it turns out that the the build back
better plan includes a 900 tax credit
for purchasing an e-bike
what do you think of that
a 900 tax credit for purchasing an
e-bike
now this would have two purposes
number one for a lot of people who can't
afford a car
the e-bike will allow you to go you know
great distances without much trouble so
you could ride your e-bike I don't know
10 or 15 miles to work without without
uh having a sweat
so
um the first time I rode an e-bike as I
told you I knew this was the future
you have to try it at least once
if you think to yourself oh I like
regular bikes and I like the exercise
well that's all good
but try it it's not about the exercise
you will feel something on a new bike
right it's sort of the same feeling I
had when the first time I saw the
internet before any of you had even
heard the word internet
I was I was playing with it in the at
the phone company because we had it we
had it early
and I saw people's reaction to this
thing called the internet they couldn't
do anything
and people were all excited about it and
I thought well this looks like the
future sure enough
well the first time you touch an e-bike
just driving around the parking lot
you'll you'll never go back
everything's going to move this way
not everything but but there's going to
be a tremendous tremendous industry
around electric vehicles some of them
fully fully electric some with a little
pedaling Etc
so I'm not sure I agree or disagree with
the tax credit I'll let the economist
work that out but it is an indication
that e-bikes are the thing and trust me
on that all right
also Saul of United found this little
tidbit that over in Kyoto a team of uh
scientists in Japan have figured out how
to make a face mask that will glow under
Aid I guess under a dark light
um
when exposed to ultra oh ultraviolet
light so you got to put it under
ultraviolet light and you can see if you
are infected with the virus whoa
your face mask
will tell you if you're infected you
have to put the light on it so people
won't see it if you're just walking
around
but whoa
isn't that pretty cool now here's the
bad news it won't be available until
maybe next year even if everything goes
well they've proven that it works so the
question of whether it works that's
settled
it works
in fact it works so well and here's the
funny part
the head researcher discovered that he
had coveted by just putting on his own
mask
and then he he confirmed it with a test
so
um I hope we're not wearing masks a year
from now but at least probably medical
people probably will so this is pretty
big
pretty pretty big especially if you had
like a spouse who was infected
it would be one more way to get an early
warning and imagine if you could get the
early warnings and get your
Therapeutics what about that
what if you can get your Therapeutics
earlier because you had this early
warning it's all good news
well the funniest and weirdest story is
that Fox News lit a Christmas tree
outside the Fox News building
and then somebody decided to set it on
fire
and the entire tree just like caught on
fire and became this gigantic burning
thing
of course there might be some jokes that
surround this event
um
I'd like to start off with
man when Fox News lights a tree they
really light a tree
that's just my warm-up joke all right
that one that that's just a warm-up you
don't have to laugh at that one
um number two well looks like the war on
Christmas is real
okay that's still just a warm-up that is
just a warm-up
okay uh on on the other side of the
aisle the Democrats are saying it's a a
sign a sign that a Satan finally uh
accepted that fox news's deal
now you don't have to take sides to know
that that's funny that's the other side
that Fox News accepted Satan's deal
all right
uh here's my own contribution to the
birding Christmas tree humor and it goes
like this
I don't know who lit the Fox News
Christmas tree on fire but the two white
guys who attacked Jesse smallit are
still out there somewhere
better
was that better I told you the first
ones were just warm-ups
got to the good stuff
all right
um is math racist
so here's a story to get everybody
wagging their tongues is math racist so
apparently there is a movement various
places around the country to make math
more what they call inclusive
because the math is all racist
now I remember when I heard that the
SATs were racist you remember that a
while back somebody said the SAT
questions are racist what was your first
reaction to that
no it isn't right when you heard that
the SATs were racist you said to
yourself I don't think so
I mean I took the SATs and see any
racism in there
but
I heard an example
here's an example given this was way
back this is not at the moment but way
back somebody gave an actual example of
an SAT question that when I saw it I
said
oh yeah that is kind of racist do you
think that exists
do you think I can give you an actual
s.a.t question that you yourself will
say oh yeah that is kind of racist do
you think I can do that
challenge
me
challenge accepted
damn it don't get ahead of me mystic not
work
that is exactly where I'm going yeah one
of the questions was uh to fill in the
second part of a sentence cup and
cup and
and one of the choices was saucer
and one of the one of the choices was
table
if you're poor
what the is a saucer
right if you're a poor person who the
hell ever saw a saucer what's that a
flying saucer what the hell is a saucer
and now certainly poor white people
might not know what a saucer is too but
that's actually a pretty good example I
mean certainly biases against you know
low-income people and that would be
heavily you know minority populated so
it's actually a pretty good example so I
don't know what the examples are of math
being racist in this context I didn't
see any examples so I'm going to be
open-minded about whether there is an
example or is not uh because they didn't
they didn't give me enough in the
stories and it was beyond the paywall
and blah blah but
if the if you wanted to destroy a great
nation
well what would be a good way to do it
you wanted to destroy a country well
military militarily but we have a big
military so good luck with that
the best way to do it would be to take
the smartest people and make them stay
in the class with the dumb people
that would be the best way to destroy
the whole country
because as I've often said it doesn't
really matter if our average math scores
don't compare favorably to the average
math scores of China or anybody else do
you know why
why doesn't it matter that our average
math scores are as good as the average
math scores in other countries
because almost nobody uses math
at least the higher level math that that
would matter
it's the top two percent they go on to
you know stem jobs and engineering and
inventing stuff so
math is about
teaching the bottom 98 percent had a
balance their checkbook
and then and the top two percent were
developing them to you know move the for
the country forward invent stuff
engineer Things become Math teachers I
suppose
but it's only about the top few percent
that's what math is about the rest of us
we just need to be able to you know do
the basics to get by
so what would happen if you take our two
percent and make them sit in the same
class with everybody else well if they
have any money
they're going to get the hell out of
there right away and they're going to go
home school right away
and they're going to get tutors
in my town
the tutoring business is gigantic is it
is it big in your where you live
is is the tutoring business big where
you are because I think that's sort of a
high income luxury
yeah it's big here
um yeah so so kids here are asking for
it actually around here kids would say
can I have a tutor you know to get a
little extra advantage to go to college
and stuff
yeah it's a big deal over here so uh if
this continues this trend where they put
the smartest in the same class with
everybody else they're just gonna have
to get out of there you know you you
don't want your top one percenters in
the class with everybody else that's
just not helping anybody
all right uh Putin and uh Biden had a
effectively a zoom call Summit of course
they don't use zoom but uh they talked
on video
and here's what came out of that I guess
Biden warned
Putin that if he if he were to invade
any further into the Ukraine that Biden
said there would be uh hard financial
sanctions and NATO would reposition
so that's Biden's thing Financial
sanctions and NATO would reposition
what exactly do we have left for
financial sanctions are you telling me
there's a whole bunch of financial
sanctions out there that we could use
that we're not
what exactly is left
there's something missing in the story
what the hell are we going to actually
do
you know somebody says Swift
transactions or Banking and stuff but
here's the thing
if you cut Russia off from let's say the
international banking system
I don't know that that feels pretty
provocative isn't it
I think I feel like the financial stuff
we don't have a lot of wiggle room
without going full War
so we'll see what happens there but
here's the most interesting part
um
Vladimir Putin is calling for both sides
to launch new talks to Defuse The
Situation
Putin
is asking for talks
to defuse Ukraine
how does that make sense if he wants to
attack
does does that make sense
do you think that the asking for more
talks to Defuse The Situation
do you think that's a a clever military
ploy to get us to stand down and then
he'll jump in and attack
I don't think so
so uh we can't know right you don't know
and I don't know because it's hard to
predict but here's what I get out of
this this is the hypnotist in me talking
the last thing in the world Vladimir
Putin wants to do is invade Ukraine
I feel like that's what he just told us
because you don't ask for talks to
diffuse something that you want to do do
you you know even as a trick
you don't do that because you know what
would happen
if if by if Putin
said hey let's have talks to defuse it
and then attack while we're having talks
or at least they're still ongoing
that's the end
that that's a line
I mean that's a real real real real real
line all right it's one thing to attack
when nobody expects it that's bad enough
but if you attack while you're having
talks
during the talks using the talks as a
decoy
no you don't come back from that
am I the only one who thinks that
I don't think you come back from that I
think you have to end Russia at that
point probably financially but but you
have to just end them at that point you
can't deal with them at all again you
could never ever have another
conversation with with Russia you'd have
you just remove the diplomats and Crush
their economy and be done with it you
know there'd be some risk but you just
have to do it at that point
so here's what I think Putin's not an
idiot
he's not a nice guy
but he's not dumb
he's obviously using Ukraine for
negotiating
how many would agree that he's signaling
that the Ukraine move is purely to
negotiate for something else probably to
negotiate to keep them from joining NATO
is that a reasonable request
is it reasonable for Russia to say you
know we've got this line and the line is
you don't put NATO on our border
it's a pretty reasonable request
if Russia puts some missiles into Cuba
what would we do you know what we'd do
right you know what we do if they put
Russia if they put missiles in Cuba
because it already happened right
so here we are putting maybe NATO into
Ukraine what the hell would we expect
Putin to do
we'd expect them to push pretty damn
hard back
so it feels to me like this is a
negotiating thing probably Putin wants
to keep his you know pipelines and keep
his negotiating situation but I'm going
to go
to a place that no one has gone before
except me
it's time to talk about being allies
it's time to talk about being allies
with Russia because we have to
not because we want to but because space
the space the war in space has already
started
do you want to be one of uh three
superpowers maybe four maybe India will
get up there pretty soon
or do you want to have Russia on your
side
if there's one thing I can tell you for
sure
if I get in a fight
I want Russia on my side
anybody would anybody disagree with that
if you're in a fight
you won't Rush on your team
right now you could say that's against
China or not now of course Russia has a
you know pretty delicate thing because
they've got all kinds of Russia you know
physical connections and trade and
whatnot
so
do you hear yourself
Scott's still ignoring the troop build
up
well I didn't mention it but that's not
ignoring it I thought everybody knew
about the true build up everybody knows
that Putin has a troop built up on the
border right of Ukraine
so my take is that that's part of the
negotiating if he had not asked for a
new round of talks then I would have
taken this seriously that it's a an
invasion
but I think that it's uh and he may
actually have it might actually be two
options one is to talk and work it out
and one is to invade so you might have
two options
um but I think he prefers talking
all right well that's all I'm going to
say about that my prediction is no
invasion of Ukraine and we should move
toward becoming allies with Russia
militarily at least
and we just don't have a reason for
attacking each other
all right uh unless it's our oil
companies that are telling us that we
need Russia not to compete with our our
energy industry I worry about that
all right uh Rasmussen poll asked how
people think Biden is handling the
pandemic
and what do we find out we found that 56
percent disapprove of how Biden is
handling the pandemic and 56 also either
mildly or very much uh uh say that he
broke his promise and the pandemic
do you think those numbers would be
different if we had a different
president
I don't really
I feel like
I feel like Trump would have had the
same numbers because there's just so
much you can do about the
the pandemic you know there's definitely
a limit to what you can do so I would
say that uh
um that sounds about right I mean we're
all just unhappy with the pandemic so
the leader gets the the blame no matter
what
all right here's the weirdest thing
that's happening right now but maybe
it's not weird that one of the most
frequent comments I get on social media
which has something to do with the
number the type of people who follow me
I guess is that the pandemic isn't real
and if we just ignored it that would be
our best strategy
and I asked how many people believe that
and of course this is you know highly
unscientific it's just the people who
follow me Etc but 47 percent
of the people who answered
said that the number of dead people uh
dying and uh and the virus itself is uh
fake basically and that or or fakish
meaning that it's overblown right so
these are not people who are saying
there is no such thing as a coronavirus
but they're just saying that the whole
thing is so overblown that if you just
ignored it
you'd be fine
47 percent
now here's my take on that
if this had been five years ago
I would have said this is a bunch of
 idiots
five years ago
five years ago I would have said this is
wow wow these are some really thick
people
freaking stupid idiots wow
five years ago
do you know what I say today
today I say oh it looks like pattern
recognition
it looks like pattern recognition
if the fake news had not brought
us one hoax after another
I would say geez you're really
untrusting
just just look around you
you know all the news all the countries
are handling it
but once you've seen what the fake news
can do to the public
not trusting it anymore is no longer
irrational
if if all you did was disagree with the
government every single time they say
that anything
your your prediction rate would be not
bad I mean it wouldn't be a hundred
percent
but it'd probably be better than 50
percent
yeah you'd probably be clocking in at
like 55 correct just saying everything
the government tells you is wrong
am I wrong you would be more correct
just saying everything they say is a lie
even though you know it's not 100
percent
but I'll bet you'd get more than 50
percent in our current world
but it'd be more than 55 percent too
so
um I'm gonna say I fully respect this
opinion
I disagree with it
I disagree with it
you know my reading of the world is that
the pandemic's completely real
not the way we're handling it is
excellent you know I would get rid of
mandates Etc I think it's time to do
that but I think it's real I think the
bodies are real I think even if we over
counted or under counted that there's
some you know tremendous number of
people dying
so I think it's real but
the the opinion that says it's not real
or at least we should treat it like it's
not real because it's a better strategy
I actually respect that opinion
surprisingly
I know that it surprises you right I
fully respect that opinion because the
fake news has created this situation
it's not our fault
it's not isn't it's not my fault that
the news on every other topic is fake
so if you don't believe this topic
as pattern recognition it's just pattern
recognition doesn't mean you're right
but it means there's a pattern
um yeah I think to people saying it's
fake really just mean it's over hyped
and we should just you know go back to
our regular life now why is it we don't
trust the news well let me give you an
example from today's headlines
why is it we don't trust the news
let me just read this to you
I don't even have to add the comment
this is just the news okay
preliminary this was on CNN I think
preliminary lab studies showed two doses
of the Pfizer vaccine may not provide
sufficient protection against the
Omicron virus variant but here's the
good news
three doses are able to neutralize it
yeah the two doses they're not gonna
they're not gonna really do anything for
the Omicron but according to Pfizer
according to Pfizer if you get that
third booster well your Omicron will be
beaten
do you know what uh
Vladimir Putin calls the Omicron virus
possibly a vaccine
that's right Putin said oh macrod is
overblown it might be closer to a
vaccine
meanwhile Pfizer is going to charge you
extra
make a few hundred billion dollars extra
by selling you that booster that's going
to take care of the Omicron which we
don't need to take care of
so if you pay extra
you can get rid of the only thing that
would stop the pandemic which is the
Omicron spreading enough so that we get
a natural immunity without getting
really sick
now let me ask you again
why is it that the citizens don't trust
the news
this is why
was there anybody here who didn't know
that Pfizer would find a way to create a
booster or at least tell you the booster
they have is going to take care of that
new variant but you need the booster
um
Two Shots that's not going to get it
done you're gonna need that booster let
me ask you another question
do you think that Pfizer will someday
suggest an additional booster
for the fourth shot
the up you QJ Scott's awake
Scott's awake Scott's awake
idiots you're gone
all right
uh more on fake news and this one's
really interesting you're gonna think
this is about vaccinations but it's
about
um news Bubbles and information bubbles
this one is really really interesting
and only the psychology of it and the
fake news of it not about the actual
virus itself
so here's a question that uh Kyle Becker
who is also somebody you should follow
if you don't file follow Kyle you're
missing some good stuff he has lots of
good scoops
so Kyle Becker if you just uh search of
him on Twitter you'll find him
um
so I think he used to be associated with
Fox News but he's doing his own thing
now and a lot of his a lot of his
content I see a lot of stuff for the
first time from him
and he and I disagree on the following
question
now here's why
this is so interesting
Kyle Becker is really well informed I've
been following from for a while I would
say of people who follow the news and
are really paying attention he'd be in
the top
two percent
at least five percent right I would say
I'm probably in the top five percent of
people who follow the news
does that seem fair that that's people
who do this for a living we're probably
the top five percent of just paying
attention right
so he and I have both been paying
attention and came to completely
opposite opinions
on what the news was telling us
this is really interesting to me and I
don't know the answer normally I'd be
telling you that he's wrong
right obviously
but I can't tell all I know is that he
and I are looking at the same stuff
and we're saying completely different
things and I don't know why
here's here's the topic
do vaccinated people spread the virus
the same as unvaccinated
everything I've seen says that
vaccinations
vastly reduce the spread
everything I've seen
everything that Kyle has seen
says the opposite
what's up with that now I know he's a
legitimate guy right
so if if you're thinking oh Kyle's you
know messed up or something no no he's a
smart guy
who is following the news every bit as
much as I am and maybe more
probably more because he you know this
is more of a a career for him than it is
for me
um
but in my in my view I have only seen
only with no exceptions
seeing evidence that the vaccinated
people are way less likely to transmit
it and he's seen the opposite
can you explain that
so I went to Google and I Googled it and
I just Googled the question
you know um I forget the exact thing but
you know uh do vaccinated people spread
the virus or something
and when I looked at Google News
every single hit on the front page
agreed with me
every every hit
everyone agreed with me
what was Kyle looking at
so I asked him I said and again this is
this is a polite discussion right
because Kyle's a legitimate guy
like he's smart pays attention how the
hell do we have a different opinion on
the biggest question in the world
it's the biggest question
right so I went over to DuckDuckGo
yeah you're ahead of me
to see if Google
was just doing a fast one on us
because we've seen this over and over
again right you go to DuckDuckGo and
you'll get a whole different search
results about what's a hoax and what's
not
so I go to DuckDuckGo and I do exactly
the same search so I made sure I use the
same search term
and got the same results
they're in a little different order
but DuckDuckGo only has only
has stuff that agrees with me
so what's Kyle seeing and what are you
all seeing because Kyle's opinion agrees
with a whole lot of you I know because I
hear about I hear you all the time what
are you seeing
I'm completely confused so I dug into a
little bit and I have maybe a hypothesis
but I think there are some studies that
would suggest
um that people with vaccinations are
spreading at just as much but
they are low quality studies or
misleading so I guess there was one in
Boston of a bunch of people who went to
public Gatherings and they somehow could
do a retrospective and look and see that
they found that 75 percent of the people
in these
Mass gatherings
75 percent of them who caught the virus
were vaccinated which would agree with
Kyle right 70 foot
Jesus you're Clueless
vet Vegas goodbye
removed
by the way you can tell me what I got
wrong
I'm pretty open to that
but just the personal attacks that just
means you're having the trouble
accepting the fact that that you're
wrong about something
I mean that's really what's going on
like if you're if you're saying Jesus
what's wrong with this guy
it means you're experiencing cognitive
dissonance most of the time
most time all right so this one study
that did show that uh 75 of the people
who got
infected were actually
um vaccinated
but
what percentage of people who went there
were probably vaccinated probably high
do the vaccinated people take more
or less precautions far less
far less far fewer precautions
and so the people who know how to look
at studies say they looked at that study
and they said ah this is not a good
study
so one of the things that agrees with
Kyle has been labeled a poor a poor
study
and then I think there was another one
that Kyle sent about spouses
that there was an identical rate of
transmission among spouses
at least in one study whether when one
was vaccinated and one was not
um versus too vaccinated or all the
other combinations so it looked like
among spouses
that it didn't matter if you were
vaccinated or not your spread was about
the same now do you believe that
here's the problem
that's a mystery on top of a mystery
because we already had a mystery of why
spouses don't catch it
did you know that
that I think somewhere in the
neighborhood of 25 percent of spouses
will catch it from their spouse
how do you not catch coven from your
spouse
I mean what kind of marriage do you have
that you're so you're so socially
distanced from your own spouse you can't
get the catchiest you know the most
spready virus of all time and you can't
give it to your spouse
so here's the problem with that study
it's a mystery on top of a mystery
because apparently whatever is happening
with spouses we fully don't understand
why they don't all give it to each other
like 80 percent of the time
all right so I would say that's that
doesn't really prove the case because
it's a mystery on a mystery it's not a
clean situation
so I would say that Kyle did in fact see
some studies that would suggest that
exactly his view that the vaxxed and
unvaxed spread at different rates but if
you were to Google this
and look what the let's say the
mainstream common most common opinion of
the experts is is not even close
the experts are completely on the same
side
98 99 there's always a rogue
but but would you agree with the
following statement
that in every major country we know of
and all the major
professionals which is not to say
they're right you don't have to agree
that they're correct I'm just saying
what they say
it is true that all the experts
are very clear
that you don't spread it as much if
you're vaccinated and it's not even
close
what do you think
yeah no of course if you disagree with
the experts that's
pretty fair in 2021 I think that's
pretty fair I'm just telling you what
they think
so Kyle's view that there is uh lots of
evidence out there is supported it is
supported he actually came up with some
studies but in my opinion which I would
imagine could be full of confirmation
bias if not cognitive dissonance in my
opinion those studies were lower quality
than the ones that that show there's a
big difference
now I am willing to change that opinion
follow the money good point
follow the money if the money uh would
suggest that we were all being fooled by
these statistics
and it could because the people who make
the vaccinations probably are behind the
data in a lot of cases so
um could we be fooled as a nation yes we
could I don't think so I'd bet against
it but we could be
all right
um
so do you know what's mandatory in a
pandemic we keep talking about all these
mandates
all right the government's going to put
a mandate on us they're going to mandate
masks and they're going to mandate
vaccinations they're going to mandate
all kinds of stuff
well
let me let me suggest this standard
for mandates
before you even talk about whether to
put one on or not
prior to even having the discussion of
mandates
the ticket to get into the discussion
forget about the decision
the ticket even to have a conversation
about putting
mandates on the public let me tell you
what mandate I want
I need to know what kind of financial
ties our decision makers have to Big
Pharma not just the financial not not
just the medical experts
but the decision makers I want to know
the FDA the you know every every health
professional in the government and out I
want to know what their connection is
to the Pharma companies that have a role
in any of this stuff
and here's my mandate
don't ask me to do anything
until you show me that
right that's my mandate don't
ask the public to do any thing
nothing no thing until you show
us that
you do that and we'll have a
conversation about mandates
we might not want them we may reject
them for good reasons but we're not
going to have a conversation
about it until you fix this we need to
know who is making money off of this
 or get out of our lives
 you with your mandates if
you can't tell us this information you
know we need to know this everybody
knows we need to know this everybody
knows this everybody knows it's the most
important thing we need to know
you all know it
they're not going to give it to you so
 you and your mandates until until
we have this information
that's my take so a lot of you are like
Scott why are you so pro-mandates
you your misinformation the
mandates everybody in the
government until you tell us this
that's it
that's that's my stake
well back to fun
um
Matt Gates has told at least one person
Alexander nazarian is reporting on
Twitter the Matt Gates told them
personally that if the Republicans take
the house in 2022 the gates will propose
making Trump
Speaker of the House
which apparently is completely
constitutionally appropriate he doesn't
have to be an elected official
now
this is actually a thing that can be
done you just have to have the
Republicans agree
that's it the entire standard
the only bar you'd have to to exceed
is that the Republicans would say yeah
let's do that that's it
and he would be Speaker of the House
now could he run for president while
he's Speaker of the House
probably
I mean usually when people are running
for office they'll you know they take
some time off in effect from their day
job but Trump wouldn't have to Trump
could run for president just by being
Speaker of the House
because he'd be on TV all the time does
he need to do a rally well they're
helpful probably can still do some but
he wouldn't need to you just have to be
Speaker of the House
and uh I don't think that's going to
happen because it's yeah just too
provocative I think the the system would
fall apart but uh
uh fun to watch well here's a disturbing
story from my backyard uh so this is you
know driving distance from where I live
in California
so there were uh two there was a black
couple Paula and Tanisha
and they were
getting a estimate of their house so
they had their house appraised they were
I guess they were thinking of selling it
and the appraisal came back way less
than they expected because they put four
hundred thousand dollars worth of
upgrades in it
um but it didn't it didn't appraise for
much more
so they were thinking that there were
victims of racism
because how could you put four hundred
thousand dollars worth of upgrades into
a house and yet the house is only worth
a little bit more
how's that possible
do you know how that's possible
because that's the way it always happens
for everybody
if you put four hundred thousand dollars
of upgrades into your house
you'll be happy living there but it
doesn't decrease the value of your house
do you know who knows that
everybody who ever bought a house
all right look at the comments the the
people who know this are exactly your
house
is going to be priced based on the
comparables
and and your neighbor didn't put in any
upgrades
that's it if your neighbor didn't
upgrade and he sold this house for x
amount and yours is the same square
footage and you're on the same block
that's your value
so the first part of the story is
absolute fake news
there is no reason to suspect
that the value of the home would go up
because of their upgrades you all know
that right well I mean now you know it
it's a well-known you know universally
understood principle you've read lots of
articles about it if you've ever put an
upgrade into your home as I have and
then sold it
do you know how much the upgrade got you
nothing do you know how many homes I
have personally upgraded substantially
and then sold
three so far
and they sold for about what they would
have sold if I had done no upgrades
always maybe 10 more but that's about it
all right so the first part of the story
is utter absolute complete
but
the second part of the story is really
alarming
what they did was they got a white
friend a woman to pretend that she was
the the wife uh and she was the only one
there so they removed all the pictures
that would you know have any kind of a
African art or pictures of the couple
and they put in you know white white
family pictures and made it look like
the whitest home and then another
appraiser came in and appraised it for a
half a billion dollars more
what
what
half a million dollars more
just because the house looked white a
week later
what
now if this were a repeatable thing
uh uh this is about as bad as anything
could be bad right you don't have to
worry about you know is there such a
thing as you know racism or you know
whatever kind of racism you want to call
this yes if this is true
and it's part of the pattern it's like
the worst thing I've ever seen
but
do you ever have a case where two
appraisers come up with different
numbers
does that ever happened
suppose those uh those upgrades weren't
permitted
do you know if the upgrades were
permitted
because sometimes you might have to rip
them out
do you know if the upgrades were done
well were they done by professionals or
were they done by maybe themselves
so I would ask this question before I
get excited about this
um how how common is it to have two
appraisals that are way different
how different how common is it to have
appraisals that are way different
well
there's a reason that sometimes you get
two of them
the reason is that sometimes they're
wrong right do people ever get two
appraisals because they don't like the
first one
yes yes very common
so does this one anecdotal uh situation
tell you that there is massive racism in
the real estate market
nope
nope it does not tell you that but the
news is selling it to you like like it
does like this is a solid proof
but nope
nope that's not here this information
does not give us any information about
this now
let me give you some additional context
I believe that this experiment has been
tried multiple times
and my understanding I don't have a
source for it but my understanding is
that this has been demonstrated to be a
real thing and that it's sort of
everywhere and you could reproduce it at
will pick a place just do the same
experiment you get similarly shocking
I mean just shocking results
now
I don't know if any of those studies
were
valid because we're in a world where we
don't trust anything especially studies
but I would only caution you that you
can't make anything from this one
anecdote except the one thing you can
get from anecdotes which is it raises a
gigantic flag
I mean I'd want to know if this is real
not just this example but I'd want to
know
is this happening still in 2021-22 are
we really
really this racist
I'd hate to think so but all evidence
suggests we probably are
all right
so that again is another example of me
not having a binary opinion so half the
people will think I was just a racist
and half of the people will say I was
very reasonable
hello from Nigeria
Stefan
um racism is usually just pattern
recognition
um
correct because your brains are pattern
pattern recognition machines you can't
turn that off
so being racist is not sort of an option
you either your brain has pattern
recognition or you're dead
and our pattern recognition is not good
so what do we have pattern recognition
that doesn't mean we're accurate about
it just means it's happening
uh
but they identify wrong patterns that is
correct so part of the problem with
racism is that we see incorrect patterns
but we're sure they're real
is there a difference between racism and
affinitism yes yes there is
all right
um
I think that's all I have for today
do they miss anything
there's never been a better show I think
you're completely correct the best show
that there's ever been in all of history
in the world
boo is doing great and she's taking her
medicines by mouth so I might be able to
get that feeding tube out now
um
Epstein you know the Epstein thing isn't
interesting me weirdly they're going to
have to throw in some new accusations
about famous people to get me interested
again if it's just more
creepy Epstein stuff coming out and this
is more of it
um
I'm going to tell my grandchildren about
this episode one day
say hey to Christina I will
um
do you think we'd get even more drastic
differences as the pictures in the home
showed a short guy and then they swapped
him for a hot woman well I wondered
about that who who was the white woman
that the black couple asked to pretend
it was her and was she unusually
attractive
that's a fair question you don't think
that attractive people get higher
evaluations for their homes
have you ever tried eating with an
attractive person
makes the food taste better
I hate to say it can anybody confirm
that if you have a meal with a highly
attractive person
it makes the food taste better
shouldn't but it does
yeah look at all the yeses going by
right so if you're appraising a house
and you walk in and you see a beautiful
person there male or female they're just
beautiful
do they get a higher appraisal
probably
now to be fair
the black couple that it was pictured in
the story were an attractive couple
so it wouldn't be attractiveness I don't
think in this case but it's a good
question
right the the black couple was quite
attractive so I don't think that was the
problem exactly
um
you can't have your view vaccines reduce
spread and believe that we should have
more infection and death now
yeah you can
those are not incompatible
those are very compatible Concepts
um it's just math I mean I won't run
through it but yeah the math is that you
can have those two things
well that's a
it's a dark comment there
all right uh
thought you were removing all family
pictures when you staged a home oh good
point all right good point on YouTube
uh somebody in YouTube says isn't it
typical to remove all your family
pictures when you're putting it up for
sale
uh yes
but not when you're getting it appraised
am I right
somebody in real estate might have to
answer this for me I think if you're
showing it to people you get rid of the
family pictures
because so that they can imagine
themselves living there more easily but
for appraisals I don't think you remove
that stuff for appraisals
I'm seeing some yeses
you would approve I mean if if the
timing was right I guess you would
prefer it I don't think you necessarily
need to do it
because imagine suppose they were just
getting a refinance
yeah they might have been just getting a
refinance
what percent do you think the vaccine
reduces transmission and for uh what one
month
um well we know the trans the vaccines
wear off if you don't get the booster
um the experts are saying it's a five
times less likely or five times more
likely to spread it if you're
unvaccinated that's what the experts say
my own opinion isn't useful because what
would that be
yeah I haven't been talking too much
about defund the police and the wave of
crime except I'm a little uh concerned
that the crime wave doesn't exist
um
Gutfeld said he took down anything with
Fox News on it yeah you would certainly
have to do that
all right
um
where's the supply chain I it looks like
the supply chain worked itself out by
the way some of you knew that uh I was
trying to buy a Ford vehicle
for a family member and
um I couldn't get it and I couldn't even
tell them I couldn't even get them to
tell me if it was ordered or when it
would come
but I tweeted about it and it turns out
if you have enough followers and you
tweet about a service problem you get a
lot of action so I think all of Northern
California Ford is working on my problem
right now
this might be them right now
um
so I have heard from a number of
Executives at Ford that they're working
on it and my specific car is has a
commodity problem meaning that there's
at least one part that they can't get so
they can't they can't do the build of
the car because they can't get a part I
don't know what part it is probably
chips
probably chips yeah it's a Mustang
um
probably chips now by the way and let me
let me say this I want to say this as
clearly as possible
Ford's a great company it's a great
American company and I I I'm a big fan
of their products I love their design
especially for the for the price level
of their products they have the best
design at that price level for
everything I think and
um and they also were very responsive at
a corporate level you know as soon as
they heard of my complaint and they're
and they're all over it trying to figure
out what's going on my only complaint
was communication
I didn't have a complaint that I had to
wait
did not have a complaint about that
because it's a it's a problem everywhere
right
and uh
it almost sounded like maybe they were
treating me special because of the
prominence of my complaint and I
actually asked them not to I said you
know I'm not asking for special
treatment I I really don't want to go to
the front of the line because it's not
like
you know it's not like something basic
necessity that I'm lacking or something
is literally a luxury expense and if
other people need their I don't know
Ford truck to go to work or something
I'd much rather wait at the end of the
line so I don't need it I just wanted to
know I just wanted to know what the
situation was and now they've told me so
I'm all happy
if I've ever told you this standard I
don't know if I have but I would like to
share it with you as my closing thought
today
people make mistakes
if that makes you mad you're going to
have a terrible life your life is just
going to be trash if you're mad about
people's mistakes because we all make
them and sometimes it's not intentional
it just happens but you can definitely
judge people by how they respond to
their mistakes
I don't judge people by mistakes
ever because everybody makes them but
you can totally judge them by how they
responded and Ford responded
aggressively well
so
a plus
right the any any errors or omissions
are completely forgiven that's just my
philosophy
now I realize it it departs from reality
a little bit because sometimes mistakes
actually have to be condemned but as a
philosophy for staying sane and being
you know as good a person as I can in a
bad world
I just try to judge people by how they
handle the mistakes that's it that's the
only standard for other people
everything else
it's not for me to judge them
all right that's all for now and I will
say bye to YouTube and I'll talk a
little bit more to uh
my friends here on locals talk to you
tomorrow
