good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams it's the
highlight of civilization
um you might notice my voice is a little
raspy got a little laryngitis so turn up
your sound put on your headphones this
is as loud as I can get
now if you'd like to take your
experience up to levels that I don't
know are just impossible to imagine at
this point all you have to do is grab
yourself a cup or a mug or a glass a
tanker jealous of style and a canteen
Joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine the other day
the thing that makes everything better
and today it comes with a little
oxytocin too it's called the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
well jacinta
I hope you enjoyed your very first
simultaneous sip
everybody
congratulations to jacinta
good
I hope I'm pronouncing that right I may
I turned the the J into a y is that
correct
j-a-c-i-n-t-a yasanta
sounds about right
all right well
how many of you have seen the famous
probably every one of you the famous uh
audio
illusion in which you could hear uh what
is it green needle or something else
so you could hear two different things
even though it's always the same
well have you seen the one where there's
a whole list of things you can see
this is the one that will completely
change your opinion about the world
now I don't know if you can hear it hold
on
all right so before I put on the audio
just see that there's a whole list of
different things which the same audio
will sound like
but only if you're looking at it at the
time
so in other words if you're looking at
the line that says baptism piracy you
hear exactly that on the audio as soon
as you move to any other thing on the
list and there are two four six eight
there are eight things here
eight completely different sets of words
completely different you can hear each
of them clearly by reading it at the
same time as the music now I don't think
it'll come through very well on my audio
but you'll at least get the sense that
this is the most mind-bending thing
you'll ever see in your life right so
here's the sound
[Applause]
I just realized this doesn't work at all
because you can't read the you can't
read the sentences but you can you can
hear this as Bart Simpson bouncing
rotating pirate ship that isn't my
receipt lobsters in motion that is
embarrassing lactates and Pharmacy
baptism piracy or that isn't Mercy
no sound yeah there's plenty of sound
so the people saying there's no sound or
just trolls
um
now here's why this is so mind-blowing
when when the audio illusion was two
different things
you could tell yourself oh well that's a
weird coincidence there are two
different things the in the right
conditions you would confuse with each
other
in a way it's not really that
interesting is it
right it's not really interesting so
but what happens when there's eight
entirely different
words that you could hear clearly by
looking at them when the when the same
sound is playing
how do you explain that
the only way to explain that
is that reality is super subjective now
you knew reality was subjective because
we all have different opinions looking
at the same stuff but I'll bet you
didn't know it was that subjective
I mean that is really subjective and
that might be that might be the way you
walk around through life all the time
you know I think it was in the 60s the
first time I heard you hear what you
want to hear
you see what you want to see and the
first time I heard that it was sort of
mind-blowing really
do you hear what you want to hear
hmm I'm not so sure because you know I
was a kid I was like I don't know that
sounds a little simplistic doesn't it
but you do you actually hear what you
want to hear you can see this with news
stories
how many times have you seen on social
media somebody would tweet a story and
say look this proves X and I look at it
I go no it doesn't it disproves X
literally literally the opposite
so that that's the reality that you walk
around in there is no fixed reality or
if there is we can't tell what it is
um I would like to give one
clarification an important one
when Elon Musk and other prominent
people said we should pause rates I said
that's a good idea
other people said wait wait China and
other countries will Blaze ahead of us
if we slow down and that would be
dangerous
to which I say I'm not in favor of of
stopping development
so I'm only in favor of not making it
available to the General Public
too soon
so that's the only pause I would favor I
don't favor
stopping research I don't favor stopping
training it yet the I do believe that we
have a competitive
National Security and financial interest
and being first and being best and we're
lucky that we have a company that seems
to be first and best at least at the
moment
so I wouldn't want to lose that asset
it's one of the things that makes
America as strong as it is that we have
entrepreneurs who can create
technologies that change the world it
looks like that's what's happening
but I do think it would be wise to keep
it out of the hands of citizens for a
little while or even other commercial
interests and let the AI people do what
they're doing and then we can decide
what to do with it
um
but here's a take on this that is sort
of a clarification of something I've
said before the real risk of AI is that
if it starts telling us uh stuff that
isn't true
it will be banned or ignored would you
agree
if you couldn't trust AI to tell you
what's true which is the current
situation it's it's not reliable
it I found that my need to use it was
much lower once I realized that it was
full of does anybody have that
experience
when it first came out I thought oh my
God
I'm so interested in what it says
but as soon as I knew that it lies or
just randomly makes up facts I thought
oh it's just a random it's just a random
word generator I have no interest in a
random word generator
a random word generator that looks
intelligent to people who don't look
into it too carefully is not interesting
in the in the least
but will it always be like that
so there are two conditions one if AI is
undependable
it won't be that useful and people won't
be caring about it
but what if it becomes accurate
and how would we know
it's almost as dangerous if it's
accurate
because if it's accurate then there will
be no common narrative for the country
here's the problem
in the in my youth in let's say 40s and
50s or 60s we know now that the CIA
was actively
manipulating movies and TV
and trying to create a culture
that would be successful and defensible
and they succeeded the the so-called you
know American dream of you know owning a
house and being a consumer and having a
nice car and being a Christian back in
those days that was key thing those
things were never natural
those things were programs
so the United States wisely and
effectively programmed its citizens
how many of you stood and did the Pledge
of Allegiance
you know that's just brainwashing right
it's good brainwashing it's the kind I
approve of because you can't really let
Society take its own you know wild
Direction any way it goes it's just
chaos
so there probably is some need to
brainwash at least to children at the
very least you have to brainwash the
children because they can't make
decisions
now you could argue that adults can
either
but certainly with children we don't
agree
so you have to brainwash children
later you can teach them critical
thinking and maybe they'll change their
opinions on things but they would do it
somewhat on their own
um
however
it appears that the CIA got out of that
business for a while until Obama put him
back in that business
through legislation
so
once you know that the that the
intelligence Services of the United
States can legally
legally brainwash the citizens and
there's actually a utility to it it's
not all bad
um then you have to say to yourself what
are they brainwashing us with well at
the moment
they're brainwashing us with wokeness
because they could make it go away
they could make it go away
if the CIA or whoever you know here's a
phrase that I saw in a article by Jacob
Siegel in writing for a tablet
and it's called a guide to understanding
The hoax of the century 13 ways of
looking at disinformation
the problem is in our current situation
the intelligence entities of the United
States have formed working relationships
with social media and the news
now the way they approach it is that
they're going to help the news and hope
help social media remove disinformation
so who says no to that you go to the
news you say hey we know what's true and
what isn't wouldn't you like to report
True News
what's the news going to say
of course of course you know tell us
what's true
you know they might check it but at
least they'd want to know what's true
so if you have an entity that is selling
itself as the correctors of
disinformation
they really are in control of your
information
you've given them control of your minds
because you've decided that some entity
can tell you what's true and not true
and believe me they don't know
they don't know
they're just going to tell you a version
that they think is to their best
interest
so we have a situation where our media
is completely and here's the
phrase I want to read from Jacob Siegel
because he said it so well he said the
American Press once the guardian of
democracy was hollowed out to the point
that it could be worn like a hand puppet
by the U.S security agencies and party
operatives
the media is so hollowed out it could be
worn as a hand puppet
by the CIA U.S security agencies and
party operatives
perfect
first of all is great writing because
it's visual secondly
it it just captures the entire situation
yeah so we're so addicted to watching
the news that we think is real even when
we know it's not real we act like it is
I do that every day I know the news
isn't real
and I still act like it is
and I can't break myself of the habit
I tell myself well
you know I'm working on this assumption
or you know it's a it's a it's real
until it changes you know I tell myself
ridiculous things but what I should tell
myself is none of it's real
because it's not the facts might be real
but the narrative in which it is
presented is always artificial
so
um I do believe in pausing AI but how in
the world do we get AI to be free
from the same things that corrupted our
media which is intelligence agencies
how do you keep intelligence agencies
from owning AI
can you
I don't think it's possible because they
have more power and they're better at it
see here I think this is my speculation
the way intelligence agencies can co-opt
social media managers and and news
people
is that when the CIA or somebody you
know like FBI somebody official
comes in and meets with you
and they say hey let us be partners and
let us help you the first thing you
might think is oh
I've got a partner
free partner maybe it's free maybe it's
not but I've got this partner like
they'll help me
but the trouble is intelligence agencies
are never your partner
they're always your boss
they're always your boss they're never
your partner they might come in as your
partner but try to do something they
don't want
see how that goes
right and some of it is ego
imagine you're the CEO of whatever news
entity
and the CIA asked for a meeting
what does that do to your brain
you're in charge and the CIA has to meet
with you because it's important to
National Security and you're important
yes you you're important to National
Security and you know we really think
you're great
and we'd like to work with you to help
you because you're so important we'd
like to help you be even more effective
and by the way we can tell you some
stuff that you wouldn't have known
otherwise do you like some Insider stuff
would you like to tell your family that
you meet with the CIA yeah you would
sounds kind of sexy doesn't it makes you
look kind of powerful you'll like it
let's be partners
so I don't think they need to force
anybody to do anything
I think they just have to associate with
them and then people start doing what
they want is somewhat automatic
somewhat automatic
all right given that the news is not
reliable
I would like to propose a way of
dealing with the news
this is how to deal with the news when
you don't believe it's necessarily
reliable
I'll call it the working assumption
model
the working assumption now a working
assumption doesn't mean you believe it
it means that the evidence suggests
something's true and unless something
disproves it that's your working
assumption let me give you some examples
there's no evidence that the Mexican
cartels have corrupted the government of
the United States in a in a big way
right would you agree there's no
evidence that I'm aware of that the
government of the United States is
already corrupted by the cartels
I've never seen any evidence of that
however
given what we see which is a complete
lack of interest in dealing with the
cartels effectively my working
assumption is that the government is
already compromised
I don't know this is true but everything
I see supports that working assumption
so if I said it's true well then I would
be lying because I don't know that it's
true but if I say the most practical
working assumption is that the
government has already been corrupted
what would you do
how would you act differently
I'll tell you how I would act
differently I would arm
because we might reach a point where
these citizens have to get rid of the
cartel and the only way that's going to
happen is with Superior Firepower
if the government is out of the game
that doesn't mean the game's over
the game isn't over because the
government decided to set it out now the
game is on
and you better arm yourself because the
cartels have already wiped out the black
gangs did you know that
this is Peter zahan's uh
provocative idea he says that the the
reason that the murder rate dropped
is because the cartels murdered the
murderers The Gangs they just murdered
the murderers and took over their
business have you ever wondered why you
don't hear much about the Crips and the
Bloods lately
they're dead
not all of them obviously but apparently
their power has been diminished and
completely gutted by the cartels
now the cartels are more dangerous in
one way even though they murder less
believe it or not that when the cartel
completely owns a place the murder rate
goes down
it's only when they don't have control
that the murder rate is high when the
murder rate goes down that's trouble
worry the most when the murder rate goes
down because that means the cartel
already has control
so working assumption is that our
government is already compromised by the
cartels
I love it to not be true but I have to
act like it is true because the
government is acting as if it's true as
well
um here's another one
there's no evidence that I'm aware of
that our elections were rigged in the
sense of vote counting no evidence at
all
however
the fact that our elections are not
fully auditable and there seems to be no
interest by our government to make them
fully auditable
my working assumption is that they're
rigged or will be
they're either rigged or they will be
now I don't have evidence of that it's a
working assumption under the context of
a a press that isn't dependable
and a government that is obviously not
working on a gigantic problem completely
ignoring it
the working assumption is that the
elections are rigged
or that they will be soon
is that fair again let me be as clear as
possible I don't have that I don't have
proof of it
if I said I had any kind of proof or
even strong evidence that would be a lie
what I have is a working assumption
based on living a life of you know who
you trust and who you don't sorting
things into those buckets and say well
that's what it looks like it's my
working assumption
all right
um
here's uh here's another one The Tick
Tock band
so the country wanted to ban Tick Tock
it appeared that there were some
bipartisan support
but instead of a simple bill that bans
Tick Tock we got something called the
restrict Act
from
say senator Warner I believe Democrat
but the restrict Act is not targeted at
Tick Tock in fact I believe Tick Tock is
not mentioned
rather it gives broad powers to the
government
to determine if there is foreign
influence you know in any of our
communication social media structure
and it can go after any of that foreign
influence
you know with the powers of the
government
here's the problem
why are they doing that who asked for
that
do you remember a big American Uprising
saying give the government more power
over all our social media
when did that happen no there was a
problem
huh there was a problem with Tick Tock a
specific Tick Tock problem if if the
government is not working on the problem
as clearly defined and instead is
looking to increase its powers more
generally
what would you assume what's your
working assumption
my working assumption is it's a corrupt
process and it's just a power grab and
it's just political and has nothing to
do nothing to do with solving the
country's risk nothing to do with it
now is that true
I don't know I have no idea
but it's my working assumption
it's a it's a reasonable working
assumption here's what I say I say that
if you say something's true your enemies
can say it's false so don't do that
don't say it's true when the when the
other side just says well let's prove it
you can't prove it nope just say if
anybody wants to change my mind it's
pretty easy
do you know how you can change my mind
on tick tock
produce a bill just about Tick Tock and
then if you want you can also have a
bill with this other restrict stuff in
it and then let Congress vote on them
separately
one to be on Tick Tock which is what we
all want and one let's talk about it
maybe they have an argument that I'm not
aware of
on the surface it looks like a big
mistake just a power grab that the
citizens aren't going to like in the
long run
but I'd listen to it I just don't want
it combined with the thing that I want
to solved which is tick tock
see how easy it would be to change my
working assumption
with that little change a little change
just tiny little change just make a
separate Tick Tock bill
I would say okay it looks like the
government's trying to protect me and
they've got some ideas I didn't think of
so we better talk about those as well
how could they prove me how could they
change my working assumption about
Fentanyl and the cartels already owning
them simple
just attack the cartels or announce that
you're going to or or get tough or close
the border
lots of stuff
there's probably five different things
they could do to change my working
assumption and none of them are hard or
well none of them are undoable
all right about my uh
what else
no well you get the idea it's easy to
change my working assumption don't claim
things are true
claim that your working assumption
based on the facts
can be changed
so you could basically you would put the
burden of proof back on your accusers
here's the normal way it goes I believe
X is true then your Democrat critic
usually says you don't have proof of
that
there's no court that said that's true
show me a link show me some evidence
show me some data there's no no evidence
you're just often Crazy Town
but instead you say well the situation
suggests that this is true if you'd like
to disprove it it's easy to do I welcome
you to disprove it I'd love to know it's
not true
so you want to put the burden of proof
on the other side that instead of having
them put it on you so stop the certainty
and say well this is what it looks like
so that's my working assumption if
they'd like it not to look like that
they know how it's easy to make it look
not like that
it's real easy
but they're not doing it as long as
people aren't doing the easy thing to
solve the obvious problem
you can have a working assumption that
they're corrupt
you can that's completely reasonable
all right let's talk about the uh
Nashville shooting that I hate to talk
about because it just makes more of them
but I guess this one has some details
that made it interesting
um as Tucker Carlson and other people
have noted
apparently the shooter left a Manifesto
which one presumes is a complete
explanation of motive
that's what a Manifesto is right
a yetis but not been released to the
public
and the officials who have seen it say
they don't know the motive
what's your working assumption
the working assumption and this this is
way uh Tucker handled it and I think
that was correct the working assumption
has to be that they're hiding it from
you for a reason
what would be a good working Assumption
of why they would hide it from you
well I'll tell you the most obvious
interpretation for which I have no proof
for which I have no proof
the obvious working assumption is that
it was a trans person who was declaring
war on
possibly Christians
now do we have any direct evidence of
that nope nope there's no direct
evidence of that in fact my first
interpretation was it was just a school
and I think that's it's very likely that
will still be the final interpretation
that it was just a school it wasn't
about religion at all
um
but at the moment given the lack of
information about the manifesto I think
a good working assumption is that it was
about Christianity
and and the news or the government
doesn't want you to know that
because it might just make things worse
now I'm not totally
criticizing that
you know as much as I think that Freedom
of Information is good for us in general
and it is
this might be one of those special cases
where we're better off not seeing it
because I doubt that it represents
anything like a widespread opinion
if it did then maybe I'd want to see it
if it's just a crazy person babbling I
don't want the right-leaning news to say
well this represents trans people
yeah look at this one case of this
Manifesto that's that's how we'll
understand trans people from now on
so I don't feel like
were necessarily better off with with
seeing it
but I don't like the way the
government's treating us
you know what you know what I would have
respected I would have respected saying
you know what we don't want you to see
it
I actually would have been perfectly
good with that
because that would be honest
that would be honest
you know we've seen it we're going to
deal with it it does tell us something
we didn't know we're not going to show
it to you
believe it or not I would be okay with
that
believe it or not
because I'm completely okay with there
is some information I know you want to
know we're going to keep it from you
we think it's in your best interest
now depending on who says it and what
the context is I might not believe it
but in this case I would in this one
simple unique case if the FBI said you
know honestly we just don't want you to
see it
I'd be okay with that now I can totally
understand if people were not
I understand that as well but I feel
like his only use is political
talk me out of it does that would seeing
that would seeing the manifesto have any
use besides political points
I don't think so
I don't think so and we already know
what the point would be right
if the government kept it from you you
would already know what it says
or at least your working assumption
would be
if they kept it from me my working
assumption would be if some trans person
who declared war on Christians
I wouldn't have any I would have no data
to prove that
but that would be my working assumption
and you know I'd be okay with that
I'll be okay with that
because I wouldn't really be in the dark
I would just be okay they they kept a
political football off the field yeah
that's okay
yeah all right so
um and then there's a question of why
there seems to be a I don't know why why
are we treating a potential uh hate
crime against Christians as different
than we would treat other hate crimes
but I guess it's a little unconfirmed at
this point so that's part of it and
Tucker also asked the question uh why
don't we ask if antidepressants were
involved
now this question has a lot more
salience to me
than it might to you because I've
actually experienced as most of you know
when I took some blood pressure meds
that were not to my liking
um I was suicidal
and it was just the meds literally the
day I stopped boom everything was fine
and everything's been fine every day
since then
and you know what's interesting is that
you know by some other measure you might
say but Scott how could you be happier
now
when you've had a whole bunch of bad
things happen to you in the last year
and the answer is
I guess I just had the right mindset
you know these allegedly bad things
don't seem so bad to me you know the
upside seems so substantial to them like
this came out that came out okay
but over the summer when I was on the
wrong meds there was nothing that could
go right
I just wanted to get out of this world I
just wanted to get out of this world
and when I stopped the meds it went away
now
it's easy for me to understand how
people and it would be different for
individuals it's easy for me to
understand how a drug could make you a
mascular
because if it made you suicidal
at the same time you had you know
negative thoughts about something else
the suicidal part could make you a
murderer because if you don't care about
your own life you're not going to care
about anybody else's life after you're
gone
so
anyway
so we should definitely look at uh
antidepressants and I thought that that
was super Brave of Tucker to say it on a
TV program
which I believe is largely or used to be
anyway sponsored by a big Pharma
imagine how much balls it takes
to say that your advertisers might be
causing mass murder
that's like a lot of balls
now I realize Tucker is in a in a strong
situation career-wise but you've got to
have balls the size of a planet
to say on the very platform that's
supported by big Pharma money
somebody says no Pharma ads on Tucker
and I was wondering about that because
I've never seen any
there's probably a reason for that right
yeah
so I think that was a valuable service
by Tucker Carlson just sort of putting
these ideas out there
of course Madonna is gonna
have a concert in Nashville to raise
money for Trans rights
I'm not sure she's reading the room
right
but can we just agree that this any
story about Madonna is a story about
mental illness
would you agree with that I don't know
what's happening with Madonna but my
working assumption
I'm not a doctor I'm not a doctor I
can't diagnose her from a distance but
the way she presents is with mental
illness
pretty severe pretty severe
you know the the kind where if she were
not famous and Powerful somebody would
have forced her into treatment of some
kind
um
but I also think that the trans story
is at least partly about mental illness
now because I have more respect than
some of you do let me say as clearly as
possible
I think is super super likely
that for some portion of the trans
community
transitioning was exactly what they
needed and it made their life better
I just don't know what the percentage is
I don't know if that's 10 or 90 because
I don't have visibility but whether it's
10 or 90 it's the same point we live in
a free world or we try to be we're
trying to be free if they're adults
they've looked into it they think they
need it they talk to professionals
that's their business it's not my
business it's just their business and
I've never had a problem treating any
trans person
as a human individual with dignity ever
before
I don't know why I'd have that problem
in the future
but there does it does seem that it has
created a magnet for crazy people
right which is no fault of the
law-abiding you know good citizens who
just have a you know different situation
that they found a way to deal with
it's not about them it's about some
portion have been attracted to this for
all the wrong reasons
and if you can't say that the trans
issue is both things
you know legitimate people looking at
legitimate Solutions
that their freedom allows them to pursue
versus people who are just bad
crazy
as soon as you lump them together and
say it's all trans well there's nothing
you can do
there's nothing you can do with that
as soon as you lump them into one
category and I think that's what the
right does to their to their detriment I
think it weakens the argument to just
treat it like it's all one thing
um
so I think the Madonna thing really
underscores that
uh Rasmussen asked about preventing mass
shootings
an arrest was in poll 50 percent of
Voters say it's not possible to
completely prevent mass shootings well
shouldn't that be closer to 100 percent
that only 50 percent of people pulled
agree it's not possible
well it's not possible to stop them all
I think everybody would agree with that
how do you only get 50 to agree with
that all right well but 38 believe it is
possible to completely prevent such
shootings okay that's crazy
and other 12 are not sure
it's a weird little poll
so I suggested
well actually I stole an idea somebody
sent me a letter and I like the idea but
I extended it
so the idea that was not mine was to
recruit ex-police officers
to be teachers
would you like to know that there were
some legally armed ex-police officers
who just had become teachers
so that if your school wanted to be a
little safer just make sure that of your
I don't know 100 teachers how many
teachers at a school
what would be an average
number of teachers a hundred
fifty two hundred
something like that let's say 50 to 100.
you wouldn't need many of those to be
cops
two
three
two or three percent being retired
police officers because you know if
you're getting out of the police game
and a lot of people are because the
changes to you know bail and everything
else if a lot of people are leaving the
police force
you have exactly the pool of applicants
you're looking for some of them might
yeah now you can extend it to
ex-military as well that's correct but
here I
um but I wanted to extend the idea even
further
so I tweeted that what if the federal
government or maybe you could leave it
to the states that's a separate argument
but what if uh what if funding was made
available either in the state or federal
level
that anybody who wanted to be a legal
a carrier of a weapon
could take the classes or get certified
in whatever whatever certification and
maybe have to get re-certified every
year and then keep the weapon in some
kind of a
protected safe in a few places
so you want to make sure that people can
get to them quickly but you don't want
the kids to get them obviously so some
kind of a safe
a holster well somebody can grab your
holster
you know if three kids wanted to they
could hold you down and take your weapon
so I don't want it in a holster
unless they're actually a security guard
then yes but not in the classroom we've
seen too many videos of of students
taking on teachers
students will take on teachers they will
steal their gun I think that's like a
real thing
there's Biometrics for holsters
interesting
I'm not sure I would trust a biometric
for a holster because you still might
want to steal it and get rid of the
biometric somehow
um
so that's just one idea speaking of
which uh I saw a tweet from Emily Brooks
saying that there was a quoted shouting
match between representative Jamal
Bowman Democrat and representative
Thomas Massey
and then I watched the video when I
watched the video do you think I saw a
shouting match
this is the way all headlines work
there's a shouting match and then I
watched the headlines nope nope there
was one person shouting
uh Jamal Bowman and then there was a
Plucky representative Thomas Massey who
happened to be walking by the public
hallway who wrote Under wherever it was
he just happened to be walking by and so
as Jamal is just like screaming at the
crowd in like every direction he's just
you know screaming his gun control stuff
Thomas Massey just walks right up to him
and just starts talking to him calmly
about a suggestion for I think for
arming teachers
and Jamal just keeps yelling and yelling
and messy just keeps you know keeps to
his same tone and they're at one point
they're just talking each other over
each other and then Thomas Massey sees
it is being filmed
so he you know sort of excuses himself
from the shouting guy and goes to talk
to that it was probably as a phone or a
news reporter or something and and he
starts to give his idea directly to the
video
and then the the shouting guy comes over
and tries to shout him away from the
video so he can't even he can't even say
his idea
all right every day I'm finding a new
reason to to love Thomas Massey I just
love the fact that he just walked right
up to him and started talking to him
with a productive suggestion
and the guy wouldn't even listen to it
wouldn't even listen it was awesome
all right
um here's uh one of the best
and scariest ideas I've ever heard
um how many of you were in favor of
universal basic income where the
government gives you money and you don't
have to work you just have enough to
live
right
pretty much in this audience it's going
to be old now right oh a few yeses a few
yeses all right here's a hidden danger
of Ubi that I'd never thought of
and you're going to say to yourself oh
how did I not think about that are you
ready for this I'm going to bend your
mind courtesy of uh Tweeter called the
Commander in Chief one
uh it's all one word the
commander-in-chief and then digit one if
you're looking for this person on
Twitter
and here's the tweet that just blew my
top of my head off are you ready for
this seriously this is going to blow
your head off
hold on to your scalp here it comes
they can talk about a universal basic
income as much as they like any smart
any smart person will know where this is
going
but I didn't know where this was going
so I don't qualify as smart let's see if
you did
here's where he says it's going
they will not be interested in keeping
keeping people around who cannot be
useful
that's what I realized
before
yeah suppose we can't create a society
where let's say 30 percent of the people
are
are just
um
just using the money of the other people
and they're not working
now in our current woke Democratic world
that's pretty safe
if you were to introduce Ubi if you
could afford it somehow and you
introduced it into America
and let's say ten percent of Americans
took you up on it
because it's safe it would be it would
be not that big of a burden on the
country ten percent they're probably
getting some kind of services anyway
and you'd say to yourself well I'll
never even meet one I'll probably never
even run into anybody who's on the Ubi
it's no big deal but imagine it got to
like 30 percent
imagine if one third of adults
were not working and they were just
taking your money your money
the money you work for
so you get to work and have a good life
and they get to do no work at all and
spend your money
now presumably they would have fewer
things they'd have to live a more basic
life but probably they could be just
happy doing their Fentanyl and whatever
now in the short run that could work in
the short run
in the long run you can never be sure
that a death spot won't take over
am I right history has shown us that
every civilization ends everyone they
all end or they become a different thing
what if what if the United States
becomes a dictatorship
and what if we don't have enough money
to feed everybody
they're going to kill all the Ubi people
first they're going to round up the Ubi
people starve them to death and say all
right we have a chance now we got rid of
the we got rid of the anchor that was
holding us back I'm glad they
self-identified as useless because we
got rid of them nobody even argued oh
you're going to get rid of the useless
people
and it wouldn't even be racial because
it would be you know distributed across
races and everything so you say it's not
even racial it's just all the useless
people all the people who add nothing to
society will just round them up and put
them in camps or Kill Them All
had you ever thought about that
had you ever considered that you're
guaranteeing the death of the people who
stopped working
and I'm going to generalize this to a
bigger point
there's no such thing as Security in
this world
you're never safe
you could have the illusion of being
safe and you could be safer than other
situations so you can be safer
but you can never be safe we don't live
in a safe world
but one thing you can do to make
yourself as safe as you can in a
dangerous world is to be useful to other
people
nothing is going to help you more than
that
all of your happiness
all of your financial success
all of your physical safety
is going to depend on how useful you are
to other people
if you're taking a Ubi and you're
nothing but a drain on other people
don't expect to be safe
do not expect to be safe because other
people don't care about you at that
point they really don't if you're just
going to take my money and give me
nothing in return
good luck you're on your own
so I would argue that the more you
create your talent stack
the the safer you are
right why was it that I wasn't panicked
when I got canceled worldwide in my
primary profession for 34 years why did
it not send me into a death spiral
because my talent stack is so well
developed I knew I could just do other
things
and So within a day I was already
spinning up my other things and they're
working fine
and it's only because I've spent a
Lifetime on developing a set of skills
that I know work together and have
commercial value
if you don't have that going on
you're not safe
you can only make yourself safe by
developing a talent stack that helps
other people in some way they find Value
in it
that's your advice for today
well I don't know if I said this
yesterday but Governor Newsom got
himself in a trap by commissioning this
group to recommend reparations then they
came back with an absurd number that
some are saying would cost 800 billion
dollars two and a half times two and a
half times the annual budget of
California according to NBC
so now Newsome has two choices if he
backsues uh reparations
he has no future in politics would you
agree
he has no future in politics if he backs
the reparations but
if he doesn't back them
he has no future in politics not
National politics yeah it might make he
might be able to get reelected
probably not but he would certainly be
out of the race for president there's no
way he could be president right that
would be completely dead so he can't he
can't accept it
because then he'd be dead and he can't
reject it
because then he'd be dead
politically so what are you going to do
you can't accept it you can't reject it
resign no he's going to form a new
committee to study the recommendations
of the first committee
that's what I would do
that's what I would do I'd form a new
committee
to look into the committee's
recommendation and then I would wait a
year and see if see if everybody forgot
about it
and maybe you know maybe release it on a
late Friday afternoon it looks like it
wasn't practical
well we tried but the committee that
examines the committee found that the
first committee didn't do his job as
well as it could so I guess it's dead in
the water
it's a good thing I asked the committee
to look at the other committee
now every path he takes on this is the
losing path but that's the least losing
path so I predict it
all right uh meanwhile over in Minnesota
Governor Tim Walls uh did a big event in
which he introduced and announced a new
Chief Equity officer Dr Stephanie
barrage Chief Equity officer
if you're looking for a state to move to
I would recommend one that does not have
a chief Equity officer that should be a
giant red flag to stay away from that
state
as far away as you can why because
they're racists do you think a white
male could have been hired as the first
chief chief Equity officer
seriously do you think a white male
could have been considered for the job
of course not a course
not
of course not is purely racist
what's the definition of racist you're
hiring people based on their race
there's no way they would have
hired a white man for the job
why would you move to that state
that state has a big sign on it that
says no white man allowed women I don't
know maybe women but white men no nope
can't get a job in Minnesota
it's pretty clear
all right
um
uh speaking of Governor Newsom he
tweeted a two charts one is a chart of
the state of the the states that have
lots of guns and or the states have the
most strict gun control
and I found that uh when you have the
strictest gun control it correlates
really high with
fewer murders
now what do you think of that
so the data probably came from good
sources
well well let's say the data is accurate
we don't know it's accurate of course
that would be ridiculous but let's say
it is
how many problems do you think there
were there are with that comparison
a lot of them
a lot of them all right let me give you
just the sampler set of problems
which for some reason I didn't include
in my notes
here's the sampler set
if you're looking at Estates and
comparing a state to a state do you
think that's a good comparison
because California shows up as a low
murder state with high gun restrictions
but you can't go near Oakland
you can't go anywhere near Oakland I
drive around Oakland I don't even want
to drive through it
is so dangerous
right
so yeah Compton Etc so the the use of
states is meant to conceal what's true
not to tell you what's true would you
agree
that the almost all the murderers are in
cities
well you know the vast majority are in
cities
and if you don't break out in City to
City so what I'd like to see is
strictest gun laws
by City
I think you'd find that Chicago has
strict gun laws and a high murder rate
Washington DC strict gun laws High
murder rate Oakland strict gun laws High
murder rate
Baltimore strict gun laws High murder
rate right so you can see how easily
Newsome can lie with accurate numbers
now you're saying the numbers might not
be accurate and I agree
but even if the numbers are accurate
he's found the only way to be misleading
by grouping it by state
instead of by City
it makes the whole thing ridiculous
then you'd also want to see a before and
after
show me the murder rate in let's say
Chicago before and after the gun control
strict regulations went into place did
it immediately fall
that'd be a strong argument or did it go
up
which I think he did
yeah so those just a few problems if if
you looked at the comments on that tweet
you'd see other people suggesting other
problems we've reached the point where
data is absolutely useless data
all right and so I tweeted this
um here's here's where we're at this is
my summary of everything you need to
know about data
um
dumb people
argue without data would you agree
if somebody's making their argument and
they're ignoring the data or they don't
know what it is or they're not using it
that's pretty dumb pretty dumb
smart people argue with data would you
agree
if you see a smart person they're
probably showing you their data
but the smarter people the people who
are smarter than the smart people know
that you can torture the data until it
tells you anything you want to hear
right so summarizing so far if you're
dumb you don't use data
if you're smart you do use data if
you're smarter than that you know the
data is useless because it's been put
together by corrupt people
but there's one level above that
smarter than the smarter people these
would be the smart-ass people know that
the data is not real and neither are you
I'll just leave that there
all right um
Senator Mark Warren was defending his
restrict act that's the one that's
supposed to be aimed at Tick Tock but is
in fact a general statement about giving
the government more power over social
media basically even domestic
and he said this defending it he said
the restrict act isn't an infringement
on Free Speech it's a systemic
rules-based approach to identify and
addressing to identifying and addressing
foreign Tech that could threaten
National Security
huh now when he explains it that way
that doesn't sound so bad does it
wouldn't you like to know that our
government is has a rules-based approach
you know something you can really
there's no gray area it's a rules-based
approach he says and though you want
them to identify and address foreign
technology that can threaten National
Security
that's all good right
isn't that terrific
here's what I tweeted back to them we
don't trust the government with new
rules in other words Powers over
communication it's that simple
that's that's my my reply is we don't
trust you
that would be that what he's proposing
is something that would be good for
somebody that you trusted
am I right if we trusted the government
that probably makes sense it sounds like
they need some a little more structure
to look for bad intention from foreign
powers
sounds good but what happens if you if
you don't trust your government and you
think everything they do is a trick
which is my current operating belief
in that case you don't want to give them
any power for any reason because they're
not going to use it for good reasons
so his problem is not that it's a good
or a bad Bill
the problem is him
let me say that again
the problem is not Senator Warner's bill
because he defended that quite
adequately the problem is Senator Warren
Warner
Warner the problem is the senator
and the other Senators because we don't
trust them
am I right
he's defending the wrong thing he should
defend why we should trust him
not why we should trust the bill why we
should trust him
and he has no argument for that
sorry
because you know nobody's going to trust
the other party and nobody even trusts
your own party and it all looks
suspicious to me
so no you're not allowed to change the
topic the topic is you Senator Warner we
don't trust you
and if you say oh I have this other
senator who agrees with me oh that's
just another person I don't trust oh
you've also got Romney on your side
I don't trust him
I don't trust him
because he's in Congress basically
um
all right
if he put together a one-pager Banning
Tick Tock I might trust that
um
have you heard of uh the tartarian
theory of why civilizations
might disappear
how many of you heard this
this is the the greatest some call it a
conspiracy theory
some call it true
all right let me tell you what it is
it's an idea that there used to be an
advanced civilization on Earth
that built great structures from the
pyramids to even skyscrapers in New York
so that you know a lot of stuff is
included and that there was a great mud
flood
literally a bunch of mud that destroyed
that advanced civilization
but
the the buildings and structures that
remained were the tall ones
so that if you looked at the tall older
buildings or more ornate the less modern
ones you would find that they have many
stories below the ground
that used to be above the ground
[Laughter]
and that you don't know it but you know
it's been hidden from us that there was
a great society that got wiped out by
mud
now it's not real as far as I know
there's there's no reality to it but
it's the most interesting
the most interesting new Theory and
apparently there are there are some
examples of some buildings that do have
substantial below ground structure so
they use those as examples
all right so no I don't think that's
true
here's a story about uh female students
at the University of Wyoming
they were concerned and now they're
suing their sorority because a
trans-identified
um
they call it a trans identified male I
don't know if that's the wrong way to
say it or not but
um
yes a trans
no I think I think they're using the
wrong language here I think they I think
the polite language is there's a trans
person
who identifies as female
right so there's a trans person who
identified as female uh not the way they
were born
um at least physically not the way they
were born and it alleges that this trans
woman Artemis Langford has been quote
watching the women undressing the
sorority house sometimes wall erect
now my first question is why are all
these women who are undressing erect
I mean is it a clitoral thing I don't
understand it's possible that the
sentence is just confusing and what they
mean is that the trans person Artemis
Langford is erect not the women who are
undressing
okay I think that's probably what it
means all right
now here's my question
what's wrong with that
what's wrong with this trans woman who
still has male equipment having an
erection while uh in the company of all
these women who are just like Artemis
they're just other women
and would they have a problem if Artemis
had been a uh born a lesbian
wouldn't a lesbian I mean I don't know
too much about lesbian culture but am I
wrong would a lesbian be turned on by
saying a naked attractive women
is that a thing
I don't even know if that's a thing
is it a thing
so if a lesbian would be allowed in the
sorority and I assume they would be
right the sorority isn't going to
discriminate based on the LBGTQ stuff so
if you could be a lesbian
in the sorority
it seems to me that a trans who also
how does physical reaction to women
same thing
so I feel like they're discriminating
against this poor trans person for
having a penis
that doesn't seem right
because they you know they wouldn't
discriminate against lesbians
it's not the same
you can never tell when I'm serious can
you
am I serious
all right so what I'm doing is a little
bit of
you know basically accepting and
amplifying all right so I'm doing some
amplification to make a point
Embrace and amplify correct
so all right here is the most
provocative thing you'll ever hear in
your entire life something that I could
never even mention until I'd been
canceled
somebody says I look high I wish no I'm
not high right now believe it or not I
tell you if I were
you know I I live a
a transparent life when it comes to
marijuana I tell you if I were I'd just
tell you but I'm not
um all right here's the topic
and first you need to know where this
comes from all right here's my source
so my source is Tyrone Williams who's on
Twitter and goes by uh immune hack
you know at immune hack now
I don't know what's true
but I'll tell you what looks true
that's all I can do what looks true is
that Tyrone is a real person
a black American and the Black American
part is important to the story
all right
because if you didn't know that I was
quoting a black American man
uh you would think I'm the worst person
in the world for bringing up this topic
but it's not my topic I think it's
useful
I think is valuable I don't know if it's
true
but it has enough meat on the bones for
me to say I think Tyrone's on to
something
and I'm going to share it with you and
the biggest reason that you probably
won't have seen this is It's just so
dangerous it's like dangerous thoughts
you ready
here it comes remember this is from
Tyrone not for me and all of this is
meant to be constructive
right if it seems to you that this is
anything but trying to be helpful
for America then you're misinterpreting
I'm trying to be helpful
goes like this according to Tyrone
there are at least four or five health
related factors that can affect your
cognitive ability
um
of a baby and therefore the cognitive
ability of that baby when it grows up
some of those things include weight
if a mother is obese when delivering a
child the child has lower cognitive
function did you know that
or at least it's correlated let's say
it's correlated causation I think you
have to be careful about causation but
it's correlated
if you're obese your kid will have lower
cognitive functions now some some people
have rightly said are you sure you have
the causation right
maybe it's backwards it might be it
might be and that would be exactly the
kind of thing you want to look into but
it's not the only thing
other things associated with cognitive
function or vitamin D something called
inflammation il-6 something called
oxidative stress or CRP something called
omega-3 well we know what that is but
the ratio of Omega-3 to omega-6 and then
blood pressure
so all of those things are based on
science not guessing
but based on studies now do we do we
trust all studies
no
that Nicholas Fleming is yelling name
the Jew Scott name them
Nicholas believes that uh as some of the
people in this channel are that I'm
cowardly not mentioning the cause of all
problems which he believes are the Jews
we're going to be hiding you on this
channel
for more serious people
all right
sorry you're gone
um but here's the point that uh Tyrone
makes every one of these is treatable
don't have enough vitamin D add some
vitamin D don't have enough ratio of
this to that
improve your ratio blood pressure yes
weight yes inflammation yes so there are
a bunch of factors that can all be
treated
and here's the kicker
all of the things I mentioned are at far
higher rates in Black Americans
far higher rates
obesity for example listen to this one
this just blew my mind do you know that
uh 80 of black women are obese
but it's two-thirds of white women are
obese too two-thirds of white women and
80 percent of black women or obese
huh I wonder why the
I wonder why the birth rate is going
down
like sometimes sometimes the answers are
so obvious
all right let's not get into that though
all right so Tyrone's point which I
think is brilliant and brave is that
there are there are identifiable
completely treatable medical conditions
that might completely change the the IQ
differential between black Americans and
everybody else
now
my my biggest issue is that correlation
and causation are not demonstrated
right but you could test it
Justin Dunn needs to go away because he
also wonders why I'm not blaming the
Jews for everything
maybe because I'm not a crazy conspiracy
theorist
Maybe
all right
so what do you think of Tyrone's
approach you can see how toxic it is
right because as soon as you talk about
IQ difference even though IQ difference
is the primary indicator of success
um if it's true that black Americans for
a variety of reasons
are are giving birth
in a sub-optimal way health health care
Wise It's a sub-optimal way
why don't we take that seriously
at least test it you know you you could
take a county or a state and say you
know I don't know if this is a racist
Theory or if it's just good thinking so
let's just take a population of people
correct everything see how their kids do
by third grade
by third grade you'd know if it worked
wouldn't you
so here's what I say
um
what I say is uh if you can test it
small
and the the potential benefit would be
extreme and the cost to do it looks like
it'd be doable
because most of these things are
education plus you know some supplements
basically
so
I think that's worth doing I think
that's worth trying
third grade is the inflection point I
think you'd know by third grade
if it worked
what about the slippery slope
this slippery slope just so I clarify
uh Claire I'm gonna I'm gonna make you
go away for too many too many repeated
comments in caps
here's what I say about the slippery
slope
when people say slippery slope is lazy
thinking
meaning that there's nothing about a
slippery slope that tells you anything
about a topic
there are some things that will go until
something changes them
so that so I I prefer to say everything
will go forever
until something stops it
that's a more productive way to look at
it and usually something pops up to stop
it but usually after it's gone too far
right yeah you have to go too far before
you get the reaction so in my view
the the acronyms and the you know let's
say the wokeness
I think it's guaranteed to end
it's guaranteed to end
because it went too far
now if you if I believed in a slippery
slope I would say it will just keep
going forever
but you can already see the resistance
starting to pop up people willing to say
things they could even say out loud a
year ago they're willing to say it out
loud I mean even the fact that you know
uh people are saying seriously that the
trans situation is at least partly
Mental Health
not all of it
but some part of it is mental health
that's that's a brave thing to say in
public
under the current situation and I would
argue that the trans Community needs to
do a better job of
separating themselves from the crazy
parts right
just as uh
you know if you're a trump supporter you
want to separate yourself from the white
supremacist who might also like it it
makes sense for your brand to separate
yourself from The Crazies
so I think the uh
I think the trans Community would help
themselves and help the rest of us if
they helped us identify the crazy people
it's not it's not as easy for us I think
get the hell away
that's funny all right ladies and
gentlemen
this concludes the most shocking and
entertaining live stream
in all of reality
I don't think you'll see a better thing
today
that's my belief and I'm going to say
goodbye to the YouTube people for now
thanks for joining
and I hope you learned something bye for
now
