certainly be the highlight of human
civilization it's called coffee with
Scott Adams it's the finest experience
you'll ever have and if you think that's
enough no we are not the kind of people
who settle for just the most amazing
thing that's ever happened is that good
enough for us no no we're going to take
it up a notch and if you want to take it
up a notch two all you need is a
copper My Girl glasses tankers tell us
we're starting the canteen German flaska
Festival of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dope of being here today
the thing that makes everything better
is called the simultaneous step but it's
going to happen now go
save it save it
good
well if you have any trouble uh with the
signal on
YouTube if you were a subscriber you
could also be watching it on locals I'm
gonna let the locals
um feed be open for a little bit and
then if I remember I'm gonna lock it off
just for the subscribers but for the
moment it's open
so if anybody wants to join I'll leave
it open for a few minutes so you can see
what's happening over there
news is
wonderful today
you know if you do what I do these live
streams
you really hope that the news is going
to give you some good stuff
oh my god do I have good stuff today
and none of it is none of it is sad
it's all mostly just funny stuff the the
best kind of day all right let's let's
just start
uh we'll start slow and we'll build into
it okay
uh the one of the founders I don't know
or the founder of Airbnb is doing a side
business now making uh tiny Factory
homes for backyards now that's already a
big thing uh boxable I think musk is a
big investor in that but there are a
number of little uh Factory built tiny
homes and they're going to start in
California because California
uh despite what you think about my
state
California every now and then will do
something just right
you know that that you say oh damn it I
wanna I wanna hate my state and move out
and then they'll do something right
you're like okay one of the things
California did right very right like
super right you know like I don't have
anything to say about it except well
that was right
uh the state
uh overrode the local building I think
this is what happened the local building
requirements and said that if these
little Factory homes you know meet a
certain standard they can go anywhere in
your backyard with fairly
fairly broad you know
flexibility
so
uh
somebody having a problem on locals
I'll monitor that it's working fine for
me
but here's what I think I think it's a
you know big and growing industry and
that's interesting but there's something
more interesting coming
so these these little units would be
priced at the around the low three
hundred thousand dollars
for something in the 400 to 500 square
feet range like really tiny it's
basically a one person home or maybe a
couple who's very close
but
here's what I think is going to happen
the next phase is that these will not be
for just backyards
the next phase is somebody's going to
build a community
of just these things now it might not be
one company it might be you know boxable
will be your neighbor and maybe this
Airbnb thing will be your house and you
know another company will do anything
but if you build a small community
that's well designed
so they have some common you know
transportation and they've got a park
that they build around they've all got a
nice you know green zone
and here's the most important part
essential cafeteria
for food delivery or pickup because they
could just walk to it
so that nobody needs to ketchup I think
these little units have kitchens but you
know that that would just be for a
little extra
so imagine if your food was cafeteria or
created you could just it's two blocks
away and you just walk over there and
pick up your food anytime you want
you know you pay for it but you get it
anytime you want
um I think that would be the model
because it's based on a college campus
model that you know where I went to
college and
here's what I experienced
my highest lifestyle was my college dorm
and it had everything to do with the
fact that everything was convenient so I
never had to do you know house
maintenance I never had to I didn't have
to drive
right I didn't have to cook I didn't
have to shop
so all the things that I need to do that
are a pain in the ass I didn't have to
mow my lawn you know I didn't have a dog
You could argue whether that's good or
bad but everything was easy
and then they and then they surrounded
me with people I wanted to be around
young people my age
it was like a perfect situation and plus
I was doing something useful you know
going to school so I felt I was
productive and all that and so my point
is not that you would reproduce a
college environment but that we don't we
don't engineer a community
to be the most livable Community it
could be communities are optimized for
what
you tell me
any new development wherever it is what
is it optimized for
what do they optimize
sales
that's it sales
right so that's the reason that you
don't have good closets
the reason that you don't have enough
closet space in your house is that when
you're looking to buy a home you don't
notice
you know like I didn't really notice
there wasn't enough closet space until I
bought it so you need you need to build
homes that are optimized for the
Community not for the seller
so that's something coming
uh this is just a prediction I don't
know but I've been watching the news and
I I feel like a pattern is developing
and I feel like we might be only one
week away from the following news item
the AP announces that Satan is actually
an FBI informant
yeah beezlebove himself turns out you
thought he was operating independently
but now for years it turns out that he
was actually an FBI informant the entire
time
you've heard of that group ISIS
they were never real
all FBI informants the entire
organization I know seems weird
Hitler's SS
it's kind of historical
but we not we now know
all FBI informants I know weird this
like before the FBI wasn't it
um or was it
what was the FBI started
30s 20s 20s right yeah in the 20s
all right
let's talk about Ray apps I saw a video
of a young I'm guessing conservative
type fellow who got a chance to ask a
public question of Liz Cheney as some
event
and he asked her would she
supports
um jailing reyeps as a insurrectionist
given that we have him on video saying
insurrectiony things like go into that
Capital
Etc and Liz chady gave the following
answer sort of a long rambling General
answer that at least Daniel Schmidt who
asked the question believes was avoiding
the question
but I'm not so sure
watch me
defend Ray Epps
you didn't see that coming did you
now I don't know what the real story of
rayap says and I'd like to know if there
is any real story might not be a you
know might not be anything
but here's what I say
why would Ray Epps be be arrested
don't you have to have some evidence of
a crime
why the hell would he be arrested I saw
the video I didn't see anything illegal
did you
you can't be arrested for standing
outside and agitating can you was
anybody else arrested for saying hey go
do something
uh so here's here's my take
it might be illegal
it might be illegal to incite
but do you think anybody else was
arrested who did not go into the capital
and did not do violence
was anybody else arrested
you say yes you're saying somebody was
arrested who did not trespass
and did not do violence
they weren't even inside the building
you're saying people outside the
building who were just standing there
saying things were arrested all right
you need to give me a fact check on that
you're going to need to give me a
specific example of that
I need a specific example because I
don't believe there was anybody who
wasn't trespassing who got it who got
arrested
all right if if you're right then I'll
then I'll adjust my opinion okay
so I'm seeing Brandon straka mentioned
didn't he go inside
Brandon didn't get inside
no
what was he doing at the time of arrest
because if he wasn't inside and he
wasn't doing violence then he was just
doing what everybody else who didn't get
arrested was doing
really he was standing there and he got
arrested he was standing there not
trespassing
okay I don't believe you honestly I
don't believe you you could be right so
let me say this as clearly as possible
I won't be shocked if I'm wrong I won't
be shocked and I'd be willing to be
corrected on that but I don't think
you're right
even Erica the excellent is saying she's
100 sure I'm wrong
okay
um
make your make your case you know not
right now but send me uh
oh Erica actually spoke and spoke to
Brandon
all right but
did everybody standing around him get
arrested
why was he singled out
just just answer that one thing why was
he singled out
because he must have been in a huge
crowd
all right there's something missing in
the story I hate to say I don't trust
Brandon straka but
uh if he said he was picked out of a
group of people who are doing exactly
what he was doing
then there's more to the story
he was famous you think that's why maybe
but how many how many police officers
would have recognized him
I wouldn't even recognize him I've seen
him on Twitter a million times I
wouldn't recognize him
I mean I can get a picture in my head
but if I saw him in a crowd
I doubt I'd recognize him
they might have it's possible they did
all right so here is my uh statement
um
Liz Shady also said that no uh no
information was ever presented to her
that would suggest he was part of the
FBI or part of you know some undercover
thing
so
if Ray Epps was one of the people who
didn't get arrested doing the same stuff
well let me say it differently
if some people did get arrested let's
say Brendan stroka let's say that he got
arrested for no good reason
and that's bad and that should be fixed
but would you agree with the following
statement
there were plenty of people who didn't
get arrested
who were doing roughly what Ray Epps was
doing inciting and saying bad things but
they didn't hurt anybody and they didn't
trespass
so if there were hundreds of people who
didn't get arrested
for doing what rayaps did is it shocking
that he didn't get arrested
because I don't think I don't think law
enforcement wanted to arrest hundreds of
people
I think they wanted to get the you know
the ones that make a point you know the
ones who are like notable
I don't know I'm not so let me be clear
I'm not defending apps because I don't
know what he was up to
I'm just saying that uh Liz Cheney's
answer wasn't that bad
right if we're if we're going to be a
little bit objective
she did not see evidence of him working
for the FBI
she didn't see it and she asked
and he was one of maybe hundreds of
people doing what rayups was doing
who also didn't get arrested
because probably you don't want to
arrest people who are just standing
there yelling
right
so so I'm going to accept your point let
me provisionally accept your point that
people were arrested
for doing what Ray Epps was doing which
is just saying stuff and not trespassing
but would you agree with me that the
vast majority of them were not arrested
could you say that
even if some were
the vast majority were not were they
do I believe her
um that's a good question
I feel like uh I would I feel like we
would know
if anybody had presented information
that Ray Epps was
Undercover
I feel like that would have gotten out
with somehow
know you
but you're right so I I take that
correction which is you can't believe
what a politician says
so okay I'll give you that
all right well let's leave that uh
interesting question
but I think
um could I could I at least let's see if
I could sell this
how many of you would be willing
if the Republicans you know dig into
this and they they satisfy themselves
that they know everything about rayaps
could you accept
if the right people looked into it
that he wasn't doing anything except
exactly what you saw he was just one of
the people there yelling stuff
could you accept that if it turned out
that was that was what came out
I could I could I could actually easily
accept it
I do I agree with every one of you who
says this is fishy and we need to look
into it yeah and really satisfy
ourselves that this is this is one of
those you can't sort of like Let It Go
I feel like we need to be like Pitbull
put pit bulls on this
you know the country needs to have like
an answer they can trust
but if the answer is he's innocent uh
I'll apologize publicly because I've
used his name in in this context as well
so if he so if rayaps deserves an
apology
I'm ready to give him one but not until
maybe some Republicans dig into it
all right let's talk about musk and
Twitter and all the fun stuff happening
there
so musca has already reinstated The
Babylon bee no big surprise
uh Kathy Griffin
good decision
Jordan Peterson
good decision and Andrew Tate
also a good decision
now I have to say it might be something
about Andrew
dates
as you know
I don't like him personally just because
we have some bad blood between us
but there's no denying he puts on the
show
right so so I'm going to model what I
what I like to tell you you should learn
to do
which is say whatever's the best thing
you can say about somebody you don't
like or somebody you oppose I I don't
like Andrew Tate I don't like him at all
but that's just personal if I'm being
objective
he is an energy monster
and the more you try to attack him the
stronger he gets he got canceled on
every platform and got twice as strong
okay I'm not going to ignore that you
can't ignore
the fact that he's one of the best
energy monsters in the country that's
just a fact he really is
I'm going to give him another compliment
they'll sound like a backhand compliment
because it probably is
I I saw a woman who is no no fan of his
on Twitter tweet a picture of him where
he wasn't wearing his Aviator goggles
and she was mocking him for not being
handsome basically
and
um here's my compliment
years ago and I've told you this story
probably a few times uh I was you know
self-deprecating about my own you know
baldness and uh and uh a bald guy told
me well if you go to the gym and work
out
you'll distract people from your
boldness and they'll see that you're fit
and then that will be sort of their main
idea when they they leave you is a wow
that's a fit person not like a bold guy
and so I I've taken that advice I I do
whatever I can to distract distract from
my weak points or
my head you know the the ugly face area
and try to change whatever I can change
so I try to improve my physique
to distract
he does that better than I've ever seen
anybody do it
because if I'm being honest you know
you're sort of in my category of not
really good looking guys
right if we're being honest neither of
us are good-looking but he does a great
job of working on his body and his whole
vibe you know he's got the cigar he's
got the he's got the beard the Beard's
sort of a concealment thing he's got the
uh the glasses and you know the whole
story and everything it's really well
done
now in terms of his philosophies
um I don't know if anybody follows him
enough to know where it all comes from
you can kind of see all the parts like
you see a little bit from me a little
bit from cernovich maybe a little bit
from Jordan Peterson maybe I'm not sure
what mix or who else but you can see
where it all comes from it's in in some
ways it's a little bit ordinary
a little bit ordinary I
I would say Jordan Peterson says new
useful things that you've never heard
before
um cernovich says new useful things in
ways you haven't heard before I try to
do the same thing
I'm not sure that Andrew Tate does that
I don't think he's adding to the
intellectual conversation but he
packages it brilliantly
and and here's what persuasion wise is
very strong so for here's why he's
actually pulled off that I have to I
have to give him like you know a sitting
Ovation for
he's basically selling a brand to men
he's primarily a brand that men follow
right and women get angry
some women follow him of course but
mostly he's appealing to a type of man
who wants a I don't know maybe some kind
of a role model for example but here's
the thing he's pulled off
he's managed to convince men
that following his example makes them
Alpha men
now I would argue that following his
example makes you obeyed a man by
definition
like if you're if you're following
yourself
and you're doing what you think is right
and you're just saying everybody
you might be an alpha maybe you might be
but if you're listening to Andrew
attained tell you how to be a man and
then you're smoking cigars and drinking
whiskey and looking at expensive cars
like he is
uh
I don't know that you're necessarily A
Alpha
I'm not even sure that Alpha and beta
makes sense like you know maybe
everybody's a little Alpha and a little
beta depending on the situation right uh
but
while while Andrew attained himself does
a great job of
you know presenting himself as an alpha
male
he pulls that off how did he convince
other men that following him and you
know praising him makes them alpha males
when in fact it does look exactly the
opposite
but he's pulling it off like he's he's
got over a half a million Twitter
followers and gigantic video so I have
to say
that for someone who has you know
starting with a set of talents he is
maximized he has maximized you know
where his talent leaves him because he's
got a good talent stack too so he's got
you yeah
somebody says he's an FBI informant
that would be amazing
I don't think that's true but it would
be amazing that would be the the
simulation giving us you know just what
you wanted
they make you affiliate money from
selling his program is that true
he makes money that way anyway anyway
he's he's a genuine interesting
character and I'll I'll I will give him
legitimately
skill
he is a very skilled guy well give him
that I just don't like him personally
all right so uh
then musk says
I also think that if there's ever a
nuclear Holocaust
it's entirely possible the only Survivor
will be Andrew Dean
he might be he just survived total
cancellation by the entire planet and he
came back stronger
he might be the only Survivor
in a nuclear Holocaust anyway
so musk does a poll asking people if
Trump should be reinstated
all right and what do you think of that
could we be more entertained
than Elon Musk buying Twitter and
running a poll on Twitter
to ask us if Trump should be reinstated
than this
Peak entertainment like I I just wake up
and go oh what's in the news today
so
uh the uh less I checked and I'm sure
it's changed it was 52 percent uh wanted
Trump reinstated the best comment on
this came from Kyle Becker
uh who is a real strong fellow I've said
it a number of times if you don't follow
Kyle Becker on Twitter you're missing
you're missing a good follow all right
so go follow him uh but yeah this joke
most of his stuff is news but he he
entered my domain a little bit today by
just doing a joke he did it so well I'm
gonna compliment him on it so uh
commenting on the the Trump poll
uh Kyle Becker tweeted uh Dems are going
to need to stop the count so they can
haul in some mail-in votes and they
followed up with hold up Maricopa just
dropped another batch
foreign
because I guess the the vote like
suddenly went anti-trump for a moment
all right great call back Kyle good job
uh then I saw some other conversation in
which uh musk was responding because
he's real active today yeah on Twitter
and uh
I took from the context of the comments
plus his his reaction
is that one of the things that Twitter
might become
is the ultimate polling place
now he didn't say that in direct
language but in context I was sort of
like picking up the vibe because right
now Twitter does these you know totally
unscientific little polls right
and but they're unscientific I think
they're still useful and fun but they're
unscientific how hard would it be
for Twitter to get a little more
information about you voluntarily you
know you only voluntarily and you can
say all right I am this demographic
and then have you randomly selected on
various questions and have Twitter push
you a poll
so you don't even have to be following
somebody it just pushes you a poll you
go oh I signed up for this because I I
volunteered to be one of the demographic
people who could be polled all right
I'll vote for this one
and and also and and musk also noted
that you would want the polls to be
separated by country
ever at the very least maybe a state in
some cases
but
what can you imagine that
imagine having something close to an
instant Pole that actually had
a lot closer to you know scientific
validity I don't know if you could get
there with volunteers I need somebody
who's smarter than me
to tell me if you could ever get a
random sample no matter how you how hard
you tried
if it's only Twitter users I don't know
if you can get there but you might be
able to might be able to get close
or at least close
so to me looking at that is enormous
like how much would that change
everything
if everything had an instant
like valid polls I don't know I'd love
that it just as a tool
well AOC continues to flirt with musk
and
answering the question of uh Trump being
reinstated AOC tweets
IDK meaning I don't know she goes I
don't know man last time he was here
this platform was used to incite an
Insurrection multiple people died the
vice president of the United States was
nearly assassinated and hundreds were
injured but I guess that's not enough
for you to answer the question
200 poll it is
um to which I responded to AOC
I said it's going to be hard to Gaslight
musk into believing Republicans staged
and Insurrection without firearms
only Democrats believe the entire hoax
catalog and then I published the entire
hoax catalog you know my list of of
hoaxes
I I don't you wonder what AOC does
if and when she sees that
you know I figure you know I don't know
since I'm a blue check but it doesn't
mean anything anymore I don't know if
she'd notice do you think AOC would
notice a comment for me
I notice I notice all the blue check
comments about me
do you think she would notice
maybe you know she probably gets so much
hate on her Twitter feed she might not
look at the comments
I'm not sure I would if I were
anyway
what do you what do you think her brain
does when she sees the hoax list
does she say oh those are not real and
just dismiss it as right-wing
probably yeah probably I don't think she
reads the list do you think she reads
the items on all 16 items on the list
I think so I doubt it
all right but
this gets us to the next fascinating
fact
CBS News announced on Twitter that it
might be taking a pause from using
Twitter do you know why
some kind of uncertainty about the
platform
yeah CBS News
has some uncertainty
about the platform
and then in a related news musk asks
what should we do next on Twitter like
he just tweeted that what should Twitter
do next
how much do you love that
what should Twitter do next from the
hand of Twitter
I I couldn't love that more and then you
see a bunch of people made suggestions
and he actually reacted to the
suggestions
he always said somebody said bring back
Alex Jones
he replied no
okay but the fact that he's actually
looking at the suggestions in detail
from anybody anybody you know there they
are he probably he probably looked at
300 suggestions this morning
so I made mine
to find out what is causing the
automatic unfollows
I'm going to tie this all together in a
minute
um I've talked about this before we know
it's been going on before and after he
took over
so people are definitely
definitely automatically being
unfollowed don't know why
but it's definitely happening apparently
it's not Tick Tock I thought Tick Tock
might have too many permissions and be
messing with your Twitter but very few
people who have who responded to my poll
on Twitter very few of them also had
Tick Tock but they were having this
problem
so it's not just Tick Tock if it's Tic
Tac at all might be other apps that's
possible other apps might be doing it
but don't know so I'd love to know that
now Will Young will will uh Elon Musk
see my comment
because the second time I've tweeted
Adam to find out what that's about
because here's why I think that's
important
I feel like if he found out why the
automatic unfollows are happening
he would find
the darkest
naughtiest part of Twitter
what do you think
now I can't rule out a technical bug
that could be like a weird technical bug
that under just the right condition
somebody gets unfollowed from you
accidentally could be you know that
would be exactly what a bug would do you
know that you can easily imagine that
being a bug
but do you think that bug could go on so
long without being caught it would be
like a five-year bug that's well
understood because I've been complaining
I complained to Jack Dorsey about it so
I think that's really high priority
find out where what the unfollow
business is all about because I think
you you probably are going to find the
nest of
bad behavior when you find that
or a bug and that would be good to know
as well
so
um
what do you think is going to happen to
all of the fake news gaslighting media
when Twitter starts fact checking them
now when I say fact checking I mean
including uh relevant contexts which
they're starting to do
so it used to be that only the right got
fact checked what's going to happen if
they all get fact checked
here's what I think
that's why CBS has to leave the platform
they can't handle being fact-checked
and I mean that that's not sometimes
they say things that sound like you know
a little bit of political you know team
play and just sort of a hyperbole team
thing this is not
they actually would not be able to
survive as a news organization if
anybody prominent fact checked them
they wouldn't be able to survive
it's a real problem yeah and here's the
weirdest thing because because reality
is just giving us so much entertainment
do you know what news entity is most
likely to survive that
which news entity is most likely to
survive fact checking on Twitter
 see you then
nope not Fox News I love my Fox News but
they're not gonna they wouldn't survive
fact checking that's just I'm sorry they
just wouldn't
they wouldn't
see you then
little CNN yeah because they
actually are executing on their plan to
be
closer to actual news they might be the
only one who can survive or the greatest
irony of all the greatest irony
anyway
um
so that's fun
um
there's a whole bunch of good news
happening uh there's now a competition
for ESG
so ESG is you know the environmental
social and governance stuff that
BlackRock and some other Financial
entities are trying to rank other
companies to say how wholesome they are
in terms of good for the country
according to these three things
and
now there's a competitor called strive
or strive funds all one word on Twitter
anyway I'm not sure if it's two words or
what but uh strive will only invest in
non-esg funds so now the free market
now the free market has provided
an alternative to ESG well that's what
we wanted
right that's all we wanted
so
don't you think ESG is just going to be
crushed
because by definition a non-esg will
have a wider palette of things to choose
from
and if they're looking for profitability
it seems like they'd find it
so I remind you that FTX that just went
out of business
had a very high ESG rating
and petroleum companies did not
so which one do you want to invest in
so that's good
uh I tweeted yesterday uh something I
thought would get probably when it got
me kicked off of Twitter in the old days
but uh but I'm getting braver now like
you could just you feel like you can say
the truth it still has to be the truth
but you can say it without hesitation
now on Twitter
if it's true
and here's what I tweeted I said I'm not
worried about climate change because any
species that can predict the average
temperature 100 years in advance won't
have any trouble handling climate change
that just just live with that for a
moment
if we're clever enough to know what the
temperature will be in 100 years
we're definitely clever enough to figure
out how to survive climate change
because one of those things is close to
Impossible
the other one
is just really really hard
if we can do impossible
I think we can handle really really hard
yeah we
and I would I would recommend that as
your holiday uh your holiday answer
so try that on your relatives
and then just walk away
I better refill my drink
I don't know so you want you want to do
it like this you know you'll be having a
you're having a sip of your beverage and
you'll be with your family members the
cousins you don't see that often and the
uncles and stuff and you
and they'll say you know climate change
is going to kill us all and you just
just sip your your beverage and just
take a step and go
ah
I don't know
I think a species that can predict the
sea level a hundred years from now won't
have much trouble handling climate
change
I need a refill and just walk away
just walk away
all right
um
Geraldo
is not pleased that Republicans get in
control of the house are going to go
launch investigations so here's what
we're all of those send and tweet
he said
Republicans get control of the house and
the first they do is no not explore how
to tape inflation or crime Etc they
launch an investigation of President and
Hunter Biden boring divisive retro
unwanted zero positive impact on the
lies American is this the real red wave
um
to which I say
first of all I love me some Geraldo I
love her although
do I agree with him all the time no no
but that's not my standard for why I
love him I love feraldo because he's my
role model of not being affected by
embarrassment
right that's a big part of his career
success is that that has balls
the size of Iowa
he is a Really Brave
individual not just physically he's
physically brave but he doesn't get
embarrassed and wow
is that something to learn from
but here was my comment to him about all
these investigations
it's not as if Republicans can pass any
legislation
the the public decided that we would we
would tie them up and not let them make
any more laws
so he voted ourselves a a totally
deadlock to Congress so that we would
make them not do stuff anymore because
they're doing too much stop doing stuff
do a little less
do a little bit less that'll be good
with us
so we got plenty of time because they
don't have to worry about legislation
but on top of that
that is my top priority
the hunter Biden investigation is my top
priority
now what do you say top priority it
doesn't mean it's the most important
thing in the world because you know
maybe that's defense or something else
but those other things are largely being
dealt with not perfectly could be better
but something's happening right there's
some activity going on but the hunter
Biden thing the laptop nothing is
happening
and I believe that the country really
really needs to know if those 50 Intel
professionals who said it was Russian
disinformation
are they working on the side of the
United States or not
that's a pretty big question
to know if our intelligence agencies are
working on the side of the United States
I would like to tell that you tell me
there's something more important than
that
I don't know what it is
so don't be gaslated into thinking any
of this is unimportant
some of the other investigations might
be gratuitous yeah revengey I don't know
but the laptop thing and whatever Hunter
was doing
we need to know that
that that's not trivial
that's right at the top we're fighting a
war
in Ukraine and in a sort of a war with
China in a different way and we don't
know if our commander-in-chief
is compromised
the reason we did the Russia collusion
investigations
was that there was enough it turned down
fake evidence but there was enough
reason to say uh I don't know if this is
true I think it's not true but if
there's any chance that a sitting
president is colluding with Putin
we probably need to know that right now
it turns out the evidence was
manufactured in but I I don't I
don't hate the fact that we looked into
it
as it turns out it was a huge waste of
time but probably had to do it
so yeah I'm I'm Pro uh I'm
pro-investigation of that one anyway
does anybody disagree
I honestly think that's pretty close to
the top of our national priorities
I don't think it's a I don't think it's
a revenge and I don't think it's purely
political
it has those elements but I don't think
that's why you do it
I really want to know it's very
important to me
all right
um
apparently this FDX thing just continues
to be the gift that keeps on giving now
we learned that FDX didn't only fund
Democrats
they were one of the you're naive
the old Tom 2 Harris that tells me I'm
naive
Tom apparently you must be new to this
channel
because
I won't want I don't want to use the c
word on you because we're having such a
nice time here
but you know what you are
you're the c word
all right
so FDX not only major funded majorly
funded the Democrats
um but they also funded McCarthy
and some anti-maga candidates
so apparently it was a anti-trump
movement even more than it was a
Democrat movement
because remember FDX had Trump lose as a
an item on their balance sheet
and they weren't just funding Democrats
they were funding what they believed
would be you know normal Republicans who
were anti-jump
so it gets more interesting as we go
some say it was the uni party
um do you remember Forbes the magazine
back when magazines were a thing well
they still exist in some form uh I guess
the magazine still exists but at least
online and
here's something they actually said they
they printed
um
or a story a major story about the FTX
CEO of Alameda which was associated with
FTX and
was part of the whole scam and she was
the girlfriend 20 year old girlfriend of
Sam bankman
so Forbes does a major piece about the
girlfriend of Sam dankman and
here's the headline
they call Forbes calls the FDX
girlfriend person a darling of the
alt-right
a darling of the alt-right
this is Forbes
Forbes
what
and here's how they supported it
apparently there's one person who's on
the alt-right
who is saying that that the problems
weren't so much her fault but maybe the
prior
leadership or something
and that's it
that that was enough
for Forbes to ruin a headline that she's
a darling of the alright
because there's one guy who thinks that
some of the details of the story are
wrong and that she might be getting
blamed for something that could have
been some other guy's fault
that's it
I don't think there was anything I don't
remember I didn't read every word of it
but I don't think the story even
mentioned that they fund Democrats
what's going on here
this is Forbes
I I don't even understand that
I mean it's it's the this is the depths
of unethical journalism
there's nothing you could say about this
but this is just deeply unethical
and I hate to say that because I I like
the Forbes family and I like the
publication
what's going on here I
do you even understand
like why would they even do that
it's a misprint no it's not a misprint
all right all right that's just an open
question I don't know what the hell is
going on there
um well call me an optimist
because I'm feeling quite optimistic
today
but I love me some free markets anybody
else like free markets of course you do
we like competition too it seems like
wherever there's competition something
good comes out of it
but look at all the things that are on
the let's say on the correction path so
these are things that are still bad
but they seem to be on the correction
path
because of competition
all right and if you don't see them all
together
your your brain can miss how good things
are going right now right so these are
all things that are currently being
fixed by competition but are not fixed
yet so these These are still broken
things but they're clearly on the way to
being fixed school choice
right Corey D'Angelo big credit for that
but school choice is clearly growing
and that's competition for schools so
nothing's fixed yet but that's the
that's the path right so we're going the
right direction
and it's you know improving at the same
time I mentioned the ESG has competition
now with this drive funds free market
allowed somebody to create a fund that
competes with it that's all I wanted
that's all I wanted if it turns out that
the ESG funds outperform
the non-esg funds
okay I'll just say I was wrong and then
I will then I'll go invest the money in
some ESG funds they'll say oh well I was
really wrong about that but I'm sure
glad I know where to put my money now
so however it turns out however it turns
out
competition moved us forward we would
become smarter how about uh Twitter fact
checking the fake news
perfect
Twitter is the competition for the
mainstream news and it's actually a fair
fight now for the first time
and the funny thing is that Elon Musk is
a Democrat who's just sick of their
musk is not alt-right or right or
conservative he's not Republican
he is a pure Democrat who is sick of
their
he was just embarrassed to be associated
with him that's what it looks like I
can't read his mind but it looks like he
was just embarrassed to be associated
with such and so that
temporarily he's you know he's doing his
own thing until he can fix them and one
of the things that whether ways he can
fix the Democrats is called now
they're and make him compete
on policy
what happens if fake news
uh is mortally wounded by musk because I
think he has
if you if you haven't noticed it yet you
will
I believe fake news has been mortally
wounded and and the big gaslighting
stuff the stuff like we've never seen
before you know Russia collusion I mean
that was a whole other level wasn't it I
think I think Twitter will just erase
all that stuff they'll still be
but it's gonna be in the Weeds now it's
not going to be a major national you
know hallucination
so competition for fake news and you
know we see CNN uh normalizing toward
the middle that's also competition
against the fake news we see uh we're
trying to pull business out of China
that's the right kind of competition we
see that Congress is deadlocked
Congress is deadlocked competition
the only way Congress Congress can get
anything done now
is by not being
hey the the public just narrowed their
path to all right before you wanted to
spend all of your time being
because it worked you could still get
your thing passed because you had the
majority now you can't be now you can't
be a there's this little
narrow path of reasonableness that if
you want to get anything done you're
going to have to find that narrow path
and there's going to be some people from
the other side who are on it
perfect
how about the fact that nuclear is now
no longer the worst thing in the world
and is competing with solar
perfect
I don't want the world to be only solar
I don't want the world to be only
windmills are only nuclear I want them
to fight it out
we're there again we're in a bad place
but we're we're clearly using
competition now for the first time
because remember before nuclear got its
reputation fixed Michael schellenberger
thank you before it fixed its reputation
it wasn't competitive now it is so when
you start looking at everything that's
wrong
you start noticing wow there's a
competing there's like a thing forming
that's an offset it's not there yet but
it's clearly forming
so
I'll tell you there's one thing that
America gets right
and it's this
the one thing America gets right
consistently
is free markets now we we put our little
laws on them and we get them wrong
temporarily but we do correct we do
correct and you're seeing it massive a
massive correction going on in America
so it's going to look like chaos
it'll look like chaos for a while it's
going to look like everything's broken
for a while
because it is you have to you have to
basically you have you have to eat your
baby to have more babies it's just the
way the world works
and so
uh and now here's one that will just
blow your mind I saw speaker McCarthy
say directly in public
that we need more immigration not less
did any of you catch that
Republican leader of the House
said in public
loudly and without any without any kind
of uh qualifier we need more more
immigration
how many of you agree that we need more
immigration
this is very interesting yeah everybody
I saw on Twitter said yes
the ones who said no
all right speaking to the ones who say
no
I'm not going to persuade you I'm going
to inform you
okay
so the so I'm just going to give you
information that is clear you don't have
it goes like this
uh if we don't increase our population
all the time the the economy fails
did you know that so the people are
saying no to more immigration did you
know
that there isn't any way to support the
economy without it now the alternative
which you might be thinking is but wait
but wait the people who are already here
would just have more babies and we
should do that too
but do you know why Americans don't have
more babies
I don't think it's fixable
the reason Americans don't have more
babies is that we're too selfish
we're too selfish
that's it
if a if an immigrant comes over here
with absolutely nothing
they'll still have a baby
they'll still have a baby even if they
have nothing
because they'll share their nothing with
the baby
but an American will say uh if I had a
baby
I couldn't go out tonight
couldn't couldn't have my career it's
going to change how I look
I'm gonna be like locked down with some
guy I don't like after five years ends
up in divorce I don't want any of that
right
now it's the culture stupid is correct
American culture
is anti-baby
would you agree
it's anti-baby because the way our
economics and our social structure is we
want both the mother and the father
working because they both have to work
if the mother and father are both
working the pressure on having kids is
just extreme extreme not to have them or
to have two
or one
and call it good
but the the people who want to have six
babies you know that tends to be
billionaires and some people who are you
know conservative
or people don't use birth control I
guess
but let me say this as clearly as
possible and and for those of you who
think we don't need more population well
let me let me
let me back off
forgetting about how the population
grows either from our own babies or from
the outside
can I sell you all I want to see if I
can get every person to agree
that all economists agree all of them
both sides every Economist agrees your
population needs to be increasing
for your economy to be healthy
okay can you give me a yes on that
I don't believe there's any Economist
who disagrees with that now we can we
can talk separately about where the
people come from it's a separate
decision right
some are saying no
okay if you say no you don't have any
uh any experience with economics and I
would ask you to go talk to somebody who
does
nobody no country has ever succeeded
with a shrinking population have they
not not if they want to be what the
superpower
I mean I can imagine I could imagine a
small country let's say they use tourism
you know or let's say a special case the
Middle East could a middle east oil
country
have low uh low population growth and
still do fine
probably
because they would have like oil would
be their entire economy so you could
have a special case
there can be a special case
Japan I would argue is uh is in bad bad
shape because they're demographics I
don't think I don't think Japan as well
as they're doing in Japan's solid
remember Japan used to be ruling the
economic boom in when the 60s and 70s
but now they're not now they're just a
metoo kind of a company
our country
yeah India is huge and in poverty
but India's economy is growing like
crazy which solves it which will solve
their poverty
yeah so I I guess I'll give you that
there could be a special case where uh a
shrinking or a stable economy or stable
number of people doesn't hurt you but
America is not the special case America
is a case where our economic power is
because of the number of people
suppose we had stopped immigration when
there were you know only 10 million
people in the country
we wouldn't be the United States right
you know immigration is what made us
you know in part Who We Are
so here's the real mind Bender here it
comes
Trump
could
say we need more people
that would just everything up
if he said we need more people
we just have to have tight border
security to make sure we're the
criminals are not coming over that's
very much what he's already said
because I don't know that he's ever said
we need fewer citizens has he
has Trump ever said we need fewer humans
who are in America or is he only said it
has to be legal
he's he's in a perfect position
where it can reverse everything they
said about him by saying we need more
brown people coming across the border
and by the way more of everything more
Africans you know more Nigerians more
be more non-shith whole countries
you can just say we need a ball
yeah we but we need the right ones we
don't need every Nigerian
we want their good ones
right now
some of you are saying he has said that
not well and not in a situation where we
can say unambiguously our birth rate is
too low
I've never heard Trump say our birth
rate is low we need more people
he's never said that but that's what
McCarthy did
so McCarthy this is actually a service
to the country so McCarthy did a service
to the country
by floating this and taking the hit if
you don't like it
so let me give speaker McCarthy
a
kind of a big a big congratulations on
that it's not easy to say something like
that when you know your party is going
to have a reaction to it
especially brand new on the job right
well you don't like okay maybe you don't
like McCarthy for other reasons I'm not
arguing the other reasons I'm just going
to say this was good government
good government because he said what you
don't expect a republican to say he was
right in terms of economics
and he had a plan
he had a plan a very specific plan you
know fixed border security we know how
to do that
and tighten up our vetting but still let
in more people
that's as good as you can get all right
I'll I'm sure I'll criticize McCarthy
later for some other thing he does right
but I'm going to give him this
as an A plus
this was an A plus for the country I
don't think it helped him I think he
helped the country
um
how weird is it
or coincidental or is it telling us
something that in my opinion the two
most talented politicians in the world
at the moment are both women
you know I always complain when we say
it's the first woman to do whatever job
or the first black person elected to
whatever because I think aren't we past
that
like what like why where's the news
value of the first black American who is
doing some job or gets elected like
where's the news value of that they used
to be but but if there's somebody who
thinks that like black people can't work
or something you can't get jobs
like that would be surprising but
shouldn't we just sort of incorporate
that into the Baseline now
you know shouldn't it be just the
Baseline that good people of all types
get jobs
doesn't matter who you are if you're
good at it you can get the job
all right but
this one really catches my eye because
Italy's Milani and Kerry Laker who I'm
talking about
if you didn't know you probably already
knew
but I was I saw a video of uh Italy's
Milani their new new head of the country
uh just ripping Francis macron into
little pieces
and I don't even speak the language so
I'm just reading the the subtitles and
I don't think I've ever seen stronger
persuasion it was visual it was you know
she had exactly the right
emotional
um build like she started out factual
she made her case and then she just like
took it up a notch and like oh my God
you can't do that better
Carrie Lake
she's the best American politician in my
in my opinion
would anybody disagree
who would you put above her just in
skill level right now is there anybody
above her in skill level because I think
Trump's a close second
but he's second right now
I think so I think she's the best one
um
and I believe that Kerry Lake was
reportedly visiting Mar-A-Lago
huh
I wonder if that means anything
now it doesn't necessarily mean vice
president pick
but uh they're both smart enough to know
that it's going to get us talking about
it
you know I'm sure they knew that the
news would get out if they didn't leak
it themselves they may have leaked it
themselves
but
uh
she hasn't conceived it is that true
yeah so I think that Trump might have a
strong play there and like I said before
the the thing about Carrie Lake that's
different different than Pence and
different than other people is I believe
Trump would appreciate her skill
and when he appreciates somebody's skill
he can work with them easily
right it's the people he doesn't respect
that you know he's going to fire or be
an about
so it could be a really strong team you
never know
all right uh and that ladies and
gentlemen
is the best live stream you've ever seen
today
and is there any topic I missed
cbdc what's that mean
I don't know what that means
what is cbdc
oh digital essential Bank digital
currency
so
let's say the government has a digital
currency and the point of it is that
they can control the citizens better
because that's one of the things that
happens right
um
here's here's the problem
it's going to happen anyway
it doesn't matter what their intentions
are
we're going to have digital money
does anybody disagree with that do you
see us a hundred years from now reaching
in your pocket to take out a piece of
paper to pay for something
right that so
so while we don't like the fact that the
government could have this extra control
of us
it's going to happen
so do you debate things that are just
going to happen
like I don't debate whether oxygen is
good or bad
it's just going to happen
it's just there so I don't know if
that's even a debate you you could say
my God you know it gives the government
power we don't want them to have but
I'd say they already have it
so I heard somebody say that the
government could then just turn off your
um your ability to buy things
they can do that now the government can
turn off your can turn off your
financial life anytime they want
right
yeah well try to use cash but you know
you end up in the criminal underbelly
world you're going to pay your mortgage
with cash
I don't think so
yeah yeah you can't play with cash if
you have to write a check I mean because
we call writing a check is the same as
cash but if you don't have a bank you
can't even write a check so you can't
even use cash in that technical way
so the first thing you need to uh
recognize is that your your privacy has
been gone for a long time
you know that right
if you're arguing for privacy you're
living in the past the government has
access to everything
the only thing that keeps them from
accessing everything about you
is wanting to
all they have to do is want to
the digital digital money isn't going to
give them deeper control than they have
now
the government controls your body
your body
so no matter what kind of money you have
they can walk into your house and put
handcuffs on you take you away and kill
you
legally you know depending on what you
did you'd have to do a capital crime but
the government controls your body
that you're worried about them
controlling your access to your money
which they already totally control
I feel like some of this is
psychological
um
now if if now don't get me wrong don't
get me wrong I don't want the government
to have that kind of control over me
but I also live in the real world where
they already do they already do
I know it just seems like if if the
digital currency gives me any advantages
like convenience and I don't have to
touch like dirty money I don't like
touching money
if it gives me that and my and the
control the government has over me is
still a hundred percent like it is now
so you're saying that uh you know they
could make you get vaccinated or turn
off your money
they can do that now
they can do it right now
all they have to do is go to the banks
and say Here's a list of people that you
can't bank with
right
so sometimes sometimes you think there's
something to argue about but there isn't
you can't argue about something that's
going to happen anyway and you can't
argue about something that won't be any
worse than the current situation
but it feels worse it definitely feels
worse
like if you know if I could stop it I
would
but I don't know if I want to
control of money is control of the
population got it they already have that
do you not understand they already have
total control
they already have it that you're talking
about 20 years ago
20 years ago or maybe not even 20. but
there was a time when maybe it didn't
even need a checking account
you know didn't even need a credit card
but that's not today the banks and
remember the banks can't refuse the
government
right
if your bank can unbank you then The
Government Can unbank you because the
government can control the banks by
saying you know you need certain access
to things that we only have and we'll
take away your
uh whatever authorization you have to be
a bank we'll just take it away so they
have all full control that that minor
bit of convenience where they can just
push one button
I don't know if that makes much
difference
and by the way what would happen if it
happened once
naive
yeah the naive people are just pure NPCs
they're starting to get funny
Ali Alexander got all of his finances
shut off Andrew Tate got all of his
finances shut off Andrew Tate said he
has to I don't know if this is true but
it's a great it's just a great story he
says he has to fly his uh is like super
expensive sports car in his in a jet
wherever he goes because he can't use
Uber Uber won't Uber won't let him his
Bugatti
now I don't know if any of that is true
but I love the fact that he said it
right I love the fact that he said it
hahaha
Joe says Scott is priming us for the wef
great reset
Joe Joe
just because I tell you you're already
 doesn't mean I you
right
there's a difference
if I find you on the street with a
all in the middle of your forehead
I'm just a guy who found you
I'm not the white I want to put the
hole in your forehead
um
laughs
damn I'm keeping quiet
all right I'm going to turn off uh
the
um
locals I'm gonna I'm gonna get rid of
the unsubscribers now so I can talk to
the locals after
and uh I'm gonna say goodbye to YouTube
now I'll be talking to locals privately
subscribers only and bye for now Spotify
too
