well I don't know if anybody's watching
because I think there's a little buffer
issue and I'm told that when I first
turn on nobody's actually
watching but yet I get comments which is
weird all right well I'm going to stall
a little bit for the rest of the
platforms to come in and I'm going to
print my
notes and watch me move slowly so that
everybody can get in here and we'll all
be together together once I have my
notes
wow that's a lot of
[Music]
notes
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and I'm
pretty sure you've never had a better
time if you'd like to take this
experience up to levels then nobody can
really understand it's beyond the
ability of the human brain to process it
all you need for that is a cup or mug or
a glass a tankered sheler Stein a
canteen Jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid I
like coffee en join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine the
day thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and
happening now
go one of the
best well boy do we have a good good
show for you
today I wish I were you just so I could
watch this show so
good well NBC News has uh come to the
startling um Discovery thanks to some
new research that getting angry can help
people overcome
challenges huh who ever knew that
getting angry could motivate
you
everybody how about let's do some
research on something that literally
every single human being already knows
pretty much
birth do you know what an angry little
baby gets more stuff turns out that
being angry is very
motivating I dare say it's a secret to
my
success I don't know about the rest of
you but nothing motivates me more than
being
angry
nothing it's the number one motivator
it's like oh my God I'm going to I'm
going to have to chew my way through
that wall I'm so angry well angry makes
you motivated but what else affects you
well it turns out that being replaced by
robots in your place of work can make
workers have a sense of meaningfulness
they lose their meaningfulness and
autonomy and it makes them sad
so if you're if you're forced to work
with robots it'll make you sad because
you won't have any meaning do you know
what you can do to overcome your feeling
of sadness and lack of motivation
because you're
robots get mad at the
robots it'll bring back your sense of
agency you get things done yeah so you
can conquer your sadness with something
I call getting really angry over
nothing if you've never tried it is way
better than it
sounds seriously do you ever have a day
when you're just feeling
sad and nothing will cheer you up but
then something comes along that makes
you angry and you're like what
angry is better than
sad it's way better I got more energy so
yeah next time you're sad get mad it's a
great idea there's a uh company called
uh Helix
Technologies in South southeast Asia
they're uh already taking reservations
for a some kind of a subscription
vehicle an electronic vehicle so
electric car that um you could could
rent for 25 cents an hour which would
come out to something like $6 a day
including everything from maintenance to
insurance and you don't have to buy
anything and you don't have to fix
anything is that a big idea do you think
do you think that renting a subscription
vehicle way way cheaper and no work
whatsoever you don't have to bring you
don't have to put gas in it you know
presumably you just pick it up when it's
already charged and use it till you give
it
back well I don't know sounds good if
it's way cheaper on the other hand
wouldn't you rather have self-driving
cars have have you thought about what
the world would be like with fully
autonomous cars where you really don't
have to pay
attention the first thing you do is you
change the interior of the cab so the
cab should just be sort of circular
couch or something like that or maybe
even a couch where you can actually just
take a on a couch I want an electric car
that knows how to find a charging
station and the only thing I do is put
in the
destination I would replace all airline
travel and all my vacation plans with an
electric car just one electric car as
long as it did its own driving its own
refilling and uh and it could talk to me
now imagine also that your fully
self-driving car has
AI like rock and it can talk to you
while you're driving and you just tell
it what you want say hey uh grock um can
you look for a good restaurant what kind
of restaurant would you like I don't
know something with this kind of food or
that kind of food and grock will say
well I found three which one sounds good
oh go to that one I want to be able to
walk outside sit in my car with no
steering wheel no responsibility
be able to work on my laptop take a nap
or have a conversation with grock and
learn something and next thing I know
I'm in another town and it's like a cool
town and I can hang out there and if I
want to go visit anything I'll say hey
hey grock can you take me to are there
any museums or any place I should visit
and it just figures out your whole uh
your whole thing and just you know finds
your a public restroom all that St
that's when I'll be traveling I'm going
to be uh older than Joe Biden and just
sitting back in that self-driving car
saying ah I've never seen Ohio take me
to
Ohio well here's a uh possible
validation of a uh prediction I made uh
in the 90s when I wrote my book The
Dilbert future now you've heard me say
this before but what you haven't heard
me say is that it's here th this is the
least the least likely
prediction that was ever likely to
happen you ready my prediction was that
there would be cameras inside the home
and inside every enclosed space except
maybe bathrooms and that they would
always be
on uh except they would be
encrypted so nobody would ever be able
to see it maybe even including yourself
in your own home unless it was a court
order to unencrypt it
now did that sound like a uh thing that
might actually happen in the '90s I
predicted in the 90s based on the cost
of cameras continuing to
drop so here's what's new there is a
technology that will encrypt um all the
cameras in your house let's say on
robots if you have a robot in your house
and you're going to have a robot in your
house the robot's going to have a
camera and it's going to be connected to
the internet
and you're going to say to yourself I
don't want somebody having a cord order
and you know maybe looking through my
video so now they have a technology
where the the robots video would be
stored not as video but rather as
something that only a computer could
understand and apparently can't be
reverse engineered or at least not yet
so so you can't reverse it and figure
out what the the robot saw so the robot
will be able to do its thing just based
on patterns so it doesn't it's not
seeing like a person it's just using
patterns to do its thing so in
effect if you've got robots and more
digital devices in your house it's
possible that everything will be
recorded all the time it will just be
encrypted and then there will be some
chord order or something where somebody
will say well somebody got murdered so
we better find out what the robots saw
now it could be that you'll never be
able to see it but maybe you could query
the robot as in okay robot I know we
can't play back your video to see the
murder but tell us in your own words
what you saw well I was in the living
room and I heard
shots so get a robot better than a guard
dog you know if the if the bad guys
shoot your guard
dog you know the guard dog can't talk
but if they shoot your robot you know
let's say the robot sees you doing a
crime and you shoot the robot the robot
may have already downloaded its data it
might be the shooting the robot can't
help you because it already downloaded
its
data so that's coming and crypted Video
in your
house um are you following the story of
Grace price I think she's 18 years old
and has some kind of a maybe a book but
she's got a big message about food being
poison and that our current food supply
is basically killing us so she made it
all the way to Jesse water show and on
Fox News and she's making quite a dent
here and she's talking about
specifically uh not getting teens
addicted to sugar and that there'll be
more cancers Etc well I think she's
right I think she's absolutely right now
I point this out because does it feel to
you that this um push back on the food
supply is getting
bigger I'm having trouble deciding what
are real real Trends and what are just
things I'm being exposed to by social
media you know because sometimes you you
get fooled into thinking it's a big deal
when it's not at all but I see more and
more serious people and Grace is one of
them uh RFK junior is another uh I'm
another I think we're all serious people
and we're all saying hey hey
there's something really really wrong
with the food supply like seriously
wrong with it like way not like the the
old days wrong at a level that's the
biggest scandal in American history
maybe bigger than World War II maybe
bigger than anything we've ever seen it
could be the biggest scandal in American
history the food supply because it
affects
everybody so I think that that trend is
going to grow because I can't imagine it
shrinking
so maybe that's another case where
populism is
necessary why does the world need
populism populism defined by something
like the public getting what it's asking
for well I think it's obvious
governments do not serve
people and I'm I'm working toward the
theme of the day starting with some fun
stories but there's a theme coming I'll
get to
it all right um there's a new study says
that there various kinds of placebos and
some placebos work better than others
for
example um this is a
study came out of somewhere anyway if
your Placebo is a certain
color it might work better than another
color in other words if the pill is blue
people think oh that'll help me relax
but if you gave somebody a red colored
pill you know we're not talking red pill
stuff here but just a red colored pill
their brain might not say well red pill
isn't going to make me
relax now for some people taking a blue
pill is definitely not going to relax
them if you know what I mean am I right
yeah but you get the idea that if you're
more impressed with the the physical uh
pill it works better now also if they
tell you that the pill cost more it
works better so if they say hey take
this pill it costs $100 and it'll fix
your whatever it won't work nearly as
well as if they tell you ah this is such
a good pill $1,500 for one pill then
people will get much better because they
paid $1,500 for a pill now here's the
payoff you're probably not super
surprised at any of that are you since
the placebo is a psychological effect
they say doesn't surprise you that if
you add a little juice to the psychology
of the situation you get a better effect
well I'm going to add this to the
category of science that I call should
have asked
Scott what year did I first know that
the equality of the placebo would make a
difference oh
1981 because I learned it in hypnosis
class it's basic it it's one of the most
basic elements of hypnosis if you're a
hypnotist and you want to hypnotize
somebody and you want them to
really you know easily fall into the
experience you make sure you've got a
diploma on your wall ideally more than
one and by the way this works for
doctors and psychologists as well the
reason that doctors put their diploma on
the wall is that it makes you
healthier isn't that funny if you see a
a serious looking diploma or let's say
more than one on a doctor's wall you
will get healthier faster and not
because they have good credentials it's
because you talk to yourself into it the
police SEO effect so doctors know that
the the reason the doctors wear the the
white
outfits they don't have to like there
there's no law that says doctor has to
have like a stethoscope in their PL
pocket and you know nice shoes and all
that it's it's all part of the placebo
effect yeah it's it's part of making it
all work and it's a good idea same with
your lawyer are you going to trust your
lawyer as much if they show up in blue
jeans best lawyer in the world but they
show up in blue jeans
nope nope you will not you unless there
were some famous character or something
you wouldn't no you want to see the suit
because the suit does make a difference
now we learned that in hypnosis because
if you're a hypnotist and you've got a
nice office people will go right into a
trance if you're just a a
friend and you're like hey I hear your
hypnotist not nearly as effective you
need the whole show it's part of it's
part of the psychology of
it but I'd like to offer at least one
more possibility maybe there's no such
thing to the psychology of placebos or
doctors or hypnotists what
if it's more proof that you can author
your own experience in the
simulation what if your belief that
something is true doesn't just change
the psychology which changes your body
which changes is maybe your ability to
get better that's the way we've always
thought of it what if you're actually
just authoring
it what if believing you're going to get
better actually just changes reality
directly and not because your mind
changed your body your body fought off
the disease or something what if it just
directly changes
reality and the reason I say what if is
I think that's exactly what's
happening now I I and what I mean is
that I do think we're directly affecting
our reality by our thoughts if that
explains placebos I don't know I won't
take it that far but I'd like to at
least put it out there that it might not
be a psychological effect at all it
could be uh one more in a long list of
evidence that we're a simulation a
simulated reality and that we change it
with our
thoughts so there's that all right
here's another thing I'm going to call a
trend even if it isn't it might be a
fake trend but it sure feels real here's
a story of a Subway Hero who uh went
into a Subway sandwich place and uh
there was some customer who was beating
up the
cashier and it was a high school
wrestler and the high school wrestler
took down the per and waited until the
authorities got there so he's being
called a hero and he got some free
Subway sandwiches and stuff like
that do you think
that men and I'm sorry ladies this is
only for the men do you think that men
have given up not giv up that's the
wrong word do you think they've had
enough that's the opposite of giving up
so what I mean is the opposite of giving
up do you think they've had enough do
you think the men are just going to go
Daniel Penny no matter what happens
here's what I think is happening the
Daniel Penny thing has two
effects the short-term effect is oh
I'm not going to do that look what
happened to Daniel Penny right you all
felt it I bet every man felt that
short-term effect shortterm whoa I
better not save
anybody now what's the long-term
effect well you're going to see the
long-term effect all over the news today
here's the long-term
effect wrestler in Subway knows the
Daniel Penny
story but he's had enough takes him down
anyway that's called being a
man that's what that is he's just being
a man and we're not allowed to be
men civilization said you can't be a man
in fact if you're a man you suck you're
the problem you're the
colonizer men women can do everything
better go girls go ladies there's
nothing they can't do and I think men
just
said
everything we're just going to be
men because I don't think you can stop
men in the long run there there's a male
energy you can slap it you can suppress
it but that energy doesn't go
nowhere that that energy is going
somewhere and you you put a little
Daniel P suppression on men it'll work
for a little while but when we get out
of that little trap we're going to be
pissed and did I tell you that being mad
is
motivating men are
mad we're not just watching
anymore now we're mad do you
know what got me canceled was it what I
said
somewhat no it's because I said I've got
enough I'm done
you can't do anything to me you cannot
suppress whatever energy that I produce
it's going to come out you're
not going to like it I'm going to do it
anyway because I'm a man it's what I
do I I'll give you a little
flexibility until I
don't that's how it works you want some
flexibility I'll give it to you you want
me to back down happy to do it
want me to be um a little back up a
little bit so you can have a little more
space happy to do it until you push me
too far and then there's nothing I won't
do there's nothing I won't
do let me say that again if you push me
too far there is literally nothing I
won't do if you push me too
far so you're seeing me in my push too
far
mode which is why I'm willing to say
absolutely anything in public
cuz I'm
done I'm done I'm done getting pushed
you want to put me in jail do you think
I don't risk going to jail when I do
this you know I do right you're all
aware of that I'll talk I'll talk about
the news in a little bit but you know
Scotland is putting people in jail for
talking Brazil's getting ready of your
free speech we'll talk about this
Trump's going to jail for
nothing the January 6 people locked up
for nothing yeah I'm risking
going to jail and you know what
everybody
everybody I'm
done I'm done
playing there's nothing you can do to
me and this Subway
Hero maybe he was done
too and maybe that's the
story men are done do you know why I can
say that the problem with the world is
bad sh crazy liberal women cuz
I'm done do you know why I wouldn't have
said that in the past cuz I wanted to
get
laid if I could never get laate again
but I can tell you what I really think
good I'm ready there's nothing you can
do to me I don't there's nothing you can
do to
me nope bat crazy women are
ruining the goddamn country there you go
cancel
me
all right
um but as you know women are better than
men at everything according to the New
York Post there's a new study uh that
says that uh men don't give women
orgasms as well as women give other
women orgasms yes there's not a
thing in the world that women can do
that isn't better than everything men
can
do and there's another study that says
that the country having the most sex is
turkey the Turks are having the most sex
they're the most promiscuous uh the
average Turk has slept with more than 14
people wow they don't specify how many
of them are same sex versus different
sex and I have
questions hey average Turk how many
partners have you had well are we
counting just human all right let's
limit it to human well are we counting
both Sexes I guess so it's
2024
14 um how about the other
countries well it turns out United
States isn't too high on that list uh
we're we're in 13th Place of all the
people are having lots of Partners I'm
not sure we should be happy about being
at the
top not necessarily your best
situation but uh and but where they have
having the most well Australia came in
second place so the Australians have uh
13 Partners on
average um so if you want to have more
sex and you're an American do you know
what you can do you can go down
under thank you I'll take a
sip yeah
yep you know earlier before the show I
had
during the pre-show that only the local
subscribers
see there was a gentleman who said he
used to be a
beekeeper and I challenged him I said
you used to be a
beekeeper
so you didn't really keep the bees did
you cuz you quit you're no longer
keeping the
bees he was he wasn't so much a keeper
of bees he was a person who let the bees
leave or he left the bees
that's not a
beekeeper even though you thought you
were a beekeeper you were only
temporarily with the bees you weren't
keeping them anywhere you left you know
why you are now you're a
beever you're not a keeper you're a
lever so I I think he became a
minister because when he was no longer a
beekeeper he was a
Believer thank you Dad jokes all day
long all day long dad
jokes yeah you can take that with
you you can customize that any way you
like going down
under all
right meanwhile France uh is in 29th
position oh
France the one thing we loved about you
was that you were so Lusty and free with
your sex but it was all lie apparently
if you want to get frisky turkey or New
Zealand is where you want to
go Australia
good
good well some watch dogs have accused
the Biden administration of inflating
climate disaster
numbers well that oh that's a
surprise who who saw that
coming yeah let's details let's see uh
the
NOAA National
Oceanic Alcoholics Anonymous I think
that's what no OAA is yeah balloon the
cost of Damages for Hurricane idalia
never heard of it um in 2023 storm so
anyway they um apparently the Biden
Administration used an estimate for
storm damage that was just you know
stupid and out of context ridiculous and
they got called out for it
now here's where I think you should
count our blessings
all right just think about
this when the Biden Administration went
to to tell you the the storm damages
they were off by a factor of 10 because
they just lied to get what they wanted
so they just inflated by 10 now that
that tells you that that sort of number
can be maybe not as reliable as it
should
be possibly not 100% reliable but here's
the good news those climate models still
100% am I
right yeah everything that we audit
turns out to be crooked no matter where
it is or who audits it or what
organization it is
everything except the climate models and
the elections by the way and the
elections
lucky lucky the thing that's holding us
together is that our science is so
dependable especially especially when
they're predicting the future 80 years
from now boy are they good at that am I
right and also when they do
elections we nail those things
everything else seems a little sketchy
and I'll I'll admit that but those two
things
perfect every
time
yeah all right and this gets me to my
theme here's the theme everything that
didn't make sense to you was always the
CIA everything that would confused you
in the past or or currently as in why is
that not fixed or why did it happen that
way it's all the
CIA do you think I can make that case
well let me try Story number one uh
there's a u count on next called culture
critic it's a lot of fun and it tells us
a story of how Modern Art which was
developed in mostly in the United States
was a CIA
scop
what modern art now it might have
happened on its own but it turns out
that when Modern Art emerged as you know
a big thing it was at a time when the US
and the Soviet Union were sort of having
a culture war and we wanted to prove
that Americans could do art too and it
wasn't just all about this stodgy old
European stuff that maybe the Russians
were better at than us we're going to be
good at art oh yes we're so the CIA
started
promoting this Modern Art which too many
of us look like splotches on
canvas do you ever see a Jackson Pollock
painting and say to
yourself okay you know I I get that it's
interesting as sort of
a a pattern you know or something to put
on the wall I like the colors but it's
it art you probably said to yourself and
you probably did you ever find yourself
saying I don't understand this Modern
Art how in the world did this become
like like a you know million dooll piece
of art when it's a can of can of soup or
something didn't you always find that
confusing well here's the answer it was
never real and that's why you were
confused it w it was never organically
popular the CIA told you that splotches
on canvas were the best thing and you
should pay a million dollars for it and
then all the rich people went out and
bought it now do you think the CIA can
brainwash you they made you think that
Modern Art is
good they told you that Taylor Swift is
a great
musician I'm just kidding about that
Taylor Swift one I don't really get
Taylor Swift but I'm not really the
target market so I'm not going to mock
her obviously ly she Nails it for her
target market better than just about
anybody so I'll give her full credit for
being great at what she does but when I
look at her I go I don't get it I I have
no idea how that one person became so
famous nothing about that makes
sense
unless I'm I'm not saying that I have
any information about it but I look at
Modern Art and I look at Taylor
Swift and I look at Beyonce and I see
the same damn thing I have no idea why
Beyonce is popular and and even
yesterday I saw somebody who said they
went to one blew him away and Beyonce
was amazing and the show was great I
don't know I don't really get her at all
not at all so every time I see somebody
who's like a an American icon in the
Arts or even somebody who makes movies
you know anybody who's sort of at the
top of their game in some form of art I
now suspect is probably just a CIA
thing let me give you an
exception when I see a Tom Cruz movie I
say to myself damn that guy knows how to
make movies like he he Nails movies
better than anybody Nails movies lately
right so I don't automatically think
that's some kind of a CIA thing although
it could be I'm not ruling it out I'm
just saying if somebody has like obvious
Talent and I think Tom Cruz has just
immense talent for making movies then I
say well maybe that's just
organic but when I see you know Beyonce
or something that doesn't look organic
to me I I feel like there are a lot of
people who could do what she does I
don't know doesn't look special in any
way to me but I could also be just
terrible at judging things that's also
possible uh there's a uh interesting
example of AI working well uh Elon Musk
post posted one of his speeches about
you know aliens and going to other
planets and stuff and then he posted a
uh an edited version by
Ai and it completely changes the
experience imagine speeding up Elon mus
talking and getting rid of all the in
between ums and
pauses and it's just a completely
different thing and you know he he
posted it because apparently he liked it
too now I have the same problem don't I
how many of you play me at two times
Speed come on you know you do because
I'm a little bit slow at developing my
thoughts sometimes but so that
technology would probably be great for
me for the replay so as soon as that's
available I'll probably start running my
stuff through it so you'll have an
option where it's a little tighter a
little tighter so it's more than speed
they got rid of the gaps as
well but uh Elon is saying again that uh
he doesn't think that uh there are
necessarily any aliens we're going to
find and his argument is that it took
four and a half billion years for our
civilization to become you know sort of
like a real intelligent species and we
only developed writing in the last few
thousand years so and it took over four
billion years to get us to the point
where we could write so since the
universe is only about uh I don't two
and a half times that old there couldn't
be too many
civilizations especially because maybe
they don't last long once they're
created there can't be that many that
lasted all the way developed a
civilization and coincidentally are
still around so it's not that the
Universe never produced any other
civilizations is said that the odds that
they still be
here you know say 100 million years
later is pretty
small so he thinks that maybe that's
what's
happening so did you ever were you ever
confused why Elon Musk is sure that
there aren't any aliens uh who have
visited us
yet and he would know a lot about that
topic right I mean if if there didn't
been any real ones I'll bet he'd know
but yet the news keeps saying that you
know they're whistleblowers and we got
all these aliens how do you explain that
it's one of those confusing things that
doesn't make sense when you read the
news isn't it sort of like how did
Modern Art become
popular same
reason we have documentation that the
CIA has used fake CIA stories to divert
the public from news that they wanted to
divert it from do you think it's still
happening it looks like it it looks like
it's just still happening and it looks
like it's just ordinary CIA business to
say that there are UFOs so that we'll be
thinking about something else
yeah so probably the CIA explains Modern
Art it might explain some of our musical
people that in my opinion don't seem as
talented as their success suggests and
maybe the reason that people say they
are aliens is the CIA maybe now again
everything that I say that I attribute
to the CIA is just speculative to sort
of draw a big picture here doesn't mean
I know it you know so just Just go with
it so Trump had his record shattering
$50 million
fundraiser and uh he's bragging about
that so that's interesting what would
you call it what would you call Trump's
movement would you call it a populist
movement is the reason
that Trump is trying to be taken down
with lawfare because the CIA doesn't
want want him to be president to me it
seems like it again I don't know but
when you see what the uh intelligence
people did to fake the laptop as being a
Russian disinformation when you see what
our intelligence people did with the
Russian collusion HX when you see what
our intelligence people did in my
opinion the fine people hoax was an
intelligence hoax and in fact the whole
fine people the whole Charlottesville
thing was probably organized by
intelligence people they were real
racists but I don't think the real
racists do a good job of uh
organizing if you're like like a genuine
you know fine people hoax kind of racist
they tend to be not good organizers so
when you see them do something super
organized and they're all well-dressed
and they got khakis on and there's not a
single person who didn't get a
torch H it looks a little bit
intelligent
um organized and as we know our our
intelligence people do that in other
countries to overthrow them they do fake
fake protests like the BLM was fake and
antifa is fake if you didn't know
that were you confused by why BLM and
antifa disappeared as soon as Biden got
elected where you're like how does that
happen that's weird coincidence oh maybe
it's the same reason for Modern Art
maybe it's the same reason for alien
stories yeah maybe it's all the same
damn
thing meanwhile um the amuse
account uh reminds us that not reminds
us but tells us um I don't know if this
is
true but it's reported so I don't know
what level of credibility I'll give this
one I didn't see the
source um but the the idea is that
scientists and San Francisco have been
secretly spraying
Aeros aerosolized sodium chloride into
the atmosphere to reduce global
warming and that the Biden regime
approved it do you think that's true do
you think the Biden regime approved
climate change spraying stuff into the
atmosphere now I don't know but I will
tell you I live in the Bay Area so if
they were spraying San Francisco you
know maybe it would have some effect on
me and I can tell you as recently as
yesterday afternoon I was standing
outside and I was looking at the clouds
and I was saying I've never seen clouds
like this before in
California and in fact the day before
another Californian sent me a picture
because the clouds were unusual like
unusually robust and interesting looking
for California we don't have much in the
way of clouds California is either
overcast or sunny or there's like a
little wisp of a cloud
somewhere it doesn't look like the
Northeast but for the last week or so
it's looked like you know Upstate New
York like big storm clouds and you know
huge you know gray white shaded clouds
and so I don't know but I can tell you
it looks like it it I I literally before
I saw the story I was looking in the sky
and saying those clouds don't look
natural
so I
noticed you know so I can't say it's I
can't say it's a confirmation bias
because I noticed the clouds and had
really quite a lot of thought about it
before I knew there was a story that
could have caused it if it had gone the
other direction I'd say I was just
influenced by the story but the
realization came before The Story So
maybe can't say it for sure it just
looks like it
well the uh judge was rebuked over a uh
well let's talk about climate change do
you think climate change is
organic or or is it one of those stories
where you say how in the world did this
climate change become such a like Global
phenomenon how in the
world well I have a suggestion I have no
evidence for this the
CIA it could be that it's some major
program that allows the CIA to control
things it couldn't ordinarily
control maybe nothing but that it could
be that we know if the United States
doesn't you know do something with our
own energy situation that will be at
risk and you be will be beholden to
other
countries when you see that Russia is
one of the biggest producers of oil
and you see that the Middle East are
some of the biggest producers of
oil what would be the best thing that
the United States could do to to remain
dominant in the
world green
energy because if we build green energy
it takes away from Russia their only
advantage that they have lots of energy
see our only Advantage everything else
we do in the world seems to be
anti-russia why would this be different
every time we've got a you know
hypothesis about what's happening it's
Russia everything that happens is we got
to counter Russia we we keep producing
spies that are only experts on Russia
and every every uh conspiracy theory is
Russia but do you think this big old
climate change is the only thing that's
not about
Russia do you think it's coincidence
that if we fix the climate with all
these non oil assets do you think it's a
coincidence that it would also take
Russia completely out of the military
game because they couldn't fund their
thing and we know that Russia can't
match Us in terms of uh technical um
prowess so if we build a whole bunch of
technology that gives you energy instead
of just putting a hole in the ground and
making the oil come up well then maybe
Russia can't match us we we'll have the
kind of energy that everybody wants
will dominate the entire world by
selling them our let's say nukes and
solar power and stuff like that now of
course we didn't count on China
dominating the solar power industry but
I don't think we cared about that as
much as we cared that Russia didn't am I
right we we didn't care so much about
China having a big industry but we
really cared that Russia didn't now I'm
not saying that's a good idea I'm saying
that we we're we're always just Russia
Russia Russia in this country and uh
this would probably just be more of it
in my opinion the most likely scenario
for why climate change is such a big
deal and we can't let it go is that it's
a long-term play against
Russia now does it have other benefits
yes yes if we do it right we save the
the air we you maybe there's some even a
heat problem
by the way I I don't discard the fact
that we could be in trouble from CO2 I
don't discard that fact I just am not
convinced at
all because the S we don't have science
that's
dependable do we let me give you an
example um there's an example I just
gave you the example of the Watchdog so
the Watchdog group told the Biden
Administration
that they've been using a fake number
fake by a factor of 10 now let me ask
you this why did a watchdog group need
to tell the Biden Administration the
most important government for climate
change
anything why did they why did it have to
be a watchdog group because have you
heard of a another group at could have
been there's another group that could
have told them their number was wrong
what was that group climate
scientists climate scientist knew the
number was wrong didn't
they so are you telling me that the
entire industry of climate scientists
allowed Biden to say something that was
wrong by a factor of
10 and they all knew
it but they didn't speak up it took a
watch Door Group who is the opposite of
the scientists so the ones watching the
scientists so so why would you trust
anything that climate change scientists
say here's a very specific example where
the climate scientist looked at
something that clearly was wrong by a
factor of 10 and I'm sure some number of
them knew it and they shut the
up they were not willing to risk their
careers to question anything about
climate change there wasn't a single
thing they were willing to to question
so do you think you can believe they're
models of course not no they have no
credibility whatsoever if if they let
this go and they waited for a watchdog
group to catch it all credibility is
gone you know how I would have believed
climate change was real if the
scientists had corrected this the
 scientists if they had been the
ones to say wait wait wait we do believe
there's a problem but we're not cool
with the Biden Administration using a
madeup number he can't do that you know
we'd like to reserve some credibility
here so we got to stop you there nope
nope they just let it go needed a watch
Door Group to stop it that's the only
reason you even know about it you don't
know about it because the
scientists they were worthless
absolutely worthless but you
think next time they'll be helpful right
so the next time you're going to say oh
they're probably right this time no they
have no credibility use use the legal
standard if somebody lies to you
once this is usually what courts will
tell the uh the jury if the defendant
lies to you want wants or the witness
does you're allowed to assume that
anything else they say is not
necessarily
believable and that's the same with the
scientists if they lie to you this
obviously and aggressively and right in
your face and they don't correct and
acknowledge how wrong they've been
forever you can't trust the next thing
they say that would be crazy in the real
world you don't trust anybody who acts
like
that you know doesn't matter if they
have a big science Jack it
on all right so the there was a judge
that was
rebuked over some January 6 St and the
same judge had made a CNN appearance
mocking Trump so imagine a sitting drug
judge coming on CNN just to talk
about President Trump already everything
about that is wrong retired judge okay
sitting
judge no no no no no
no well this same
judge um was found by another Court to
have plainly ered in his actions he
because he ordered surveillance of a
defendant's
computer uh so this is a January 6
defendant and this judge ordered that
his computer could be surveilled to look
for
disinformation
what what what you're just going to
surveil this one guy for
forever what that is so wrong and that
and so that's so do you believe that the
justice
system is acting appropriately in its
lawfare against
Trump I don't I think it's the
CIA did you ever say to yourself I don't
understand how this all this could be
happening how in the world could there
be 91 indictments against an
ex-president how in the world there's
only one explanation it's the
CIA it's the same explanation for
everything you don't explain everything
you don't understand it's all the same
same
explanation yeah of course the CIA is
running the country of course they're
behind the lawfare of course they were
behind the fake laptop story of course
they were behind Russia collusion of
course they were behind the fine people
hoax of course they were behind the
George Floyd hoax
of
course all
right Leticia James speaking of
lawfare uh as you know Trump uh offered
a bond and had a company that was
willing to to do it and now Laticia
James has decided she's going to
investigate the company that was going
to issue the
bond do you think that's because that's
a perfectly reasonable thing for the law
to do no it's because this is blatant
iny face
lawfare why can people get away with
this lawfare right in your face because
somebody important is backing them like
Soros might fund her next
campaign Soros who works for oh yeah the
CIA right do you remember I told you I
don't understand why Soros is doing any
of this what these things make no sense
it's CIA he's basically their bank and
now it all makes sense why is the Border
open why are the drugs flowing across
why can't we close the border it's the
easiest thing in the world to do Trump
did it wouldn't be hard to do it again
why can't we close the border why are we
paying people to come here doesn't make
any sense CIA CIA is obviously working
with the cartels to control Central and
South America and they gain more by
using the cartels and so they let them
earn even at the expense of 50,000 lives
in America you know what I think the CIA
thinks about
fentanyl that it's just uh getting rid
of the
losers that's what I think I I think
that at the top levels of the country
unlike you and I who say my God we've
got to do something to stop all these
fenel deaths I think at the top they say
no you're just getting rid of people who
would been useless
anyway that's what I think I think that
at the top the people with real power
not Biden but people with real power I
think that they've decided they don't
want to fix that problem because it's
only getting rid of
losers they're not completely wrong
they're not all
losers but you can see the
point and does that explain everything
it does that would explain everything
yep by the way have you heard my theory
about who's running the country here's
my theory of who's running the country
you know everybody always says RFK Jr
said this directly that there's no way
Biden's in charge you ready for
this so if you are a dementia
patient and somebody's going to take
care of you and make decisions for you
who does
that always your family and always the
family that's closest to you usually
your spouse if your spouse is still
functioning it's always your spouse
what if it's not your
spouse probably a
child probably a child so whichever is
your most
functional closest to you
child is going to be your you know
person helping you make decisions if
there's somebody running Joe Biden do
you think it's somebody oh say in the
CIA not
directly but can you think of anybody
who's also a family member member who's
been implicated as a member of the
CIA yes Hunter
Biden also known as the smartest person
that Joe Biden
knows in my opinion Hunter Biden has
been running the country for some time
literally
literally now you could throw the
brother Jim in there too because it you
know could be a tag team but it does
seem to me that the people that Joe
Biden would listen to on a question such
as oh I don't know what should we do in
Ukraine do you think the Ukraine the
Ukraine war makes sense to you have you
said to yourself This Ukraine thing
doesn't make any sense why are we so
committed to giving our money to them
how does it make any sense well it might
make sense if you knew that the Atlantic
Council runs everything it's mostly xcia
which means CIA and if you knew that
barisma is part of the Atlanta
Council oh surprise huh and you knew
that Hunter was on the Atlant was H
Hunter was on barisma
board all make sense yet Ukraine was a
big moneya laundering CIA operation
there's no question about that Biden was
U Hunter Biden was a big part of barisma
which is tied in with the CIA so almost
certainly I will say certainly I think
this is one where you can say certainly
Hunter was protected by and working with
the
CIA and that that's why he's not being
punished and I would guess that Joe
Biden is completely aware of that and I
would guess that when Joe Biden's trying
to make a decision about
Ukraine that the opinion of his Joe
Biden's brother and
Son were basically you know deeply
embedded in the Ukraine situation and
probably the
CIA they're probably the ones running
the country so let me say it again all
indications are that Hunter Biden is
running the country for some of our
biggest questions he wouldn't be
involved in you know changes to the
budget in minor ways he would be
involved in the big
stuff the big
stuff uh I'm not joking by the way if
you look at any family dynamic as the as
the one family member's ability shrinks
the other family members take over and
it's always family members you know that
the the more out of touch Joe is the
more he's going to say the only people I
trust or you know somebody I married and
somebody who basically I produced and
it's just human nature you're not going
to trust that CIA officer who's got
something to say unless the CIA officer
talks to one of the B you know brother
or son and then they talk to Joe and
then Joe says all right Hunter you
looked into it you're the smartest guy I
know let's uh let's give some money to
Ukraine so there's another thing you
didn't understand who's running the
country and the answer is it's almost
certainly Hunter and maybe Jim and
almost certainly that means that the CIA
is behind
it um let's talk about the diddler P
Diddy I like calling him the diddler
because it sounds like the Riddler and
it sounds kind of cool but the diddler
uh Jesse Waters did a good job of
talking about that in the pbd broadcast
by the way Jesse Waters has a new book
I'll give him a little plug name of the
book is I don't know doesn't matter just
look for Jesse wat's new
book um in case you didn't know it's out
there and anyway
um and Jesse says quote we were told by
the former bodyguard that did was an FBI
informant so he was a snitch and maybe
worse than
Epstein do you think that the FBI
operates independently if if in fact
they were behind
this I don't think so because I think
the blackmail the blackmail world seems
a little too close to the
CIA because it's
International so I would think that if
the FBI is involved and if he was a FBI
perant which apparently even uh
um even Kanye made some reference to it
so which doesn't mean it's true but uh
there's
a a lot of information on it if the
former bodyguard says it's
true again that doesn't make it true but
the former
bodyguard former bodyguard probably
knows now Epstein we imagine had some
FBI connection but more than that we
assume he was more
more into the Spy world than the FBI
world you know some say worked for
Israel some say America some say both um
but if it turns out that uh the diddler
is bigger or worse than Jeffrey Epstein
which is what The Bodyguard seems to
think then uh maybe one of the things
you didn't understand about the world is
again
explained how could these people be out
of jail how could it be possible that P
didy could be running this major
operation for years years and didn't get
popped until
now maybe it's obvious maybe the CIA and
the
FBI well the Swiss are holding a
referendum to restrict population to 10
million until the year 20150 so
presumably this is an anti- migration
immigration move by the
Swiss uh Elon Musk quot uh commented on
that story by saying and I quote Europe
is
dying yeah yeah if if they don't grow
their
population all the way to
2050 there's something
wrong well meanwhile Brazil has uh
become a a hell
hole so here's what we know um so Brazil
is trying to limit free speech on the
xplatform and I think the other
platforms because they they have
a dictator likee leader now who doesn't
like populism and doesn't like free
speech and he's trying to force x to uh
block people that they don't want to be
seen basically political opponents they
want them blocked on X so that the
president isn't
criticized
Brazil in our
hemisphere Brazil
and they're not hiding it by the way
it's public they are publicly censoring
and reducing free speech so you know
what Elon Musk says when they said
you've got to censor all these people
just for Brazil Elon mus said you
uh lifted all
restrictions and he's going to take the
hit because they'll probably cancel X in
all of
Brazil what's that sound like to
you well I'll tell you what it sounds
like to me sounds like a wrestler in a
Subway shop who just
said I'm done there's nothing you can do
to me I've now
decided that you can't push me around
you canot have ax in Brazil but you
can't push me
around so mus just uh put the steak in
the ground said if uh if Brazil's going
to lose access to the platform that's
the way it's going but I'm not going to
B
man yeah male
energy the Daniel Penny thing wore
off can't hold us
back so they're moving toward a
dictatorship they technically have
elections but it doesn't look like the
elections will matter because if you get
rid of free speech the election will go
any way that the the bosses wanted to go
so I wouldn't I would say that they've
already lost um whatever democracy they
had now if you say to yourself my
goodness uh what happened to
Brazil very confusing right why would
Brazil just suddenly want to give up on
Free Speech feels like confusing huh
what would explain a confusing
Story the CIA well let's go to Mike Ben
what does Mike Ben say about this um
it's not Brazil doing this this is the
United States spies and blob as he calls
it it's it's basically how the United
States is trying to kill X and kill free
speech in America by using the other
countries that they can influence to
take down X as a viable economic entity
yeah this wasn't even a Brazil story now
Brazil wanted a two probably because
they can censor but the real story is
how do we get at
X and that uh Ben says that since
2019 um the Atlantic Council and their
cutouts have been moving toward this so
it's a major long-term operation to
control free speech in Brazil in part to
get it X and not only because it started
in 2019
there you go every everything that was
confusing well the AP has a story about
a quote Anonymous accounts and all the
terrible things they're doing dominating
right-wing discussions with those
Anonymous accounts getting everything
wrong and making people like Elon Musk
retweet things that are just wrong and
terrible and wrong the AP says so all
these Anonymous accounts who are they
talking about let me tell you which
Anonymous account they didn't want want
to mention you have to sort of look for
it you have to follow a link to find out
who they're talking about it's the end
wokeness account end wokeness how many
of you are familiar with that
account I quote them almost every
day almost every day I quote that
account now the accusation is that they
got something wrong that the account so
there was some story about uh
registering voters without IDs that the
AP says was wrong and that Elon Musk
boosted and I think I did too I'd have
to check but I'm pretty sure I reposted
that
now do you think that's a a a natural
organic
story that the AP was just looking
around said here's a story there's this
account that's
Anonymous and they got something wrong
something big but it was wrong they say
and Elon Musk boosted it so now make a
story out of that you think that
happened
maybe but it looks a little mysterious
to
me to me it seems like a lot of
attention for that one little
account does it seem like maybe the CIA
is trying to stop this little account
for ounting them for all manner of
Badness it
does it looks like they're a little too
interested in this little account it's
not so little actually it's doing great
and I think that the real story should
have been the community notes didn't
flag the account now that would have
been a real story I would have actually
appreciated that if they say there's
something wrong and then they further
tell me that the the mechanism for
catching it didn't work and I don't know
if it didn't work by the way it might
actually be Community noted by now but I
wasn't aware of it when I when I I think
I reposted it
um so that would be a story hey
Community notes is promising but it it
missed this one totally legitimate story
but to me it looks like a hit piece to
me it's a hit piece it looks like
somebody building a case to sensor to me
it looks like the CIA just like they
operate through third parties and
cutouts are just using the AP to tell
the story that maybe we should ban
Anonymous accounts do you know why
anonymous accounts even
exist
CIA they use anonymous accounts in other
countries so that the other countries
can be you know persuading against their
own governments but it might be our guys
so Anonymous accounts are how we control
other countries now here's this
Anonymous account that's taking their
control away so they had to send their
cutout I'm just calling it a cut out I
don't know that they're sending the AP
to take out this dangerous L entity
so there you
go
um
so Donald Trump has said that the judge
that's that's given him the gag orders
so he can't talk about uh the judge or
the judge's family Trump finally said uh
if this partisan hack wants to put me in
the clink meaning jail for speaking the
open and obvious truth which is about
the bias of the judge I think it is both
open and obvious I will gladly become a
modern day Nelson Mandela it will be my
great honor so Trump is saying he's
going to violate the court order and
they're going to have to put him in
jail Subway
wrestler Subway wrestler he just said
 it there's nothing you can do to
me do you know how much he doesn't want
to go to jail a lot a lot he doesn't
want to go to jail nobody wants that but
he just said it you're going to
have to put me in jail if you're going
to stop me from free speech on something
that's both true and obvious and
important it's true it's obvious and
important it's vitally important and you
going to take his Free Speech away
you put him in jail do you know what's
going to happen if he goes to the jail
the whole social structure is going to
fall apart and it needs to and I'm down
for that I'm down for that take it all
you want to call his bluff here's the
time call his bluff put him in jail for
one day see what happens yeah JK
rolling ring she said put me in jail try
it they backed
down Elan mus
says ban me in Brazil try it
wrestler
says you can't hit a cashier in front of
me I'm taking you
down Trump says you can't tell me I
don't have free speech in the United
States I'm running for president
put me in
jail
you Byron York is talking about uh
January 6
overcharging there's a case of a four
month sentence for a man
who well you've heard all the stories
you don't need the detail there's an
obvious overcharging of the January 6
people we all know that I could give you
another example of how terrible it is
you all know it you all know that this
is lawfare and you all know that the
reason they're putting people in jail is
to be a uh influence on future Behavior
free speech for example
so what do you think might happen about
that well do you know cash Patel who had
been in the previous administration
fairly well known among the people who
follow politics well people are
suggesting that he might be under
consideration to be the Attorney General
if Trump were to
win now that is really scary for
Democrats because he has said and MSNBC
has panicked about it he said that uh if
he if Trump uh ever got into power that
cash would be in favor of them going
after everybody who ran all these Ops
everybody who is behind trying to limit
Free Speech illegally and he includes
the media by name so he says yes we will
go after the media like the major
platforms and even the biggest hosts for
breaking the law and trying to I don't
know whatever whatever things he thinks
were broken or whatever Rico thing is
going on to me it looks like there's you
know clearly Rico cases for suppressing
elections now what would be my opinion
about using the legal system for
Revenge if you got
elected well my opinion before Daniel
peny was that's a terrible
idea right I I get people say oh you got
to fight back every way you can they're
doing it to us we got to do it to them
ah no I'm sorry you're you're just going
to make it worse if you if you act like
them you know what I think
today them put them all in jail put
every one of them in jail do I think
that that would destroy the Integrity of
the United
States don't
care that's where we're at we're at
don't care will it will it destroy the
Integrity of the you know Pol politics
and the justice system already
destroyed no if you take everything from
us guess what we got nothing to lose
nothing to lose there is nothing to lose
put them all in jail use the use the
Department of Justice put cash Patel in
front of the in the top position if he's
the one who's going to do it and
absolutely destroy the lives of as many
people as you can destroy their
lives I would never say that if the
system were working never but now Mutual
assured destruction you got to go to
jail you got to go to jail jail right no
 around you every member
in in fact I think Trump said that the
January 6 committee should be jailed did
you hear that I just saw that
today did he say that before I said
it because I've been saying it for a
while no joke it's very obvious that the
January 6 committee should be jailed you
don't think there's a crime there of
course there's a crime there probably
quite a few of them do you think they
withheld any exculpatory
evidence sure it looks like it yep sure
it looks like it yes yeah every every
member of the January 6 committee should
literally be in jail
and that's the only that's the only
outcome I'd be satisfied with honestly I
would be deeply unsatisfied if that
doesn't happen you can't the
country that hard and get away with
it at least not while we're still
alive so you're seeing a lot of male
energy Rising speaking of which El
Salvador na buelli you know he's put all
his criminals in jail which apparently
works putting all the criminals in jail
apparently works and he's got other
ideas he's got he's got a Bitcoin
economy and that's looking good but
here's some more uh male energy he just
announced that they're offering this is
El Salvador is offering 5,000 free
passports uh which are worth quite a bit
he says to highly skilled scientists
engineers doctors artists and
philosophers from abroad because 5,000
isn't many people so that's like 0.1% of
her population and he said despite the
small numbers of contributions will have
a huge impact on Society of course it
would scientists artists doctors and uh
he'll pay for the relocation give them
zero
taxes uh take care of their families
blah blah blah you know even they can
bring in their commercial equipment
intellectual property now what's wrong
with that
plan what's wrong with the
plan
nothing it's the smartest plan you've
ever seen why isn't the United States
doing this plan Let's see we were aware
of this idea because Trump said you know
let's do the vetting and get the the
good people let's make sure they can add
something that's a trump plan why aren't
we doing it in this country is it is it
mysterious huh he's doing it in El
Salvador like so it can be done and and
every part of it is smart and every part
of it is practical and every part of it
could be done right away why wouldn't
you do something that's smart practical
obvious easy and could be done right
away sort of a mystery well the only
thing I can think of is that the CIA is
in charge of immigration in our country
and they don't want it for some reason I
can't think of any other reason because
it doesn't it doesn't fail on
practicality cost on anything there's
not a single thing wrong with that idea
can't do it here
why why it's because we want these big
old open borders because the cartels
want it and the cartels are working with
the CIA yes every thing you
don't understand is just the CIA
everything all
right meanwhile Federman says he's not
woke especially on this squatter stuff
and Law and Order he says about
squatters squatters have no rights how
can you even pretend that this is
anything other than you're just breaking
the
law he says it's wild if you go on a
away on a trip for 30 days and someone
breaks into your home and suddenly they
have rights this is crazy like like if
this is fedman like if someone stole
your car and then they held it for 30
days then Som now now they have they
have the right to your
car like every part of it is just
crazy so why is it a
law have you ever even seen an argument
in favor of
squatters I have
every other topic CNN will put somebody
on and says oh here's what this point of
view and maybe it's a different network
but somebody else will say no this is
the opposite point of view have you ever
seen a pro squatter point of view no you
haven't they've never put a pro squatter
on TV because there is none only the
squatters are in favor of it so why do
we have this
situation how could you have a situation
where the entire country is against it
every bit of Common Sense and history
and everything we know about people
motivation real estate values the law
everything we know about everything and
you could stop it
tomorrow just by making it illegal to be
a squatter that's all it would take so
why doesn't it
change I can't think of any other reason
other than the
CIA right because when things don't make
sense it's always the same
people now I don't know what they would
have to gain from squatting I have no
idea but it's not because there's some
people in our government who think it's
a good idea there's probably nobody in
law enforcement and nobody in the
government I don't think there's a
Democrat certainly not a majority maybe
you get a couple of squad members to say
something positive but not really so why
do we have
it whatever the reason is and I don't
know the reason it can't be because of
the government or the
people right it's not because of the
people we don't want it it's not even
because of the government government
doesn't want it so who who's left the
government and the people and there's
nobody let's say there's no business
person who wants it the definitely do
you think that the Black Rock even Black
Rock can't control do you think that
black rock and some of these companies
that own like 50,000 houses they bought
for renters do you think they want
squatters that's their business of
course they don't want squatters so even
Black Rock even Black Rock isn't getting
what it wants and they've got a trillion
dollars and they can't get what they
want and the entire country can't get
what it wants and it's easy to do could
be done instantly and there's not a
single proponent for it and it can't get
done what's that sound
like the
Border sounds like the Border because
there's a there you can't even get a
Democrat to say that the current border
situation is a good idea except you know
a couple of French crazy people there's
not even a normal Democrat who thinks
you shouldn't close the border every
time something doesn't make sense it's
the same
guys same guys I don't know what
the play would be in this case but if it
doesn't make sense it all goes to the
same thing uh Wall Street Apes is
reporting that uh apparently the amount
of Social Security we give immigrants is
more than people who worked all their
life in the United States in some cases
so if Grandma comes in across the border
illegally she's going to get the maximum
of Social Security automatically but if
you worked all your life you probably
wouldn't get maximum You' get something
based on how much you worked but not the
illegal grandma she gets
maximum who's in favor of that
wh which which person was on TV arguing
for that none of these things make sense
clearly we don't have any kind of
government or people involved in the
decision making I don't know who is but
I mean it's not even business this this
is one of those rare case where it's not
industry it's not the people and it's
not the government because there's
nobody in any of those entities that
would support this and yet here it is
and can't be changed what is it
it's got to be the same
people because everything else is
changeable except when they're involved
meaning the
CIA New York City is going to pay 17.5
million for losing a lawsuit because
they forced some Muslim women to remove
their their headgear their hijabs for
mug
shots you know I'm a little
bit I'm a little bit on the fence on
this one I think you're expecting me to
you know say they should take off their
hijabs but there is a there's a
religious argument here they do have a
religious argument and if facial
recognition can recognize their faces
without needing to see their hair oh by
the way was they covering their face or
just their head I'd feel different if it
covers their whole face were they uh I
guess I don't know enough about the
story to finish what I was
saying it if it's covering the whole fa
is it's
absurd if it it was just their headgear
and their face was
exposed I think I I might actually favor
the the people who said that's enough
because you can tell Who I Am from my
face it was so the
anyway anyway so depending on which way
that goes it either makes sense or it
doesn't well Jen weager if I'm saying it
right um the Vigilant Fox is reporting
on X that uh he made a shocking
statement they say that he's now
considering supporting RFK Jr because he
says Biden has quote been corrupt his
whole
life now uh Jake is I I have kind of a
LoveHate relationship with him that the
hate part is when I disagree with him
the love part is he was genuinely a free
speech guy he is genuinely free speech
he is genuinely not a affected by his
own team you got to call that out all
right you got to call that out now I
like I say I disagree with a lot of what
he says
but I certainly support him saying
it so he says you're not going to get
anything but corruption and a Joe Biden
um and he says that they rig elections
he says the Democratic party rig they
love to rig elections but he uses the
example of rigging the primaries so that
RFK and you can't even be in it so yes
they rigged their own primaries but you
think they won't rig the
others and uh Jen goes on to say that
he's not crazy about the RFK Junior take
on vaccinations or what he calls his
conspiracy theories and I will uh put
this question back to
Jen can you name anything you don't like
about those opinions you need you need
to a little more specific because you
know the reason you think RFK Jr is
wrong on vaccinations and has conspiracy
theories is because your media told you
that it's not because it's
true Did you know
that Jen did you know that that's not
true that if you actually listen to his
views on vaccinations you would say oh
well I agree with
that if you actually listen to him if
you hear what the media says about him
you're not going toe with that because
what they say is he's just against all
vaccinations or something no he says
they should be tested better you got a
problem with that he he says that
they're not tested but you're under the
impression that they are you can fact
check him has anybody fact checked him
to be wrong about that I haven't heard
that I believe he's quite right about
that that we you know there are a number
of problems about um testing them
combined versus testing them them
separately because we give them to kids
combined but when we test a new one we
test it separately we don't know if you
give them all at the same time if it has
any different effect so those are very
very useful normal rational things to be
asking about and to demand better you
know demand follow-up studies for
example that they don't do that's a
reasonable thing to ask
for and if the conspiracy theory would
include the idea that uh RFK Jr's Uncle
JFK was murdered by the
CIA
well um so I'm seeing a confirmation
that the lawsuit about the hijab was the
head scarf
only all right so I think I'm going to
I'm going to go with a headscarf people
and I'm going to say they have a strong
religious feeling about that especially
if it's the women and they're showing
their faces and a woman's hair can be
different every time you see them oh
yeah I'm on their side I just talked
myself into it if the only thing that's
been covered is their
hair a woman's hair is different every
time you see them how is that going to
help you identify them we're looking for
a
blonde well not blonde today I'm looking
for a long hair well made sure hair
today no I'm I'm totally with them I I
think I'm going to back him 100% on this
yeah yeah ears n you know facial
recognition is so good you know the
facial recognition on your phone I use
it with my hat on my sunglasses
on and it it can only see basically the
bottom part of my face and it's still
identifies me no law enforcement has
everything they need they don't need to
make them violate their religious
preference I'm I'm on there I back them
on that I don't know about the 17.5
million that seems excessive but
yeah I'm I'm okay with that
anyway so I think Jen is another one of
these uh people who's having some male
energy and realizing that the Democratic
party is run by what did Joe Rogan
say rabies infected Hen House something
like that so Jen displaying his uh
genuine male behavior is rebelling
all right
uh the IDF the uh Israeli Defense Force
uh allegedly is pulling forces out of
Gaza um like in some kind of a big way
now I don't know if this is real because
it's a it's a war
zone so don't believe anything out of a
war zone but and they're not giving
details some people say it might be
related to a a ceasefire deal to for
hostages I think that's a good
hypothesis um but they've uh they've
withdrawn all ground troops from the
southern Gaza Strip leaving only one
Brigade in The
Enclave do you think this is part of
something
bigger does it look to you that the
Biden Administration has Twisted the arm
of Netanyahu enough that he just has to
do a
far here's what I think it's a fake
out I think that the Biden
Administration is telling uh Israel you
have to do this thing you have to try
harder for a ceasefire I think Israel
meaning thatan yahu said are you
stupid do you not understand anything
that's happening here no ceasefire could
possibly work we're not going to get all
the hostages back but I will humor you
because for political reasons apparently
you need to try this so I'll tell you
what we'll do we'll pull all our troops
out you can try your stupid idea of
getting all the uh hostages back I mean
it wouldn't be stupid if it worked but
it's not going to work so why don't we
show how your plan
fails let's do that let let's show how
your plan
fails yeah so
I don't know I don't believe anything
from the war zone seems to me that if
they're pulling out it's not real I mean
I I don't think anything like ending the
war is
happening um but it's going to get real
interesting when we figure out what
happens next because it seems to me that
anything short of major brainwashing of
the
population isn't going to work and if
Israel if if the Israelis did a major
brainwashing operation of people that
they had removed from their homes homes
and put in refugee camps what is that
does that remind you of anything people
removed from their homes by the
government put in camps and then
brainwashed who's that remind you
of China and the
Wagers that's exactly China and the
wiggers not a little bit pretty much
exactly now without the sterilization
but you don't need to sterilize if
they're so desperate they can't have
children anyway
so they've got a real
problem you know it's not bad enough
that the what I call the Holocaust asset
the israels always had you know as long
as everybody thought oh you're the
holocost
victims you treat that situation
differently than if they had not been
Holocaust victims so that was always a
big asset in their international
relations and they decided to burn
it by creating something that the
external Community is going to say you
know that wasn't exactly a holocaust but
it reminds us of one because the way we
think about it so therefore we take away
your asset you can't claim that anymore
so if if what they're doing now ends up
with some kind of long-term peace it was
worth using the
asset but if part two is that they
create a semi-permanent Camp of people
their
brainwashing I don't know how we don't
notice that looks like the
Wagers now here's some real
controversial stuff are you
ready I've often said that the way China
treats the Wagers is not as a military
or police
action that rather they treated it the
same way they treated CO as an
infection is something that could spread
like a virus so the first thing you do
is you isolate same thing they did with
the virus and then the next thing you do
is you make sure that the virus is gone
before you stop isolating that would be
the
brainwashing and the you know if they're
sterilizing them I don't know if that's
true but if they are that's part of it
now what
are how should Israel treat Gaza and the
refugees they probably can't do what
China is doing because China doesn't
have to answer to anybody really but
Israel's got more International pressure
so they can't treat it like a
virus but it
is it's it's a mental virus if if the
children have been infected with this
virus of you must grow up and uh and die
trying to kill the
Israelis if that's what they've been
trained with you can't let them out of
the camps until you've removed the
virus but can they do
that could could they create a weager
concentration camp that lasts 20
years because that's what it would take
it would take 20 years of weager
treatment you can't leave this Camp
we're going to bring wash your kids and
then maybe if we're happy with you we
can release a few of you back into
Gaza so there's no right answer but the
only thing that would
work is uh aorin to our Western
sensibilities but is not a boring to
China and let me let me be brutally
honest is China better off or worse off
for brutalizing their Muslim
population is China better off or worse
off for brutally treating their Muslim
population and trying to exterminate
their belief system they're better off
because the Muslim system is
competitive it's not
compatible so to them it's a virus it's
just a mental one and they're trying to
remove it because their long-term
survival literally depends on
it right and that the countries that
don't treat it as a
virus they're going to have to either
limit the amount of it which is what we
do in the united states in the United
States we don't have to treat it like a
virus because you can let Society do
what it does you know it's sort of like
you let the host get rid of the virus on
its own if you br if you brought in one
Muslim family to the United States ever
like in the history of the United States
would you be worried no because they
would just turn into Americans you know
a generation or two they'd just be
Americans
if you bring in more than
that are you in trouble no no they
probably just get become Americans but
there is some
number where too many of them would come
in and maybe they build their own
enclaves and their own towns and then
they don't become as Americanized as if
they were just you know interacting with
everybody we have recently created that
situation so is it
Michigan um I think it's Michigan it's
got a big you know footo
hold if it grows it could go either way
I mean they could just acclimate and
become Americans in one generation you
don't know but if it grows we're going
to have an Israel problem we will have
people who effectively are in inside the
country trying to carve out their own
country with a system that's completely
incompatible so we have the same problem
at some point so uh I like to criticize
China but I don't know what else they
could do like if you say well you solve
it then I don't know I don't have an
idea so ladies and gentlemen have I
proven my
case that the CIA is behind a whole lot
of things you don't understand and as
soon as you understand that everything
makes a lot more sense
am I
right now I uh I'm getting ready to uh
turn off the main feed here and talk
privately just to the locals people they
told me that there's a timing thing that
from the moment I turned it off um
there's some kind of timing thing
so I think it cuts off too
soon so I have to say goodbye to
you and and wrap up and then I have to
sit here doing nothing because the the
part where I sit here doing
nothing seems to get cut
off so here's what I'm going to do
goodbye everybody on the platforms
except locals except I'm not going to go
anywhere for like a minute I'm just
going to see here for a
minute doing not much of
anything I can promise you there will be
no more entertainment if you'd like to
leave now nothing happening not a thing
[Music]
happening okay I think we're ready I'm
going to kill this stream except for the
locals people stay with me locals stay
alive see the rest of you
tomorrow maybe
