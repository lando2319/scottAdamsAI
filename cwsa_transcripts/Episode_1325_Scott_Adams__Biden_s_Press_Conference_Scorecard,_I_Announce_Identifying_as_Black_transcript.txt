hey everybody
come on in come on in yeah it's time
it's time for coffee with scott adams
and are you glad it is i know i know
it's the best time of the day
and let's make it special
because you know what's special about
today
well there's a gigantic penis-shaped
ship that is screwing the
planet earth at this moment
yeah you're not going to get your toilet
paper but we can make that all better
with the simultaneous sip and all you
need is a copper mug or glass of tango
chalice stein a canteen jug of flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that
makes
what yeah everything everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and
you'll hear it around the world
it happens now go
i can feel that cargo ship starting to
be dislodged
one sip that's all it took amazing
well let's talk about all the news
so first of all let's talk about that
giant cargo ship because it's the only
fun thing that happened this week
now that you don't have trump in the
news so much
you have to wait for a cargo ship to
draw a giant penis in the ocean
but we got it we got that if you haven't
watched
the story apparently that cargo ship
that is lodged in the
suez canal prior to that uh the gps
tracking showed a path that looked
suspiciously exactly like somebody
drawing a
and balls now some say it's a
coincidence
i say that if you get stuck in the suez
canal
right after you coincidentally drew a
giant and balls the simulation is
trying to tell us something
i think it's telling us we're screwed
because
in a way and not in a good way because i
think the suez canal is
sort of the planet's colon if you know
what i mean
sort of a tight passage see what i'm
saying
and uh this giant
object is trying to penetrate that
uh but unsuccessfully so far
so we'll see if that gets unloaded
before all your toilet paper disappears
now here's a real uh
a simulation moment i'm not making this
up i had planned this week
to say can you believe that a year ago
you know a little little less than a
year ago we were worried about running
out of toilet paper
and i thought well that's crazy yeah
we'll figure it out we're not going to
run out of toilet paper
well here we are so um
greta tunberg you all know her
how dare you she she tweeted uh
an article and said uh china continues
to build coal-fired plants
at a rate that outpaces the rest of the
world combined
combined they're building more coal
powered plants than the all the rest of
the world
combined
more than three times what was brought
online everywhere else
so china looks to be uh wrecking the
whole planet with their
with their uh their coal their coal
plants
uh but there doesn't seem to be anything
we can do about it
so i guess we're just going to watch
that happen
um yeah but
i feel as though they've got a real
problem there that right
it seems like the air pollution is going
to make them do something
differently pretty quickly because what
would be the point of building a city
you couldn't live in
because of the air but that's what they
got
more about china later so ted liu he
tweeted this about
the biden press conference he said
president biden did a terrific job
totally objective he did a terrific job
at the press conference
he explained the actions of his
administration took to help the american
people
and he set bold new goals to move our
nation forward
well that's pretty good sounds pretty
good but then he added to his tweet
also he didn't tell people to inject
bleach to get rid of the coronavirus
okay that's not so good
and i asked myself does ted liu actually
believe
the bleach drinking hoax
still still i mean i i kind of
understand how
see how you could get rhubarb by it
temporarily
you all know what being rupard means
it's named after aaron rupar at vox
if you get roopard it means you take a
video out of context
to make it look different than what
really was there
so the the drinking bleach hoax was
caused by a rhubarb
they just took the middle of what trump
said and they lopped off
where he said he was talking about light
and then they lopped off the end
where he clarified he wasn't talking
about injections he was talking about
you know light so you just get rid of
that
and then people like ted lou still
believe that
there was something about drinking
bleach in there and even bleach wasn't
even mentioned in that context
so here's what we can do about this
here's how you handle the bleach
drinking hoax are you ready
number one the the existence of the
verb to rupar
turns it from a concept that's hard to
explain
well you know they can make it look
different if you if you remove this
editing
and but if you put a word on it
just the way our brains are organized as
soon as it has its word
to rupaur r-u-p-a-r
rupar once you have a word for it
people's brains interpret it as more of
a thing
because it's got a word now this is a
this is a persuasion trick that i like
to use a lot
anything that doesn't have a word you
can't persuade
it's just got to be boiled down to a
word because words have their own
persuasive power they carry it with them
so until it's a word yeah like borked
exactly
somebody's using to bork or
uh yeah so having the word helps
now when when people say hey he said
drink drink bleach
you say to them oh dude you got rupard
dude you got rhubard you got rhubarb and
bad
do you see how much more persuasive that
is because if you say
your facts are not technically correct
has that ever changed anybody's mind
no note because the facts they'll just
say the facts are wrong
you'll say look i'm making a claim about
what he said
here's the video here's the transcript
i'm not making this up it says right
here he's talking about light
in his own words you can see it on video
would that would that change anybody's
mind
about what they saw you'd think so right
you think that if somebody thought
something was x
and you showed it right to their face
you let them hear it and see it
that they would then think oh okay not x
i guess i got rupard i didn't know it
that will never happen in as long as
you're alive
and once somebody gets committed to the
argument
uh cognitive dissonance will be their
path and i was watching uh
you know some well-informed twitter user
who may or may not be watching this at
the moment
dismantle somebody in the twitter
twitter feed
who believed the hoax and he was just
quoting the actual transcript to just
dismantle it
now did the person then say oh well
thank you for clarifying
nope nope did not
he just went into a cognitive dissonance
spiral
and just became temporarily insane and
that's what you'd expect
that's exactly what cognitive dissonance
is
it's like a weird insanity hallucination
that pops up
when your self-image doesn't match
events
so what this person who was who was
learning
that they had been rhubarb which doesn't
feel good right
if you've been bamboozled or rhubarb you
think
that's a little embarrassing on me
because i
was a little gullible i got rupard a
little too easily
so go for the embarrassment of somebody
being rupard
not the facts the facts won't work but
here
is my second suggestion for getting rid
of this
if i could be a reporter to ask ted lew
some questions i would ask him this
number one do you believe that president
trump recommended drinking bleach to get
rid of the coronavirus
presumably he would say yes yes i do
believe that
now rather than telling him he got it
wrong
i would ask the following question all
right good so you believe the
the drinking belief story i'd like to
get your position on a few more things
what is your position on bigfoot
now he would say oh you're not being
serious now and i would look at him and
say what do you mean
you were talking about the drinking
bleach thing this is just
i'm trying to get some context i'm
trying to trying to understand
how many things you believe are true
because then that would tell us if you
just believe
everything or this is just the one thing
you believe that's not true
because that's important wouldn't you
like to know if somebody is fooled by
every hoax or are they only fooled by
maybe this one which wouldn't be so bad
right just one hoax
we can all be taken in by one hoax
that's just normal
and then he would resist a little bit
and i'd say all right all right let's
let's let that go
my third question is what you feeling
about the loch ness monster
and then he'd be like come on come on
i'm the i'm you i need to take this
seriously and i would say
what do you mean what do you mean take
it seriously i am taking it seriously
we're talking about all the hoaxes you
believe i'm just trying to forget your
opinion on it how about the fine people
oaks
ted do you believe that one you do you
do okay
all right and then you just go down the
the list of hoaxes and you see how many
he
he agrees with trust me it's better than
telling him he's got his facts wrong
all right
so georgia the governor has signed this
georgia election
bill it has it's 100 page election bill
so there's lots of stuff in it but it
includes stuff such as including
a requirement for photo id for even for
mail-in ballots
reducing early voting for runoff
elections and banning the distribution
of food and drinks to people
waiting in line i guess the theory there
is that that can influence their vote
somehow
i don't see how by the time you're
standing in line
are you still undecided
or or is this just to keep people
standing in line you give them food and
drink they'll stay there longer i don't
know
what's the thinking on this so you and i
probably don't know all the details of
why these are even in the law
the democrats say it's voter
suppression is it
are the georgia laws voter suppression
of course they are of course they are
now
they don't sell it that way but of
course it is
just as the rules changes for
2020 were
let's just say they were politically
motivated as opposed to
fairness motivated they weren't so much
for the republic they were for the
democrats
so we have a situation where in all
likelihood i think most smart people
would say this is true
that the 2020 election was decided
largely
by the rule changes that happened before
the election
wouldn't you say because the rule
changes allowed you know
far more people to vote and in ways that
people question
but there were more of them lots more
people voted there's no doubt about that
and so some people say that the rule
changes is what determined
who the president is as opposed to the
the public
because the public was the same public
before the rules as after
the public didn't change it's just how
they count stuff and
who they can get to the polls and how
easily you vote
the the rule changes decided who won
so georgia you know having a apparently
a republican
legislature they just decided to win
next time by changing the rules
so they just changed the rules in a
different way
okay so they just change the rules in a
different way
would this be enough to guarantee that
republicans do better in the next
presidential election
well if it's just georgia maybe that's
not enough but will other states follow
right don't you think other states will
follow
and we may see the republicans
smartening up and just making
rule changes that are designed for
nothing but winning elections
let's face it this is designed to win
elections
it's not about what's fair or good
nobody cares about that
nobody in the government cares about
that they want to get a re-elected
so i feel as though given that the 2020
election was based entirely on
shenanigans with rules that if
georgia does some shenanigans with rules
they're playing the same game i feel
that's fair
i don't think the rules are fair because
fairness isn't a real thing
it's just subjective but it's a good
strategy
and i think it's perfectly acceptable in
the context of
the rule changes being the only thing
that determines an election
all right this is fun
so dominion the election um
software do they have hardware and
software is it just software
but the dominion i guess is both
hardware and software
is suing fox news for 1.6 billion
because they say that fox was claiming
they were
that the dominion stuff was
intentionally rigged
that was the claim there's no court
evidence of that whatsoever
no court proof no court has ruled
that dominion did anything wrong um
but here's the interesting thing have
you ever heard the phrase
a pyrrhic victory i don't even know if
i'm pronouncing it right might be
pyric it's spelled p-y-r-r-h-i-c
have you ever heard that i'm teaching
you that because
you you hear that by people talking on
tv
if somebody uses this phrase they're bad
at talking on tv
because if you're talking on tv you
shouldn't use phrases that
75 percent of the public or more have
never heard of
right but i'm going to teach you so when
you hear it on tv next you'll know what
it means
a pyrrhic victory it's a historical
reference
to a an army that won the battle
but so many of their their soldiers were
injured or killed in the battle
that they ended up losing the war
because they used up too much of their
resources winning a battle
so the idea here is you can win the
battle but be careful that that didn't
cost
you the war it feels like dominion
might win the battle
because they might prevail in the court
case
that's possible but what is uh what is
fox's defense what do you think
will fox use the sidney powell defense
which is
well you can't take anything we say
seriously
it worked for didn't it work for uh
msnbc
with uh uh what's her name
when she got sued didn't she actually
win her case by saying you shouldn't
take anything i say seriously
on a news channel because she's an
opinion person rachel
maddow right i believe she used that
defense cindy powell is going to use the
defense
i think it'll work i think it's a solid
defense
but there's another thing that's about
to happen that i don't know
if dominion has calculated in
unless this is actually part of their
exit plan to leave the business
because it looks like it could be i'm
not saying that's the case because
they'll sue me
i'm just saying if you look at it from
the outside it looks like a company that
plans to go out of business but maybe
they can win some money on the way out
because here's what's going to happen i
think
at least it's what would happen if i
were the
the lawyers and i had the at least the
freedom to introduce this
i would put electronic voting machines
on
trial if if you can get away with it
i'm not sure what will be allowed as as
as evidence here but fox news
if i were them and i were trying to come
up with a strategy
i would try to destroy the idea of
electronic voting no matter who it is
i wouldn't even make it about dominion
i wouldn't even say this isn't even
really about them you could change the
name of the company and
the argument would be exactly the same
which is
that it's a system that isn't
transparent
and therefore reasonable people can have
an opinion that it wasn't fair
or there were issues with it now
if they do that they could probably salt
the earth
so effectively that our government can
no longer support
electronic voting so one of the things
that might come out of this
is the death of electronic voting
everywhere
now i don't know if dominion knows that
that's one of the outcomes
that the entire market for their product
could disappear because of this
now as high-powered as sydney powell is
when they take on sidney powell they are
taking on one person
very high you know high skilled
experienced
attorney you know that's pretty
dangerous by itself right
you take on an attorney at that level
you'd better have the kill shot
right you go after the king you know the
saying right you go you try to
take out the king you better finish the
job
because if the king survives you're in a
lot of trouble
for trying to take out the king
well i think that dominion is sort of
bigger than
or more powerful than sydney powell
despite her
firepower which is considerable so that
was probably a good play to take her on
but fox news is another animal
fox news i don't think they understand
how much firepower can come from that
side of the world
i just don't think they understand what
they're getting into i don't know
but i would think that the rupert
murdoch
uh group um especially supported by
fox news who are professional
communicators
right they're sort of the best
communicators
in the world you know not just because
they're right-leaning but
that's their job they do it
professionally
and between what fox news will report
about this
because they can report it it's news
even though it's about them
it's still news so they can report it
what do you think fox news is going to
start running as
specials just guessing
they're going to run a lot of specials
about how voting machines
in general are a really big
problem i've got a feeling
that rupert murdoch is going to end
electronic voting
as a legal defense basically now he
might lose the case
fox news might lose this case but i
think he's going
i think he's going to kneecap the entire
industry that's just part of the
natural process of the defense so we'll
see
um let's talk about biden's press
conference
you know before the press conference i
had tweeted that
i was asking people to write humorous
reviews of his
press conference before it even happened
knowing in advance that the
friendly press would say he did
incredibly well
so let's see how close we got here are
some of the actual comments
after the press conference this from the
drudge report
who used to be right-leaning but i guess
not so much anymore
it said joe's no drama press conference
chill style grand vision for fdr
presidency art of the impossible
not bad the washington post says
in an opinion piece biden excels at his
first news conference
the media embarrasses themselves
and there were other glowing glowing
reports ted lose for example
so let me give you my opinion here
it wasn't bad it wasn't bad now i
i thought that he would do okay now i'm
only going to talk
about performance here if you're new to
my live streams
this is the thing you need to know i'm
not talking about how
accurate he was with fax because he
didn't pass the fact checks
neither did trump right presidents
typically
fail the fact-checking at press
conferences biden did too
so do you know how do i hold that
against him
i don't i don't the news did
the news did what it does even cnn
fact-checked them
so how much do i care that he got some
facts wrong
not any more than i cared when trump got
some facts wrong right they all do that
that's what the news is for they're
supposed to fact check them and they did
even cnn fact checked them so don't care
about that
how about his uh verbal miscues
where he would start a sentence and it
would just trail off to nothing
pretty scary right this guy's you know
got the nuclear codes and
he's the president of the united states
and he can't finish a sentence
without running off into bumbling
confusion and just saying ah well that's
enough
scary nope
it's not because we're used to it it was
already baked in
in the same way that much of trump's
personality
very quickly just got baked in and it no
longer became
important to your mind anyway it was
always the same amount of importance
but the way your mind processes it is if
if you're used to it
and we're just sort of used to it and we
we are told that biden's you know little
verbal uh miscues are nothing but joe
biden
yeah he's older he's a little less fast
but it's not
that different than he's always been or
at least how he's been for years
so how much do i hold that against him
that a lot of his sentences were
bumblingly and competently ended without
an ending
not much it's sort of it's sort of
everything we knew he was
so i would say that didn't move the
needle it may have confirmed what you
thought
but it didn't move anything yeah i doubt
there was any
democrat who watched that and said for
the first time ever
oh the way he talks now i'm worried
do you think any democrat did that
probably not right
but every republican said oh that's just
what i thought look at him he
can't finish the sentence so nobody's
mind was checked
was changed by that all right
how do you feel about the fact that the
news is reporting that the
questions were known in advance and that
he had answers
literally written out in notes and they
he came very close to reading verbatim
his notes
as his answers to the questions what do
you think of that
well i have a contrarian view on that
i'm one of the people and you probably
did too who praised
kaylee mcinany for being well prepared
and having a whole binder that she could
refer to
so she could you know be really quick
and sharp on all the answers
now if it was if we complimented kaylee
mcinanny for being very prepared and
organized and having it written down so
she didn't miss any good points
why isn't that the same for biden you
know it's being reported by
mostly people on the right that this is
a sign of his declining capabilities etc
and it might be
that's a perfectly reasonable opinion it
looks exactly like that actually
but at the same time he was really well
prepared
right uh now you can say that there were
some questions he didn't answer
like you know i think there was a gun
control answer they
went into immigration or vice versa and
there are things he avoided
but how much do you how much you count
against the president for avoiding a
direct question
well they all do it right so you can't
give them a pass for it but you would
say in context
it's pretty common that they avoid
questions i would say
trump probably didn't do that i think
trump is maybe the only one who would
answer a question like without trying to
just change the topic
has anybody else ever done that is trump
the only president we've had who would
answer a direct question
maybe obama did you know in his own way
there might have been more but so
performance wise he stayed awake
he didn't he didn't say anything that
was clearly dementia
it was just more of what we expected him
and he looked like he had some command
of the facts
yeah i am being generous so somebody in
the comments says
i'm being too generous to biden i'm
being generous
i don't think i'm being too generous i'm
trying to i'm trying to use the same
amount of generosity i would have used
had it been trump right just trying to
make a
make some kind of a comparison now i'll
tell you that uh i would say it's very
clear that
biden is not making the decisions
it looks pretty clear that there's a
power behind biden
but given that they prepared him very
well whoever they are
i feel at least a little bit of
confidence
that there are actually smart people who
are in control
we just don't know who they are which is
a problem
wouldn't you like to know who's in
control i kind of would
now i was trying to think the difference
between what a biden
meeting looks like and what a trump
meeting looks like
we have lots of examples where the
advisors said
trump you've got to do x and then trump
said yeah but i'm not going to
i'm going to call you an idiot in public
and then i'm going to do the opposite of
what you just recommended
hey we need to stay in afghanistan with
major forces
yeah i hear what you're saying we're not
going to do that i'm going to pull
people out of afghanistan
hey we can't possibly have vaccinations
you know quickly yeah i hear what you're
saying but you're going to do it anyway
right so how many times did trump tell
his experts
that he wasn't going to take their
advice i feel like we've got enough
examples of that that was fairly common
right now is that the president you want
do you want the president who goes
against the advice of experts
or do you want a biden-like president
who tells you directly he will take the
advice of experts
and you can see the the work of the
experts
in his presentation the experts sort of
packaged up his answers for each
each topic and then he presented it so
he basically was a mouthpiece for the
experts in some way
did you see any evidence that joe biden
would be capable
of telling an expert to go pound salt
trump did it every day it was like there
probably didn't wasn't a day that went
by when trump didn't
call on an expert and say yeah
i'm not going to do that i hear what
you're saying
that's not going to happen does biden
ever do that
and what do you think about that which
one is the better president
is the better president the one who
calls on the experts
because if you look at trump's record of
calling
on experts it's really good
now it's not a hundred percent it's not
100 i don't make that claim
but if you were to look at all the
things you know don't
cherry pick just look at all the things
that trump called on
pretty good record his hunches
you know his lived experience etc do you
give him some kind of an advantage
in identifying i think he's he
was very good at it
i don't know if biden has that he might
but i don't know
so um here's
here's the thing that's just
mind-blowing that biden is getting
basically a pass on this from
the friendly side of the media that when
he was asked if photographers and
the press would have access to the
border
holding facilities where we know there's
bad situation
you know with people overcrowded etc and
he basically said no
he said we'll give you access after we
fixed it so there's nothing to see
and he said that right in front of the
public like that was okay
how's that okay even the left was saying
are you serious that's not okay
that's not okay for anybody that's not
okay on the right
it's not okay on the left that's not
okay with anybody
right but he just got away with that
he's still president no blowback
whatsoever
you know the people on the right are
blah blah blah but it doesn't matter
and it's just words he actually got away
with telling you he wasn't going to give
you transparency on
hold hold on a human
crisis now he's the guy who cares the
most
about you know that's that's his brand
right he cares the most
about the humanity of the actual
migrants who are in a bad situation
there and yeah he won't let the
the press see the bad situation
it's amazing that he's getting a pass on
this there's no way that trump would
have
um so i think that was his worst
point was the the immigration stuff
um he was boring
trump is more interesting definitely
um and here's another thing i think he
got wrong
on north korea he says that you know
they're
basically they're they're talking about
what to do about it because north korea
fired some missiles
test missiles and um
biden is doing the the old thing where
you say they won't negotiate with north
korea unless north korea commits
to negotiating toward denuclearization
is that going to work is that going to
work
do you think north korea is going to say
oh oh
oh well i didn't know about this whole
denuclearizing thing yeah
well now that you mention it we'll just
get rid of our nukes and then
everything's good right
how about that i feel as if
biden and really the the way we've
always treated north korea in the past
is all wrong and and trump was the only
one who got that right
and it goes like this north korea isn't
going to get rid of the nukes
it's not going to happen i mean even if
they you know
tone down their testing or whatever
they're still going to have some
capacity that they could
that they could ramp up if they had to
the smarter option
is to talk to north korea to talk them
out of being our enemy
and just remove the threat because we
don't have a reason to threat them
to threaten them we have no reason to do
anything bad to north korea now or ever
as long as they don't do bad things to
us
and i think that was the the trump magic
that he convinced north korea is like
we're not even in your game
we don't even care about you if you'd
like to make some money we can help
but that's the only thing we care about
you is if you'd like to make some money
with us we
we can help some investments and stuff
now it's going to be hard to do
if you're on war footing with south
korea but that's your business
our business is we'd like to do some
business with you we don't want to
attack you
and what happened north korea seems way
less aggressive or did under trump
now that's probably the best you can get
but i would take it to another level
i would tell north korea you know we
don't think you should build nukes and
aim them in our direction but
we can't make any promises about china
if i were you and i were that close to
china you might want to keep those nukes
because you're going to need to aim them
at
beijing because china is a real threat
to north korea
don't you think because china is going
has absorbed
hong kong as was their legal right
more or less i mean they may have taken
it too far
they probably will absorb taiwan
within the next 10 years just because
it's close and because they can
does north korea think that america is a
bigger risk
than north korea right on the border of
china
i don't think so i think china is a way
bigger risk to north korea
and the way china would take over would
be you know infiltrating and you know
buying and bribing
and you know doing their their soft
long-term influence thing to control
north korea
uh there's no way that kim jong-un
should be on their team
he should be on our team
and then you're fine because people
don't nuke their own team
he should be on our team against
china china is the threat to the world
it's got to be a threat to north korea
now they can't treat north korea like
they can't treat china like a threat
because they're
still dealing with them but
realistically
from a long-term military perspective
north korea and china are the problem
with each other we're not
so i would make that case i think
biden's got that wrong
all right so overall if you said uh
biden
had a very low bar for expectations i
would say he exceeded that
is that fair the bar was so low that he
exceeded it fairly easily
i was i would give him a good mark on
his performance performance
he gets you know the usual failing grade
on accuracy they all do
he gets a you know bad grade on handling
the border
bad grade on handling north korea didn't
really answer a lot of questions
but he didn't need to accomplish any of
those things i'm criticizing
so if you were to make a list of all the
things that don't matter
he didn't do them very well all right
being accurate it doesn't really matter
and he didn't do it very well
but it doesn't matter what did matter
that he didn't he didn't
decompose in front of the public what
did matter is that he had details and
on all of the questions what did matter
is he spoke with some authority
active presidential i think he pulled it
off
i think he pulled it off
all right but um certainly not giving
him a total pass
now interestingly uh two left-leaning
journalists
uh did not agree with each other so when
al cinder yamiche alcindor i think she's
npr
was when she asked a question embedded
in the question was the assumption
that or maybe accusation depending what
you want to call it
that because biden was a nice guy that
that was what caused or
and he was talking nice about
immigration that that caused more
immigration
whereas reuben tweeted yamiche makes the
statement
unproven that his words set off the
surge
this is factually wrong now reuben of
course
uh is not like other journalists uh she
is a little more of a team player than
even people who are team players
but i would say that biden
and his his media who are trying to say
that the surge is not because of biden
they did a good job now here was the
argument if you haven't heard it
i think you've heard it that the surge
is actually no different than prior
years
and then if you add the fact that the
coronavirus caused what would have been
a surge to not happen last year
though all you're seeing is this year's
normal surge
plus a little excess surge because
people would have come the year before
but they couldn't
so now they're just coming this year so
it's just a big year for
surges but not because of anything
it just would have happened anyway for
economic reasons and
seasonal reasons and everything now is
that true
is it true yeah i'm seeing in the
comments i see you saying that it's just
not true
that the way they're counting it is
wrong
if you talk to the migrants they'll tell
you they're coming because of bite
the interviews i've seen they say it
directly
would you have come if tr if trump had
still been president
maybe not did you come because biden
said
you know things would be better yes
they say it directly now
so i'm not saying that biden is accurate
when he defends himself by saying that
the surge is
you know no worse and that he also says
that there were facilities in place to
handle the surge that
trump dismantled that's probably a
little bit true
so if you were simply to um to judge
whether biden defended his practice as
well
just rhetorically he actually did with
the help of the media
and i i'm totally surprised right i'm
totally surprised
and i'm not buying their statistics i do
think it's a real surge
that really comes because of biden now
that's a belief
but they did a good job a good job of
defending
their situation you don't have to
believe they're they were being honest
but it was a good defense i was
surprised more it was better than i
thought it would be
and even reuben and elsington are on the
different sides about whether uh there
was anything to that
all right uh there's a weird thing
happening in the world with cotton
you know i've told you that one of the
things about the simulation is that
there's some
themes that once you see them they just
keep repeating
and it could be just a coincidence
probably is
but it's always interesting so cotton is
in the
in the news for all different reasons so
i guess uh h
m and nike are being boycotted in china
because they've made noise opposing the
slave labor that picks the cotton
that goes into the products so
american companies are being boycotted
are they both american
h m i don't know are being boycotted for
uh
opposing slavery you know the uyghurs
forced labor cancer etc
and china's pushing back they're
pro-slavery
and so you got that happening
then at the same time you've got tom
cotton who's making some news
i'll talk about in a moment and he also
talks about china all the time
and we're also talking about slavery
reparations
that's in the news a lot lately
which of course is the legacy of you
know the cotton plantations and
everything
why is it that cotton suddenly became
like one of the most common words in the
news
what's up with that speaking of
tom cotton he's i guess he's introducing
legislation to ban
critical race theory training in the us
military
once again i say are there other
senators
the the only senators you see doing
anything it's like
ted cruz rand paul
tom cotton and
we're done here right is it just the
same people doing all the work
i'm not sure i would even consider
voting you're even supporting let's say
for president
anybody who isn't one of these people
oh josh hawley's he's making some noise
yeah
josh hawley but it's just a handful of
people they're doing
they're doing all the things that matter
it seems like and everybody else is
doing
what what the hell are they doing
what's rubio done i'm seeing rubio's
name what's he done
lately i know but i would say
at the moment if you were to judge just
on you know who's
taking on things and who's introducing
legislation and who's moving the needle
and
who has their priorities right it's kind
of tom cotton's looking pretty good
and he's also not making what i'd call
the rand paul
mistake the rand paul mistake is that
he's dying on the hill of these
face masks and you just can't win that
fight
i mean he can be right i'm not arguing
he's wrong
i'm just saying it's the kind of fight
that's really a bad one if you want to
run for president later
because people are going to remember it
they're going to say you were wrong
you're anti-science or whatever but i
don't see tom cotton even making an
issue of it he's going after
you know the the racism in this country
good
he's going after china really hard good
good stuff all right
um there is uh
in oakland they're doing a program where
they're going to give 500
checks to low-income families so i
i guess this is like a ubi kind of a
thing i'm not sure
if how how long it's going to go but
there's a
there's a restriction to it so if you're
poor
if you're low income and then oakland
you'll get a 500 check unless
you're white so you can't get to check
if you're white
um other ethnic groups i guess are okay
but not if you're white and so i'd like
to give this financial advice to young
people
and i follow my own advice if you're
young
you should definitely hold bitcoin just
you know even if bitcoin goes out of
business it looks like it could grow
fast in the future
so when you're young you should get
things that are a little riskier
but they could go big because even if
you lose all your money when you're
young you have
plenty of time to make it up so if
you're young you should hold bitcoin
and then secondly you should identify as
black
and i'm only saying to do it for the
money not for any other reason
and i'm going to announce today that i
uh going forward i do identify as black
and i had my uh my dna
analyzed by 23andme and
i do have origins in africa now i don't
know how
much your origins have to be but i think
you just have to identify that way right
those are the rules now i told you that
the best way to break a system you don't
like is to embrace it
so i embrace it i do believe
that people who don't let's say look
exactly black
can identify as black right because
there are lots of examples that
there are plenty of people who if you
looked at them you'd say
i don't know if they're black you know
just looking at them i can't tell
but if they identify as black
those are the rules that you can
identify as black
and then you are so i'm going to
identify as black i've got a little bit
of african-american in me according to
23 to me and i also have a lived
experience
which i think fits the model
uh most of you know the story that when
i was working for a big bank
early in my career my boss called me in
the office and told me that i couldn't
be promoted
because i'm white and male now when i
tell this story people say
that didn't happen or they say
um i think you're making that up
or they say maybe you thought that's
what was happening
but they certainly wouldn't say it
directly let me say this as clearly as
possible
my boss said it directly
you can't get promoted here because
you're white
and you're male directly so i quit
of course what would you do if if your
company tells you you can't be promoted
because of your gender and your race you
quit
so when that happened i of course had
plenty of other opportunities to go to
things worked out for me
but i did feel for a moment
what it would be like to have racial
discrimination determine
your career options because it literally
happened
so i left the bank and i took a job at
the
local phone company the pacific bell at
the time and i got on the uh
the management track so they had an
actual program
that if you were identified as somebody
who might be able to rise to the ranks
they would put you on the program so
that you would get extra mentoring and
stuff and people would know who you were
and so i got in the program and it
looked like i was going places
finally finally i could rise based on my
skill
and not the color of my skin but
one day my boss called me into his
office
and again i'm not making this up
there's no hyperbole here told me
directly
in clean direct language i'm afraid
we've been told
we can't promote white
males because we don't have enough
we don't have enough diversity in senior
management and we'll never get it if we
just keep promoting white males
and i said well how long is this going
to last
and my boss to his credit said i don't
know
i don't know i mean it's not going to go
away soon
i don't know if it ever went away
so two major careers i lost
because of my race
and my gender now again
before you bring out your tiny violins
white man complaining who went on to get
rich easily
because he's a white man in america
tiny little violin i hear you
i hear you i'm not saying that i didn't
have options
things worked out pretty well for me i'm
not even saying that
companies should not um
you know work hard for affirmative
action i think they should
and i just happened to be in the wrong
place at the at the wrong time
so but i had options so again i'm not
complaining
in the sense that you know oh my life is
over i don't i don't work that way i
just
go where i have opportunity and and
leave
leave where i don't i think everybody
should do that
and and so when
i i know people think that that i'm
joking about this or that i say it for a
fact
or i say it just for persuasion but when
i say
i know what it feels like to lose a job
because of your race or your gender
i literally know what that feels like
twice
and these are major careers this is this
wasn't i took a job you know as a bagger
at the grocery store for a year and it
didn't work out
the both of these were supposed to be my
career
and and i was bummed out
um so
that's it so i identify as black going
forward i would
uh encourage all of you to do the same
i'm not kidding by the way i'm not
kidding
just in case you thought i was i'm not
pelosi was making some news today
you know i guess the last few days and
she says that is her right as a speaker
she says
to seat or unseat any member of congress
she wants
uh even if the election is certified
now a lot of people are saying doesn't
that make you
sort of the empress of the country but i
guess she is
but the interesting part is you have to
see your video talking about that
because i don't know what she's done
recently
cosmetically but her eyebrows are trying
to escape her mouth area
and they just keep getting higher on her
head until i think the eyebrows and the
hairline have just become one
and i think we may see other
other portions of her face uh likewise
trying to escape
the mouth area because the things that
come out of her mouth are pretty scary
and if i were her eyebrows i would i'd
make a run i'd make a run for it
if i were the ears i'd try to get like
around to the back a little bit
for the nose i don't know the nose is
going to be hard
from the eyes i might want to try to
keep them closed or something but you
want to get as far away as you can from
this like mouthful area
and the eyebrows are leading the pack
all right
so
and that is my show for the day unless i
can think of something right now
um
wait princeton you are you kidding me
princeton university
uh president christopher eisgruber
somebody in the comments is saying
is promoting the fine people hoax
princeton
i have a friend from princeton who
believes all the hoaxes
they graduated from princeton believes
every hoax there is not a hoax he
doesn't believe and believe me you can't
talk him out of it
so princeton's got a problem
princeton's got a problem um
uh what's happening this weekend
somebody asked
all right i'm going to turn off uh
periscope
and uh i will talk to you later
all right youtubers because you're
special at the moment
um the
you're asking why somebody asked what
years my career was scuttled yeah that
was 80s correct
80s and early 90s
late 80s early 90s actually
big bigfoots are real somebody says
start hanging out with bill maher i
don't think bill maher wants to hang out
with me
you know i was on his show and uh
let's just say
we didn't have chemistry i'll just say
that
um but he was in a hurry he had to get
somewhere after the show
so he he just came into the show and ran
i didn't we didn't really chat
um oh yeah
you know i i somewhat missed the details
there's some kind of story about hunter
biden
hit what was it his girlfriend threw
away his handgun
in a trash can by a school and then
there was maybe a form that he filled
out when he got it that he lied to
he lied on and maybe he should go to
jail
you know
i i don't know what to say about that
story it isn't big enough
to matter it's just one guy with a
problem
would like to see another conversation
with you and sam harris wouldn't that be
interesting
wouldn't that be interesting yeah um i'm
not doing any media right now so i
wouldn't do it right away
but um at some point when i started
doing media again
that would be an interesting
conversation i'd love to catch up with
them
because the fun thing about sam harris
is that he's super smart and well
informed
so if you disagree with somebody who's
super smart and well informed
that's just always fun you know maybe
you'll learn something watching that
all right
oh there's a bigger story about the
secret service etc with the hunter story
okay
got it
um and yes as people said if if that had
been don jr instead of hunter it would
be a whole different story yeah we all
agree with that
but there's also you know the difference
is if you're pro-gun or not so it
wouldn't be exactly a
good analogy
uh yeah lying on a gun purchase is a
felony it
probably should be a pretty big one
don't you think as felonies go
but wouldn't it be interesting if his
defense was that
the constitution allows antonicon
imagine if he said yes i admit i did lie
on this forum
because that's probably going to be easy
to prove but i lied in this forum
because i have a second amendment right
to own a gun
and your form can't stop me from my
second amendment right
wow would that work that would be
interesting
um somebody says it's automatic jail
i don't know i'd like to know how they
go oh i didn't do the clubhouse event
i i postponed that again i'm just having
a little bit of a scheduling problem
with me and my guests being available at
the same time
the one thing i like about clubhouse is
you just jump on and do it
you don't have to schedule
so here's a little thing that just
happened in my neighborhood
and this tells you how
weird the world is right now because
there's a bunch of people who got rich
during the pandemic at the same time a
whole bunch of people lost everything
so it was this weird situation where
some people were doing great while other
people were just
just getting hit hard but one of the
things that happened is where i live
i'm outside of san francisco and i'm
outside of all the bad parts of san
francisco like everything that's bad
about
san francisco the city i'm i'm just
outside that because i'm in the suburbs
outside
and so as people left the city they came
here
there is a 2300 square square foot home
around the corner that just sold
for half a million dollars over the
asking price
what one before that just sold for four
hundred thousand dollars
over the asking price and it's because
and there's
there almost no homes are even available
to buy here and the reason is that all
the
the the city and the valley people
once they could work remotely as soon as
you could work remotely
they came to my town because this is the
perfect place to work remotely
and and there are people who sold homes
that were worth you know whatever
millions
in the in the city were in the valley
and they had tons of money because they
sold their
their homes and then they came here and
wrote and raised all of our prices
but have you ever heard of that have you
heard of multiple homes
selling for half a million dollars over
the asking price
now we're only talking about a home that
was selling i think it was listed for
2.2 million we're not talking about a
like a 50 million dollar home that sold
for half a million over the asking price
it was listed for 2.2 and sold for 2.7
and 2.2 was was a market comp
it sold for half a million dollars over
the comps
for the neighborhood i mean that's just
crazy
all right so that's what's going on in
my neighborhood
unfortunately i'm not selling my house
it would have been a good time to do it
i will talk to you
later
