good morning everybody
how are you it's good to see you i hope
you all brought your beverages
because it's gonna be one of the best
days ever
yeah today is shaping up to look really
good
let's check the stock market see what's
going on there anything happening in the
stock market
what looks like apple and
amazon are doing pretty darn good pretty
darn good
so i know that many of you here are here
for the
the laughs the excitement the
camaraderie
the news the information the emotional
and intellectual titillation but
many of you are here for the
simultaneous sip and all you need
if you would like to participate is
the copper marker glass of tanker
chelsea's dino canteen jogger flask a
vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dope immediate of the day the thing
that makes everything better
including the pandemic economics
stock market unemployment everything
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
sublime says that surgery changed you
um let me address that
because since many of you watch me every
day
i should address the fact that there's
certainly some kind of chemical change
going on here
so part of it is the surgery on my
sinuses which should change the
my vocal quality a bit don't know if
it's permanent yet
but i'm also still on prednisone so the
prednisone
changes both my personality makes me
more aggressive
and a little more energetic i think but
also because i had sinus surgery
this will be the first time you've ever
seen me
when i'm not using marijuana every day
so for a while i have to keep that in my
system so i was awake for
36 hours straight or something if you
don't count
anesthesia i was awake for 36 hours
because
my brain is just going crazy just
adjusting to the new chemical
composition
it's such a difference from normal
so we don't know how this is going to
turn out i'm actually
on an experiment kanye tweeted just now
well i don't know what that is um
but we'll find out together i guess
let's talk about the news
here's a question so i guess in the
first
nba game all of the players and coaches
uh
knelt now the total amount that i care
about this issue
zero zero i don't really care who
kneels before a sporting event is there
anything less important
i don't think so it's probably the least
important thing happening in the world
and yet it's you know headline news but
here's my provocative question
if china did not want the nba players to
kneel
could they have done it i'm just trying
to cause trouble
just think about it if if china had some
real problem
i don't know why they would but let's
say they did let's say
for example that kneeling was an insult
in china
it isn't i don't think but imagine it
was
could the nba players have all knelt
and i think the answer is no
which is just a funny thought not funny
for them
i think nba is going to have some
problems
obviously now the big story yesterday
was the president tweeted about
uh maybe we should delay the elections
just so we'll
have the votes counted because if
they're if they're voting by mail
yeah there might be some delays and of
course
that causes everybody to say you
fascist you fascist you
but it was the president being the
president
i don't know how anybody can take this
stuff as completely
literal anymore and and then
comment on it in public and act as if we
don't all know
that president trump is president trump
he has a certain style of communicating
you know he'll use a little hyperbole
he'll he'll bluff he'll take the
he'll take a high offer he'll shake the
box
so when you see something like maybe we
should delay the elections
what kind of filter should you put on
that well i'll tell you the one you
shouldn't put on it there's one that's
definitely wrong
that he's decided to become a dictator
and take over the country
that's the most wrong one that was
pretty ridiculous
now does he mean it does it matter
what's the context
probably doesn't matter at all uh here's
my take
and this is from uh jason uh i i
tweeted him a trained hypnotist
who had this take on it on twitter
that by president trump putting out the
thought
that the election could be delayed he
has actually trapped
the democrats do you see it it's not
it's not exactly obvious i had to i had
to play with it in my mind a little bit
to see if this made sense
and i don't know if it's intentional or
it's just you know the way it turns out
but imagine that the democrats spend the
next two months
arguing that the election result must be
determined on election day
or or some you know some period around
then if there's some
some adjustments but certainly not past
you know january 20th in inauguration
if they spend their whole time arguing
that the election should be accepted
on whatever day they think it should be
done election day let's say
they're also going to be priming
themselves to accept whatever the result
is
so if they commit themselves publicly to
saying that whatever we see on election
day
is the result they have also bound
themselves to accept it
and they might not want to now what
president trump has done
and i just shake my head when i see him
do this because
there are some times when he's the only
smart person in the country
it seems at least in public so when he
was asked if he would accept
the outcome of the election both the
last one and this
upcoming one he said some version of
we'll have to see
that's exactly the right answer every
other answer
is just dumb because if you say i will
accept it
you're just limiting your options why
would you do that
who would limit their own options before
they're forced to do it
and you see this consistently trump will
always say how about i'll keep all of my
options open
no no no tell us what you're going to do
no how about
i keep all of my options open do you
think you'll use nuclear weapons
i've got an idea why don't i why don't i
keep
all of my options open do you think
you'll do this or that with china
i've got an idea why don't i keep all of
my options open
he does it all the time so when he does
it with the election
is it because he's a fascist dictator
who's going to take over well that's
what the left says
but it's also exactly what he does all
the time and everything
he always keeps his options open now
could you guarantee that the result of
our election will look
fair and credible and it will be you
know
a real election can you guarantee that
because i can't guarantee that i think
it'll happen
i'm optimistic but i don't know
and if you don't know keep your options
open
i don't think we're going to have any
kind of a coup or
violent insurrection or anything so i'm
not too worried about it
but let me ask you this suppose your
results were in the
let's say you're within one or two
percent in the final outcome
so let's say the final presidential race
no matter which side wins
is you know real close like they usually
are
how many influences are we going to look
at after the fact
to say what changed the election
we're going to look at the you know the
russians doing some lame thing that
a second grader could do we're going to
look at all of china's influence
we're going to look at uh the news how
they
how they handle things and almost all of
it
i don't know maybe none of it will
matter because
i've got a feeling that the voters have
made up their minds
all right um i recommended on
twitter this morning that you all follow
this account
by uh andres backhouse
at uh andreas shrugged uh you can see my
tweet if you want to follow him
the reason you should follow him is he's
uh he lives in germany
he's a german citizen speaks perfect
english phd in economics and
he's my go-to for looking at all the
pundits and experts
claims to see if they're consistent the
data is right
they've looked at it right i've told you
in my book
loser think that people who have the
right talent stack
are much better suited for explaining
the world
a phd in economics is a really good
place to start if you're going to look
at other people's data and see how
they've
you know how they've compared things so
if you want to know if somebody has
compared things correctly
you want a phd in economics and and
andres is the best i've seen
so on almost all of the issues in
america he weighs in
on the big twitter debates and
consistently has probably the best takes
i've i've seen on almost all of the
topics
today he uh humorously corrected chris
cuomo
so this is what this is why it's so much
fun
so i guess chris cuomo was saying on cnn
last night
that germany was doing much better with
its economy
than the united states so that germany
had handled the pandemic and they'd also
done better than us in terms of you know
not
losing as much economically as maybe
they could have
but it turns out that he just looked at
the wrong numbers
that chris cuomo whose background in
training his talent stack
is he's an attorney that's good but
that's not really
quite the right you know field for this
conversation
and chris guam is very smart uh you may
he may disagree but i think it's
objectively true that he's smart
and uh and he's you know journalist
and does his job so his talent stack is
pretty strong
but he does have maybe a blind spot for
the economics
which would not be unusual that would be
the common situation
uh but what he did he just apparently he
just confused some gdp
and growth rates comparing the united
states so he basically compared an apple
to an orange
if you as andres pointed out if you
compare the apple to the apple
the united states did a little better so
it actually completely reversed
the story from germany is kicking our
butts
to actually we were a little bit better
a little bit better
and so i provocatively put this
challenge out on twitter
if you plan to criticize president trump
later and you know you do you know and
i'm talking about
the left and the right right the the one
thing we can guarantee
is that both the left and the right will
criticize president trump
when it's all over and now too right
everybody's got their complaints
i would ask you this and i like to keep
reminding people if you're tr if you're
evaluating president trump's
performance with the pandemic and with
the the economy
you can't do it in a vacuum it's got to
be compared to something that's relevant
otherwise you don't know if it's better
or worse than some standard
and i would just challenge people if
they plan to
criticize the president later and you
know you do so this is most of you
pick your champions now pick the other
countries
and the other leaders and state them in
public
and say i'm going to compare president
trump in the future
to germany that i think that would be
one comparison
maybe canada maybe you pick a couple of
european countries
you know what it whatever you think is
fair but just name your champion
once you have your uh somebody helpfully
is putting andres
backhouse the spelling in the comments
so you can see there
so pick your champion and the reason i
say this is if you can't pick your
champion now
i'm not sure you can tell who's doing a
better job
later because you get to cherry-pick
your comparison
after the fact i would say let's put
them up against the
you know the countries that are as
comparable as you can get
maybe as a group that might even be
better
but i have this prediction and it goes
like this
some countries will be better than the
united states at handling the pandemic
that's guaranteed some countries will do
better than the united states
maybe handling the economy in their own
country
maybe but i don't think many countries
are going to do better at both and
that's going to
be interesting because the economy and
the
and the virus are um
almost exchangeable they're they're
almost like a currency that one can pay
for the other
in other words if the virus goes up it's
bad for the economy
and you know people die from the virus
but they also die from the economy
so they're sort of linked right
and i don't think you're going to find a
situation when this is all done
where there are many countries that beat
the united states on
both both measures
you know handling the pandemic and
deaths and also keeping the economy
alive which also keeps people alive
so let's wait for that that's that's my
challenge to the world if if you're
going to criticize him
later tell us now who you're going to
measure him
against that's fair
all right the
turns out that we're getting some
reports that i don't yet
trust about countries completely getting
on top of the virus
maybe to the point of being past it
which seems over-optimistic to me
so here are a few of the stories jake
novak reports
or tweeted today that israel says
that it may it may have beat it so
israel
is looking like it got on top of the
virus
wiped it out it may it may be a
non-problem very soon in israel
now i don't know that that can last
because it depends how
much you can control your borders and
stuff because there's got to be new
virus coming in i don't know how that
could
not be the case so i am
i would say that i am appropriately
skeptical
of any country that claims that they've
they've beaten it or they're near
beating it because i don't know that
that is a thing
yet so but so israel is reported
uh i'm seeing reports again everything i
say here should be
considered not credible because we live
in a world in which
a hundred percent of our information is
untrustworthy
well i don't know if you can say that
about information
i would say that the data cannot be
trusted
for basically anything right now some of
it has to do with the pandemic some of
it has to do with
the fact that data is never good we just
think it is sometimes but we're getting
smarter now
so that the more we get red pilled about
the real way that the world works
the less you should believe any data any
because all data is just politics
ultimately
you know if you see any public data that
has some kind of public purpose
you should just see it as almost an
opinion because somebody made that data
somebody collected it and if it didn't
agree with their
point of view you probably never would
have seen it
so there isn't much difference in 2020
between hard data
we're going to use our hard data to make
decisions and
i think i'll just use my opinion you
think there's a difference
you want there to be a difference maybe
there used to be a difference
but there's definitely not a difference
now now data is just opinion
packaged up with numbers it's all
fraudulent
people will pick whatever starting
points and ending points
make their case they'll measure what
they want to measure they'll ignore what
they don't want to
include so i would say we're in a world
where all data
should be considered wrong that should
be your first
your first judgment is that it should be
almost certainly wrong
sometimes it will be right but so
rarely that you should almost count it
like it's not a thing
that's that would be my advice so
there's
uh as i'm seeing reports on twitter
which means
no credibility at all that sweden has
basically beaten the virus
that they got to something like herd
immunity didn't completely close their
economy although their economy did take
a hit
just because people did socially
distance voluntarily
is that true because i don't know that
that's true
yeah and again sweden might flare up
again but
somebody's saying it so another tweet
that haiti
which was being used as an example
because they have the worst
health care situation so the question is
what would happen to a country that
basically just didn't have good health
care
and just got ravaged by the coronavirus
what would happen
if haiti is that example and if the data
is right which again
what are the odds it would show that
haiti just basically
built up herd immunity and they're
already past it
without too much death now
i don't know if that's true but you're
gonna hear lots of stories about you
know this country or that country
you know got past it got hurt immunity i
would say you should be
very cautious about believing any of
that but here's what i would like to see
given how hard it is to actually know
anything for sure
there are only these little
opportunities where you might be able to
pick out some data that you could
actually trust
and it might tell you something it's
rare
but i would suggest this and i'd be open
to comments whether this is
dumb or brilliant but it goes like this
i'd like to see a list of the countries
where hydroxyl chloroquine is available
over the counter
without a prescription and has been for
the last several months
so i don't care what happened before the
pandemic but during the pandemic
was you know which countries had
hydroxychloroquine
over the counter now here's the beauty
of what i'm going to suggest
if you look at any one country i don't
believe those numbers at all
i completely don't believe any numbers
from any one country
united states or anywhere else but
if you were to sum together let's say
let's say there were two dozen countries
that you could find that definitely had
over-the-counter
hydroxychloroquine and if that total
group on average
was way better at getting past the
pandemic
than the group that was only by
prescription or
had other limitations would that be
meaningful
it might be but it also might not be
because there could be other
correlations it could be something about
temperature or something about density
for example
you know do you have as much density in
the warmer
areas where there's also malaria where
they also had hydroxychloroquine
so you've got the temperature
environment season
density you might have some kind of uh
your genetic thing that that mixes
things up
somebody says don't forget the zinc well
yes let's not forget the zinc
but the point is um
the zinc question is important so so put
a pin in that
but if you found that the
over-the-counter hydroxychloroquine
people were all doing better
even with amazing because probably
people would be smart enough to pick up
a little zinc
i don't know is that hard can you get it
over the counter too
i mean i know you can buy zinc over the
counter obviously duh
but is it the medical grade zinc
that is meant to be working in concert
with hydrox chloroquine is there any
difference
if i just buy some walmart zinc is it
just as good
i don't know because i have some the
first thing i did was go out and buy
some zinc
so i mean i have some in my cabinet all
right so
would it tell us anything if those
groups are different because
you know the the frontline doctors that
are been in the news lately
have been talking about making
hydroxychloroquine uh over
over-the-counter in the united states
and i'd like to know if anybody had a
good result with that
if nobody if the average of them didn't
get any good results
well i'd be less inclined to think
that's the most important thing we
should do
but maybe who knows
um here's an interesting thing
i didn't know this when it happened but
president trump tweeted
this he was talking about how we're
going to be building back
this was on the 27th so a few days ago
and i i
only saw it yesterday yeah he's talking
about if sleepy joe biden the puppet of
the left ever won
markets would crash and cities would
burn which i think is actually
literally true the markets would crash
and cities would burn
it's funny you just automatically think
that's hyperbole
but i don't know i mean it could
this is definitely in the realm of
completely believable
future scenarios that cities would burn
you know because
biden is on the side that wants to
defund the police so it doesn't take
many dots to be connected
for a city to be on fire but then his
tweet goes on he goes our country would
suffer like never before
and then trump says we will beat the
virus soon and go on to the golden age
better than ever before hashtag
golden age now i'm the one who said
hashtag golden age that's not in the
the tweet but i'm liking a lot the
president's
um view because i am a hundred percent
on board with it have you noticed that
uh and and let me not minimize how bad
things are right now
there are people dying they're people
and at work there's there's a big hunger
problem
that's that's growing in the united
states that might be our
not might be it should be our top
priority
is the hunger problem so we got really
serious problems
but as the president indicates there is
something about this virus
and the pandemic that is renewing
you can feel that right i'm not the only
one i don't think
there are so many things that got
changed
and um our perspective on just every
part of life
changed so substantially
that i think it opens up a whole bunch
of possibilities that weren't there
before
education definitely going to change
commuting will change our relationship
with china
will change we'll bring in our supply
chains
we've learned a ton about virology we're
probably safer from future pandemics
i mean right down to just the most basic
things
let me give you the smallest example
i still had somebody in my business life
uh
my book publisher who was still mailing
me a physical check
now i don't know about you but do you
get mad when somebody gives you a
physical check
well i get mad every time i get one or i
i'm even matter if i have to write one
because i feel like what is this that
the 1600s i'm writing on a piece of
paper with a
you know a feather quill or something to
exchange monetary value
and because of the pandemic my publisher
said well we can't do these physical
checks anymore
so we'll do direct deposit just fill out
this form
to which i said thank you
thank you you just saved one of my
problems now this is the smallest
problem in the world
but multiply it by seven billion people
you know changing and correcting all the
ways they're doing everything
and and it's like a million things that
are small improvements
somebody said in the comments say
handshakes handshakes might go away
i kind of doubt it but they might
would that be an improvement it could be
just getting rid of handshakes could
lower
health care costs five percent or
something i don't know
not five percent probably um
so let's talk about uh uh so the
the golden age might be coming there
might be really good stuff ahead
and the online stuff the delivery stuff
it's just going to be incredible but we
have to get past this bad patch
uh biggest story maybe today is the
epstein
files being unsealed
credit to mike cernovich who made that
happen
so everything you see in the news for
the next however long
about these new epstein files that come
out you should think to yourself
that would not have happened without
mike cernovich
and i got to say this i i mentioned him
almost too much
but he he makes such a perfect example
of of things that i like to talk about
that it just has to be mentioned
and it goes like this um
those of you who follow mike zorovich on
twitter you know that
most of the time he's hanging out with
his two young daughters
taking care of them tweeting and stuff
and his but he's built a talent stack
that includes you know legal
investigative you know social media it
just keeps you know growing
at his power just watching his ability
to influence the entire freaking planet
from his house with his phone
is like the coolest thing if you've been
watching it the whole time
so he went from you know a guy who was
trying to get a mindset book going
and sort of a fringy character and
you know there was the pizzagate thing
and you know people had their opinions
about that
and then you know hoax came out is
probably
i would say one of the best
documentaries i've ever seen you know
i'm a little bit biased because i'm in
it
but i do think it was one of the best
produced pieces of quality work in the
last several years
and and you know but then he got kind of
ignored you know
the amazon pulled it and didn't get much
attention
and and now but his power just keeps
growing it's just so yeah
every day it's just a little bit more a
little bit more and today you
you know you put on the news and the
news is basically the news he created
he actually created the news so epstein
is trending
cernovich made it happen um and it's
just
it's just glorious watching it so uh but
what what is interesting about this
story are several things
one of them is how the news is covering
it
i recommended that you all follow a a
new
uh it's a startup and news startup
called the ground news so ground like
the ground that you stand on
news and what they do is they monitor
all the left and right and center
news sources and they give you a graph
that shows you
who's covering what stories and you'll
see that on a story like this
every well most of the news entities
that are right-leaning
have covered it because bill clinton is
named
in the epstein files so the right
completely covered it and then you see
the graph that i tweeted you can look at
it yourself
that the left is just empty
it's empty it's a big story that's
embarrassing to bill clinton
and the entire left media bubble
ignored it it's completely empty and
when you see it
so so stark you understand the
the bubble situation there's nobody that
i know on the left who will even really
be
aware of this maybe they just sort of
won't even know it exists
so what do we make of the new
information we have well there'll be
more stuff
dripping out but here are some of the
highlights number one
apparently the fbi and i haven't dug
into the details but i'm just
reading twitter summaries of this
apparently the fbi
was aware of more victims of epstein and
did not
interview them all before they
made whatever deal they were making with
them which indicates that the fbi
maybe did not want to prosecute him so
much
which no matter what you thought about
the fbi before
as in are they trying to overthrow the
united states
get rid of the legally elected president
with their
with their russia collusion hoaxes no
matter what you thought about them
before
this is maybe a little worse because it
does look like the fbi
and again you can't you can't make a
definitive claim about anybody at the
fbi doing anything specific
but the way it looks is that the fbi
was complicit in allowing a serial
pedophile to operate
or at least give them a an easier way
out
and they got a lot of explaining to do
that's a lot of explaining
i don't know where that's going to go
keep an eye on that
now the big claim the the big shockers
are the names of people that
uh one of the one of the young women who
was in
the epstein circle there was naming so
she was naming famous people who had
visited the island
her names included uh bill clinton
who she says was on the scene on the
island
uh which he claims he was never on the
island so that's a big big claim
to say that he was on the island that
would directly
contradict everything he's ever said if
true and it said that there were two
young women
there also as well as
uh galen and epstein now there's no
reporting on you know any of those two
young
girls or women i don't know how old they
were um
there's no reporting that they had
specific any kind of contact with any of
those other people just that they were
there at the same time
that's the report the report also says
that uh
tipper and al gore were on the island
and here's the funniest one
matt groening the creator of the
simpsons
now uh here's what you need to know
dershowitz who also has been dragged
into these allegations of various times
is tweeting today that he wants to make
sure that
even more stuff is unredacted because
his claim is this
that the the woman woman or girl who is
making the claims about who was on the
island the famous people
that she has already been proven to be a
liar
and i believe that one of the examples
is that there's some proof that
al and tipper gore were never on the
island now that's a very specific claim
she's made
that al gore and his wife
were on the island i believe and you
i need a fact check on this but i
believe that dershowitz claim
is that that can be definitively ruled
out as untrue
now if that's true that it's untrue
that also means that anything else this
witness says
about who is on the island has no
credibility at all
if you can take somebody as important as
al gore
claim they were on the island and then
prove it didn't happen
uh it kind of makes all the rest of them
go away or at least in a legal sense it
would if not
if not a common sense way so
uh dershowitz is he looks pretty
confident
that uh and i think there are other
documents that have already proven that
the gores were not there
so he's pretty confident that if it's
fully disclosed you're going to find out
that that wasn't true now if it's not
true that the gores were on the island
would you believe that bill clinton was
on the island you shouldn't
all right now uh let me give a
full full disclosure i've never liked
hillary clinton
and i didn't think she would be good for
the country but i've always kind of like
bill clinton
and while i will never excuse anything
he's done in his
let's say semi-private life
i also don't tend to judge my leaders
by that standard because i see them as
employees
and if my employee gets my job done
his personal problems are between him
and the legal system and anybody else
you know i just don't like to make
everybody's problems all of my problems
you know if you can if you get the
economy up and
things are going so i applied the same
standard to bill clinton when he was
being
impeached that i did with trump which is
i'm not supporting any of that whatever
you're saying he did that's between you
and him
and your conscience and the law and i'm
just out
you know that's just not my deal so i'm
not
anti-bill clinton so
that's just full disclosure so you know
where my my uh where i'm coming from
i would say that the odds are that there
is not a credible
information that bill clinton was on the
island because the only person claiming
it
appears to be have no credibility at all
based on the al gore thing being wrong
if it's wrong now her other claim is
that matt greening
the creator of the simpsons was on the
island
now if al gore was not on the island
it's there's a pretty good chance that
the
the matte graining part is completely
made up too we don't know yet we'll wait
and find out
could be never know but i was
imagining matt greening's day
imagine if it were true and i think it's
sketchy to think that this is true
but imagine if matt grayning knew all
along
that he had been to the island and he
was just waiting for somebody to find
out oh my god
oh my god oh let me give a clarification
the there is confirmation that bill
clinton was on
epstein's plane so that part nobody's
arguing about
so the flights are definite the only
question was
was he ever physically on the island
which he claims specifically
he never was and i think he claims he
was never at any of the epstein
properties
uh just to clarify thank you um but i
was imagining that grading and waking up
this morning it's like
oh
get my coffee let's see how today's
looks kind of sunny out today good day
coffee is good i'll check the news
uh-oh that's how matt green's day
probably went today
so um i don't know matt greening
personally he did send me once a
uh a nice note when the dilbert
tv show was on he sent my producer a
nice note
um complimenting it and so i have a good
feeling about matt groening and i hope
that none of this is true
and i hope that uh i hope he i hope he
does well but
it's hard not to imagine that scene of
him waking up to the news
like well what's going on uh i've been
allegedly on
epstein's island rao
okay um
so lots more on that congratulations
mike cernovich for for all of that
um are you seeing
more and more pushback to the teachers
unions
or is that my imagination i don't think
it's my imagination
so i've declared war on the teachers
unions
and here's the logic to it the most
important thing in the country is
national defense would you agree i mean
assuming that we can eat
national defense is probably number one
because you've got to get that right
before you can get anything else right
now national defense
is somewhat interchangeable with
economics
meaning that if you have enough money
you can actually
you don't even need an army if you have
enough money you can bribe people you
can make deals with them
you can make them happier to do business
with you than to conquer you
so money and economics are very
i'm sorry economics and the military
are kind of substitutes and you need
lots of money
to have a really strong military so if
you say
well we'll concentrate on the military
but not the economy
well you're doing it wrong because
that's not a thing
you have to have a strong economy
they're connected
the other thing that's connected is our
education system
there's no such thing as a strong
economy with a weak education system
that's not a thing
can't be a thing so if you don't have
your education system right
you don't have your economy right and
then you can't have national
security right so i would argue that we
should strongly consider
using some kind of national security
executive order or national security
imperative to overrule
some powers that the teachers unions
have because apparently
they're one of the biggest obstacles to
really everything
because at the moment the biggest
obstacle to reopening the schools
which is a challenge to the economy
which is a challenge to national
security
it our entire standing in the world
is now at risk to some radicals and
teachers unions
who are who are demanding things like uh
defunding the police
before they go back to teach this is
crazy stuff
but beyond that it's much much deeper
because the teachers unions are the the
force that keep
um schools from having as much
competition as they could
from firing bad teachers to get better
ones in there really
all forms of change are limited by the
by the teachers unions and that is a
critical problem for the country the
teachers unions
are an extinction risk to the united
states
it's that bad that's not hyperbole the
teachers unions are an extinction
risk to the republic
you know the the physical land will
still be here
but the republic can't stand
as long as the teachers unions remain in
their current form
it just can't happen and so we have to
start being
smarter and tougher about what we think
about
protecting the country if you want to
protect the country
you're going to have to defeat the
teachers unions you're going to need to
do it quickly
i think it needs to happen before the
end of the year
so before the end of the year if we
haven't dismantled the teachers unions
we're not getting off to a good start
and china is going to have a big
advantage there so
i'd like to see some kind of executive
order to
i don't know exactly what it would take
either to limit their power
there's there's at least one movement
that i don't know too much about but i'm
going to look into it
there there's some legal precedents that
would allow union members to stop paying
dues but to still be in the union
have you heard of that so apparently
that's a thing but i don't know the
details yet
so there are some teachers unions in
which the teachers themselves are
organizing to discontinue paying dues
but still remain in the union because if
you take the money out of the union
then the union leaders don't really have
a reason to be there
you know they don't have a reason to to
do whatever they're doing
if you strip the money out of them it's
going to reduce their power
so that effort is going ongoing so that
you'll see grassroots movements to
defund
the teachers unions but i think we need
something from the top
because to me this is a
commander-in-chief decision
literally a commander in chief decision
there there are two areas where i think
the commander-in-chief decision
has to be central one is this
uh because if you're looking at national
defense you can't look at it as a
as a one to five year situation if
you're looking at national defense you
have to look at it as
a hundred year plan right i mean if you
don't have a hundred year plan
for your you know your uh your country
you're not doing it right you should be
looking at all the things you need to
get going
to be as safe as possible in the future
so the school system has got to be
number one
right maybe not actually the other one
might be number one
the second one is nuclear energy and the
argument is not
just about powering you know current
stuff on earth
the argument is that nuclear power is
what will
what will power space
exploration spaceships space colonies
whoever owns space will own the earth
so if we're not building a robust
best-in-class nuclear energy industry on
in this country to handle all of the
nuclear energy issues both domestic
military and space which is also
military in part
if we're not doing all of that and we're
not the number one country
in that whoever is will own space
and whoever owns space
owns it all because you know the high
the high ground is going to be
incredibly important for any
military and also resources because
apparently the the rare resources from
asteroids etc
are are just insanely valuable
so commander-in-chief
needs to work against school unions and
education in general just to make that
as powerful as possible
i think the entire education system
needs to be rethought from the ground up
to make it something that works in the
modern world
because i don't think there's anybody
who would disagree that the things that
are taught in school
are not the things that a modern student
needs to learn
you know some are but a lot of it is you
really
you would probably change 40 percent of
what the kids learn
to to get to where it needs to be for
the modern world
all right so that's it teachers unions
gotta go uh there's a decision in this
michael
brown death from six years ago in
ferguson
and the officer darren wilson will not
be prosecuted
because the more they looked into it and
i guess they've been looking into it for
a long time
and i think it's worth noting that the
prosecutor who is dropping the case is
black
because that's the world we live in
where you have to mention that
because that's part of the story
and they can't find evidence
sufficient that would say that that this
was a crime as opposed to a
tragic incident now if you don't know
this already the same thing is going to
happen with george floyd
so the longer that case goes the better
we are as a country
you know with it would be good to the
george floyd thing
if we could stretch that out four or
five years that would help a lot
because if tomorrow we find that the
police were arrested in his uh in his
death
uh if we find out tomorrow that that
case gets dropped
oh my god the whole country's gonna burn
and i think it will
so we're in this weird situation where
these police officers who
i'm not going to say they did the best
job they could do because i don't know
i just i just don't have the skills to
evaluate it and i don't think i have
enough information about really what was
happening on the ground
but if it's true as i've heard in one
one report that um that george floyd had
in him
three times the amount of fatal fentanyl
that you would basically three times
more than an overdose amount
the claim not confirmed but the claim
is that george floyd was a dead man
walking before the police even touched
him
in other words there was nothing they
could have done to save his life
and nothing they did that changed
whether he lived or died
because he was a dead man and he was
going to die in the next few minutes
from the fentanyl in his body i'm a bit
of an expert on this my stepson died the
same way
and if that's true
and he had some other stuff in there too
but if that's true
i just can't see any scenario in which
the police officers are charged
with the worst of the crimes they might
be charged with i don't know
you know not doing enough to to save
them or something
but i don't think there's any chance
that they're going to be charged with
killing them
so i you should get ready for that sorry
might be a little more blood coming out
of my nose for a day or two
um molly hemingway
had this comment about the washington
post
on twitter she said that fascinating
that the washington post
frets that the truth coming out about
the russia collusion hoax against trump
would impact an election when as she
points out the russia collision hoax
that the washington post perpetuated
dramatically helped democrats in the
2018
midterm election now i don't know if you
can uh
if you can directly say that one issue
caused
the 2018 midterm result
but it was a big one you know it was
maybe the biggest one
so um
this it's just funny that
you know the washington post having
completely you know been involved in
basically a coup against the united
states in effect
because their reporting supported a hoax
that was a coup against the united
states
and in my opinion uh and now they're
complaining that the
truth coming out about the hoax if it
comes out before the election might
affect the election
and i'm thinking to myself i think i'd
want it to affect the election
is that the whole point the whole point
of knowledge and information and data
and finding out what's real and what
isn't
isn't the whole point of that to affect
the election
i mean even if that's not the intention
you hope that it does
all right that
is i think what i wanted to talk about
today
knowledge is power you were right all
right um
somebody says somebody else is reporting
that hydroxychloroquine
is effective well we shall find out i
was watching that uh
one of the doctors the front line
doctors a the
uh the woman who was not the nigerian
doctor
uh she got fired for appearing and
talking about hydroxychloroquine
so that's not good but i did listen to
her arguments and i gotta say i'm still
50 50.
i'm still 50 percent on the uh
whether hydroxychloroquine is a game
changer or not
um i'm seeing another tweet that kanye
is
dropping some some good tweets so i'll
go change that
yes simone gold dr simone gold
is her name all right um
please stream on youtube too somebody
says
um well i i post on youtube an hour
later so you can see it there an hour
later
but um youtube demonetizes me
so i'm not pro youtube so youtube
monetizes two different ways one is
subscription
people people who pay a subscription to
nazi ads
so i'll get a small percentage of that
based on how many people watch the views
but they usually demonetize me
for advertising which
it would be tempting to blame youtube
for that but their business model is
that
advertisers themselves specify who they
want to be associated with
and if they if they don't want to be
associated with a certain kind of
content
it's really not up to youtube they kind
of have to serve they
serve their customer
um yeah the her
the herman cain i'm not going to comment
on herman cain
or john lewis in part because i didn't
know much about either one of them
and i have nothing nothing bad or good
to say
of any value so it's something that
happened
it's just not my beat
uh somebody says get on locals
i am on locals uh i think you may be
talking to the person who asked the
question though
so my content also goes on the locals
platform
subscription service any of you who want
to support
what i do and see more of it that would
be the place to go
and so locals is my locals is what
allows me
to say the things in public that you
wish you could say
but you can't so this is the way to look
at it the reason that i'm on
these free public services so you can
get this content for free
but i'm also on a subscription service
like who who would pay
for things they could get for free well
what for one thing i have
maybe twice as much content on locals
you don't get to see the you know half
of it so
if it's more provocative i'll keep it
there some things a little more personal
in some cases but
but basically it's everything you see
publicly
plus some good stuff but the the real
reason
that anybody should be a subscriber to
that
is because that allows me to say
in the non-subscription services
anything i want
that is you know reasonable and and not
trying to be harmful
so my freedom of speech
is entirely dependent on the fact that i
have a safe space to go to
locals that if i get completely canceled
off the main platforms
i'm still going to be okay you know i've
got like a
little bit of a fall back there so that
gives me the freedom
to to push it as far to the line of
cancellation
as i can always trying to be good
intentions
always trying to be good intentions if
if you're new to me
uh let me tell you that the part of my
life
where i was just selfish and trying to
get what was good for me
and and i think every young person
should think that way they should be
building their own
their own you know wealth and family and
taking care of their personal business
but when you reach a certain age and if
you've had some good
luck in life you there's sort of a
natural transformation to being more
outwardly focused after i got
divorced from my first wife i felt
myself sort of
disconnected from my personal
my personal life really and i
i made a promise so this was years ago
and i promised that from that day on
that i belong to the world so when
you're married your first you know you
belong to your
your little family situation now
christina is an extraordinary
uh woman and she being married to her is
is is wonderful first of all so if you
didn't know i just got married
and uh so
with her i can maintain
um you know full marriage but also be
externally focused
because she came to me when i already
was so she knows exactly who i am
so she's not trying to change me when
she met me
i was already completely externally
focused so
my mission from now until you know my
organic body leaves this earth and maybe
after who knows
is to is to make the world better
specifically the united states
and i think that helps the world and i'm
involved in
a whole bunch of different ways to do
that and i look for areas in which my
special blend of skills can can make a
difference
but i don't have any bad intentions if i
tell you i want to decouple from china
it's not because i hate china even
though i do
it's because it's good for us and it's
going to be good for the world in the
long
in the long term so if you're wondering
what i mean what's my secret intention
what's my
you know what's my game what's my scam
what's my grift
it's all the same for the last 10 years
i belong to the world all right that's
it
and that's my message for today
