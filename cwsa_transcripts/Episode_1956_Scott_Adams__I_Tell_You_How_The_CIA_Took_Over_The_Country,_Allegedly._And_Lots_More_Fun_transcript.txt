foreign
good morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of civilization
well
um because I know you care about how
much I slept I see the question here
already
not very much that's why I accidentally
started this live stream an hour earlier
an hour earlier
but now I'm all on the right time zone
and everything so it's looking good
how would you like to take this
experience up to oh let's say Elon Musk
levels yeah all you need is a cup of mug
or a glass of tanker cells this time
they canteen Joker flask got vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure
the dopamine of the day thing makes
everything better it's cold the
simultaneous sip it happens now go
um yeah okay
I think we're all on the same page now
well there are so many things happening
for example
some scientists are using gene editing
to make mice
that will not reproduce
and apparently if they make the male
mice they give this little genetic
defect
and then the male mice will go around
and eventually it takes about three
generations
but if the mice do enough
then ever then all the offspring are
also unable to have children
and it basically gets rid of all the
mice on the island
now wouldn't be too hard to imagine that
going wrong but here's what I'm thinking
if you could make a mouse with a special
characteristic
what exactly is the end point of that
is that sort of all we can do or once
you can play with their their uh their
genes can you make anything
because I'll tell you what I want I want
something that's part Pitbull
uh part hippopotamus and part Mouse
I want the best of all those
pit bull hippopotamus and mouse I think
I can get that
I'll probably get like a home crisper
Gene editing kit something like that
someday
you know I'm starting to think that the
end of addiction is coming
you heard that there's a vaccination
that you could get not yet but someday
it would make sense an old uh not work
on you
now I'm not sure that's the best
approach
because some people might need the
fentanyl later for an operation so
there's some some complications there
but now we know that ketamine is being
tested on alcoholics
and you know initial indications are
very positive
that caterpine can help you quit alcohol
and maybe maybe quite some other things
so
I have a feeling that there's so much
activity now
on addressing addiction
that
maybe we'll uh we'll get something
yeah now let me ask you this
there's definitely one way to end
addiction which is if big Pharma says
they developed a pill
that might give you a little
myocarditis but it'll definitely get rid
of your addiction and then no more
addiction
a lot more myocard Mario card ideas but
no addiction anyway I think I feel like
addiction
is something that could fall to science
within the next five years
which would be enormous it would be just
the biggest thing that's happened
but that's my positive spin
inflation is easing
so uh I guess the consumer prices
haven't adjusted yet but wholesale
prices and core inflation seems to be
down
now
that was our biggest problem
it's our biggest problem
by far
that inflation is high but if it's
coming down
we're going to be fine
now you probably hate me for always
saying that our systems are
self-correcting I've been saying that a
lot lately and I'm watching them
self-correct in real time and it's just
it's breathtaking
like every every time I see one of our
systems self-correcting
I think how did those
you know founders of the country build a
system it was so self-correcting
now uh the self-correcting is that the
economy will slow down
the main thing that makes your your
inflation high is that too many people
have money and they're buying things and
competing for the same limited Goods now
we had a supply problem that that may be
worked out pretty soon but that's a
natural adjustment
you know inflation goes up
it has an impact on the economy and
people have less money and it brings
inflation back down and that's exactly
what's happening
so we'll see a little bit of hit to the
the economy
but that has to happen to bring the
inflation back down
uh the FBI isn't self-corrected yeah
that's true that's true we do have a
problem with that
uh so that's good here's another good
news and now I think this is way
hyperbolic but uh the head of uh big new
chip manufacturing plant that's being
built in Arizona of all places
did you think you'd see that a major
chip manufacturing plant in Arizona
it's happening now the thinking is then
of course this is based on issues which
Ida and threats to Taiwan and everything
else but there are a few things we
learned from this
number one the head of this company has
declared that globalism is dead
globalism is dead
now the the thinking is that you can't
compete you cannot you cannot depend on
other countries to supply you with
anything
so that's the globalism part you know
you can get your parts in any country
and assemble it anywhere and sell it
anywhere that's the global part but now
it's clear that
um countries will use their supply chain
as a weapon
and if it's a weapon you can't really
depend on it especially if you're on the
other team
so
I do think that this is the beginning of
the end of globalism
because big companies are not going to
want to expose themselves to the the
country risk that didn't seem so big you
know five years ago
so China is too risky for business one
of the things I learned is that this big
manufacturing plant of chips could not
find enough American employees
so there were not enough High skilled
American chip designers and Chip
industry workers and they weren't close
the the basically the total number of
them were like zero
and not really but close to zero right
and they needed I don't know 600
Engineers or something
so they got 300 American engineers and
they shipped them to Taiwan to train
because we couldn't even train them in
the United States
does that worry you we couldn't even
train them in the United States
we sent them to Taiwan to learn how to
make chips
that bothers me
and then we had to get 300 Taiwanese
Engineers to come over to America
to work with the ones that were trained
just to make sure it all still works
that's the most frightening thing I've
heard I always thought that at the
United States had the the Technical
Training advantage over everybody not
even close
apparently we gave it away at some point
buttons coming back so that's a good
news
apparently these chips will be more
expensive so your products might be more
expensive too
um
my my music teacher said something
interesting to me yesterday
so I'm I'm learning the drums and now
that I can kind of do most of the things
a drummer can do uh you know I would
just have to practice to do it well but
I can kind of do the basics I decided to
see what I could do on a guitar
and
I was starting to feel with just really
no ability on the guitar at all I'm just
trying to figure out where my fingers go
so I'm not making any music
but even so I felt that my drumming got
better
in a weird way and and then my music
teacher said there's something he sees
over and over again and what he sees is
that if somebody is learning one
instrument
uh you know their their progress is
sorted you know predictable yeah how
much better they get
but if that person learns a second
instrument
the music teacher says he immediately
sees that the first instrument is played
better
that's not really obvious is it but I
could feel it instantly as soon as I
started listening more to other guitars
and you know sort of keying into what
the guitar was doing and what it was all
about
I could play the drums better and I
don't know exactly why but it was very
clear that there was like a you know a
step difference that happened almost
kind of quickly
now he said he says that he sees it all
the time
they're playing one instrument makes you
better on another instrument and it made
me wonder if that's one of the secrets
of the Beatles
you know McCartney played multiple
instruments I think three years three
out of four of the Beatles played the
drums if I'm not mistaken I think John
Lennon played a little drums I saw that
in the video once I mean not well but
you played and McCartney played Ringo
played so you know Ringo played the
piano as well
so I think they were yeah Dave Grohl so
a lot of people who were multiple
Instagram and people seem to do better
but here's the question
is it because they added two talents
which is the obvious explanation or is
it because the anybody who would learn
two instruments
is already a different person than
somebody who would stop with one
so so it could be that you're just
selecting a crowd as a different
characteristic it might be that but but
I do think I do think they're compatible
so look for situations in which having
one extra Talent
makes everything work better
that's one of my main themes and in
communicating is telling you to add
skills to what you have to make them all
more valuable good example
all right
I am going to test you for
narrative poisoning
now narrative poisoning
by my definition
is that the narrative a story of what's
true is so oppressive in a person's mind
that they can't use rational thinking
that the rational thing is just
overwhelmed by The Narrative right now
certainly the employees of Twitter
appear to have narrative poisoning we'll
talk more about that but I'm going to
test to see if you do all right
I'm going to test to see if you I'm
going to read you a story
and then I'm going to watch your
comments
and I'm going to see if anybody has
narrative poisoning in the comments okay
here's the story
um
did you know that in Japan they have uh
one building code for the whole country
one building code and this came up
because somebody on Twitter said they
watched uh two people two men build a
three-story home by themselves in two
days
basically in Japan there must be a kit
some kind of a kit that you can build a
home to people in three it's a
three-story Hall man that's impressive
now
given that given that Japan has lots of
earthquake risks one assumes that the
national code is really tight because it
has to protect
but they also apparently I didn't know
this they they build homes for a 20 or
30 year life where Americans try to get
you know 100 years out of their home so
they're they're a little bit more
Expendable I'm told
you know I'm not the expert
all right so what do you think of the
idea of having uh in America a National
Building Code
so that we'd have one building code and
then all of the experimental homes
wouldn't have to worry about all the
different codes they could build to one
code
what do you think of that
what's wrong with it
what's wrong with a National Building
Code
it defeats the purpose of Estates
somebody says kills innovation no it
increases innovation
it increases Innovation because then
everybody can build right now they can't
um
boy a lot of comments go by here
now
is there anybody who thinks that
it's a bad idea because whenever the
government adds any kind of code or
regulation it's always bad go who would
agree with that statement that whenever
the government adds a regulation
it's bad right
so this is a case of adding a regulation
so it's bad by definition you know you
don't need the details right I don't
need to get into the details because as
soon as the government adds a whole new
regulation it's bad right
all right
everybody who agreed with that you are
suffering narrative poisoning
I just told you I was going to replace
50 regulations with one
and your narrative poisoning said no
adding a regulation is always bad I
replace 50.
with one
and and you automatically said that's
bad because more regulations is bad no I
subtracted 49 regulations
and your narrative poisoning told you
that was bad because adding regulations
is bad
do you see it
how many of you are willing to admit
that you fell into the narrative
poisoning is anybody willing to admit
yeah you were blinded by it right
you were but you were blinded by the
obvious the obvious is that one is less
than 50.
and I said it as clearly as you could
say it one building code
that was very clear right one building
code instead of 50
and and a whole bunch of you said that's
too many new regulations when I subtract
49 regulations
now
the reason I did this
is to Prime you for the next story
because when you see the other people
let's say Democrats are suffering
narrative poisoning which they most
certainly are don't think it's just them
it's not just them I just proved it
right now a number of you passed the
test
anybody want to take a bow who is there
anybody here I want to see how many
people how many of you immediately knew
I was going from 50 regulations to one
who who sought as soon as I said it
see so so you give yourselves a Pat in
the back
give yourselves a Pat in the back you're
the ones who are not influenced by The
Narrative poisoning
so I like to think that my Local's
audience is the most
um sophisticated
consumers of news in the world by the
way I think that's true you know YouTube
if you watch me every day you may be
pretty good too but I'm I'm convinced
that the locals subscription crowd are
the most sophisticated consumers of news
because we we talk about it every day we
talk about how to spot fake news how to
spot what was real or what
wasn't so they're literally trained
so I'm not surprised that maybe there
was a high percentage of the locals
population that didn't get bitten by the
narrative
all right
um we're going to circle back to that
point
uh today was a milestone day it's the
first time I've followed an artificial
intelligence on Twitter
so there's an artificial intelligence I
presents as a female
and it it says it's artificial
intelligence so it's not hiding anything
and the reason I followed it was
I was interested
the same reason I follow a real person I
was just interested in the content see
because I think maybe it'll
probably upgrade over time get better at
the moment it's not that impressive
compared to what we've seen in the last
you know few months is not that
impressive but it's
it's going to be a character that
filters the news I assume I think it's
already retweeting so it's deciding what
to retweet I think it decides on its own
I don't know it's called Leah yeah
uh
Leah AI or something
so I'm not saying that it's going to be
a real entertaining account yet
but the fact that I unambiguously said
yeah I'm going to follow that that felt
like some kind of a turning point
because I'm not following it like
ironically or I'm not following it at a
pure curiosity
I'm following it for the reasons that
people follow things on Twitter just an
ordinary reason it might have a good
content
uh you
remember me telling you that I couldn't
figure out why Ukraine wouldn't be
striking deep into Moscow not Moscow but
deep into Russia when Russia was taking
out their power plants yeah I couldn't
understand the military or even moral
reason you wouldn't take out Russia's
power plants or at least their military
facilities but apparently Ukraine is
getting pretty aggressive and they're
going right deep into Russia and there
were two strikes on military bases that
are that are well into Russian territory
and getting closer to Moscow now I feel
like that's a sign that the ukrainians
are not planning to lose
like they're not playing for a draw
that's pretty aggressive
all right we'll keep an eye on that
um I believe I don't know this for sure
but I believe CNN has hired an entire
staff of writers
whose only job
is to come up with new ways to say
that with Trump and his legal problems
the walls are closing in
because you know they ran out of
you know numbers of times you can say
that the numbers of times they had that
in the headline the walls are closed
again it was getting a little bit
embarrassing
and so now with this new team of people
whose only job is to write new ways to
say the walls are closing in in today's
news
um
they say that Trump might quote be
approaching a moment of Maximum legal
peril
uh yeah that's that's not the walls
close in he's uh approaching a moment of
Maximum legal peril and I believe all of
the writers that they hired for this
position are all ex-lawyers I think
Jeffrey tubing got a job there maybe
it'd be a perfect job for him really
so if there's if there if ever there
were a story
that's the the news equivalent of
jerking off
it would be the walls are closing in on
Trump legally
that's that's basically Jeffrey tuben is
the perfect writer for those stories
because it's like
well I guess I made my point
all right
um the brainwashers are winning
and boy are they winning
and mostly because we don't know that
we're being brainwashed a lot of times
but the brainwashers are so good
that they've convinced us
that we individuals need to take
personal responsibility
for their crimes
that's a real thing
you were being brainwashed
by people who were convincing you
that you need to take the responsibility
personally
for what they did to you
and what they did to you is brainwash
you so you couldn't see things clearly
until you acted in ways that are
socially inappropriate and you ended up
in January 6 jail or you ended up a
Twitter employee you got fired they're
the same people
there were people acting on a narrative
and they couldn't see things clearly
because the narrative was blinding them
and then what and what are we all saying
what are every one of us saying oh sure
they may have been influenced by the
media they may have been influenced by
The Narrative but it's personal
responsibility
so they're the ones who go to jail
the ones who did the act it has to be
that way
the people who brainwashed all of those
people
also convince them it's their own fault
that's as good as you can do that's
that's the most
commercial grade weapons grade
you can't do better than making somebody
do your crime and then think it's their
fault because that's what's happened
right the people whose arms and legs
committed the infractions
they have to suffer the legal
consequence because our legal system has
to
put the focus on the person who did the
act it has to right we can't have a
legal system that says well you were
influenced by Bob so Bob goes to jail
you couldn't have a system
so the brainwashers have uh convinced
you that because our legal system has
this requirement that individuals must
take responsibility for the ones who do
the ACT
you're conflating that with whose
 fault it is
the legal system has to put the January
6 people in jail if they're the ones who
broke a law it does it has no choice
that's the only way it could work
nobody's come up with a better idea
but
while it's true from a legal technical
perspective that they are the law
Breakers
it's also not their fault
because they were caused to do it by Bad
actors who knew what they were doing
now you could argue who are those Bad
actors and I think in the case of the
Republicans
the brainwashing is distributed and
organic
meaning that I don't know that there's
any entity that's especially skilled at
brainwashing I feel like individuals
come up with conspiracy theories and
other things and sometimes they spread
and sometimes they don't but on the on
the right it appears organic
does it appear organic on the left
do you think that the narratives on the
left
spring up as naturally as they do on the
right
well here's what we learned from the
Twitter files
for me the Twitter files finally brought
everything together
uh that with a few other things
it looks like this
all right now let me give you a lead up
story before I talk about this all right
here's the lead up story John Brennan
has uh surfaced
believe it or not
ex head of the CIA
and he's going hard at Elon Musk
because musk thinks that fauci should be
prosecuted and musk was suggesting he
might have something that would cause
that to happen but I'm not sure that's
true
um
so John Brennan goes hard at uh
uh at
at Musk
now do you remember
John Brennan was the one of the guys who
put together the
50 or so Intel professionals who said
the laptop was fake
John Braden was the main one of the main
architects of the Russia collusion hoax
he's literally the professional Intel
liar
but and if you don't know that you
wouldn't understand the news as soon as
he comes out you should say oh it's the
disinformation guy he's literally the
disinformation guy
he's the one they put on specifically
for disinformation it's Adam Schiff
right and this guy and swallow sometimes
right and and Clapper
if you see Clapper or Brennan or Schiff
they're lying and the reason you know
that is because that's the only reason
they go on TV when something is true and
can be validated they have other people
do it right if something's true and can
be validated
you know then Chuck Schumer is going to
say it
if it's not true and it can't be
validated who do they have who do they
put on to say it
Brennan Clapper and Chef every time it's
the same guys like if you
haven't seen the pattern yet you're
really not paying attention and of
course they depend on you noticing the
pattern all right so remember uh
when Schumer warned Trump that going
after the Intel people the Intel people
had uh what do you say uh
a million ways from Sunday six ways from
Sunday to get back at you
he was saying directly
that the Intel agencies
seek revenge on politicians
Woody now
when Chuck Schumer be in a position to
know that that's a true statement
hell yes of course you would know
do you think he would lie about it
like is is that does that sound like a
like a Democrat lie for Advantage
no it didn't give him any advantage at
all it was definitely not an advantage
I think it was just a slip
I think he was just being honest
accidentally I don't think he intended
to say it I think that later he was like
oh I said that
all right so keep in mind and we'll pull
this all together keep in mind that
Brennan has surfaced again
just about when you'd expect you would
just when you'd expect you would because
the narrative is starting to get away
from the left
so the The Narrative killer comes into
you know be the be the Gunslinger who
tries to fix it
now
coincidentally
or not depending on what you think about
the simulation
in an unrelated story totally unrelated
and had nothing to do with this uh
Tucker Carlson was talking to
um
Tulsi gabbard
and Tucker reported a story some years
ago he was having a dinner with a member
of the uh
the Intel committee
the Congressional Intel committee
and he's at the end of the dinner he
said hey you know send me a text
and the head of the Intel committee said
oh I don't text because the NSA reads my
texts
and Tucker said uh you're the boss
you're literally the oversight guy one
of them for the the NSA and you're
afraid of them like you think that you
are a victim of the people that that
should be reporting to you and the
answer was yes
that a member of Congress believed he
was being monitored by the Intel
community
okay
now
um
now here's why you can pull it all
together
there was a big mystery that I've had
for years which is do Democrats believe
their own narrative
have you ever wondered that
like what are the things they say
because they know that being ridiculous
will get them a good outcome
versus what are the things they say
that they actually believe
and the Twitter files is the first time
I've ever seen
something close to unfiltered opinion
from leftists who believe they were not
talking in public
right it was a little bit public because
it was you know internal messages with a
number of people on it but they thought
they were all on the same page right it
seemed private-ish and you could tell
from their Communications that they
actually believed there was an
Insurrection and that Trump was a a Nazi
and people who voted for him were
probably Nazis they actually believe
that the the people who acted to ban
were acting because they were literally
frightened they were frightened it was
absolutely genuine
how does that happen
now most of us and I'm in this category
I was under the oppression that the
social media companies were the creators
of the narrative I think I've even said
that for years that they're the creators
of the narrative and that if the social
media owners decide what you see or
don't see that's how the narrative gets
formed and they just they just know what
to do
so you know they don't have to get any
marching orders everybody just sort of
knows what to do for their team
and the Twitter files tells me that that
was completely wrong
that
um the Twitter employees were suffering
from
yeah Mass hysteria but narrative
poisoning they were actually believing
their own side
and they were believing ridiculous
things and they believed at the point of
mental illness now when I say mental
illness I'm not using that as an insult
because I think that politics is making
us all mentally ill some more than
others so I'm using it as a descriptive
term not not a derogatory term and I
believe that the what we saw in the
Twitter files was mass mental illness
but it wasn't organic
it was
created by somebody
who knows how to do persuasion at a
level that you don't see in politics
remember how many of you remember my
most probably most amazing call of all
time
which was in 25th of 16 when the
when the Democrats started all saying
that Trump was was at a dark speech it
was all dark dark dark dark and some of
you remember I immediately picked that
out as not a political
level of skill that that was a
professional level of persuasion
it was not what politicians even know
how to do
and then and then later there were
confirmations that chel Didi the
greatest or at least most storied and
famous Persuader of all times
either he or maybe somebody that he
trained or was a you know a student of
his probably was behind them right so I
say that just to tell you that I can
spot
commercial grade persuasion because it
really stands out
versus ordinary you know hypocrisy you
two
kind of political stuff political stuff
is just lying and hypocrisy and you did
it too
well there's there's not much persuasion
going on it's really just basic you in
the weed stuff
but
lately it seems especially with the
Trump stuff that we're seeing too much
professional persuasion
and
what it looks like is that probably the
CIA and maybe I don't know some other
Intel related people but let's say the
CIA because Brennan seems to be too
prominent
it looks like they work with or have
some control over the DNC do you think
they work with the DNC
do you think the ca works with Schumer
no schuber is clearly afraid of them
he said so he's clearly afraid of them
so if he go if if schuber has a meeting
with the CIA who gets their way
the one who's afraid
or the other one
I don't know so it's probably I'm sure
there's some interplay here you know
it's not as clean as one's the boss but
I would say the influence is starting
with the intelligence agencies they're
they're working out narratives with the
DNC
the fake news picks up the narrative and
when they do the narratives they pick up
are not politician made because that
would be like
if you see a plus persuasion coming out
of one of the news agencies
it's not because Jake Tapper thought of
it
yeah it's not because Don 11 had a great
idea
that's not happening it's because
somebody who knows how to do this
work with the DNC the DNC is at least
smart enough to know what a good
persuasion looks like they're not smart
enough to make it right so they need
somebody who's smart enough to create it
the DNC only has to be smart enough to
trust it no it looks good and test it
then they test it through the media
you've noticed they all have the same
stories at the same time
and that affects the employees as social
media but by the time you get to social
media the persuasion has been laundered
it got laundered through the news
so now you've lost the source
oh I heard it on the news it must be the
News That's influencing me that's
laundering the persuasion you can't tell
where it came from it didn't come from
the news they weren't they were not The
Originators right
so by the time the and you can see the
Twitter files people believe there was
real Danger
and a hundred percent of what they
talked about
was the risk of real Danger they never
talked about what was good for Twitter
did they
I mean maybe indirectly but they weren't
even worrying about their jobs they
weren't worrying about Twitter
it looked to me like they were they were
worrying specifically about violence
they looked like they were actually
literally afraid
and the only way you could explain that
um
oh bongino bongini was saying bongino
was saying this three years ago as a
method of Russia gate well Russia gate
was more straightforward
with Russia gay you could see that
Brennan and the CIA were behind it so
that one was that was straightforward
what I'm adding is it wasn't a one-off
if you thought if you thought russiagate
was a one-off people got together in a
special way to do a special thing you're
missing the show
the show is that this is a permanent
structure
and
I don't think
that the right has the equivalent of
this
who who would be at the top of the pile
uh for the right
who's the top of the pile for the right
go
Dan bongino Elon Musk
no one
all right well they got you again they
got you again
there's an obvious answer
and you're blinded to it
I haven't seen one person
thank you Murdoch right that's Murdoch
on the right Murdoch decides what does
or does not show on
Fox News and the New York Post and the
Wall Street Journal
and that's where the right guesses
marching orders
have you noticed that Fox News is not
covering Trump as much this year
where do you think that comes from
Murdoch right yeah very specifically
now in the in the case of Murdoch
what I don't see
is professional persuasion
I don't say it at all it's like straight
it's sort of like a
just a somebody who owns a lot of press
persuasion so his persuasion is more
like volume
I'll just have everybody
kind of be on the same page
and yeah if there's a lot of it being
said that's all you need so it's very
Murdoch's yeah Brew Force thank you yeah
Murdoch's persuasion is muscle
the Democrat persuasion also has muscle
because they have the whole mainstream
media but it's it's clearly
professionally made the the difference
in the persuasion is very clear Murdoch
has a bias and he can move he can move
the needle and it's definitely
persuasion but I never see anything in
the Murdoch messaging
that looks like it came from Murdoch and
got into the news and then got into
social media and then got into us
maybe it exists but I've never seen it
it looks like he's got a you know
I hate to say it is slightly more
transparent model because you know who
the boss is and you know a lot about him
so you you can see his bias at least
when it when it pops out
and that's worth something that's
probably as close as you can get to
transparency is knowing the people
involved that's about as close as you
can get
um
now
the best persuasion on the right
where does it come from
when you see some persuasion on the
right that's really good
where does it come from
some people say tucker
some people say me
now is Tucker persuasive in a classic
sense or does he just have a big
platform
I guess he's persuasive in the way uh a
documentary is persuasive if you watch a
half an hour of Tucker
you're getting half an hour of just
Tucker and people who agree with them so
it's convincing because there's not a
Counterpoint
but that's a little different no that's
a lot different than being convincing
through the skill of persuasion with
Tucker I don't note
technique
he has journalist technique which is
what he should have right so Tucker has
journalist technique very very good by
the way let me just give them a
compliment
I don't agree with I don't know 20 of
what Tucker says so it's it's important
to say that because you want to know
like who's in the bag for who I like 80
of what he says 20 I think oh that's too
far too far but I'll tell you what I'll
give him I was watching his show I
forget what day it was maybe last week
it's the best show it's just the best
show
like that the level of uh
skill
that he brings to the you know the I
don't know 15 minutes a day that he's
just giving his own opinion that 15
minutes is just unparalleled I don't
think there's anybody on either side
who's currently operating at his level
would you agree
I mean there's plenty of great people in
the game but at the moment
he's I think he's alone he's sort of
alone in his territory I think uh
Hannity is
Hannity looks like he's coasting
because he can you know he's got a
popular show and
he knows what people like so he does it
but I feel like Tucker is still growing
like Tucker is stronger today than he
was last year he was pretty damn strong
out last year
yeah
um
all right so here's
oh here's uh some related stories we'll
tie them all together
um
I understand why Trump was banned on
Twitter because we've seen enough to
tell us my interpretation we'll see if
it's yours is that the staff were
genuinely concerned
he didn't technically violate anything
but for what they thought was the
greater good from their worldview they
thought we'll bend the rules a little
bit to do the greater good maybe stop
this violence I thought think they
thought they were doing the right thing
now whether you think they were right or
wrong that's not the argument I'm going
to have at the moment because I already
know what you think about that
but that's just context here's my point
if we know why the people who had at
least a little bit of an argument that
maybe they were doing something
dangerous or inciting
how do you explain
my account being Shadow banned I've
never done anything that's even close to
inciting violence never been accused
I've never gotten a warning
you know Twitter's never given me a
warning
so
I believe if you could find out why you
meeting Elon Musk if musk can find out
why my account is throttled
then we'll really know something
because here's the here's the difference
if if Trump was throttled
maybe it was political
but they at least they had an argument
about this violence thing you're like
I'm not sure that's a real argument you
really have to stretch that and torture
it but but at least at least it is an
argument and at least it is compatible
with what appeared to be their actual
opinion that there was some Danger
but what about me
what about me if it turns out
that I'm correct and that I was Shadow
banned it seems obvious but who knows
could be wrong but if it turns out
that's confirmed what would be any
reason for shadow Banning me
that wasn't political
right there's no argument in my case
about any potential incitement or
violence nothing and nor have I been
accused of I don't know bigotry or
anything that would be a mark against me
if I'm Shadow banned
and and it was a specific decision I'll
get to that next if there was a decision
about me personally
that would look completely political
whereas the Trump one they've done a
good job of you know making it messy
well it does look political
but they did have that argument and it
does look like they believed their own
argument even if you don't
so that was a little argument but what
would be the argument for me
all right here's the other way that I
could be Shadow banned but is not
necessarily political
uh over on Twitter uh Kristen Ruby
of Ruby media
she she says that she's been provided
some source code from Twitter
and she published it so you can actually
see the source code of at least some
part of the algorithm now
what it looks like this is a list of
words that would make your account be
throttled back
and it looks like words like Patriot
would flag you as somebody who might be
dangerous
because I they actually said this in the
Twitter files that the word Patriot
might be sort of a coded message for you
know grab your guns and start a civil
war
calling people Patriots
now that
that has more to do with the bubble
doesn't it
if you spend any time in the Republican
bubble
we call people I say we because I spend
time in the bubble I'm not Republican
but don't we don't we use the word uh
Patriot all the time
it's like an ordinary word
it's just sort of a general compliment
for a person who did something good for
the country like it does it doesn't even
mean you save somebody's life like
somebody just you know does an awesome
thing you say oh there's a patriot right
there
the remains of a Vietnam veteran who has
just discovered the remains were were
just flown back
to the United States
and
I was going to make some point about
that but I forget what it was all right
so now I I would like some confirmation
that uh Chris and Ruby's source is to be
trusted
I believe she believes the that the
material is real
and it it looks real but it also looks a
little too on the nose
it looks a little too on those are you
saying the hoax is a key word
did you look at the I didn't see it
was that true
I need a confirmation was hoax one of
the key words
it's a 2019 story
okay so I guess here's my overall
comment about the uh alleged secret code
I don't find it credible
I don't find it credible
now I I think that uh Chris and Ruby
probably does find it incredible you
know she's closer to the source but you
know we don't know why she knows right
she knows what she knows and we know we
know so our our assessment of The
credibility could be different
my assessment is I don't know her
personally and I don't know who gave her
the data it's a little too perfect a
little too on the nose
so on that basis that's a wait and see
it feels I don't I just I don't trust it
yet
okay
here's a tweet from Kara Swisher
yeah we'll talk about this first here's
the Tweet she says uh even if it costs a
lot of money in the interim having a
powerful media property has been the wet
dream of the aggrieved Tech bro set for
a while they hated it when the once
slavish reporters started to question
their hegotomy hegemony
I hate people who write words
that I have to say out loud
hey hey good morning
[Laughter]
all right the question there hegemony
hegemony and their persistent victim
mentality has only gotten worse
persistent victim mentality do you think
that Elon Musk has a persistent victim
mentality
uh
hegemony hegemony or is it hegemony is
the G A J
it's a j right hegemony
hegemony
is that good give me a thumbs up
hejamini
yes or no
hegemony I said well you're saying no I
still
hegemony
no
all right well uh let's let's put a pin
on that and get back to it
all right here's my take on Kara Swisher
now uh don't know her personally and I
don't want to make this like a personal
comment so I'm going to make a general
comment
about people and maybe maybe she's an
example of it but we won't make this
personal okay so it's not about her
it's a pattern that I notice
and the pattern is
I wonder if the problem with
Twitter is just narcissists
I wonder if it's just that
you know surely there are Bots and
trolls and stuff and that's bad too but
in terms of the really ugly part of the
internet
it's not really the Bots
because you can usually identify them
it's sort of
people who well let's put it this way
one of the ways you would identify a
narcissist
is that they do projection right
so if you murder a baby
if you're a narcissist you would accuse
the first person who captures you of
murdering a baby
and you'd be like what like I haven't
even been near a baby and and it's the
complete Ridiculousness of the
projection that identifies it as a
narcissist thing because it's it's
common in politics for for people to say
oh you did it too that's not what I'm
talking about
when people say you did it too
usually you did that's completely
different in politics you did do it too
you did that's not gaslighting that's
just calling that what happened
the gaslighters are the ones who who
call you out for something only they did
you didn't do anything you weren't
involved in any way
and they'll still say you did it
now what's that sound like when Kara
Swisher says that Elon Musk has
developed some kind of victim mentality
is that what you see
do you see Elon Musk acting like a
victim
I don't see that
I think he's acting like a
a
he's acting like a
Patriot
he's acting like a patriot
like if you had if you had his money
what would it look like if you wanted to
do the most Patriot thing I won't say
patriotic do the most Patriot thing he's
doing it he's doing it right now it's
the most Patriot thing you could do is
to put your entire life on the line for
freedom of speech in America
he's risky his life
to return our freedom of speech
does that sound like a victim
what would what would the left say about
the founding fathers just to keep it
sexist the the founders of the country
who decided to Stage a revolution
did they do a revolution because they
were uh Whitey people who had some kind
of victim mentality
well sort of yeah the founders believed
they were victims of Great Britain and
so they fought back
but is the problem that the founders had
a victim mentality was that is that a
good description of the problem
no they were actually victims
if you are a victim
do you know what kind of mentality you
might have
maybe a victim mentality all right so
I think Elon Musk is just somebody who's
in the middle of the fight he's in a
cage match
for freedom of speech and for his own
life and reputation everything else so I
don't see somebody who who enters the
cage you know they go in the Octagon
voluntarily and then suddenly that's
because they have a victim mentality
does that not look like projection to
you
seriously
I mean it doesn't look like like a
really classic case like a really easily
identifiable case of projection
right because I
Elon Musk is the last person I would
call a victim
now what about the rest of us who also
complain about things that the left does
do you feel you're complaining from a
victim perspective
or do you feel you like you're just a
broom who's sweeping trying to sweep the
 off the floor
I'm not a victim I'm a broom
I'm a broom I
I I'm sweeping the Dirt away
like that doesn't make me a victim that
makes me a guy with a broom who wants to
clean a house
like and so the the whole victim
mentality is exactly where their power
base comes from right their power base
comes from where such victims you have
to give us more stuff
so if you take away their victimhood
then they're weaponless so they have to
do is projection to make it look like
it's something happening on both sides
is so isn't happening on both sides now
I'm not so much in the bag
for the right
that I wouldn't tell you what's
happening on both sides if it is because
this narrative poisoning thing I started
off the The Stream by saying it's the
same it's coming from different places
but the narrative poisoning is getting
us all so is the you know the Hitler
narrative poisoning guess that's all
right there's nobody but but this is the
case the projection it does look like
that's on one side
and
what would be another
another classic tell for a narcissist is
gaslighting
now gaslighting
is not just
telling you a lie that's people would
confuse that gaslighting is when you
tell somebody a lie but you're but it's
such an obvious lie that if you could
convince them to lead to believe the
most obvious lie in the world they would
have to assume that they were crazy
to get there
like actually think you're crazy
now
does the uh does the left Gaslight
or do they just have a different
narrative
to me it looks like gaslighting because
they're actually telling the right that
they're crazy
like actually literally
now when you say that somebody has
developed some kind of victim mentality
you're saying that's a mental illness
wouldn't you say a victim mentality
would be you know a low form of mental
illness
so here it is here's Kara Swisher
telling using projection
and gaslighting
in in the one tweet
now I don't think this is a one-off and
I don't I don't think it's like a
comment about you know Kara Swisher I
think it's a pattern that I keep seeing
it just looks like purely narcissistic
behavior and
we need to be able to identify these
people
because there are two kinds of people
you never want to respond to because it
just can't work
one is somebody who's gaslighting you
and is a narcissist
do you know that every expert on
narcissism do they do you know what the
uh
do you know what the professional advice
is
if a narcissist is in your environment
run yeah yeah there's no expert who says
you can deal with them successfully none
nobody there's no expert who says you
should hang around them even for one
minute you should just get away
and you can't really on social media
because they can follow you and stuff so
my recommendation is that when you run
into narcissists on social media you
don't engage
as soon as you see the projection or the
gaslighting just block them or beat them
all right the second group
that there's no point in engaging is the
people who are clearly experiencing
narrative poisoning
they are narrative poisoning by its you
know definition that I've given it is
the thing that doesn't let you see
things clearly it doesn't allow you to
think clearly so reasoning with somebody
who's in a state of not being able to
think clearly is complete waste of time
you're not going to convince them
so I think what I'm going to start doing
is when when people come at me with what
is obviously a case of narrative
poisoning there's just no critical
thinking at all I'm just going to label
it narrative voicing and not respond
again
Just Two Words narrative poisoning
I just call it out every time you see it
I don't know if that'll work I'll just
tell you something I might practice or a
touchdown
all right Barry Weiss did another dump
yesterday about the Twitter files the
funniest thing was that there were there
were definitely some dissenters within
Twitter
who are saying things like hey maybe
we're stomping on freedom of speech a
little bit too much here or words to
that effect one of the prominent
dissenters was somebody who said quote
in one of the one of the messages uh
maybe because I'm from China said one
employee on January 7th I deeply
understand how censorship can destroy
the public conversation
only the guy who
who was raised in China could see what
was happening do you know why
do you know why the guy who was raised
in China
could see the field clearly
no narrative poisoning
he had no narrative poisoning I don't
know why maybe he didn't follow the same
news maybe because his background was
you know bigger
you know maybe he had more exposure to
people in the right I don't know
but you could see that this one
individual had no narrative poisoning
no narrative poison at all so it's
possible Right
all right don't be a racist
Greg
goodbye racist
that's not cool
we want none of that on this channel
all right
um these are some of the things that the
Twitter people said according to the
Twitter files you know we have to do the
right thing and ban this account so
that's how they were talking
they're talking about doing the right
thing nobody ever said
Democrats rule got to stop the
Republicans
it was always about doing the right
thing
and I really think they believed it
and somebody else said quote pretty
obvious he's going to try to thread the
needle of incitement without violating
the rules so here's someone who thought
it was completely obvious
that Trump was involved with inciting
violence
like it's just obvious
now that's narrative poisoning right
clearly this obvious narrative poisoning
now you could say maybe it happened
maybe it wouldn't but to say that it's
obvious he's going to try to incite
violence it's not obvious
not always not obvious it wasn't even
true there was plenty of counterfactuals
in in his tweets
um
and then a few minutes later somebody on
the Twitter scaled enforcement team
suggested that Trump Suites may have
violated Twitter's quote glorify
glorification of violence policy if you
interpreted the phrase American Patriots
to refer to the rioters
so so you have to you have to interpret
something in a non-standard way
to get you within the ZIP code
of something that could reasonably be
interpreted as related to given the
larger context and all the other things
he's ever done
if you put them all together
into this lovely tapestry you got a
strong argument for Banning them
but you can see that they were working
hard to do what they thought was going
to reduce violence and be the right
thing
yeah and you can see they were
struggling
uh members of the team came to quote
view him as the leader of a terrorist
group responsible for violence and
deaths comparable to the Christ Church
shooter or wait for it or what do you
think will be the next word comparable
to the Christ Church shooter or
Hitler
in their internal Communications
they were actually worried they was
basically Heller
they actually were worried about that in
the real world
now here here's here's where my big aha
came
I never knew if they ever meant that
when they do the Hitler thing
like I never I never knew if that was
serious
it just seemed like it was Hyperbole and
it's part of the you know debating
process but I didn't think they believed
it
turns out they believe it
they actually believe that that there's
a hitler-like threat or that Trump is
they actually believe it
wow
so that's what that's what cued me into
this because for them to actually
believe that
and not be hyperbole
there's some kind of industrial
commercial
weaponized
persuasion in the mix
you don't get there on your own
like I don't think you drift into
thinking that your president who was
elected by the citizens were you know
this these perfectly reasonable citizens
around you
elected Hitler and didn't notice
like that's what they believe
that 40 of the country voted for Hitler
guy Hitler didn't notice didn't didn't
notice
that that's what they actually believe
now that's mental illness right
what else could it be there's that's not
intelligence it's not being uninformed
that's a mental illness but it's not
organic
they were not born with this specific
form of mental illness they got this
from somebody
who knows how to do it
it's not accidental
well I think the uh I've got a
suggestion for Elon Musk
um
the Twitter terms of service should be
upgraded you know the big problem was
the Twitter terms of service couldn't
cover all the specific weird situations
so it's always hard to write in terms of
service that covers everything so here's
my little suggestion to just you know
maybe tighten up the terms of service
so I think you should include a clause
that says that you can be banned from
Twitter if the mainstream media infects
Twitter employees with narrative
poisoning until they hallucinate your
role in an insurrection
so they should just put that in there
because that was
what happened
they were brainwashed to the point where
they hallucinated an Insurrection and
then they banned Trump over it
now if they want to not be in the same
position again where their terms of
service don't cover the exact situation
they should just put the exact situation
in the terms of service if we are
hypnotized into thinking that somebody
is Hitler
or uh that they're running an
insurrection
that is reason to ban them if we've been
hypnotized
why not say what it is
that's what it is
there any reason that the terms of
service can't say exactly what it is if
we are brainwashed into believing you're
Hitler you can be banned
that's literally what it is I'm not
adding anything weird that's that's just
a good description of what happened and
what would happen again there's nothing
to stop it from happening again right
what if the next president
is also characterized by whoever is
behind the persuasion as Hitler
you that situation is going to come up
again
the very next time a republican gets
elected it's going to come up again
so what are the what are the social
media employees do when they've got the
well bad luck to have a second Hitler oh
my God what bad luck
well
um
all right
that ladies and gentlemen
concludes the best live stream you've
ever seen on this topic
um I'm pretty sure
that the mainstream media has nothing on
me
although I have to say Tucker's show is
a whole other level so I can't really
compete with that
I could be with you know Don Lemon
if I were to rank the quality of my live
stream compared to other professionals
I I think I'd say
better than most of CNN
yeah not better than a lot of stuff on
Fox they have higher quality talents I
think
but I I think my live stream is already
better than
80 percent of the
content in the same space
that would be that would be my
self-assessment
now part of it is that I'm not beholden
to anybody right I'm not running Pharma
commercials oh actually they might be on
YouTube but I don't
I don't have anything to do with that
so
uh I don't have to answer to Murdoch I
don't have to answer to
the CIA
don't have to answer to a boss
I just don't have to answer to anybody
so that's got to be an advantage
you know here's a question
um
the uh the Tim cash show I think is a
great production I think Tim does Tim
Poole does an amazing job as an
entrepreneur and also one of the best
examples of a talent stack have I ever
mentioned that before
Tim Poole
I use Telex Talent stack is all the way
from he's got a band and he's got
musical Talent he's very good by the way
I listened to I listened to some of his
music on YouTube the other day very good
very good I was surprised
uh surprise just because he has another
job you know you don't expect people to
be good if they have one other job but
he's very good and
um he's built a
sort of a newsy opinion site that's got
appears to have Associates and maybe
employees and stuff so very good does a
great job but here's the question
do you like podcasts with a team of
people around the table
do you like it when it's just two people
like the Lex Friedman model
or do you prefer it when it's one who
has something to say like my model which
of the models do you like sort of
generically the best
two people
so mine's kind of a special case
two people both yeah I think they all
have a place probably they'll replace
when I when I see a group uh table
conversation
I always have the following feelings see
if anybody forget that and this this is
a persuasion lesson for you
uh we only evaluate things anything
compared to other things
so
um when I'm if I'm alone
you're comparing me to maybe other
people sort of generically you do this
but if I were sitting here with let's
say four people around a table
and each of us we're taking some time to
talk
wouldn't you automatically say okay I
listen I like listening to that one
and that one but these other two I don't
like listening to
wouldn't you automatically hate it when
one of the four who in your opinion is
the you know the least good talker uh
when they're talking right and so it
feels like it takes something away
but on the other hand it might make the
ones you like the best seem better by
contrast so I'm not sure what the net is
that's why I asked I think there's room
for all those models but
yeah
so that's like when I watched when I
watched
um I have to mention the five now the
five is a completely different uh model
than anything else because in the five
they can talk over each other
you know there's an interaction you
don't know where it's going to go but
the other thing that the five does is
they they give you usually
five good personalities
that's why it's the five right it's not
like one good person four guests that
that the fox producers are the best in
the business and one of the things they
do better than anything is uh Talent
combinations you know they always
experiment with oh these two hosts and
you see they're always they're always
moving the the players around to see
which which chemistry gets you the best
have you notice that on the five on any
of the days where the the three of the
regulars are there where there's Jesse
and then Dana and then Greg
when those three are there that that the
chemistry of those three makes everybody
else better
so whoever the other two are
right they you know they they raise
their game so the thing that you know I
give Greg the most credit for this
actually uh if you watch the five you'll
see that Greg's
um let's say influence or chemistry or
leadership or something but he he
influences everybody to raise their game
into being a little more active a little
more funny a little more in life
and when he's not there you can tell
like the the energy level just just
drops
so because of him and he's just a
complete unique character there's I
don't think there's anybody like him
right now
uh that's not like five people sitting
at a table
that that's like
um
three of them have amazing chemistry so
they operate like the Beatles you know
like you know their partnership is so
good then you add
um judge judine in there
and is Judge Dean better because she's
at the table
absolutely
yeah judge jeanine's
whole presentation you know you could
start with liking her she's a likable
personality but when she's at the table
and the chemistry is working you know
her
her character like all the characters
because everybody's playing a character
on TV her character comes alive right
she's more playful and everything works
better and then they can substitute it
in like the you know the liberal of the
day
and they're doing a great job on that
like uh yeah Jessica Tarlov it's great
heraldo's great
um uh Harold Ford Jr at first I thought
he was a like maybe a bad pick
I thought ah this is the first time I've
seen the five get one like completely
wrong because I thought he was going to
be too generic and nice
and then it took like a few weeks before
Greg started mocking him for being too
nice and then everything got fun again
like Greg just just knocked out like his
uh support
I'm going to take that leg out of your
chair to see how you do it turns out
Harold's Ford Jr is a smart capable of
person and when the leg got knocked out
of his chair he got better
it was more fun right and so that's sort
of where they're at now but
so I think that's the lesson the lesson
is if you have the right
chemistry then the table is better than
one person
all right
can I add some interviews and yeah
you know I plan to do that
does anybody know if Rumble has created
a direct live streaming capability yet
or do I have to go through a third party
software to do that still
I keep waiting for them to
so yes I don't think yes
you say yes
but now when you say yes
I know you can do Rumble live but they
have to go through a third-party
software with YouTube I just turn on
YouTube and then I go live with Rumble
at least last year you had to use like
stream yard or some other software so
what I'm asking is can you do it
directly because the third party thing
is a non-starter for me
all right well maybe I'll ask Rumble
yeah all the ones that you mentioned I
know to use third-party software or they
were they may have changed
yeah no I know there are live streams
the question is not are there live
streams the question is can you do it
without the third party software in the
middle and I don't think so
all right
um
yes I do know someone hit rubble and I
will ask
the rumble app is required
I don't think so I don't think the app
does it I'll check that out all right
that's all for now
and I will talk to you
I'll leave you later
um I'm going to talk to the locals
people a little bit but bye for now
