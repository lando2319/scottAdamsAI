hey everybody i'm glad you got here
early
it's time for coffee with scott adams
probably the best time
anybody's ever had in the history of
human civilization
and it's not going to get any worse
today i mean today it's
might even take it up a level i can't
promise it
but it might go from the best thing ever
to slightly better
not saying every time but very possible
so stay around for that
now i know you want the simultaneous sip
but i have to share a
joke i heard on twitter before we do
that
credit to twitter user dr sexy
s-e-k-z-i who made this joke
uh uh well the context is the jeffrey
toobin situation and now somebody got
arrested for
lube and the tubin in uh times square
and so there were many funny uh tweets
about it
but dr sexy tweeted uh can no longer do
it on the plane
or you might get arrested for
fill in the joke let's see if you're
funny are you funny
you can't pleasure pleasure yourself on
a plane
or you might get arrested for hijacking
i wish i'd thought of that one well if
you'd like to enjoy the
simultaneous sip to its maximum
maximum ability what do you need
that's right you need a copper mug or
glass attack your gel is a steiner
canteen chunk of glass a vessel of any
kind
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better
all over the world at the same time it's
called the simultaneous sip
and mark you made it just in time
hope you have your cup go
now i didn't find my cheat sheet to
remember the simultaneous
sep introduction i actually googled it
and then wrote it down i had to actually
listen to my own podcast
an earlier one and then transcribe it's
like oh
what's the order of that all right well
there's lots of stuff going on
how many of you saw uh tucker carlson
and he was interviewing a gentleman from
revolver
whose name i forgot to write down but i
wish i had
and the gentleman from revolver had
noted that apparently there are many
domestic
uh acts of violence let's call them
terrorism but domestic acts
domestic yeah terror attacks and there's
a weird coincidence
to a lot of them which is there were fbi
informants
or fbi assets maybe is a better word
involved with all of the groups or not
every one of them of course but they
seem to be consistently involved
and the suggestion is that maybe they're
more than just
watching them maybe they're
participating a little bit too much
maybe they're even
prodding people to do something that
they wouldn't necessarily have done
or maybe not done as soon
so what do you think about that we've
got some other evidence
tucker carlson's show talked about
apparently there are some
unindicted co-conspirators
involved in the january 6
let's say demonstration on the capital
and the suggestion is wait a minute why
would somebody be a co-conspirator
and evidently we know who they are but
they would not be
indicted hmm what are the reasons
that somebody would be not indicted well
i'm not a lawyer so
you know if i'm wrong about this
somebody will correct me but it sounds
like one of the reasons
is that they might be an informant or
have some
prior relationship with law enforcement
so that's out there we don't know the
details of that but
something to look at right and
apparently there are as tucker was
saying 10 000 hours of video of the
january 6th event
that's not being made available to the
public but
there's a reason for that no reason
given
maybe one of the reasons is we'd see
something they don't want us to see
i don't know so here's my take on that
um i have a hard time believing that
anybody in the fbi or law enforcement
would talk somebody into doing an actual
terror attack
for what reason i don't know but if
you're talking about the january
6 event which
cnn calls an insurrection
and other people call it a demonstration
of free speech
that went a little too far you somewhere
in between is probably the truth
uh and a little bit closer to the freeze
but since that wasn't really something
that people could have anticipated
being an actual you know a violent thing
where people
died um at least in my opinion
in my opinion i don't think it was
obvious that violence would happen
you know and
maybe there are some law enforcement
related people who had a little bit too
much to do with that
but i think you'd have to put this in
the speculation category
i would love to tell you yeah i'm all
miked
i'm all mike that's why my shirt looks
like this
i'd love to tell you that i'm buying in
totally to the
the fbi is somehow causing
domestic attacks but it doesn't quite
smell right
to me however there are legitimate
questions
and those questions do lean in that
direction there's no doubt about that
but just because we don't know the
answers to why we haven't seen the video
why there are unindicted co-conspirators
that doesn't mean there's one
explanation for it
there could be others and there might be
you know
there might be one or more example of
an fbi agent who did go too far
but i don't know that it's some kind of
pattern
so i'm not going to go that far but i
will say that
tucker laying it out there and revolver
news being the original source of this
um i think this is good work good work
you know don't don't get too far ahead
of the facts
but this is a good frame we should
understand this
um the fact that it looks so damning
that's all that's all you need to look
into it a little further
but uh i'm not quite on the conspiracy
side of this yet
uh do you remember when cnn was mocking
trump when he was president for
the g7 allegedly laughing at him
now i don't know that they really were
laughing at him versus
laughing near him or whatever so i'm not
not even sure it's
real news but let's say it's true
because
cnn made a big deal about it and sort of
mocked the president for that
now sky news in australia if you've seen
this
clip that sky news has been mocking cnn
for basically just not even trying to be
a news network anymore and i think
that's fair
i don't believe you could say that the
point of cnn
is news anymore could you is there
anybody who would
disagree with that statement in the
comments i want to see
how how far you've gone in in
understanding what's going on here
how many people think cnn
is actually trying like legitimately in
their minds thinking we'll
we'll tell the news as objectively as
possible
how many things are even trying to do
that because it doesn't look like
they're trying
does it it doesn't even look a little
bit like they're trying
it looks like they're just a brain as as
as ryan is saying in the comments
it looks like they're just a
brainwashing organization
built around a you know news model and
that's all it is
but apparently sky news in australia is
laughing at them
and they just did a segment showing how
differently they treated trump going to
the g7 versus biden
and it was pretty funny
hey i'd like to give a shout out to
brian machiavelli who reports that he
lost
40 pounds in the last six months now if
you're asking yourself
why am i talking about somebody's weight
loss
the reason is that a lot of people are
reporting
amazing results during the pandemic
and i retweeted brian's success and by
the way brian
congratulations that's really impressive
i gotta say
40 pounds in six months and the before
and after pictures are crazy
mark schneider same thing another these
are two people that i know primarily
from twitter
exchanges and mark schneider same thing
just took the opportunity to turn the
pandemic into a plus
oh my god here are some comments uh
adele
lost 40 pounds johnny lost 30 pounds
uh wow if anybody else 20 pounds
michelle how did they do it well
thank you for asking in brian's tweet
he suggests that people read my book
and failed almost everything and still
win big kind of the story of my life now
the point of the book for those of you
who
shared 20 pounds holy cow
curl this 25 pound oh geez oh this is
crazy
i wasn't expecting this dwayne 50 pounds
and 20 pounds john 60 pounds
uh sam got his dead lift from 250 to 450
holy geesh um
gain needed pounds successfully somebody
gained successfully
matt says he gained 300 pounds but i
don't think i believe that
melanie 40 pounds in eight months
southern guy
30 pounds holy cow tim
35 uh wow
09 25
jack 90 matt 30.
i think these are real by the way i'm
not making this up
uh lose no i'm sorry uh boffin
boffin says he lost 160 pounds in a
divorce
okay that's funny jennifer 30.
wow well keep reading the comments i
won't read all of them but
my mind just kind of boggled so many of
you
might remember at the beginning of the
pandemic i was
trying to find some way to be a helpful
force during a difficult time and i was
recommending that
people took the holy
i'm my mind is just blowing up here
i'm looking at your comments and it's
insane
holy cow wow
i'm just blown away by this keep reading
them as as they go by
um so i had advised people to use the
pandemic
uh as a once in a lifetime i hope
situation where
you would have more free time than usual
not your choice
you didn't want the free time and you
wish you had your social life and maybe
your job back
and i said find something to improve
you know learn a skill get fit lose some
weight
and a number of people just did just
that now
as brian machiavelli noted
my book had a failed almost everything
and still win bank teaches you how to do
that
so it teaches you how to build a system
your own system
you know not my system if i were telling
you how to do it
probably wouldn't work because we're all
a little different but if i teach you
how to build a system that works for you
which was the point of it point of the
book
uh apparently it works
and honestly it might be the world's
best diet
program at this point i mean look at the
results is there
is there anybody who gets this kind of
results with normal diet programs
now the point of it is it's not a normal
diet
program it just teaches you how to
systemize
what people treat as a goal and just
turn it into a system and it's just
something you do every day
wow all right so for all of you who did
something uh
amazing during the pandemic you showed a
lot of character there
because it would be really easy
to just eat chocolate and sit out the
pandemic
but those of you who did far more than
that
i i salute you all right
dr nicole sapphire you know her md
probably seen around fox news et cetera
another good person to follow
so i recommend her as a twitter follow
and she's tweeting today that the fda
has updated some information on
adolescents and the vaccinations
and apparently there's just enough of a
problem of side effects
that they're recommending a halt for
adolescents all right so adults
still recommending it but for
adolescents they're saying well the risk
reward is different
because the adolescents have a very low
risk
but there's some side effects to worry
about so until they know more about that
at least according to this tweet it
looks like they're going to look into
that
linda says greg guffeld is killing it in
the ratings
yes he is yeah you know as soon as i
heard he would he would have a
show at that time period you knew it was
going to be
huge and sure enough
sure enough so congratulations to greg
big one of the big stories is uh hunter
biden is selling his artwork
for uh for anywhere from 75 000
to half a million per painting
per painting now you might say to
yourself
hmm is hunter biden a famous artist
no no is a hunter biden
a really good artist well that's
subjective isn't it
i don't believe he'd be giving half a
million dollars
uh thank you sparky i don't believe that
uh hunter biden would get half a million
dollars for a painting if his name were
not
biden does anybody think he would now
the real
the real risk here to the the country
if not the world is that it's a bribery
scheme
yeah it's a money laundering scheme and
if it's not obvious to you how it's a
money laundering scheme
it goes like this hey look i made some
scratchings on a piece of paper
it's for sale oh look somebody just
offered me a half a million dollars for
it
somebody connected to china they just
like
art i guess so china
send somebody to buy a half million
dollar painting
and then what does biden hunter biden
say to himself
hmm i think i'll make some more
paintings
and more chinese people maybe with
government
support we'll be buying these paintings
but i don't want to you know
say bad things about china don't want to
not sell them paintings
and maybe it won't be china specifically
that buys the paintings
could be somebody else who kind of wants
hunter biden to have a good impression
of him for whatever
political connections that might cause
and here's the the amazing thing about
this is
that pretty much everybody who's
you know at least alert to scams and
money laundering
schemes almost everybody saw this
immediately
right was was there anybody who's
sort of got a worldly uh viewpoint
who didn't see this like oh well that's
like
the most obvious money laundering scheme
of all time you could not come up with a
better
or more obvious or really more routine
you know just an ordinary money
laundering scheme
how does he get away with that because
have you ever heard the standard that
you want to
you want to avoid even the appearance of
conflict
he's not doing that he is creating the
appearance of conflict in the most
obvious right in your face
kind of way hey you want to see some uh
some conflict you know of interest yeah
let me show you one
it's gigantic now
to be clear i can't say that i know
hunter biden has bad intentions or that
you know
he's he's up to no good maybe he's just
an artist who's
who's finding that people will pay more
for his art than maybe he thought
or maybe he's a better artist than i
thought
maybe maybe
but i think this is one of those
situations where you have to avoid the
appearance
of money laundering if you're the
president's son
right does it matter if he's doing it
for that purpose
i don't think so i don't think that
matters
does it matter if there's some kind of
you know proof or even strong suggestion
that he's he's doing this for you know
some nefarious reason
it doesn't matter it really doesn't
matter
if you do something that is so glaringly
obviously
a conflict of interest or
maybe i'll soften that say glaringly
obviously
a risk of conflict of interest let's
let's remove the certainty
and just say it's clearly a risk
that's all you need to know so at what
point
what point does somebody just stop
caring if it's obvious
that this this guy seems to have no
shame whatsoever
yeah it's obvious i'll do it anyway and
i'm wondering what the conversation
looked like
between the president and hunter i
assume they had one
when when biden found out this was going
on
you know biden's only operating on half
a brain and even he would shut that
down
don't you think don't you think joe
biden is sort of
suggesting that maybe you back away from
this a little bit
you know sell a couple of paintings but
maybe back away from this
jeremiah says he'd say i'm proud of you
boy
maybe you would and of course the big
guy gets 10
but i doubt we're going to see any
evidence of that happening
uh here's an interesting story
apparently the feds are investigating
why so many presumed of course we don't
know for sure but
presumed chinese spy
left china and came to the united states
sooner than their normal schedule
would have suggested some of them you
know were
students or whatever so they they have a
let's call it a cover story and maybe
they actually are students
but they are assumed some of them were
many of them to be
chinese agents and somehow before the
the border closed before trump closed
travel from china
they got out and they got out
suspiciously early
and suspiciously in larger numbers than
you know history would suggest what did
they know
that you don't know or didn't know at
the time
now the suggestion is at least in
one report i was reading the suggestion
is that maybe they knew how bad things
were
and therefore china the government was
hiding it
but their spies certainly knew it so the
spies were acting as if they knew things
were going to get really bad really fast
and so they quickly moved to you know
travel to america because that's that's
where they can be effective
maybe can't rule out that
hypothesis but i'll give you another one
don't you think that china knows
what the administration is discussing
and when because they feel like they do
you know there's a leak there's you know
ways to find stuff out
i feel as if china would have known well
before
uh trump made the decision they would
have known it was
being talked about and if it was being
talked about
at the highest levels that's all you
need
they're talking about it let's just go
now and reduce any risk that anything
will
will change so go as soon as you can
just a normal risk reward
kind of a calculation and
so that's a possibility the other
possibility
is have i ever told you that i have this
weird
i don't know certainly the evidence that
we live in a simulation
is how often the headline news involves
me personally
i've talked about this a number of times
but you've seen this right
how many times has the news
somehow been about me like literally me
quite a few times and here's what i
don't know the exact timing of when
these
alleged spies came to the united states
in january of 2020
but at the end of january trump
closed travel sometime before that
a week more than a week or so i think if
i recall
i was publicly calling for the border to
be closed
now do you think china monitors its top
i don't know let's say top 20 critics in
the united states
the people who have some kind of public
platform and are talking about
china in a critical way and wouldn't you
say
i don't know how to measure this kind of
thing so i'll ask i'll put this in the
form of a question not a statement
would it be fair to say i'm in the top
20.
if you were china and you're trying to
keep an eye on the critics
because they might influence public
policy toward china
no you think they're watching me because
it would be crazy for them not to
i don't think anybody's got a more
hard-line
but reasonable stance against china than
i do
i mean they got to be looking at tom
cotton right i mean he's the senator but
you know obviously um they've got to be
looking at
you know everybody in congress who's
saying bad things about china
but also they would be looking at gordon
chang right and a number of other people
who
say bad things about china but there's
no way i'm not in the top
20 and certainly they're going to follow
the top 20.
so maybe your wife's a chinese spy
well that would explain a lot wouldn't
it would explain why she married me in
the first place
yeah maybe she is a chinese spy good
call
i better check into that so my point is
depending on when those chinese spies
came out i
i might have been the cause or at least
you know some part of the cause
which is weird you know i like to watch
the news more than i like to be the news
but maybe in this case and i don't know
what the odds are
it's more likely that they were hearing
chatter
before they heard me say it but i might
be part of the story i don't know
maybe
all right cnn uh
embarrassed themselves again by gushing
over the
biden handshake with putin how many of
you saw
uh putin and biden having the little
handshake before they won the building
and um jim
schuster kudos kudo skuito
you can pronounce his name at home any
way you'd like
and by the way i never i don't
mispronounce people's names
on purpose i'm not trying to be
disrespectful in that particular way
i'm just really bad at pronouncing names
so jim
skuto i guess uh
this is what he said quote the handshake
biden looked in the eye of putin with a
smile and putin looked away
these moments are about public posturing
about how you project
strength putin looked away
did that happen well it's on cnn right
and nobody corrected him and it and it
is true
that when they shook hands uh they shook
hands
and then you saw putin look this way
and you saw biden keeping his stare on
him
that we thought did you see putin
blink did joe's steely gaze
make him back down and have to look away
to get away from the
the the hot fire of biden's presence
was biden's alpha personality
so strong that putin the the head of a
nuclear power
couldn't handle it because putin
is so so weak apparently according to
cnn
that he can't even look our president in
the eye or is it because
biden is so dragon like with his fury
and his you know his resolution that
nobody could stand that gaze for much
longer they'd have to
look away i suppose that's one
interpretation
let me tell you my interpretation and i
want to see if it matches yours
so the two men shake biden keeps looking
at putin
putin looks toward the cameras
the cameras as he was shaking hands
putin did this he smiled
at all the cameras
biden forgot the cameras were there
or didn't care or didn't pick up on the
queue
or his dementia was setting in or he
just didn't know what to do
and he didn't look at the camera
that was a camera photo op now it's
possible
let me let me back up and make this not
abiding criticism
because you don't know what he was
thinking he might have been operating at
a higher level than i'm giving credit
for
possible and that is that he didn't want
to look at the camera
to make the photo op like a little bit
friendlier than he wanted to be
putin wants to make it look like they're
they're friends and everything's good so
he's looking at the camera biden might
not want to give him that photo
which would be smart right just he
basically
took the took the friendly photo where
they're both
looking at the camera and he just didn't
give him that
maybe smart so i'm not going to say he
was necessarily out of it and didn't
understand the situation
but putin was just looking at the camera
and it was exactly the right thing he
should have done
and cnn is reporting it like he blinked
you know biden stared him down nothing
like that happened
um i asked a question on
twitter that so far has not gotten me
banned because when people like me
ask or talk about medical anything
uh we're on shaky ground
but i asked this question and it's just
the question right so there's no
there's no uh belief here yet just the
question
i noted that after i got my second
vaccination
moderna vaccination that i seemed
healthier than normal and indeed it
seems like my allergies went away now
that happened before i
came here
carpe good to see you he says remember
when presidents didn't need flash cards
i was thinking if carpe dumped him uh a
lot recently because nobody made a good
meme
out of the end of macron going like this
with body
this is why we need carpe back in the
game
um what was i talking about oh uh
i fell healthier and my allergies seemed
to go away before i
left my normal environment i noticed it
and so i asked people
on twitter hey if you had this
experience has anybody had
some beneficial thing happen after the
second shot and i got a mixed
reaction so a number of people said no i
felt worse or
i don't know you know various little
medical problems seem to have come
after but surprisingly
quite a number of people said that their
allergies
seem to have gone away or substantially
reduced
after the second shot i know i know i
know
it also is coincidentally right after
the
allergy season ends right that's the
obvious thing
um somebody says the placebo effect i
don't know
if the placebo effect works on allergies
there's a good question for you i i i
respect
the observation because we know the
placebo effect is fairly universal
and seems to be in just about everything
we we study
so it's real you can can't ignore it
but the placebo effect would number one
assume that you thought that was going
to happen
so the placebo effect sort of depends on
the person
expecting an outcome i didn't expect
this
i didn't expect any anything except a
vaccination
so probably the the the essential part
of what made the placebo work which is
the mental part
i didn't have that mental part so to me
it would have been just
a surprise right which is the opposite
of a placebo
so i don't think it was placebo a number
of other people reported it's just
anecdotal i wouldn't take
any take any of this too uh too
seriously
but here's a interesting fact
and i tweeted this you'll see it in my
timeline from just a few hours ago
but apparently there's something called
non-specific
effects from vaccinations have you ever
heard of that
non-specific effects apparently there is
um it's a well not well known but it's a
known
phenomenon that you can get a
vaccination for
a specific problem and that vaccination
can grow
can cause a number of other problems so
non-specific
problems basically things you didn't
think were going to be a problem side
effects
but also can fix other problems
and there's a little story about some
you know
older kinds of vaccinations that were
used on some
you know non-industrial tribe somewhere
and it reduced their overall mortality
for reasons that had nothing to do with
the vaccinations
so we do know that that's a real thing
that sometimes a vaccination at the same
vaccination
can cause some people some extra
problems
and some people might actually live
longer
that could could actually change your
your life expectancy
now i'm not saying that that's true
necessarily of these vaccinations
because we've got some new technology
going on etc
but be aware it's an actual thing
so maybe i'll let you know if my
allergies come back
but so far so good
all right uh georgia secretary of state
brad rafsenberger
or rav raffin's sperger not burger
he tweeted that new revelations that
fulton county
is unable to produce all ballot dropbox
transfer documents
will be investigated thoroughly as we
have
when other countries blah blah so
georgia is looking into the lack
of transfer documents the transfer
documents would show
you know who had it where it went to etc
and those are missing
which suggests at least the possibility
that some of them could have disappeared
we wouldn't know would we so what would
happen
let me give you this hypothetical what
would happen
if we can if we determine that the chain
of custody can never be determined
because i think i think those
votes don't count but it's too late
to really change the outcome i mean
there's no real i don't think there's
any practical way
that any elections could be over
overturned for any reason
it's just too late and and i actually
agree with that
i think it would be terribly
destabilizing to
change things in the middle of a
president's term
so if anything it might influence
you know the next election so maybe
increase the chances of
trump getting back in office but
what do you think as a citizen you know
for those of you
who are american citizens watching this
what do you think about the fact
that at the moment we don't know if we
had a real election
the fact that the transfer documents are
missing
tells you you don't know if you had a
real election
i mean literally you don't know now
can i be banned from that because i'm
making a very specific claim
which is you know in the news and not in
dispute
that these documents are missing
that's all and if the documents are
missing
we don't know if we had a proper
election
that's just a fair statement right i
think i won't get
kicked off of that
somebody was mocking me on twitter which
is you know
half of what twitter is saying that
my prediction that trump would win and
that
the slaughter meter was predicting his
win with great certainty
uh shows i had a wrong prediction now i
agree with that
that characterization it's definitely a
wrong prediction
but why is it wrong is it wrong because
i'm not good at reading the mood of
voters
perhaps perhaps
but i think it was wrong because the
election was determined by lawyers
meaning that prior to the vote by
anybody
the lawyers had decided what the rules
would be
and the rule change probably determined
the election
i'm guessing so i was definitely wrong
but i think it's important to look at
why and i don't think we know why
especially if these transfer forms are
missing
so there could be more than one reason
that i was wrong one of them at least
is that lawyers lawyered up the rules
to favor one side over the other and
sure enough that
the favored side won so i don't know if
voters even mattered
voters really all we did is get the
result close enough
that the lawyers had the the final vote
that's all we did
yeah basically voters gave the imprint
of something like democratic ish
happening but we didn't determine the
winner
that was determined by the rules if
there had been different rules
probably different outcomes i don't know
if we're going to change the result
but it certainly would have been a big
difference
speaking of biden did you see the video
where he confused libya
and syria you know allegedly three times
i
you know one of those times i'm not sure
he really confused them
but he does he definitely confused them
and i have a little bit of sympathy for
that
because because
i confuse things all the time i didn't
always have so
how many times have i said the wrong
country
kind of all the time right i mean you've
seen me do it
and i still feel that i'm mentally
competent and i don't know that that's
a big deal on its own right just
confusing the country or even honestly
forgetting what
a city you're in when you're campaigning
there's a kind of normal things
kind of normal now angela says but adams
is not president
but humans are present right humans
and humans do that all the time i'm not
sure that i would
say that that by itself is a bad thing
but do you think that the g7 leaders are
laughing at him for not knowing the
difference between libya and syria
oh i think they might have had a chuckle
over that
oh i think they did is there a national
security threat
when our president can't remember which
country
is the important one i think there is
right wouldn't you imagine
um yeah it introduced the same person
twice
yeah so biden has all these little uh
gaffs and
they do look like you know genuinely
their memory problems or whatever
i don't know how important it is because
these are the types of mistakes that his
handlers would fix
you know it's not like he's going to go
to a meeting
and make a decision about libya when he
thought he was talking about syria
people would stop him from doing that
jill would stop him right so
he's a weird president because
exactly it's some combination of
his handlers plus what he's willing to
do
because obviously he's not going to be
willing to do everything his handlers
want him to do
he's still got free will and a lot of
experience
but we don't really have like a
presidency
with a strong leader we have some sort
of a committee mostly people we don't
know
whose work we only see as it's presented
through
through biden and honestly i i don't
know if it matters
i really don't you could assume
that our adversaries would at least try
to get a little more adventurous just to
see what happens
um but i'm not seeing it play out yet
is it is it a danger to the republic and
maybe the whole world
yeah yeah it is yeah it's
he's a little too uh
joe bidenish at this point uh with his
age and
declining mental state that i think he's
a genuine risk to the republic
but i don't know how big it is because
his handlers are probably
probably doing a good job for democrats
um having the world leaders love you is
not a good thing yeah that's true
you don't want him to like you too much
yeah vanity fair is photographing first
ladies again
can you believe they skipped melania
now i'm not a historian but let's say
jackie kennedy was you know considered a
cover-worthy model but there aren't many
of them
and there's certainly nobody in
melania's class
you know somebody who's professional
model and and looks it
so the fact that they skipped her is
just a big f you
bush is your favorite first lady
somebody says yeah
yeah elena says yeah let's skip the the
super model
when we're when we're designing our
covers don't use the supermodel
wait for jill jill biden
uh ma says that uh kovid was like
acupuncture for your allergies
well i don't know if i buy into that
analogy but
um tikka on the jazz says is closer now
to the ccp she is the leader but he's
really just the most powerful guy in the
committee oh yes
so china is is ruling by committee
but i have to think that you wouldn't
want to go against she
at this point on paper it's the party
that's in
power right and they just have somebody
doing the doing the work of the leader
but i have a feeling that she has
consolidated power to the point
that if he had a strong critic
on in the ccp probably just get killed
or eliminated somehow i i don't imagine
that he has real criticism
i do imagine he has full control can't
know for sure
obama and susan rice are running things
that's what somebody says here
what's new in santorini well let me tell
you uh so christine and i took a uh
an e-bike tour of
santorini today so i'm in greece
and if you haven't if you haven't tried
an e-bike i know
it's boring i keep saying it all
when i talk about e-bikes but they are
the future
the moment you get on one the first time
you ever try an e-bike
you will be hooked and it doesn't matter
if you like
motorcycles better or you like your
regular bike
they are just crazy good it's like
insanely good
technology uh so anyway
we go to the middle of nowhere this will
shack basically
where they've got an e-bike and
four-wheel drive things that you rented
we got our e-bikes
and i didn't know exactly what to expect
it was an island tour
what i expected was kind of a
leisurely stroll around the island maybe
the perimeter
and stuff what i knew we wouldn't do
because that would be crazy
would be to go up these steep hills uh
or to go through any of these like
narrow narrow
streets because some of the streets are
so narrow
that the bicycle handles you know would
would be pretty close to the walls on
both sides
that's sort of a dangerous thing because
the ground is all uneven everywhere
so no in any part of the city the ground
is uneven everywhere
right so you don't want to go through a
narrow
steep hill with an uneven floor
on a vehicle that you just got on right
it's like everything is wrong with that
that model is too dangerous so i knew we
weren't going to go through
any narrow streets and obviously we're
not going to go
like to the top of the mountain because
you know they didn't know if we had the
ability to do that even with an e-bike
so uh we went to the top of a mountain
and we went through the narrow narrow
the narrow streets
by the way the reason the streets are so
narrow here is that they were designed
that way
originally to repel uh pirates and
invaders because you would make the
invaders go through a narrow passage and
you could kill them one at a time
and you know once their bodies built up
they became a barrier to their own
you know rest of the attack so so the
streets are
insanely narrow or at least the
passageways between things are insanely
narrow
um i think i took four spills
i fell off the damn bike i think four
times
uh christine about the same about the
same
it was the most rugged dangerous thing
i've done
in a long time but it was great
so let me say this first off i highly
recommend it
if you if you ever get a chance to do an
e-bike tour even in santorini
and even though it's you know even
though it's uh
let's say by american nanny standards
almost none of this would have been even
legal in the united states
i mean literally the the the safety
standards here
are uh quaint
all the little narrow passageways and
you know low
low uh low barriers over a cliff
i mean you just would never do any of
this stuff in the united states
but we're trying to go up these narrow
hills and stuff and it was just
amazing so but here's the funny part
the best feature of the trip is that we
we ended up on all these narrow trails
that it looks like
only animals uh that only animals
used and we're going over rocks and
things i've
by the way i've never i've never done
trail riding
so i've never been on a bicycle on a
anything that wasn't a paved
thing for any length of time so this was
my first experience
uh riding up a unpaved in many places a
lot of it was paved but in places it was
just a trail
with you know big rocks everywhere and
you're you're hitting rocks and stuff
then then a number of parts were
soft sand so your front tire would go
into it it would just go
and you'd be you'd be laying by the side
of the road
and the guides did it perfectly so if
you're
i guess if you're experienced enough and
you know that if you know the route
you're
you're fine but if you're not that
experienced
with this route and you've never ridden
on a trail
it was pretty freaking dangerous but
here's the best part
do you know what was at the top of the
mountain
a winery so we went to the top of the
mountain to the winery
just beautiful views absolutely
recommend it was the greatest thing
uh but it was for wine tasting
and no i i don't drink so i didn't i
just
put my tongue in a glass and tasted so i
didn't really drink
but can you imagine
their their business model is to go to
do this insanely dangerous ride
and then have some drinks and ride back
down the hill
and there was one part that was so
dangerous
that i don't think a goat would have
done it like you know you've got a cliff
and you've got this narrow path and
you're on a bicycle on like dirt and
rocks
so there's one part of it they you know
they said you better walk your bike so
you
so you don't fall off the cliff and we
did
so you know i make it sound like it's
more dangerous than it probably was
but the odds of you falling off your
bike
multiple times on this trip really high
really high as i see in the comments
you're asking about dr drew
um i'm actually going we're actually
going to be having dinner
with dr drew in about half an hour and i
got to get ready for that
so um i hope you brought his uh
he brought us his medical bag
might need some extra bandages all right
uh how's the food
um the food is
spectacular in in many individual cases
but a lot of it is stuff that i don't
eat um and then there are a lot of
things that there are a cultural
difference
that um takes a little explaining
for example i ordered a bagel with cream
cheese
toasted basic thing right a toasted
bagel
with cream cheese and the first time i
ordered it it came and it was cold
and i thought this probably they just
forgot to toast it or something then the
second time i ordered it
it came sort of refrigerator cold with
cream cheese
now in the comments is there anybody who
would eat
a cold bagel that never been toasted
with cream cheese has anybody ever eaten
that
in the history of people eating bagels
and i i think it was a different
sort of a cultural difference
uh and i think that maybe some other
countries do it or some other people or
they're just not
used to americans ordering bagels
because it wasn't on the menu
you know it's such a nice hotel that you
can just sort of order stuff that's not
on the menu
and it just shows up
um oh some of you have
some of you have nick says you've
actually eaten the
cold bagel but with cream cheese i've
eaten
i've eaten a delicious bagel without
cream cheese
but why would you put it yes and i'm
talking not room temperature i'm talking
it was it was cool to the touch
like it came out of a refrigerator
recently
so here's my point i would say that the
food and the service here are
spectacular
just just really first rate
but if you don't know what to order you
can get something
you didn't expect and i don't eat a lot
of exotic things
all right uh i'm just looking at your
comments for a moment
some of some of you have eaten bagels
not toasted with cream cheese
interesting all right um
so somebody says uh trump is gonna visit
the border
before uh kabul harris that would be
funny
i sure hope that happens all right i
need to go do something else
i hope you enjoyed the best coffee with
scott adams
of all time until tomorrow it's going to
be even better
you just wait and i will talk to you
tomorrow
