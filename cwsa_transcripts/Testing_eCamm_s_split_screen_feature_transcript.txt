hmm
well with any luck
I just went live
on YouTube and I'm using uh ecam
software which means I'll have the
capability to allow a guest in
and you'll be able to see them in the
split screen so I'm testing the
technology
I guess I should turn this off
um
so let's see if I can bring somebody in
um I don't know if I should be seeing
you
the the people who are asking to come in
don't show up as images so this is a
technical test
so this is exactly the kind of thing I'm
trying to figure out
if I allow this person in will it give
me a split screen
or all right that put the guest in The
Green Room
and here I could add them to the right
hey
now the question is
can I hear you
do you have a do you have a good
microphone
well Clara
I gotta go change of Audrey come on I
don't know if you can hear that but we
can hear you yeah yeah I can definitely
hear that
sorry about that
it's a good technology test
yeah I don't I don't think the uh the
viewers are going to want to listen to
Too Much indoors in the back
uh yeah touche I always like it
because it seems more natural
yeah but I know there are people who
clawing their eyes out right now
um
thanks for uh thanks for coming in did
you have a quick question
uh yeah a question I've wanted to ask
for a while actually is why do you think
the persuasion filter is so good at
predicting
because it's the prime variable
uh usually you can't tell what variable
is going to be the big one and usually
it's a mix of you know just bunch of
variables but if you have something like
somebody like Trump
uh who is good at it then it becomes the
biggest variable so it can overwhelm the
other variables and make everything else
seem trivial there are not too many
things that could do that
fear fear can do that
so I mean I guess that's part of the
persuasion filter is assuming the fear
would be persuasive so
um I guess it's
it's predictive once you understand that
people are not rational
if you're clinging to the idea that
people make rational decisions nothing
makes sense
the whole world just a confusing ball of
you know strength
but once you release on that and say
okay we'll use the persuasion filter and
just assume people can be persuaded
to believe any damn thing some of the
things I saw on the on the internet
today
were unbelievable well I'll give you
I'll give you a quick example uh without
details I I saw somebody claim that a
thing didn't exist
and they asked somebody to prove it
so the person within minutes I think
produced a YouTube link that was exactly
what they said existed
and then the people who said that
doesn't exist what do you think they
said did they say oh wow
I revised my entire world view because
it was right there I collect that you
know the link worked and it and it was
very clear very quick very easy no
ambiguity whatsoever one one side was
completely right
and the other side had nothing and the
people who had nothing
they said
there's no proof
and the people who had just given it to
him said oh here it is again
and the people who said it didn't exist
said well if you can't prove it if you
don't have any evidence and I'm looking
at the at the threat of the the evidence
was just littered all over the thread
you know people talking about it it's
the most retweeted part you know and and
I thought how is it even possible and
the only the only way any of this is
possible is once you accept that people
are fundamentally irrational and that
there's no amount of evidence that can
convince somebody that they're wrong
about something that they believe to be
very right
now there's a very do you do you hear
the annoying little uh indicator going
off
yeah just barely
so that's an option that I should be
able to turn off somewhere
so the the oh man that's gonna be really
annoying
that can't be any worse than my daughter
was
all right so so I'm going to move on and
try another guest
thank you great Take Care thank you all
right thanks for doing the first
all right
what happens if we bring in
what is that right here eat your bites
what is everybody in the dark
oh there you are all right
so can you see me and hear me
hello I can and who are you yes I can
hear you
what's your name
Ariana Eliana Eliana
well it's very nice to see you
you have no idea who I am do you

beard

offices I trimmed down a little bit

back the beer
 and then I shaved my head so that
people don't know that I'm saying
do you believe I'm Santa Claus

well it's not true yeah is that so close
yeah okay
okay we're gonna take another call
thank you for thank you for joining
and have a great night I can't talk
thank you
thank you
say bye bye how about James James
yeah okay okay
we're going to take another call thank
you thank you for thank you for joining
and have a great night
Scott hello
I'm great so how are you
perfect it almost sounds like you have a
microphone is that just your your phone
no I'm lounging a little bit all right
but it uh you have a perfect sound
I'm coming to you from a MacBook Pro
and and where are you now what part of
the world Baltimore Maryland oh I'm
sorry
it's not that bad hey Scott I'm a uh
I've been a disciple of yours for the
last two years I've followed your life
strategy degree outline yeah how's it
working
pretty good I got a job as a corporate
lawyer
really
did you go to law school or did you just
like walk right in and nail the job
interview uh no you you have to uh no
you have to go to law school first I was
already a lawyer before okay and then I
followed some of your ideas and
it got me uh got me my dream job now I
represent startups and private Equity
Funds and
I make a lot more money
God how wonderful do you think so thank
you very much do you take equity in some
of the startups
no that's against the rules of
professional responsibility as I wish
yeah that's actually probably that's
that's probably a good rule yeah that's
probably a good deal
this is pretty incredible
so uh did this make the world seem a
little bit small to you just just at the
moment
absolutely but I also read in one of
your books that
um you had a a reader who had done
affirmations uh to try and contact you
and you were working on a startup idea
and he was able to contact you through
that so I don't know maybe this is sort
of the same thing or maybe it was just
easy to contact
that's also possible
well thanks for uh thanks for joining
and do you do you have a uh question
anything you'd like to ask before I go
um
well I've seen as I I didn't think that
I'd I'd actually get to talk to you
um I just I really just wanted to say
thanks and and uh you know I'm excited
to read your next book about reframing
keep up the good work do a great job it
was was it the how to fail at almost
everything book that made the difference
is that the one that helped you
uh that definitely helped a lot but
really you know you have you have good
advice across all of your your um even
just your live streams
um sometimes you throw in some good
nuggets in there all right that's good
it's good to hear so thanks and uh if I
can go to the next guest figure that out
I will absolutely take care Scott
all right
um
let's see
let's see if you are if you're being
billed as what you are
I'm not going to use your uh screen name
since it's self-insulting
but
um can you hear and see me
can you talk
can you talk
yes okay
and do you have a question for me
are you I I do not actually I've tried
connecting three times at this
just was making sure it worked oh thank
you this is part of the the technical
test is working the only thing I can't
figure out is how to turn off this
notification
how in the world do I do that
hmm
all right well I guess I have to figure
that out
um have you watched my uh live streams
I'll bet you have are you a member of
local
yeah oh okay yeah that's the only we
only way you would have known where to
get the link
so those of you who are wondering how
are people joining this the only people
can join other people have the secret
link
and they're they're subscribers in the
locals platform
but I'm gonna let somebody else in and
uh thanks for being part of the test
Roger
uh
next is
hello hello
can you hear me
Scott yeah where did my picture go
let's see if I can make myself come back
hey except them in the wrong place
I'm going to add you to the right
all right
then
this technical test is going a little a
little sketchy we'll get rid of this one
there we go
interesting
um and where are you
can you hear me
Scott can you hear me yeah I can hear
you can you hear me oh hey I'm in
Winnetka Illinois
wow that's a place I've never been
uh just north of Chicago by Northwestern
University is the corn High
corn is uh is about ready to harvest
it's starting to dent and about ready to
uh ready to be picked
that's the coolest place about that the
coolest thing about that time of year
out there is there's some highways where
you can drive forever and it's nothing
but corn on the left and the right it's
crazy I drove down to Indiana I drove to
Indianapolis last week and uh that's all
it is is corn and soybeans the whole way
right if you can't see beyond it right
because it's like 12 feet tall though
that's it just point point the car in
One Direction and go yeah
all right do you have any questions for
me
yeah I actually did uh like so uh when
was the one moment that you realized
that you kindly kind of kind have had
made it and things were going to be
different for you
and was that scary
uh well
this uh this gets to what I call the the
pop the champagne moment so you're
asking me like what was that that moment
yeah I've joked for decades now that
it's really really frustrating that that
no that moment never happens
because what happens is when when you
tell the story about how it happened you
you truncate it into a like a nice
little summary
but in the real world it's things happen
but they're not quite solid yet
and then you're like ah I can't
celebrate yet I'll give you an example
so when I first got an offer to be a
syndicated cartoonist meaning that they
would help me sell into newspapers
um I was like Yay I made it but it
wasn't like a deal to be a newspapers it
was a deal to work with them to see if
it could become a deal
so like ah well it's great but I don't
know if it'll work
so then I worked with them for several
months and they decided to Launch
so that's that's the next champagne
moment so I'm like yes I'm gonna launch
and then they say it doesn't mean
anybody's going to buy it
I'm like oh yeah okay I can't really
celebrate because I've sold zero
so then they sell it and like okay this
is going to be big and they they say
well we sold it into like 35 newspapers
I'm like yes that's a pretty good start
isn't it they're like no no not really
100 would have been pretty good
35 is not good and then I'm like well at
least it's in 35 newspapers yes and then
they say well
probably not we sold it into 35 markets
but it's fairly common that they'll buy
it and put it on the shelf and not run
it in the newspaper because for a very
low price they could keep it away from
the competition
so sometimes if they think it might be a
hit
they'll buy it preemptively to keep it
away from the second newspaper back when
there were two newspapers in town
so I'm like so you mean it might not
actually be in any newspaper anywhere
and they said well hard to know
so I couldn't celebrate and then it gets
published and like yes I'm a published
cartoonist Maybe
because I didn't know it was actually
published anywhere and then you know
later they say here it is in the
newspaper you know I got to actually see
it in the newspaper well yes yes but
that doesn't mean you get to be a
cartoonist it just means one thing got
published one place it hasn't been
canceled yet so then did you quit your
date had you quit your day job yet no
not for over six years
so it took a long time the first three
years it was just a failure essentially
and then I started running my email
address in the strip and people
you know said we'd like it when he's in
the office we don't like it when he's
doing generic things so I put him in the
office
and then there were a number of other
things like the birth of the internet
and the media wanted a face to put on
the phenomena
and the internet didn't have a person
you know that that really fit and then
Dilbert came along and they're like oh
yeah Dilbert's the prototypical techie
sort of worker so it became you know on
magazine covers and you know it just it
just blew up after that so but it was a
whole bunch of mini victories
but I'll tell you the the closest one
that just was the one they'll always
remember
when I wrote my first book there was
more than just a collection of comics it
was called the Dilbert principle
and for some reason I had this
I had this crazy
confidence that it would be a number one
best-selling book I'd never written a
book I'd never even taken a class in
writing except for you know business
writing which is different
and so I write this book and it climbs
up the charts it's immediately uh you
know New York Times bestseller but it
stalls at number two
and I was really happy
because it was my first book it was a
number two best-selling book on the
non-fiction list and
but I thought to myself
I'll bet one's better
if I could get to one and the next week
would come in the publisher they get a
little preview and they call and they
say um when the list comes out tomorrow
you're you're still number two and I
thought you know
I I'm not going to make a big deal about
not being number one I mean being number
two
for a couple weeks in a row is like
amazing right so I how much better could
it be like you know it's just once one
slot
and the weeks go by it was it was Dennis
Rodman's autobiography what's the number
one and I I forget how many weeks it was
because my memory extends things but
there were several weeks that were just
hugely frustrating because by then we
already had a lot of indication that we
were outselling that book
so that the metrics that the public the
publisher has separately
clearly showed that my book was number
one
and so I'm waiting for the the New York
Times list to reflect that
and it didn't
and then the next week they say oh
you're definitely number one I mean
you're you're selling the crap out of it
you're definitely beating that other
book
and then the list comes out
number two
and one day however many weeks into what
it was I get a call and my publisher
says when the list comes out tomorrow
you're the number one book in the world
I mean New York Times less but
effectively the the world I was caring
about the English-speaking world at that
time and I have to tell you
that I was completely wrong about the
difference between the number two
bestseller and number one
as number two I was getting a lot of
attention
but when it hit number one
this guy exploded
and wow and everything was different and
it was it was different in such a
profound way I mean it was a several
orders of magnitude difference I mean it
was just gigantic did your publisher
come to you did your publisher come and
ask you when are you writing your next
one now after you're at number one
trying to put pressure on you well I'm
not sure if they want me to admit this
but the truth is that the first book
that was number one
um had been trimmed down from a larger
book so I had submitted much more than
got published because you know it was
not too big so we actually just took the
stuff that wasn't as good
as what was the was in the first book
because we'd all decided not to publish
it and we published it and it became a
number two best-selling book
at the same time that the other one was
number one so you even though months
have gone by they they rushed it out and
they hit at the same time
so
when that happened
that led to a fairly big book contract
and unlike cartooning which you know is
ridiculously well paying if if you're at
the you know top tier
um it's not as big as a book contract
like a multi-book contract if if you've
got a lot of attention if you've had a
number one book
and so the Press reported some
ridiculous number that you know was sort
of an exaggerated number from the
reality but the reality was pretty good
and
I could
um I knew
I knew from that moment
oh
that's such a nice picture
anyway I knew from that moment
that
um
I would never be poor unless I did
something really stupid and
I'd always had a number in my head that
you know if I made x amount of money if
ever I made that much money that I would
you know quit and never work again
and the moment I actually had that I
literally had that much money in my hand
in the chat yeah it was one check that
was exactly the roughly the amount of
money that I said if I ever had that
much money I'll never work again
and as soon as it's in your hand
do you know what happens
you say you know it's not really that
much money because I'm still kind of
young blah blah you know like well what
if I wanted to start a business you know
this you know you really need a lot of
money to do so and so you immediately
talk yourself into it was no big deal
and objectively speaking it was a big
deal
but it's absolutely yeah it's such a
mind effort
that as soon as you do it it becomes
meaningless
that makes me I need to ask you another
question then since you just said that
about having that number in your head
right
the other day the other day in the in
the cave the other night you mentioned
well maybe I want to be a billionaire
right all right you mentioned something
like so this is the hardest thing that I
have systems versus goals totally
believe in the system but I still find
myself hanging goals out there in front
of me right yeah
yeah do you do you hang is that a goal
that you've hung out in front of you are
you still hanging goals out there for
yourself so
humans can't avoid having goals because
it's just sort of an automatic thing I
would like to have that more than I like
having what I have now I mean
I mean it's automatic but so the reason
I minimize goals is if it's all you got
it's not enough
so there's nothing I can do to tell you
to turn off the fact that you have goals
I don't have to tell you anything about
that that's just an automatic reflex the
part I need to tell you about is make
sure you have a system that's preparing
you for not just that but maybe a
variety of things that you hadn't even
thought of which is what makes a good
system good system will give you
uh access to more than one goal
so that's why goals are limited
um but but here here's the weird thing
it has actually never been my goal to be
a billionaire I just realized
I want it the same way everybody wants
it
and I'm surprised that it hasn't
happened which is a weird
a weird I don't know defect or feature
in my personality I'm not even sure
myself
um
but I've never said to myself damn it my
my single-minded focus is to have a
billion dollars I've just always thought
I thought it would happen
you know you said you said it you said
it the other night and your whole like
mannerism seemed different when you said
it to me the way I yeah which I thought
was pretty cool
um
so yeah I guess when I think about it I
don't think about it in terms of you
know what it would do to my lifestyle
because everything you add just makes
things more complicated
you know so I'm not big on I have one
car in one house and that's like one car
in one house too much like that they're
just a pain in the ass
so yeah owning stuff I'm just not into
it it's just so much work
um you know but I like my drum set so I
like I like to have enough money to do
fun hobbies and stuff
so
um I don't know was there was I
answering a question there was I
rambling
no that was perfect and look at thanks
for everything you do I watch you all
the time I use a lot of the things you
tell me
um so appreciate it thank you all right
you better take another caller thank you
yeah we'll see you bye
let's see if
David is ready
David
come to the Green Room David
I don't think you have a camera on you
time I use a lot of the things you tell
me
um so it looks like there's a little
delay there isn't it
yeah we'll see you
all right so you did not know that you
were live so you missed your chances
yeah I said this is a valuable lesson to
you all
ah sorry about that can you hear me
all right hold on
um
trying to add it for me
Gail are you there the whole idea
so here's a little flow with the uh the
problem with the flow of the system so
there's a delay between
the YouTube feed and this
so when I think I'm adding people
they don't know they're being added for
maybe a full minute
and I I just see them watching the show
but they're watching the show as it was
a minute ago
so one scale realizes that the camera's
on and she's live
she might lose I'm here hello
hey
you're not on camera
well because of my hair
oh my hair is wet and I don't have
makeup on all right
well can you do it can you do a hand
puppet or something but put your hand
over hello all right that's better hello
all right do you have an animal or a pet
or something we can look at
um there's Ziggy the painting of a pet
I know there's Ziggy oh
where's Ziggy there's a dog's hair wet
too or
it's a cat oh a cat okay
Ziggy Ziggy say hi Oh my God it's a
tuxedo cat
yeah
I I'm getting PTSD because I owned a
tuxedo cat for 19 years
and not once did she let not once did
she let me work unmolested
she would jump on my drawing hand and my
typing hand and and was obsessed with it
like every day was just like
this battle with her like I had tonight
with my dog
that I spent 45 minutes trying to figure
out how I could sit somewhere without my
dog making me guilty that I'm not doing
something with her right now
but I think I worked it out
all right I'm gonna go somewhere where
there's a face that's not a cat although
that cat is very that's an awesome cat
all right thanks for joining
great talking to you Scott
all right I think I see what to do here
I think I see the trick
the trick is to uh let them join in a
little green room thing and then not to
bring them on until I see them
like now
let's see how this works
Daniel can you hear me
yes sir how are you doing hey I'm good
where are you what state
um Basin Florida sir I'm sorry Florida
in Florida yes in Orlando
your house is in here all right and uh
what would be the humidity if you're
walking outside right now would it melt
you uh probably between uh steamer
and uh I don't know it's hell something
like that yeah it's like a steamer in
hell yeah do you have any questions for
me
um yeah I have a few but the first thing
is I wanted to say thank you I've been
following you for I would say three
years now
um I was thinking how I discovered you
and as far as I remember was through one
of Team ferris's books the uh tools of
Titans can talk about you yes and uh
after that I mean I've been following
you every day I think it's one of my
routines in the morning just want to
take a break have some coffee and and do
the simultaneous ship so it's very good
good
all right if you have any questions for
me
yes so
um I've been following systems as soon
as I as I met what do you do for three
years now and and they're working very
well right and I think that
inadvertently I was doing something
similar to that before I I am Mexican I
moved to this country not long time ago
and uh I was I mean from a very
complicated situation to something much
better and I think that much better now
that I follow you oh parenthesis
politics and Mexico some things are very
similar than here we can talk about that
later but okay but now quick question is
I haven't been able to
Implement a system to get the systems
going without getting to at some point
in the week that I'm completely burned
out I probably work 16 18 hours a day I
have different jobs uh I I do Consulting
and it's it's it's those are good jobs
and I've been doing some stuff on the
side for uh startups and working on that
but at some point I get up I hit a wall
during the week like I cannot do anymore
I'm just completely tired and I don't
know what to do I don't know how to
solve it I was a really good advice
um and I was in that situation myself
and I went to my doctor and I said man
you know maybe you need to test my I
don't know my testosterone or my thyroid
or something because I'm just like
exhausted just exhausted
and the doctor says so uh how much do
you sleep
and that I told them yeah that he said
get more sleep
I said and and surgery right
not really but he's like uh no you have
to sleep
so
I just made time for sleep so there's no
magic to it you're you're just working
too hard the the the illusion is that
that extra 10 is going to get you an
extra 10 percent
it doesn't there's there's diminishing
returns
so you're probably going to do as well
or better if you
cut back 20 percent
right because if you're redlining it
you're probably not doing your best work
for all that you know the other stuff
probably there's probably a little
something that gets you know short short
uh attention so yeah yep yep that's what
I do I would just be brutal in
essentializing now the thing about that
is that it's hard to be brutal with the
schedule
because you know you just feel like you
have to get something done you promised
somebody something but you're gonna have
to you have to learn to be brutal about
your own time management and I'm going
to give you a trick that worked for me
when I was on those periods
you got to make sure that everybody else
knows how busy you are then they will
then they will say well I know you're
busy
but you know could you do this and you
end up with a totally different
atmosphere of expectations but if people
don't know that you're redlining they're
kind of going to expect sort of
immediate responses and then that that
can get dense
so use your busy schedule as a shield
um
to moderate other people's expectations
but not you know not at the expense of
losing a client of course you know
yeah so that's my that's my best advice
is just prioritize yourself a little bit
more and I don't think you'll lose
anything
that that's probably what you needed to
hear you probably needed somebody who
wasn't yourself
who's you know just been around a while
to say that I can't think of any time
that that extra hour of work made a
difference in my life ever
but I definitely the extra hour of sleep
if you said an extra hour that the 16th
hour of work you do per day
versus one extra hour of sleep
that's not even close but you needed me
to say it right that's why you need it
because you're too aggressive you're
you're yeah I can tell you just you're
you're just aggressive so you're you're
basically out there trying to grab what
you can and you need somebody to tell
you
just just take the extra hour for sleep
you'll be fine
thank you sir
I think that's what you needed
uh yeah thanks for the call
yeah thank you and uh I think I will say
in probably the name of everybody that
follows you that we feel like you're
part of the family you're part of our
routine you're part of the things that
we do and I can I I can hear myself
sometimes thinking
um what is the context of this or uh
it's still on the nose so it's it's and
and I was thinking these days I will
really really really love to to meet uh
Scott and probably an affirmation for a
few days yeah so this thing was just and
it's amazing and there's so many more
things that I would like to talk to you
I know you're busy so I try to find a
way to to reach out to you but again
thank you from the bottom of my heart
you're doing a fantastic job man you're
just doing it do you see how well my
trick worked you just said I know you're
busy
but I'm gonna get enough sleep tonight
so all right yes sir great talk of you
how are you doing bye-bye all right
bye-bye
all right uh let's see
we're gonna invite John on here and now
that I've learned to time this right we
won't add him until his signal comes up
which I think is going to come on maybe
I should just accept everybody and then
whoever's signal comes up first I'll
take
all right it looks like
Craig
can you hear me
were you ready for me Craig we're
looking at your top of your head
hey
all right say something
all right we don't have audio green
gotta drop it out Scott Adams In the
Flesh hey where he is what what state
are you in
uh your audio is cutting out on my on my
laptop real bad I'm sorry hey what time
it came on there's the delay what state
are you can you hear me all right yeah
you want to get rid of your YouTube feed
I think yeah the feed I probably was I
was watching on the YouTube feed but uh
that's that's pretty cool hey I was
gonna tell you I I helped produce for
another YouTube show I don't want to say
which one it is because I don't want to
do something on your stream but I want
to give you a hint
you might get a kick out of doing some
live uh like Google call in get yourself
a Google Voice number and then you can
forward that to your own number nobody
needs to know it is and you can actually
take Live phone calls on your show I
think that'd be really cool to do the
guy that I work with he does that and he
gets a lot of calls all the time they
are sometimes you gotta shut them up
because they may not say what you like
and I know that you do not like it when
people don't agree with you and you boot
them out of your chat which is awesome
but in a bigger picture would that be
better though than having a split screen
because I'd rather I mean a lot of
people don't want to come on camera
they're they're afraid to put their face
out there but they want to put their
opinion and even if they're a troll you
know the guy that I screen for we use
OBS open broadcast studio okay and he
sits in another room and ice cream is
called sometimes but typically I just
help him with building the content uh
he's a late night guy but at the bottom
line is having that Google Voice you
don't have to ever give a phone number
other than that Google Voice number and
nobody pays for long distance anymore
right and then when you want to open up
the phones you just take the calls and
if they troll you just say you and
hang up on them like you would normally
do that's what I like about you guys
that do this
job working in the background sorry yeah
I'd heard about that idea with the the
Google number and forward it
um I I might do that there might be
there might be a place for that I think
I'm going to prefer the visual
the visual benefit but you know half the
people are listening to it on podcasts
anyway so that'd be good well you get a
good following I mean you've got what
two three thousand in the live stream I
was uh turning you on to my folks that
live down in Arizona and I was showing
my stepdad how we can watch you know
bringing up YouTube on the Samsung Smart
TV and now every morning at seven when
I'm down there because I've been down
there a lot the last couple months I'm
like hey Scott's coming on let's watch
him and you know these guys uh as you
know Arizona is a big pro-trump state
and so they they got a lot of uh I'm up
here in the Pacific Northwest I live in
Seattle so I'm kind of middle of the
road when it comes to politics but uh a
buddy of mine that is I can I give a
shout out to someone who turned me onto
your channel sure is that okay he calls
himself cyber dirt and he used to work
for me in the uh now he lives uh back in
Massachusetts helping his aged mother
and I I wish him the best but he turned
me on to you a long time ago and we've
been following you for a long time and
he told me about that platform you were
trying to work on where people help each
other uh get ideas started I I forget
what it was called I can't remember it
are you still doing that
well uh the startup no so that that died
in the pandemic
it was like an app where you help each
other find um ways to do different
Professional Services oh you're it was
an app that a expert you could hire an
expert in any any topic got it yep
he tried he tried to tell me how that
would benefit me being I'm a technical
consultant and all that but it never
really came together hey I know you got
other people waiting but it's cool to
see that you're doing this I love it
that you're out in your garage that's
just totally Grassroots and uh you know
I keep doing what you're doing man stay
strong and I just wanted to give you
that idea that it'd be fun to get a
Google Voice number and that way you can
occasionally take live callers because
when when the end of the world comes we
all want to be watching and all of us
will be tuned in you never know when
it's going to implode right
I I think we got a few years
all right hey I'm in your channel on
YouTube is Craig talks so so if I say so
let me know like please don't boot me
permanently because I'm out here doing
my best and you can always hit me up I'd
be glad to help you with any technical
stuff even though I'm not a Mac guy all
right I'm pc5 take it easy Scott good to
see you all right thanks
all right ladies and gentlemen
um
I think that that's uh
let me just look here I think that
that's uh all the testing I needed so
the only thing I need to do now is
um the only thing I need to do now
is give rather get rid of that annoying
beeping
you would think that would be like
something that would be right
at that top of the list of things that
would be an obvious button to push
where is that
sound effects microphone up there we go
mute
I think I found it
was hidden in there
a little menu stream all right I need
somebody else to join so I can see if it
doesn't make a noise
can somebody else join
just to see if it doesn't make a noise
all right well I think it's fixed
all right that's all for now
um if you watch me on live stream
in the mornings I will see you there
and
I'll probably use this feature if I do a
like a serious interview
which I might do
especially when the political season
gets really jumping but that's all for
now let's see what happens where I hit
the Finish button
