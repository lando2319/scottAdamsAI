i'm here every day at the same time
well then that's something you can feel
good about isn't it
again you have succeeded and your day
has barely begun
so it's pretty much all coasting from
here on in would you like to take it to
another level
maybe maybe even higher
i know it doesn't seem possible does it
but we can do it watch this
all you need is a copper mug or glass of
anchor chelsea's diamond canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
can you feel it you can feel it a little
bit can't you it's the dopamine of the
day it's already starting to charge up
it's a little bit of oxytocin on top
it's the simultaneous sip but it's going
to happen now all over the world and
make you all feel amazing go
you know i keep waiting for this to not
work once
and it works every time
i don't know it's strange
talk about strange things
uh we'll see what's trending today on
twitter
uh
trending on twitter
uh okay it's me
it's me i'm trending on twitter
have i ever have i ever mentioned
how weird my life
is so i did a twitter thread about how
weird my life is
and it's trending on twitter today
and weirdly i guess it started trending
last night
and i had no idea so i guess i was i was
one of the biggest news stories in the
country
uh and it was the day i decided not to
look at twitter at night
i always look at twitter at night but
just one night
i was like i'm gonna take the night off
and i wake up this morning and
i'm getting messages about how i was
trending i'm like
what
it always reminds me that
it would be impossible for you to
understand
what it's like to be a public figure
because your your actual personal
experience is so divorced
from whatever anybody else is consuming
so while
while many people around
the country apparently were consuming
something about me
i was completely oblivious i was just
you know sipping my coffee petting my
dog
so we're going to talk about that tweet
to thread because it got me in a little
trouble or do you want to do that first
you want to do that first or do you want
to do the news first
quick vote
tweet thread first or news first
all right you know you wanted the tweet
thread come on
all right so here's what made me trend
i tweeted just before i logged off
yesterday
a number of weird things that have
happened to me
and i thought wouldn't it be interesting
to see people's lists of weird things
that have happened so i started it with
mine
and
i didn't realize it would cause so much
trouble
i thought it would just be
mildly interesting
i did not know that it would
trend nationally on twitter but here's
the the thread and it's just a number of
things that are weird that have happened
to me
um so it starts with a number of times a
real gun has been pointed at my head
five
now it turns out that a lot of people
thought that was a lie
uh has anybody else ever had a gun
pointed at him now
now i'm gonna i'm gonna confess to some
hyperbole okay
there's a whole bunch of people on the
local look at you look at how many
people have had a gun pointed at him
yeah oh my god
a lot of people have had a gun pointed
at him
holy cow
what what kind of a audience have i
attracted
well i'm a little bit worried
should should we just form a militia
if i could just take you aside for a
moment
i didn't realize how many of you have
been in active uh
inactive gun fights
one way or another
and uh
i feel as if
given that we've accidentally assembled
this particular audience
and many of you
many of you have been in gunfights i
think we should form our own militia
is everybody in
there won't be really any uh any
drilling
i'm not really
i'm just not much of a
drill sergeant
so i'll be the head of your militia
if you'd like to join
and the requirements are nothing nothing
you just have to say you're part of my
militia
but if i ever call you to action
should we ever need to defend the
country
against
foreign invaders or whatever
i will call you into action in our our
militia will assemble and
god help whoever
is against us
all right well number of times a real
gun was pointed at my head was five and
all of these have sort of a
a story behind them
i was a
bank teller in san francisco in
1979 80.
if you were a bank teller in san
francisco during those years
there was a pretty good chance you got
robbed at gunpoint
in fact it was so common
that there's a good chance that if you
banked at all like in person in san
francisco during those years
you were probably in a bank
during a bank robbery but didn't know it
because the bank robberies happen
silently
you you know bank robber will maybe put
a note
that says give me all your money i have
a gun
that happened to me once and it was that
case it was a uh a gun in the pocket
was it a gun
i don't know
i mean if somebody says
give me all your money and they if they
have a gun in their pocket and it looks
like they're pointing it at you i didn't
really ask to see it
so
there is some hyperbole in my five guns
in the sense that two of them were
you know guns sort of simulated behind
clothing
but the people simulating them were real
robbers
so the part that was not simulated
i was really being robbed
so
were there guns i don't know
but it felt like it
so the experience was similar to
as if there were so two were
two times it happened
in the course of my job it is unusual to
be robbed twice
but even within my bank there were
people who had been robbed twice
in their job as a teller so it wasn't it
wasn't that uncommon
yeah it happened within my own bank
a few times
um but the reason you don't hear about
it is the
it's a silent alarm
so all you know is that somebody went up
to a teller window and they left
sometimes with a bag of something
you wouldn't even know the bank had been
robbed
so
and those two two of them was just
mugged on the streets
san francisco was kind of dangerous then
and
if you don't have much money you end up
in bad neighborhoods i lived in the hate
uh which was kind of a rough
neighborhood probably still is i don't
know
but at night it wasn't a safe place
and then one of them was a prank i've
told you about this at least on locals i
think i was walking down the street in
the mission district
and i heard somebody say hey
and there was an open window you know
right close to the sidewalk it was one
of those situations where the the window
and the sidewalk of a residential home
were really close
and
somebody pointed out the window with a
very real gun
now i say it was real because i got to
see her really close
i mean way closer than you want to see a
gun pointed at your head and he pulled
the trigger
i got to watch the
you know the rotation of the chamber
but there was not a round in
the chamber and that he laughed
it was pretty funny for the people in
the room
i i he may even tell that story about my
reaction it was priceless
priceless i tell you yes it was a
revolver
um sorry i don't have all the i don't
have all my gun terms
you know the interesting thing is
that with both the well actually all of
the robberies
you don't really get
scared in the moment
all of the adrenaline
has sort of a time delay so since all of
the actual dangerous parts really happen
quickly
there's this moment where you're sort of
you're more surprised than anything else
and you're like wait is this real so
there's a moment of figuring out if it's
real and what's really happening
and then once you realize that it is
real and is really happening
it's almost over
by the time it's over
your body is you know goes to you know
defcon 50
and stays there for a while
but the danger is already passed by then
but when it's in it you you actually are
just sort of cool and
weirdly calm
uh so yeah i've looked down
to uh
two gun barrels directly
uh and the other ones i say there's some
hyperbole here because i don't know if
the other ones were real guns they were
simulated guns behind clothing
and i don't know if they were pointing
at my head
they might have been pointing at my
torso so there's a little hyperbole in
there
um
let's see here here's the next one
number of times my car stereo has been
stolen four
i think is more
but i could remember distinctly at least
four i think it's five there was a time
when i had the kind of cars they had the
kind the kind of
um
stereos or aftermarket they were really
easy to take out so you just break the
window and rip it out again this was san
francisco actually no two of these were
in the east bay where i live now
in the parking lot of the
health club
a number of times my home or garage have
been burgled
five
so
once i came home and the door was open
to my apartment and had been burgled the
others were garages
so it's fairly common where i live
there's somebody will rummage through
your garage and steal your
you know whatever they can carry out so
the other four were with the garage
now
is that hyperbole
a little bit you know is it garage
burglary because usually it means you
you left the door open and you went to
sleep
but it does mean somebody was in your
home
you know in the interior
sometimes they were in your car
you know you can see that they've
rummaged around in your car that sort of
thing
a number of times i've been assaulted at
knifepoint
twice
not stabbed you know nobody stabbed me
but twice i've been in a conflict where
somebody had a knife and was threatening
to use it
once was a mugging
again on the street of san francisco
that was a pretty big knife it was sort
of the
like
kitchen knife bowie knife i don't know
what the hell it was but it's a big damp
knife
and then the other ones was a uh
uh amateur sporting competition that
went bad
sometimes in soccer games
uh a little violence breaks out but only
once did somebody brandish a knife in my
direction
but that was de-escalated
all right number of times someone stole
more than 50 000
from me
i estimated five to seven times
now of course a lot of people said well
that can't be true or what the hell are
you doing or what kind of an idiot are
you that so many people could steal so
much money
and
i don't know what the experience is of
other people who
have substantial
money
and also have been involved in a number
of businesses
but let me tell you this
if you own a small business and you
don't manage it yourself
sooner or later there's going to be a
manager or somebody who's hired to be
like the
assistant manager or somebody associated
with it who's going to figure out how to
start trickling things out the door
so in that kind of a business nobody's
going to steal 50 000 in one go
it's going to be
you know 4 000 a year for several years
that sort of thing
very common and
you know i can confirm that those things
happen
so what one was a bookkeeper from an old
business
does anybody know the deal burrito
the deal burrito was i tried to make a
a frozen dill burrito
a burrito that was had all your vitamins
and minerals it didn't work as a company
because we couldn't quite nail it and i
didn't believe the science after a while
because i don't think that nutrition
science
really suggests you should have that
much in terms of minerals and vitamins i
think it's a lot of guessing
anyway uh the bookkeeper
forged a check stole fifty thousand
dollars
got caught
right was prosecuted
so i i'm not saying that they all got
away with it and i lost the money
in some cases i got it back
um and i won't mention the other the
other examples because um in only some
cases were people prosecuted in other
cases
there were let's say extenuating
circumstances
or somebody got away with it for one
reason or another
right it's just unfortunately it's just
the cost of having money and being
involved in a lot of businesses
if you if you said uh
how many times has elon musk lost fifty
thousand dollars or more
oh i'll bet it's a lot
some of them he might have may have
detected some of them maybe he didn't i
don't know or maybe he just does a
better job of of watching his shop
homes in my neighborhood all right and
as you might have guessed i live in a
very low crime area
it's a high-end
average house in my neighborhood
probably
and
2.5 million dollars something like that
in california that's not as big as you'd
imagine
but this is a high-end ish neighborhood
and uh it's a high-end neighborhood
i'll take it i'll take out the ish i
know how awful that sounded as soon as i
said it
um
but two of them have been targeted by
smash and steel gangs you know the south
american gangs
that break into your back door usually
they usually come over a fence or
something get in the back breakthrough
window
go directly for any jewelry upstairs and
then leave
before anybody can come so my next-door
neighbor
my literal next-door neighbor
was taken down by a smashing uh
out of whatever smash and steel gang
and one a little bit further away but
just you know walking distance just down
the street
so
when you ask yourself how safe are
things
there's no such thing as a safe
neighborhood anymore
if let me tell you
literally the name
i won't say that but i do live in just
about the safest place
that also has a population
and
you can see that it's not safe here i
mean this is one of the places
where i've been robbed i've lost all of
my tools in my garage
twice
i hate that because i'm a tool collector
i like having tools that i don't even
need
it's just sort of one of those male
fetishes you know you just like having a
lot of tools sometimes i have two of
things that i really didn't need two of
right i mean men man you understand this
sometimes you just need lots and lots of
pliers
there's no such thing as too many pliers
of different types for different things
right but i've had my whole collection
wiped down twice including all the
electric
drills and everything
so those are two of the robberies
um a number of major auto accidents i've
been in three
um wasn't injured in any of them but
they were major major damage of the
automobile or completely off the road in
one case
a number of incurable health issues i
cured in myself
now again
it kind of depends how you read it right
if you think i cured it like jesus
oh
you're cured
well then that didn't happen
but if you think that i had three
conditions let's say
they were considered incurable
but i got a good result by
hard work and you know just pressing on
it
then that's true
and you all know the story once i lost
my
ability to speak but long long story i
hunted down the one surgeon who had a
still experimental surgery and got it
fixed but it was considered incurable
it just happened to i found the one
doctor who didn't didn't think so
the other was a focal dystonia
both the first one and this one are
actually brain misfires in a similar
region that causes a muscle to do
something it's not supposed to they
often operate in pairs so the other was
i lost my ability ability to draw with
my left hand it would spasm when i tried
to draw the hand was fine because it's a
brain misfire it's not there's nothing
wrong with muscles or anything
and that was incurable
and the advice was quit your job because
you're not going to be drawing with that
hand you can do everything else with it
you could play an instrument anything
you want it just will never be used for
that
but
i joined an experimental group to see if
we could figure out some way to fix it
with you know massage or biofeedback or
we we tried a bunch of stuff just to see
if anybody could come up with anything
but one of the things i tried
was
i guess you'd say it there's a word for
it where you sort of
sneak up on the behavior you're trying
to get to
so since i knew that my hand would spasm
if i tried to draw
instead i would just put the pen in my
hand and put the pen to paper
and then lift it up immediately
so that my brain would see me putting
pen to paper
without spasming and i just do it a lot
and then after a while i can hold it
there for a second before taking it off
before a spasm and then the second
turned into five seconds and i wouldn't
even try to draw i would just rest it on
the piece of paper
because just being there was
the trigger it wasn't even moving
and then eventually you got to about 10
seconds
when it hit about 30 seconds
one day
my brain rewired
and and i actually recovered my ability
to draw for
over a decade i forget i forget how long
it was but for about a decade i
had cured an incurable problem
now more recently
i reinjured it
and so is back
but at the moment i'm sure i could do
the same thing and probably recover it
again but it takes a long time so
instead i thought wouldn't it be make
more sense to just draw left-handed
because i have an art assistant now who
can do the finished stuff if if mine is
a little bit off now it gets fixed by my
assistant
so i just trained myself to draw
left-handed and
now i'll have the backup because i
always wanted to back up anyway
so
that's two
incurable conditions
that i worked my way through and the
third one was pyresis or shy bladder
that's the same thing the inability to
use a public restroom
for reasons that again are sort of
mysterious something like i don't know
two to five percent of the public have
it
but nobody
people tend to think they're the only
ones who haven't
and it turns out
that learning you're not the only one
who has it
is kind of a cure
now not for everybody and not in every
situation
but
simply um
putting it out in public
and telling everybody you know
that you can't you know urinate in those
situations
and it turns out to be the cure so uh
when i found out that first of all it
was genetic ran in the family
and secondly i wasn't the only one at it
my brother actually is
active in helping other people
understand it and he actually cured me
he cured me simply by telling me what it
was
and that other people have it
and it's completely you know just sort
of a normal statistical thing like
like a lot of other things
and that
if you do uh graduated exposure
meaning you you you put yourself in
increasingly difficult situations
meaning let's say there's somebody
outside the door but nearby
which would have been impossible at one
point for me
i would have to be behind the closed
door
but also know that there was nobody
around right
but
once you get to the point where you can
do that
you can you know
ratchet it up so at this point i don't
have problems traveling
can you imagine what traveling or just
going to work
were like if you didn't have access to a
restroom and you didn't know when you
ever would
it
it was it was hell
it was like the worst thing in the world
but it was a private hell that nobody
would know i was having it was an
internal one
as soon as i found out it was a thing
and the other people have it
thirty percent of it was solved
and then i started chunking away i would
say it's
it's somewhere in the neighborhood of
eighty percent solved at this point
which is good enough
to pretty much do anything i want so it
doesn't have any limitation on my life
at this point
so in the old days if i wanted to use a
restroom let's say i was with a group at
dinner
i'd have to sneak away
because if you said you were going to
use the restroom sometimes another guy
would get up and say oh yeah i got to
use it too
and you know as if you were going to
stand shoulder-to-shoulder doing our
business because that wasn't going to
work
but
once i learned that i could do this i'd
say i'm going to use restroom and some
other guy would say oh i'm going to use
it too
then i just announced to everybody at
the table oh i can't use a restroom when
you're in there too
i'm you know i have shy bladder
so why don't you go and you know i'll go
after you
just tell the whole table because
remember i told you it's like a super
power when you get past your
embarrassment
as soon as you as soon as you live an
embarrassment-free life everything's
easy
you just you just announce to the table
well let me tell you i got this thing i
can't quite urinate like you can so you
got two options either i go first and
you wait or you go first and then i'll
go
and problem solved and you know also
happened often
often somebody else at the table would
just say you know i have the same
problem
and then it becomes a conversation and
then you end up curing somebody at the
table
literally you end up curing somebody
else just because it's the first time
they learned they're not the only one
it's just the weirdest thing all right
so those are three
um medically
presumed incurable conditions at one
point at this point there's better
understanding that i work through
now is there some hyperbole involved
there i don't know
um
number of full days of vacation that had
no work in them whatsoever
that i have taken in the past 33 years
now that would be the period since i
started doing the cartoon
and i said five or so
but i don't remember five
i don't actually remember five of them i
don't know if there was even one
actually
i just put five because i didn't think
it could be zero
and the trick here is that
i like to work when i first wake up
so if i'm on vacation
i'm almost certainly going to at least
be doing my email or my
something well i'm drinking my coffee
and it's
three hours before anybody else wakes up
it's just sort of a perfect time to get
some stuff done
so i i don't feel comfortably i don't
feel comfortable taking 24 hours without
doing anything productive at all
and because most of my stuff is thinking
or writing or drawing i can almost
always do some of it while i'm having my
coffee
enjoying waking up just thinking about
life just totally enjoying it
even on my honeymoon correct
yes even on my honeymoon because do you
know how many hours
i'm awake in the morning
before any
anybody who would marry me
[Laughter]
right it's always the same i mean i
would have like two to three hours
of alone time every morning
so so that's not as uh
yeah it sounds like i'm a
like a overworker or something but it
really has more to do with the fact that
i enjoy using the first hour to do
something useful a number of times i was
disciplined by my parents or teachers
during my childhood
zero
it just never came up
i mean maybe like i'm thinking that
maybe when i was six years old or
something
you know probably my mother yelled at me
or something i don't know
maybe but from
let's say the age of
i don't know
probably eight years old
i'm i'm pretty sure
nothing like a punishment ever happened
or even a scolding that i can remember
now it wasn't because my
parents were you know hands off
is because i just never had any desire
to
to be a pain in the ass
for example
one of the things that's hard to get a
kid to do is to show up on time
you know to to wake up on time to just
do stuff on time
but
i don't think i was ever a kid
because probably the first time it was
ever explained to me you know
five years old or something you know you
should be on time
because that's good for everybody and
then they'll do it for you and if
everybody just shows up on time
everything works better and then you
have something to depend on and you know
everybody will think better of you and
i was probably five years old the first
time i
understood
why people are on time
and then after that i never really saw a
reason to be late
what was it for me
it just didn't seem like a good strategy
so there were just all these behaviors
that i just
never really got into i just didn't see
the reason and it was a small town so
there wasn't much you know there weren't
as many ways to get in trouble
and then in school i don't know
just never happened
it wasn't that i didn't do anything
wrong in in terms of things that you
could punish somebody for
i either didn't get caught or
or something talked my way out of it i
don't know um
no here's here's one number
i just added this this morning because
when i saw that it was trending
i uh
when i saw this was trending
i immediately added some more uh red
meat
so i added this one a number of people i
have cured of their various health
problems via public advice
thousands
i've probably helped thousands of people
just on pyresis alone
because again just telling about about
it is 30 of the cure
um
i've probably helped
dozens to possibly hundreds of people
cure their voice problems because they
found out through me because i worked to
make sure they found out
that there was a surgical
solution
so just telling people that the solution
existed
presumably led some number of people to
get the solution
uh how many people have told me on live
streams
and other ways
that my books especially had a filled
almost everything they still would make
got them to quit drinking quit smoking
or lose a lot of weight
or exercise
a lot
hundreds thousands hundreds have told me
i don't know how many people have
actually done those things but if you if
you consider let's say obesity is a
medical problem and i think that would
be a fair
statement then i've actually cured
thousands of people of a pretty serious
medical problem obesity at least that's
what they tell me i mean it's not like
i'm
studying it myself but people are
telling me they've lost massive weight
stopped drinking
and it's because they're creating
systems
based on how i taught people to create
systems in my book kind of failed almost
everything and still win big
um
so
here's the funniest part about this is
how many people believed
some or all of these were lies
and
it really tells you something about i
don't know either my reputation or
something about people
or or something
because
even the
what was his name uh
what's his freaking name
who's the
the
the most insane guy that used to be on
msnbc keith olbermann
yeah so even keith olbermann took a run
at me every
every few years he comes down from his
rock or wherever he lives
to insult me in public i don't know
keith obama has just some kind of
problem with me that i've never quite
understood
and
uh
and basically he called up
now you just heard the detailed
explanation
do you think my claims assuming that i
the story i told you is true and they
all are true
now do you think the the claims are
overstated
see the whole point of it was probably
everybody has could make a list
that is unique to them
i think now do you think that mine is
unusual
because i think
i think there are a lot of people have
like escaped death twice
you know they could have their own
amazing stories of
you know that they had to kill somebody
something like that yeah
exactly all right so so that that that's
exactly what i was looking for so over
on youtube somebody said
that uh i'm nearly 65 years old
happens that that's the point
at my age
the number of things that should blow
your mind just that are normal because i
lived a long life
it should be a lot if you're say 30
years old
it should just blow your mind
how many just interesting things happen
but but i believe that would be true of
almost all of you by the same age
i think everybody would have some weird
stories all right let's talk about some
other things so on
uh
so that that's how slow a news day was
that i was trending
all right uh in ukraine
uh this will surprise you a lot but uh
there are more reports of atrocities
why
because it's another day and it's a war
zone and there's propaganda and there
probably are atrocities
but
we don't really believe
all of them to be exactly accurate do we
so what do you do with this it's like
news that isn't news
it's just permanent news now i if you
wake up tomorrow let me predict the
headline tomorrow
i predict that if i go to cnn
tomorrow
there will be news about a
possible war crime atrocity happening in
ukraine
maybe it was the one that happened last
time maybe they found a new one
but if you know it's going to be the
story
i don't know what to make of it because
you know it's either propaganda or real
but we'll never know
and of course mary paul who
is completely surrounded and getting
beaten to submission by the russians
have not surrendered
what is going on there
you know
and and the the two movies are now
firmly entrenched
one is that the russians are obviously
winning have been obviously winning
since the beginning and will obviously
win
whatever it is they want
and i would say the evidence
clearly supports that point of view
but at the same time
there are plenty of people and i've been
in this camp
who look at it and saying you know
there's one thing that's really weird
about
predicting the future
and that is we're never really
um
aware of tipping points
and that
as long as ukraine holds on and i did
predict that they'd have enough modern
technology to slow the russian advance
as long as they hold on
there's always some chance
that something in this weird give and
take of you know each
side pushing the other off balance and
trying to get their
get their support systems and their uh
their supply routes and stuff and the
ukraines are taking out the generals and
they're working on the morale
but all of these things on both sides
are very near a tipping point
wouldn't you say
wouldn't you say that the russian
fighting morale
is probably
somewhere close to a tipping point
right but i don't know how close
some people are saying no
and i i would respect that
my because my point is that that we're
not good at knowing when a tipping point
is coming
so if i say to you we might be reaching
a tipping point and the vast majority of
you scream no we're not
the in terms of the russian fighting
morale that's nowhere near a tipping
point it doesn't refute my point it
actually supports it because my point is
you can't see tipping points coming they
happen sort of suddenly and then in
retrospect you go you know
i guess we should have seen it coming
all those examples
so the supply chain situation this
looks like it's at a tipping point for
both sides
the the naval superiority might be at a
tipping point we might be bringing
enough in enough
anti-aircraft weapons there might be
some change in the in the air cover
there could be something about
you know
just availability of parts
there could be something about the
weather changing to be
let's say rainier
if it gets too rainy you know what does
that change
what kinds of weapons are getting in and
how quickly
to ukraine
i have a feeling
that there's just no way to know which
of these many things are near tipping
points and if any one of these things
tips
it looks like you know the house of
cards comes down because the supply
chain
is not like a small thing right if
somebody if either side supply chain
breaks well it's over
right if if something changed with uh
russia's control of the air
and they don't have full control i guess
but let's say they went to no control
oh that would change things quite a bit
what if the number of uh
switchblade drones and people who know
how to operate them goes from dozens
to
a
thousand and maybe a thousand operators
with multiple drones each i mean could
that happen could they have 30 000
switchblade drones
and if they could how long would it take
and what happened if they came in some
big deliveries and suddenly
ukraine just started going wild with the
switchblade drones those are the ones
that can hover over a target they're
small ones
they can hover over a target make sure
they know what they're aiming at and
then dive down and kill it because it
seems to be if you had enough
switchblade drones
you could with 100 certainty
take out the supply chains of the other
side
couldn't you
i mean i feel like you could be it just
as is a question
more knows
i all right i'm going to say it's only a
question of the number of them
if you're saying there's no number of
switchblade drones that could change the
direction of the war
um
you know
it may be impossible to get that many
especially if possible to train people
and maybe it's impossible
to get close enough to the stuff you
want to kill but i don't think so if you
i think you could get within a few
kilometers of almost anything in a war
so
i don't know
i'm not going to bet against ukraine but
i i think
if you had to look at the odds
you say it just is whether or not putin
wants to get what he wants if he wants
to pay for it
and it's pretty expensive
but yeah he'll get it
philadelphia is talking about masks
coming back ah
that's my only comment
uh border patrol says at least 23 people
coming across the southern border
in 2021 were on the terror watch list
what missing from the story
their nationalities
are there
were there really that many
people from central and south america
or from mexico that were on the terror
watch list
shouldn't we know where they came from
like what countries they came from
i feel like the most important part of
the story is left out
because if there were and i don't think
this is the case but if there were 23
you know mexican nationals who were on
the terrorist watch list and they got
across the border
what's happening in mexico that we don't
know about like did they did they turn
into isis or something and if they're
not mexican
well where the hell are they coming from
like what countries is it middle east
i mean how do you even get on that watch
list i don't know
um
here's the dumbest tweet i saw today
adam kinzinger was tweeting at tucker
carlson and he tweeted a
video that was in a tweet by some group
called canadian ukrainian volunteers so
in other words it's a pro-ukrainian
video
that alleges the show mass desertion of
russian troops
and the video
shows all of their gear boots and
um
and stuff just laying on the ground
so the purported uh video well the video
is real but
their interpretation of what's on the
video is that you're seeing that the
russian soldiers were so
ready to desert that they ripped off all
their gear in their clothing and found
some civilian clothes and melted into
the population
and the video
shows a a patch of the ground with this
this gear
that's about the size of one room and a
house
and it never shows more than like
this little patch of dirt
and adam kinzinger took that one video
of that little patch of dirt with
nothing in it except
russian looking
materials and
accepted the interpretation
that there might be mass desertion of
russian troops
really
really
let me suggest at least one other
hypothesis
this is not something i believe to be
true
this is just something that could be
true based on the same video
well actually two things number one
the ukrainians are making lots of
propaganda video they got a bunch of
russian stuff from
soldiers that they had already killed
they put it in a pile they took a little
video of the little pile of stuff from
the the dead russian soldiers and then
they made made it look like there was a
mass desertion
which is more likely
that the russian soldiers are literally
throwing off their clothing
and running for it or that it's a
propaganda video just like every one we
see every day that looks exactly like
it's a propaganda video and you can't
even hardly imagine it's not a
propaganda video
but there's a third possibility
and this is the one i want to be very
careful because i'll be kicked off of
every platform
so i don't want to make the mistake
of of saying that my speculation
is based on proof for that is true
so what i say next
would be an alternative explanation
for the same
video
that has no evidence for it whatsoever
okay
i hope i've set the stage
do you remember the uh videos of the uh
massacres in um was it buca where where
what where the
adult men had their hands tied behind
their backs they were wearing civilian
clothes and they sure looked like
ukrainians
and they had been
obviously executed
yeah
now
if and again this is speculation and i'm
not alleging this to be true
if you wanted to create a bunch of uh
corpses that look like ukrainians
wouldn't you take
a bunch of russians who had already been
dead or you were about to kill them
say put on take off your russian clothes
drop your gear right there
put on these r these uh ukrainian
clothes and turn your back
pow
and now we're going to pose you in the
streets and we're going to say that the
russians did this and that these are
ukrainian dead because you can't tell
the difference when you look at them
and
and then we'll take a picture of all
their gear and then secondarily we'll
get a second propaganda hit by saying
that the russians are doing a mass
desertion by showing all the gear that
we told them to take off
now i'm not saying that happened
and
and i'm i think it's unlikely that
happened actually
so
that's no
you know not
it's just a speculation about
alternative explanations i don't believe
that that's actually literally what
happened in this case
but i also don't think you should tweet
a video like this around as if there's
one explanation for it
because there are three
and i don't know which one is better
frankly
uh yeah there's there's a non-zero
possibility for all of those things
that's true but actually far bigger than
non-zero i think
which would be more to the point
that ladies and gentlemen
brings us to the conclusion of the
prepared portion of our program i don't
think you've ever had a better time
honestly except listening to me yammer
about myself
okay maybe i should have saved that for
the man cave episodes i do just for the
local subscribers
i know i know
but remember i told you that it was such
a slow news day that i actually was in
the news today
so that's not my fault i did not do that
intentionally i wanted the news to be
about other people because that's more
comfortable for me too
but at least this one i knew how to talk
about it i didn't have to do a lot of
preparation to talk about myself
uh can we see the mustang
um
i don't like to post stuff like that
it's bad enough talking about it but
yeah i don't think i want to post that
um
stevens or stefan says i'm your biggest
fan can i get a fact check on that true
that's true
there are a lot of people who say to me
i'm your biggest fan
but it's never been true it's always
been stefan
or stephen
or
step hand i don't know how to pronounce
that i'm going to call you step hand
oh there was a video that
i would imagine might be another fake
video
so there's a video of zelinski
sniffing and you know somebody's
indicating it looks like he's on cocaine
or something
now i have
two comments on that number one most
likely fake news propaganda
you know could you might have had a
allergies could have anything could have
been crying about something he has lots
to cry about i guess
so it could have been anything he's
always an actor yeah but um
let me ask you this if you were in his
position
could you get through it without taking
drugs
now assume he has access to pretty much
anything he wants right he's still the
leader of the country
the capital is still sort of up and sort
of running a little bit so he must have
a doctor
and he must know
that
sleeping's a bad idea in this situation
you know you got to be at your best
is there any chance he's not on
something
i mean
i feel that's one of those situations
where even the the doctor is going to
bend a rule and say you know
i wouldn't normally
give you this stimulant
but we also need to win the war so maybe
temporarily we'll we'll bend the rules a
little bit here
yeah
so i'm not sure that i care
i'm not sure it's a story that some that
a war leader may or may not be taking
some
let's say performance enhancing
chemistry
now some people are saying it's coke
because he was sniffling
i'm not even sure i would care about
that
i mean
he's doing a job that nobody wants right
nobody wants to be the the war leader
so i mean if he's got to do
he's got to do
dangerous drugs just to get through it
i don't know i'm not even sure i would
judge it i'm not even sure we've ever
had a leader during a ward and wasn't on
drugs
i'm not sure you can get through it i
mean
you're either going to need an upper to
handle it or you're going to need
something to put you to sleep
but if you tell me that our war
presidents were not taking some kind of
drug at least you know say in the last
50 years or so i'd be pretty surprised
pretty surprised
my thoughts on mushrooms we've talked
about mushrooms a lot so i don't think
i'll do that one again right now
by the way mushrooms are not going away
if there's one thing you could
i think you could predict with complete
certainty
is that the direction of mushroom use is
going to skyrocket
and for medically valid reasons
so
also recreationally
but i think the recreational users will
discover enough life benefits that will
actually change their mind
about it being a recreational drug
uh you know this is the weirdest thing
i'll bet most of the people who
experience mushrooms
most let's say 60 or something i'll just
put an opinion out there with no backing
whatsoever
i'll bet most of people start do it for
fun
and then after they do it they're like
did i get some kind of lasting benefit
from that i think i might have
so i think they come for the fun and
they stay for the benefit
but you don't have to stay forever
that's the wonderful thing about
at least what we know about mushrooms we
we could be surprised in the future but
from a strictly medical perspective
i don't know anybody who's ever been
addicted
in fact it might work the opposite way
you know i've heard of people micro
dosing on lsd and i've heard of people
like they'll take a few years where
they're like really doing a lot of lsd
but it's kind of rare for somebody to
just do it all the time
you know for years like alcohol
i i feel as if what those drugs do is
they make you not need them anymore
in other words it
it puts your mind in a way that you're
more i think the word was flexible
people studying what happens when you're
on psychedelics is your brain gets more
flexible so it can get out of a loop
so if you're in a little loop about
feeling bad about yourself oh i feel
worthless i feel bad it's like a little
loop
when you take the psychedelics your
brain just is willing to think about
more things
so the loop doesn't go away
it's just you're not you're not paying
attention to it you're just
you're just more interested in different
things
so all your little loops
uh atrophy
and you and you you take with you
or at least some people do take with you
the ability to reframe things
have you noticed a couple of things
coming together
when i talk about reframing
and
it's something you'll hear a lot more
about it's about simply a different way
of looking at the same situation that
can make it go from bad news to good
news or important unimportant just by
the way you you choose to put a mental
frame on it
well your ability to reframe things
is pretty directly affected
by your experience of accidentally
saying things in different frames
because you can't believe that the brain
can just say all right i choose to look
at it in a different way
and then you just do
right if you've never experienced it
that doesn't seem like a thing
like like how do you just oh i'll just
think of it differently and then i'll go
from unhappy to happy
sounds ridiculous
but you do mushrooms or some of the
other hallucinogens i've heard
and it automatically makes you look at
ordinary things in completely different
ways
and then you say to yourself um
you actually can look at exactly the
same stuff
and know how to use it right even if
you're using mushrooms you still know
how to use your phone
like everything is the same
but you still see it differently you you
process it differently it
it feels differently to you you're you
no longer have the same association with
it you did you now have flexibility to
to think of it in a different way
and you take that with you you take with
you the understanding that you can
simply
look at it at things a different way and
it changes your your whole impression of
life
yeah it's the great reset exactly
oh the great reset is coming
it just happens to be mushrooms
now for this conversation
uh let me say to be a good citizen and i
like to throw this in all the time i'm
not a doctor and i don't recommend
mushrooms
i can tell you what my experience with
them was but i'm one person i can't tell
you the danger of them so this is a
medical decision only
and
uh they are medically approved in some
limited context already so that's you
know that's the part that
is important
so don't do drugs kids uh
unless you're in a medically supervised
situation
yeah glad i'm not going to talk about it
today i couldn't help it i'm sorry
the
the curiosity about this topic
is just through the roof
and that's also how you know
it's going somewhere
nicotine for productivity you know i
hate the fact that that's true
have you ever thought of fixing your own
plumbing
wall stoned
um
i know my limits and plumbing
is beyond them
i've told you before that i'm in a uh a
simulation
in which i have continuous uh water
related problems so i live in a drought
area my house has every kind of leak
and today again
another plumbing related problem
so is my in this in this case it's my
hot water dispenser
it's it's dispensing some debris along
with the water
so once again
get the plumber it's pretty much ever
pretty much every two weeks
um
thoughts on the degradation of american
culture
oh you know
here's the thing
is there a degradation of american
culture or is it just changing
and are we afraid of change
because that's natural
or is it really worse
or is it better in some ways
and worse than some but we don't notice
the better part and we're focusing on
the worse
let me ask you this
uh would you want to go back to the
culture 40 years ago if you had to take
all of it
so here's a question for all of you
would you want to go back
to the the american culture of 40 years
ago but you have to take all of it
all the discrimination
all the ignorance
some people say yes
well if you say yes you're probably
white and male aren't you
is there anybody who isn't
white and male who wants to go back to
40 years ago
so so here's my point
i definitely understand that for some
people
it was better
it just wasn't better for everybody
there's a reason stuff changes right not
everything's changing for the worse
to me it seems that if you could trade
if you could trade what we've gained in
understanding each other's worth
for i don't know what we lost in
uh going to church on sunday which is
valuable which is valuable i'm i'm pro
going to church on sunday if it works
for you
i feel like we gained more than we lost
it's just that we are by
by nature
we focus on what's wrong which is why we
do so well as a species
you know the the good thing about humans
is we can't stop looking at what's wrong
we're just so focused on what we're
doing wrong
and
take it take a look at the world just
coordinated for covid
the entire world
the entire world
just coordinated to keep each other
alive
that actually happened
so would you want to go back to 40 years
ago i don't know could we have done that
we didn't really have the internet so
maybe it would have been harder
somebody says yes
yeah i don't know
it seems to me that on almost every
dimension
maybe
95 of things
that we're better off
and we just then we just incorporate
them into well that's just how things
are it's not really improvement of
course you know seriously here's the
problem
since you can't really put yourself in
the mindset of 40 years ago
not really even if you were there you
can't really do it
you accept that treating everybody
as as having equal worth
is something that was just always
natural and normal and
of course
but that wasn't really the case 40 years
ago
was it
not so much
so
i
i don't know
i'm not sure i would go back but if if
what you're talking about is the
um let's say the
the benefit of the traditional family
you know more religiosity
stuff like that maybe the schools were a
little less
propagandish and more basic
yeah all those things are good oh this
is good and it would be it would be
awesome if we had more of it but i do
think that the nuclear family just
doesn't work for everybody
my best guess is that then that a
standard
parents stay married forever nuclear
family is great
for 30 of the country
great
and i wish that they could have all of
that and enjoy it fully in fact you
could argue that's the best
part of the country because they're
going to be creating the the functional
children
you know they're they're the ones who
are going to be creating children who
are more likely
to do something that creates the next
you know unicorn startup
so so yeah i i have great respect for a
system that
i also acknowledge just doesn't work for
everybody you know
you just need to give everybody a chance
for the same level of happiness you know
they have to work for it
but everybody needs a shot at it i don't
think i just don't think
a standard family works for just a lot
of people for a lot of different reasons
i mean you know if if you're an
alcoholic for example
10 of the
population
what's better
you're an alcoholic and you become a
parent
is that better than you're an alcoholic
and you decide okay
i'll be in some other situation where
my situation doesn't damage any children
well
i don't know
it's a free world so you can go either
way and
because we value freedom i'm not sure i
would i would judge you
because i'm sure i make decisions you
don't like either that's that's how it
works
right why are we getting this
dumb commercial on here go away
put user in timeout
all right uh
can we get a micro lesson on reframing
work into play
that's a tough one because it really
depends on what kind of work you're
doing you just can't do that with
everything
oh
oh
the the most fun story of the day
um did you see a
tweet by uh naval
ravikant
i want to i want to
see his exact words
say it because i retweeted it
um
and
so here's why it's interesting so naval
here it is
uh so if you don't know naval uh rubicon
is
generally considered and this would be
my opinion one of the smartest people
um certainly in the tech world in
silicon valley in the startup world but
maybe just in the world
he's just one of the smartest people in
the world and uh he
he would be like what mark twain would
be if mark twain
had been a lot smarter
so he tweets a lot about you know how to
live a happy life and be successful and
stuff and it's all like gold
so
but he's also famously non-political
right like you don't
he doesn't fall into any category which
is also why he's credible
and so he weighed in on this twitter
elon muslin and this is what he tweeted
and listen to every word in it
just listen to every word and really
just pay attention to the exact way he
says this
twitter is the simplest open message
broadcasting protocol
like all protocols it converges toward a
winner take all monopoly
a monopoly that can dictate who gets
heard and who gets silenced a monopoly
that can overthrow governments
of course we're going to fight over it
now
here's what's interesting
so you got elon musk on one side of this
and then there's some other people on
the other side the sort of max boot
famously
might be against this
but have you noticed the
correlation between the people who are
on elon musk's side and the people who
are not
all of the smartest people in the tech
world
are on elon musk's side
all of them
the smartest people in the world
they're all on his side
now
if it were just elon musk
against i guess you know the biden
administration and against twitter's
board and against all the critics he'd
still have a good shot
wouldn't you say
based on his history you say elon musk
versus the whole government
i like his chances
but now what happens if you add in you
know mark andreessen
you know one of the most influential
successful venture people
um
what does peter teal think
i don't know
but if i had to take a gas
[Laughter]
probably on the same side now bezos is a
special case right because he's a
competitor
that doesn't count
um
so i've got a feeling that when you see
naval say of course we're going to fight
over it that sounds like it
a non-aligned statement doesn't it
of course we're going to fight over it
so it's just a statement of the
condition
but
that's not exactly how i read it
now i can't read his mind
and if i could then
then you know that would be magic
so i don't know exactly what he meant by
this but i'll tell you the way i
interpret it
that
there are going to be a lot of people on
the elon bus side
let's just say it that way
and that a lot of those people are
insanely capable
and if you think that elon musk won't
succeed because he hasn't thought of all
the strategic ways to go
or that there's not enough
firepower behind them
you better rethink that
because the most powerful people in the
world whose names you haven't heard
are all lighting up behind them
right
now if you're sort of
you know live closer to this world some
of these names you when you hear them
you go
that person too
and it's starting to get obvious
that there is a an alignment of
like-minded people
who are just the most powerful people on
the planet who don't have an elected
position
and they're about to express their will
and and
again i don't want to over interpret and
default that wouldn't that wouldn't be
fair
but the way i read it
so this is just on me
is uh he just joined the fight
so if you were going to predict how this
goes
um
just know that uh this
that
there's a lot of power on one side a lot
so that's that's all so i'll leave you
with that
and
i'll talk to you tomorrow youtube
