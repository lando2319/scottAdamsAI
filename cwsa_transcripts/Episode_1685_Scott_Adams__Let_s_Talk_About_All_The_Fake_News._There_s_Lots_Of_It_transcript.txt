[Music]
well ladies and gentlemen
if i were
prepared and my printer were working
i would be looking at my notes right now
but despite my best efforts to make that
printer produce something
it does not
did i say the sound is bad
check that printer yes i might
let's see what's going on
hold on
sometimes you just have to scare them
is it my imagination or did that work
i think it's starting to print
i'm watching this with a great
excitement
because there's a really good chance if
this doesn't print
i'm going to smash it on the tile floor
so this is kind of exciting
if this doesn't print
how much would you like to see me raise
it above my head
and smash it on my floor on camera
i did it with my last printer
i'll do it with as many printers as it
takes
uh oh
let's see what message it has
this will determine if it lives or dies
[Applause]
you know if i were inventing a printer
i would invent it so it told me when it
was on the paper
just before i smashed it on the ground
oh it looks like we'll have a show today
could happen
hold on
all right
my god
could i be
less organized could i be
let's pretend none of this has ever
happened
rewind
good morning everybody and welcome
to the
best thing that ever happened to you
now
it was close
we almost had a situation here
but
apparently my printer doesn't tell me
when it's out of paper the first time
you got to beat it up a little bit and
then it reveals its secrets
i just shook that printer and made it
work you saw that with your own eyes
right
did you all see that
i just picked it up and shook it
and scared it and it started it started
giving me information
anyway
if you'd like your day to be great all
you need is like a couple of my girl i
said thank you jealous just died i can't
teach a flask of vessel of any kind
philosophy litigant i like coffee you
join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day i
think it makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous
now go
now everything's better
apparently i was a little under
caffeinated
problem solved
well let's talk about all of the uh
things
mostly fake news today
uh pete davidson who as you know is
dating kim kardashian
much to the
displeasure of kanye
and kanye has now mocked pete davidson
to the point where pete davison
got a
tattoo i guess he got some tattoos with
kim kardashian's name on him
but also he branded her name on his skin
he branded
he actually
branded himself
with her name
now
i'm not sure that
this was kanye's plan
connie is pretty smart
i feel like kanye pushed him until he
branded himself am i wrong
if you're trying to get back at kanye
here's a way not to do it
put kanye's wife's name on your body
with a brand
and then change girlfriends probably any
day now
the fun part will be pete davidson
explaining
the brand on his body to his next
girlfriend
kanye if you're watching this
i don't know if you can stop laughing
because
i'm just going to go out on a limb and
say that kim kim kardashian is not going
to marry pete davidson
anybody want to take the other side of
that bet
i think they're not getting married
and so there's a good chance that pete
davidson is going to be making love to
his future love
and she's going to say you know what
bothers me
you didn't get my my name branded on you
and pete davidson will now have to brand
every woman he wants to uh have a
relationship with he's going to have to
get a brand on him
he's going to look like a
a cow they used to practice branding
now
i wonder what kind of a sex cult he's in
because if there's one thing that the
news has taught us
if somebody voluntarily gets a brand
they are in a sex cult
am i right so i think that kim
kardashian should probably go to jail
for many years just like the
the founder of uh nexium
who who had his little sub group there
who who branded each other
same thing must be a sex cult i think
kim kardashian probably needs to go to
jail for many years for running a sex
cult
and
convincing pete davidson to put her
brand on oh oh wait
pete davidson is male
am i right
he's male
so if a man
decides to voluntarily brand himself
that's not coercion
do you know why
because he's a man
he's a man but if a woman gets a brand
voluntarily
she's a member of a cult she couldn't
possibly have had any free will and
she's been forced to do this against her
will
why
because she's a woman
the logic is inescapable
men have free will and women don't
according to everything that i've been
told in the last few years
am i right
a woman gets a brand she must be in a
cult man gets a brand oh he just wanted
to get a brand
it's pretty sexist
pretty sexist
all right
here's some more fake news
there's a woman who is going to be uh
opening with steely dan or opening four
steely dan this summer
named amy
mann and she believes she was dropped
from the uh the show
because she's a woman
and she believes without evidence
that steely dan thought their audience
wouldn't like a female singer songwriter
to which i say
what
what
now it would be one thing if somebody
actually said that
but
nobody actually said that
do you think that in the year 2022
the steely dan
or anybody would say you know
i don't think an audience is going to
watch a woman sing
that would be crazy
no the simulation has given us another
uh
another uh entertainment here
and there her name
is amy mann
she's actually aiming to be a man
according to her name
but she was dropped because she thinks
it's because she was a female
singer-songwriter
no
that looks like
fake news
um
just to stir things up did you see that
dave rubin and his
partner's slash husband i'm not sure
what the proper terms are
are having two babies
two babies both with surrogates
different surrogates and i think
i think different
sperm and egg
i think they
i'm just guessing if you could have two
babies at about the same time
you'd probably have one baby from one
father and the other from the other four
i just assume i don't know if that's the
case
but
um
this is really pushing the science
uh each throwing sperm and oh same the
same egg donor really same egg donor
somebody said
interesting okay
well i saw some conservatives uh
vomiting in their mouth when they saw
this news and saying
dave reuben how can you call yourself a
conservative
do you know how dave rubin could call
himself a conservative he doesn't
he says he's a liberal every time
anybody asks every time
every time
a hundred percent of the time he says
he's a liberal
and then he acts like a liberal and
people say how can you call yourself a
conservative
no that didn't happen
but apparently people believe that uh
dave rubin and his husband are
violating some kind of christianity
biblical rule
to which i say
uh let me check my bible
for the part about
surrogacy
science and testing babies
uh then god said about that
well it doesn't seem to be here
it seems that the bible was silent on
surrogacy
so how do we know what the bible wanted
or what god wanted isn't that
a human interpretation
i mean i realize the bible has to be
interpreted
but
if god didn't say anything about it
whatsoever
how do you know what he's thinking
i mean it's bad enough when we're
who's giving me the snore over here you
actually pay for a subscription and then
yell snore at me
about we get rid of you
jesus
so we will get rid of you oh god my
interface doesn't let me do that all
right i guess you'll just have to say
the same word over and over again
um yeah
okay so
dave rubin's uh
making things interesting again
how about that florida law that i've
been refusing to talk about for really
good reasons
so here's the florida law
about teaching
gender orientation stuff in uh school
and
it says this is the actual
the actual language in the law that
before grade three no sexual orientation
lessons that are not age appropriate
or developmentally appropriate
can be taught
to which i say this is the most
law i've ever seen in my life
what a law
forget about
conservative liberal forget about
gender forget about everything who the
 wants a law that says that the
lesson has to be appropriate
who gets to decide what's appropriate
don't make laws about something being
age appropriate
that's not a standard
you can't make a standard
you can't make a standard that's
subjective
really we just lost the sound
did we lose the sound
no i think we're okay
oh somebody's playing a prank it's a
pretty good one all right
that's a pretty good prank all right um
so here's what i say
um
forget about what you think about
teaching children you can't make a law
like this
you can't make a law like this
right you can't make a law that says
something has to be age appropriate or
developmentally appropriate without any
standard for who decides what that is
approve and i would imagine it'd be
different for different people
right
imagine if you were a kid and you grew
up in a household
where
you know something non-traditional was
going on
maybe you should see it sooner
because it would be relevant to your
actual life so i
i just have a real problem with the law
that's just
this vague you just can't have vague
laws i mean maybe you do need some kind
of law but not this one so i would vote
against this based on vagueness and then
having nothing to do with the issue
itself
all right
china says its covent cases are reducing
i'm going to call that fake news
what do you think
do you think china is
experiencing a reduction
in cases
of omicron
how
do you think they're lockdowns or is
that good
what's this
does not look like a troll well
trolling makes you a troll
um
so i guess the
mainstream media has decided that
calling our
inflation a putin price hike
is good branding and even chuck todd
said that
and andrea mitchell agreed that putin's
price hike was a great way to message
the issue
what do you think about that
do you think it's a putin price hike
it's actually pretty good persuasion
i mean it's only persuading one side but
that's usually all anybody does anymore
so if if democrats believe it
and it looks like they do because the
democrats are not terribly good at
economics
um that it works
so as a
as persuasion it probably works probably
pretty good i gotta say if i'm just
being objective about his technique it's
probably pretty good now it's not true
of course that's a separate question
so there was an energy independence bill
that was blocked in a related story so
the house democrats
blocked a bill that was aimed at saying
we wouldn't buy any russian oil and we
would become energy independent
and the house democrats blocked it
so they're calling the
price hike a putin price hike
while they're blocking
uh independent uh drilling and energy in
this country
or at least the expansion of it
so now the democrat messaging if i
pulling these two together this is what
the democrats are telling the country
collectively
right
they're saying that putin is the main
cause of higher energy prices
would you agree that's what biden's
saying and the mainstream media are
repeating it
so they're buying into putin is the main
cause of higher energy prices
at the same time the democrats are
saying that we shouldn't and we should
not increase our domestic energy
production
do you know why
apparently it's because russian fossil
fuels do not contribute to climate
change
but american ones do
now i'm reading that into it it's the
only thing that you could conclude
because
you're going to use the same amount of
energy no matter where you buy it from
right
so if you buy it from russia we have
problems
if you buy it from the united states we
have fewer problems
but in both cases the climate change
is exactly the same
so the democrats don't even have a
message that makes sense on paper
you couldn't even write down their
message
if you wrote it down you say well
did you leave out a word or something
like it wouldn't even make sense if you
looked at it that the problem is putin's
energy hike but we don't want to
develop more energy ourselves because of
climate change even though we know it
doesn't have any effect on climate
change because we'll just buy the other
energy
am i wrong
i i need a fact check on this because to
me
it looks obvious that they're saying two
opposite things or two things that are
incompatible anyway right
that's what i'm saying
um i mean it seems so obvious that i
wondered if i was seeing it wrong
like
my head was just shaking i was like am i
looking at this right
um and i wonder how do democrats ever
win another election and of course i
asked that on twitter and everybody said
they'll rigged that election
maybe they will well jesse smullet was
ordered released from jail after serving
less than a week of a five-month
sentence
why because he's pending appeal
and i guess it's not that uncommon to
let people out when you're pending
appeal
is that true
is he being treated special the way the
news on the right
is treating it is that he's being
treated special
but i'm not sure that it is special
anymore because these days everybody's
getting out on bail right
and if you're awaiting an appeal you can
be out on bail if it's a non-violent
crime
now as many of you are correctly noting
the january 6 people did not seem to get
that
consideration
but i'm no lawyer
but i'll bet there is something
different about the january 6th
situation
isn't there
because if there's if there's not
anything different
well then i do have a problem with it
now there could be different
jurisdictions it could be just that
do you think it's just race
i don't know
it looks more like connections
but i guess here's here's the general
question
if we didn't look at the january 6
people and that does look like a
political hit
if you didn't count the january 6 which
is a special case
is it unusual that somebody with
smallett's
you know crime which stands alone i
don't think he has a criminal record it
wasn't violent
why not i'm not sure i have a problem
with having him having bail do you
isn't he exactly the guy who gets mail
because they're not saying that he's out
of jail they're just saying it's pending
the appeal if the appeal doesn't work he
goes back to jail
i would think that that would be a
standard for everybody
isn't it
does anybody know is there are there
lawyers here i feel like the standard
would be the first first ever crime
non-violent unlikely to be repeated it's
it's not exactly the kind of crime you
do twice
it's not like if you were a burglar you
might do it again or
you you're violent you might do it again
who who's going to run
another you know mega hoax
right it's not really a crime you're
going to do again
so i would think in that case you would
get bail
i'm completely in favor of him getting
bail
i'm not in favor
of the january 6 people being held
but i don't have a problem with him
getting bail that to me that seems like
exactly the case you should get bail
you know i'm not minimizing the crime he
still goes back to jail if his appeal
fails
all right
the chris cuomo thing with cnn is really
interesting
when you watched uh back when chris
cuomo was still employed at cnn and you
would watch the handoffs and the chatter
between don lemon and chris cuomo if you
could stand it
did that ever look real to you
to me that looked so amazingly fake the
whole time it was happening
i never bought that they were really
friends
it looked like it was for the camera
that's what it looked like now i think
they did hang out they probably did hang
out personally but i just never really
i didn't feel the chemistry did you
and it's not you know has nothing to do
with black or white i just didn't feel
any chemistry between those two people
i don't know
but uh chris cuomo was asking for 125
million dollars and his argument is
that you can't violate a standard that
doesn't exist
meaning cnn didn't have a standard
or if they did everybody was violating
it routinely including the boss
because apparently the
the allegation is that zucker himself
and go lust i guess that would be
zucker's girlfriend this time if i got
that right
was that the one he admitted having i
don't want to get that wrong
had also advised governor cuomo
they'd also
uh zucker had also encouraged him to
interview his brother
here's here's my thing
if if your uh
if your conflict of interest
is overt
and everybody can see it
i don't have a problem with it
do you
well i i've always been offended by the
notion that somebody would not let a
brother
give advice to a brother
because one of the brothers had a news
job i'm not buying that at all
your job doesn't override your family
connection
ever
and so there's really
yeah there's no reason that that should
have been a problem
now
given the fact that
cuomo overtly you know joked with his
brother on tv is there anybody who would
watch that
and not know that it was a biased
brother and brother interview i mean i i
feel like
we're sophisticated enough to know
people don't throw their brother under
the bus on live tv
that doesn't happen
so 25 somebody said
so i'm actually weirdly on chris cuomo's
side on this
because i think he makes a case that the
standard was not recognized
and whatever whatever his alleged
indiscretions were about
advising his brother
it definitely was not outside the norm
for the business
does anybody disagree with that
given what you saw
and given that it was all overt i mean
you knew what chris cuomo's job was you
knew what his brother's job was you knew
that they talked to each other in public
of course they talked in private of
course
like
i don't know
to me this is a non-story and i think
chris cuomo has a pretty good argument
here
he gives the example of don lemon being
friends with jesse smallett of course i
mean that had to be a source of bias
um and there are some other examples etc
yeah i'm going to go with chris cuomo on
this
did you hear about the mariopol theater
that was bombed in ukraine
and there were allegedly many civilians
hiding inside from the bombs
uh i'm going to call that fake news how
many of you believe
that the mary apollo theater in ukraine
was bombed causing hundreds of deaths
some believe it
uh i believe it was bombed i believe
there were deaths
i don't believe there were that many
people or that many deaths
because we're not seeing pictures
right
wouldn't we see pictures of just
piles of bodies now i know it's in
rubble
but still you'd see a lot more pictures
nobody said hundreds there were hundreds
of people inside
and they were talking about maybe
they're survivors so i'm guessing that
there were hundreds hundreds of alleged
deaths
well i'm just going to say that there
may have been a
horrible thing that happened
i'm not going to doubt that
my guess though is that this has been
propagandized
beyond whatever the original bad
behavior was
so i don't believe anything about the
mary pole theater except that maybe
somebody died um
i think ukraine is winning the war
as i've been saying
and i think they actually will win it i
think they're going to win it outright
they're just going to win the war
and we're seeing small signs of that now
here's the setup
if i told you in advance this is the
competition you've got on one side
you've got ukrainian patriots apparently
well trained
uh you've got
they're using american slash nato
weaponry so the best weapons
they've got the home field advantage
and their enemy is being put on
crippling economic sanctions
right so that's what they got going for
them but the russians of course have you
know tons of bombs that they can deliver
from a distance but they also have
russian conscripts
russian equipment
they're playing you know an away game on
somebody else's territory
and they have now a totally
dysfunctional economy or they will soon
who wins who wins
who wins with that setup
now
smart people say russia wins because
they can just keep bombing until they
win
they just have to want to right
basically they just have to want to win
but
do you think that putin's
putin could survive
if he just levels ukraine
i don't think so
so if you think he can do it physically
you're right
i agree with you from a physical
logistics perspective he could level
ukraine
but i don't think he can do it and win
and that's the point right
winning is the point
so i don't think that path is available
while yes it's technically true he could
do it it's not really an available path
because it goes directly to failure and
the whole point is to win
uh your facts and basic premise are
wrong
perhaps
gentlemen yelling at me in all capital
letters
could uh quickly mention some of the
assumptions that i have wrong
use your words
use your words
gelman amnesia
use your words
all capital letters and vague statements
don't mean anything but i am listening
i'm watching
so if you give me give me an assumption
that i got wrong i will take that
listen okay now you just it's just a
troll
listen to other sources
in all caps
all right we'll put user in timeout
time out
russian sources
all right so here are some of the things
which we're hearing of which uh i don't
think any of them are necessarily true
uh allegedly there was a two-day battle
in a ukrainian city called the
voznessenk
in which the ukrainians actually just
defeated the russian invaders outright
they just killed tons of them
and repelled them
and the other 100 bodies and stuff so do
you believe that do you believe that the
russian but uh military and the ukraine
military
head-to-head and the ukrainian military
just spanked them hard
i believe it could be true
meaning that any given any given group
of russian military might be stronger or
weaker
and any given group of ukrainian
defenders might be stronger or weaker so
it could be a case of the strongest
ukrainian
fighters with a weak
you know bad strategy
russian
advance
i can say it it could be true it could
be true but i wouldn't automatically
think it's true
all right there's another story again
from
three independent sources
uh what is the credibility of three
independent sources that are not named
none
all right so i'm gonna give you a story
that has no credibility whatsoever
just something i saw from a uh a uh
let's say a uh
a source on twitter
that uh one of the generals has been you
know detained for reasons unknown by the
security service so this would be yet
another example of somebody detained by
the
intelligence services
i'm not sure if i believe this story
because you can't really verify it can
you and isn't it
isn't this
is this one of those stories
that is exactly what the ukrainians
would want you to believe
uh
i'm being accused of making vague
statements
so that i can't be wrong
i don't know i think i make pretty
pretty specific statements
ukraine will win
that vague
and they will win because they have
better weapons
so i gave you a reason and a specific
outcome
yeah i think i do both but the ones you
should pay attention to are the specific
ones i would agree with that
well over in uh great britain there's a
klepto
kleptocracy unit
there that they think putin has millions
of pounds of personal wealth stashed in
london and they're going to try to
figure out where it is and
capture it i guess
so now putin's wealth that he has
presumably stashed in places around the
world
i assume he's diversified where he put
it but the countries may start looking
for it maybe they will find it
i don't know i i would guess he's pretty
good at hiding it's probably in bitcoin
by now
all right um
so i don't believe any of that stuff
so the united states
agreed to give a bunch of drones to
ukraine but the number is unspecified so
we're giving them an unspecified number
of u.s made drones now we're give them
both the big drones
that can carry
munitions and then come back to base but
apparently we're also looking at giving
them these little switchblade drones
which are smaller drones that can hover
over an area for 30 minutes
and then when it finds something that
wants to kill it it just does a suicide
dive and
kills it yeah switchblade is the name of
the drones
and
i don't know how many of those we can
make
but couldn't they win the whole war with
those
i think
somebody says you're falling for the
fake news now what's the fake news
because i don't know the numbers
and i and i'm guessing that uh
oh if you're saying i'm falling for the
fake news because i think they'll win
that's not that's not what i'm based in
now
so i'm not basing my opinion that
they'll win on the fake news
i read it to you because
it's what's happening but my opinion is
based on
logic not the news
and the logic is that our weapons are
going to be really good we haven't seen
them used by trained people in a
situation like this
and i thought if you give them enough
enough anti-tank anti-aircraft
enough drones
that ukraine wins
so it's really just
the one with the better hardware wins
and the home court advantage basically
how much training do you need for drones
and what is the range well even the
small switchblades have a several mile
range so you can be pretty far away from
your target
and i don't think it takes a ton of
training
because all they have to do is fly it
and then aim it
they can't it can't be that much at
least for the little ones the big ones
would be more of course
i assume
all right um
i'm not so sure that we need to give
airplanes to ukraine
i mean i'm not against it
but i think that if we could give them
uh buku
drones they'd be better off
or at least as well off
so if we can give them uh unlimited
drones without triggering world war iii
i'm not sure there's a reason to give
them planes
yeah
all right um
here's uh
here's how to make a hoax
if you're going to play a hoax on
somebody
you want to start with something they
already think is true
and then you add some details to it and
they're going to believe the details
because you're you're grafting it on top
of something that
you're primed to believe
so this is what putin is doing he's
using that technique it's something
we're primed to believe
but probably isn't true so he's saying
that uh
putin has claimed that the u.s has a
network of secret bio warfare labs in
ukraine
dedicated to weaponizing pathogens and
coronaviruses
now to me it seems unlikely that's true
but it's a really good persuasion play
because he knows that american public
is primed to believe that we have
weaponized virus labs all over in bad
places
so it's really good technique
if you just come up with something that
wasn't already connected to a belief
you just say ah that's not true but when
you connect it to something you already
thought was true
then it just brings it brings a whole
weight to it so that's really good
technique
um biden has called putin a war criminal
also good technique
because if you call somebody a war
criminal what does that say about the
future
because that's what it's about it's not
really about the past even though that's
the the war crimes with the past and
probably some more in the future
but it's about making sure that he's
dead as a leader
when when the president of the united
states says that the president of russia
is a war criminal
he says it clearly and wants to make
sure you've heard it clearly which is
what biden did
he's saying we'll never work with him
again
that's what i hear do you hear that
i think he's saying we'll never work
with you again never invite you to a g
anything
um and the rest of the world probably
won't either
i feel as though i feel as though that's
part of the decapitation strike that is
being planned on putin
is part of the move
to get his own people to take him out
basically if you just say you know we're
not going to deal with a war criminal
now could putin just as easily call
any united states president a war
criminal
probably
so all that matters is whether biden can
make it stick
and
were you already predisposed to thinking
that putin was a war criminal yes you
were so again uh biden's persuasion uses
the same technique he's telling you
something that you were already ready to
believe
he just filled in the blank for he said
yes true
uh so so i watched putin's speech again
this time with translation
and i gotta say
he looks mentally unstable to me
now i've told you that i'm gonna be
uh you can't trust me to be unbiased
about ukraine i might be
i might be trying to persuade too much
but
i always promise you that if i say this
it's always true if i tell you
i'm telling you the truth like in direct
sentence the following thing i say is my
real opinion
i'm never going to lie to you about that
right
if i just say it directly like look in
your digital eye and say i'm not lying
about this
you can trust it i don't think i've ever
told that kind of a lie my whole life
right i mean everybody's told the lie of
omission but if i tell you directly it's
true
i i don't know how to lie like that
but
in my opinion he looks mentally unstable
now it could be just the pressure of the
situation
it doesn't mean he's organically or has
a sickness of any kind
he looked
like someone who knew he lost
and when i say lost i mean
lost russia
lost his job lost his standing lost
everything
he just looks something like somebody
who's completely destroyed mentally
now
yeah he dropped his baby face that's
right he used to have this weirdly uh
incongruous
uh face that made you like him
like he always had this likable smile
about him even though presumably he's
always been a monster but he dropped the
likable smile now it could be he just
says warface on maybe but he looks puffy
and
maybe drugged
maybe drugged
there's something going on that's not
just he's 69.
i'm positive
if i had to bet on it i'd bet
whatever i'm positive i don't know what
it is
could be drugs could be
illness could be just the stress of the
situation but he's not all there
now i don't think that means he's going
to launch a nuke
i'm
you know i'm not on that worry
uh worry bandwagon
but i don't think he's functioning at
his best it wouldn't surprise me
especially since what he talked about
was the
um i think he was talking about the
oligarchs
and some who don't even live in russia
who may be moving against them a little
bit
so i think that
putin is afraid of his own oligarchs
he's
afraid of kovid
he thinks he lost the war
he might be afraid of his own generals
at this point if he's detaining them
um he's in a world of trouble
so that's my my prediction is that
ukraine will win outright and that going
on offensive and with these new weapons
i think they're going to get it done
daniel dale who does the fact checking
for cnn
uh did a fact checking fact check that
is a friendly to a conservative
i don't know how many times he's done
that
but i'll give him credit for doing it
this time
so there's a viral tweet saying that
marjorie taylor green
refused to applaud zelinski
that's false
because if you looked at the entire tape
you would see that she
she applauded him four times but one of
those times she was reaching for her
phone or something and that's the part
that they
that was the viral tweet um and daniel
dale says she was a pretty tepid clapper
but full footage shows she clapped four
times blah blah so
i found this interesting daniel dale um
gave a full-throated fact check to this
and fact check
that marjorie taylor green did not make
a mistake
interesting
so you know it's also nada she's not
running for office or anything so
um it's not the biggest
thing in the world
let's see
i believe
i've touched
all of my points
after i'm done with the live stream
today i'm going to do a little micro
lesson for the people on locals
how to improve their life
i don't know what to do next to improve
it
and i should be able to post that before
noon i think today
um
russian sub-commanders get their launch
orders directly from putin
interesting
uh do you think that a sub-commander
would launch a nuke
if that sub-commander had any
information about the outside world
do they
all right here's the question would a
sub-commander
who's actually you know in the sub
do they have access to the outside world
like the internet
would they have any idea what's going on
in the real world
in the movies they don't
they do when they surface as somebody
says
uh
yeah so i just wonder if a sub commander
would
obey that order
so somebody says yes and they were a
submariner so the submarine does know
what's happening in the outside world
all the time right yeah i can't see them
launching a nuke even if ordered
uh they do they do drills to make sure
new controllers don't worry about the
outside world they're trained and
checked interesting so you're saying
that they're trained not to use their
own judgment about the outside world
that doesn't surprise me
they get the news from russian sources
but you know before you launch a nuke i
feel like you'd probably check
major psychological testing
yeah but they're still human
i don't know
um i don't think it's zero risk but i
think it's really low
must read the substory in the cuba
crisis well i don't think the cuban
crisis has any relevance to today
because of technology
u.s does the same training
to see if they will launch when ordered
if not they're removed
eddie says you don't have time to check
you get the order and proceed to correct
depth
i don't know
i i guess i'm skeptical i hear what
you're saying i hear that they would
design the system to get rid of that
risk
but i don't know that they would
i don't know that they would
uh
um tim poole getting spotted again
why does he keep getting swatted
they haven't found anything yet why
would they swat him like five times or
something
russia subs used to need three officers
an agreement to fire somebody says
where is the nuclear football
did the crew of the enola gay question
orders
no but they also knew it was world war
ii
so i think in world war ii nobody
questioned in order to drop a bomb of
any kind
oh there was a bomb threat not a swat
he has a compound
all right
um
that
how to use your talent stack to
demonstrate to know that you are capable
of major career changes so interesting
uh all right that's all for now and i'll
talk to you on youtube tomorrow
