dude
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization the
highest achievement
that humanity is ever accomplished it's
called coffee with Scott Adams and there
is nothing better
and luckily you're here
so
good for you your day is starting off
right
and if you'd like to take it up another
level and it's possible I know seems
unlikely but it's possible all you need
is
a copper mug or a glass of tanker
Chelsea sign the canteen jogger flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamines of the day the
thing makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous Sip and it
happens now
go yeah finally on time you're finally
on time
so is it Hammer Time
foreign
true story
MC Hammer's first home
was built by the same Builder who built
the home I'm in true story
just a weird coincidence
well let's talk about all the things
funniest tweet of the day
is that Biden's poll numbers are up in
four states
does anybody understand that reference
yeah you have to watch all the news
yesterday to know how funny that is
Biden's poll numbers are up in four
states Biden said in public uh that
there are 54 states
now the joke's on you you thought he
misspoke right
you thought he didn't know the number of
states and he misspoke
no
this is the Democrat plan they're going
to try to get four extra States
recognized before the midterms it's
their only chance
they've got a few days to do it we'll
get DC in there and maybe Guam
I don't know a few other things
maybe some Indian Reservations whatever
it takes
whatever it takes we'll get to 54 by the
midterms no not really
um
[Laughter]
I have to give you some background
to the story first
there's a bad element of my personality
which I confess I'm not proud of
I'm not proud of this at all it's just
true
when I hear a story about a
a serial killer who built an underground
torture chamber that his neighbors
didn't know about for decades
I say to myself well it's terrible that
he did these crimes I feel bad for the
victims
but it's also true
that is one industrious serial killer
and part of me is thinking wow
there's a person who had a plan and
executed a plan executed more than that
as it turns out
but I always think you know you got to
look at the positive part
there there's somebody who had a system
put it together was dedicated made it
work well I take that story and move to
this story which is there's a homeless
man in Los Angeles
who is tired of the city asking him to
move or take down his tent
so he built a wooden structure
on wheels
sorry so he put He built basically a
wooden tent it's not a tent it's like a
little house so basically he built his
own Adu you know that's a means
additional dwelling units or something
like that uh like people put in their
backyard to put the Mother-in-law in so
he built one apparently he's even got
electric he's got electric generator I
think he might have running water in
there but the funniest part is that it's
on Wheels so if they tell them to move
he just picks up his house and he pushes
it down the sidewalk
oh
I'm thinking to myself
this is not the worst idea right
so imagine if you will
that we had a a place that all the
homeless could go where they would be
left alone to do what they want drugs
live on the street do whatever they want
but you also gave them
um let's say some instructions on how to
build their own little structures
it might be a it might be a fun
experiment that's good for them and good
for us just see what they could come up
with
I mean what would happen if you let the
homeless build the world
that they want to live in
see the trouble is that you know the the
non-homeless have built this world
and then the homeless don't want to live
in it
so
maybe give them just a little bit of
help
to build the world they want to live in
and maybe they could do a good job I
don't know this guy seems pretty happy
with his little mobile sidewalk home
there's something like amazingly human
and inspirational about this as weird as
it is
all right we have to talk about Paul
Pelosi
when was the last time
a story was exactly what it looked like
you know you hear a story and you go
well that's the story
and then a year later that's still the
story
it feels like that never happens now
right if politics are involved
especially
so here are the here are the weird
things we know about this story there's
so many weird things about this
so you know that the police came when
Pelosi was under in his underwear and
the breaker inner guy was in his
underwear and they were wrestling over a
hammer police said put down that hammer
and Pelosi did but the other guy didn't
and the other guy beat him with a hammer
so here's the new stuff that I'm finding
out today and when I say I'm finding out
that just means I'm a little slow on it
number one apparently there was at least
one more person in the house
but we don't know anything about that
person because somebody answered the
door for the police and it wasn't those
two people
now I heard that normally the house
would be staffed
so I'm guessing it was a staff member
who was asleep until that point
maybe a staff member who just didn't
know what was happening and until it was
sort of too late or something I don't
know
the next question I'd ask is was the
staff member in his or her underwear
I just want to know if everybody goes to
the house just wears underwear
I mean you can't rule that out I only
know two people who've ever been
described to be in the house and both of
them were in their underpants
if a third person was also known to be
in the house
should we follow the pattern let's say
first one was an Underpants second was
an Underpants third one well I don't
know maybe Underpants possibly I'm not
ruling it out there's no evidence of
that fact
then then the other funny thing was and
I didn't know this yesterday I think I
saw I saw cernovich tweet about it but I
didn't connect it to the story
so sirovich was on it right away the
broken glass
for the window that allegedly was the
access point for the homeless guy the
broken glass was on the outside of the
hole
that's that's not how that works
if you break glass it goes in toward the
toward the hammer Direction
or if it was a hammer
but if you were having any kind of an
altercation inside the house you could
imagine something getting broken and
landing outside the house
so we don't know about anything about
that broken glass that's something
now Hillary of course wanted to
immediately get on in the on the action
and before we knew much about the story
when people were saying this homeless
guy was radicalized by Maga
Hillary gets in on it and she tweets
that the Republican party and his
mouthpieces now regularly spread hate
and deranged conspiracy theories it is
shocking but not surprising that
violence is a result as Citizens we must
hold them accountable for their words
and the actions that follow we must hold
them accountable
we must hunt them down she didn't say
that but I read between the lines gotta
hunt those Republicans for doing this
bad stuff now
uh here are stories I've heard this
morning but I can't put any credibility
on them
I'll just tell you this is what's going
around
the stories that he was Maga are based
on social media or website postings
right
those appear to have been created when
he got caught in other words they were
fake
so do we have a confirmation that his
postings about Maga were fake or were
some of them real but there were also
some fakes
we don't know right
so some people are saying he's Maga but
apparently he also was a black lives
matter where he lived with a black lives
matter supporter
who sported uh lgbtq
and he was a a Berkeley uh nudist
hemp hemp making nudist
so a hundred percent of the the way the
guy lived
suggests he was a Democrat or leading
left right A hundred percent of the way
he lived but there's this sketchy
website social posting thing
that some people are saying was fake and
I don't know
I don't know or not now if we had not
heard from Michael schellenberger about
how this guy really lived
I don't think the news was going to
cover it
watch how many times you get your news
from just somebody on Twitter
he's not just somebody but you know
people who are on Twitter who are not
part of a news organization are telling
us more than the news that's like a real
thing that's happening now
um
so what else is funny about this let's
see
um then Elon Musk responded to Hillary
Clinton's uh tweet
and and Elon I'm paraphrasing but he
said there's a small chance there's more
to the story
and then he tweets a story that was so
fake news about you know some gay bar
kind of a thing uh it was so fake news I
think it was already taken down nine
minutes after he tweeted it I couldn't
even read it because it was taken down
so fast
now
if they had of Tweeter had a Twitter
tweet something that
looks very sketchy he would have known
it looks sketchy but he said there's a
small chance
if somebody says there's a small chance
are they signaling that it's a low
credibility was he just having fun with
it
did he believe it might be possible that
her husband was gay
uh and you know or the Pelosi's husband
was gay was he just putting it out there
we don't know what Elon Musk was
thinking
but I saw
um I saw some pushback that it was
deeply irresponsible
for her to for
for Elon Musk to tweet and obviously in
some people's opinion obviously untrue
source
what do you think
do you think it was uh
do you think it was irresponsible to
tweet and obviously untrue source
well
you'd have to the first thing you'd have
to ask yourself is who was he replying
to and what was he replying to
what he was replying to was an obviously
untrue tweet
Hillary Clinton was making a statement a
fact about this guy being a Maggie guy
and that is definitely not proven it
might be proven you know later it might
be proven but at the time that Hillary
was tweeting it
it was closer to
I mean she was just making a stand so
that that would be in your head whether
it was proven true or not true in the
long term
what Elon did was tweeze some
to match her and when I saw
that was like oh good
some to match the that
feels like a step forward
because here's why it's a step forward
because probably the left actually sees
Elon musk's tweets
but they don't see anybody else's tweets
so he's he's one of the few people who
can actually
call on the left and the left
will actually even see the tweet
right
so calling I'm Hillary Clinton
was fun
the fact that he used some to
call
is double fun in my in my opinion
because if there's anything we know he's
not taking this too seriously
yeah he's taking the business seriously
but he's not taking himself seriously
we know that because he already he
tweeted a dick joke already I don't know
if you missed it but you have to check
his feet every day though
you literally tweeted a dick joke with
no no political purpose whatsoever it
was just a dick joke that's it
now if you tell me I could be happier
knowing that the new owner of Twitter is
using Twitter to tweet dick jokes
there's nothing that would make me
happier
no nothing
you you could try to make me happier
today but good luck that would be hard
to top yeah
so that's awesome
um here's the next awesome thing
you know what uh bugs me a lot in life
probably bugs you too it's a thing
called terms of service
you know how companies have terms of
service and her I hate it when this
company makes me
uh have to bow down to their terms of
service don't you hate at that don't
don't you wish
there's some way you could flip it
around
don't you wish
that the company
would have to bow down to your terms of
service
but impossible right
because you know unfortunate that's like
a crazy thing that could never happen in
the real world there'd never be a
company that would bow down to your
terms of service
interestingly
do you know what the terms of service
are for Tesla employees
Elon musk's rule at Tesla if he didn't
know this is that they're specifically
instructed I'm not making this up
Tesla employees employees are
specifically instructed to not do
something that could show up in a
Dilbert comic
that's like a real thing
it's in writing
now suppose the person who came up with
that terms of service Elon Musk suppose
he took that to his next company
I mean why wouldn't he I mean it's still
the rule of Tesla
so is there any reason he wouldn't bring
it to Twitter
if he does
if he does which is a reasonable
assumption right it's a reasonable
assumption if he does
Twitter employees
will be living under my terms of service
thank you
thank you
thank you
foreign
perfect or what
am I right
that remember Elon Elon has told he
himself that reality tends to move in
the direction of greatest entertainment
value
is this not the greatest entertainment
value that Twitter might be under the
Twitter employees might be under my
terms of service
that's that's like a real thing
how much more perfect could that be well
not couldn't be more perfect
um and here's here's more to why I think
that so the other thing that Elon
tweeted today is he got an automatic
message which I assume you get when
you're a new manager at Twitter
and the message was that he needs to
sign up for Twitter's management
management 101 Workshop
so Elon tweeted he thought it was funny
that he was being asked to sign up for a
Twitter 101 Workshop management 101 but
then then he tweeted you know that
management 201 is such a tantalizing
carrot hahaha
and I thought I want to name my band
tantalizing carrot
now when I tell you that he's good at
this
is sort of a trump tell
and the tell is can you ever come up
with a phrase like tantalizing carrot
then just by itself
is just so fresh and I don't know you
just want to say it don't you
so this is what Trump does when Trump
says
uh you know crooked Hillary or whatever
you just want to say it
it comes out of his mouth and then you
want to repeat it but when I heard
tantalizing carrot
tantalize a carrot that must be my new
band name
all right
um I saw LeBron was concerned because
there are reports that the n-word
usage is up 500 percent on Twitter since
Elon Musk took over
now let me ask you I have seen zero
occurrences and I spend a lot of time
with some rough customers on Twitter
right if your content leans right and
anyway you see some rough customers
I haven't seen that word
have you
has anybody even seen it once
since Elon Musk took over I haven't
right
right now don't you think that the
algorithm is suppressing it and you know
probably should
I wouldn't have a big I wouldn't have a
big complaint about that would you
I mean some people may say Free Speech
Free Speech but you know hay speech is
not exactly free speech
you know there there is a line you know
if the algorithm blocked or suppressed
anything that had that word in it
that that would be an exception to free
speech which is let me say this
if it were uh overt I'd be fine with it
I'd be less fine with it if I didn't
know what was happening
see what I'm saying
I mean is Twitter said we're just gonna
we're just gonna suppress that word use
it all you want but it's just going to
show up on your own feed we're not going
to show it to other people
I'd be fine with that as long as I knew
that's what they were doing and why then
I could choose to be in the system you
know people could say I don't want to be
in a system they can't use that word
well okay it's a free market yeah go
nuts
now if you extended that
you know be careful how you extend it
you might extend it to other known
obvious hate words but you know I
wouldn't go much further
all right
um so when I did a little Twitter poll I
asked how many people had seen this
n-word or even an uptick in Badness is
the way I said it only six percent of
the people who follow me
say they've seen an uptick in any
Badness recently that is much worse
what
all right
[Applause]
um
the the other news about Twitter Twitter
is just so interesting this week
is that the uh the the executives that
musk fired right away including the CEO
agrawal the report is that musk fired
them as opposed to
retiring them or something that would
allow them their large severances so the
early report was that they would get
these huge multi-million dollar
severances but then today's report and
neither of these are credible right so
so far we don't have any confirmation of
any of this but today's report is that
because they were fired for cause
meaning that bad performance that Elon
Musk would not have to pay that because
it was not because of the Takeover it
was for a Cause
I don't know
I don't know
I mean I don't think uh any of them are
getting that poor but do you think it
would be reasonable that the CEO of
Twitter could be fired for cause
I would say yeah if anybody had the
cause to be fired it would be that guy
at least you know if you're the new
owner I certainly would I would have
fired him for a Cause
right wouldn't you
I mean you wouldn't have lasted a minute
if I if I bought the company
and I'm not sure any CEO would have
right you don't really want to have a
co-ceo or anything
yeah I mean if you have a if you have an
ugly takeover like that you just have to
clean out the the negative negativity as
soon as you can
so I think that's going the way it
should have
um
so the New York Times is reporting that
Ukraine has a distinct artillery
advantage over Russia now
did you expect to hear that
didn't didn't we hear from the very
beginning well sure Ukraine is Plucky
and they've got some advantages and sure
they got starlink and they've got you
know better morale for fighting and
they've got you know some Western stuff
but didn't we didn't we always believe
that the artillery Advantage was just
clearly Russia
no doubt about it right
now Russia still has the numerical
Advantage by I don't know 100 to one so
it's a gigantic military advantage in
numbers artillery numbers but apparently
the U.S has provided or the West has
provided enough of the accurate stuff
including some drones
that Ukraine is actually doing more
damage to Russia than Russia is doing to
Ukraine
do you believe that
now remember
I give you my I give you my
my disclaimer for all news about Ukraine
all news about Ukraine should be
considered low credibility
doesn't matter if it comes out of my
mouth or anybody else's right that's our
deal our deal is the only way we can
talk about it is if we all agree that
every fact that we allege is low
credibility
as long as you'll give me that freedom
then we can talk about it have some fun
so there are two there are two
narratives out there
competing
one is that Russia will you know freeze
and starve Ukraine take as long as they
want uh they have such an advantage that
eventually they'll just grind him down
and take over and there's nothing you
can do in the long run
that's one narrative
the other narrative is that Ukraine has
such a better morale
and better Weaponry that the Russians
ultimately are going to get you know
beaten back and their morale will
collapse and things will go very bad
do you think that we could really tell
which of those is true
do you think from our position today
you could tell me that Russia won't
mount a massive counter-attack that that
works could you tell me that can't
happen
I mean not that against it but I
wouldn't tell you it can't happen
uh are you idiot Jesus Shanika
why the are you on here could you
listen to one thing I say before
commenting listen to this Scott
uh we just don't get why you always
believe Pro Ukrainian news oh why do I
always believe pro-ukrainian news you
 idiot
how many times do I have to tell you I
don't believe it
don't believe it
you shouldn't believe it I don't believe
it you shouldn't believe it
 idiot Jesus Christ
um
seriously like it's so frustrating to
live with people who are such
idiots in the world
isn't it
it's like you try to have any
conversation about anything and there's
always one idiot have you
noticed that if you work with like five
people in your day job
one of them is always a
always have you noticed that
and here's the weird part
if that person leaves
they're always replaced with another
 aren't they
just like a different one because
there's no such thing as five people
without one
and if you tell yourself Scott that's
not true I'm in a group of five people
and there are no in my
group
you're the
I hate to tell you
because it's like a universal rule of
five people one's going to be bad
uh so shalique was the bad one there
anyway so no we don't believe anything
that comes out of Ukraine
um
uh let's see so Russia is a reportedly
going to suspend its deal about grain so
that they can put pressure on Ukraine
to to
starve people so it does look like
Russia's strategy is to starve and
freeze anybody they can
to get some some kind of advantage
uh do you think that'll work
and why isn't that a war crime
at what point does start targeting the
population centers turn into a war crime
are you telling me that it's
it's completely militarily valid to
knock out the power before the winter
for uh
for a civilian population
you know I I get why it would be a war
crime to like you know round up people
and just shoot them
but why is it not a war crime to cut off
their uh utilities so they die
is it because it's lower
so that's okay because it's slower
yeah no I realize Siege Warfare has been
you know let's say standard Warfare
forever
but it's still a war crime isn't it
is it not like it's a weird place to
draw the line
I I've always I've always been curious
about how we uh
how we avoid using our best weapons in a
war
like how we actually get away with not
using nuclear and
um and chemical weapons I'm glad we
don't of course
but it's weird that
that war has rules
isn't it
how weird their War has rules
uh and that we and the people obey them
now I get that if they feel like if they
don't then everybody will turn against
them blah blah blah
but still I'm surprised it's not how you
expect people to act
all right um
here's my call for uh fake news I'm
going to call some fake news
have you seen the reports about The
Plucky Ukrainian citizens who have
started their own drone making little
factories and they're taking the smaller
hobbyist drones and they're weaponizing
them
and uh and the news is reporting that it
might be changing the tide of the war
okay Bob you sucking idiot
who says that's a bit naive Scott Bob
wait a second will you wait a
 second the context of this is I
told you it's fake news
so if I say I'm gonna tell you something
that's fake news and that I
describe it and you say I'm gullible for
believing it how about listening to the
 fake news part about it before
you comment
idiot
sorry I'm just having fun with them
um so yes my call is that all those
stories are fake news to hide the
following speculated possibility
all right I'm just speculating this I'm
speculating that the ukrainians have
such good drones from the United States
like the really good stuff
and maybe some of them are small too
that they have to cover for the fact
that they have advanced Weaponry from
the U.S and the way they cover it is by
showing this of story of these
Plucky ukrainians who are making their
own drones that are changing the course
of the war
does does this seem to you
that the people in the little factory
making their own hobbyist drones are
they the ones changing the course of the
war
I don't think so now I believe they
probably exist I believe they probably
are making their little drones that try
to drop a hand grenade or something and
it probably makes a difference a little
one
it feels like a cover story doesn't it
who's with me that it feels like a cover
story don't know
if I if I said I knew that would be
going too far but doesn't it feel
exactly like a cover story
right once I tell you you see it right
you probably didn't see it until I
mentioned it but as soon as I mentioned
it you go oh God obviously these little
hobby drones are not making a difference
obviously it's a cover story for the the
good stuff
yeah it's a little too on the nose
somebody on YouTube says I'm dealing
with low information uh viewers you know
that is so wrong
I would argue I don't know if how you
could test this it'd be interesting if
you could
I would argue that my viewers are
probably the best informed
of just about anywhere
because I don't know anywhere else that
even tries to show you both both sides
you know if there is a bull sites do you
know any any other source that even
tries to tell you what's real
I don't know I'm not aware of one
I mean usually they're either just
having fun
or they're one-sided right you get a
little bit of Bill Mara but that's it
all right
um
I saw Andres back house uh who says lots
of provocative things lately uh and oh
let me let me give you uh some advice
and Andres if you watch this this is for
you specifically
so this is advice for Andres
people follow me and they see me
use profanity and attack people on
Twitter and generally be a you know
flaming in in public
don't be like me
right I I think Mike cernovich gave the
same advice if I remember correctly
don't be like me right so if I could
make it work
it has more to do with my specific
situation right now part of is I have Fu
money so
so I have more freedom but if I thought
I needed a paycheck someday I wouldn't
act like this in public you know that
right
I would never act the way I do if I had
to get a job
it's only because I don't need a job
that I can I can be profane and do
whatever the hell I want
but if if you're trying to get through
let's say the the early part of your
career where you really depend on other
people to
treat you right don't don't be
provocative on social media
it's not to your advantage not even a
little bit it's fun it gets you retweets
and I can see why you do it but it's
just a bad life strategy don't do it you
should delete your account get rid of
all the tweets for sure you should get
rid of all your provocative tweets for
sure
um
but what I forgot what his point was but
his point was this provocative he says
it's probably fair to assume that the
Ukrainian Army also has an IQ advantage
over the Russian military
IQ advantage
now they they might have a professional
in some cases
well all right let's let's think you
through a little bit I don't know the
answer to the question but let's think
it through
so
if you're a Ukrainian what is the
requirement for you to serve
if you're a Ukrainian the requirement
for you to be in the military is to be
male and not even male I think women are
serving as well yes but let's say stick
with the average you have to be male
within a within a certain age
what is the Russian requirement to be in
the military
I don't know exactly but it seems to me
that the ones that were in the military
probably were the ones who didn't have
options
am I right if you were to compare a
volunteer army of people who uh didn't
have any choice they're defending the
country
you end up getting don't you get the
like Benjamin Franklin and
you know you end up with George
Washington and you know you basically
you end up with the founding fathers
right I mean this is exaggeration to
make the point right but the people who
volunteer to save their own country that
they live in
are going to be the cream of the crop
am I wrong
isn't it the smart people who are
staying to fight in Ukraine
and in Russia only the dumb people are
getting into the war now again these are
wildly exaggerated because the constru
the conscription is picking up uh just
anybody that can get
but you tell me that the smartest people
in Russia are in the military can you
tell me that
seriously are the smartest people in you
in Russia in the military
now ask the same question about Ukraine
I'll bet they are
I'll bet they are I'll bet the smartest
people are in the military in Ukraine
yeah along with everybody else right but
I'll bet there is a I'll bet there is
actually a noticeable IQ difference in
the Ukraine military
and there is some report that the
American trainers of the dato trainers
were impressed with the ukrainian's
ability to you know quickly pick up the
weaponry
Etc
not the smartest man in the U.S yeah
um
the latest evidence that Ivermectin
proves science doesn't work
and what I mean by that is I'm not
saying ivermected works or doesn't work
I have no idea
what I'm saying is that the way we dealt
with our Ivermectin proved you can't
trust science anymore
would you all agree with that
it was the most Stark case of where no
matter which way it goes
no matter what we learn in the long long
run about Ivermectin that it worked or
didn't work the one thing we can agree
on is it ruins science because we can
never trust it again
that's how I feel
yeah here's like just the perfect
example and I say when I talk about
Ivermectin I'm saying the same thing I
say about Ukraine which is everything I
say about Ukraine or Ivermectin
no matter how confidently I say it
just assume that I don't know that's
true because you can't know anything
about either one of those things
but this was fun I tweeted this uh so
you knew there was this new study that
purported to be a credible study that
purported to say Ivermectin doesn't work
and then the Skeptics tore it apart and
said here are all the the problems with
it and they did look like real problems
to me I mean I'd like to hear the
Counterpoint but it looked like the
Skeptics did
a good job of tearing it apart but then
this is this is just the best part
somebody who is real good with
statistics
says that if you look at the study it
proves it does work
and that the people who did the study
don't know how to do their own
statistics
and he showed his work
he showed where in the study he was
referring to
he says if you actually knew how to do a
Bayesian whatever he said if you
actually knew how to do it right you
could take their own numbers and it
shows something like a over 90 percent
effect 90 certainty
that Ivermectin works
according to the study that says it
doesn't work
if you did their own numbers correctly
so he's just using their own numbers
right he's not adding any numbers he's
just doing the math correctly he claims
on their own data it says if you do the
math correctly it works looks like it
works fine
now
which would be unusual because the other
critics now here's where it gets
interesting the other critics were
saying that for example here's what like
one example of what's wrong with it
the people were supposed to start the
Ivermectin
within a few days of symptoms right
and if that were not true
then everything
is ridiculous
do you know how the people who started
within a few days of symptoms do you
know how they got the Ivermectin
I'm just going to wait for your head to
explode I'm just going to put this
together slowly so your head just goes
bam when I'm done
so it was a test to make sure that
people who had just got the symptoms
like really early if they took
Ivermectin to see if that made a
difference and how did they get the
actual Ivermectin
medicine
it was mailed to them
it was mailed to them through the
regular mail
I don't even know if it was priority
come on
come on that's like not even trying
right so none of the people in the study
ever saw the people who ran the study it
was all done remotely
they just mailed them and then here's
the second thing they didn't do
there was no monitoring of whether they
actually took the drug
or if they took the right amount or if
they took it at the right time
none of that so that was a study that
people were pointing to and saying proof
proof that it doesn't work
now
again if you're listening to me and
saying you know Scott is telling you it
works or it doesn't work I'm not telling
you that
I'm telling you that Ivory Ivermectin
proves science doesn't work so I'm not
going to use science to give you an
opinion when I vermect improve science
doesn't work it can't tell me if if
Ivermectin works so therefore science
doesn't work
and I don't think it's a hard question
either
you know if if you look at all the
things that science has tried to
determine
where on that list would be does
Ivermectin work against covet
that would be near the near the easiest
thing that science could do
am I wrong
what could be more easy for science
than showing whether Ivermectin which is
already developed and worked and it's in
the marketplace and we already know the
safety profile right if you already know
the safety profile and you're testing
against this one specific virus
you tell me the science can't figure
that out in two years
I mean clearly science doesn't work it's
just broken
uh
so there's that I feel like there were
some other funny stories
that I didn't get to
was there something funny that happened
today that I forgot
um
ivermected as a promising anti-cancer
drug yeah I talked about ligma and
Johnson that hoax
the slaughter meter I think I'm going to
stay away from the slaughterbeater
as I gotfeld announced his dog
well that would be a
all right well I did see it I saw a
picture of it that's the most adorable
little dog does have a name what's the
dog's name
does that have a name yet all right
well let the audience do it I guess
oh yeah what is wrong with Madonna
do you know Madonna scares me more than
most people let me tell you why
if you're not following the Madonna
thing she's had enough
um
looks like cosmetic surgery on her face
at least that she is no longer
recognizable like you you literally
wouldn't recognize her on the street she
doesn't look like Madonna even a little
bit but it doesn't look good
like it she's sort of a creature looking
thing now
now obviously that suggests that she
doesn't have anybody giving her advice
that she follows
and she's doing these cringy uh tick
tocks
that are just awful
so here's what I worry about
who in the world can tell her to stop
doing whatever she's doing
it's nobody right like literally nobody
she she's completely uncontrolled and I
was I was worrying that about myself
because you know I do seem to have some
influence on some things in the world
but what happens if I lose my mind
like who's going to stop me
seriously
like who could stop me if I decided to
go evil
I mean
you know if all I if all I were doing
was talking you know and basically
that's what Madonna's doing Madonna is
just communicating
if all I was doing is communicating
how would you know I had turned into
some like evil like mentally insecure
person
I don't know
uh so I do worry that I could be
dangerous
if if I lost my mind because it wouldn't
be anybody to stop me in time
yeah
I I wrote a book about this
called the religion War
and the religion war was published in
2003 maybe it was a sequel to God's
degree and in it it was a time in the
future in which small drones could be
carrying munitions
and
you know it sort of starts from there
the cities are unsecure cities are
unsafe because of of drone attacks
but there was a character in there
who
hired somebody to kill him if necessary
it's a part of the plot is that the main
character who had a lot of power one of
the main characters actually had a
person he hired as an assistant to kill
him
if it ever got to the point where it had
to be done
um
if I lost all my followers from being
insane you would look into the cause
well I think I would have more followers
if I were insane don't you
because it depends how insane I went if
I went full uh
you know a hammer in my Underpants and
saying then yeah I get that but suppose
I just sort of turned in some way
I don't know that's that's what I worry
about
I worry about
um I worry about having too much freedom
isn't that weird
I literally worry about having too much
freedom because there's some point where
that's going to be dangerous
yeah I don't want to go fully a
all right
um
depends on where you place the hammer
you know there's a non-zero chance that
both the Pelosi's were getting hammered
at exactly the same time
just on different coasts
God's debris should be turned into a
um
oh my God
I just figured it out
oh no
all right
here's what here's what probably has to
happen so God's debris is a small book
which features primarily two characters
talking and I always imagined that it
would be turned into either a play or a
video in which the two characters
talking
would have their what they're talking
about somewhat animated at the same time
that they're talking
so you could hear their words but you
can see it visually while they're
talking
and I thought the AI is right at the
point where you could just feed it the
feet of the script and tell it to
um to build the visual
and AI could probably come very close to
designing two characters putting them
there and then showing you what they're
thinking
uh above
yeah that's the perfect I think it needs
to be an AI an AI creation
now I'm not authorizing that yet so
there would be a copyright problem if
somebody makes it on their own but
uh I'd be real interested to see if it's
doodle I'll tell you what I will
authorize I'll authorize
a test like one chapter or something
um
yeah the power of God's degree is the
reader casts themselves in the role
that's true yeah it might it might come
across different in a different medium
that is true
all right uh
another fed hike
uh
asked the AI to throw in some free a b
testing okay
okay Rizzo
so over on uh let me uh fix the broken
egos over on YouTube
um on YouTube uh Dr Umar saying Scott's
ego is out of control lately and Frank
Rizzo is saying time and time again he
just keeps doing the same comment
time for more ego jerking cover yourself
from scouts splooge
now Frank is saying this over and over
again
so his comment about my ego he really
needs you to see it so could you all
give
Frank some attention because he seems to
be suffering some kind of a narcissistic
supply problem
so if if you could all give Frank some
attention then his weak pathetic little
ego that is destroying his life you know
maybe you could resurrect it because he
has a problem when people whose job it
is to tell you what they do tell you
what they do
Frank you realize that my whole
act
is telling you what I think is going to
happen and then comparing it to what
happened
that's all I do here
if you can't handle that you really need
to be somewhere else and just off
uh so Frank if you'd like to stay here
with your tiny little ego you you have
been promoted to mascot
you know what that means right
now you're my
so Frank
you're my new Shelly
because you're such a
that I'm going to use you as the butt of
all of my jokes of small ego tiny little
troll piss ants
all right
you know
tell me the truth
uh how much do you enjoy seeing somebody
push back at trolls
is it unpleasant because you know it's
sort of a negative energy or is it fun
because I'm just using it for
entertainment
it doesn't it doesn't stay with me right
the the moment I'm done with it I'll
never remember it again
yeah it's pure entertainment pure
entertainment
time for time for Scott's booster
how many on YouTube let's see how many
stupid people there are all right here's
a test for stupid people
stupid people how many believe that I
promoted vaccinations go
I know on the the locals platform
they're smart so I don't have to ask
that question but on YouTube how many
believe I promoted vaccinations go
stupid people show yourself
okay Gordy is stupid
and and is proud to admit it
God
Steve wanted to mention some fake news
from a long time ago because he couldn't
get anything new
so
um
really
yeah I thought that would be more stupid
people on YouTube
I'm actually a little impressed is it
because you're too shy stupid people
we're all my stupid people
you're all smart all the ones commenting
are smart
yeah interesting
all right
um too shy
Sparky says that listen to this comment
Sparky paid five dollars for this
comment Scott you're a busy man why do
you waste your time using the MSM
mainstream media as a source after
you've con after they've continually
misled you
Sparky
you're very close to mascot territory
here but you did pay save five dollars
for that comment
so I'm gonna call that a break even
uh your comment did not rise to the
level of
good
but you did pay me five dollars for it
of which I think I get
some of that so I think I made three
dollars pay taxes about 50. all right so
I'm probably a buck fifty ahead
for that comment okay more of those
Sparky I give you a pass I came out
ahead keep going keep going with that
more more of that
um has anyone checked in on Keith
olberman
has anybody actually quit
um Twitter because of Elon Musk
and Dr Umar says but Scott believes the
science on climate change
oh Dr Umar Samir
I don't know if you're real because I
can't imagine real people being such a
dumb but
let me address that
do I does Scott believe the science
what do you think do I believe the
science of climate change
those of you've been watching me do I
believe the science of climate change
I'm saying a mixture
no and yes
the answer is the answer is no and yes
right so it depends what you call the
science
I believe now I don't usually I don't
with science I usually give it a
likelihood
so the first part is that you're a dumb
idiot
and dumb idiots are the worst kind of
idiots uh you would be an idiot to think
that I say science is uh binary that's
right or wrong because I can't tell what
I usually do is say what the odds are
and so what I say about climate change
is that the basic science
has a good chance of being right very
high chance and the basic science is if
you add CO2 to the environment
it is likely to warm
all things all other things being
constant I think that's true
probably
right now if it turns out that that was
not true someday would you say Scott was
wrong
well you couldn't say that because even
if I said it was a 90 chance of being
right and then it turned out to be wrong
you couldn't even say the odds were
wrong
think about it
if I say there's a 90 chance that
something is true and then later we find
out it's not true was I wrong
that's the question for you was I wrong
if I say there's a 90 chance it's true
but then later we find that it's not
true no I was not wrong
there's no way to determine whether I
was right or wrong because I wasn't
talking about whether it was true or
false I was talking about the odds
the odds allowed it to happen or not
happen because 10 is you know healthy a
healthy odd
snow
there's no way to determine if my
estimate of the odds was wrong all we
know is what happened that's all you
know now if you did lots of you know
iterations of that I suppose you could
tell something
um
yeah Jason I'm going to agree with you
there
so then the part of these science I
don't believe is that we can estimate
the the so what
you know that is it going to be a
catastrophe or not a catastrophe that
part of the science is is
so how many of you would uh agree with
my assessment number one
you're saying about the basic science of
adding CO2 would you agree with the
statement that you can't no
but you could put you could put a guess
on it
like is it 10 or 90 and even that you
will never know if you're right about it
right is it is that a more reasonable
way to approach it because ask yourself
have you ever been positive something
was true
to find out later it wasn't
and how many times has it happened this
year
how many times this year were you
positive something was true to find out
it wasn't
it's the most most common thing in the
world so if you think that you're
positive about climate change either
that the basic science is accurate or
not if you're positive well then you're
definitely not part of the reasonable
crowd right the reasonable crowd would
put a percentage on it if you were the
most Ardent pro-climate change scientist
if I trapped you in private
I could get you to say okay 99 chance
I'm right
but they're never going to say it's
binary
no real scientists would say that
um
all right
higher CO2 is a blessing for the planet
somebody says now would you say that uh
that's a 100 true
or do you just think that's more likely
true
somebody said that more CO2
and again there's no limit on what more
means so I guess more would mean there's
no limit to how much more that more CO2
with no limitations is just good for the
planet
how many people would say that there's
no limit to how much CO2 we can add to
the planet how many say that 100 sure no
limit
that would be a crazy opinion
that would be the craziest opinion of
all there's there's a limit to just
about everything except
too much money right I'm not sure you
can be too attractive or too rich or too
healthy
but you can be too much of everything
else practically
uh
Dr
Umar Samir I'm going to block you
because you don't add anything you don't
add anything to this conversation I'd be
very surprised if you had anything to
life in general based on the poor
quality of your comments
put you in timeout
uh
somebody's asking me the thermal
conductivity of CO2
I'm pretty sure that that discussion is
not going to go anywhere useful
yeah let's not talk about it because but
when it comes to climate change people
I don't think people want to be rational
about it
do you the thing I don't think people
want to be rational about it because
people what people want is that the
changes that would be driven by a belief
either happened or don't happen so there
are people who want their gas price to
come down
and there are people who you know want
you know their taxes to go to this or
that
but
uh
um
how many times you think Scott's father
called the Moon while growing up
zero
pretty sure my father never swore of me
so here here's my mascot Frank listen to
this comment Scott do you think if you
spend equal time on Justin as my stepson
who died of a fentanyl overdose as you
did stroking your ego on the internet
that he might be alive today honest
question
now you see why I've I've promoted him
to mascot
because because this is a whole other
level
that's a whole other level
all right you're hidden on this channel
so Frank is uh
been deleted but you know do you wonder
if Frank is real
because I feel like he's been uh
like making it his hobby to troll me for
a long time
yeah I don't think Frank's real
could be a bot
well the Bots always take the steps on
approach
and so the Bots always go after
hahaha you're the Garfield guy
uh
if you're so smart why is your stepson
done
if you're so smart why'd you get married
or divorced
so the Bots always have like
three or four approaches
please silent Chuck Monk
somebody else on there was being bad
all right I will if I see it
oh I did a comic today about Rob Reiner
how would you like me to read that to
you you'd love it
so I don't go hard on Rob Reiner
um I'm in a different direction which
may surprise you so it's uh Dilbert and
the boss talking you can if you were on
locals you'd already see this
and the boss says it's time to tweet at
actor and producer Rob Reiner and call
him mummy head and dilber says why and
the boss says because he once played a
character on TV who was called Meathead
and Dilbert says and
the boss says and I disagree with his
political opinions Dilbert says so
the boss says therefore he must be
punished
and Dilbert says and what will and that
will accomplish exactly what
and then for two panels the boss thinks
so I like these panels where he's just
thinking
because I don't have to write anything
in the last panel he's walking right
thinking I just realized I'm a jerk
um I think that's what uh
Frank Rizzo was realizing
Frank decided that coming and tweeting
the worst things in the world at me live
stream
to try to ruin ruin the fun for
everybody else he decided that was a
good use of his time
does he know why
there is only one reason Frank
I just realized I'm a jerk
I just realized I'm a jerk
yeah so my problem with calling Rob
Reiner a meathead is that it is too
npc-like
it's just too boring
like I kind of like you know responding
to them in clever ways that's fun that's
what Twitter is for
but just calling them a meathead and
saying well there's there's me head's
opinion
please don't do that
because it bores me to the point of pain
it's like oh
another person thinks that's the first
person who thought of that
if it's the first person if it's the
first thing you think of to say
just assume everybody else thought of it
too
just assume that
what about calling them a beta
you know
I think I'm ready to retire this whole
beta Alpha thing
Frank Rizzo is the name they used in The
Jerky Boys album oh that would make
sense
you know I'm I'm ready to retire the
alpha beta thing
because I'm not sure there are uh the
alphas are really Alpha
you know what I mean I'm not sure it
means what it used to mean
wow let me ask you this
say you're a woman and your biological
impulse is you wanna you wanna mate who
can protect you
like physically protect you
who could protect somebody better
something he was six foot four and the
MMA fighter
or me
if you're going to marry an MMA fighter
who's six foot four
or me
which one of them is going to keep you
safer for the long run
it's not even close
it's not even close
now to take me out let's take me out of
the equation right so instead of me
let's just say uh
uh Elon Musk Elon Musk so who would keep
you safer well I mean these are special
cases famous I'll just say a billionaire
who would keep you famous a nerdy
billionaire
or an MMA fighter
so it's not me it's just some nerdy
billionaire
nerdy billionaire or MMA fighter who
keeps you safer if you're a woman
okay it's a trick question it's not even
close the billionaire right because the
things that could threaten you
in terms of like somebody beating you up
they exist those are real risks but
they're kind of rare
relative to all the other risks like
being poor or you know being you know
unfairly jailed or hanging around with
the wrong people you know just all kinds
of health problems
yeah living in a dangerous neighborhood
all the things that the billionaire can
protect you from legal problems you name
it probably live longer
jar jar Spinks Sphinx says Scott equates
himself with Elon
the the I I often talk about that kind
of comment as one of the dumbest it's
actually
um in loser think as one of the examples
of loser think
so good for you for doing a chapter of
my book called Loser think
so congratulations on that
all right
so
who was the who's the alpha in the
situation where you got the MMA fighter
or the billionaire who made his own
money so let's say it's a billionaire
nerd who made their own money the honest
way they were just smart they worked
hard made their own money who's the
alpha
I know
so I think the whole what is Alpha is
all mixed up now
isn't it
oh jar jar was joking okay
the MMA fighter is the alpha because he
could beat up the nerd
could he and the nerd wouldn't have him
killed after that
well let me ask you this what would
happen if
if an MMA nerd
um like cornered me and beat me up
but I knew his name
I knew who he was how would that turn
out for the MMA fighter
what would I do
you don't think I'd kill him
of course I would
one way or another
if somebody actually like just captured
me and like you know beat me to
hospitalization
but I knew their name and where they
lived
I would kill them for sure not that was
not the slightest chance I wouldn't kill
him
I mean I'd do it one way or the other
but of course I'd kill him I might do it
legally I might do it cleverly am I hire
somebody might do it myself if I got mad
enough
but I would definitely kill him
so the thing is you can't you can't tell
who the alphas are
yeah you can't tell who the alphas are
talking about a post to truth world
that's all we talk about
we live in a world where you can't trust
anybody is truth
um Arkansas yeah
your husband thinks exactly this way
exactly
all right you'd go to prison though not
necessarily
you think I'd go to prison for murder
would do you think I would murder
somebody in a way that I was likely to
be caught
I wouldn't do that
unless I was willing to you know take
myself out at the same time now in the
real world it's nearly impossible to
kill somebody and get away with it
wouldn't you say
uh would you agree that murdering
somebody if you have a connection to
them if it's a random murderer or a
gangbird or you can still get away with
it but if it's like a direct planned
murder of somebody that you have a
connection to and a motive
well that's going to be really hard to
get away with because as soon as they
have a suspect they can get you
right so you'd have to make sure that
you would never even be a suspect I
don't know how you do that
I don't know anyway you could murder
somebody in 2022. so let me say this
clearly
don't murder anybody unless you're
willing to go to jail
because I don't think you can get away
with it if they know you
uh just give the cops a better suspect
yeah Epstein's sort of a special case
we don't know the story there
there's a Seth Rich laptop that can't be
true
oh really
all right
um how does this fit with your
simulation I don't know I think it all
fits
um you would snitch on me
walking back now I'm not walking it back
I'm telling you I can't think of any way
to do it but I would think one
I'd figure it out I just haven't put
enough time into it
one way or another I'd figure it out
talk about the Jimmy Kimmel response to
Elon I haven't seen it can you can you
paste that in the comments so Jimmy
Kimmel said something funny to Elon
uh if you if you know what that was
let me know
um
how would Kerry Lake do in a debate with
Hillary
as far as I can tell
let me let me uh pause for a moment
before I make this statement
I think Carey Lake would be a hundred
percent of All American politicians in
any debate
is that too strong
at the moment there's nobody on her
level
she it so here's the thing
if you're looking at all the persuaders
and you're asking yourself is Kerry Lake
like one of the best or the best
Persuader you're actually undersellinger
all of the other persuaders are in their
own like League
and she's the only one
who is in this other league
is empty except for her
now
she's better than Trump
because she's she's provocative without
going too far he goes too far into the
you know maybe maybe there's a dog
whistle there did I hear a dog whistle
but I don't think I've heard it from her
critics I don't think she's going
anywhere near anything that's dog
whistly right not that I've heard of I
would have heard it by now
so in my opinion she actually occupies a
zone that nobody's in she's actually
alone
if you say to santis I would say
DeSantis is the best of the people who
are in the lower league
she would destroy him
yeah this is very much like uh you
probably saw this on the internet there
was some discussion
uh about how good women's professional
soccer is
and some high school I think some high
school team beat them or something other
boys
uh
so when I when I say Carrie Lee Carey
lake is in a different League
I mean there would never be a fair fight
it would just never be a fair fight I
think I think DeSantis
and Trump are very similar in
persuasionability
with Trump having that extra you know
Glitz and Firepower and everything else
whereas DeSantis probably is better at
staying out of trouble
so you know that could work either way
but but right now there's nobody in Cary
Lake's League
and you know for a while there I thought
AOC
would be you know among one of the best
communicators and I think she is one of
the best still on the left but she's not
in Kerry Lakes League they're they're
not in the same strata
and by the way I'm uh
let me be clear when I talk about Carrie
Lake's skills that's all I'm talking
about
okay
so this is one of those cases where
somebody's going to say I'm promoting
Carrie Lake I'm promoting her in the
same way I promoted AOC
that her skill level is unusual it's
unusual and that's really worth pointing
out but I didn't support aoc's policies
I don't I'm not sure I know exactly what
Kerry Lake's policies are I have a
pretty good idea but for example I would
disagree with her on Fentanyl
so I think her first line of of policy
on fentanyl is build the wall
and I say that's somebody who is acting
like they don't understand the problem
which is unusual because her game is
very strong so on fentanyl I don't agree
with her
and I would back anybody who had a
better idea on fentanyl basically
where do you put Tulsi in terms of
communicators
well tulsi's communication and
persuasion style is you know commercial
grade
you know National politician level
so she has you know all the tools
but
she doesn't have the uh
the Kerry lake has an extra gear
that just nobody has
so Tulsi I would say is uh you know one
of the better communicators within the
standard world
but I don't think she has like an extra
gear
she's just really solid commercial grade
you know National politician grade which
are all pretty good
Scott was duped by AOC
duped
really
duped I have exactly the same opinion I
always had
which is that she's good at getting
attention which is good persuasion
you agree with that you have the same
opinion of her that I do exactly the
same
would you put Candace on par with Carrie
Lake no no
Candace would be another example of
the very best in the normal universe
right you know Kansas is up there in the
DeSantis
you know Realm
I think I think she's
you know maybe just a notch below
DeSantis
because the thing that um
Candace does is she'll go a little bit
further into
the speculative
than DeSantis does
and I think she goes a little bit too
far into it and that's where she'll lose
some people on the other side
so uh I think Carrie Lake
goes pretty far but she seems to stay
with the provable
like that the easily demonstrably
obviously true actually that's what's
the strongest thing about Carrie Lake
the strongest thing about her is she
doesn't say crazy
yeah we've all been waiting for that
right
someone who's just like a really strong
politician who doesn't say crazy
now maybe she didn't I missed it but I
haven't heard any
right am I right she she staked out
um aggressive
sensibleness like nobody could see the
trouble is it you can't sell
reasonableness
because nobody wants to see it it's
boring
here's what she did all right here I
think I finally figured it out
she solved the puzzle that nobody ever
solved before
which is how can somebody who is
sensible get a lot of attention
nobody's ever solved that before
that's that's the secret I just figured
it out that she's making sounding
sensible
exciting ah
because all those examples we keep
seeing where she she tears down the uh
the people asking the questions when she
goes after the media
she does it so sensibly and
um
say like clinically
that it's really entertaining and all it
was was sensible
who's ever done that before
well you know Reagan was the great
communicator but he still was
uh it was a different vibe
different vibe
yeah
she actually made sensible sexy
right she made being sensible sexy
because let's let's be real
she's sexy
she's sexy I would be surprised if she
doesn't appeal to both men and women and
all of lgbtq as being sexy
and here I'm not talking about even just
her looks right her looks are strong
but there is more about her am I right
it's more about her vibe
that I would bet appeals to Across the
entire spectrum of different people
and she pulls that off by being sensible
it's a weird thing
yeah so I think it's the combination of
being so skilled and being a you know
Republican and then being sexy and then
also being sensible
we haven't seen
I haven't seen that before and not that
smart
she sticks to undeniable facts I that's
what I've observed but I haven't watched
Jesus Christ You're such awful people
over here
uh
I'll hide you on this channel
all right yeah she had a lot of TV
experience that certainly helps
all right that's all for now YouTube
I'll talk to you tomorrow
and stay all
