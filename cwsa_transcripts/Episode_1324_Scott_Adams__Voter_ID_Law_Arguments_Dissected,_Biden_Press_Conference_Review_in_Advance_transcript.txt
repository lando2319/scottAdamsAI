come on in here
come on get in here i know
you're scrambling to get your beverage
ready you should have been up a little
bit earlier
now you know don't you well
there are a lot of things that could go
wrong today
it's possible but none of them will
matter
once you've had the simultaneous sip oh
yeah the problems will still be there
but you won't care about them nearly as
much in fact
i often like to look at the world this
way
do you have problems or do you have
insufficient coffee yeah see where i'm
heading with this right
i don't think you have problems i think
you have
insufficient coffee and we're going to
fix that right now although you don't
need coffee
could be anything but you need a cup or
a margaret or glass a tanker tell us to
sign a canteen juggle flash vessel if
any kind filled with favorite liquid i
like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine of the day
thing that makes everything
better except the elections
for some reason it's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now
go
just as good as i was hoping maybe
better
well have you seen my mascot on twitter
a lot of you are not famous but when you
get famous
you can get a mascot now
excuse me he doesn't think he's a mascot
but i don't think that's up to him he
thinks he's my critic
who spends all of his days researching
old tweets i've made
to put them into the comments section of
anything i tweet
to criticize me now of course
everything's out of context
and his criticisms uh are non-sensible
but rather than blocking him which would
be too easy
because he seems to have dedicated a
good part of his day
every day to just
trying to say bad things about me on my
twitter feed
so i decided to reframe him as my mascot
because mascots are silly and you don't
really care what they do
they just draw attention to you so
here's my mascot from now on
and i referred to him as my mascot and
he tried to respond to that with a
a clever rejoinder now
here is a problem i'm a professional
humorist
he's a guy who spends most of his day
criticizing a stranger
he can't really compete in this
reframing stuff
but he tried and he's a very a
very entertaining mascot now i've used
this reframe before and it's one that
you can use
i've told you this before back when i
owned a restaurant one of the employees
decided to
do a protest so he staged his own
protest every day with a little sign
just by himself in front of the
restaurant and day after day he'd be
there
and my manager at the time said you know
you know what do we do about this and i
said do about it
why would you want to fix anything not
everybody gets a mascot
and so we redefined the protester as a
mascot
and as soon as we did it just was fun
and i'd come by it's like hey where's
the mascot oh he was just here
he'll be back in a while took a break
so you can reframe things from problems
to mascots and watch how it stops
bothering you
twitter user roly-poly i had a
good suggestion for your job right if
you have a boss
here's a good suggestion you can employ
this
and he says in a tweet he goes anytime
you need to admit a mistake to a boss
or a client bring up this suez canal
ship
disaster talk to them about it for two
to four minutes
get them thinking about how many
billions of dollars one person's mistake
cost then tell them about your mistake
it'll look smaller
completely that it's just completely
true
now it's funny but it's completely true
that would literally work so roly-poly
has been paying attention
so uh joe biden put kamal harris in
charge of the migrant crisis
so now she has a portfolio what do you
make of that
is it because the migrant
crisis is a big problem so you need to
put
you know your your highest firepower on
that job
is that why maybe
um somebody suggested it so that he
won't that biden won't have to answer
questions about immigration he'll just
refer the questions to harris
maybe maybe a little bit that's
certainly a benefit side benefit
but i have a hypothesis that he hates
her
because can you think of anything that
would be a worse job
than to be a democrat and an
ex-prosecutor
and being put in charge of immigration i
literally can't think of a worse penalty
because she's been so nice to him
i mean other than calling him a giant
racist during the primaries
if you don't count that she's been
really nice to him
and he rewards her by giving her the one
job she can't possibly succeed at
it's like an impossible to succeed
situation
because the democrat philosophy
makes it impossible to do anything
practical so
i feel like i feel like joe biden hates
kabul harris
and he's just you know he's showing us
in a very uh
very beta way all right
or it could be just the vice president's
cat portfolios
and that was hers that's the other
possibility
um when biden was asked about the press
conference that he will be having today
we're all waiting for that that'll be
interesting i'll be watching that
and biden when when he was asked if he
was preparing for the press conference
biden said what and then the question
was repeated
and they said what press conference
are you worried yet
[Laughter]
now my interpretation of this is that he
was joking
because it's very much like the dad
jokes he likes to do
you know you just when uh what is it
when peter ducey would ask him you know
who are you going to appoint
to do whatever he likes to quip
you i'm gonna point you it's just sort
of his dad joke
brushing something aside so i'm pretty
sure he was joking
about saying what press conference uh
given that it was such a big story and
everything it was funny
well or he thought it was funny but here
is my
professional humorist advice
on a self-deprecating humor
now self-deprecating humor is not
something that everybody should
try there's a right way to do it
and a wrong way to do it a good
self-deprecating humor would be
oh i uh i have to do whatever my
my spouse tells me to do or my secretary
is really the one who's in charge or
or uh well i i don't know what i was
thinking i was so dumb
but you don't really take those as being
too serious
right the person doing the
self-deprecating humor
is clearly not really insulting
themselves they're
they're they're so much in power that
they can insult themselves
without really any risk but here's what
you
don't want to do if you've got some uh
some accusations or suspicions that you
might have dementia
you don't want to play a joke
where it looks like you have dementia
i'm just saying in the world of
self-deprecating humor
don't do the one that actually looks
true
right you want to do the
self-deprecating on the things that
people think
is not true so for example if they think
you're very smart and capable
and they're not going to change their
mind about that because of your whole
history of being smart and capable
you can do a little self-deprecating
humor about the time you messed up
but if they think you have dementia
you don't want to do self-deprecating
humor about maybe you do
because that makes you look like you
have dementia because it's not very
smart
all right um so what's going to happen
is
at this bite in press conference
how do you think it's going to go what's
your prediction do you think he will
gaff out do you think he'll make such
such a mistake it'll be a giant disaster
what do you think my prediction is he'll
do fine
he'll do fine because i think the press
will be very kind to him
i think they'll ask softball questions
the few people who don't let's say the
fox news people
he'll brush them aside and joke about
them and
say the canned thing that's written down
in front of him whatever
yeah he'll do fine i think he'll get
through it it would be surprising if he
didn't
it won't be great but don't you wonder
how the press will treat it well wonder
no more
because even though it hasn't happened i
am going to read you
some of the reviews of his press
conference
before they even happen are you ready
uh let me find here
um so i've i asked people to write
glowing reviews of biden's performance
today before it even happens
because you know you could write them
before they happen
all right uh
let's see what some of the uh so my
my priming uh joke was the cnn will
report after his press conference
orange man bad but dementia man good
world rejoices
let's see what other people said um
christopher hill says in review of
president biden's first presser
join us as we discuss what donald trump
was doing while it was televised
so nice to have president who that
doesn't lie
biden returns civility to press
conference
doesn't shy away from the tough
questions
president's favorite food is yeah it's
gonna be that kind of stuff
um let's see some more
in a refreshing change of pace this is
matt fitzgerald
and a refreshing change of pace from the
previous administration
biden's press conference was a
free-flowing exchange of ideas
based in confident mature leadership i
came and perhaps we all did
at least just a little bit
i should have read that to myself before
i read it to you
biden stumbles russia suspected msnbc
country unites around president as he
fixes everything
not the mean spirit answers we've been
accustomed to from the previous
administration
he showed an empathy we haven't seen in
four years
he really cares so
anyway that was fun you should read the
rest of them on my twitter feed
somebody asked on twitter today and i
wonder the same thing
how long before you can get banned from
social media
for saying that biden has dementia
it's coming isn't it i feel like that's
coming
although this seems a little bit more
like an opinion so maybe it'll last
longer but
um now my defense i've
prepared my defense in advance is that
no reasonable person would believe
anything i say
i think that's a pretty good defense so
no reasonable person would believe
anything i say so i'm safe
um according to rasmussen rasmussen
polls
biden's handling of the covenant 19
situation wins a majority approval
i'm starting to think that averages
don't make any sense in 2021 if you're
looking at political polling
because if you dig down a little bit it
says 30 of conservatives
think biden is doing a good job on covet
but 88
of liberals does it make sense to
average them
i mean i guess it does if you you know
to find out if you're over 50
is useful but i feel like the concept of
an
average for the country it doesn't make
any sense
because it's just two different groups
it's like
averaging an orange and an apple well
the
average of an orange and an apple is a
i don't know what it's a nothing there's
nothing that's the average of an origin
an apple
so uh i guess we still have to know
what's more than 50
for lots of reasons all right so there's
more
i feel as if every week is a new
governor cuomo
scandal and you think they're going to
be done
but no there's another one turns out
that maybe
the governor's governor of new york's
brother chris cuomo of cnn
may have had some special access to
testing and stuff when he had his
coronavirus infection now
how much do you care about that do you
care
too much that the governor's family gets
a little extra
a little extra resources during a
pandemic
i get the point you know the the point
is crystal clear
that you know people shouldn't be
jumping to the front of the line
but i got to tell you of all the things
i could be bothered about in the entire
world
i don't really care about a politician
taking care of their family
do you is that the thing you're going to
bother
worry about now if it had been a
lobbyist
i think i'd care a little bit more if a
lobbyist did it
but are we really gonna get down on
people for taking care of their family
really i get it i get it he shouldn't
have gone to the front
line slap in the hand
but i feel as if you can even make an
argument for it
that the you know the reason we have
security for our leaders but you don't
get security the reason that they get a
they get a private plane if they're
leaders but you don't get a private
plane
right so we do say that our leaders
should have some special i wouldn't say
rights but special treatment
because their influence you know is
leveraged
you know on all of us so you want to
make sure that the leaders
are the most effective they can be in a
way that doesn't apply to the rest of us
and i think if a leader has some problem
in the family
and he's got a brother that's maybe in
his ear
that making that problem go away is
worth something
hey hey i'm your brother give me some
testing
i'm trying to run the state here but i'm
your brother give me some testing
seriously i'm trying to run the state
but i'm your brother give me some
testing all right just give him some
testing
just give him some testing we'll be done
with this now i'm going to go run the
state
honestly i don't care about this at all
i realize it's part of the bigger story
but
um i wouldn't care if trump did it i
wouldn't care if a democrat did it
let him take care of their family i'm
okay with that
but i get the argument against it it's
not mysterious
let's talk about voter id laws you ready
all right here's here's the meaty part
of my show
today all right
so something like half of the country is
against
voter id laws i don't know what the
exact percentage is but it's usually
half
when we're talking about politics
but what's the argument and i keep
waiting to hear the argument
in favor of not requiring
id to vote and i assumed that there was
an argument
but i just wasn't aware of it so i did a
little bit of
research a little bit today and i'll
tell you what i found
so half of the country thinks that that
the republic would be better off
if the people without ids do get to vote
what's the argument for that have you
ever heard it
is the argument now it seems to me that
the argument
for having no voter ids
either has to be something that's good
for the republic
you know good for the country or it's
good for the individuals
who are doing the voting ideally it's
good for both right that would be the
win-win
but it's got to be good for at least one
of those two groups
or else why are we talking about it
right
so is it good for the republic
let's say would better decisions be made
if we threw into the mix the population
that does not have
identification is there anybody arguing
that it would be
that we would pick a more qualified
leader
or that we would have better decisions
or policies
if the people who can't get
identification or don't have it for
whatever reason
vote if you throw them in the mix do you
get better decisions
because i've never heard anybody argue
that and it seems counter-intuitive
right
so if it's not that what's the point
if you're not getting better decisions
what's the point
well here's another possibility the
other possibility is you don't want to
disenfranchise
american citizens you don't want people
to feel
that they're not part of the system
because then they won't
you know be cooperative and beneficial
and you know buying into the whole
process
and i i think we would all agree that if
citizens
buy into the system whether it's jury
duty or voting
or anything with the constitution the
more you can get people to participate
and buy in that's better
do we all agree the more participation
the better but here's the thing
do these people who don't have
identification
is voting in their top under priorities
if you went to them and you didn't tell
them that the topic was voting
you just say look i'm a researcher and i
want to ask this question
write me a list of all the things you
care about
your top priorities from top to bottom i
want to see a list
and make a hundred of them you know it
might take you all day but i want a
hundred
priorities for you and they probably
start out with you know
health and money and you know freedom
from crime
and get my kid an education and
you know and you know not have racism in
my life and
no gun violence maybe whatever and
after you got through the top hundred
how low would you have to be now
remember these are
unprompted these are people you just say
tell me your problems
don't don't don't answer a question
about voting just tell me your problems
where would this be it would not be in
the top hundred
would it because it seems to me that the
people who don't have id
certainly the poverty is you know maybe
the
almost certainly the the top reason for
that but i don't think they care
do they is there or let me put it this
way rather than
reading their minds let me say this is
there any evidence
that they care because i've never seen
any
so if it's not if if voting without id
is not beneficial to the republic
there's no argument that gives you
better decisions
and it's not necessarily good for the
people who don't have ids because they
don't
probably care and i haven't or i haven't
seen the evidence that they do
you know if somebody did a survey of it
that would be different i suppose
now so what's the point of it so
somebody pointed me to an aclu argument
so now we don't have to wonder right so
i was just guessing what's the point of
it
but now we're going to read the aclu's
argument
why we should not have voter id laws you
ready
now the aclu argues in public
so you got lawyers involved right expert
arguers
people were good at making their points
so if the aclu can't give me a good
argument for this
does it exist well let's find out if
they have one first
so here's what one of their articles
says number one voter id laws deprive
many voters of their right
to vote it def deprives them of the
right to vote that's the first statement
they make
is that true what do you think of that
does it deprive people of their right
to vote well i'm no constitutional
scholar
but does the constitution specify
that your right to vote includes any way
you want to do it
does it is that in there somewhere
because i'm no expert
but does the constitution say you have a
right to vote
and by the way any way you want to
no restrictions now i would like to vote
the following way
i would like to write my vote on a
napkin
then i'd like to wrap it around a brick
and
throw it through a window of congress
why can't i do that are you going to
restrict my right to vote that's the way
i want to do it
now some people want to do it without id
or maybe they don't have a choice
because they don't have id
but does the constitution guarantee me
a way to vote that i want to vote
because i don't remember that language
in the constitution all right let's go
on let's see what else
aclu says it would reduce participation
true or false true or false it would
reduce participation yes
so that's a good point right no it's not
it's not a point it's a fact
a fact is not an argument right
it's just a fact you need an argument
a reason a fact doesn't tell you
anything
so if it reduces the number of people
who votes
or even if it doesn't it's still just a
fact
it's not a reason so so far
i haven't seen a reason that makes any
sense have you let's keep reading
i'm sure they're getting to the good
stuff
oh here we go here's the kill shot i
thought there were no good reasons
but then the aclu gets to the
the meat event all right so the other
ones were
sort of weak but this one i think this
takes it home
all right so here's the strong argument
for why we don't want
voter id laws because it stands in
direct opposition
to our country's trend of including more
americans in the democratic process
what that's not a reason
is there a reason that we we can't stand
in direct opposition to a trend
was that in the constitution oh hold on
people hold on
oh stop what you're doing stop what
you're doing right now
i feel that some of you are doing things
i don't know exactly what you're doing
but i feel as some of you are doing
things that are in
opposition to a trend well that's no
good
stop it don't be don't be opposing a
trend
what the hell kind of reason is that
and if you think that i'm getting to the
good reason next
that was it that was the argument
it opposes a trend uh
that's not a reason
there's some implication that people
have a constitutional right
to vote in any way they want with no
restrictions
i don't believe that's in the
constitution
and it reduces the number of
participants
that's just the fact do you know what
else reduces the number of participants
not letting let's say russian citizens
vote in our election i don't think
that's fair
because if you don't let russian
citizens vote in your election
are you reducing the participation
so these aren't even reasons and here's
the
persuasion lesson i'll put on top of
this
do you see how easily you can be fooled
into thinking that there are reasons
because there are words but there aren't
any
there are literally no reasons i'm not
saying and i want to be careful here i'm
not telling you
that i've looked at the reasons and i
disagree with them
there are literally no reasons offered
you get that right
they're not saying we disagree with you
here's my reason
they're not offering any reasons
why is that well obviously the reason is
that your democrats want to win
elections
but they can't say that out loud so
here's my question
what do you think is a bigger problem
for people who don't have identification
that they didn't get to vote in an
election in which they don't understand
any of the issues let me make let me
make a statement
that i feel is fair to make that the
people who can't get it together to get
identification
in the united states now it does cost
something it could cost you a couple
hundred dollars gotta get your uh
got to get your birth certificate etc so
poverty is
a real reason not to have identification
that's real
but i don't feel like uh these people
are adding a lot to the the process
that's what i'm saying
and it has nothing to do with race you
know as soon as you think it's about
race
you're in a different conversation
because i'm not in that conversation
now here's another reason i don't think
it's specifically on the aclu thing
but that if you there's a gigantic
difference
in the what people have identification
than that
so there did you know that 11 of us
citizens don't have identification
did you have any idea it was that high
11 of us citizens
don't have any identification
did you know that i didn't know that i
actually thought that the number who
didn't i have identification was you
know trivial
i thought it'd be more like one percent
two percent tops
ten percent or i'm sorry eleven percent
but it's even worse than that if you go
down to the the racial component here
because
i think black americans are way less
likely to have identification than white
americans
so what you would end up doing oh here
it is
minority voters are disproportionately
lacking id this is also from the aclu
site
um nationally up to 25 of
african-americans
of voting age lack government-issued
photo id
are you kidding me are you kidding me
25 percent of black americans
who are a voting age don't have photo id
did you have any idea that it was that
high
i had no idea again i would have guessed
two percent
but 25 i'm off by you know 10 times
somebody says they're called children no
specifically they're saying
it's the number of people the people who
are of voting age
so specifically 25 of voting age
if you throw the children in there it's
like 50 right
so the first thing we have to realize is
we've got a real big
problem with identification
so which party is it who is saying let's
fix
this problem with no identification
because how are these people with no
identification
going to function in society and you
know move to the next level
what the hell can you do without
identification
how do you get a reasonable job without
identification
um so i would say that we should have a
national movement to get everybody
identified
and if it costs 200 to get
identification it should be free
why don't why doesn't the government
just you know in fact
here's something the republicans should
do if republicans are going to be on the
side of
you have to have id to vote they need to
put some money in it
put some money in it and say look we're
going to make it free
to get your birth certificate so you can
go through the process
or we're going to take all the birth
certificates and we're going to
digitize them so that you can just ask
the center
the the federal government for your id
and we'll just give it to you for free
because i assume that the reason you pay
for your birth certificate is
a hospital does it or the state or
somebody must be somebody who incurs
some costs to do that
take them away so
i would say that the republican argument
without
without a plan to get people ids is
bankrupt it's a bankrupt plan
so the republicans if they're not trying
to fix the problem of id
uh you can't give them any credit
no credit at all and the democrats
if they don't have an argument for their
society you can't give them any credit
at all
so you have two sides of this argument
neither of which
are doing the minimum to serve the
public
in my case in in my opinion neither the
republican
or the democrat side is doing the
minimum to serve the public on this
question because both of them should be
saying
at the very least let's get everybody id
separately we can talk about needing id
to vote
but why aren't we solving this problem
why do we talk about this year after
year
you know they should be free to get
identification in this country
because the government requires it let
me put it another way
if the government is going to charge you
to vote
the government is broken right you gotta
fix that
why are people being charged to vote
indirectly because you would have to pay
money to get id
and you need id to vote
so um
now the other the argument is that the
current situation
if you don't have voter id it would
cause
uh fewer black people to vote it would
disenfranchise more of black voters than
other kinds of voters and therefore is
racist
but here's the problem with that it's a
racist
outcome it's not necessarily
racist by intention although clearly
there are racists in the world who do
have those intentions
but everything is racist by outcome
isn't it can you think of any government
anything that doesn't have a racial
outcome that some group gets more or
less than the percentage of them
in the country there's nothing like that
so to say that this
is a problem because it gives you a an
uneven
racial outcome that's not a reason
because everything has that quality
literally everything
there's nothing that's big that affects
everybody that doesn't affect them
disproportionately
if only because of difference in
economic situation
so it's not an argument it's just a fact
that a root
people would be disproportionately
affected and i don't
agree with that i don't think we you
know i would like to have
more representative government but we're
not really
we're not going at it in any kind of
responsible way the responsible way
would be to get everybody some id for
free
that'd be the way to do it all right um
i saw i saw an article in publication
called the insider
and i don't know what to trust here but
i'm going to give you
something they said and give me a fact
check on this
it says the number of mass shootings in
the u.s this year
has already reached 103
as of march 22nd
do you believe that do you believe that
there have been 103
mass shootings this year already
now i suppose it depends what you call a
mass shooting
i think it means if somebody opens up
you know at a party and two people get
killed or
there's let's say a drive-by shooting
in which two people get killed by the
drive-by shooting
i don't know how many people have to die
before it's mass
is there a definition of that what makes
it mass
if it's two is that mass is it three
four or more somebody's saying somebody
says it's greater than one
but if anybody knows what it what that
number is anyway i don't believe this at
all
and in order to believe it i'd have to
see a lot more
information on it
here's some shocking news this is a set
of sky news
so there's a 2017 study that found that
sperm levels among men in western
countries has dropped by more than
50 percent over the past four decades
and they examined 185 studies involving
close to 45 000 healthy men so remember
they're all healthy
and uh somebody named dr swan believes
that
at this rate men will be unable to
produce
viable sperm by 2045.
what do you think of that so basically
it's the
the end of civilization now of course
there will always be some people who can
in china for example
we could have we could have chinese
babies
so we could get sperm from china in 2045
because they'll have plenty of it but we
won't have any
and then we could just uh since the
women will still be
fully functional apparently we can just
get them impregnated with
some of that sperm from china and uh
there you go
so there's your future china wins
now the first thing is is this study
true do you believe that it's true
that men's um sperm levels have dropped
i think so i would think so
because i would also think the drop in
testosterone
is probably probably related
or at least have the same cause am i
going too far into the
medical unknown where i should not even
be talking
and nobody here should believe anything
i say about medicine or health
but no
i i don't know how if i should worry
about this or not
well i won't be here probably i'll i'll
be uh by then i will have
evolved into pure software so it's not
going to be a problem for me
yeah i would say observationally this is
one of the filters that
that you should use if you see a
scientific study
that doesn't match your observation you
should be skeptical
now that doesn't mean your observations
are reliable that's why we do science
but if they don't match in a very
obvious way
you should ask some questions but if you
hear that people's
let's say men's testosterone level has
decreased greatly
in recent years that matches observation
doesn't it if i had to ask you i'm not
going to show you any studies but what
do you think
you know just sort of look around what
do you think do you think the
testosterone level is a little lower
i think most people would say yeah it
looks like it and so
the science and the observation match
doesn't mean it's true
but it's better than not matching well
there's always a new scare when it comes
to the coronavirus
and here's my favorite in the news india
has discovered a new
quote double mutant variety of covet 19.
that's right no longer
will we be simply dealing with a single
covet problem we're going to have a
double special
mutants and when the double
special mutants come after you
well you're in trouble now how worried
should you be about all these
double mutant uh monster covent
things well i wouldn't be unworried
it seems like a reasonable thing to be
worried about
i would expect that most of these will
be susceptible to the virus and
or to the vaccinations etc but
i will just add this to the story
the only thing i want to add to the
story is this
this story would have happened no matter
what
so if you say to yourself uh oh there's
a story
about a double mutant variant
do you say to yourself that now i should
worry about it
well maybe but i would submit to you
that there always was going to be this
story
and maybe not with the same words but
there's a guarantee
because of the the nature of the press
and the media
that they needed to find the extra scary
thing
when the scary thing was starting to
diminish so that
the nature of the press guaranteed this
story would exist
but what is not guaranteed is that
there's any substance to it
or that you really need to worry about
it so to make yourself feel better about
these
double mutant variants which sound
pretty scary
just know that the story would have been
here
whether there was any danger or not
all right um
and that is just about what i want to
talk about
i'm going to look at your comments for a
moment here
just looking at some of your comments
here
how is 1984 coming so i told you i was
going to read the book
1984 which amazingly i'd grown to this
age without having read yet
and i bailed out so i'm not going to
finish the book
because it's unfinishable and here's the
reason why
i do not consume media
that is a bummer that makes me feel bad
i got the i got the sense of it i could
read the cliff notes
i don't need to like live in the world
of this guy who's suffering
for an entire book and anybody who does
that i don't understand why you do that
are you reading the book for
entertainment so
when it stops entertaining and it just
starts hurting
like it actually just hurts to read that
book
because it makes me feel bad so
why would you read a book that makes you
feel bad
why would you watch a movie with sad
things in it
it's just bad strategy why would you
listen to a
music that makes you feel bad thinking
about your
your maytu cheating on you or whatever
just don't do it just stay away from all
the media
that is fill you with bad thoughts
you're not gonna
you're not gonna miss anything because
it isn't too hard to know what 1984
is about just read the wikipedia page
you're done
you know give yourself 15 seconds of
pain
to learn something you don't need four
hours of pain
to learn 15 seconds of useful stuff
so stop watching crappy movies stop
watching
reading bad books if they don't teach
you
or make you happy skip it
because bad news should be condensed
not expanded the last thing i want to do
is read about
somebody's fictional problems
i got plenty of problems the world has
plenty of problems
i'm not going to read fiction with
problems
that's the last thing i want
all right
you can't take it too seriously yeah
what are your best systems well you can
see some of my best systems in my book
cattle failed almost everything and
still win
big but diet and fitness
are probably the the top of the pile if
you get your diet and fitness right
pretty much everything else is going to
work out better than it would have
you know your happiness your quality of
life your your ability to get jobs your
ability to just physically feel good
your ability to attract a mate
if you get diet and fitness right
there's a whole cascade of good things
that happen
after that so those are my two most
important systems i will do a micro
lesson on both of those
they're both individual chapters in my
book now the difference between
a diet and a system
is pretty big right a diet you usually
just try to
you know eat differently and use your
willpower and stuff like that
whereas a system is something that you
do every day that just makes it easy to
lose weight or to maintain the right
weight
so if you have a system you're not
really working
the the system does all the work for you
if you have a diet
you're doing all the work which is why
it doesn't work you know people are not
successful with diets
but you can be successful with the
system i'll give you that
i gave you this simple example but if
you haven't heard it one of my
one of the systems i use for diet is i
don't keep bad food in my house
so i take advantage of my own laziness
that when i'm hungry
i'm gonna use something that's already
in the house and none of it's bad
now that's just one thing it's not the
whole system right you need
you need a number of these little
systems to add up to a bigger system
but it's not easy how hard is it to ease
something that's already in the house
there's no effort i just pick it up and
eat it and that's it and then i've
i've participated in a diet
but i didn't do anything i just picked
up what was in the house and ate it
that's it
uh-huh somebody says it is easy for you
you don't care about food that's exactly
right yeah the most important thing you
need to know about
um diet is that we have different
cravings
and desires for food and it will be much
easier for people like me
because i don't have those cravings as
much as other people
it is however true that everybody no
matter what your level of craving is
can greatly reduce you know the pain of
dieting by having good systems
so yeah some people will be better than
others but the systems work for
everybody
they're universal
somebody says the willpower starts at
the grocery store i disagree
i disagree the willpower starts before
you go to the grocery store
because if you went there hungry you did
it wrong
that's a bad system right shopping while
you're hungry
is a bad system so just don't do that
um somebody says i have the extreme
opposite
i like food so little it's a discipline
t i do know people like that i know
actually several people like that who
for them eating
is just a chore they'd rather not do it
at all can go all day without eating
hungry and stoned not a good combo yeah
so here's a system if you are a
marijuana user marijuana users know that
they get the munchies and they eat a lot
so what would be a system
to reduce that and i'll tell you my
system and it works every time
just use mouthwash immediately after you
uh
immediately after you smoke if you're
smoking actual
smoke forget which one i use is
colgate or something i think that's the
one that works the best but
uh if you just do mouthwash immediate
laughter it gets rid of
your cotton mouth it just gets rid of it
and you don't get hungry because there's
something about the mouth
feeling that triggers your hunger it
doesn't seem to be
entirely a mental thing so brush your
teeth
use mouthwash you won't even think of
eating
it just won't even be fun uh
somebody says joe uses listerine i don't
know if it's for the same purpose
uh paw smokers have low t
i don't know about that
um financial literacy tips
financial literacy tips have i not done
a
micro lesson on personal finance i think
i did that within the locals
uh platforms that's a seven dollars a
month to subscribe
and by the way my my goal with the
locals
stuff that's a platform for
people who want to subscribe to my extra
content i try to make sure that if
you're paying seven dollars a month
for my content that you always get
way more than seven dollars worth of uh
useful life benefit
so that's what i'm trying to do you're
it's not just going to be for some
laughs
you're gonna get some practical stuff
every month that when you say to
yourself was that worth seven dollars
you'll just laugh
because you say seven i would have paid
thousands for that
but i got it for seven dollars so that's
what i'm shooting for uh most people
who are uh subscribers and there are
thousands of them now
um are saying it's worth it they're
saying it's worth it
all right somebody says you've lost me
scott maybe i have
um i don't know that somebody's asking
about periscope going away
my understanding is that something's
getting folded into twitter
itself i don't know if it's going to be
periscope-like
i don't know so i don't know any details
of that um someday if this isn't here
just go to youtube and google me and
i'll pop right up
so you can find me on uh youtube and by
the way also on rumble
so every time youtube demonetizes me
i do a commercial for rumble on twitter
i've only done it once yet but that's my
new system
so if i get demonetized for reasons that
i think are
unreasonable which i think all of them
are
then i'll just do a commercial for
rumble every time and you can find my
stuff there
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you tomorrow
all right youtubers i usually give you a
little extra
you want a little extra
um talk about the sim i think i talk
about that too much
how should we develop people's uh
financial literacy
well uh some of you know some years ago
i created a
i think it was nine points just nine
bullet points
of what you needed for personal finance
and that those nine bullet points
are the whole show because every one of
those bullet points you could kind of
easily
just google to find out more about it
you just need to know what the order is
and what the priority is
so for example among the nine tips
i would tell people to if they have
extra money beyond their expenses
to get a open an account as say charles
schwab
or a discount broker now if i don't give
the details
about how to open an account at charles
schwab or a discount broker
you can just google it so just knowing
that you should do that
is kind of all you need because you just
google it
very easily we'll tell you how to sign
up likewise if i tell you how to
that you should have let's say i tell
you you should have a 401k
and you don't know what that is just
google it
and you'll say oh it's one of these
something from my employer
ask your employer if they have one of
those you probably already know
but you could ask them they say no we
don't have that or yes we do here's how
to sign up
so it's very easy to have financial
literacy
you need about nine bullet points and
you're done
because the way i organize them is you
do them in order
so you wouldn't have to work on all nine
you work on the top one
the top one says pay off your credit
card
what else do you need to know that's it
pay off your credit card
don't buy stocks until you pay off your
credit card
don't do anything financially until you
pay off your credit card
and it's really easy because that's your
highest interest rate you couldn't
possibly make that much money in the
stock market reliably
you could but not reliably
so um somebody's saying where is it
google
google my name and
personal finance list
or something it should pop up it's all
over the internet
it's in a number of my books as well
oh i see somebody's listing the uh the
list and the comments here
so believe it or not it's actually
easy to teach people personal finance
it's literally one page
and they just have to you know tack it
to their wall
and work on the top one and just work
their way down
very easy none of it is complicated in
the least
um did i check out decentral land yet i
did not
i i figure i can tell from the uh
the name of it what that's all about but
maybe i'll look into that
are the when tokens any good anymore
they're still trading
their value is low because the
underlying company doesn't exist
but they live forever they can't go away
because they're part of the blockchain
and there there is a new app under
development that would use them as its
token so anything that creates a demand
for that token
can increase its value so in fact
anybody out there who
wants to start an app and just use a
token that already exists
could do that
struggling to understand financial
jargon question mark
yeah um that's so that's a good point
but everything this financial jargon is
easy to google
right when you come into the word just
look it up next word just
look it up you'll get there pretty
quickly there's really not a lot of
complexity to it
the reason that finance seems so
complicated
is is that the the number of things you
could know
is gigantic you like the things you
could know is just huge
the things you need to know to have a
hundred percent of everything you need
to know is just like
this pinpoint of all the things you need
to know
because if you understand diversity or
i'm sorry
diversification if you understand how to
diversify your portfolio
and you know how to open a charles
schwab account
and you know that you want to pay off
your debts that are higher interest
rates first
you're almost completely done you're
almost done
i mean that's that got you to 90 percent
of everything you need to know
and it took me three sentences
um
uh sunk costs is a good thing to know
about yeah there are a lot of
psychological
uh let's say obstacles to being a good
investor
that you should learn about as well but
if you get an index fund you don't have
to worry
about that either
do i own guns there's a question i would
never answer
would you answer that question if
somebody asks you in public if you own
guns would you answer that question you
shouldn't
never answer that question that would be
the worst question you could ever answer
here's my answer i'm very pro-second
amendment
so if you want to mess with my house
that's all you know
all right the rest you're gonna have to
guess i'm pro-second amendment
and if you're in my house and you mean
no good i could kill you in a heartbeat
i mean just
i'm just telling you my mindset if you
came in my house to do harm to me
in any in any sense i could kill you in
a heartbeat
i wouldn't hesitate for a second and i'm
pro-second amendment
so do you want to know if i own a gun
you don't get that information so
with your hands i could easily kill
somebody with my bare hands
if i had to right if i didn't have a
reason of course not
let's talk about nfts i'm seeing a lot
of questions there
so you all know what nfts are they're a
it's a digital art
that because it's attached to the
blockchain
um you can you can show that you have an
original
or one of the originals so that creates
value and allows people to trade them
and it's like
it's like any other art that can go up
in value
but the the dilbert nft is
it's already created but it hasn't been
published yet for you to buy
we're working on some technical stuff
behind the scenes because it turns out
when you actually get ready to
publish your nft there are a whole bunch
of technical decisions
and technical things you need to set up
one of them
is to allow you to buy it with us
dollars as opposed to
having to have uh let's say a bitcoin to
even buy the nft
so part of the reason it's taken me a
few weeks is uh we
we just got things set up so that you'll
be able to buy it with just regular
money
and you don't have to have a crypto to
do it
do i own a gun safe i'm not going to
tell you if i own a gun safe
if i'm not going to tell you if i own
guns
to my own swords
all right that's all for now and i will
talk to you
later
