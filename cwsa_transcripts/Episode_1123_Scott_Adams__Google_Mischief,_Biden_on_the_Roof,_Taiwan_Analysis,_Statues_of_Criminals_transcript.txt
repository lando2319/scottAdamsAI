hey everybody
come on in come on in it's going to be a
fun week
yeah it's going to be one of the better
weeks wait till you see the news
that's coming at you this week i don't
know what it is yet
but i think you'd all agree it's going
to be interesting
might be terrible might be good
but it's going to be interesting and in
order to prep yourself to enjoy this
week
all you need is a copper mug or a glass
of tanker chelsea's tie the canteen
joker flask
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee and join
me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the
thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens right now
go
ah delightful
so i was just before i got on i was
reading an article by uh joel pollock
and breitbart about how the atlantic
you know the atlantic the
the dumbest publication in the world uh
has some kind of a uh editorial or
opinion piece this says
that unless joe biden gets elected
there'll be all kinds of civil unrest
and therefore
if you're a republican and you don't
want civil unrest
you should vote for biden because it's
the only way you can avoid it
what does that make you want to do well
if i have those
two choices which is to be blackmailed
into voting for somebody
i don't want to be president in order to
avoid
civil unrest i'll take the civil unrest
i don't i don't think they're reading
the room right because those are not
even
close to being similar choices let me
put it this way on a scale of one to ten
my desire to avoid civil unrest is
pretty high
it's pretty high it's like a maybe an
eight out of ten
but my desire to not be blackmailed is a
25.
they're they're not really close you
know if you give me that choice
you guarantee i'm voting like any
thought i had about
sitting on the couch is like nope if if
you want the uh
if you want the riots you want the civil
unrest
let's do it let's let's bring it on
let's get it over with
because i'm definitely not choosing the
safe path
and anybody who thinks that republicans
would
choose the safe path with those two
choices
definitely reading the room wrong
i just saw a story that says that china
has collected
massive personal information about
australians
i assume they're doing the same thing
for every other country
but we i guess they got caught more or
less red handed with
the australian data now here's the thing
i i feel like the days of
um kinetic warfare
among the big countries the countries
that have you know nukes and stuff
it might be over but not war
because i think that that ai and
persuasion
and dirty tricks and cyber stuff
is now so powerful that you could take
down a country
and you could you could destroy an
economy you could
you could cause civil unrest it's
happening right now
so i think the reason we don't have to
worry too much
about getting into a shooting war with
some of the other big countries that
you know are the the classic ones you
worry about
is that shooting is the least effective
weapon
the one thing you can count on is that
if you're
up against another military they're
going to use their good weapons
as opposed to their bad weapons and bad
weapons would be anything that got them
killed
in return so if they were to you know
say bomb the homeland here
well their homeland would get bombed but
if all that happens is there's lots of
unrest in the united states
and it looks like it's domestic but we
don't know why
but it's actually because of ai and
persuasion and
propaganda coming in from another
country we wouldn't even necessarily
know we were under attack
i mean maybe the government would know
but the people wouldn't really quite get
it
and we just think well we're not so
gullible that
a few memes on facebook are going to
change our minds
but ai and
the weapons of persuasion are now so
powerful
that i would say legitimately they're
they're more powerful than
physical weapons because you could you
could wipe out a country
without being attacked in return or even
identified as the attacker
so way more powerful so that's
that's something to worry about i would
argue that the ai
is already destroying
civilization and that unless we figure
out some way to stop it
there's there's somewhat of a obvious
path here
because as many people have noted the
algorithms and the social networks and
the you know i guess you can say
algorithms
driving the news in general are
designed to make us fight with each
other
now that's not some great insight
everybody smart says that at this point
but what's going to stop that
what would stop it if if you had said to
me
20 years ago oh you know the fake news
and the persuasion will get so strong
that
you know it'll be changing politics and
changing the world and all that
i don't know if i would have completely
believed how good it could get
i would have i would have worried about
it but i don't know if i would have been
convinced
but now we're here and we can see that
half of the country believes and
literally hoaxes
that they believe our reality they
actually can't tell the difference
between an obvious hoax you know did the
president say
we should drink bleach no how hard would
it be to
find out that's not true well if you if
you follow conservative media it's easy
because you see the debunks all the time
if you follow
the other silo of news you've never seen
it and you never will
so if you had told me we could ever get
to a point
where you could sell somebody literally
a hoax
that could be debunked as quickly as you
can google it
and yet is still worked it could be
debunked with one google search and yet
it still stands
i don't know if i would have believed
that so how good
how good can this type of weapon get
well that's the scary part we don't
really know
here's what's scary right now the
persuasion
that most of us are receiving from the
social media companies and from
foreign actors to the extent that
they're trying to interfere
most of that is sort of sprayed into the
environment
in other words the the meme that you see
might not be that different than the
meme
i see maybe it looked for things like
you know
your gender or your age you know who you
voted for
some basic stuff but what happens when
let's say
china knows everything about you about
you
you specifically they know the names of
your children
they know your hobbies they know where
you've traveled they know all your
social media posts when they know all
that stuff
the the form of persuasion that they can
send to you specifically
is a whole different level as a
trained hypnotist let me give you a
really a perfect example of this if i
tried to hypnotize
all of you right now it would
sort of work you know i could influence
a number of you
maybe 20 of you would be moved 80 would
not
but the the limit there is that i would
have to use the same method for all of
you
and the same method doesn't work for
everybody it's not it's not really a
one-size-fits-all situation
but suppose i had infinite time
and i could take each of you
individually learn all about you
how you you know how you're wired what
what makes you tick
what you care about and then i design a
specific persuasion package
just for you and then i stay on it
would i be able to get more people
brainwashed
yeah it would reverse from maybe twenty
percent of the people getting influenced
to
closer to any percent if i had time to
you know work on it individually
so it's it's that big and going from
you know maybe 20 percent getting
influence to 80
influenced that's the next step
and all they need to do is collect
enough information
and have something like a tick tock or
some
some other kind of social you know
social connection
they can get a guess something going
virally so that's where things are going
there's news today that oracle
is going to do some kind of a deal with
tick tock not buy them
but do some kind of a deal now i'm very
curious what that deal would look like
because i can't see any scenario
in which the code of tick doc
is being programmed by chinese
programmers
and somehow we feel safe because
oracle also has a piece of the business
i need to hear details but nothing i've
heard so far
suggests that would solve any problems
but
obviously the the magic is in the
details
so i'll give you an update on my ongoing
attempt
to de-program one i call him my
my smartest uh anti-trump democrat
friend because he's legitimately very
smart but he has tds like you've never
seen
and one one of the things i told you
about was that he believes that trump's
campaign ads are lies
and the biden campaign ads are not
and this is this is a sophisticated
very well informed person who cares
about politics and follows it
and actually believed that the biden
campaign ads were pretty straight
and the trump ones were lies now
i don't know what world you live in
where you think that any campaign ad
is true if you think anybody is putting
out true campaign ads
you should just stop right there because
you should never
you shouldn't even vote i mean
literally you should just say oh if i
believe the campaign ads
i probably shouldn't even vote i'm
pretty gullible because they're not even
designed to be true
nobody starts with it nobody starts with
the goal of
all right let's put some truth in this
ad
said nobody because the truth simply
doesn't work as well
as a you know a let's say a managed
truth so i said to
my friend who thinks that biden doesn't
lie
a link to fact factcheck.org and
and the biden part of it so you can see
an entire
list where you know smart people who
know
what's going on have fact checked his
claims as false
now here's the thing my smart friend's
initial when we first started talking
about biden
his initial claim was that biden
was not a gigantic liar like president
trump and
and that alone that alone
tells the whole story yeah you could get
into other issues the
other things he look he wants but that
number one thing
was that you can't have a liar as a
president and then i send them
really convincing proof because every
every
every lie from biden is explained and
the source is shown so you can see
that he's massively lied
what happens to somebody who said that
was their number one reason for voting
for him
is that he didn't do the thing which is
so clearly documented he does
a lot of doesn't change anything
and you know a few years ago when i
started telling you the facts don't
matter
i think you probably thought that was an
exaggeration
and until you see enough examples where
facts
literally don't matter they don't have
any they don't have any impact at all
uh it's hard to believe all right
there's a story that iran is a i guess
from politico or something
that iran is allegedly mulling over an
attempt to assassinate the united states
ambassador to south africa
and this would be some kind of
retaliation for
our droning of solomon a
and here's my here's my reaction to that
number one it's anonymous
anonymous sources so is it should you
believe it
if that's the only thing you know is
that this story exists
and the sources are unnamed because
they're anonymous what credibility
should you put on this
i'd recommend zero zero credibility
would be the amount right amount
and again that doesn't mean it's not
true
credibility is different from whether
it's true or false
credible means is this a source that you
should
believe to be true and the answer is no
not even close
you should not believe it's true but
suppose this let's talk about it
what would be iran's point of taking out
an ambassador to south africa
what and and how would that be in any
way equal
to us taking out the the most important
strategic
asset in iran was the general and they
would take out
our ambassador to south africa
now i get that we'd be unhappy about it
and maybe it would look like oh
we're you can't take advantage of us
we'll we'll attack you back
and i get that but wouldn't we attack
them if they did that
i mean wouldn't we have to respond i'm
trying to understand
how iran could possibly command ahead
with this plan can does your brain come
up with any reason
that this would work for iran now i
don't doubt
that they mold it because a lot of
things get mulled over
in fact trump gets in trouble all the
time
for mulling things behind closed doors
and then when it gets reported
you say my god what a bad idea but
that's not the way you should look at it
the way you should look at it is that
lots of bad ideas get mold
and then rejected if you heard one of
the mold and rejected ideas
as if it were more serious than it was
behind closed doors
you would come away with the wrong idea
so maybe they're mulling it
but i don't find it credible actually
um the university of
edinburgh they've renamed what was the
david hume tower i guess david hume
might have had some
issues might have been racist i don't
know but
they've named it after george floyd
so the university of edinburgh is
honoring george floyd
who may or may not have died of a
fentanyl overdose resisting
arrest and had a criminal record and i
thought to myself
well if people if people are happy with
that
i i'm generally in favor of letting
people have what they want
if it doesn't hurt me personally would
you agree with that
if somebody wants something and it
doesn't hurt you
it doesn't hurt anybody else why not
so if the university of edinburgh and
the
you know the administration and the
students are happy with naming their
building after george floyd
i don't have any problem with that
because that's what they want to do
and it doesn't make me unhappy doesn't
have any effect on me at all so i'm cool
with that
but i thought why not do more of that
and so i suggested by tweet this morning
that maybe we should replace all of the
confederate statues
and any of the statues of slave owners
with
with statues of citizens
who had criminal records and that died
while resisting arrest
sort of the the george floyd model
anybody who died while
resisting arrest and had also a criminal
record
will just replace all the confederate
statues with
those citizens now again
just like just like the edinburgh
thing if people are happy with it
i say why not now
oh some people think that's a bad idea
i'm being corrected that the
pronunciation of edinburgh
is edinburgh burra edinburgh
so everything i said about edinburgh you
can change that to edinburgh
if that's right who knows yeah other
people are saying is edinburgh
all right let's call it edinburgh
even though it's looks like edinburgh
all right
and here's the thinking behind that
what what is the rational way that we're
dealing with the
the riots and the unhappiness and the
police killing of
black citizens what are what are the
actual rational things we're doing to
fix that
um none right correct me if i'm wrong
there are no rational plans you know
defunding the police isn't really a plan
because even if you imagine that it's
just changing resources to something
else
you've got to see the details um
so in the in the case where all there
are no
rational plans that look like they would
work what do you do
if you don't have any rational plans
if you're in a situation where all of
the things that you could possibly do to
get out of your bad situation
are all crazy what do you do
if they're all crazy well i would
recommend
the mr spock technique
if you remember from star trek commander
spock
was once i think he was granted in space
and
his ship was losing power and he was
going to die pretty soon
and he did something to cause an
explosion to blow up the remaining
amount of his
oxygen i think and so he only had a
little bit left
but he got lucky somebody saw the
explosion and saved him
and when he was asked about that and
they said um
blowing up all of your oxygen when you
don't have much oxygen
isn't that like the craziest thing you
could do and spock
i'm paraphrasing because i might
remember some of this wrong if anybody
wants to
correct me later in the in the comments
and then spock's comment was
paraphrasing that once you've used up or
or once you've run out of rational paths
but you have to do something all that's
left is
irrational paths so you have to do
something so you take an irrational one
and just hope you get lucky
and that's what he did and he got lucky
so the the logic of it
says that sometimes if all the rational
paths are either unavailable or there's
a problem
you've got to take an irrational path
now
when i say we should build statues to
people with criminal records who died
while resisting rest
what is your first take on that that's
irrational
it's irrational to build a statue to
honor somebody who's
you know died in such circumstances
but a lot of people want to honor these
very people suppose you just agreed with
them
what would happen this is actually a
persuasion technique
that i'm getting to the persuasion
technique is if somebody's asking for
something
that seems irrational instead of
debating it and saying no you don't want
that no that's a bad idea
if you've tried that and it didn't work
and all it did was harden their
resistance you can sometimes try the
spock effect
which is to go the irrational direction
which is
to amplify it if somebody has a bad idea
and you can't convince them it's bad
embrace it
and amplify it and they will talk
themselves out of it
because if you just imagine this this
will never happen by the way but it's
it's fun to understand how persuasion
works
if i were in charge of the you know
country and i could do anything i wanted
you know i could get a law passed
through congress i would
actually literally really no kidding
authorize a law to replace confederate
statues with statues of citizens
who had criminal records and and died in
police
resisting rest what would happen
well some people would say that's a good
idea
and the other people would say um
i'm not sure i want that and they would
talk themselves out of it
so you want to create a situation where
people can talk themselves out of it
because they're not going to listen to
you
you're the other team you know they just
have an automatic reflex
to not like what you said so agree and
amplify
when it's all you have if it's your only
option
that's the way i would go literally i
would do that if i were in charge
um i made a comment
i guess yesterday on periscope that
google
was it looked like they were filtering
things in favor of
biden over trump but uh andres backhouse
noted that if you put in trump
and the the beginning of the story is
that if you try to search for
does biden have dementia the non-google
search engines will autofill that
question because it says so often
we'll autofill it right away but google
will never autofill it you have to type
out the entire word
you know then then it'll do the search
and so i pointed out that that seemed
like an obvious thumb on the scales of
the election
but andre's pointed out that they may
just be suppressing
anything that's let's say a little
extreme
and maybe a little unproven about either
candidate
so for example if you do a search on
trump
it doesn't autofill with anything about
racism but you think maybe it would
right because there might be enough
democrats searching for that stuff
then maybe you would so there's some
thought
that they might be just trying to
suppress things that are
not true as far as they're concerned
so they might say to themselves it's not
true that trump is
a racist it's only true he's being
accused
while at the same time they might say
it's not true
at least proven that biden
has dementia is just something that
people accuse him of
so if they were treating those as
similar you'd say
all right okay that's both cases
they de-emphasize something that doesn't
have you know
valid evidence for it but
would that be an absence of
election interference nope because you
can't make that kind of a change
without affecting the election it can't
be done
let me give you an example let's say
with my example of
searching for trump is trump a racist
versus
does biden have dementia let's say
everybody in the country had already
made up their mind
about trump and racism they'd already
made up their mind
so no matter what you searched for it
wasn't going to change your mind
but let's say that the biden dementia
question
was sort of fresher in other words there
were people who legitimately wanted to
search it
and find out what the argument is who
are not yet exposed to it
that's very different if you stop both
of them one of them is a mature argument
one of them is fresh that's not equal
now even if your intentions are just to
give the best information
and maybe google has those intentions
it's possible
but you couldn't do it so if you don't
let the
algorithm just do what the algorithm
does you're putting your finger on the
scale
and it's definitely affecting something
it may not be affecting it the way you
want it
but it's affecting something so
i thought to myself i wonder if there
are cleaner examples
of this search autofill thing
so i did a search on the three on three
big search engines uh
bing duckduckgo and google and i tried
to google
find people hoax and
how long did it take for autofill
to fill in the hoax part well on
duckduckgo
pretty quickly you just start typing in
find peep
and hoax and you get a whole page of
hoaxes
and my my debunking of the hoax is
actually the top result
you go to bing it fills it in autofills
it
shows your whole page of the pokes being
debunked
you go to google never never autofills
it
it doesn't autofill it at all and
it gives different search results so if
you do
if you do a duckduckgo or bing you'll
get
pretty much i mean this may not be 100
true
but you get mostly the debunks because
you searched
for hoax doesn't that make sense if you
search for something with the word hoax
in it
it would probably give you the debunks
that prove it's a hoax
not google google shows you
sort of a mix of people saying the hoax
is a hoax
and people saying that the debunk of the
hoax is
the hoax so google actually tries to
balance it
like maybe the hoax is true
that is not even close
to being an appropriate way to handle
that question
so two out of three search engines give
you something useful
and google google does not
so i i reject the idea that they're just
trying to be good citizens
and to prevent you from seeing things
that maybe aren't that uh
validated or credible but
so then then you do a search
on uh i think if you just do a search on
trump
or biden and you see what news sources
come up
if you look on some you'll get you know
fox news maybe breitbart
if you go on google it's nothing but
enemies of the president that come up
first
so the first three searches are business
insider
a bezos property washington post a bezos
property
cnn those are the top three results when
you search for trump
i think if i remember right but not on
the other search engines they'll give
you
like a better mix of pro and con
all right um i would say that
ai already
already controls humans
so if you're wondering oh i
i hope we don't get to that point where
the ai is
determining you know how civilization
runs
we're past that we're well past that
because i don't believe there's any
single individual who knows exactly what
the algorithms do
there are definitely individuals who
might be able to tweak it to get a
certain result in a specific case
but i don't think there's anybody who
understands the
entirety of the algorithm and how it
acts
i think the algorithm is effectively
making its own decisions
because it's doing things you don't
anticipate
and you're just getting a result it's
for all practical purposes
ai already is running the show and
you might say to yourself but scott
humans could reprogram it
they could just turn it off they could
delete the program
so really really it's the humans because
if the humans were not getting the
results they wanted
they would just turn it off or they
would reprogram it so
logically the humans are still in charge
wrong completely wrong if you believe
that model that the humans are in charge
because they
can reprogram the ai then you don't
understand what the ai is doing
they the ai was built to be
indispensable
the way it is if they reprogrammed it
their profits would go down and and
you know companies are hooked on profits
so
the ai knows how to addict
humans to control them
let's say a a heroin addict
does a heroin addict have the option of
not doing heroin
if if you hand them heroin here's some
heroin
and you're a heroin addict and you're
jonesing for your next fix
technically technically speaking
does the addict have free will and they
can just decide ah
you know maybe not i think i will not
take that heroin
even though i'm an addict and even
though i'm going into withdrawal
and even though there's no police here
nothing to stop me
it doesn't happen ever
the addict takes the heroin in that
situation
so if you think that the addict has
something that you think is free will
and therefore is in charge of this
process you don't understand how people
work
the the person is controlled by the drug
the drugs in charge
the drug makes the decision and it made
the decision that this guy is going to
do some more heroin
in effect the ai does the same thing it
addicts
the creators they're addicted to the
money
the the reward the promotions and then
the people use it
you know the customers so to speak
they're addicted in a different way
but no there's no free will free will
has
already been removed if it ever existed
free will has been removed from
civilization
for the big stuff we are now already
responding just to addiction and the
addiction is coming through the
the ai all right
and if you were to predict the long run
uh
like where it all goes this is different
than most situations because in most
situations
the adam's law of slow moving disasters
would kick in
and the adam's law of slow moving
disasters says for those of you
who might be new to it that if we can
see a problem developing from you know
years in advance we we always fix it
so it looked like we wouldn't have
enough food in the future but we figured
out how to
grow more food it looked like we'd run
out of fossil fuels
but we figured out how to frack and on
and on and on if we can see it coming
we're pretty darn good ozone there's a
hole in the ozone
we got time we fixed it year 2000
bug in the computers we didn't have much
time
but we had enough so if you got time you
can fix it
this is an exception
you can't fix the complete takeover by
artificial intelligence just because you
see it coming
for years in advance which we have we've
seen this coming forever
and the reason is that the humans
are not in charge of decisions
with the year 2000 bug the human said
hey we don't like that bug
we better get together and do something
about it so humans could make a decision
then they could act on it with fossil
fuels
humans could say hey it looks like we're
not gonna have enough fuel
let's do something about it and fracking
is one of the things that came out of it
but with ai the humans can say
hey there's a problem
and they can't work on it because the ai
won't let them
the ai controls their thoughts it
controls their priorities
it controls what they think is important
so even if we humans said hey that's a
problem we better work on it
the ai would talk you out of it
already that's not the future that's
that's already the past you were already
at the point where the ai
will change your mind so effectively
that you cannot independently decide to
rewrite the ai
the ai already programs us by its design
in the in the beginning the very let's
say the first ones
i'll use a phrase from babylon 5.
the first ones the programmers who
initially came up with the ideas
for how to create algorithms that and
services that addict you they had free
will
and had they chosen to do something
different
we wouldn't be here but they did they
built a system
that now controls them and also controls
us
once it's built humans don't have the
ability to unbuild it
we don't have the ability to work
against our addiction any better than
the
heroin addict who's having withdrawal
and you're handling handing them some
heroin
all right what is the real story of
coved testing in the united states it
feels like the
election might come down to do you
believe that trump did or did not do the
right things
in testing and handling coronavirus in
general
but when they talk about the president's
uh what he did or did not do
it usually comes down to testing doesn't
it you know there'll be some other
criticisms
but mostly if you had to pick one thing
that people will really focus on
mostly it's the thought that if he'd
done more aggressive testing early
we could be like taiwan that sort of
tested its way out of it
is that reasonable sorry is that
reasonable
here's my problem with this why don't i
know
the following question i tweeted this to
see if anybody else could help me
was there ever a time this year after we
knew the coronavirus was a problem
was there ever a time where in which
these three conditions
were met at the same time because this
is the only way we could have tested our
way out of it
is if all three conditions were ever
true at the same time
and i don't know the answer so i'm
asking you
were these three conditions all
simultaneously ever
true at the same time number one we had
the right
kind and quantity of test kits
to to test for contact tracing so that's
the first condition
did we have enough of them to do what we
needed to do
and they worked in the early stages at
the same time
was it before there were too many
infections because i believe it's true
that if if you have a massive infection
in your country
they're trying to do contact tracing
basically just doesn't work
because the numbers don't work it's
growing faster than you can contact
trace
but if you had like three three
three people who have it maybe like
taiwan or new zealand then maybe then
yes
contact tracing is just what you need
so so has that been true and at the same
time
trump ignoring the experts so was there
ever
these three things that we had the tests
and we had plenty of them
that the number of infections were low
so low that the testing could get on top
of it
and also that the experts that trump
had advising him were saying hey hey
get on top of this with these tests i
believe
we've never had those three conditions
if those three conditions
never existed is it trump's fault that
we didn't do enough testing
because could he do enough testing if
his experts didn't tell him to
because we didn't want him to do
something that the experts didn't advise
could he have done it if they didn't
have the tests
they just didn't exist or they didn't
work could he have done that testing
if by the time you know we knew about it
there were so many infections that
didn't make any difference you couldn't
test anyway
so why is it that i'm sitting here
in september and i don't know the answer
to this question
that should alarm you because you think
you're reading the news
but all you're reading is the
left-leaning news
saying um we're not going to give you
the details but he sure botched
the testing and then i say to myself
botch did exactly how what was the thing
he could have done
could have done that was actually
possible that he was advised to do
that he didn't do and i'm like well okay
if the people on the left won't give me
the details they're just going to say it
was all botched
at least i can get the rest of the
details from the right
so you go to the right and say did the
president botch testing
and they'll say some dumb ass thing like
no there was plenty of testing
for people who had symptoms
it's not even the same topic
right so i'm thinking okay i can't get
the story from the left
because they're only going to say it's
botched and give me no details
and i can't get the full story from the
right because they won't even talk about
the same topic
how do you get the news anymore honest
question
there's no hyperbole in this how do
people get
news in this situation
the single most important thing i need
to know to vote
in the biggest election this country has
ever had i would say
the most important fact completely
discoverable
meaning it wouldn't it wouldn't be a lot
of work
for a reported to say oh let me answer
those questions for you
yeah what were the experts telling trump
and could he have done it was it
possible
that story isn't out there remember i
said that you're already being
manipulated by the algorithm
if the algorithm were not already
running
the country you would know the answer to
this question
because people who were just reporters
and wanted to write
stories that people would find
interesting and read and meaningful
those reporters would say huh that's
exactly the story the public needs to
see
i guess i'll go write that story never
happened why because nobody gets paid
for that story
the algorithm pays you to write the
story that says it was botched
and the algorithm will pay you on the
other side to say
it was all brilliant and everything went
well
there's no the algorithm doesn't have a
payday
for somebody who tells useful
information to the public
we don't have that it just doesn't exist
so
and i i'll bet you'll never see that
actually
uh here's case in point so chris wallace
was talking to a biden advisor
and was challenging him on this
so chris wallace asked the question very
clearly
he said you know why did biden take
until april
to agree with the travel ban if the
travel ban was put on
at the end of january what happened
between the end of january and
april before biden said that the travel
ban was a good idea
why did it take so long good question
right
and his assistant answers the question
of why it took so long
by saying well you have to understand
the virus was already in the country
that's not even the same question so in
other words
you can't even get a simple answer to a
question
why did it take so long you can't get
any information
about testing banning we we're in
complete darkness we the citizens
in complete darkness about whether our
government did a good or bad job
we don't know oh we think we know
we're positive we know because the
algorithm told us
what to think it told some of us to
think he botched it
meaning trump and told other people to
think he didn't
and that's what we think that's what the
algorithm told us to think
all right um
what and so fried zakaria
who's who shall i really recommend uh
fareed can be a little
tds at times you know a little
anti-trump
but you know if you're being objective
he puts on a good product
you know if i can just talk about the
the quality of the topics and the guests
and just
the job fareed does he's just really
good i've always
appreciated his show even sometimes if i
don't you know
like the bias on but he had on uh
i think it was the was it the president
of taiwan who coincidentally
seemed to be an epidemiologist i don't
know if it was a president or one of the
one of the top executives but it doesn't
matter for this point
and fareed was asking him how they were
so
successful in taiwan and others were not
and this is what this the leader of
taiwan said that one of the things they
did is
very aggressive testing and contact
tracing so here's my first question
is there something that taiwan could do
in those early days because they had the
right kind of tests
that we couldn't do i don't know the
answer to that question
and it didn't come out of this did they
have the right kind of tests and we had
the wrong kind
did they have the right number of them
and we had the wrong kind was it that
when they had a few tests or a few cases
they got on it quickly was that what
made the difference but here's the part
that doesn't get emphasized in order to
make the taiwan
thing worked you basically went to jail
if you had symptoms now when i say
jail
i just got a glitch on my computer a low
battery message
so that might glitch for some of you
when we talk about the success of taiwan
and how good they did and then we say
well why can't we be like taiwan
taiwan put you in jail for two weeks if
you had symptoms
and when i say jail i mean a room with i
don't know a television and wi-fi
and a bed so it wasn't technically a
jail
but you couldn't leave so what do you
call it if you can't leave
if you can't leave it's a jail
because if you tried to leave they'd put
you in the real jail i think
um so is there any scenario
in which the citizens of the united
states would have put up with
oh you had a cough so i guess you're
going to be in jail for two weeks
i don't think so i don't think so
so um
anytime we anytime you see anybody
compare
what happened in the united states to
any other country
it is a lie it's either an intentional
lie
because they do know how to compare
things and they're choosing to do it
incorrectly
or they don't know how to compare things
because if you didn't know how to
compare things you'd say
what are they doing with vitamin d how
many african americans or how many black
people live in those countries because
they have greater comorbidity
what is the obesity rate in those other
countries when did they start how many
international
you know airports do they have you know
when did they find their first thing
did they have tests that work were they
prepared if you don't
if you don't compare countries on all of
those gigantic variables
you're not really comparing anything
you're just being an advocate
all right and then the other thing of
course is you don't know if those other
countries are going to have
you know new symptoms etc now we talked
about this
like i think last week that there was a
apparently a high quality study
that showed that the vitamin d the the
the hospital grade vitamin d not the
stuff you get in your
your health store but the the hospital
grade vitamin d
basically eliminated icu
visits so it was a smallish test
but it was big enough to make me think
uh have we already beaten this thing
because imagine if you got the same
result as the tested
for 50 people of which many of them
would have been in the icu
it was almost none almost none
so now that we know that and we know
correct me if i'm wrong i saw dr drew
join here so i know there's at least one
person who knows the answer to this
question
if you simply gave everybody who had
coronavirus
symptoms covet symptoms if you just gave
them
all vitamin d you know the hospital
grade
vitamin d the the name brand stuff
would anybody have a bad outcome
and aren't we already doing it you know
in other words
the risk reward of the vitamin d now
that we have a high quality study saying
it's amazing
don't we know that it also pretty much
couldn't hurt you
so that's the the part i have the
question on
because i think we're already past i
think we're done
right because if that one test was
really meaningful and
you know didn't have any errors in the
test so we really know that the vitamin
d just
kicks kicks this virus in the
gonads we should be massively rolling
this out everywhere
just because the doctors would have seen
the reports too
they probably would take the death count
down to trivial and shouldn't that be
done by
the end of this week let me let me be as
stark as possible
if it's true that the vitamin d given to
you in the hospital
doesn't have a downside and we have
enough of it
and it's true that it works according to
this latest high quality study
aren't we one week away from just
being done because if you took it from
a hundred percent problem that it is now
to two percent
of that problem in terms of death rate
we're kind of done are we
am i wrong we're kind of done so
i don't know what's going to happen to
the stock market
but i feel like when we start getting
our stats
let's let's give it two weeks just to
have some time
unless you hear there's a shortage of
that vitamin d the the good stuff they
use in the hospitals
unless you hear there's a shortage of it
or you hear that they're not using it
for some reason that i can't
that i haven't heard of um we might be
two weeks away from effectively the end
of it
because i think in two weeks if you
don't see the
the death count in the united states
drop to
trivial levels then probably the vitamin
d wasn't everything that the test said
it was
we'll find out but just think about that
we could be two weeks away am i
am i being over optimistic because if
that vitamin d thing is real
two weeks right all right
those are the things i would like to
leave you with
ai is your biggest problem maybe you'll
never know
maybe you'll just go on with your life
thinking that you're making your own
decisions but you're not
and maybe that's just as good as
whatever you were doing before
i see in the comments somebody's saying
that fauci endorses
vitamin d um remember
who else uh oh
is the stock market up today let me just
take a look
before i get off here the fouchy well it
is
well there we go bitcoins up apple's up
oh hello everything's up
looking good tesla
somebody says joe rogan is hosting a
debate
is that an idea that you're suggesting
or is that some kind of news
if if joe rogan hosted a debate
it would be a pretty good debate
although i would recommend
myself can you imagine a debate
that i moder that i moderated
it would be pretty darn good if i do say
so
myself um anyway dr fauci does recommend
vitamin d
but there are two separate things one is
that everybody should have enough
vitamin d just in general
because it's good for your health it's
good for every kind of thing
so yes dr fauci has is is on record
with basically every other medical
professional in the world
plus one cartoonist plus most of you
who said from day one of this virus
those of you who have been with me since
the beginning
you know that the moment this virus
looked like it was
coming at us i told you guess some sun
get some vitamin d
get your you know get your health up do
everything you can just to
you know get your immune system up and
vitamin d was a big part of that
so the fact that fauci says vitamin d is
good
in general is a little bit of a
different topic
than the question of giving people
massive amounts to
prevent icu of the hospital grade
vitamin d that's different than
the health store stuff um
so you can say you said it well yeah but
it's a difference
in the extent
all right um see trump tweeted
rogan didn't all right
apparently this is going to be good
enough that it's worth waiting for
so let's see trump trump trump
trump let's see what he said
about rogan i see him he's dumping on
drudge
oh 51 approval rating in rasmussen
looking good uh
i don't see
anything about don't see anything
yet how many tweets did he do this
morning
he's been tweeting like crazy
all right i don't see it so somebody
said there was a
joe rogan debate related story i guess
i'll have to look it up
but i don't see it right now
uh it wasn't proposed by rogan but he
did accept
uh oh joe rogan wanted a four-hour
debate
he will moderate and trump retweeted all
right i'll take a look at that
um don't you think i should still do an
interview with the
president trump and maybe one with biden
they would never
they would never let me interview biden
but
president trump is going to be i think
in my neighborhood
today actually yeah so if anybody's
watching from
the trump campaign the best interview
president trump could ever do
would be with me because i'll ask some
questions that
haven't been asked before and you'll you
really get a good idea what's going on
if
if if i did that interview so that's all
i have for now and let's uh enjoy the
week it's going to be
off the hook
