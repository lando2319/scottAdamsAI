foreign
well hello everybody
guess what
it's time
it's time
for the best part of your whole day now
I'm not saying the rest of your day will
be
not good it might be awesome but no
matter how awesome it is
no matter how awesome
yes this will be the highlight and are
you wondering if
this sort of thing can improve your
antibodies well according to a thing
called science yes a lot
you've heard of a thing called placebos
right
that's right the placebo Works quite
often not as well as the drug it's
compared to if you do things right
but
placebo's work so what does that tell
you about the ability of your mind to
influence your health outcomes
pretty good pretty good unless it's just
a statistical data problem but I think
there's something happening there
secondly we know for sure that if you're
more relaxed and less stressed
you'll produce less
if you're more relaxed you'll produce
less cortisol the stress chemical and
the stress chemical makes your
immunity to everything go down
so yes
100 percent guaranteed
the people watching this live stream
will be healthier than other people
because you have the benefit of all this
relaxing content things that take the
edge off things that make you feel
better things that make you feel smarter
more capable more confident you put all
that together what's that do to your
antibodies I think you know I think you
know
well there was a recent study that
showed that zero people
watching my live stream have died of
covet
I don't think that's a coincidence do
you no how would you like to take it up
a notch I know you would how about a how
about all you need is a cup of glass a
tanker Charles is a canteen jugular
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
I like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure
the dopamine to the day the thing that
makes your antibodies line up and sing
It's called The simultaneous Sip and
it's happening now go
you know you can never tell when I'm
completely serious can you
but I would bet a large amount of money
that the people who watch this live
stream have better outcomes than people
who don't
I would bet on that
do you remember during the height of the
pandemic when
the public was scared to death
but many of you joined me then and we're
we're watching my content and when
people were saying the wheels are coming
off everything's falling apart and I
said no not so much you'll be fine
you'll be fine and here's why
don't you think you had less cortisol
than other people
I think so because Actually I don't even
know anybody else who was making uh
chill out content at the time
probably just me I mean if you could
think of somebody let me know but it's
real it's real people you get healthier
when you watch this well let's talk
about all the things that are happening
shall we
Rasmussen has a poll about uh Dr fauci
and found that 46 percent of the likely
voters polled uh want fauci to be forced
to resign 46 is that good or is that bad
anybody anybody
is that good or bad for Dr fauci 46
percent of them want you to resign
46 is the percent
that we want everybody to
basically that's a universal number
40 of the country wants every famous
person who works for the government to
resign
how many people want AOC to resign or be
forced to resign about 46 percent
how many people think the President
should be forced to resign I mean there
are more people who dislike it maybe but
how many think he should be forced to
resign yeah about 46 percent
you know I I read this I think to myself
after all the trouble
the fauci has gotten into and gotten out
of and gotten into again all the
criticism
the number of people who want him to be
fired is about the same as everybody
else
apparently we are completely immune to
any kind of data or analysis but boy do
we like being on a team we like being on
a team
so 46 percent is pretty much like the
universal
number of people who want somebody else
to resign somebody famous
all right
I don't know why that's funny but I'm
going to read that comment in the
comments on YouTube 47 of people pulled
think Alec Baldwin is actually a cowboy
that's not that's not far off
in my my uh current final answer on Alec
Baldwin
and I like to say this because I would
consider him a political opponent
adversary you know I don't like to use
those words because we're all in the
same team America but he would be on the
other side politically from
whoops
okay
what the hell is happening over here
we've got some kind of unstable internet
connection messing up my locals feed
that's interesting but only one of them
I've had two feeds
uh
I've had two feeds I'm going to turn
another one on let's see if I can
cause this to work
technical problem being worked out oh
permission denied oh
that's interesting
um
well let's see if I can reconnect this
might be a way to do it hold on YouTube
people hold on
oh for some reason it looks like it's
working now interesting
let's try this damn Rumble so somebody's
blaming Rumble all right there we're
back
wasn't such a problem after all
right uh I was in the middle of saying
something so fascinating that I can't
even remember it
does anybody else remember what I was
saying before I got sidetracked anything
anything
all right
uh but anyway hypnosis and antibodies
it's real
um
what was I talking about uh
tell me oh Eric Alec Baldwin
I guess that didn't matter
all right I think locals is back right I
think locals is back working it looks
like it is
um
I've decided that Joe Biden is what I
call the stem cell president the stem
cell president you're gonna like this if
you didn't see me say it on Twitter
you're gonna like it you ready
what is the process of the United States
for replacing a vice president not a
president but a vice president
what's the process if let's say a vice
president were to resign
or to be I don't know impeached or maybe
have a medical problem have to leave
what would be the process
well it turns out that Biden would
appoint somebody
and then Congress would vote by a simple
majority
now now we're not talking about line of
succession
so it has nothing to do with Pelosi
Pelosi is who would take over if the
first and second command were
incapacitated at the same time
we're not talking about that so forget
about line of succession that's that's
not the conversation we're talking about
how to replace a vice president just a
vice president
so vice president quits let's say and
the president simply nominates another
Democrat in this case and then because
Democrats have a majority and also
because historically the country likes
to have a vice president you know we we
don't like to go without a vice
president
so as long as as long as the president
nominates somebody who's not
horrible you know somebody who's an
ordinary person within that party
generally you can expect to get a quick
agreement
you know maybe even from some
Republicans who just are in favor of the
idea of you know good continuity and and
keeping tradition
so
here's our situation it looks like maybe
even the people on Biden's team didn't
really ever expect him to go four years
can we all agree on that
maybe they didn't know one way or the
other but they certainly weren't
confident he could make all four years
would you give me that that they weren't
confident about it
they might have been optimistic but you
couldn't be confident about it which
means that Kamala Harris was always the
backup plan
that's what the vice president is not
not really a shocking statement there
but I think they were surprised at how
poorly she performs
I was I I picked her to be the nominee
and I was shocked that as soon as you
took her out of a let's say a
well-defined situation where she's you
know grilling people in Congress like a
lawyer where she's quite good actually
uh or a debate she wasn't too bad in the
debates but you put her in any kind of a
free-forum situation it's just she just
falls apart and I think the Democrats
can see it too
she seems to be de-emphasized at the
moment
so
uh yes I was I was wrong about uh her
being chosen as the top of the ticket
that is correct I might not be wrong
about the plan to put her in power we'll
see about that but let's say this is
just speculative
let's say that the Democrats who are
really pulling the power strings behind
the scenes
they say to themselves we can put
anybody in the presidency we want now
because they can
all they have to do is find a reason for
Kamala Harris to resign
before Biden does
you see this play
Biden just has to pick anybody who can
get through Congress and that's a pretty
big probably a pretty big menu of people
he could get approved
you know I don't think he could get you
know AOC or you know one of the one of
the squad approved maybe not that but he
could get an ordinary Democrat approved
pretty easily
and
effectively the Democrats can pick
anybody they want for president for now
right now I'm not wrong about any of
this am I
give me a fact check uh can a PR can a
vice president resign yes
is the process to replace them that the
president picked somebody new and
Congress approves by a simple majority
that's important they don't need
two-thirds just a simple majority and
they have that
it
and is Biden likely to make it four
years probably not I don't even think
his own team assumes that
so we've created a situation where he's
the stem cell president he can be turned
into any president they want who's also
a normal Democrat or yeah normal
Democrat
how many people have ever thought of
that before
this play is right here it's right in
front of you
if you see if you see any moves
for uh
or Kamala Harris to leave the job
you don't know who your next president
is going to be but it won't be based on
Democracy that's for sure
all right
um
so that's interesting
there's a story about Reed Hoffman
billionaire founder of LinkedIn and he
was he was one of the PayPal Mafia
people
meaning one of the startup people on
PayPal
uh before LinkedIn and Reid Hoffman
teamed up with George Soros you've heard
of him right anybody anybody George
service another billionaire
and they're creating the media firm to
quote combat disinformation
wow
that's right
two billionaires are teaming up
to tell us what's true and what isn't
do you see any potential problems there
does any see anybody see any potential
problem
that looks good right hey billionaire is
trying to help us with information yes
it's nice that they're going to help us
understand what's true
because I don't know if you knew this
but you don't know
and they do or the people they hire will
do and interestingly although apparently
nobody in the world can figure out
what's true
these two billionaires have figured out
how to get some people who do know
apparently there are people who can tell
what's true and they haven't been
telling us
I hate those people
think about it
there are people who know what's true
and they haven't been telling us
why don't the people who know what's
true tell us what's true instead of all
the Liars well
hopefully Reid Hoffman and George Soros
will solve that problem
by getting some totally credible people
that I'm sure you will believe to tell
you what's true and what is it all right
it's called good information Inc
and they're going to fund and scale
businesses
they quote cut through the echo Chambers
with fact-based information fact-based
no more of this opinion crap no more of
this conspiracy theory crap we're going
for fact-based information now
it even plans to invest in local news
companies
uh do you see any red flags there
billionaires owning the news
huh well there's a billionaire that owns
the New York Times and it's not like
they're producing any fake new what they
are
the New York Times produces fake news
and it's owned by a billionaire
well that's weird but at least we have
the Washington Post because I put what
The Washington Post prints fake news and
it's owned by a billionaire how could
that be how could that be
because billionaires don't give you bad
information
that's that's not what they do do they
so
um
here's a
here's an example of why you should
trust this entity yeah at first I was
worried
that maybe they they would be biased
themselves
please check out Rogan's podcast with
Jewel she doesn't use these words it's
all about Talent Stacks how interesting
so there's a Joe Rogan interview with
Jewel that
um
looks interesting in terms of
understanding your systems for success
to my point
um
so one of the people who's going to run
this new good information and points out
that they're not going to be all just
left-wing stuff
it's not going to be a bunch of just
left-wing stuff don't worry don't worry
and one of the examples given of their
effect based information process is she
points to the bulwark have you heard of
it it's a publication online the bulwark
as a center-right news site founded in
opposition to trumpism as an example of
the type of center-right news Outlet it
could fund
so just an example they haven't funded
it but they could fund something like
the bulwark
have you ever heard of the bulwark
if any of you seen an article from the
bulwark
because I have
do you know which articles I've seen
from the Bork
not a true one yet
not not a true one because the only time
anybody sends me to read an article is
when they have fake news
which has been often enough that the
only news I've ever read in the bulwark
was obviously untrue
like I'm talking about the obvious
hoaxes you know the Trump called you
know neo-nazis find people hoax you know
that sort of hoax
the ones that you know are fake just by
looking at I was like that's not true
that's what the bulwark is I if you
would if you said to me uh name a bunch
of fake news entities from this list I
would have picked them out immediately
as one of the fake news sources
so literally a famous fake news source
this anti-rite is their example of how
they won't be biased because they'll
pick a fake news source that says
they're on the right but also criticizes
the right with fake news
so don't worry they've got this bias
thing taken care of
why should you be worried
that Reid Hoffman is part of this
anybody
let's see how uh how informed you are
about your billionaires so this would be
sort of a trivia question but useful
right yeah so Reid Hoffman founded
LinkedIn that's that's a fact but that's
not directly related to my point that
I'm going to make why should you be
worried
specifically that Reed Hoffman is
involved
what do we know about him besides
billionaire founder of LinkedIn
uh
he knows how to get things done
that's good yeah he's very effective we
know that connected effective
very smart I don't know if you know how
smart read Hoffman is but whatever
whatever you think is the smartest
person you know
he's in that category
uh somebody says his ethnicity no that's
not what we're going for
uh that's not what we're going for
here's what I know about Reed Hoffman
he understands persuasion
a lot of what you see in the stickiness
of social media
was invented by Reed Hoffman
uh I forget what process it was
specifically but I think he was behind
the idea that made things Network sticky
you know they're recommending your
friends I think he was behind
the technology that seems obvious now
right isn't this the most obvious thing
if you're using an application that says
you know why don't you invite your
friends
I think he invented that
and uh I would offer
that he probably knows more about
psychology and persuasion than any of
the billionaires I'm not positive about
that
you know Elon Musk is up there too Elon
Musk was on the PayPal Mafia with Reed
Hoffman so by the way Reid Hoffman and
Elon Musk their first startup well one
of their their first successful startup
I guess the big one PayPal was together
Reid Hoffman isn't like other people
he has a deeper understanding of uh by
the way I've
um I've met him and talked with him
briefly so so I have you know tiny
amount of interaction with him
personally
but even in a tiny interaction you talk
to him for five minutes and you know
you're not talking to a regular person
you're talking to somebody who's
operating at a really high level sort of
yeah Peter teal level yeah Peter Thiel
also from the PayPal Mafia so we're
talking about people who are
extra extra smart and he's he's fairly
anti-trump right he's extra smart but
he's smart in a uh persuasion
brainwashing kind of way the difference
between persuasion and brainwashing of
course is just your intention
if your intention is positive then it's
just called School
and if your attention is a bad it's
called brainwashing so we don't know
what his intentions are but he is
anti-trump
so one would have to you know make an
assumption which we can't verify but
make an assumption that it's
sort of a a tool to work against
trumpism so to speak
and he would be one of the best
brainwashers of all time
you worried
this would be the uh
the first time I've seen somebody who
would have my kind of skill
for persuasion on the other team uh
totally totally powered up because I
don't think he was really as active
before it looks it looks like he was
active but he's taking it to another
level
he is a master Persuader
he has trump-like skills but he he puts
them to use behind the curtain instead
of in front of the curtain you know
Trump say in front of the curtain
Persuader
people like teal and musk and and
Hoffman are behind the scenes persuaders
some some in front but mostly behind
this one honestly I'm afraid of how
powerful this could become just because
the people involved all right here's the
better better model for figuring out
what's true I'm going to put that out
there internet dads
internet dads
like me so this is not a name I came up
with myself you know people have been
calling me and some other people on the
independence basically the independent
political voices
have been calling us the internet dads
because we sort of act like hey I'll
take care of you you know don't worry I
got this
dad will take care of it and I feel as
if if we internet dads team up with
um let's say informal group of fact
checkers
it's really powerful I don't know if
you've watched the model that I've been
sort of a b testing here for a while
which is that whenever I see a
sketchy claim which you see every day on
on Twitter I'll take the sketchy claim
and I'll send it over to my two most
productive smartest you know analysts
who can look at pretty much any claim
and tell you where the BS is they can
spot it pretty quickly so one is uh
Andre's back house and one is uh Anatoly
lubarsky and
their their responses are just insanely
productive
right I don't know if it's all right
like you know I'm not claiming there's
anybody who gets everything right I'm
just saying that when they weigh in you
just see it differently the moment they
weigh in is like oh this this study is
crap here's the reason here's where they
got the data it's already been debunked
that sort of thing now
where I'm a little weak I realize today
is the legal stuff
but I do also have a whole bunch of
lawyers who follow me on Twitter Etc so
although I haven't formally activated
that kind of a network I could I could
just ask a legal question you know I
think you're you're Robert barnes's Etc
would weigh in and answer the question
so the internet dads have these informal
just if they have a big enough platform
they have this informal group of fact
checkers
all right who can just come in and say
yeah that's true or not true and uh I
also you may have noticed have quite a
few doctors
who follow me
now the doctors follow me for an
interesting reason which is that some
number of doctors have figured out
that they missed
they missed some lessons in medical
school
persuasion for one communication for
another
and maybe even some
some rationality in terms of you know
comparing the right things and
statistics Etc
so I get a lot of doctors who are just
trying to add a little to their talent
skill that's that's directly related to
what they do
so at this point
if you send me a
you know a rumor or a claim
I can fail easily on Twitter just put it
open to comments you read the comments
and you're really going to know more
about it I'm not going to claim we can
always get the right answer I'm just
going to claim that if you look at my
Twitter
questions and then the answer is given
is way better than any other source of
understanding the world that I've seen
yeah let me let me make that yeah Ron
Coleman's another attorney
um they're about there are a bunch of
them who retweet my stuff fairly often
so I know I have illegal advice I know
I've got Medical
and I've got economics and data analysis
so any of those fields while not well
not an expert myself
I can I can find somebody who will give
you a pretty good answer
don't you think that's a better model
than whatever this is going to be the
read Hoffman thing
now I would also say that those people
that you're calling your internet dads
they might lean a certain way but we're
not
we're not wed to any
um
philosophy I guess well maybe we went to
philosophies personal philosophies but
we're not wed to any party
right and name anybody you think is
you'd call an internet dad
whatever your definition of that is and
whoever you pick and ask yourself if
they're a slave to a party
the answer is usually not somebody's
mentioning uh Michael schellenberger now
there's a great example
so I've been interacting with and
tweeting and following Michael
schellenberger's stuff read his read his
books
I don't know what his political bias is
think about that I've had extensive
contact with them and I couldn't tell
you what his bias is I know it used to
lead left
but he found out he'd been lied to on a
lot of the the green technology stuff so
he's you know got a little turned off by
that but I have no idea I don't know who
we'd vote for nothing
I I interviewed Bjorn lombork also takes
a business approach to stuff now he's
from another country but
I talked to him for a long time and I
can't tell you if he leans left or right
not a clue nothing I just don't know
um yeah Jim Poole
who does he vote for
I don't know but I have a feeling he
could vote for whoever made sense like I
don't think he's a wed Teddy party right
how about Mike cernovich my Universal
example for every every example I use do
you think he could vote for somebody who
wasn't in a particular party yeah yeah
easily easily he could go wherever it
makes sense and you see him do it all
the time
so look for people who you're not
entirely sure what their political
leaning is and also have good advisors
that they can you know employ and maybe
this is a better model maybe you know
it's often true that things get invented
by the public accidentally
now somebody says sirovich is anti-trump
absolutely untrue absolutely untrue he's
not anti-trump
I mean that that's the most simplistic
reading of it all he's anti-somethings
that Trump has done
you could certainly be anti-somethings
that Trump has done
and you might even think that he's not
you know your first choice to be
president again I I don't know where
certain of it stands on any of that but
as soon as you say somebody's anti-trump
that's not the person I'm talking about
because if you're anti a person
you're not really deep into the thinking
part of things
uh all right
so
let me cause some trouble here
uh
here's some things we know
let's go to the Whiteboard
and yes this is going to be big trouble
I'll probably be canceled by the end of
today if I've done it right
there's some things we know if you want
to see the sources I've tweeted some of
these sources this morning so you can
see my Twitter feed but here are some of
the things we know there's this
correlation between IQ and health
and we know that smart people tend to
make smart lifestyle choices for example
the higher your IQ and education the
less likely you'll smoke cigarettes
because you know you use the information
and data and make decisions Etc
so just make making the right choices
and not not doing dumb ass things gives
you a healthier outcome now of course
isn't we're not talking about every
smart person we just talk about the
average right
smart people tend to be richer and that
allows them to live in lower crime
neighborhoods and associate with fewer
fewer bad influences and maybe get
better health care and maybe even if
they're rich they can get a uh prettier
or more handsome mate which is a signal
for health you know the more attractive
people are on average the healthier they
are so you can see lots of mechanisms
where smart people would end up
healthier
um there's also the notion that
intelligence is probably a general
indicator of health because if you're a
nervous system supports High
Intelligence or your neural your neural
network I guess apparently if you have a
fast neural network you're smart but
it's also a good indicator of Health in
general so there's all this correlation
now
now here's here's where we get Stacy
um what is your knowledge about whether
people who are more vaccinated are more
educated people vaccinated or uneducated
as a percentage
do you know in the comments
who is the most vaccinated category the
highly educated
or
the less educated
don't know don't know the answer is the
educated yeah so at the moment
and by the way this changed over time
so I think early in the pandemic when
when the vaccinations were brand new
there wasn't a lot of difference between
the educated and the uh the less
educated in terms of whether they wanted
it because nobody had any information
but the higher educated people have been
watching for a year or whatever it's
been and now they say okay we have more
information now and we're persuaded by
that more information so the educated
people are far more likely to get
vaccinated
now it could be also access information
and other things that are happening with
poverty so it's not just because people
are smarter or more educated right
somebody says phds are lower I I
question that
all right I just saw a statistic go by
that says phds have a lower rate of
vaccination I will make you a pretty big
bet that that's not true I have seen
that I've seen that data by the way but
I don't think it's true I'd make a
really big bet against that
would anybody take that back
anybody want to take the bat
and this is without research it's just
an assumption
yeah I don't think you want to take that
back anyway
um
there was a new study that found out in
scientific America
found out that uh
people who got vaccinated
with the coven vaccination
and by the way don't assume that I'm
this is leading toward trying to get you
vaccinated that's not where this is
going
all right I'm just causing trouble here
that's my only objective and by by
trouble I mean a fun a fun little mental
exercise right that's the trouble I'm
talking about
um so there's a study that showed
that people who got vaccinated
had better health outcomes in general
even unrelated to covet
they had fewer of all kinds of health
problems how do you explain that how do
you explain the fact that people who got
vaccinated
had lower health problems in general
is it because the implication was that
maybe the vaccination solves unrelated
problems
well it wasn't because the vaccination
solved a bunch of unrelated problems
probably not
it's probably because the higher IQ
educated people are getting vaccinated
at higher rates
uh and they're just healthier in general
now scientific America did a funny thing
to try to launder the news
that high IQ people are having better
outcomes
because you don't really want to tell a
story about high IQ people doing things
in society better than low IQ people why
why do you never want to write a
scientific story
that says high IQ people are doing
better than low IQ people in any context
whether it's health or economics or
anything else what why can't you do that
because it immediately turns into a
racial discussion right turns into
Eugenics and all kinds of stuff so
Scientific American
found a uh a clever way to deal with
that problem
so they wrote an article in which they
had to talk about IQ having a an outcome
it was different for high IQ and low
heat low IQ but they needed to make it
go away also
so they did this little trick this the
most clever thing that you'll see in the
publication
they said
um they laundered the correlation at the
end of the article they said wait yes
high IQ is is related to good outcomes
but
we also tested reaction time
and once we tested reaction time the IQ
correlation just disappeared
because the people with good reaction
times were the ones who had the best
outcomes and the best health outcomes in
general
and so it's really about reaction time
it's not about IQ at all
what do you suppose is related to
reaction time
what would be something you kind of
expect would be somewhat correlated with
reaction time like like a quick reflex
maybe intelligence maybe General Health
maybe people who are generally healthy
who are also generally intelligent are
generally have better reaction times
wouldn't you expect that to be true
so here's what scientific America did
they they found a
a random really random I think a random
correlation
with good health and they they tried to
confuse things no and it's not the IQ
that's the reaction time
so you stop talking about IQ well come
on
you racist it's reaction time
they just laundered the IQ they just
took the correlation and tried to
confuse you by throwing in this specious
other correlation that almost certainly
has you know I'm sure it's correlated
but there's some causation
before that right so here's a better way
to do it
a better way to approach this is to
focus on individuals instead of groups
does it really help you that much to
know that albonians have lower IQ than
I don't know left-handed albonians have
lower IQ than right-handed albonians
what are you going to do with that
what are you going to do with it how
would you act differently if you knew it
were true
if you would act differently
maybe you're a racist because you
shouldn't
the the smarter way to approach it is
just to say why are we looking at
averages
like did you ever hire an average person
there's no such thing as an average
person
the real world we hire actual people
right and actual people are all over the
place
there's no such thing as an average
actual person except by weird
coincidence right so if we just
stop making a racist assumption
you don't have to worry about where it
comes out the racist assumption is that
looking at it by race is useful
it's not
it's not useful at all
how would it be like what would you do
differently nothing
all right
um
so look out for all these uh weird
correlations that are really
not not causation
um BlackRock Investment Company
apparently is invested in China
According to some hip piece I saw on
YouTube and I don't even know who is
behind the video but it was sort of an
anti-blackrock BlackRock is an enormous
uh would you call them a hedge fund or
investment entity I'm not sure what you
call but they're enormous and they're
investing in China and somebody's making
them pay for it by calling them out I
think you're going to see more of this
I think it will get increasingly hard
for big entities that have to respond to
shareholders especially to do business
with China
so the Kyle Rittenhouse uh situation
is happening
and
I don't see any chance that he is going
to get convicted to you
let me ask you
uh I would say if you put me on the jury
for the written house thing there's no
way
that he's getting convicted if you put
me on the jury because I would I would
be the one person who held down even if
the rest of them wanted conviction don't
you think there's a hundred percent
chance
that the defense attorney can get one of
me on a jury
because I'm an absolutist on this
I'm a complete absolutist I don't want
to hear any Nuance or anything I saw him
getting attacked and and I watched him
shoot and there doesn't seem to be any
question about the video being accurate
in this case if there was some question
about the video being accurate
you know but that hasn't even been
alleged it looks like everybody says
what we saw is what happened
in that case I don't see any case
and I would say anyway he could possibly
get
unconvicted
just doesn't seem possible so what's
going to happen then there will be
rioting and people will get shot that
didn't need to get shot
so all the anti-gun people will do
exactly what they don't want to happen
which is crazy situations where people
will get shocked so I think Kyle
Rittenhouse gets off but let's uh let's
give some balance to the story
I can't be a good internet dad unless
you know I can give some balance to the
story I also would oppose knowing what
we know now but it could change
uh Alec Baldwin uh going to jail or you
know having legal problems for what he
did
now let me be clear
from a gun ownership perspective he's a
hundred percent responsible not 99.9
you know not 98 9.99 100 that's just the
standard we can't we can't be we can't
be flexible with that right all gun
owners I think are on the same page you
just can't be flexible about that the
person with in their hand is responsible
but
that's not a legal standard
that's that's a gun owner absolute and
needs to stay that way
but from a legal perspective
uh he did reasonable things that
reasonable people can do not reasonable
for a gun owner
but reasonable for a citizen
you know and I think that the I think
that the courts probably should lean
toward the reasonable citizen standard
and not the gun owner standard
because I don't think the gun owner
standard is
um it's not designed for court purposes
it's designed to create a behavior
that's an absolute Behavior about safety
it's not really quite compatible with
legal standards in my opinion so I don't
think that Ali Baldwin should be
um
should be faulted for the actual Act of
pointing and the gun and pulling the
trigger
bad judgment yes
bad judgment yes
from a gun owner perspective very bad
judgment but not Beyond a legal standard
I don't think because he did have
processes in place to make that safe he
thought now as a producer
who hired the crew
does he have some responsibility there
I'd say yes
and it looks like it's going to be his
somebody's insurance company is probably
going to pay a lot of money I guess I
assume there's some insurance that
covers this either the production or his
own
so
um
well see manslaughter would require a
reckless act and I don't think there's
evidence of a reckless act except
by the gun owner standard which is way
way tighter than a legal standard it
should be
so from Canary can everybody deal with
the Nuance the nuances that I agree with
you he's a hundred percent responsible
from a gun owner's perspective and it
has to be that way
but at the same time from a legal
perspective it's got to be a little bit
more common Sensei that's that's the way
you'd want to be judged I think
so that's my opinion neither Rittenhouse
nor uh
nor Baldwin should go to jail for
anything they did
um we got an update on the somebody told
me I'm pronouncing the name of this
place wrong Loudoun luden luden County
low down
can anybody give me the pronunciation
but it was a story about the uh the boy
uh or actually the non-binary student I
guess gender fluid student who wore a
skirt allegedly and attacked a girl in a
restroom in school a girl's restroom and
had been accused credibly of a prior
assault
now I had said when I heard the story
really
really
that everybody's concerned about some
boy putting on a skirt
as an excuse to like go into the ladies
restaurant and restroom and rape
somebody and I thought really and that
happened exactly the way people were
worried about it
well
and I said what did I predict what I
predict is I don't think there's a skirt
involved I think there's probably an
assault I definitely I never doubted the
assault
but I wasn't so sure about the skirt
problem
the current reporting is
skirt confirmed
it's current confirmed
Andrew says in all caps Andrew let me
let me explain something to Andrew
Richardson
I'm telling you I was wrong
you shouting in all caps
doesn't make me more wrong
but it does make you an
so if you want to just stick with you
being cool
compared to me being wrong and
you know and admitting it in public
you can stay keep keep your higher
status
because the moment you yelled at me in
caps you were you were
sort of worse than me
that's right the whole point is you're
supposed to be celebrating your Victory
your intellectual victory over me don't
ruin it with all caps that's like
surrendering
enjoy your Victory come on
all right now
do you remember what happened when uh I
said Kamal Harris would get the
nomination for the Dems and she didn't
and she dropped out do you remember what
I did
I doubled down I said I still think
she's going to be the the Dem nominee
I can't say that she is yet so I'm not
going to say that that is an accurate
but it's close to Accurate pretty close
isn't it
do you remember when the Vegas shooter
every all the smart people said it's
Isis I said it's definitely not Isis and
then Isis claimed responsibility
do you remember what I did
I said it's not Isis
that was right
so here's another one where I have been
confirmed to be wrong
that student was wearing a skirt and was
in the ladies restroom
I'm going to double down
and say that this story is going to fall
apart
in in an important way here's the way
that I think it'll Fall Apart
I think the skirt
may or may not be true I'm willing to
accept that there was a skirt involved
but I don't think he had anything to do
with the rape
so I don't think that anybody's going to
connect the two which was more more to
the point that that connecting the two
was the problem the idea that somebody
wore a skirt maybe with a purpose of you
know getting into a situation where they
could do some raping I don't think we're
going to find out that it was ever a
master scheme to get at the the girls in
the girls restroom
I feel like we're going to find out
there's a disturbed person who's
Disturbed in a number of ways
and that's it I think it's just going to
be a disturbed person who's Disturbed in
a variety of ways and and something bad
happened
but
I feel as though
um yeah I feel as though the skirt is
irrelevant to the story and that's what
I'm going to stick with
so I'll accept complete wrongness about
the existence of a skirt
anybody like to yell at me in all caps
this would be the time
oh actually I'll give you an exemption
I'll give you a 60-second exemption
in which you may in fact you're
encouraged
to uh gloat at my wrongness in all caps
enjoy yourself please
please enjoy yourself
skirt lives matter
wrong all encaps well done thank you
freedom
I like lamp okay
uh amen all right so we're good on that
uh Huma abedin is coming out with a book
and apparently one of the Blockbuster
things we're learning in this book is
that she once was invited by a senator
this was quite a while ago years ago
invited by a senator that she'd been in
some meeting with to come up to his
place for some coffee
she was a single woman I sounds like the
senator was single it's not mentioned
but let's say he was and well actually
we don't know anything about the senator
status but she went up to the Senator's
place to have coffee
the senator rolled up his sleeves took
off his Blazer made her some coffee
and then the senator sat down on the
couch put his hands around her shoulder
and leaned in to kiss her and was pretty
kind of aggressive about it and she said
no no no sorry I'm not here for that at
which point the senator did what
he apologized
he was like whoa whoa I read the signals
wrong
I'm very sorry
and then she said and she regrets it
that she apologized to him because she
was 24 I guess and she was like okay you
know in retrospect I should not have
apologized to him it was he who did
something
what is your uh take on that story
um for those of you who might be female
watching this now
let me
um
can I say something with one swear word
can can you send people away for just
one just one
anybody I need I need permission
can somebody give me permission for one
well-placed
f word
anybody
okay I got one
I've got a little push back here
somebody doesn't want it
okay but the locals people are saying
yes I think we're gonna have to do it
let me give you some advice for the
ladies
ladies
if a man
invites you to his place and it's just
the two of you for a beverage
be a coffee
be it alcohol
be it a
very delicious vegetarian
kind of the beverage whatever that
beverage is if a man invites you
especially a an attractive single woman
to his private place for that beverage
he has asked you if you'd like to
and you said yes probably
not yes definitely
but whether you said yes I would like to
go to your private place to have this
beverage you've offered
you
female listening to this
have told that man I would absolutely be
interested in you pretty much
tonight
now if you did not mean to send that
message
here's why I'm informing you
because if you send the message I pretty
much am up to
and the guy leans in to kiss you
he may be operating on bad information
our system doesn't put him make him you
know off the hook
you know the man is still required to
you know respond to the signals as soon
as they are clarified
right we all agree to that
um yeah if it's a hotel room it's pretty
much guaranteed so
uh
I guess this is a cautionary tale I
suppose there could be such a thing as a
24 year old
who can be in a meeting with a senator
and is still too dumb to know what an
invitation to come up to his place
really means
and the senator even said oops I read
the signals wrong no the senator didn't
read the signals wrong
the senator read the signals exactly as
they were sent
they were the wrong signals I I think it
was rather generous
very generous for the senator to say he
read the signals wrong
he didn't read anything wrong
the signals were crystal clear
they were sent wrong
so he read it right it was just sent it
wrong
that's my opinion
but I don't think anybody got hurt
which is good
um
all right
uh here's another one uh I think we
talked about that already
all right I think I've got to go and do
something else
um
this probably wasn't my best show but I
think it relaxed you just the same I can
feel your antibodies getting stronger
even now
yes and apparently she only remembered
her traumatic experience recently
um
how about come up to my place to listen
to records
yep it all means the same thing
uh
oh here we go here's some data on the
PHD thing people with a master's degree
had the least hesitancy and the highest
hesitancy was among those holding a PhD
hesitancy
hesitancy is fine
but I am only going to doubt
that uh the rate of vaccination is lower
than other people now I don't think the
PHD rate of vaccination would
necessarily be higher than the master's
degrees but I guarantee that the PHD
vaccination rate is higher than uh
non-college educated people
anybody anybody all right that's all for
now talk to you later
