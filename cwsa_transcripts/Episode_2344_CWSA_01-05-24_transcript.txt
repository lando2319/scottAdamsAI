huh let's
see why can't I see
myself camera is not working for some
reason
solo there we are hey ladies and
gentlemen can you see me now we're using
some new technology here
so we don't know what's going to happen
today Anything Could Happen how was the
sound and video for you uh YouTubers
everything
good I know we're looking good over our
locals all
right good good all right we've got
Rumble up and working looks like YouTube
is up and working I don't know
yet if we have uh Twitter up and working
we're going to check it we're uh doing
new technology today we're using the
rumble Studio to get to multiple
platforms and let me just do a quick
check to make sure we're live on X there
we are we'll all be damned so we're live
on X we're live on YouTube we're live on
Rumble we're live on locals we get
comments from everywhere except X I
guess X doesn't feed the
comments so ladies and
gentlemen would you like this to start
in the normal way so you'll feel like
everything is the way you want it to be
yeah yeah you do watch
this
good morning everybody and welcome to
coffee with Scott Adams it's the
highlight of human civilization and are
you glad you're here now let me tell you
if you'd like to take this experience up
the levels that nobody could even
imagine all you need is a cup or muger
glass of tanker chel or Stein a canteen
jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure of the dopamine h of
the day the thing that makes everything
great it's called the simultaneous
Seamus now
go oh that's
good oh so good all
right I'm just going to look at the
comments here for a moment to see if
there's anything
that's problematic it doesn't seem to
be make sure we're
current there we go wow I love this new
technology
it's working great so I've got separate
comments on the locals platform they're
going to see a little little extra
before and after the live
stream I just love this everything's
working I really wasn't expecting
this I was almost sure that today would
be just a flaming disaster but look at
this look at us look at us working
perfectly all
right well we'll talk about all the
stories including aliens in Miami we'll
get to that um there's a uh physicist
who's got some new thinking tying
together Quantum and regular physics his
name is p Oran aranowski
and I want to just read you this one
part of his new
technique in which he's trying to
understand reality itself that's right
reality
itself and he says this if the method
that I have developed turns out to be
the right one that uh that we've been
looking the right one that we have been
looking for for 100 years it also means
that the entire listen to this next part
part the entire world around us is just
a constantly waving field and SpaceTime
itself is only a way of perceiving this
field does that make any sense to any of
you how many of you know what a field is
in
physics I spent a lot of time yesterday
talking to AI chat GPT trying to figure
out what do they really mean when they
say a
field because a field doesn't have mass
or energy it's just sort of a way to
describe a set of probabilities I guess
in the real world that's how I like to
conceive of it but that's not exactly
right but uh here's something I wrote in
the 90s in the in the dilber future in
the
90s I
speculated that what
if nothing
moves what if our reality is static and
nothing ever moves the only thing that
moves is your Consciousness moving
through almost a solid but the solid
contains every possibility so if you
take a left your arm is a little higher
if you take it right your arm is a
little lower but basically your
Consciousness would be weaving through a
four-dimensional
cube so that's the way I imagined uh
reality sort of like a flip book where
you flip the pages and you can see a
little static cartoon moving so it would
seem to us like the cartoon is moving
but all we're doing is flipping through
the pages of reality with our
Consciousness I like to think about
things like
that all right well just put that out
there Brian relli has a term I like to
adopt for your own personal
AI that will be the one that's your what
he calls a intelligence
amplifier I like this a lot and the
reason is if you say there's artificial
intelligence and then there's also
humans then you say to yourself oh no
it's us against them because we're we're
so built for us against them
stuff it just turns into Terminator and
the AI is going to be our enemy the AI
is going to take our
jobs but with Brian's formulation as an
intelligence amplifier now it makes
sense doesn't it now you say oh give me
some of that AI it'll make me smarter
it's not your competitor although it
might be that too but I do like the idea
of having your own personal AI that
nobody can pollute or
control and then you feed it everything
it needs to know about you and whatever
skills you needed to know specifically
and it can interact with the larger AIS
in the world but it would also be like a
bubble wrap to protect you from those
other
AIS so that's does seem the way the
world is going so I think you have your
own personal intelligence amplifier and
one of its main uses would be to protect
you from the AI That's you know not your
personal one does that make sense I feel
like that's what it's going to look like
I think Brian's
right well I saw the most vicious uh
xplatform dunk today but it's kind of
subtle yeah you have to know a little
bit of the context for this to be as
funny as I thought it was I think I
laughed for about 10 minutes after I saw
this all right so you probably know that
the news cycle for the last several days
if you follow politics has been one
viral video after another of a ramaswami
just
obliterating some kind of news
reporter and so you see just one after
another and there's another one today of
him just you know destroying this NBC uh
reporter now you have to know the
context that vake is being really
singled down by literally everybody as
unusually gifted in his communication
and his speaking so if you didn't know
that it's not as funny to know that he's
really being single down as like the
best Communicator of our age
really and and you have to know that
he's running against uh Nikki Hy and he
often has some words for her but Nikki
hilly uh posted today on the
xplatform we have to deal with a cancer
that is mental
health
that's who V is competing
with yeah yesterday
there's yeah yesterday there's a uh a
viral video of a V getting a question
from an atheist at one of his you know
Town Hall kind of meetings in Iowa and V
goes on this you know detailed and yet
simplified explanation so it was easy to
follow about the founders of the country
he was like well Thomas Payne was an
atheist and you know he did this and uh
of course you know my favorite was
Thomas Jefferson who was a deist you
know and yes the other Founders were
were Christians but he gives you this
entire
completely
useful context and then gives a
completely elegant explanation of how
he's going to separate what he believes
about God from what he believes about
the Constitution and his job is to
follow the Constitution if as president
now it was the most elegant perfect
spontaneous no notes no ums no
pauses just you know display of sheer
Brilliance that makes you think oh maybe
America can do okay and maybe we're not
doomed and then Nikki hilly
posts we have to deal with a cancer that
is mental
health but that's not the best part
that's not the best part apparently V
has been accusing Nikki Hy of you know
having other people post her post her
social
media so after she posts this V just
reposts it and he comments he says I
think she might have actually written
this one
[Laughter]
herself I can't think of anything more
vicious
than attributing what somebody said to
them that was his insult his insult was
attributing her actual words to
her yeah I think she actually said
[Laughter]
this oh that made me laugh for so long
this morning
anyway let's talk about abste Island
we're all like digging through those
turds trying to find some gold and uh
you know ABY island is mostly just turds
but but we're pretty sure there's some
gold in there right it's like H if I
just dig through the turds long enough
I'm gonna find the story so here's the
best we got
today I guess the new new uh dump of
Epstein documents that have been
disclosed uh Bill Clinton apparently
went to the offices of Vanity
Fair and uh somewhat threatened them to
not write an article about his good
friend Epstein
do you think that really
happened I don't know I don't I don't
know if I believe anything it sounds
possible yeah I mean it sounds in the
realm of something that's possible but
it's in the news
so I I don't believe much of what's in
the news when it's a story like that you
know somebody went into an office and
said this or that I feel like those
stories are usually at least misleading
or in a context or something but all
right that was the best we
got uh since we already knew Clinton was
a friend of Epstein I don't know does
that really tell you something
new friend sticking up for a friend I
don't know so there's not much going on
in the Epstein story except a lot of
fake stories about
it well the FDA is gonna is set to
approve Florida to buy uh Canadian
Pharma drugs at much lower prices
does that sound like a good idea so
Canada has similar drugs to what we have
but they're much lower prices so the
idea is we'll just buy them from
Canada does anybody have an economics
degree who's watching
this there's just this whole thing is
because people don't understand how
anything Works isn't it isn't there
something terribly wrong with the whole
story it's like are you not
understanding how anything
works let me explain how everything
works the day that the day that Florida
is allowed to buy Pharmaceuticals from
Canada the pharmaceutical
company probably is going to raise the
price to American
prices and they're going to say Canada
if you want to continue getting these
low prices you're going to have to ban
sales to
America how's that not going to happen
so Canada is going to wake up and find
out they can't buy drugs anymore
unless they buy it at American
prices so do you think in the long run
Florida is going to get lower
prices you would have to know nothing
about economics or business to assume
this could work in the long run in the
short run probably yes probably they
could buy some drugs before Canada gets
their act together but the moment Canada
adjusts to the new reality they're going
to want to get lower prices so they're
going to say to the Pharma company okay
we'll pass a law that we don't give any
of this stuff to the United
States H H how could this possibly go
any other way can anybody give me an
idea of how this could go any other
way now I would love for it to work but
it doesn't make sense on
paper am I the only one saying this
anybody agree do you agree that it
doesn't make sense on paper that it it
couldn't possibly work in the long
run
it was worth testing you know if it were
me I'd try it so I think D santis has
the right Instinct now let's see what
happens you know maybe they can't
adjust maybe it works who
knows all right um but the complaints
are that Canada would run out of drugs
because there's not enough of
them not enough of them wouldn't big
Pharma want to sell them more drugs
like why would they run out like none of
it makes sense in any economic business
context it's like the story is just
stupid or something I don't know but
good luck with that well you know
Iceland has this big problem with
volcanoes especially lately but
apparently on the plus side they'
figured out that if they uh dig down all
the way into the Magna
core magma core um that they can they
can create some uh Power with the heat
different differentials because it's so
hot I don't think they're making a
Sterling engine but somehow they can
turn it into uh Power
sorry now what's interesting about this
in my opinion is uh I have long
speculated that the most important
technology for the
future is hole
digging digging
holes right and I think there's
something like the musks company the
boring company that makes
tunnels I think digging into the into
the Earth and doing it better and more
efficiently and you know drilling holes
and digging tunnels I think is one of it
sounds like a boring kind of
field but we have unlimited energy under
the ground if you could just if you had
the way to just dig a hole deeply
enough you have unlimited energy so it
seems to me that it was always sort of
an obvious way to go to Just improve our
whole digging technology and that looks
like what Iceland is trying to
do so I don't believe that it's a
current technology that's going to dig
into this cfla magma test bed situation
but they think they can do it so that
would be amazing keep an eye on that
holes holes are the big next
Teck all right I saw a suggestion from
uh ex user George Mack who who says that
the xplatform should have what he calls
a Steelman button a Steelman is the best
form of an argument on one side that
would be the Steelman as opposed to a
straw man which is trying to say your
opponent's argument in the weakest way
so that you can debunk
it now the idea is that uh since grock
can see all of the arguments on social
media that you could ask grock uh if you
saw a post you could ask grock to give
you the pro and the cons of the best
Arguments for the point that's in the
Tweet or the post what do you think of
that would would you like the
option of surfacing using AI to surface
the best arguments on both
sides I freaking love it you know it
does this sound like something something
I've been suggesting for a long time now
I was suggesting it before AI was
practical so I was suggesting that there
should be a way for if anybody if
anybody makes a point on some let's say
political or scientific topic or social
that other people could just add their
arguments in the comments but other
people could vote up the best of the pro
and the
cons so it would be up to the public to
decide what's the best
alternative argument that's convincing
to them but I think AI might be the
better way to go and here's the good
news uh Elon Musk posted that they're
already working on it they're already
already working on it yeah that's true
Reddit would be almost what that is yes
it would be a Reddit kind of a model but
apparently uh musk is looking at using
Gro their AI to surface the the best
arguments
now like everything one
assumes that what you're going to be
looking at is um unexpected
problems don't you think there's going
to be massive unexpected
problems um so I don't know if there was
be but it's worth a worth a shot I think
that's absolutely a productive thing to
do so good for
musk all right so uh Nikki Hy and Ronda
Sanz had their Town Halls separately one
after another on
CNN and here's what Haley says about
Trump and why you should pick somebody
who's not Trump she says that chaos
follows him and we can't have a country
in disarray blah blah blah blah blah
chaos who says who's the person who says
that Trump brings chaos where does that
come
from am I wrong that that is literally
the Democrat
attack don't the Democrats literally say
chaos is the reason you don't want Trump
they use that actual word why is she
using the Democrat word to attack
Trump because people are accusing her of
being a uni party you know half Democrat
candidate anyway it's kind of weird that
she would use the the exact argument
from the
Democrats it seems like odd choice and
not a good one because it's not a good
look so there's that and then Nikki at
Le says that uh Trump and Ron and all of
them have said let's leave Ukraine so
she's more of a support NATO support
Ukraine kind of a candidate which also
sounds like a
Democrat a little bit to me so the two
things that sort of stood out and got
called out you know in the Press were
two things that look kind of Democrat
which of course is why they highlighted
him yeah and so that's interesting and
then
dtis I I I don't know how disantis could
be more
boring like he might be a great
president by the way I I have a very
positive feeling about DeSantis as a
governor and I would imagine it would it
would cross over to the presidency I
think he'd be very
capable um but here's what he said he
introduced his new idea of a flat tax
come
on come
on come
on flat
tax flat tax is what you say when you
want to sound like
Republican but you know it'll never
happen do you know what is the least
likely thing that would ever happen in
the United States a flat tax there's
nothing less likely than that nothing so
why is he even bothering it's just so as
to have something to say it is so boring
that the the best thing he can come up
with is the oldest thing that
Republicans say that has never had a
chance of being any kind of a policy or
law
right now you know why a flat tax is
popular but ridiculous right has anybody
ever explained that to you you know why
you're not ever going to get
it let me explain let me explain the
flat
tax the funny thing about a flat tax is
everybody believes that they would pay
less
taxes everybody believes that a flat tax
would mean that they personally paid
less taxes because whenever anybody
talks about the flat tax they pick a
number that's lower than what most
people pay in taxes at least most voters
not most people but most voters so it
always sounds good it's like that good
political thing to say but it's
ridiculous there there isn't the
slightest chance that we're going to
take our taxes that are high on the rich
and low on the poor and reverse it so
that everybody's paying about the same
there isn't any chance why would he even
bring that up that is the most
ridiculous thing to bring up you might
as well say uh I'm going to issue
everybody wings so you can fly around
and you don't need a car it sounds
exactly the same
no There's no practical way that a flat
tax will ever happen absurd and by the
way I would love it do you know why I
would love a flat tax because just like
the rest of you I think I would pay less
taxes at a time when our uh when our um
our debt is out of control you think
they're going to flat tax you and and
have a lower rate for every no that's
not going to
happen all right here's a um fact
check uh this bothered me a little bit
but the problem might be on my end so I
want you to tell me if the problem is on
my end or did disantis get something
wrong when DeSantis was uh describing
the risk of fentanyl which he takes very
seriously which I appreciate he said as
an example he said that one of the risks
would be a student wants to take a pill
to to stay awake you know they to study
and you know which would be illegal but
they don't realize they have Sentinel in
it so they take the pill and they die
what's wrong with
that what's wrong with that example
student wants to stay awake to study so
they take a pill that unbeknownst to
them has Sentinel in it and then they
die an overdose what's wrong with that
example not that it's
anecdotal now well okay I'm not sure I'm
not sure I'm right but let me suggest
this if you're a student who wants to
stay awake you're looking for an upper
something like a speed or an Aderall or
you know some meth related upper you
would know that if you were asking for
an upper that whoever was offering it
knew they were offering
uppers I think it would be very rare
that somebody tried to sell you an upper
but they snuck you a downer because
that's what the fentanyl would be so
fentanyl would be a replacement for a
party drug fenol is would never ever be
in a drug that was helping you study
because it doesn't do that so while it
while it's true in general that we don't
know what's in each pill I think the
risk that the governor pointed out is
may be one that possibly has never
happened could happen but but it's
probably so rare that it would be closer
to
never because even the dealer would know
what they have the dealer isn't going to
try to sell
you opioid and tell you a speed that I
don't think that happens a
lot because you can usually find the
dealer you know you even the criminal
has some kind of you know business
Acumen they know they have to sell you
something in the general category of
what you thought you were buying if they
want to repeat
customers so anyway I don't want to make
I don't want to make that a big point I
was just curious if that is a thing that
anybody's ever heard of I've never heard
of it I've never heard of anybody dying
because they thought they were going to
get a study pill and they got fentel
instead but I've heard of it in a party
context anyway the only reason I bring
that up is I think the more our
politicians understand about the drug
the better they will be equipped to do
something productive and I thought that
showed maybe a little bit lack of
understanding of how it all
works all right another fun story is I
told you that Mark cubin is weighing in
on the xplatform in favor of Dei and
he's debated with you know musk on the
platform and uh he believes that if you
try really hard you can find all these
you know golden diamonds of uh minority
people who have been overlooked from by
discrimination and it would be behoove a
company to to try a little harder to
find those minority hires that would add
more than the average they would be even
better than the average person that they
hire and by average I mean
white so so that's Mark's uh point of
view now my point of view is that he
couldn't possibly believe what he's
saying because he's too
smart basically he's he's presenting an
argument that only dumb people present
and I think he knows it because he's
smart so I'm starting with the
assumption that Mark cubin is unusually
capable and smart and he couldn't
possibly believe what he's saying it's
the sort of thing you say like the flat
tax right the flat tax is something that
it's basically just something
politicians say it couldn't possibly
happen
and I think that when Cuban sells his
basketball team which I haven't heard a
reason for it yet maybe he said but I
haven't heard one and then he also comes
out publicly in favor of a Dei you know
a core
Democrat political point it feels like
he's the candidate under glass as if
he's just just going to be
available until the last minute in case
you need him
now if I had to guess you know I can't
read his mind he might be thinking he
doesn't want to run and doesn't want to
be president but he might also be
thinking and he would be correct because
why he's very
smart right as soon as you say he's dumb
and nothing makes sense like the whole
thing nothing makes sense assume you
smart and then build your worldview from
that because that's going to be a better
base right if he's smart he wouldn't run
because he'd be running against Biden
and you know that'd be a bad look but he
would simply raise his political profile
put his business in order where it'd be
easier to be a public figure because
it'd be hard to be a public figure and
own a basketball team it you I don't you
couldn't do it it would be a mess
because the fans you lose half of your
fans it' just be a mess so it looks
suspiciously like Mark is preparing
himself to be pressed into service at
the last minute against his will as in
well I didn't want to run for president
but uh let's say Gavin Nome had some
Scandal just you know speculating and uh
Biden had to drop out for one reason or
another who who who could be ready on
such short notice well who just sold his
basketball team and has a little T hands
might be a candidate Maybe so Mike he
doesn't believe what he's saying but
it's good
politics to
say um Bill Amman
to and as you know Bill Amman was the
one who was the hardest to get Claudine
gay Mark with Chris rufo
uh he said to Mark cuin about Dei when
Mark said how valuable D was so Atman
says that's exactly what I thought until
I did the work I encourage you to do the
same and revert Dei is not about
diversity equity and inclusion trust me
I fell for the same trap you did
Bill how much are you loving Bill
Amman keep in mind Bill Amman is a
Democrat like if you want to give him
extra extra extra credit bill Amman did
this as a
rat this is pure public
service to me it looks like to to me
this is Bill Amman just giving something
to the country because he thought he
could it looks like the classic
situation where he didn't wake up and
say I want to do this I don't think he
woke up and said oh this is the first
choice of things I want to do try to get
rid of a Harvard president I think he
thought he was maybe one of the few
people who could make it happen he
simply had the ability so he took his
ability and he applied it to the benefit
in my opinion of the country and he's
doing it again by showing the
Counterpoint to Mark Cuban's point of
view and I I could not respect this more
I mean this is this is very
clearly um independent of party
loyalties and it does seem like it is
entirely based on what's good for the
country I just don't see any other
motive so that that's your dad energy
right there that is pure dad energy so
good for
you then Elon Musk replied to uh Mark
cubin so we get all our billionaires in
in on the ACT here and so when uh Mark
Cuban said you know Dei is so good for
the company Elan mus said cool so when
should we expect to see a short white or
Asian woman on the
Mavericks now he he might be a little
behind and not know that Cuban is
selling the Mavericks although I think
he might be staying associated with them
in some way I don't know the
details so yeah how do you answer
that I think what uh what Cuban said was
if you look at the entire organization
it's actually you know is more
diverse
now is that making a better or making it
worse let me think almost all the
players are
black but if you include the executives
it's really quite
diverse I'm not sure that's the point
you wanted to make mark because it
sounds to me like the executives are
mostly not black and the players are
mostly black which would sound exactly
like a problem not a
solution just say
it now uh Mike
Ben uh weighs in and shows two pictures
next to each other on X uh one picture
is a picture of his basketball team
players who are uh that look like I
don't know 90% black I couldn't tell um
then it was next to it was a picture of
the executives of his new healthc care
company who are uh let's say much less
black but to be fair to Mark cubin if
you were to add his basketball team to
his healthc care company and looked at
it as an average very
diverse that's
right
so slap right back at
you I call it pocket
diversity as long as anywhere any
anywhere else is a different color I'm
diverse you know sitting here doing
doing this live stream you're probably
saying to yourself I've seen nothing but
a white man since I started
watching but what you don't know is if
you walk out the door around the corner
through a gated community and up four
houses you would find that I have a
black
neighbor so if you count the entire
neighborhood which is mostly just that
one house plus
me that would be diverse on average
so that's sort of Mark Cuban diversity I
got going
here so um
um that's funny uh then Christ rufo
weigh in on the Mark Cuban uh Dei
opinion he says Mark Cuban needs to
think Beyond euphemisms his supportive
Dei is like hearing about re-education
camps and thinking great idea I support
education and I love camping
read your Orwell he
says now that's a good take he likes Dei
because he likes diversity equity and
inclusion and rufu says that's like
saying you like education camps
re-education camps because you like
education and you love
camping so those are two good
things no more Democrats and no more
Republicans well I don't buy that
framing I see what you're saying you
know I understand the point that there's
no more Democrats and no more
Republicans because they all want War I
get that but that's not reality I mean
war is the one place where they do act
the same in a lot of ways but there's
more to war in the
world not much but there is
more so I asked the following question
on X in a poll I said who who has lost
more jobs because of racism and I gave
people four choices Claudine
gay Scott
Adams Abraham
Lincoln and Derek
Chauvin now who do you think
won I'm happy to say that I won and that
is the correct answer I I lost the most
jobs so claudian gay lost one job Derek
Chauvin lost one job
and Abraham Lincoln well he lost one job
I lost
four and I'm probably not done I'm sure
I've got at least one more to lose I
lost two corporate careers because I was
a white male if you're new to my content
they did tell me
directly that's why I became a
cartoonist because my corporate career
couldn't go anywhere because I was a
white male and again I'll tell you both
in the bank that I worked in and then
when I left because they told me that I
went to the phone company they told me
that directly in in direct words we
can't promote you because you're white
and male so that's when I became a
cartoonist you may have heard that I
recently got
cancelled for saying that other people
might not like
me I did not say that I didn't like
other people you may have heard it that
way but nothing like that happened I
said according to the polls and
everything I see in in the news there
might be people who don't like me and I
would like to stay away from people who
don't like me and I got canceled for
that do you think a black man would have
been cancelled for saying maybe I should
stay away from people who are
racist of course not because everybody
thinks that's a completely rational
thing to say why would you want to spend
time with people who don't like you the
most obvious thing in the world is you
should put some
distance so I lost lost my cartooning
career or at least the way it used to
run I'm still doing it of course um I
also lost my TV
show because
UPN where the show ran decided that
Monday where the my show was would would
be a black uh black content
only so once you lose your time slot
usually you're kind of screwed and
that's what happened so I've lost four
careers directly for being a white male
and making content that's about more
white males than anything
else now can anybody beat that do you do
you know any black person in America
who's ever lost four jobs for being
black have you ever heard of that I've
never heard of
it I think I'm the winner I I'm the most
discri I'm the most racially and gender
discriminated person in America would
would you
disagree find somebody who can top my
story four
careers four high-end careers plus
publishing I also lost my um so five if
you count my my book writing career
which is kind of separate has five
careers what about my speaking
career I lost my speaking
career why because I supported Trump was
that because um people said oh so you
seem kind of Republican so we don't want
you to be a
speaker no it's because they said I was
a racist because I was
white all right if i' been I imagine you
know black it wouldn't have made much
difference so that's five
careers TV speaking
cartooning Banking and the phone company
each of those directly because of my
color and my
gender how many many of you were aware
of
that now I couldn't even talk about this
until the last few years until Trump
really I couldn't even talk about it do
you know why because if I talked about
how much discrimination I had
experienced do you know what people
would say oh you big baby oh
yeah because you're so discriminated
against in the United States as a white
man it must be tough it must be tough to
be a white man have I ever said that
you ever do you ever hear me say it's
tough to be a white
man I don't say that you know why
because you can figure it out right no
I'm more focused on figuring it out I'll
figure it out I figured it out those
other times I'm still figuring out
there's still plenty of things you can
do it's not like you're going to die if
you get some discrimination
but it's context I think it's important
to know and not everybody gets to go
become a cartoonist if they get if they
can't get hired you saw the statistics
that the year after George Floyd there
was a whole bunch of hiring in the
country and only 6% of corporate jobs
went to white
people
6% everything else went to people of
color and women I
guess all right
um
so Seth ABR son famous for being a
Democrat who is very Democrat he thinks
that Chris rufo um if he if Chris rufo
turned out to be a foreign agent linked
to the criminal and allies it would be
the least surprising thing that's
happened so Christopher rufo who is
putting his reputation and his you know
life into the mission of making sure
that the United States focuses on Merit
and accomplishment
over racial identity and Seth irson
thinks that focusing on
Merit is destroying the
country how does that work so do we
think that Putin is trying to destroy
America by making us more
capable so Putin wants us to focus on
Merit through Christopher R rufo is that
was
now I've said it before but I like when
there's new
examples this is this is playing like
comedy Now how how can I treat this as a
serious
opinion this a serious opinion that
favoring Merit over racial identity must
be a r Russian plot to destroy the
United States you don't even have to add
anything to it you can simply describe
it the way it was described
and you laugh it's it's it it's
funny in a way that you just shake your
head it's like oh my God what's wrong
with this
guy the funny part also is that he
probably does that to me like I'm I'm
sure Seth Abra Abra Abram son has looked
at my content or people like me and
shook his head and said oh my God I mean
actually he's doing it with Christopher
rufo he's like oh my God how could he
how could he want
Merit how could he want the Constitution
of the United States to mean something
how could
he well here's uh our latest on
immigration the 2023 number of illegal
aliens is 10
times the 2017 rate do you know what we
were talking about in
2017 do you remember in 2017 we were
saying we have an emergency at the board
because there are so many illegals
coming across in
2017 it was such an
emergency that Trump largely got elected
on the promise of
stopping it's now 10
times 10 times the level of when it was
emergency 10
times now I I think I saw Elon mus say
this and I was a little hesitant to
agree but I'm going to go fully into
agreement at this point this is clearly
intentional there there's no way
this is a mistake can can we say that as
clearly as possible there's no
way this is anything but an attempt to
destroy the
country now you might say no no Scott
it's an attempt to change the voting
characteristic of the country so the
Democrats get an advantage
no I'm sorry no maybe at the 2017 level
that was an
argument because it wasn't going to
destroy the country at that level in my
opinion but it might have changed over
time changed the voting you know
mix but at the 2023 level and even
2022 this is the end of the
country this is not the same th this is
clearly whoever is in charge of our
country is not
us can we agree on that there's I'm
going to say it as directly as I
can there's no way an American
is in charge of
this there's no way an American
is in charge of anything about
immigration wherever this is coming from
we can rule out
America might be coming from the cartels
maybe Russia's doing something clever I
don't know about maybe China is doing
something I don't know about but it's
definitely not coming from an
American it's not coming from Joe
Biden's opinion about how the world
should be it is
not Biden's not in charge mayorcas is
clearly not in
charge somebody's in charge and we
better figure out who it is we better
figure out who it is really fast in the
comments somebody says Jews
really I'm going to nominate you for the
dumbest comment of the day you
think the Jews are want open immigration
to bring in as many people who who hate
the Jews as possible could you come up
with a worse opinion than
that that's
absurd yeah there there are many people
of all types who might favor you know
being with immigration but there's no
 person who wanted 3 million
illegal people to come in in one year
you you show me one person who's in
favor of that who's actually an American
and not crazy you can't show show me a
an elected politician who thinks three
million was a good
number no you
can't so we do have an emergency I think
to uh get a president who is at least
American right now I don't know what the
deal is with Joe Biden I don't know what
the deal is but he doesn't operate like
an American and that seems like the most
basic the most basic thing you
do as a president of the United States
is be identifiable as vaguely
American somewhat
American he's not he's not doing that he
barely he barely can make you
know a mirror uh he he can barely fog a
mirror at this point it would have been
funnier if I could have said that
clearly the first time
but yeah we need to figure out who's in
charge and it's definitely not an
American in fact I think that that
should be a republican talking point
they should say there's no way an
American is in favor of this so let's
figure out who's running and we
better we better figure it out fast
there is no way an American is behind
this policy there is no way no way is
not a little bit of chance there's no
chance an American is behind
this all
right um there's a report that says the
uh uh the average IQ of college students
has been dropping to the point where the
average IQ of a college graduate or a
student is the same as the IQ of people
who did not go to
college does that surprise
you that the average
IQ of college people is now the same as
non- College
people no of course it doesn't surprise
you it's exactly what it looks like now
part of it is that more people get to go
to college right so it used to be that
the elite could go to college now almost
everybody can at least the community
college so if you throw in the community
college uh people you know the community
college is the the average person in
America so of course it's should be
around average now um I know you're
going to say that the diversity quotas
have driven down the average IQ and that
is unkind and
racist it's true because if you know
based on math so has nothing to do with
the IQ of the people that they're bring
in that's not the point the point is if
you try too hard to bring in any group
you know small pool of people you'll run
out of the smartest ones before you run
out of the need to get more of them so
in theory just because too many people
chasing too small a pool of
people should make you get a lower lower
candidate eventually which has nothing
to do with the genetics or capability of
any people it's just math you could
reverse all the races and it would be
the same phenomenon if you're shopping
in a limited pool all
right let's talk about aliens so this uh
David uh grush he's The Whistleblower
who says we got at least 10 aliens and
crash spacecrafts and oh man we got so
much alien stuff we got the biologics we
got the pilots we got the spacecrafts
all over the place totally real
right that's totally
[Music]
real I don't think any of it's real do
how many of you think that there are
creatures whether or not they're aliens
they could be always have been here or
spiritual or something how many of you
think there are non-human Advanced
entities lying around the
earth okay we do have a few yeses uh I'm
going to go with a hard no on that um
I'd love to be wrong but hard no and
there's going to be a top secret closed
door meeting with the house oversight
committee and
uh we just love our aliens now a related
story did you hear the story about the
uh Miami Mall
so something happened yesterday I think
it was in
Miami so one story is that there were
some uh teens who got in a stick fight
and there were reports that maybe there
was a shooter or something and there was
a massive police
response now that would be the ordinary
story there was some trouble at them all
police came but if you see the aerial
photo
of the event I guess they had some kind
of helicopter or drone photos then the
size of the police
response looks bigger than anything I've
ever seen in my life like such a police
response that it looked down a
place next there were reports that there
were 10-ft tall aliens who were shadowy
and walking around and maybe somebody
shot at
them right so
now next we have a lack of cell phone
smartphone videos from whatever would
have been a normal disturbance so if
there had been a stick fight and it was
teenagers by now we would already see
posts of the videos that somebody else
took at the stick fight but we haven't
so people are putting together these
Clues and saying wait a minute we
haven't seen confirmation that it was an
ordinary event the police presence was
wildly you know H
gigantic and somebody thinks that they
have a a grainy video of a a shadowy
figure walking through the police cars
or something but I couldn't see it when
I looked at it so I don't believe that
it's
aliens I'm just telling you that it's a
story in the
news but I wouldn't wait for any
aliens yeah uh what I would wait for is
why are we not being told what actually
is happening there's clearly something
missing in the story but maybe we'll
find out today maybe it's illegal aliens
you
say it's New Year's and that's why the
cops didn't happen on New Year's evening
did
it I don't
know we got
questions um and there were lost power
and there helicopters and all that stuff
uh Michael shellenberger has gone all in
on the idea that Epstein was a uh sex
blackmail
operation how many of you would say
that's obvious at this point do you
think we have sufficient credible
information that to say Epstein was part
of a government related we don't know
which one people say mad but might be
more than one might be just one other
you don't know um but we can say that
for sure now can't we yeah I feel like
that's established sufficiently
established
looks like the comments died on YouTube
so I don't know if anybody's still
watching me on this one anybody still
watching on this feed on YouTube or
Rumble because the comments stopped five
minutes
ago all right so I actually don't know
if I'm still doing a stream I might be
live and I might not be there's no
indication says live I'm going to act
like it's
live but I do something see something
blinking like it's an
error maybe it's
not all
right so it's kind of a weird slow news
day we had such a good uh beginning of
the week that there wasn't much else to
say so that ladies and gentlemen comes
the
conclusion of the best live stream
you've ever seen I remind you that if
you don't have a copy of my
book reframe your brain oh it's
different on

what platform you're looking at you can
see it with a different finger so uh the
reviews are the best reviews I've ever
gotten for a book they're crazy and and
people are telling me it's changing
their lives it's very easy book to read
and learn some reframes and it will
change your life as well so pick that up
if you don't have it and uh I'm going to
say thanks for joining if you're still
here on Rumble and x and on uh YouTube
