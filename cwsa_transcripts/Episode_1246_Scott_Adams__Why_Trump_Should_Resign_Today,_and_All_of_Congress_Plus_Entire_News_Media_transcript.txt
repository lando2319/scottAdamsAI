hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
yeah it's time for coffee with scott
adams best part of the day
and i feel as though that's been proven
beyond a
scientific doubt and if you'd like to
enjoy it
to its maximum extent
all the provocation and there will be
some
all you need is a cup or a margarita
glass of tanker chelsea styling a
canteen jugger flask
vessel of any kind fill it with
what your favorite liquid and join me
now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes
everything better except a capital
protest
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
yeah that was
just what i hoped it would be
so let's talk about all the things
uh in the news uh i'm keeping count and
so far
73 people today have criticized me for
opinions i do not hold
it's about one per minute so actually
that number has probably climbed since
we
since we signed on here i hear there was
a story about
georgia winning both of the two senate
seats but
nobody seems interested
[Laughter]
literally the biggest story in the
country is that the senate was going to
go
democrat and barely talking about it
it was like the entire political world
just turned upside down and all we can
care about is
whether trump's going to resign or
something
like suddenly it went from the biggest
question in the world to
now here's the question do you think
that democrats having control of the
senate
will allow them to do the things they
want to do
if you imagined that
congress was comprised of
competent people with the best interests
of the country and
at heart you'd think that having a
majority would be a
pretty good deal but
if you believe that congress no matter
who has the majority in what
is a bunch of incompetent uh
people who do not have your interests in
mind
then it's not going to really matter is
it
in theory they won't be able to do
anything useful
because it's the same bunch of
incompetence as before
they have a majority but you know on
paper
on paper it looks like they could just
push through tax increases and all kinds
of stuff
and i'm sure there will be some of that
i mean it's not as if they won't make
any changes
but i imagine that we we over imagine
how much change they can get away with
you want you want to hear the funniest
thing this is the funniest thing
about the senate being so close but just
barely democrat just barely
do you know what that means that means
that if i were a democrat and a senator
do you know what i would do
well i'm not proud of this but if i were
a democrat
this year and a senator
i would go to the republicans and i'd
say you know if i switch
parties pretty good deal for you guys
isn't it
yeah yeah and but if i did that
i'd certainly want something in return
something pretty darn big
so that's one way i could go you know i
i can't imagine
that there's not one senator who isn't
thinking you know
i could be the most powerful person in
the world
if i just sometimes say i'm not going to
vote with my team
do you get that we just turned over the
senator to one person
we just don't know who it is yet there
will be one democrat
who becomes the famous one for sometimes
not going the way the democrats always
go
that person runs congress we just gave
congress to one person and we don't even
know who it is
will it be joe manchin right some people
say
you know he's not really the maverick
type he only votes against his team when
other people are doing it
i'm just saying we just created a system
in which it will only take one person
to decide to run the entire congress and
they can do it
they just have to create a reputation of
sometimes voting for the other side
do you know who would be good to do that
i know this is definitely not going to
happen
but i'll just put it out there as a
thought this is just a thought
experiment
there is one member of uh well no you
need a senator
so i guess that was a bad example uh
what i was going to say
is if aoc were a senator instead of a
representative i could see her being one
of the people who would be smart enough
to know she could just take over the
country
she just has to show some ability to
change sides sometimes
now it would be tough for her because
she's more extreme on the left
and not a senator but in concept you can
see you can see what we just did to
ourselves
the country just funneled all of its
power into one person
and we don't know who it is we don't
even have the name of the person
i'm hearing tulsi
oh my god you're right
you're right we just handed power to
tulsi gabbard
how do you feel about that
not too bad it could be a lot worse
right
how would you feel if you knew for sure
that just through the strange confluence
of events
we'd accidentally given the most power
in the country to tulsi gabbard
because i feel like maybe that just
happened didn't it
that would be the funniest outcome all
right
so we got a number of people quitting
in the trump cabinet i guess betsy devos
and i guess elaine chow
the mcconnell's wife
and a bunch of other people quitting in
the trump
administration and people on both sides
now they're republicans
calling for trump to resign or they
maybe uh uh do the 25th amendment
and take him out for medical reasons or
maybe impeach him
and i tweeted this morning that this
would be a good time
for trump to resign do you know how many
twitter users
you lose if you tweet today's a good
time
good time for trump to resign well it's
thousands
it's thousands so i did uh i'm a little
lighter on twitter followers
but uh i feel bad for the people who
don't wait for the second part
those of you who have been with me for a
while you know to wait for the second
part
right because it was never just the
first part
it was always the second part so let me
tell you why i think this is a good day
for trump to resign number one
it's friday friday is a good day to
leave a job
a good day to fire somebody because you
just got the weekend right after it
so friday is always the best day of the
week to do stuff like that
right if you're the person doing it
friday is a good time
um number two
trump has never had better negotiating
uh leverage right how many people want
trump to leave
immediately well you've got all the
democrats
they want them to leave immediately they
don't want to mess with impeachment or
25th amendment if they don't have to
immediately how about republicans there
are plenty of republicans who are saying
um it's time i think even tucker carlson
said
trump's uh you know his date of
expiration has passed
so you've got plenty of republicans who
think it's time got plenty of
democrats who think it's time
trump's negotiating position just peaked
now and only now
can he say to a mike pence how about
this
pardon everybody in my family for
everything including me
and i'll go early do you see it yet
he's never been in a better position
since realizing that he would probably
lose the election he's never been in a
stronger position
if he's not talking to pence about a
deal
he's missing like the best opportunity
to make a deal ever
because it's the only time that both
sides would say yeah
yeah get them out of there if we have to
make a deal we'll do it but get them out
of there
that's when i'd do it so i'm saying that
today is a good day to resign
now remember trump has already committed
to
an orderly transfer of power it's not
like he's going to get something done
in the next two weeks what's he going to
do do a trade deal with china
probably not uh what exactly was he
gonna do
for the country in the next two weeks i
can't think of anything
but he could create trouble right he can
create trouble
now maybe he's got some extra pardons
pardoned assange you know pardon some
other people i would do that first
right or you could work that into a pen
steel
you could even say pence you have to
pardon
assange and then i'll leave right away
something like that
so he could still get some stuff done
like pardons
but there's no there's never been a
better time to resign
um i would on top of that i would say
that he has
uh destroyed any chance of a 2024 run
i don't think that's even slightly
practical at this point
because trump has um he took a little
too far
i think he took it a little too far part
of the reason that we've liked him as a
president
those who have liked the show so far is
because he takes things a little too far
that's more of a feature than a flaw but
you know that taking things a little too
far
isn't going to work every time and this
is a pretty strong example of where it
didn't work
now if this were the first term
and trump had done something of
equivalent
uh level to be criticized as his
as his rhetoric about the capital and
you know however much he encouraged that
we assume some if he'd done this in the
first term
people like me would have said all right
all right that's bad
that's not that's not good but you'd
have to weigh that
against the benefit you imagine he could
do over the next three years
he'd say i don't like that but i don't
want him to leave because i want those
other benefits
right but if you only have two weeks
left
what the hell benefits are you gonna get
i'm not expecting any benefits
in the next two weeks so right now he's
just a cost
every day that you know he's in the news
it makes people who have supported him
such as myself
look bad so at this point it's just all
downside
now i have great affection for the
president you know as you know i bet him
personally
liked him a lot you know if you spend 10
minutes chatting with him
you're probably going to walk away
liking him he's a real likable
human being and he's got the you know
the big personality and everything it's
all real
i mean you feel it when you're in the
room he's he's quite
charismatic but there is a time
when you have to say what's good for you
personally what's good for the country
and sometimes it might be a little
different than what's good for your
president
that this is that time now having said
that this is a good time for president
trump
to resign and i think that the criticism
that he
encouraged the capital protests that
went too far
and resulted in deaths we'll talk about
that that's fair
i think that's a fair criticism but
again
given that there's only two weeks anyway
it's it's stronger than it would be if
it had been in the first term
it just means a different thing but i
would uh
take that argument that says the capital
protest would not have happened
unless trump's rhetoric had been
let's say supportive of it do you would
you agree that that's true
could you say that if trump had either
been against the january sixth thing or
simply
not made as big a deal about you know
what he made a bigger deal about
probably it wouldn't have happened right
do we all agree that that's true and
therefore
since it wouldn't have happened without
his
actions you say well he takes
responsibility
but if you take that theory oh wait for
the second part you complainers
there's a second part but if you take
that same theory and say that
it wouldn't have happened except for the
actions of
a person you you should extend that
logically
to anything else that also had to happen
right so there there had to be
an environment in which this could
happen so you had to have massive
uh incompetence in congress and in our
elected officials
to make an election system that wasn't
credible
wouldn't you say that congress has full
responsibility
for making an election system that
wasn't credible
and because of that if you would if you
would remove that variable there would
be no
would have been no protest at the
capitol so using the same standard i
think this is the
would be an appropriate time for trump
to resign
largely because of his encouraging of
the
of the protests that went too far but
congress i think also should resign
every one of them all of them and if
there's anybody
in congress who is not actively working
on fixing the election system
for the next time well they should they
should resign
because they're just going to cause the
same problem again
if people are resigning today because of
what got
what was caused this week by their
actions
they should just resign right away
because 2024 they're already causing
another revolt by not
fixing the problem not even addressing
it so i would say every member of
congress
all republicans and all democrats who
are not actively working
on fixing it for next time that every
one of them needs to resign
and and i don't think there's any
question about that is there would
anybody question that
now of course you want your your person
to stay so your party has more
members i get that but as a general
statement
would you say that any member of
congress the senate
the house if they're not actively
working on
pushing for better election credibility
they have to resign
i mean they really have to resign
because they're both responsible for
this the problems this year
but they're already creating the same
problem for next year
you can't even blame trump for that
right trump won't be here
but congress will be here and they're
already creating the same problem
for the next time by not working to fix
it
so yeah they all have to quit they'll
have to have to resign if we're being
consistent
now also uh contributing to this
situation yesterday was the fake news
if we had real news where you could
depend on it
and you could rely on it the real news
would have said
here's the situation with the vote and
let's say that they said it was a
credible election because they did
what if the fake news had been a
credible institution for the last
several years
how would you feel if the news that you
trusted
said yeah i know it looks like trump
lost
and i know you're looking at all these
indicators but trust us
we looked into it trump actually lost
fair and square what if a legitimate
news organization told you that and you
said ah
these guys are usually honest they're
usually right
it looks it looks like it was stolen but
i guess it wasn't what would be the
result
well obviously there would not have been
a protest at the capitol
so everybody who works in the fake news
industry anybody who pushed the russia
collusion hoax
the fine people hoax the drinking bleach
hoax
and even this hoax so this week we're
watching the press
push a new hoax the hoax is that this
was a coup attempt
the the fake news i think the atlantic
has something about this
the fake news even right now is telling
you that that was a coup attempt
now i'm no expert coup
plotter but let me tell you how
plotting a cue a coup never looks
here's how it never looks in the
planning phase hey
you want to overtake the government good
idea i'm
in how do you want to do it well we're
going to need
resources yeah if you're going to plan a
coup to take over the
the country you're going to need some
resources what are you going to bring
well i'm going to bring a viking horns
and i heard there's a guy who's got some
twist ties
should we bring anything else like
perhaps deadly weapons
don't see why well one reason would be
you're planning a coup
against the most advanced military power
in the history of the solar system what
do you think it would take to get that
done
that's going to take 10 11
twist ties some people would say that
would take 20
30 twist ties but i don't think so
that's just over
planning i think small bunch
of twist ties if you know not by
themselves
obviously you're not going to take over
a country with one handful of twist ties
i don't want to leave you
with that impression you would also need
a guy who has viking horns
and importantly make sure that nobody
brings a deadly weapon
and brandishes it you don't want that
so your your news if you can even
 call them that is reporting that
this was a coup attempt
with a handful of twist ties and a guy
with viking horns those are the only
weapons
now if we had an honest dependable
news organization along with social
media that would support it with you
know not
let's say not filtering the wrong people
and not promoting the wrong stories etc
i don't feel like the capital protest
would have happened
so i'm calling for the um the
resignation today
of all the ceos of the social media
platforms
because they're clearly complicit if you
took out the effect of social media
would there have been protests of course
not
of course not you'd have to have that
element for these protests to happen
and that element would have to be not
honest
for this to happen then there you go so
certainly the president should resign
and by the way i mean that
i mean that seriously he should actually
resign
both for his own good if he can work out
the best deal
because of the situation but also for
the good of the country
we don't have any extra benefit to get
from him
and he is our he's our servant
right we elected him to do stuff for us
when he's done doing stuff for us
because there's nothing he can do with
the next few days it's just going to be
causing trouble
so now is the time it doesn't matter if
you've been a supporter of him or
how much you love him how much you think
you should still be president
doesn't matter if you think the election
was stolen or not stolen
it's just time it's just time right
things have ends we're there so
you should definitely resign but all the
members of congress should resign
and certainly any member of congress who
didn't speak out against
the blm and antifa riots all summer
including this week portland's again
under you know
under siege with nearly
nightly riots now anybody in congress
who didn't speak out about that
including today because it's still
happening well they have to resign
i mean that's easy right so all of the
all the congress people who are on that
they need to resign all the
fake news industry they need to resign
all the ceos of the social media
platforms
need to resign and i would like to offer
my
own resignation unfortunately i don't
have a boss so it doesn't hold the same
weight as other people resigning but if
it makes you feel better
would would trump have been elected
if people like me had not supported him
well not by myself i probably didn't
make the difference to put him over the
line
but i'm part of a group of people whose
support
if you imagine did not exist he would
not be president there would be no
protest at the capitol so i feel like i
should resign
i just don't have a boss so
might be a little bit more you know
theater
but uh i offer you my resignation for my
role
in all of this i take full
responsibility
um let's see what else is going on here
uh and by the way does anybody disagree
that trump's 2024 run
ended this week there's not really any
chance that he could run for president
again
and by the way i wouldn't i wouldn't
support it for 2024
based on age alone so it wouldn't matter
what else was true it wouldn't matter
he's the only one who can beat
whoever he's running against or it's
fair
or it's the only way we can take back
the country or you know there will be
lots of arguments
for him and he might actually be in
pretty good shape
in four years you know it's perfectly
perfectly possible that he's
has all of his faculties etc but you
couldn't bet on that for the four years
after that that would be a pretty bad
bet
so no his 2024 run is i say
completely done um at least in terms of
the odds of winning it's completely done
by this week um
i guess kimberly stressel wrote an
article in the wall street journal
in which one of the things she said was
the pity is that mr trump's
conflag conflagration
will mostly burn the americans he wants
washington help they will bear the
higher taxes higher costs of regulation
the higher unemployment the loss of
freedoms
et cetera so would you say that
um trump's conflagration conflagrations
there's a word i never use in public or
even in writing
i would recommend that you not use that
word either that's one of those words
that
maybe just never use it because it's a
bigger word
than what you need to say what you say
and why would you use a word
that half of the people reading it don't
understand
why would you do that so don't use that
word conflagration
conflagration
but do you think that what trump's
actions
whatever his actions were this week do
you think that it caused
the republic or let's say his actions
you know
collectively do you think it cost him
the election
which therefore cost his supporters all
the things that they wanted is that a
fair statement
i'm not sure if i'm quite capturing
kim's kimberly strassel's argument so
i'll just say that
i'm asking the question
i don't know you can make that argument
but i think
you know if people elected a fighter and
they got a fighter
i don't know i'm not quite buying into
that
criticism so here's an argument that i'm
hearing today
uh about the uh about the
election fraud claims which
because i'm on social media i have to
frame this by saying
there is no proof no proof
of any election irregularity that would
make a difference to the outcome
but having said that so that i don't get
de-platformed yet today here's the
argument i'm
i'm hearing about the court cases that
were put forward and
i guess 59 out of 60 failed and and the
one that didn't fail didn't seem that
important or something
but people are actually arguing with
these
two points of view as if they're
compatible number one
that the trump supporting lawyers who
put forward all of these
lawsuits that they included
the best fraud arguments
so so this is the first part so the uh
trump critics are saying
the lawyers who put forth all of these
cases that failed
um they they put together
that that it was complete and had all
the claims in it although all the strong
claims were there
and that judges have seen the strong
claims
and and ruled that they weren't strong
and dismissed them
so that's one claim the other claim is
that the
those same lawyers who did a thorough
and complete job of
the best fraud allegations and they
captured them in lawsuits and put them
forward those same
highly qualified lawyers who didn't miss
anything
they got all the good arguments and put
them forward but somehow
although they're really capable and
competent of getting the best arguments
they're also crazy clowns who can't tell
a
conspiracy theory that's kind of obvious
from the truth
so somehow these two opposites are being
put forward
that the lawyers were thorough and got
everything and
and presented everything and therefore
the court rejected them
but also those same lawyers that are so
thorough and good at making arguments
are also completely crazy conspiracy
clowns i feel like you have to pick one
i've picked one and the one i picked is
i don't believe that there's any chance
that the lawyers were capable enough to
put together the strong argument
do you believe it do you think that this
group of lawyers
had the capability to look at let's say
the statistical arguments
and know the good ones from the bad ones
ask the right questions
i don't think they had anything like
that capability if you would just judge
from their public statements
the lawyers and here i'm talking about
the
sydney powell's the the linwoods not
talking about uh
jenna ellison so i'm talking about the
the ones who are a little bit more out
there
not the ones who are sticking to the
constitutional questions that's all just
fair
but the ones who are out there and then
what which lawyers were they that
put together the ones that are not
directly from the trump administration
that was most of them right
what kind of capability did any of those
lawyers have
well i feel like you know you've got
some strong attorneys
definitely but it looked like most of
them were deeply incompetent
so why would i assume that the courts
have seen a good argument
i assume that they haven't now that
doesn't mean a good argument exists
all i know is if you're arguing that the
lawyers presented the good arguments
i would say that's completely
inconsistent with
anything i saw from the lawyers who were
in charge of the arguments
i didn't see any competence i didn't see
anything that looked even remotely
competent
from trump's main attorneys again not
not uh jen ellis there's there's some
that were sticking to the constitutional
questions mostly
um so
that's my argument my argument is that
the argument that the case has not been
made
now people quite reasonably ask me what
did i think were these strong arguments
i'll tell you what the weak ones are the
weak ones are
i saw this thing on videotape week
because it's not there i watch the same
videotape
the ones about the pristine ballots you
know there can't be any unfolded ballots
that's been debunked there can be there
are reasons
that are that are good um the
shredded ballots that peers debunked
because
i think they just shred some envelopes
or something
and i can go down the line the the dead
people
voting has not been proven the
people with the wrong addresses at least
hasn't been proven
now there's some question about whether
the the information has been made
available so you could prove or disprove
these things
but i would say all of those claims fall
into the category of things that
95 chance are fake you know the
the van showing up with the fake votes
and stuff
maybe i mean anything's possible if i
had to bet
i'd bet against it so those that class
of things i will categorize as
in my subjective opinion as unlikely to
be true
so that will be collectively the weak
the weak
criticisms doesn't mean they're true
they're not true
i'm not saying that none of them are
true i'm saying that from
my limited you know a vantage point
where i don't know the real truth
i'm just looking at the claims because
that's all i know
they don't look strong to me so if
somebody's asking me
my opinion what would be strong claims i
would say for example
we don't have access to the software
we haven't done an audit of the you know
the the data logs
we don't have um there's lots of
eyewitness evidence
that the observers were limited
the the italian story i don't put any
credibility in again
i suppose anything's possible but i
would say that the
the italian connection that doesn't look
even slightly plausible to me
by its nature i don't have any inside
knowledge about it
it's just that sometimes when there's a
story about bigfoot
you don't really have to research it
it's just it's bigfoot you can tell just
by looking at it
right you don't need too much research
that said every once in a while there's
going to be something that looks
ridiculous it looks like it's a bigfoot
but that's true you know every once in a
while
so you never know for sure i just put it
in the category of things that are
really really unlikely to be true now
let's talk about the strong evidence
i would say the strong evidence is an
eyewitness of anything
especially if there's more than one one
eyewitness
yeah but two eyewitnesses
now you're getting towards something um
any kind of
a and as i said the fact that we haven't
audited the software
while at the same time we know that it
is hackable
because all all systems are there's no
exception to that
and then i would say these statistical
claims not every one of them
but that some of them are backed by
statisticians who do seem to have
the right data i would call those strong
claims
now when i say something is a strong
claim
is that the same as saying it's true no
there are just some claims that by their
nature
look really strong now i don't know if
they've been debunked or not i'll give
you one example
of one that by its nature sounds strong
but that doesn't mean it's true and i
mentioned this before
if you had two let's say voting
precincts right next to each other
and for since the beginning of time they
always voted the same way
because they have basically the same
demographics you know you've got let's
say
sixty percent are democrats and every
year sixty percent
same same ratio and then
this year they diverged wildly
well that could be a coincidence could
be somebody did better
voter voter i don't know get out the
vote in one than the other
but if you have enough of them if you
have enough of them
that tells a different story you know
one or two no big deal
but all the right ones just the right
places
well you so so if a professional
statistician
says i'm using the official database you
can look at it yourself
here's my math and i've calculated that
the odds that this was a fair election
are 0.01 or i'm just making this up but
something like that i would call that
strong evidence
which is not necessarily true
meaning that there could be another
explanation it's just we don't know what
it is
so would that suppose that case
were made in court would a judge say ah
the statistics are
quite compelling therefore i rule it was
a fake
election not without direct evidence
right if you're in a court
if you're in court don't you have to
have direct evidence is statistical
enough
i'm not a lawyer so i don't know the
answer to that now it might be if you
had enough statistical doubt that the
court could order
i don't know a recount or a re-election
or something so i don't know how that
would work legally
i'm just making the general statement
the strong evidence would be
statistical evidence in which everybody
agrees on the database
nobody's doubting the data came from the
right place an
actual expert in the field not an
amateur
and ideally maybe another expert who
looks at it and says yeah you did the
math right
i would consider that strong evidence
now which of the 59 court cases
was the example that i just gave you
which of those did the judge evaluate
that specific thing that i just
mentioned
and decided that it wasn't convincing
i don't know the reason i don't know is
that we don't have a functional
news business imagine if we did
if i were if i were a reporter and i
wanted to do an actual like real job
where i gave real information to people
it would look like this
i would say what are all the allegations
and then i would do what i just did in
public here i would sort them from the
ones that
if they were true would be strong versus
the ones that
you know they're just bigfoot claims and
then i would take the few that looked
strong
and i would do a story about them i'd
talk to the statistician
i'd make sure i talked to another
statistician say hey did he do this work
right
can you check this out i'd make sure
that the database is the same one that
both sides agree as the actual data and
then i'd write an opinion on it
where's that have you read a story like
that
can you imagine anything that would be
more important than that story
somebody looking at the strongest claim
and just sort of digging into it a
little bit
the only ones i see are where the fake
news takes the weakest
claims so they'll take you know they'll
say 10 of the weakest claims
of there might be 25 or 30 claims
they'll debunk the ten and they'll leave
you the impression
that those were the good ones but they
weren't
they were the dumb ones so the public is
of course being manipulated
and brainwashed by the propaganda that
that strong claims have been evaluated
but i've not seen any evidence of that
i mean it could be could be that they
have been
i just have no evidence of it because we
don't have a media news media that works
so um ali alexander who is
organizer of the stop the steel event
january 6
which um got out of hand and turned into
these capital
protests um
i'm wondering how he's feeling about
this today
because now we know that five people
died
and here's the
here's the bigger question will we ever
have a protest in the future in which
uh they would in which the protests if
they're let's say they're peaceful
protests
or they're intended to be peaceful will
we ever have a protest where bad
elements don't get into it to break
stuff and hurt people
because i feel as if we never will have
another situation
where there could be a peaceful protest
because they'll always be the
instigators who say ah this is perfect
and whether they're anti-fa or just
people like trouble
they'll just go there to break stuff and
cause trouble and then
whatever trouble that is will be you
know
applied to the reputation of the entire
thing
so have we seen the end of public
protests that can work
because a public protest doesn't work if
there are bad elements in it that are
killing people or breaking stuff
so i would say that black lives matter
had this you know
great cause great intentions
but because of the looters who ended you
know the anti-fun the looters who
tagged themselves onto the movement they
ended up
behind the curve you know recommending
dumb stuff like
you know defunding the police probably
hurt them politically set them back
so i don't know if we may have reached a
point where you just can't have a
friendly protest
and come out ahead that every time you
have a protest you come out behind
certainly black lives matter i would say
they came out behind
and i would say that the capital
protests came out behind as well
and both for the same reason they both
had you know bad elements in them
that did not represent the sentiment of
the whole
but this the whole gets the reputation
of the few
i don't know i feel as if public protest
just won't work anymore
what's that do to you speaking of public
protest
apparently michelle obama is
recommending an end to free speech
which is interesting now technically
since there wouldn't be the
government who would be making these
decisions
she's saying the tech companies should
permanently permanently ban
trump from their platforms if
it is ever okay to ban somebody
like trump why wouldn't it be okay
to ban people who also had similarly
provocative and sometimes incorrect
ideas
as soon as you as soon as you allow that
this is okay
that you can pick out one person and ban
them
you can kind of ban everybody after that
now i don't believe in the slippery
slope
but this isn't even a slippery slope
this is starting at the bottom of the
hill
if you can ban trump for being
incorrect but you're not going to ban
biden for
inciting violence against trump
supporters all day yesterday
i mean that's what he did biden was
inciting violence against
people like me in the country demonizing
half the country
but michelle obama would say he could he
could stay
uh despite the fine people hoax and the
most divisive lies we've ever seen
i would say more so than trump you know
trump's divisive
but i think biden beat him by a little
bit you know not a lot
maybe 20 worse
but if biden's okay and trump isn't
that's the
end of freedom of speech practically you
know
the constitution will still say it but
if social media can
shut you down that's how you speak
these days so for michelle obama to
actually come out
unambiguously against freedom of speech
those are my words not hers but it's
pretty unambiguous what this means
it's shocking it's just shocking
and that it's treated as just the
suggestion
this isn't just the suggestion this
would be the end of everything because
if you get rid of freedom of speech
the way michelle obama is suggesting
that is straight to totalitarianism you
know
you won't even pause straight to
totalitarianism if
you do that um so did
biden encourage violence against trump
supporters or am i
exaggerating well he did paint the trump
supporters as
being complicit essentially in whatever
trump did
and certainly he's painted
trump as a racist and therefore all of
his supporters
i would say that he did in fact paint a
target on the back of trump supporters
now let's compare because we're um
what will happen starting now is that
everything
biden does will be compared to
everything that trump did
in the similar situation right that's
unavoidable so let's
let's start now and start keeping track
when when trump and pence were
first elected and before they were
inaugurated do you remember
how i was talking glowingly about their
pre-inauguration work
because they went to ford and tried to
convince them to keep jobs here they
went to carrier
now i don't think either those two
things made much difference
in fact i don't think any jobs were
created from that
but i was praising it not for those
specifics not about forward and not
about carrier
but because it created
an understanding in the country about
how serious
trump was about jobs and especially
keeping jobs in the united states
and i think that that was transformative
about how we thought about it
you know what was a priority and then he
went and he succeeded
right he had the lowest unemployment set
all kinds of records
so i would say if you were to judge the
trump
pence pre-inauguration phase
it's the best i've ever seen by far
name anybody else who made a difference
pre-inauguration i've never never even
heard of it
but but trump bench did and it was real
i called it out at the time it's not
you know i'm not 20 20 hindsight guy i
called it out live at the time
now compare that to biden he just did
the the most
divisive speech i've ever heard from a
president or
president-elect and i would give him a
complete failing grade to the point of i
think he should resign
i think i think biden should resign
because of his speech yesterday
condemning half of the country is racist
now
so if you're keeping score and this is
inevitable
the pre-inauguration phase for pence and
trump is a plus
that was my score when it happened
biden's pre-inauguration is a failing
grade he's literally
suggesting or promoting violence against
half the country
i don't know if you could fail harder
than that really
what could biden have done that would
have been even worse
pre-inauguration once he has power he
can do things that are worse
but until he has power i
don't know that he could find any way to
be worse
actually he did some of his appointments
apparently
involve people who push the russia
collusion hoax
that's worse well maybe it's not
maybe it's not worse it's not worse than
promoting violence against half the
country
in my opinion that's my interpretation
of what he was doing
so i would say biden is the worst
president we've ever had
pre-inauguration
and and trump is the best president
we've ever ever had
pre-inauguration so as we go i'll keep
doing my scorecard
but right now it's not even close not
even close
now will biden provide a better job
in his transition of power probably
so so if you want to look ahead i'll
probably be giving biden higher marks
for whatever he does when he transitions
and leaves office
then i'm giving trump because i'm
literally saying trump should resign
over it
so you know i'm trying to be fair
but so far it's one to nothing trump
all right apparently there were two pipe
bombs during this
this situation the at the capitol uh one
pipe bomb was put not by the republican
national committee headquarters and the
other
pipe bombed by the democratic national
committee headquarters
who do you think placed two pipe bombs
in those two locations
was it republicans
do republicans put pipe bombs in front
of republican
and democratic headquarters probably not
was it democrats would they put a pipe
bomb in front of the
republican office and the democratic
office
probably not probably not what entity or
entities would put a bomb
at both of those places while there was
also going to be a
big organized protest well antifa
yeah antifa would do it because antifa
wants
everybody to be fighting everybody in
chaos
and i'm not interpreting that's actually
what they want explicitly
what about china would china put a pipe
bomb in those two places to
cause trouble in the united states i'm
not saying they did
i'm saying they would how about
russia sure yeah russia would do that
anybody who wanted the united states to
do poorly
would do that but it's not the people
who were marching
it's definitely not the people who were
there for the
stop the steel event it wasn't them
they're the only ones you can rule out
now
let's count up as i said there were five
people who died
as a result of various things let's
count up
the number of people who were killed
by any intentional act of the protesters
all right so five people died let's
count up how many of the five
were killed by the protesters zero
zero right now
there was a police officer who died of
injuries
and you might say to yourself well
there's one somebody injured him to the
point of death
but here's what we know and by the way
if that if that proved
to be true then that's just true
we don't have that information yet but
at the moment what it looks like is we
had one person who died of a stroke
one person who somehow got trampled to
death which i don't quite
understand you know i don't really know
how you get trampled to death
but i mean it could happen i i could see
it with a gigantic crowd
a soccer riot but i don't know how it
happened in this case
i guess it could but obviously that's
not a case of anything intentionally
being done it's
it's tragic but an accident there was a
case of the
some law enforcement person who shot one
of the protesters who was unarmed
but again that wasn't the fault of the
protesters
shooting anybody else it was them
getting shot
and then there were some uh how many
police officers three police officers
who died no how many died but a few
police officers died based on
something that happened now here's
i don't want to make light of any deaths
because they're all tragic
and we'll take them all seriously but it
has to be said
that if you were to compare the
protesters at the capitol
to let's say an anti-fa or black lives
matter protest
it has to be said that there is a
difference in
health in other words you've never heard
of anybody in the black lives matter or
anti-fog group
who were killed because they had a
stroke
while they were protesting it's a
healthier group
they're younger they seem to be far more
fit
they could ride all night but the trump
supporters unfortunately were not
let's say in the healthy lifestyle
uh segment of the population and
you just mobilize that many old fat
people and somebody's just gonna drop
dead and that's
probably what happened i would bet that
when when we find out what happened
with the law enforcement people who died
that it might be some combination of bad
health
plus the things that were happening i
don't know that they died because
somebody stabbed him shot him
or bludgeoned them i feel as if you know
there's a lot yet to learn
but whatever those whatever killed those
policemen
it could be very similar to whatever
killed the number of the protesters
which is
bad health you know you couldn't
survive a crowd couldn't survive the
excitement
couldn't survive you know something that
would have not killed somebody else
so it has to be said that the deaths are
at least
partially a demographic
uh artifact meaning that if you put a
bunch of 70 plus
year old overweight people into an
exciting
physical situation people are going to
get hurt you put a bunch of young antifa
people in the same situation maybe not
so much
there is a difference
yeah there's a big difference in age
right so that's that's a big deal
all right so uh just to reinforce i'm
not mocking
anybody i'm saying that that's a real
difference and and you can't ignore it
um so
let's see uh everybody's calling this an
attempted coup but that's
crazy because viking horns is not a coup
uh the other thing you're hearing is
that if
uh if black lives matter had tried to
take over the capitol
the uh the pushback would have been
different
that they would the guns would start
blazing away
and uh that'd be a different result
to which i say would it
i don't feel like that's a reasonable
assumption
because what we watched was a white
woman who was unarmed being shot through
the neck
intentionally and i'm thinking to myself
it would be worse it would be worse than
that
shooting somebody who is unarmed isn't
that like
the worst thing it would be one thing if
she was
you know attacking the person who shot
her but she was just coming through a
window
now let me say as clearly as i can i
don't know what the law enforcement
rules or strategies are in that
situation
and if there were let's say if mike
pence was behind that door
maybe you can shoot people maybe you can
you know that would be the extreme
situation so i don't want to judge
before i know all of the facts
but it's hard for me to imagine it would
be worse
if they were if if it had been black
lives matter
i feel as if if it had been black lives
matter they would have done the same
thing
which is if the numbers were so great
they would have gotten out of the way
because the the capitol police took
injuries
it's it's obvious that the capitol
police used physical
um defense at least and physical force
it's obvious that they put in the work
they took the personal risk
and i have great respect for all the
individuals who did that
but once the numbers were big enough of
the protesters
the smart play was to get out of the way
are you telling me
that if exactly the same situation
happened with black protesters
and there was so many of them that once
once the
defenders had realized they couldn't
hold them back and they got
what would they do start blazing away
and shooting into the crowd
i don't think so i think they would have
gotten out of the way
exactly like what you saw would they
have shot
one of the black protesters in the neck
and killed them maybe
maybe if it was the same situation first
one to
break through a barrier pence is in the
other room maybe
but i actually doubt it if i had to
guess
what it would look like if that crowd
had been black it would be either
exactly the same
or one less shooting because
you really have to think twice three
times four times five times
before you shoot a black protester or a
black suspect
or anybody black because you know the
pushback will be
extreme if you shoot a white person
you've got a problem with the shooting
itself but you don't have a riot
if you shoot a black person it doesn't
matter the reason we know that
it doesn't matter the reason i mean if
they're unarmed that's
that's the whole story right unarmed
done
um it'd be a huge riot so i feel as if
the people who say there would be more
pushback if they were black
i feel like it's the opposite
but there's no way to test it i mean
you're not going to run the experiment
um so as a
joel pollock asked on twitter if
trump is going to be blocked by social
media and you've got
joe biden who just at the same day
he lied about trump and tear gas he lied
about trump and holding the bible
he repeated the fine people hoax and he
called
capital police racists essentially as
saying that they would have acted
differently if there were black
protesters
and as joel says all these statements
could be used to justify violence
i think that's a fair analysis so
if you can't get rid of biden for doing
basically the same thing trump is doing
he's just the democrat doing it then
you better not get rid of anybody all
right
that is trump going on locals
uh don jr is on locals so if uh
might happen yet you never know all
right that's all i got for
now uh somebody says were there not
black people at the magna protest there
were
now i am seeing reports of antifa
you know being in the crowd and they
look credible
i don't know if it's true but the video
i saw
did seem to look like it was antifa and
it did look
did seem to look like the maga people
were calling them antifa
and trying to stop them from breaking
windows again
video lies so you never know
but um that's what it looked like
um yeah
all right i'm just going to look at your
comments for a moment
andrew yang has proposals on media and
social media oh that would be
interesting
you know i have very high opinion of
andrew yang only because he has
uh interesting and innovative ideas
that are not sort of you know obvious
political things so even when andrew
yang says things that maybe i don't
agree with
i so fully respect the way he thinks
about it
and the fact that his intentions are
unambiguously positive
that um anything andrew yang says
you should take it seriously he's a
patriot
um am i worried about being thrown in
prison by biden harris administration
a little bit yeah yeah a little bit
see the problem is not that i would be
arrested for you know
something that i'm doing in public or
something i said the problem is that if
you get on an enemies list
as chuck schumer said the intelligence
agencies have
a thousand ways from sunday to get back
at you
now i'm not saying that any intelligence
agency would come after me
but uh yeah i'm worried that there will
be some kind of
retribution and i would say that if you
based it on the
the rhetoric there's every intention of
retribution
so i do expect that i will be targeted
first by the media i think they're all
probably already starting today
have you seen this start yet by the end
of today
maybe over the weekend i'll bet you i
can forward you some articles that are
hit pieces on me
that haven't even been written yet it's
kind of predictable if you've been doing
this for a while
so i do believe that some pressure will
be applied to me
what my critics fail to understand
is that i'm not like other people
meaning that i don't have a boss uh that
will fire me and even if my
customers all fired me i'd be fine
so that's their first uh miscalculation
if they come after me
the second one is that unlike other
people i do know how to
transform energy into my benefit
so if they came at me with massive
negative energy
unlike someone who is not trained i
could convert it into my energy
and i would just get new users and have
more audience and have a bigger platform
so if they come after me i don't think
i'm going to go down as easily
as they hope i'm probably more
anti-fragile than
than what they're used to so going after
me would have a cost
for example they've been going after me
democrats have pretty
viciously for four years and i have the
largest following i've ever had
for this topic so i don't think it works
on me
but it's going to happen um
there's a petition for cj somebody says
all right i'm just uh you can always
find me on the locals platform
if anything happens to me on the other
social media platforms
and
head on a swivel i don't know what that
means now
stay off planes yeah i think i'll stay
off plans
all right that's all i have for now and
i will talk to you later
all right all you youtubers where's the
slaughter meter
so the the thing that i'll have to deal
with maybe forever
is that i predicted trump would win
reelection
and of course biden will be inaugurated
but what's
weird about it is we don't really know
if i'm right or wrong
because my prediction was not about a
system taking over and replacing the
votes it wasn't about
fraud i just said that trump would get
the the most votes
in the right places for the electoral
college to be
reelected now that didn't happen but
i don't know if you could say my
prediction was wrong
if the reason we suspect it may have
gone the way it did
was because of rules rule changes last
minute
and you know the coronavirus and
everything else
so i'm not sure that any prediction made
sense
because so many things changed that are
not just
the voters voting there were so many
things in the environment
you know allegations of fraud but at the
very least
there was you know media manipulation
and rule changes and
lawyer tricks and all that so i'm not
sure that we saw anything
like an election so somebody says to me
scott
you said trump would win the election
what do you say now i say did we have an
election
because i'm not aware of anything like a
credible election
we had something we called an election
but if half the country doesn't believe
it really happened did we have an
election
well sort of a matter of an opinion
isn't it we had an event
but it certainly wasn't a cr a credible
and transparent
election was it fair i don't know
because it wasn't
credible and transparent had it been
maybe i could
determine if it had also been fair
that's something i'll never know
so i don't think you can determine
whether i was right or wrong
unless there was an election that we all
agree was an actual election
and since that's not the case i would
say that i get it
incomplete on that prediction although
if i were going to make a list i'd say
that i got it wrong
um somebody says the only hypnotist that
has never hypnotized anyone
don't know what that means uh
right fire somebody
keeps asking me about it to talk about
it
uh i don't have any reason to talk about
that
i don't use analogies as predictions or
reasons
and neither should you do you know what
you should compare to the reichstag
fire nothing nothing do you know what
you should compare to the holocaust
nothing not a single thing
do you know what you should compare to
hitler nobody
and you shouldn't use that as an analogy
i mean it's a
cautionary tale so it's worth worth that
and we should learn as much as we can
from it
but as soon as you're labeling other
people hitler you're just in
a ridiculous land uh
why ever vote again well let's see if
the
election system is more stable
here's a good question wait i want this
one to come back
who pays you who supplied the bots and
trolls
do you really think i'm paid let me let
me answer directly
uh the only i don't get paid by any
political entity
directly or indirectly i only make money
from the live stream
and if i sell a book or something so no
i i'm not paid by anybody that would be
great though
uh would be terrific if somebody wanted
to give me money for doing what i'm
doing anyway
so if anybody wants to pretend they're
bribing me while i just do what i was
going to do anyway
that'd be cool
and you're still asking me to talk about
the reichstag fire
um let me tell you as clearly as
possible i'm not going to talk about
that
because it would be a dumb thing to talk
about all right so
having asked for it now 10 times i will
block you
let's say uh remove
i guess i can remove it but i can't
block you here i'll block you later
all right so no more questions about
reichstag fires please
and i will talk to you tomorrow
