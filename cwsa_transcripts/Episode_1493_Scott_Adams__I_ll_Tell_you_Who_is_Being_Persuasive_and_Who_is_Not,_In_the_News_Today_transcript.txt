good morning everybody
hey it's time for coffee with scott
adams again
one of the best things that's ever
happened to you in your whole life
and i will die on the hill and if you'd
like to take it up a notch
you probably do
um all you need is a copper marker glass
a tanker jealous or stein i can't a
jagar flask a vessel of any kind fill it
with your favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine end of the day the thing that
makes everything better except
ivormectin
it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens now go
i saw an interesting
comment
just moments before i went live here
from ian
who says
i wonder
if we would be in the same situation if
trump
had not uh become the thing that the
media lied about
so trump not only
exposed the media for being fake news
but by his existence he probably created
more of it because they were after him
so hard they just started making up
stuff like oh he says drink bleach or
neo-nazis or fine people now most of you
watching this know that that was never
happened those were hoaxes
but
if the media keeps selling you hoaxes
and then a pandemic comes
and the only way that you know what to
do
is because the media told you what is
true and what is false
what are you going to do
what are you going to do
and i wonder if the media is not killing
hundreds of thousands of people
well let's go to another topic um
ellen barkin famous uh aging actress
ellen barkin
uh tweeted what is the expiration date
for cis white males
what what is the expiration date
for a demographic group
uh
shouldn't we be a little worried about
that kind of language
is the group that i belong to have an
expiration date
as in
i'm not allowed to be a member of
society
what exactly does it mean if i expire
can i be
shot
jailed
executed
what's it mean
well glenn greenwald was not about to
let that uh go and so he tweeted about
her tweet
it's utter madness that discourse like
this is acceptable and even celebrated
rather than resulting in instant
shunning now interesting that he used
shunning instead of canceling i don't i
don't think he's a big
fan of cancellation but
you know individuals can shun
and then he adds this note he goes
moreover famous straight rich white
women she's literally
is or was married to a billionaire and
was a famous actress right so that's her
situation
famous straight rich white women somehow
concocts a definition of the privileged
class that excludes her
how in the world did she not find
herself in the privileged class that's
annoying the rest of the world
now here's a question for you
how many of you know what
cis
white male
even means
cis
in the comments
tell me how many of you don't even know
what that means
so yes or no no no means you don't know
what it means
[Laughter]
look at all the no's a lot of yeses
a lot of no's now isn't it a word that's
been in the news for quite quite some
time
it has been right
do you know when i learned what it means
uh i was today years old when i learned
what i'm what it means i looked it up
just before i came on
now i always knew what it meant in
context
yeah it was just your generic uh
basically a generic person who was
the actual definition is somebody who
was born
the same gender that they present
themselves as
all right i mean i i think i'm botching
the definition a little bit but
basically it's somebody who was born in
the gender that they recognize as their
current gender
so i guess it's some i thought the cis
stood for something but it's just some
latin derivation i guess
and
anyway just the fact that that word
exists
is kind of a
kind of an eyebrow razor
but yeah so there are people who can
actually say on twitter that an entire
demographic group of which i am a member
uh maybe needs to be expired
and we're okay with that that's okay i
guess you can say that in public
wow here's three things we learned in
the past year number one
if you don't look for a problem
logically
it does not exist
now i read this again
on cnn's page
today
even today
literally today
an opinion piece
uh says that the courts didn't find any
fraud therefore
logically it doesn't exist now is it the
job of a court are they designed to find
fraud that nobody has brought to their
attention
nope
number two the things we've learned this
past year do your own research
leads to at least some people eating
horse pills and snarfing bleach and then
dying
of course i'm being hyperbolic and
and all that but my point is that doing
your own research
have we proven now that that was never a
real thing
i mean you could try it
but haven't we proven that people can't
do that
who was the first person you ever heard
tell you that doing your own research is
the dumbest thing anybody ever
thought of
now i'm not saying that there are people
who can't get the right answer
but they don't know they have the right
answer
it's luck
you can't do your own research
that's not a thing
it's not a thing even close to a thing
it's not even in the realm of the zip
code
of a universe in which that's a thing
you can't do your own research
you're not smart enough
do you know who else can't do their own
research on let's say medical stuff
doctors
because they're not coming to the same
conclusion
if they all came to the same conclusion
we'd either all
like ivermectin or not like ivermectin
but we'd be on the same page
the fact that even doctors disagree
whether ivormectin works or is proven to
work
or is a good risk management
thing to do
if the doctors can't figure it out
what the hell are you going to do
right and and you say to yourself well
scott scott's got
95 of doctors are on the same side
so clearly they can do it on average and
clearly they came to the right answer oh
really is that what happened do you
think all 95 of those doctors did their
own research
no
some probably did
the rest of them just listened to what
the other doctors were saying
and said the same thing
just like every other profession
all right
number three things we learned it's a
coincidence
total coincidence that every public
health policy is also good for big
pharma
it's just a coincidence
how many boosters do you need
unlimited
maybe for the rest of your life
um
is it a coincidence
it looks like it
right i mean i can't
i can't connect any dots and tell you
it's not a coincidence
but it's a pretty big one
pretty big one
all right
uh there's a
story coming out today i saw it in the
daily mail
that there are anonymous biden staffers
who claim that when biden is on tv
talking they will turn down the sound
because it makes them too anxious
thinking that biden will say the wrong
thing he'll either gaff or he'll take
questions when he's not supposed to take
questions
do you think that's true
it's in the news
it's in the news anonymous staffers
say they they sometimes will turn off
the sound
because it's too cringy to watch their
boss talk
true
not true
all right let's try this test
if you saw this story about trump
would you believe it
would you believe it if you heard it
about trump
anonymous staffer
says something behind his back
would you believe it no you wouldn't
if it was your president and i'm just
saying that because i think most of my
audience
was or is trump supporters
um if you heard that about trump you
wouldn't believe it
so why would you apply a different
standard to biden
well confirmation bias right
you think to yourself well if it's biden
they probably do think that
yeah if it's biden they probably do turn
off the sound
maybe
here's what is most likely
probably somebody said it
probably the number of people who do it
is that one person who said it or maybe
the one person who said it heard about
one person who did it
and it probably wasn't a high level
staffer we're not talking about the
chief of staff turning off the sound
right that didn't happen
so it might be
like slightly slightly tiny true for one
person who talked to one reporter
but no this is
right shoe on the other foot if this
were trump you wouldn't believe it for a
second
anonymous internal sources
yeah don't believe it for a second could
it be true yeah it could be it could be
true
it's not credible
but it could be true
texas passed their voting law
uh new voting laws of course the critics
say it's uh
it's trying to make it harder for
minorities to vote
um but here's what we know
uh abbott governor abbott of texas and
other lawmakers they argue that the new
rules will make it easier to vote
so they're not trying to restrict voting
they say they're trying to make it
easier and one of the ways they're doing
that is by expanding the required early
voting hours in the state
so how can you argue with that
expanding the number of hours to vote
does that restrict voting
or does it give you more time to vote
for everybody
oh that's just one version of the story
you want to hear the other version
this is on cnn 2. but critics point to
the reduction in early voting hours in
some of the state's most populous areas
which will now be prohibited from
allowing overnight
early voting
so they're increasing the early voting
in general
but some places already had more early
voting than that so the places who
already had overnight voting have to
reduce to get back to the standard and
all the places that didn't have early
voting or as much of it have to increase
to reach the standard
so is this a clever trick by the
republicans
to
because let's say that they know the
populist areas or where there's more
minorities and is making it harder to
vote there
but easier to vote in your white areas
is that what's happening
because if it is
the critics have a point don't they
well let me put this rule out there for
you
nobody is ever going to make a voting
change that works against their party
are we done
are we done
there's nothing else to say
no politician will ever make any changes
to the election process
unless
they believe it's good for their party
does it matter that it might also make
sense in some logical way of
reducing fraud
well it matters
but it's not why they do it
do you think if the republicans were
easily getting elected with the current
system
and they thought that that would
continue do you think they'd be all
about fixing the system
no
hello dr johnson and goodbye
i'll hide you on this channel
anyway
so when i look at the how the cnn has
covered this it is almost as if they
don't want you to understand the topic
all right
let me read these two sentences again
and you tell me does cnn want you to
understand the topic or to accept
uncritically
that it's racist
which are they doing here or read the
two sentences again abbott and other
lawmakers argue the new rules will make
it easier to vote by expanding the
required early voting hours in the state
and then they say
but critics point to the reduction in
early voting hours in some of the
state's most populous areas which will
now be prohibited from allowing
overnight early voting
right so those are two points of view
that are
opposites
doesn't cnn owe us a little bit of uh
solution
as in
a little bit more analysis that says
which of these views is correct
all they did is simply tell us what
other people think
is there no objective truth here
is it purely opinion and once you've
said what the two opinions are you're
done
this is a news organization
shouldn't a news organization say there
are two opinions
and let us fact check those two opinions
nope
no fact checking
just shows you the opinions
why would they show you the opinions
without the fact checking
well
for the same reason that any political
party will only make choices
about changing the election that help
them
cnn will also only do things that help
cnn
and cnn
doesn't want you to see clearly
apparently
does not want you to clearly know
what the texas law is it is not
they don't want you to know
does fox
does fox news want you to know
exactly what the the law is and and why
some say is racist and really sort of
dig into that
i doubt it
i think i think they want to wave their
hands at it and get their audience
assuming it's
assuming that it's a good thing
and cnn wants to wave their hands at it
and get their their audience to assume
it's a bad thing
without anybody digging into it to say
why it's good or why it's bad
all right
so it's all illegitimate
um
here's some news on the infrastructure
plan
um if you'd like you can record this and
just replay it every day
well it looks like there's going to be
some trouble getting the infrastructure
plan passed through congress
do you know what the news on this will
be tomorrow
well it looks like there's some trouble
getting the infrastructure bill through
congress how about the week after
two weeks after three months later
well looks like there's trouble getting
the infrastructure built through
congress
just guessing
well matt walsh was trending today i
guess we could call him conservative
writer commentator
would that be a fair description i don't
like to describe people
in words that they don't use to describe
themselves but
just so you know who i'm talking about
and he tweeted this i guess there's some
controversy that he's following up on he
said yes
i said that i don't like female analysts
and reporters in football
no i don't care if that upsets you no i
don't apologize yes i think women are
feminizing traditional
traditionally male spaces yes i think
that's bad
yes i'm right
no your whining doesn't change any of
this
and of course he's trending because
women said he was being terribly
terribly sexist and why can't women have
jobs
in sports and men's sports in particular
now
personally i do not watch
brain damage as entertainment
and football and boxing are basically
brain damage packaged as entertainment
that's a little bit of hyperbole but not
too much
so i don't really watch it i don't care
i don't care who's broadcasting it
especially with all the the kneeling and
stuff i really don't care about football
at all
but if i were a fan
i'm pretty sure i would want the
commentators to have experience playing
football
wouldn't you
i would think
now clearly there are people who
men
who do come and comment on sports with
which they're
you know not terribly familiar because
they didn't play it
that's the thing
but i would say the same thing about the
men
all things being equal
wouldn't it be better if the
sportscasters had experience with the
game their sports casting now they have
color commentary to to help them out on
that so it plugs the gap a little bit
but i would think you'd want experienced
people people who have at least played
it in high school or something you know
they know how it feels
uh somebody mentioned
bob costa because he's like five or six
or something and said well you know he
probably didn't play football
to which i say
no if he was a boy in america
he almost certainly played football at
least you know during gym class and
stuff
i don't know any males in america who
haven't played football if they're that
age i suppose things might have changed
is there any
let's see in the comments let's say so
people over
40.
if you're over 40 and male
is there anybody who's over 40 and male
who has never played football you know
not even a pickup game
oh here we go some people say i've never
played football
so it does exist
but it's kind of rare i think
somebody says i'm 46 and not once
yeah i would think yeah of course i
played football
i mean pick up games
pick up games without padding and we
played we played tackle when i was a kid
we played tackle football without
padding without helmets
i thought everybody did
we weren't very smart
rasmus and poll says that 77 percent of
the people polled say they would get a
booster shot
which surprises me
i would think that would be closer to
100
because it seems to me that once you've
committed yourself to the vaccination
path
i feel like your brain would talk you
into being consistent with your last
decision
so i'm actually surprised that it's only
77
and maybe it's it's of course
could be skewed by people who did not
get the vaccination answering it too i
suppose
um
anyway that seemed low to me now it
seemed low not because of whether you
should get a booster or not that's not
the point it seemed low because in terms
of psychology
people like to be consistent
and 77 percent is pretty big but i would
have thought it'd be 90 95
would have been where my best guess
would have been
well over the philippines police have
killed four chinese nationals
in a sting operation because they would
the chinese were bringing in
half a ton of meth
do you know how much damage you can do
with
half a ton
of meth
because it doesn't take much meth to get
you going
half a ton
they brought into the philippines so the
philippine police killed them
i don't know the details that
um
but
i'd like to see more killing of chinese
dealers
and i'll say again i think we have the
moral
and legal right to kill chinese
fentanyl dealers in china
like in their house
i think we have the moral
um and complete legal authority to do
that
now you could argue blah blah blah that
it's illegal i just don't want to hear
it
because it's just self-defense there
isn't really any argument against
self-defense
i'm sorry there's no argument against
self-defense and killing chinese dealers
whose names we know
whose addresses we know
we know their names and addresses of the
actual dealers in china
and we should kill them
right where they sleep
it doesn't have to look like murder i
mean it could look like a fentanyl
overdose for example
right it doesn't have to look like
murder but they should be dropping like
flies at this point now would this cause
uh chinese intelligence agencies to
start killing americans
maybe
still worth doing
because they're not going to kill 94 000
americans to get even if we kill one
dealer
or three or four
they might kill three or four people we
don't want to be killed
but we're talking about trying to reduce
tens of thousands of fentanyl deaths a
year now you could argue oh scott if you
stop the chinese fentanyl
somebody else will just jump in and make
it the cartels will figure out how to
make it themselves something like that
yeah maybe but they're going to need
those precursors they come out of china
so i would say uh we need to normalize
the idea that we should be killing
chinese citizens on chinese soil
if they're mass murderers of americans
and that means they're dealers of
fentanyl
and i don't i wouldn't worry about it
one bit i wouldn't worry about the
chinese reaction for one second
because the problem is so huge
that you need to kill people
to stop it you just need to kill people
you need to kill the dealers
specifically
i'm not talking about the little dealers
that sell a little you know out of high
school or something
all right uh joe biden was talking about
tornadoes
the other day and he says they don't
call them that anymore
have you heard of the new name for
tornadoes
i haven't
uh i have some ideas
we should call them
wind and namies
maybe blow a canes blower canes
uh
about uh
yeah all right so enough of that
uh dr
tony moore
uh tweeted
this about ivermectin so he's a doctor
so listen to him because he's a doctor
but we're gonna analyze his
persuasiveness right
so in the following discussion
i am not concerned with whether
ivermectin works or does not work i'm
only going to talk about his
persuasiveness okay
and he says the ivormectin nonsense must
stop okay already a persuasion mistake
what is the persuasion mistake in the
first five words the ivermectin nonsense
must stop
he's not pacing
the people he's trying to convince
don't think it's nonsense so if you
start with calling it nonsense you've
already backed them into a corner you've
put the defensive shield up
you're done
you don't even need to write the rest of
it
because there's nothing that can happen
well
after you say the ivormectin nonsense
as soon as you've dismissed other
people's opinions as nonsense
they're going to stop listening to you
all right so he goes on he goes it is
literally killing people
those who have been peddling false cl
wait is it literally killing people
from the overdose
i don't know that the ivormectin is but
possibly the lack of vaccinations might
be what he's referring to
so i'm going to give him that one if he
if it means lack of vaccinations
and he says those who have been peddling
false claims of its enormous benefit
when the evidence is stating the
complete opposite
must be pressured by the media to
explain their ludicrous claims
all right here's the other problem
he says that the evidence is stating the
complete opposite
does it
in the comments is that a statement does
it ring as true to you
all right this is subjective
but does it ring true as you to you
that the evidence on ivermectin
is the complete opposite meaning that
the evidence completely shows it doesn't
work completely
how many of you agree with that
statement
none basically i'm looking at the
comments going by basically not
so pretty much none of you agree with
that statement
okay
um
that is a persuasion failure of epic
proportions because in order to convince
you and you're the ones that need to be
convinced because there are probably
more doubters here than in other places
he has to pace you
he has to find a way to agree with you
first
and then you say to yourself oh this is
a person who agrees with me
so far so good
and then once you get them to agree with
you you might be able to nudge them
somewhere
but until they know you're on the same
side
they're not going anywhere so if you
start out with ivermectin nonsense
you just took a team
and you guaranteed that the people
you're trying to persuade won't listen
to you guaranteed it right there
now let me um
so saying you're saying that the
evidence is stating the complete
opposite makes you look like a liar
even if you're right
right so remember persuasion is not
about what's true
it's about persuading people
and you this doctor could be completely
right that there's just
nothing to ivermectin
but if he's insulting people and telling
them that everything they believe is
wrong he's not going to get any
persuasion here's what he should have
done
all right let's say i wanted to persuade
you
to not take ivermectin i don't want to
persuade you of that by the way because
i'm not a doctor so i'm not going to
persuade you to take it or not to take
it and nothing i say here should be
construed as that right that's a doctor
problem talk to your doctor not me
but if i wanted to persuade you
here's how i do it
i would say
there are lots of studies
that show ivermectin works
that's pacing because you believe that
to be true right
i'm not saying it's true
i'm talking about persuasion you believe
it's true that there are lots of
randomized controlled trials 31 of them
actually
that's that indicate ivermectin works
plus
a whole bunch of observational trials
that collectively
say it works that's what you believe to
be true right
now whether or not that's true
here's how you would approach somebody
who believes that's true
you go like this
there are as you know
dozens
dozens of randomized controlled trials
that indicate ivermectin works
that's how you start
because everybody here just says okay
okay that's true
now i'm not saying it's true
i'm saying that's how i would try to
persuade you i would tell you it's true
because you think it's true
it might be true
might not be true but that's not
relevant here you think it's true so
therefore it's good persuasion
then i would say once i had you on my
team
yeah we're on the same team we know that
there's all these studies
and then i say but did you know
that if you remove the low quality
studies from that group
it reverses the
the outcome
how'd that feel
how'd that feel
when i agreed with you completely that
these studies exist
and you said yeah yeah now we're on the
same page but then i added something
that maybe you didn't know
that if you remove the low quality
studies from that group
it reverses the outcome
how many of you knew that
now that would persuade you wouldn't it
in the comments and and forget about
what's true for a moment okay again
we're only talking persuasion so it
doesn't matter if it's true that
removing those studies reverses it
i think it's true but it doesn't matter
to the point right
and i think it's true that there are
lots of randomized controlled trials
i think all those things are true
what is low quality somebody says yes
what is low quality well low quality
would be among other things a low
low number of people in the trial
or something about the controls that
weren't as perfect as they could have
been
maybe it's not as blind as it should
have been for example so it would be a
variety of things but people who
understand this world could fairly
easily pick out the low quality studies
um i think andres has done that uh
backhouse
so it's something that an economist
could do somebody who knows studies and
statistics could just look at him say
yeah i think i'd pick these ones out
now
would that make it a subjective process
as opposed to
science
yes
yes
if you're using your judgment
to decide what studies are credible
ah i'm not sure that's science is it
i mean it's not illogical
but it's not exactly science
it's it's a little bit judgy
now i'm not saying judgment is wrong
like you know i always support for
example
doctors using their judgment about what
to prescribe even if that
judgment disagrees with the mainstream
recommendations
so i think you can be judgey that's fine
you know you don't always have access to
perfect information so you have to make
your call
anyway that would be more persuasive
speaking of persuasion the cdc has a
video
trying to persuade you
to get a vaccination if you've recovered
from covent
in the comments
how many of you
think it's a good idea forget about the
fact that you need vaccinations to
travel and stuff like that assume that
nobody would care
do you think it's medically
a good idea to get a vaccination if
you've already recovered
in the comments you're not doctors so
it's just your opinion
almost all knows right no no no no no
everybody thinks it's a bad idea
so when the cdc says
yes you do need it
and they say the reason is this
because we don't know how long natural
immunity lasts
did that persuade you
so i'm adding some new information
you believe that natural immunity lasts
otherwise your answers will not look
like this right the reason that almost
all of you i think every one of you
that's answering this right now i think
every one of you is saying you don't
want the vaccination if you've already
recovered
but
suppose it was true
and i don't know if it's true but
suppose it's true that the smartest
people
don't know if that immunity will last
would that change your mind
depends on the timing but that's the ver
the point is that we don't know the
timing we don't know if it's going to
last a week or a month or a year right
well here's the problem
you know enough to know
that nobody's natural immunity has run
out yet
right is there even one example of
somebody whose natural immunity just
expired
unless they had some kind of you know
special medical problem
i don't know
it seems to me we've gone a year or so
and people still have pretty good
antibodies am i wrong about that
you know i'm not trying to spread
misinformation so fact-check me if
that's wrong
so here's the problem it's exactly the
same problem as the last example
the cdc is not
pacing you first
they're not pacing you first
they're telling you something that you
don't believe is true and they're not
really giving you a counter argument
because the uncertainty argument
applies to everything
do you know what else the cdc doesn't
know
if you wait two years after get
vaccinated if you if a problem could pop
up in two years
do they know that no of course not they
can't know it because it hasn't been two
years they
wouldn't be able to observe it
so when they tell you that you should
make a decision because there's one
thing that's uncertain
but they don't mention that all of the
other things are uncertain too
it's all uncertain
that you just look like a liar
if you say one thing's uncertain when
it's obvious that all the things are
uncertain
you just look like a freaking liar right
you would lose all credibility if you're
only treating one variable as uncertain
when they're all uncertain
so it's a terrible argument a terrible
argument what would be the better
argument
i don't know
because i don't know of a good argument
for this
i guess the best argument would be extra
is better
right now if the science shows
that natural immunity plus vaccination
gives you the the maximum amount of
antibodies and i think it does right
fact-check me on that but i think it
does
that's the argument
more antibodies is better
that's it
all right let's say i said to you
the higher your antibodies the less
problem you're going to have if you get
the covet and you're definitely going to
get coveted
all right how many of you think you're
definitely going to get covered even if
you're vaccinated because it's just
going to be around forever right
yeah most of you think you're going to
get covered i'm watching the responses
now if so so the first thing you do if
you're the cdc i'm trying to convince
you i'd say
you're probably going to get coveted
and then what's your first reaction to
that oh thank you you're finally being
honest
i'm probably going to get covered that's
exactly what i think
doesn't mean it's true
remember we're talking about persuasion
not truth
so now they have you
so now you've paced them
you're probably going to get coveted now
you have two possibilities you can get
covered with high antibodies
or covet with low antibodies those are
your only two choices
the cdc says you should get the highest
antibodies you can
to make your
odds the best
how's that argument
the higher your antibodies
the better you will do and you're
definitely going to get covered
that's not bad is it
judge judge my persuasion doesn't mean
it convinced you but just just judge it
it's not the same antibodies somebody
says but both are their additive
um
okay so i see some people agree now my
larger point is that the doctors and the
scientists are terrible
at persuasion just terrible and it's
really hurting us i think the country is
i think it's killing people
i think the inability of scientists and
medical people
to persuade with the correct form
correct form what what i'm teaching you
is not
um a natural ability
it's form
pace
and then lead it's just really basic
stuff
so they need to learn that stuff um
here's the other big problem that
i think the public is dealing with and
the
doctors and scientists are doing a
terrible job of sorting it out yes we're
going to the white board
going to the white board
all right so this is the part where some
of you will bail out
but you're gonna wish you didn't
you're gonna wish you didn't
all right
how do you make decisions when there are
so many
what do you do
well it's tough i'm going to give you
some little rules about how to make a
decision with bendy unknowns
this is not to persuade you
it's how to make a decision with
unknowns
see you hunter
um i think you hunter i think you would
be happier to see this one you should
probably stay for this one
all right here's the idea let's say
there's vaccination risk and there's
unvaccinated risk
if you if you get vaccinated the odds of
having a bad side effect
is probably less than one percent
it's probably
way less than one percent
but would everybody agree it's less than
one percent
based on what we know
not based on what we don't know because
everything's possible but based on what
we know
uh side effects usually happen early
so the longer you wait the less chance
there's going to be any more of them
but would you say less than one percent
all right let's just go with it for now
the odds of uh getting covered and dying
if you're vaccinated is also way under
one percent it's like way under one
percent okay
likewise the unvaccinated risk what is
the risk of long hull
don't know
i'm not even sure it's real
are you
i mean the the risk of long-haul coven
might be zero
but it might be 25 percent
that that's the range we've actually
seen i don't know if anybody's going
over 25 i saw some 30 but i think 25 to
zero is is the range of uncertainty
i think zero is pretty unlikely
but 20 25 seems unlikely to so it's
probably somewhere in the middle of that
range
just guessing
all right so let's say you accept this
i'm just working through the logic of
decision making you can put in your own
uh put in your own numbers later but
wait for the big reveal there there's a
point that i'm working up to and if you
haven't heard it yet it's worth it
uh one of the odds of if you're
unvaccinated with the odds of getting
covered and just dying
well let's say is what less than one
percent because you're not an old person
and you don't have too many
comorbidities
all right here's
my tip
ignore everything under one percent
because we confuse group risk with
individual risk
this is the big point
when
when the government is trying to do its
job which type of risk does it look at
individual risk
or
group risk it has to look at group risk
because if you're the president and you
cause one percent of your public to die
and you lose 3.6 million people that
maybe didn't need to die
you're fired
you're very fired
but
if you individually as just an
individual decide to take a chance a one
in 100 chance you know something will go
wrong and you decide to take that chance
and then let's say something goes wrong
you die
you're still thinking you you lived the
life you wanted to
and there aren't many of you so here is
my advice to you
everything under one percent
like it doesn't exist
for the individual risk the one you make
when you decide to wear a mask when you
decide to get vaccinated those are your
personal risks
but
understand that the government
has to look at the whole and that's a
whole different calculation they can't
lose 3.6 million people
and keep their jobs
right
so
um
oh youtube needs a little
adjustment there you go
let me get away from the board for a
second and
straighten you both out
so you can see it
all right so the
um i'm not trying to convince you to get
vaccinated or not vaccinated because i'm
not a doctor and i don't do that it
would be immoral and unethical for me to
do that but
the only thing i'm going to add
is that
every risk that's under one percent
that you as an individual
should treat at zero
you got that because if you're trying to
make a decision because you think
the the this risk is ten times this risk
but they're both under one percent
you're you're not being rational
because you really can't tease out those
differences for you specifically
you can only tease out those differences
for large groups you don't know what
your risk is you just know you're in
this under one percent range that's all
you know
so just treat it all as zero
and the only one that might be bigger
is the long haul
and the long haul could be zero too
but at least the odds are it's bigger
than that
so that's the only thing you should look
at are things that are greater than one
percent
does anybody disagree with me
let me see in the comments
if you track with this thinking
the and the only part of it that i want
you to agree or disagree with
as an individual
can you ignore every risk under one
percent can't see the damn board
yeah let me fix that for you
i'm gonna let the locals people get a
clearer look
at that
all right um well it looks it looks like
i made my case so
you know i've told you before that um i
rest my decision on only whether the
long haul is likely to be real or not
um
my guess is that it's real
but it's not a scientific
you know basis it's just a guess
and i think that um
my argument is unclear
really
fern law so i assume you're a lawyer and
you think this argument is unclear
let me summarize it
for a personal decision which is
different from what a government decides
about the whole but for your personal
decision you should ignore every risk
under one percent
that's it that's the whole argument
right
fern law do you disagree with the
statement you should ignore an
individual
not the government government makes
different decisions but an individual
should ignore every risk under one
percent
that's
not much to argue with there
i mean maybe you could say it's under
0.1
or something but
one percent seems still seems kind of
high does it
one percent
i don't know
because remember these things are well
under one percent
we're talking about the risk of dying
driving to the store you know you're
down in that range
uh
personal risk could be higher if you
have yeah comorbidities that's right so
this would be the the framework and then
you would adjust it for your own
specific situation
all right that is all i have to talk
about
today
that's right your own data makes it 27.4
less risky
i know what excellent comic you read
today
all right
um and that
is the show for today
youtube
all you watchers thank you for joining i
think i'm going to be on uh rumble
pretty soon i did get a response on that
so i think i've gotta tweak a few things
and then i can i can be live streaming
on rumble as well i hope i have enough
wi-fi to do that
and i will talk to you
tomorrow
you
