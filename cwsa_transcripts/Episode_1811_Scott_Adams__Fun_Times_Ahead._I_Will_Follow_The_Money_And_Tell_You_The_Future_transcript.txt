good morning everybody
whoa let me put my
microphone on you can hear me and
everything
there you go there you go
it's all better now now
the book was called the religion war
that's an answer to the people on locals
who asked the question
but that's not why you're here you're
here because this is the highlight of
civilization
every single day and today nothing but
optimism
can you handle it
can you handle nothing but good news
it's going to be like that we have
entered
the golden age
and if you'd like to take it up a notch
and
join the dimension of
people vibrating just right all you need
is a copper mug or a glass of time
hold on
take here from the top
all you need is a copper mug or glasses
to take your chance to find a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine today
i think makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous
sip
and it's amazing it's going to happen
now
go
well i was telling the people on the
locals platform before you joined here
on youtube and spotify
that uh well first of all i saw a news
story that drinking three cups of coffee
will make you live longer
i haven't read it but
since the headline agrees with me
good enough
that's the way i evaluate studies
if you're trying to figure out which
scientific studies to trust
here's a good tip
trust the ones that
confirm your suspicions
and reject everything else that's how i
do it it's called science
well what i was going to talk about is
uh
i wrote a book back in 2004
at least that's when it was published
there was a prequel
to my book god's debris
now some of you are saying oh my
favorite topic
and others of you others of you are
saying
god's debris that's a weird book i never
knew a cartoonist wrote a book named
that
well if you don't know what i'm talking
about
it was written in 2001 god's debris was
and is still a worldwide phenomenon
it's just that
there's a certain type of person who's
reading it and has ever since it came
out and and they formed almost like a
secret society at this point like the
people who who have read that book
and and they they talk to me about it
all the time it's one of the biggest
topics in my life
this is weird probably if you if you're
if you're familiar with my work
it would probably sound weird to you
that one of the biggest topics people
talk to me about has nothing to do with
dilbert nothing to do with politics or
trump or any of that stuff
it's a little book i wrote in 2001
called god's debris
now it can't be described uh
you'd have to you'd have to look into it
it's it's beyond description but here's
the funny part
i wrote a prequel
because god's debris did so well
and it got very little notice i don't
remember why maybe i didn't
promote it or something
and i called it a sequel but it was
actually a prequel
and i hadn't read it for 15 years myself
so when erica uh so nicely sent me a
copy of my own book because i didn't
have a copy
i wanted to look at it but i didn't have
a copy
and so
so erica sent me a copy of my own book
and i started reading it yesterday
and uh
it is way way stronger than it was in
2004
and the reason is that
it held a number of predictions about
what was going to happen
and the predictions are close enough to
reality that it's going to freak you out
it freaked me out just reading because i
didn't remember all the things i'd done
and as i read it i thought oh jeez
its relevance just increased
so i might read it
i don't know i have the digital rights
to it so i might read it into
youtube or locals or something at some
point
um
that was self-indulgent that had nothing
to do with you whatsoever why would you
come here to listen to me talk about
myself
here's the coolest news of the day
nasa's perseverance rover
they've got a really clear picture of
something that's sitting on the mars
surface
right by the rover
and it's a bundle of string
wait
what
no seriously it's a real a very clear
picture of a bundle of string
i'm not making that up
and do you know what nasa said was the
uh
the explanation
the explanation was it was some kind of
debris that fell off
the uh
the the rover itself
and so they say it's something about you
know the device itself
now
i'm no
engineer but i'm trying to think
what could possibly fall off a
spacecraft
that is also string
was there some point during the building
of the rover where they said
we've been using rivets for this
we've been using rivets
but on this one component i think we
should wrap it
with a string
how in the world is there any string
as part of the rover
please can anybody explain
how string is part of any part of this
here's my theory
as you know the
the moon landing was faked uh with
puppets
most of you know that by now right the
moon landing never really happened in
1969 that was faked with puppets
it was actually an elaborate puppet show
and now i think we're seeing evidence
that uh the mars rover is not real
it's never been real
clearly it's just another puppet show
and one of the strings fell off the
puppets
and then got captured on camera and now
they're doing this
they're doing this scramble you know
nasa's like god what are we going to do
they got our string
and so now they're trying to sell you
that
some of your finest mars missions
do involve string as part of an
important part of the engineering
so
note 2 elon musk no tli musk if you're
building rockets to colonize mars
and you have no string
well maybe you should work on better
materials because this string made it
all the way to mars
it's good strength
so there's that story
are you noticing that there's a sort of
a
oh let's say a gap or something missing
in the headlines of some of the news but
not all of it
because i looked on fox news and i saw
this
fairly what i would consider
pretty major story of importance
and then i looked for it in other news
sources i didn't see it i didn't see it
now see if you could come up with any
kind of a theory
why this story which i believe is true
looks like a true story
why would it only be on fox news
here's the story
there was some kind of a shooting
incident not too long ago in an indiana
mall
and
there was a fellow named elisha dickens
who was in the restroom when it all
started
and he happened to be armed
so he was just a
customer at the mall he did not have
military or police training
but he was armed i guess he had a
concealed weapon
and he steps out of the the restroom to
find that there's a shooting in progress
from a distance i didn't hear what the
distance was
from a distance
this guy put 8 out of 10 shots into the
shooter with a pistol
from distance
i don't know what the distance was
but you don't have to get too far away
so somebody said 40 or 50 yards
50 yards
are you serious
40 yards
all right trying to visualize that
100 yards is a football field right
so
40 yards of a hundred yard football
field do you think you could shoot
somebody eight out of ten times
from 40 yards
somebody says feet
i don't think it was feet
if it was feet he would have been out
gunned right because the guy had
two rifles and stuff
40 yards all right but it was a good
distance
but here's the thing
apparently this guy was tactically
correct like he was he was getting
bystanders behind him and he was close
he closed he actually closed on the
shooter
and here's the fun part
he neutralized the shooter with 8 out of
10 bullets into the body of the shooter
in 15 seconds
it took him 15 seconds
to leave the restroom
assess the risk properly
assess the risk properly
and neutralize it in 15 seconds
oh my god
now
how republican was he
i mean it's not reported
nobody reported his political leanings
but
how republican was he
am i right
i mean if we find out it was a democrat
i will i will publicly
you know
embarrass myself by saying well no
that was i was totally wrong but if that
guy isn't a republican i'll be amazed
i'll be amazed and so i tweeted that the
safest place in america is next to an
armed republican
that's true isn't it
the safest place in america
is near a armed republican
now
now i suppose the i suppose january 6
was a glaring exception to that
but generally speaking
you couldn't be safer than next to an
armed republican
so i mean that's a real thing
all right um
here's a hypothetical question for you
yeah i don't think this is going to
happen but just hypothetically
let's say trump runs for reelection and
he wins with 75 percent of the popular
vote again it's not going to happen this
is not a prediction
but what if he did
you know let's say the other candidate
had some scandal or whatever it was just
like it was just a blowout
at the end of the election with if trump
got 75 of the vote you think the
democrats would say
wow good race
nicely done
or do you think that they would say that
the election was rigged what do you
think
do you think they'd say it was rigged
despite having no court
certified
evidence
i believe they would
now let us predict the future shall we
what is the most likely outcome of trump
and 2024 the most likely outcome is that
he runs right
i'm not predicting it yet
because i think things could go either
way still
but probably trump runs right
probably he runs that's the most likely
if he runs what is most likely to happen
in terms of who wins
he'll probably win
don't you think
i think he'll probably run and he'll
probably win
now what would the democrats say if that
happens the most probable outcome
they're going to say the election was
rigged aren't they
and they're not going to have any court
approved evidence of it
and
i don't know how much i'm going to enjoy
this
but i'm already getting ready for it
like i don't know if there's a movie or
a tv show i've ever wanted to watch more
than the day after the 2024 election
when the democrats are screaming that
the election was rigged
and they need more transparency and they
need just a little bit more time to run
some audits
how much are you going to enjoy
that it'll be glorious
you remember elon musk said and i've
said it as well
that there for some reason reality tends
to trend toward the most entertaining
outcome not to the participants but to
the observers
can you imagine a more entertaining
outcome than trump reclaiming the
presidency and the democrats claiming
the election was rigged i can't
i can't not only would it be the most
entertaining
it's also the most likely
probably there's a solid
60 chance that exact scenario will
happen don't you think
would you go with me at 60
if you take the entire chain of
probability from
trump probably running
probably getting the nomination
probably winning the general election
probably the democrats will say it was
rigged
am i wrong
there's at least a 60 chance that we're
going to get the most entertaining
outcome
it's not even i wouldn't even say it's
what i want
but it's the most entertaining
we already have video of them saying it
about the 2016 election right so we know
that we know that the democratic about
2016 what would stop him from saying it
about the next election nothing
so entertainment here we come it's
coming
well
um
as i've taught you you can predict the
future by following the
money follow the money and here's
something that you should have seen
coming
and you should continue to see coming it
goes like this i heard professor scott
galloway talk about this first
but it's also kind of a general math
based business concept it goes like this
if you're a big company
just like every company that's public
you have sort of an obligation to grow
right if you have stockholders they're
kind of expecting you to grow
so in order to grow
if you're a small company
any new market you get into will help
you grow
but if you're an enormous company like
amazon or apple
you can't just say oh i think we'll make
keychains
because
all the keychains in the world wouldn't
make you enough money to you know move
your big numbers because you're starting
with such a big number
so you have to enter markets that are
already gigantic
and there aren't that many gigantic
markets left
there's education
you know which the the private sector
has not really gone big on education but
it's guaranteed because it's such a big
market one of the big companies has to
take it on
self-driving cars
all of the big companies have to be
there
they all have to because it's one of the
few things that's so big
that it could move their their their
numbers
but the other thing is healthcare
the the big companies that are not in
healthcare
almost have to get into it because
that's where the money is there's
nothing else that has enough money
flowing around that they can they can
really improve their their top revenue
number
and so we see exactly what you would
predict so the scott galloway
prediction that big companies have to
enter big markets they have no choice
they literally have no choice
so if you wonder it was amazon going to
go big in the health care market
yes
yes turns out they just bought
they bought a big health care provider
for 3.9 billion one medical
so they're a primary care provider so
that's we're talking about the actual
doctor who touches you
so amazon
and and but the thing that caught my
attention is the way amazon
phrased this
and by the way if you're not catching
this this is one of the biggest stories
in the world
it just doesn't have that
people dying part of it you know there's
nobody dying
so you know it doesn't look like a big
story
but it's big
this is really big
let me let me just say the way amazon's
representative described it
quote we think healthcare is high on the
list
of experiences that need reinvention oh
here it comes
booking an appointment
waiting weeks or even months to be seen
taking time off work driving to a clinic
finding a parking spot waiting in the
waiting room then the exam room for what
is too often a rushed few minutes with a
doctor then making another trip to a
pharmacy
and
they continue we see lots of
opportunities to both improve the
quality of the experience of give back
time
this is from sb the amazon's svp
neil lindsey
now
is that exactly what you want to hear
from your big american company
that is exactly
that is exactly what i wanted to hear i
because they didn't
she didn't even say cost
she didn't even say cost
or he he didn't even say cost
um
it was about the experience being
completely broken
and how often have you had a
conversation i've i had two of them this
week where some just basic health health
care stuff couldn't get done
no three of them i think i've been in
three conversations this week
yeah just this week three of them where
the where just the process of getting
healthcare was just so broken
that a consumer who is paying for it
couldn't get a basic feature
just the most basic thing
and you're paying for it like the whole
system is pretty up right now and
the expensive yes but that's not even
the big problem the big problem is i
can't get it
the big problem
oh okay
depends who you are if you have money
the big problem isn't the cost
so you can't get it
like i i struggle
at my income level to get basic health
care coverage
services i have to fight for it
like i have kaiser you know it's a hmo
and they have set a rules
and sometimes the rules work well
but lots of times they don't
they don't work for me or other people
so i'm like fighting for health care
that i pay for
like what are you what are the rest of
you doing right i mean i'm in a
privileged situation i have money i've
got health care right best situation you
can be in and i've got to fight for it
like they don't they don't just say
here's some health care do you want it
no i got to fight for it
i got to change policies i got to get
exceptions i get to get a doctor's
approval
what are the rest of you doing
i mean jesus seriously
i mean i'm in the best situation i can
barely get health care it seems like
even when i pay for it so when i see
amazon saying this thing is just messed
up we're going to go fix this
the first thing i say is
who better
seriously
who better
no nobody better amazon is the very best
company you'd want to see doing this now
apple too apparently is also
announced they've got a 60 page white
paper detailing how the
the apple watch will be connected to
their health care
efforts so apple is going also big into
health care
who better
who better right amazon right amazon and
apple just going big on health care if
you don't think this is the biggest
story in the world it's bigger than
it's bigger than everything
it's just there's all good news and
nobody died from it so you're not going
to hear much about it
so that's all changing
good news
so apparently there's even cnn is
reporting now they're not making a big
deal of it but on their page they are
reporting
that uh the cat is on the roof when it
comes to hunter biden and various
charges
that would include let's see
so they're still being talked about
charges that would include tax
violations maybe
false statements and connections with
buying of firearms
blah blah and so we don't know if
there'll be any charges for that but the
investigators
uh i guess the government has sort of a
unwritten rule that they don't like to
uh
interfere in politics
so
the fbi for example
would be less inclined to prosecute
hunter biden while there's an election
coming you know they might want to wait
so it doesn't bias the election
to which i say
wait a minute
isn't this supposed to buy us the
election
that this is not the bias you're
supposed to remove
is it
i feel like this is the bias you're
supposed to insert
does it not make the election let's say
more credible
for us to have more information about
what
joe biden did or did not do regarding
china
wouldn't you like to know if your
current president is owned by china
or do you think it would be good to wait
i wonder if my current president
is in the pocket of china there sure is
a lot of evidence that he made some
deals that would just make you suspect
that china has some pretty good
blackmail material on the president of
the united states but you know what you
should do with that most important
information that you could ever have
about your president
how about
weight uh
let's wait a few years see how it plays
out
what kind of rule is that
like i i get the general rule that you
don't want to prosecute and influence
the elections i get that so and i get
why they they would wait to try to go
after trump for example
now if we were talking about the
president himself
maybe
i'd say maybe wait
but the president's son
what exactly is the reason for waiting
on that
i'm not so sure that makes sense does it
um
anyway
um and uh cnn reporter reveals there's
new details
but they also point out that the
republicans are definitely going to look
into this hunter biden stuff when they
get power which they probably will
so do you think that maybe the democrats
want to make sure that the investigation
of hunter
is com complete before the republicans
get power
and do it right
see where i'm going
if you're going to cover this thing up
you need to get through the entire
process and finish it before the
republicans come to power
so what you might be seeing is the
democrats
trying to strategize how to handle this
and
discount it before the election
and they mean they may need to handle it
themselves before the republicans do it
because republicans aren't going to be
so kind
yeah i think it's going to be a quick
role that's right
you all saw the story yesterday that joe
biden announced he has cancer
now cancer isn't funny
except that i don't think he has cancer
so that's funny all right
how much did you laugh about that i
couldn't stop tweeting about it because
it was just funny
and
so let's let's start with does he have
cancer
i don't think so
i don't think so does anybody think he
actually has cancer and that and that he
is slipped out it could is it very
possible
like i wouldn't rule that out
but i doubt it well pros prostate
doesn't count everybody's age has
prostate cancer
you almost don't count that one because
that's like a slow grower
skin stuff blah blah yeah
all right so here's my prediction
my prediction is he doesn't have a
deadly cancer at the moment
does anybody disagree
but he definitely said it he said it in
clear words but it looked like he just
maybe mixed up something he was reading
on the teleprompter something like that
and then the white house tries to cover
it up by saying it had to do with his
past
non-malignant skin cancer stuff being
pre-cancerous stuff being removed
as if that's what he was talking about
and it was when there was oil on his
windshield from the
every part of this story was hilarious
like
and i was
as i tweeted
imagine the story if trump had made that
that little flurb you know i think it
was just a speaking
misstep
imagine if trump had done that
and imagine if part of the story had
been the oil on his windshield
the news would have said
that trump claims he got cancer by
licking his windshield
that's what to say they say trump got
cancer from licking his windshield he
claims
that's what they would have said
yeah
but they got a different treatment
all right so uh
kudos to rand paul and cory booker who
apparently are joining forces with a
couple other lawmakers who i will say
their names because i'm going to
compliment them too
let's see it's uh
also with representatives earl
blumenauer democrat
and
nancy mace republican
so these four are
adding to some existing legislation
uh laws giving seriously seriously ill
patients access to schedule one drugs
including marijuana and psychedelics
like psilocybin and mdma
now
thank you
just thank you
all right so cory booker somebody he
said i have mixed feelings about cory
booker
i don't think he's quite present
material
but he's pretty awesome in a lot of ways
and
yeah i mean
and i think this is a case
where rand paul and cory booker are just
doing something for the country what do
you think
it's hard it's hard for me to see this
as a political positive for either one
of them
like i love him i love him for doing it
so but i don't know that this would
overall help them
in an electoral way
i don't feel like either of them is
going to be bragging that up as part of
their accomplishments because there are
too many people who are scared of
the whole drug related space i don't see
this as being
politically motivated
am i wrong i mean maybe that's naive
that everything's politically motivated
because they're politicians
but this just doesn't have the smell of
it does it i mean for one thing it's
bipartisan
right
um
so am i right that we could
um
can you turn on slow mode i don't know
what that means
um
is there a slow mode for the comments
is that what you're saying
is that a thing i'm just looking at
youtube somebody said turn on slow mode
do the comments have a slow mode i don't
think that's a thing is it
it's not a feature is it
yes maybe all right i'll look into that
um
but i would just like to say publicly
thank you to
cory booker and rand paul and
mason blumenauer because to me it looks
like they're doing a non-political thing
that is simply good for the world
and probably i'm just guessing
i'll bet they all had some personal
experience
with something some loved one some
family relative or something because
this looks legitimate to me
when was the last time i said here's a
story in the news where everybody's
acting
appropriately
they're acting according to science
they're bipartisan and they're just
doing something that's good for america
when was the last time i told you that
ever
ever
so
let's give these guys a big hand now i
don't even know if they'll be successful
if they're if their
attempt at legislation will get through
i don't know but the fact that they're
even doing this
is like you know big standing ovation
for both of them all four of them
actually
all right um somebody came after me on
twitter again for you know allegedly
defending bill gates but i but here's
the only thing i'm going to defend
i don't defend his personal life that's
up to him
i just i can't stand
people telling me he's in it for the
money
i just can't handle it because that's so
obviously not true that i just don't
know what to do it just makes my head
explode what could be more obviously not
true
that he's not in it for the money he's
developing toilets for africa do you
think that was like at the at the top of
his making money list
don't think so he's literally giving his
money away
do you think he has has anybody ever
made money through massive philanthropy
can you think of one example
where somebody gave away his money
aggressively and made money because of
it
no
please stop saying that he's in it for
the money
now others are saying he's in it for the
power
i don't know
it doesn't look like it
if bill gates was in it for the power
is this the way he'd do it
is that the way you do it if you're the
re at some point he was like richest
person in america do you think the
richest person in america
would try to get power
by inventing toilets for africa
that's how he's doing that
trying to
cure malaria
i don't think so
i think he would just buy politicians
the way anybody else does
wouldn't he you would just buy a
politician and i'm not have you ever
heard that bill gates owns a particular
politician
there are a lot of people who are owned
by billionaires but i haven't heard him
owning one he's like the only name i
haven't heard in that context
i i don't think it could be more obvious
that he's not in it for the money
and look at the way he presents himself
in public
do you think his interest isn't looking
good to you
is there anything about the way bill
gates operates that tells you that his
real interest is how you think of him
everything suggests it's the opposite
he does he doesn't he doesn't even dress
or exercise or
present himself in any way
this suggests he he's like really
interested in the narcissistic
perceptions of himself
now what about philanthropy in general
do you think he's doing philanthropy
because it's you know rehabilitating him
and that's the reason he's doing it
i don't know i can't read his mind
but i will tell you that he said
way before he became a philanthropist he
said that the second part of his life
was going to be giving away his money
and then he did it
and he would be probably one of the most
effective
philanthropist because he puts in the
work to figure out where the money makes
the most difference
now
why is it that anybody hates him and
what do you think he would do if he
bought up a bunch of farmland
there is no there is no scenario in
which he can make money from the things
he's doing
like
one exception would be nuclear energy
i do believe that he could make money in
gen 4 nuclear energy if that's the thing
that takes off
but he's not really the guy who would
make that kind of play
that would just be one of his
investments he's got to be doing that
for social reasons
right
if
it wouldn't make sense to put that much
money in one company i don't think
if he were betting on nuclear in general
he'd probably spread his money around
maybe he has i don't know
but
for power issues
so what what
if you think that
if you think the gates is going for
power
like his own personal power
then you have to explain why he's doing
it the wrong way
and it would be obvious what the right
way is which is just buy some
politicians
fund some organizations the usual way
does soros you know you don't see george
soros inventing any toilets for africa
right
he doesn't need to
he just buys organizations
so
if you told me that
bill gates funded some organization
and through it he wanted power i'd say
well look at that
but if you look at the whole portfolio
of what he's doing there isn't
okay let's say ego
let's say bill gates is doing it for ego
do you have a problem with that
oh i cured malaria but i don't get any
credit because i just did it to look
good
no that's not how it works
you let him get that credit
you know you i i labeled myself a uh
grandiose narcissist there are a couple
different kinds of narcissists there's
one that's just all bad
the grandiose kind is just trying to get
credit for doing good stuff
but they actually try to do good stuff
they're not just lying
they're trying to actually do some good
stuff
so when you see me trying to you know
take any credit for something it's
because i'm trying to do some good stuff
right
that's not a crime
all right
um so i will publicly debate anybody who
wants to embarrass themselves
by saying that they know so little about
how business works that they think what
bill gates is doing the the portfolio of
what he's doing is to make money
you would have
let me challenge you to this i challenge
you to find anybody with an mba
who holds that opinion
somebody who has a master's in business
somebody understands business models how
to make money
here's your challenge find anybody with
an mba so that would suggest a lot of
business
education at least if not experience
find anybody with an mba who agrees with
you that he's in it for the money
and if you say the tax write-offs you
really need to talk to somebody who
knows what business is
no you can't make money on tax
write-offs
you can only lose less
you can't make money with tax write-offs
that's not a thing
all right
uh
so uh the panda tribune a twitter
account you should probably follow so
just look for the panda tribune
did a cool analysis of musk and his
purchase of twitter
and what his best options are and what
and the bottom line is that musk is
playing this correctly
so his his backing out of the deal
and then going to court over it etc
is the right play
no matter how it turns out so he's
played the odds correctly and here's the
argument
let's say that
let's say that musk has to pay the one
billion dollar breakup fee
it's still better than buying a company
that used to be worth you know he was
going to pay 54 billion but now it's
worth only 44 billion the stock price
so it's better to to lose a billion
than to waste all that difference
between what it's actually worth
and what he was actually going to pay
you know 10 billion or so
so it definitely makes sense to walk
away
but
here's the thing that's that the panda
tribune adds
and i've i've always believed this would
be the obvious way things would go but i
don't think i've ever said it
so tell me if i've ever said this in
public
the
the leaders of twitter have a fiduciary
responsibility to get the best deal for
twitter
they can't walk away from the best deal
if there's only one mark if there's only
one offer for twitter and it's musk
nobody else is offering that's important
if there's only one offer
and he says he's going to walk away and
pay the billion dollars he hasn't said
that but if he did
what should the twitter leadership do
to
do their best job for the stockholders
they should renegotiate the purchase
price
and they should try to get something
that's between the 54 that he offered
that he's walking away from
and the 44
that it's worth so if twitter is smart
they'll make him an offer that's
somewhere in the middle
he will have saved let's say five
billion dollars
by not paying the highest price
they will have done better than they
could have done before
biden has covered
somebody's shouting the biden has
covered that's not a news event is it
that's just somebody shouting that
oh it's a new oh it's just announced
oh okay
huh
so biden has covered
i don't know if that means anything
i mean even at his age he'll probably be
fine right
he's all boosted and whatever
interesting all right well we'll find
out more about that
um
so anyway it looks at this point that
the most likely if you follow the money
the most likely outcome is that twitter
and musk will walk away from the current
deal
but they will keep negotiating because
there might be
a price where they can make the deal
but i don't know that they'll ever be
able to make the deal unless they reveal
their bot traffic
so maybe maybe a future deal would have
more uh
more teeth than about proving the bots
or something
but the bottom line is that musk will uh
will come out ahead by walking out of
the deal
like under every scenario musk comes out
ahead by challenging the deal even if he
loses a billion dollars it's better than
the alternative
um
so it looks like trump is going to be
hit with some uh rupaur videos today by
the january six people and by that i
mean outtakes that don't show the full
context and here's how
here's how cnn is trying to frame this
in advance so they're they're prepping
you for this
so uh so adam schiff and you know all
the usual people that you don't trust
uh are saying oh this is going to be
really bad where do you see these
outtakes
and what they're saying is that there'll
be significant quote
um
i think schiff said this significant in
terms of what the president was willing
to say and what he wasn't willing to say
what's that mean
so you're going to be shocked by this
bombshell
this shift tells you will be significant
okay that's general
in terms of what the president was
willing to say and what he wasn't
willing to say in other words
they have video of him saying things he
wanted to say
but they don't have video of him saying
the things he didn't want to say
i think he said nothing right
it would be significant that's general
uh because of he wanted to say things
and
what
so if you read this quickly it sounds
like he's telling you that there's a
bombshell coming but if you read the
actual words there's nothing there
there's just nothing there
and here's what's going to happen
they're going to show these and here's
what they're warning us we will see on
these outtakes
you're going to see trump arguing that
he wants to characterize the january six
protesters as patriots
oh no
i didn't see that coming
bombshell
that's right
trump wanted to characterize the
protests as patriots
because
that's what they are
they could be wrong
they could be wrong
about why they were there
but
they were patriots they are
even the ones in jail
even the ones that got violent
they were violent they need to they need
to answer for that
but they were patriots
that was the only reason anybody was
there was being a patriot there was no
other reason no other reason it was just
that
and and cnn's reporting that that's like
suspicious
that's kind of suspicious that you think
all the patriots are called patriots why
would you call the patriots patriots
suspicious
um the other thing the other bombshell
is that uh
what is it
there was some other claim that was like
as innocuous as that
uh
all right whatever it is but there
there are going to be two claims that
are absolutely empty
but they're selling us they're
gaslighting us that something's
happening while proving that to us
simultaneously that nothing's happening
they're going to show us nothing
and then talk about it
like it was something
and it will work
because it just worked right in front of
you adam schiff just talked about
literally nothing
but made it sound like you saw something
oh my god the bombshell
oh as regarding the thing about the
significance of the importance of the
bombshell of the shocking news
only all they've done is that they've
got rid of all the content now and all
they do is the shocking words
okay mr schiff can you give us your read
on today's events
well it's a shocking
shocking news of a significant event
it's going to be a bombshell
i think you'll be shocked and appalled
at the bombshell shocking events that
are significant
all the content is gone
all the content is gone
and
and they can still sell it without the
content
because it was never about the content
it wasn't
if you could sell it without the content
well i should tell you something
it was always about the feeling it was
never the content
all right
um
here's some new news
my favorite story of the day
uh 53 this is a rasmussen poll
uh 53 percent of democrat voters say uh
hillary clinton should not run for
president again in 2024.
now you know you would not be surprised
that republicans and independents agree
by a larger number but 53 percent of
democrats don't want hillary clinton
okay
but is it worse
yes it's worse than that
cnn reports
and by far this is the most entertaining
part of the news like you wouldn't
notice it unless you dug in a little bit
to get the really funny part
but this is cnn's reporting
uh they have their own poll
in which they say the biggest shifts
are that democrats and
independents uh
stopped believing in the credibility of
our elections
now let me say that again you probably
said did you think i misspoke
that since 2021
there's been a big shift in the public's
belief about the credibility of the
elections
the shift is that democrats went from
largely believing elections were
credible
to not
to democrats did you think i said it
wrong again
did you think i said republi you did you
think i meant republicans when i said
that no let me say it again clearly
democrats
i'll give you the numbers
in early 2021 this is cnn's reporting
remember this is important this is cnn
all right
in early 2021 90 of democrats said they
were at least somewhat confident that
elections reflected the will of the
people
uh what in one year
they went from 90 democrats saying that
the
the elections were valid what do you
think that is now for democrats
did you think i misspoke
and said when i met republicans no i'm
only talking democrats only democrats
went from 90 thinking they trusted the
election to currently
57 percent
57
democrats
in one year
democrats went from 90 trusting their
own election
to 57 percent and they won
they won the election
did i mention that they won
and they went from 90
i don't even know what to say about this
what do you think
[Music]
i have a hypothesis
and it goes like this
the january 6
hearings are making democrats trust
elections less
i'll tell you why
it's a hypnosis theory and they have not
thought this through
they did not think it through
let me give you an example
you've heard this example before
don't think of an elephant right now
don't do it
don't do it don't think of an elephant
do not think of a giant pachyderm with
big ears and a trunk
that's my elephant impression don't do
it
how did you do
did you succeed in not thinking about
that elephant okay so the first the
first rule of hypnosis is
you can't not think about things
if it's in your face you're thinking
about it
you can't unthink things so that's the
first rule
thinking's automatic
second rule is
your opinion of what matters
is what you hear about the most
not because it matters the most
what you think matters the most is just
what you hear about
i keep hearing about that that must
matter doesn't matter what did the
january 6 hearings do
well the logical point of them was to
make a logical case
that republicans are bad people
you know that's the there was a
political show trial still is
but that's a
concept
do people remember concepts
yeah i mean
if you give them a test on it later they
might get the right answer
but they really remember how you make
them feel
and so this is what the january 6
event has done
those elections were not rigged
the elections were not rigged
the elections were not stolen
all of those many many many claims of
evidence of elections are not real
those two thousand mules didn't go to
those drop boxes
all you heal all you hear is that the
elections are sketchy
no matter how many times they tell you
that the republicans are wrong or lying
about the elections
what you hear is
why are we talking about elections being
sketchy
or what we're still talking about
elections being sketchy right
i just woke up today and it's a new day
and democrats are still talking about
elections being
sketchy
now the concept is they're blaming other
people
but it feels like
all they're talking about is elections
being unreliable
now here's the payoff
what happened to republican opinion
about the reliability of the 2020
election or elections in general i think
it's elections in general
republican confidence in the elections
went up
in the same period
republican confidence in the elections
went up
in the same period
it went from low right it was 23 percent
were confident after the trump
experience in
2020
but it's up to 29
so republicans have watched the same
news
and
by a smaller margin but they've come to
be convinced okay maybe we're in better
shape than i thought
right because the news showed the
republicans that no courts had found
anything and time goes by and you know
all these crazy kraken claims didn't
come through
some number of republicans just said
well you know i had my questions but
maybe i'll release on that for now
so am i am i wrong that that's the best
hypothesis for what's happening because
i don't know what else would be
happening
if if cnn is non-stop in msnbc non-stop
telling their base that the elections
are fine
how do you explain it
how do you how do you explain that
gigantic drop in confidence of the
democrats when their own side just keeps
telling them everything is fine
it's got to be the hypnotist thing right
it's got to be just that the topic
itself
is poison
because you can't talk about election
fraud
all day long and then not and then have
people think there is none
so the entire thing is about look at all
this smoke
oh look at all this smoke there's no
fire there oh look at this other smoke
well it's very smoky it's very smoky but
every time we look for the source of the
smoke it's not there but did i tell you
how smoky it is well there's another
another smoke oh there's some more smoke
but so far all the smoke we found is
nothing but boy there's a lot of smoke
am i selling my point
i don't know that this is what's going
on but it looks like they sold the
opposite of what they were selling
right
[Laughter]
at least at least you have to throw my
hypothesis into the mix
at the very least
it's a high possibility
that this worked just the way it should
have worked
if you had asked me what would be the
likely outcome of this and somehow you
could describe it to me before it
happened
i would have said whoa
i don't know if you want to spend so
much time talking about the thing you
said didn't happen
right
why does russia collusion persist
russia collusion persists in the minds
of democrats not because they followed
the
followed the case and found that it
wasn't true
they still believe it because they heard
it so many times that's it
if you say russia collusion enough times
it doesn't matter if the outcome was
there was none
it matters that you heard it a lot so
why would that be any different
the the democrats are basically a herded
a lot machine
you say the same thing over and over
again and they just hear it
right
so the problem with the
allegations of the
election rigging
are that the people making the
allegations were the republicans
if if the situation was that the
allegations were being made by the
democrats then giving attention to the
allegations even if they're false
is a good play
because you're just giving attention to
the thing you want to give attention to
they made a big mistake
by giving attention to a republican
claim
so you can't talk about it being false
without talking about it
they claim the election is rigged they
claim the election is rigged they claim
the election is rigged
i think i think they
convinced their own base that the
election was rigged
yeah it's directly from my book
right i mean what i'm saying now is from
my book on the same topic it's not like
i made it up now to you know fit the
facts to it or something
i've been saying this for a long time
it's a well
concept right nothing new here
all right
um i love cnn's the way they they
gaslight with words
so they've been saying
that
republicans claim 2020 was rigged and
then they used this phrase
despite the lack of evidence
do you think that's a true statement
that
that their claim is the election
that people are saying the election in
2020 was rigged
quote despite the lack of evidence
well it turns that turns out that the
word evidence can be used in two ways
i had to check just to be sure
one way
is that evidence is used sort of
interchangeably with proof
that's one definition
and in that case the evidence is not
really evidence like it's not actual
evidence unless it actually supports the
truth
so by that definition it wouldn't be
evidence if it was just misleading
so misleading evidence wouldn't be
evidence it would just be something
misleading
by that definition so they can use
evidence and proof sort of
interchangeably
and the english language allows them to
do that
do you know what else the english
language allows you to do
it allows you to treat the word evidence
as not being proof
so the word could go either way
evidence can mean proof
or lack of proof when they say no
evidence or it could mean the opposite
and they
since the public can't tell the
difference they can get away with that
but they've they've stretched that
somewhere
um
they've stretched it to
despite the lack of evidence so that
part they get away with because of the
gray area of the word evidence but then
they go all the way to this
despite that
trump continues to push the quote
falsehood that the election was stolen
he's pushing the falsehood
falsehood
how do you know something's false
because you proved it
that's not a thing
all you know is you don't have proof
that it's true
there's no proof there's no it's not a
falsehood so when cnn labels this a
falsehood that's just a lie
it's just the lie it's a lie that could
be true because nobody knows because we
don't have an auditable fully auditable
system but
yeah
it's like they they do these little word
tricks just to move you from a gray area
word evidence
that could be taken either way
all the way to falsehood
that can't be taken either way
so you see the the verbal trickery where
they can get you from a maybe word to a
definite word and
make you not notice the difference it's
very clever
all right
here's a question that also might get to
why the democrats are
maybe having little differences of
agreement about january 6.
and let me let me put this out there
uh
democrats don't like republicans
are you with me so far generally
speaking
democrats are not
lovers of republicans in sort of a
general way lots of exceptions
and
wouldn't you say
that democrats are always looking for
the worst spin to put on whatever
republicans are doing and vice versa
republicans are looking at the worst
spin to put the democrats in that's
sorry that's our general situation right
but let me ask you this
do you think there are any democrats
who are under the impression
that any republicans are not patriots
you think
even even if their democrats don't like
republicans do you think that they
believe that they're not patriots
i don't think so
i think that they think that republicans
are dumb they think republicans are
anti-science they think republicans are
you know immoral for various reasons
whatever that's all true
but do you think that anybody like even
one even one
do you think there's even one democrat
anywhere who believes that republicans
are not patriots meaning that they're
country first
i don't think so
right
i think they now you you see rhetoric
that says that they don't but i think
that's just twitter rhetoric right
that's just trolls the average democrat
does believe that the average republican
cares about the constitution
even more than self sometimes
so how does the average democrat explain
all of these patriots
marching on january 6. it's a little
hard to explain to yourself isn't it
because no matter what they think about
these people
you have to go
pretty far into crazy land
to imagine that they're not patriots at
least in turn in terms of their internal
thinking
they could be wrong they could be
patriots have bad information
they could be patriots
within within the group some of them
criminal
that's all possible
but i don't think there's any democrat
who really believes like in a private
moment
do you think there's any democrat like a
serious person not not a troll but a
serious person who thinks that the
[Music]
the republicans are not patriots at the
base
yeah somebody said bill maher believes
that i don't know you think he does
about not
i don't know what he said but i'll bet
if you talk to him privately you said
all right bill do you seriously think
that republicans in general
are not really patriot oriented like
protect the congress you know protect
not congress protect the constitution
i don't think they think that so i think
there's something that's bugging
democrats
that's unspoken
and i think that something is they know
they're being gaslighted but they don't
know exactly what's going on
i feel like democrats
have to have some suspicion
that the most basic thing about
republicans that they're patriots first
seems to be
opposite of what the january 6
hearings are trying to present
and i don't know how
they can't notice that
you could notice a lot of things
but you couldn't notice that
now i didn't i didn't ask my uh quote
democrat friend who i often mentioned i
did not i did not ask him that question
because it didn't occur to me until
recently because i you know one of the
things i wanted to do was
excuse me
um
i wanted to make a list of things you
would have to believe
in order to agree with your own team and
it could work for both democrats and
republicans
so one of the things you would have to
believe to believe the january 6
situation is you would have to believe
that our
elections are both transparent
fully auditable
and that we can do it somewhat instantly
am i right you would have to believe
that otherwise asking for more
information about the audit would make
perfect sense
it wouldn't look like any kind of a
crime
unless you thought it had already been
done or could easily be done and or you
know that sort of thing
but here's another thing in order for
you to believe the january 6th narrative
as a democrat you would have to believe
that republicans are only fake patriots
that they're only pretending to be
patriots but what they really want is
their dictator in power
that you'd have to believe that in order
to believe any of the narrative
because what i believe
is that there's not a republican life
who would have let trump stay in office
if he had lost
that's what i believe
now that's an exaggeration there would
always be some lawyer or something who
says yeah stay there
there would always be somebody but let's
let me back that up to less of an
absolute because it just makes people
crazy when i talk in absolutes and
probably should i try to avoid it
yeah i i
yeah i just think democrats probably are
noticing that there's something fishy
about the january 6th thing
probably all right
so unless something changes your future
looks like this
trump wins the election and the
democrats
throw away everything they believed
or they say they believe right now and
they say these elections we'd better fix
these because they don't look reliable
now now of course what they're going to
say is that the vote was suppressed
and
i'm sure that'll be the
thing they're finally waking up
maybe a little bit
all right
um
am i wrong that all the news looks good
so the stock market was up yesterday i
think the futures were down so it's
probably down today
so mark it down
let's take a look
the market is
yeah it's almost flat
some up some down
kind of flat
uh something happened with
tesla cartoonist says biden getting
coveted is good news that's more like a
nothing news
scott are you buying crypto no no
no i'm not a crypto investor
uh i'm a crypto diversifier
slight difference right you could argue
that's not different but i would never
invest in a crypto
i would only hold some of the big ones
just in case you know a little bit in
your portfolio just in case you never
know in case civilization falls apart
you just gotta have a bitcoin for
something
your dad grew up with biden and never
heard of the oil on the windshield
biden's hair sniffing finally caught up
with him he got covered
he caught covered from a little girl's
hair
tessa evaluation way off the mark i
don't know what that means
if you have to look at your stock every
day then you shouldn't have it
that's a good rule
my rule is i look at my stocks every day
the market is up
and every day the market is down i don't
look at them
because looking at it is only made to
make you feel good or bad it doesn't
have an investment purpose right that
which be this is the point the point is
you should buy them and hold them
so when i look at them it's just purely
for psychological gain
so when they're up i look at them when
they're down i don't look at them that's
my advice
yeah look at it from the entertainment
value exactly that's perfectly good
uh oh bill gates shorting tesla
so bill gates shorted tesla
what
so what
i don't know does that tell me anything
aren't there a lot of people shorting
tesla
i think that's a
that's not like an obscure position
oh they have some billiard battle yeah
the us open confirms novak can't play
unless he's vaccinated
seriously
wow
really
i thought we were past that but it looks
like it looks like cove is coming back
right
um
you wonder if biden is going to be taken
out because of the coven
now let me ask you this if if biden gets
long coveted
uh
but won't tell me what it is
yeah
if if biden gets long covenant he's not
going to be capable
at what point does kamal harris have to
take over
now if you have not had if you've not
had coveted or if you and i had a bad
case like i did
um you don't know how bad this is
can i get an amen from anybody who had
covet and says i wouldn't want to be
president with this in my head
right how many how many of you think you
could have made presidential decisions
under covet
i i couldn't
my decision was absolutely degraded
absolutely degraded
and let me ask you this
are you comfortable that he hasn't
already been removed
i don't know what his symptoms are
but he's so fragile
that covert long
covet alone should activate the vice
president am i right
covid alone should activate the vice
president and and let me double down on
that
all right i'm going to go where you
don't want me to go
if this were trump
same thing
right if trump gets coveted in office
um
he had it right but if come if trump
gets it again
at whatever his you know future age is
right he did but he was a little bit
younger but if trump gets at his new age
in office you know let's say
election plus two years
what would trump be in
in four years let's say
four years trump would be
82
82.
do the math for me how old would trump
be in four years
how come you haven't told me that how
old is trump you'd be 80 in four years
you're a baby do you think that an 80
year old president
should stay in office when they have
covert
i don't
i mean i'm 65 and there's no way i could
have made good decisions while i had
coveted no way
you take it you take me at 80 and give
me you give me the same code that i had
uh at 65
at age 80
you do not want me making any decisions
trust me
and i feel like i'm pretty mentally
sound and you would not want me making
decisions under those conditions so i
think we need to trigger the vice
president right away
if it's true that he has coveted now i
get it that the doctor's gonna look at
it and if there's no symptoms there's no
symptoms maybe
maybe
but if there are symptoms
that brain fog stuff is really bad stuff
you don't want that
so i think we need to trigger the vice
president right away
just just for the risk of it
because the thing is i don't know if
biden would tell you he had brain fog
would he
do you have brain fog
oh no i don't have any brain fog
what do you know yeah what do you know i
don't know
i'm not see that's the other thing i'm
not sure that people know
how much their brain is degraded here's
a study i'd love to see
since we know the brain fog is a thing i
mean that's
pretty well established i think
could you do a test of iq
of people who are in covet experiencing
it like not even long covered just in it
and a test of iq for somebody not
infected ever
and you do enough of the tests to you
know get an average i'll bet there'd be
a difference
i'll bet you would find that the iq of a
person with with covent
is lower
about you would
temporarily because it takes your energy
away and have you ever tried to take a
test when you're tired
it's a big difference
right
so there's no way
that you that people with covet are
operating at the same mental capacity as
people without it people have never had
it no way
i mean i'd be lucky if i get back to
where i was
and by the way
i don't know if i have
well i was telling you earlier that i
was rereading my writing from 2004
and
if you if you asked me before yesterday
scott did the covid and the long covid
that gave you the brain fog do you think
there's a permanent
you know thing that happened with that i
would say no
no i feel fine in fact if you ask me i
feel like at the top of my mental acuity
right now no no problem at all
and then i read my own writing for 2004.
modified my opinion a little bit
[Laughter]
i don't know if you know where i'm going
on this but in 200 in 2004
i could write a sentence let me
tell you
i could write a good sentence
i'm not so sure they would be just as
good today even though i feel like i'm
at 100
but when i read my my younger writing i
looked at it and said
i don't know if i could do that
i don't know maybe i can do better i
don't know for sure
but
i got a real
it was a wake-up call
when i saw how tight my writing was from
15 years ago
if i write a book today which i'm doing
which hopefully will be a gigantic
bestseller
but
i got my questions
yeah i got my questions whether i'm just
as sharp here's what i think is
happening i think i'm less sharp
but i have more skills in my stack
i think i come out ahead
but i think you would notice the
difference that's what i think
i definitely have more skills in my
overall skill stack
so that might come through in my writing
and give me an advantage but definitely
the quickness
is diminished yeah definitely
all right
and dems that passed a new protocol to
make it easier to remove a president
tesla investors what bet on recovery and
fantasy
yeah
tesla tesla definitely has some fantasy
elements but let me give you the counter
argument for tesla
i heard this from adam townsend
who's a great follow on twitter by the
way adam townsend you should follow him
and this is why i actually bought stock
in tesla which is unusual for me i
wouldn't normally buy an individual
company i normally diversify
but
it's because tesla is a power company
it's not a car company
if you bought it as a car company you
look at all the other
electric cars and you say lots of
competition there
and that doesn't look good but if you
see it as an energy company
because the world is going to need a
whole bunch of batteries
it's a whole different deal
if you see it as an energy company
you have a whole different feeling about
it and that completely reframed my
opinion of it
the the cars might be irrelevant in the
long run
i mean
you remember
was it ebay
ebay started out selling pez dispensers
i think the tesla automobile might be
the pez dispenser for tesla
it's it's just a total fake out of where
the company is going
i think cars are the temporary product
that the big the big product is energy
and
maybe ai
ai and energy probably logistics that
sort of thing
probably yeah amazon started out with
books right exactly perfect example
i think tesla is just starting with cars
i don't think it's a car company
in the long run
um
the pez dispenser was a made-up pr story
yeah okay
you got me
the the pez dispenser story about ebay
is a sort of up origin story
but
it was close enough to my point
but
you're right
i take that fact check i accept your
fact check
but it doesn't change the basic point
um
you don't care for the looks of the new
truck well a lot of people ordered it
all right all right that's all for now
is there anything i missed
is there any topic that you wish
you had my opinion on
i don't know why
um delta airlines started as a crop
dusting service
all right
um i believe the golden age is with us
uh no i'm not a gamer
somebody asked if i'm a gamer
and i'm not and it's only because it's
too addictive i'll tell you my gamer
story just so you've heard it once in
case you haven't
at the dawn of video gaming when i think
sony
sony had the the best console for a
while
uh i may have the name right i think it
was sony and i was a young man
computers were just taken off and i said
i've got to have one of those video
games where i can shoot
shoot aliens out of space and so i
bought this thing it was really hard to
get i forget which one it was
and
maybe a sega i don't know i can't
remember but i got this system and i
brought it home
uh i forget which one it was
and i played it for about eight hours
straight
and when i was done
i felt terrible
terrible
like i lost eight hours of my life
and all i could think of was getting
back to do it again
and nothing had been better
i wasn't smarter stronger
more successful i had just lost eight
hours
that's it
and i felt all nervous
not only did i lose eight hours it
wasn't fun
it was like anxious making because i had
to shoot more aliens
gotta shoot more aliens aliens aliens
and so
after
after uh
you know months of trying to get this
thing because it was hard to get for
some reason there was some kind of
shortage i finally got one i packed that
thing up
took it back to the store for a full
refund
and said i never want to be close to one
of these again
and i haven't
so i i've avoided gaming in all its
forms because it was too dangerous and
remember by the by that time i was you
know i was already a trained hypnotist
as a trained hypnotist
you you sample that you run away
and this would be this would be an
interesting
experiment
i i'll give you a hypothesis my
hypothesis is that trained hypnotists
don't play video games
test that
okay go do a test on that
just a claim
trained hypnotist and i'll go further
somebody who has a phd in psychology
they don't play video games
i'll bet you
i'll bet you people with a phd in
psychology do not play video games
i'll bet you medical doctors even let's
say young ones even going through
medical school and stuff
probably do some of them but i'll bet
not nearly as much as the average person
not nearly as much
right
and
there's a reason
if you have any exposure to that world
you know the world of psychology and
mental health if you have any exposure
to it at all
as soon as you spend a little time
playing video games you know this is
this shit's dangerous and you just run
away
it's good for surgery skills somebody
says maybe some
yeah
so that was my take it was too addictive
now um
how do i explain not running away from
twitter
does anybody know my rationalization for
that
how do i rationalize spending so much
time on twitter
because i know it's addictive
yeah i rationalize it as a business tool
right
but
at the same time i'm rationalizing i'm
so aware that it's a rationalization
so aware now it's also true
like it's true
it is a business tool it is sort of
essential for what i'm doing here it
would be tough to do without it
but
also it's because i love it
right
i don't i don't have a time scheduled
for the russell brand conversation i see
some people asking over here
um i believe he's filming
which by the way
i wish someday i could say that
russell brand's producer said they'll
get back to me with scheduling because
uh russell is off
filming
i want to use that as my excuse someday
oh
oh i'd love to do that but ah
i'll be filming that week
doesn't that sound better than anything
you're doing
because you're working
no he's not off working he's off filming
he's filming
way better than working
how much time do you spend each day on
twitter pretty much all of the in
between time
so i try not to like sit down and do
twitter
but you're always waiting for something
aren't you
you know like you're walking back and
forth or you're
you know you're in between stuff so it's
my in-between thing but in between is
most of my day right
i probably spend more time between
things
than i do on any one thing so
if you if you were to mass all the
actual minutes
good question i'll give you an estimate
as best i can subjectively
if i if i imagine my day and how many
times i check
one hour
one hour
best guess one hour per day
it might be off that feels like about
right
but because it's in 30 second increments
so there's probably 120 half minute
you know increments during the day
yeah it is it is a time suck and it is
an addiction but like i said i got a
rationalization
max
says are you dating
max i don't think you're my type but
thanks for asking
check your iphone for time spent on
twitter oh yeah
let's let's do that
it's in the
settings
screen time
that's just screen time right i don't
know
uh app
um i don't want to do tech support while
you're live streaming here but i thought
it'd be easier to find it
um
i thought it'd be under screen time
that's where i'd put it
where would you put it on your phone
see all activity
all activity
where's that
all right well thank you apple for
making it once again impossible to find
anything
yeah i can't find it
yeah as usual there are three ways to
get to it
there's always five ways to do i think
on your phone and
four of them don't work
do i like
ethnic or spicy food
i thought everybody did
of course i do
um
a friend
[Laughter]
over on youtube
somebody's mad at backs for for getting
noticed in the comments
and wasting his question on it
all right battery use
um oh it's a battery use thing if i look
at my battery use that will tell me what
i'm using now there we go
battery use and where would i see that
all right well i'll figure that out
later
um
i'm just looking at your i know it's in
the settings
uh scott would you date a trans to avoid
persecution
i'm not sure i understand the question
would i date a trans to avoid
persecution
i don't know if that's a
thing
uh
count your antennas what
your comments are all weird now
uh screen time and see all activity i
don't have that option
if i hit
this is like looking for anything on
social media
if you try to google how to do anything
you'll always get an answer
and it would be wrong
have you had that experience if you have
any technical question
except for how to how to reboot your uh
os that's about the only one you get the
right answer but anything that's like a
technical question you'll definitely get
an answer
and it will be wrong
every time
ninety percent of the time
i'd say ninety percent of the technical
solutions on google are absolutely wrong
all right
all right uh that's all for now and i
will talk to you
oh the name of the prequel to god's
debris is called the religion war
uh i heard earlier that it's so hard to
get it got bit up to 60
on on amazon because it's it's out of
print it'd be hard to find
but i got to tell you it blew me away
when i read it i'm not even sure i could
read it without
too much of an emotional reaction
that was my plan
all right that's all for now i'll talk
to you tomorrow
