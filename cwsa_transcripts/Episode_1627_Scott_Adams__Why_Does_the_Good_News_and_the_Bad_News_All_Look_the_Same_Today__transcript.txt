good morning everybody and welcome to
the best damn thing that ever happened
to you called
coffee with scott adams famous across
the world
i know
you're probably spreading the word
hit that subscribe button
now
and while you're doing that why don't
you prepare a copper mug of glass a
tanker chelsea steiner canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite beverage
beverage i said
and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's
called the simultaneous sip and damn
it's going to be good
here it comes here it comes go
yep
i like coffee
that's right
well let's talk about the fake news
first
there's a uh a rupard clip of democrat
paul bagala
being taken out of context i think i saw
it tweeted by mediaite
and here's how you can tell that
somebody's being taken into context
if the clip ends as soon as they said
the bad thing
that is such a tell
so if somebody says
i'm going to see if i can make one up
if i'm on tv and i say something like
well you know
death is good for orphans
clip
and then suddenly the
you know the clip has ended
you could be sure that whatever i said
after i said death is good for orphans
probably would clarify
maybe put it in context
and suddenly you'd say oh that was a
joke or
an analogy or something else so here's
what happened uh paul begala said that
uh
i think the problem for the democrats
right now is not that they have bad
leadership they have bad followers okay
clip
clip is done
now do you think he said anything after
the democrats have bad followers
do you think he said anything after that
that clarified his thought
of course
of course they did
and it was obviously fake news if you
saw where it was clipped because they
clipped it right away it's like
and what did he say after that softened
it
what he said is that leadership responds
to the public
and if the public could you know get its
opinions together the leadership would
follow
exactly what i tell you all the time
i tell you that the the people run the
government and always have in the united
states
different in other places
but in the united states if 75 of us say
hey government we need this
it'll happen
it's just hard to get to 75
but it's the public who's in charge
the public's in charge period
all right so i agree with uh paul bagala
on that minor point there
um
today i'm introducing a
new category
things that people did say but maybe
they shouldn't have
things that might be technically true
but maybe you shouldn't say it out loud
maybe you shouldn't here's an example
joe biden said on martin luther king day
that george floyd's death probably had a
bigger impact
now
is that technically true
it might be because the impact of social
media and and you know all the all the
stuff that happened it might have had
actually a bigger worldwide impact just
because the world is a different place
it could be that on the day that martin
luther king was killed of course that
the story was you know international
news
but
it probably didn't have that much of an
impact right away if you know what i
mean
so
i think joe biden could make a case
as obnoxious as it sounds
that the george floyd thing was a really
big impact and maybe even bigger than
mlk
at the moment of the assassination
now you could disagree with that
but here's what you probably don't
disagree with
why would you say that out loud on
martin luther king day
i mean
i'm all for people having you know
different opinions and i think you know
if he tried he might be able to back up
that opinion but i don't think that's
the point
i think the point is
how could you be so
let's say confused about what the room
needs at that moment to think that that
was the way to play that
i don't know i feel like maybe just keep
that one to yourself even if you think
it
well the continuing roganization of
america is happening
this has got to be a sign of that we
live in a simulation
it seems to me
that at all times there has to be an
adult white male
that 40 percent of the population is
 on
and if you don't have one you've got to
go get a new one
so it used to be
trump and then trump you know faded into
the background a little bit
and and we needed an adult white male to
 on for 40 of the public and there's
joe rogan just accidentally becoming the
biggest not accidentally but becoming
the biggest thing in podcasting and
maybe the most influential person in the
country at this point
and there he is oh we got an adult white
male to on
am i wrong that we always needed an
adult white male to on
and that the reason is
is it's the one category you can on
with no
no holds barred you don't have to you
don't even have to
regulate your speech
you don't have to be careful how you
insult them
so that you're saying the criticism
cleanly
without you know straying into racism or
bigotry
you have to have an adult white male
who's the target of all of our
i know
frustrations ire
uh
false beliefs scapegoating and all that
stuff
so it seems to be but how how uh
pervasive this is the way it turns out
is that you can't have a story unless
you compare it to something about the
joe rogan situation
like oh it's raining today it's raining
do you know
who joe rogan had on his podcast that
time
talking about climate change like
everything is now a joe rogan
related story even if it's not the way
trump was
remember when trump was in the news
there could be a story about a bear it's
a camper
and it would be like well would the bear
have eaten the camper
if trump were not president and then
suddenly everything's about trump but
here's the most crazy example this so
yesterday i
was at a local auto repair shop
getting some repairs
some bodywork on my car
and it's just in my neighborhood so i
literally just dropped the car off and
walk home it's close enough to just walk
home
and
so i'm chatting with the owner it's just
a little local
local thing
and he mentioned something about you
know the last time he talked to joe
rockin
and i thought i heard him wrong i was
like like maybe he was talking about the
last time you watched the show or
something
i said
do you know joe rogan
and remember i'm like just down the road
at the body shop
and he says oh yeah i've been doing i
did all of his cars for years
now joe rogan doesn't even live in this
part of the state
or he's in austin i guess now but when
he was in california he was in southern
california and i'm in northern
california
but apparently
on a fairly regular basis
the guy down the street had
conversations with joe rogan about
mostly cars i guess
because he must be a car guy
and
how in the world
is every place i go turned into a joe
rogan experience
is this a coincidence
it's such a weird thing
and then then of course i'm sitting
there and i go well you know i was on
his show
and and he's like what
you know him too
it's like somehow
somehow
joe rogan went from you know a popular
podcast to
something about the culture it's just
woven into the culture now in just the
weirdest way
i mean i don't even know what the
importance of that is other than it was
weird
um
question for you now that we have data
and of the utter pradesh
area in
india
which shows fairly conclusively that
taking ivermectin
is associated with
reducing automobile deaths to zero
i'm wondering if there's an argument yet
for mandating that all automobile
drivers all licensed drivers take
ivermectin
because the data seems pretty strong
that at the same time people were taking
ivermectin
actually all accidental deaths went to
zero during that period so nobody
drowned so maybe you could maybe it
could be mandated
that if you're a swimmer
you could take ivermectin because during
that period uh there were no accidental
drownings
of people taking ivermectin
uh so no car crashes no accident nobody
died of old age
actually nobody died of any cause
so we have some good data on that
and i'm generally not in favor of
mandates but you know if you can if you
can save millions of people
well i mean i'll take it into
consideration
and it looks like the data is pretty
strong the ivermectin stops automobile
accidents
now some of you are thinking scott that
data is not strong
it's as strong as the data that says
ivermectin crushed covid in the same
region
because it's the same data
so the data that says that nobody died
of covid while taking ivermectin
also says nobody died in any other way
while ivermectin was being used so i
don't think that's a coincidence
is it i think i think all of the
i think it went to zero because they
took ivermectin so now that we have good
data on that oh
i'm not really worried about automobile
accidents even if i were to drive drunk
i don't drink
but i'm thinking about starting because
i have a good feeling that if you took
automobile accidents to zero
in this one area where they were using
ivermectin that would suggest that even
the drunk drivers were not getting in
accidents
and even the people
who might have been hit by a drunk
driver
who presumably would not be on
ivermectin or or if they were they would
survive
but you could be not on ivermectin
be hit by a drunk driver who was on
ivermectin
and it would still protect you
that's what the data says because there
were no deaths from automobile accidents
or drunk driving or anything
during that period
so i think i'm a convert now i was sort
of a little skeptical on ivermectin
before and i know it hasn't gone through
all of the rigorous trials but when i
see strong data like this that it can
eliminate all causes of death
i think that's worth the risk management
that's the that's a risk benefit i would
take
to remove the risk of all forms of death
on another topic the supply chain
looks like is worse than ever
i was under the impression that the
biden administration had cleverly put
financial incentives in the forms of
fines in place
and that that would be enough
but apparently it's the worst it's ever
been
this is terrible leadership right
i don't feel like this supply chain
problem at this point
is anything but failed leadership
now in the beginning of any crisis
you could say well that's not really
wasn't leadership unless they saw it
coming
it's you know something happened and
then we had to respond to it but now
it's been months
are you telling me that we're so
incompetent in this country we can't
unload a boat
really
really
the the united states
is the superpower of superpowers and we
can't figure out how to unload some
boats
that's too hard
well scott you don't understand
there's space constraint and there are
really a lot a lot of ships
yeah no i'm not impressed by your space
constraints or your lot of ships
that's got to be failed leadership it's
just got to be
now i'd be saying the same thing as
trump or president
now you might not believe that but but i
would
you know on day one it doesn't look like
a leadership failure but
now
are you kidding me
how is this not a leadership failure
you know i don't know if you've had this
experience but
lately my life is like living in canada
or maybe the uk
and what i mean by that is that i can't
buy any of the products in the store i
used to buy
i can't get a car
i mean i can buy it and do the paperwork
but ford won't send it to me because it
doesn't exist
and even heard from a ford executive i
should just cancel the order because
they're lying to me basically
yeah i'm paraphrasing
so when i go to the store
i've got this like off-brand shampoo
and i'm eating off-brand you know snacks
and off-brand everything so it's like
being in canada i can speak to the
locals and they understand me but when i
buy a product i don't i don't recognize
the packaging anymore
i swear to god it's just like being in
canada
i mean unless you're canadian then it's
different
yes i do use shampoo weird i know
there's a story to that but
you don't care
uh it's more for the body than for the
head that's that's the short version
um
and it's it's because of uh skin issues
not because of hair
long story anyway
um i would like to award the not a
hypocrite
the not a hypocrite award so this is
something i just made up every now and
then a leader will say something honest
and it will cause all kinds of trouble
and here's a leader i'll call him a
leader i think that's fair
who said something that was just so
honest
that the whole internet just blew up
and i've never seen this kind of honesty
before now i don't like it that's why
the internet broke up so i don't like
what he's saying
what he's saying to me sounds horrible
but bam i am so impressed by the
transparency
that i don't know what to say about this
i just kept listening over over and over
so the topic is a billionaire a venture
capitalist who is a part owner of the
warriors basketball team uh chairmath
pala pitaya i hope i got that quite
close
pelaha patia palepitia
i think that's close
anyway he was being asked about owning
the warriors i guess and doing business
in china and the uyghur situation
and here's what he said
chalmette said
nobody cares about what's happening to
the uyghurs okay
of all the things that i care about is
below my line and then he emphasized it
several times
below the line
don't care about it nobody cares about
it
now
number one
it's shockingly awful to to hear it
right my
my morality and sense of right and wrong
are seriously challenged by this
seriously challenged
but
i'm going to give him a pass
i'm going to give him a pass
because i prefer the transparency over
the lie
i do
and this is the most transparent thing i
think i've ever seen from anybody in a
leadership position i mean you could
argue whether owning the warriors and
being a non-managing owner he's so he's
not a manager
uh being a non-managing owner i don't
know maybe that's not leadership but
this sort of is
and
i i'm just my jaw just dropped and i
thought
he's telling us actually the truth
he's telling us exactly how he feels
with no ambiguity whatsoever
and he's not wrong
because the reason it's the not a
hypocrite award and it's so rare is that
his actions and his words are completely
compatible
he's not taking any action about
anything related to the uyghurs in china
and then his words back it up completely
no ambiguity at all i don't care
nobody cares when he says nobody cares
that's hyperbole but he's basically
saying he doesn't care
i i lit i listened to him say those
words this is not an exaggeration
maybe 30 or 40 times
because i couldn't stop listening to it
i wanted to comment and i didn't know
how
it's so confusing to have somebody say
something that's so completely offensive
you know just my brain goes ah when i
hear it at the same time is completely
true
and completely consistent with his
actions
and completely legal
he lives in a world where that's
completely legal
i know part of me says that's how he
became a billionaire
did anybody else have that feeling
that you could be offended by it but at
the same time you're thinking to
yourself well maybe that's why he's a
billionaire and you're not
right
because he could do that
could you do that
i couldn't do that i mean i could say a
lot of provocative things in public but
i couldn't have done that i mean maybe
if i had a few billion dollars i could
but yeah probably i could if i had a few
billion dollars i guess i could
but uh
i don't know i was weirdly impressed and
uh
alarmed at the same time now the
warriors organization
uh put out an announcement and said
he doesn't speak for us he's just he's
just a financial owner he's not a he
doesn't have any leadership uh role
within the team itself apparently
so the warriors are distancing
themselves from their own order which
makes sense
so there's a story that matt gates
congressman matt gakes his ex-girlfriend
reportedly is given some kind of
immunity to testify
is that bad news or good news
is it bad news or good news that his
ex-girlfriend now remember he's been
charged or alleged
to have some involvement with um
maybe a relationship with her when she
was under 18 when she was 17.
allegedly we don't know about that and
then maybe
he's being accused of trafficking
what exactly is the trafficking charge
is that is that because they traveled
across state lines
some weird little law like that
so in the comments somebody said we
don't care
exactly
that's where i was going with this
how many of you would care let's say you
found that it was true this is just
speculative because we don't know what's
true and what's not but just a for
instance
suppose you found out that congressman
gates did have a sexual relationship
with somebody who hadn't yet turned 18
but when she did
she was perfectly happy with the
situation
and continued dating him for a while
how do you feel about that
crime
put them in jail lock them up
worst thing that ever happened in the
history of the united states
now suppose you also knew
that in the context of their
relationship which continued after 18th
birthday allegedly we don't know
but suppose you had found out that they
had traveled across state lines
i don't even know if that's really the
problem
would you care about that
they were in an actual relationship
allegedly
who would
who would care about that
an arbitrary state line why is that
important
now i suppose there might be more to it
like
money changed hands
what if you found out
the money did change hands
but that it was just part of
a relationship
i mean i'm in a relationship in which
money changes hands am i more moral
because i'm married
is that how it works
it's immoral if you're not married
i mean how do we care about any of this
if we're not caring about the uyghurs
how in the hell are we caring about this
is it
let me ask again because i i may have
missed an answer is there even one
person
who thinks that should be a punishable
crime might be a technical crime but oh
there is one
her parents oh i got a yes
okay
let's see
yeah you know the
here's here's the dividing line
if she turned 18 and said oh man i sure
wish i hadn't done that i'd feel a lot
different wouldn't i
but if she goes the rest of her life
saying you know it was just a good
experience
yeah
is it our business
i mean i think i needed something closer
to a victim before i get excited about
anything
speaking of the uyghurs i was uh
i saw an argument by scott horton i
think he's a libertarian
in which he says that we shouldn't be
necessarily believing all the uyghur
stories about genocides and what's going
on there what do you think about that
given the poor quality of information
about basically everything
everything
why would you believe
the uyghur situation
and and that question was put to me
essentially and it's a good question
don't you think
do you think you could believe the
exiles
what level of credibility on the square
on a scale of 1 to 10
where 10 is the most credible
how much credibility would you put in
the exile reports which apparently are
conflicting
i'm seeing numbers all over the place
somebody said a 10 that's interesting
well you know that exile reports are
notoriously unreliable right because
they have an agenda
historically they're notoriously
unreliable
so if you are only relying on exile
reports um i'm not even sure i would pay
attention honestly
i probably wouldn't even pay attention
because i wouldn't believe them
exiles
tend to lie about you know i mean we
have a country that's packed with egg
exiles right now
right and how many of them got into the
country because they lied about being
politically discriminated in their
country
exiles might be the most lying group of
people in the world because they have a
reason
right they have a legitimate reason to
lie for self-defense
and maybe fix something in their old
country
didn't we attack iraq because
the dissidents or the exiles told us
there were weapons of mass destruction i
mean i wouldn't i wouldn't trust
anything an exile says
but
they're not the only ones right
now there's other evidence and the other
evidence
you know you could argue is sketchy as
well
here's my
bottom line
it doesn't matter what evidence you have
there there are
claims which rise to the level of
credible enough
they should look into it
and the gut and china is not letting the
world look into it that's all you need
you're done
remember the government any government
chinese government american government
is guilty until proven innocent it's not
the other way around
innocent until proven guilty is only in
an american and other westernized
type
systems
but that's for citizens only citizens
are presumed innocent
governments are presumed guilty
they've damn well got to show you that
they're not stealing the money because
otherwise they just could
and you know so yeah the fact that china
is not transparent
the fact that you can't just go visit
the the uyghur camp and talk to them
that's all you need
that's all you need it doesn't even
matter if it's true
they have
essentially confessed
basically confessed
i would say the same thing is true of
american elections
do i have evidence that american
elections are fraudulent i do not
i do not have that evidence
but i assert that you have to treat them
as though they are
because the the elections can't be fully
audited you can't get to the electronic
parts at all
so well not at all but you can't get to
them reliably
so when you can't have transparency in a
government you have to assume there is
guilt and act that way
doesn't mean it's real
but that's the way you should act if
you're being rational
because governments the high things have
a reason to hide it they don't hide
things for no reason
and if they had it and if they had an
other reason to hide it well we'd
probably know what that was right it's
not like it's a
military secret or something
so um
apparently there's a movement within the
mega movement a small movement
in which a number of people believe that
jfk jr is alive really he didn't really
die in that car crash in 1999. he's
going to come back as trump's vp
and apparently the way that they got to
this was um
with the leader of this
combined q anon
with numerology
because q anon by itself it lacked the
credibility that it needed
and numerology by itself
is often called a
pseudoscience
but if you put them together
huh
if you put them together magic and
that's what
apparently some believers
have decided is true and not only is jfk
jr
still live and coming back despite being
a democrat joining joining no doubt
donald trump and his his group but also
some other famous dead people such as
michael jackson
who apparently faked his death and once
the
trump and jfk jr team up they will go
after the secret
cabal of pedophiles that are running the
world globally
so
that's that
now
um
seems feasible seems plausible
yeah finally
finally that's what somebody says
finally it's about time we
put together the
dead celebrities with trump to take care
of this
global satanic pedophile cabal
of course the real story here is that
the mainstream news will give as much
attention as possible to the crazy
people
to paint all republicans as crazy
likewise
there are not nearly as many
progressives and crazy liberals on the
left
as
as we like to be told
you know so the right is telling you
that there are tons of progressives when
there really are not that many
there aren't that many aocs
but i don't know how many it takes
there was an enormous tonga volcano
eruption
a once in a millennium event that caused
some tsunamis on the california coast
small ones
it closed i think it closed an airport
on catalina island because the airport
they thought they would get swamped
um
and
that's the whole story
um
china is saying that uh a recent
infection in beijing which caused them
to close down a whole office building
and lock it down
they believe the source is a canadian
male
they think the virus came in in the mail
from canada
so
i don't know if that's a thing
do you think you can mail coven from
canada
do you think if you had covert and you
licked an envelope
and then it
went all the way to
to china
do you think that
you think that covenant would still be
alive
that's what china thinks
but as i tweeted i don't have covid
personally
but if accidentally i were to get
coveted
and it happened to be the anniversary of
my stepson's death from
uh fentanyl
that comes from china
you're going to need to put me in prison
to keep me from looking stationary and
sending it to china is all i'm saying
so you don't want me to have coveted
and stationary and stamps
on the same day
that's the anniversary of my stepson's
overdose death
because i'm pretty sure it would be some
kind of a
crime to lick covert onto an envelope
and send it to china
i'm just saying you wouldn't be able to
stop me from doing it
i'm not saying it's good
i'm not saying it wouldn't kill millions
i'm just saying if i happened to
coincidentally
get the virus and it was kicking my ass
on the same day that was the anniversary
of my stepson's death from their
fentanyl
you would have to lock me up to keep me
from sending my covet to china
or at least trying
at least try
i'm sure it's a crime
um
so
here is the weirdest thing in the world
it is looking more and more like i
had exactly the right choice
for vaccinations
not confirmed
because i could die tomorrow from a clot
and and
satisfy my new nickname claw adams would
you agree
that there's nothing that would stop me
from
dying tomorrow because of the
vaccination
could be
but here's what we know so far all right
now keep in mind that all information is
preliminary
but there is some preliminary
information
that suggests um
the very best situation is to have two
vaccinations the boosters don't seem to
help and
um
and that two boost two vaccinations and
then get omicron
your very best situation is two
vaccinations and then get a omicron and
that gives you the best
antibodies
now that's probably where i'm going to
end up
so
i waited as long as possible to get a
shot
then i got a shot now getting the shot
could kill me right
do you all agree
because some people are you know will
die from almost any medication so
whatever you think the risk is it's just
the fact
that you could die from
a vaccine
now the boosters don't seem to help
against omicron that's today's latest
information again all information is
subject
to possibly being wrong and revised but
that's all we know now
so um we also heard so and again this is
information that would need to be
confirmed but early information seems to
show that being vaccinated
and then getting covered
vastly reduces your long covert risk
have you heard that one yet
now again you know you yes you have to
do more
more studies blah blah blah
but have you heard that yet
that if long covent is what you're
worried about there's now i think the
first of its kind study it's not a
randomized controlled trial so it's
observational and it's got some problems
yeah some people are saying it's
debunked and i'll get to that in a
minute
so i'm not saying that you should
believe it
because the nature of it was i guess
they asked people to
tell their situation you know were you
vaccinated
and then what kind of long covet
symptoms did you have
and what they got was a result they
showed and i know some of you saying
that it's been debunked
but
let me finish the the point i i hear
what you're saying
um
it's the only information we have
on that exact topic
about long covet and vaccinations
i don't think it's you should take it as
confirmation
but it's the only one we have
so if the only information we had said
the opposite
i'd be telling you the same thing which
is well
that's bad news but it's not confirmed
so just just the fact that it looks like
it's good news for people who are in my
specific situation doesn't mean it's
confirmed
but would you agree
it's the only information we have
so it might be faulty
but it's such a strong indication
much like ivermectin
the reason you believe
[Music]
let's see what that is
the reason you believe ivermectin works
is not because of a randomized
controlled trial
if you believe it
um
that's weird
my security camera is not working but
that's why i have a backup
i always have more than one security
camera oh it's just a package
all right no invaders um
so
so my situation based on uh data that
may not be accurate is is
the following
two vaccinations seems better than one
or none
two vaccinations seems all you need
compared to boosters at least in terms
of staying alive
and not getting uh
not getting anything
and
my biggest concern was long covet
my biggest concern was long covered
and the only information we have
suggests that being vaccinated makes a
big difference
now
definitely challenge the data
definitely because all the data needs to
be challenged
but
as of this moment
based on all the studies we have very
incomplete ones
i'm in the best situation
likewise as somebody pointed out it's
been two years now since the first
trials of the vaccination is that about
right give me a fact check on that
about two years
about two years since the first
vaccinations
in trials
which means that we do have long-haul
information for two years
now
if you're going to get a clot that could
be you know years down the line so that
doesn't mean you have
found out everything you need to know
but
with our current bad data subject to
revision
so far my choices are all the right ones
doesn't mean they're the right ones
i don't want you to hear that
if what you heard is scott just said he
made the right choices nope nope
nothing like that
what i said was if the current data is
correct and that's a really big f
it would indicate that made the right
choice now the varus database as of
today i saw anatoly lubarski
was showing the varus database and how
many of the records are obviously wrong
so
i i didn't dig into his argument but
apparently the various database is just
a hot mess
so
in in much the way you shouldn't trust
the studies that i just said you
definitely shouldn't trust the various
database
you shouldn't ignore it
but it's not telling you anything
conclusive
just don't ignore it that's the best you
can do
all right
so
just hear me clearly i'm not saying i
made the right choices because if i die
tomorrow i made the wrong choice
but based on everything we know now
the science all points all of it
to i made the right choice
the unknowns are the different story
right because the science doesn't settle
all the unknowns and the unknown is what
happens with you know the i guess the
malone theory
dr malone theory that in the long run i
could have issues
so that's still that's still live right
that's i mean i can't rule that out
all right
um
i have some advice for you pro tip
never adjust your initial strategy
during the fog of ore
even when the data shows you're firing
in the wrong direction
do you know why
so suppose you're you know the fog of
war refers to
all the sudden gunfire starts and you
don't know where it's coming from and
you don't know what the nature of the
enemy is so you just start oh what do i
do and you start just firing in every
direction or hiding or something so in
the fog of war when you know there's an
attack but you don't know what the hell
the attack is
you're not going to do the right stuff
but one of the things i've learned and i
used to think that once you learned what
the right thing was
that then you should move from guessing
to move to the right thing you know have
a strategy
that's built to design you know designed
to fight the enemy that you've now
determined you have
but i've learned from the internet to
not do that and if your initial strategy
during the fog of war was completely
wrong
you should keep it
and just just keep with the wrong
strategy do you know why
is it is it obvious to everybody or no
why should you keep the strategy that's
proven wrong
seriously
i thought this would be easier
i'm a little
surprised oh i thought you would be able
to dig a little deeper on this without
my help
wow
now let me say it again because maybe i
said it unclearly this should be easy
if your initial strategy isn't working
during the period when you don't know
what's what
and then when you learn you learn what's
what
and you know that your strategy is
definitely the wrong one
you should not change it you should keep
your original strategy
why
i can't believe nobody gets this right
oh get somebody got it okay smooth
noodle map
got the right answer because otherwise
you'd be moving the goal posts
and we know that's bad
so never move the goal posts
now
i would say a year ago if you had asked
me that question i'd say
well yeah you should be continuously
adjusting not only what you know
but what you're doing
so that what you're doing matches where
you want to get
based on what you now know
but
at least a thousand people have told me
that's stupid and that what you really
want to do is stick with what you were
doing before
because otherwise it's just moving the
goalposts you're just moving the
goalposts
so for example when we were told that uh
vaccinations
would prevent spread of the virus
and then all it turns out that it
doesn't prevent spread of the virus
it turns out that the only thing it does
is keep you alive
so should you get vaccinated
hell no
i just explained to you that moving the
goal posts is for fools
keep the same
strategy
and if your strategy was these
vaccinations don't stop this spread
well
then you should get rid of them because
your strategy was to stop the spread
why would you be concerned
about saving people's lives
when that was never even the goal
the goal was to
stop the spread
and then do it that way but if you can't
do it that way
just
well
i think i made my point
um i asked this question i was wondering
if people would get infected with covet
are the same people who tend to get
colds a lot
you ever think about that
if you get colds a lot
would you also get covet
and so i did a survey the the least
scientific survey you could ever do on
twitter but i really didn't get the
answer i thought even though it's
unscientific
um
25 percent this is the biggest number
uh got covered but they rarely get colds
and that's that was the biggest number
so there are more people who rarely get
colds who got covered
then there are people who routinely get
colds
and get coveted in fact
the people who got coveted who also
often get colds
were only four percent
now i realized that a twitter poll is
the lowest level of data you could
possibly imagine
but
this is kind of stark isn't it only four
percent of the people who often get
colds also got
coveted
it must be the way i asked the question
i
i think this is so botched up it doesn't
tell me anything
but um i don't think there's a
correlation now one of the reasons that
people don't get covered it is
speculated is that they have a healthier
lifestyle
so they're just more better immunity
they get more sleep they have less
stress
there might be some genetic component
and there here's the weird one there
might be something about practice
if you're a person who is often infected
and around infected people it can build
your immunity
so people who had lots of regular colds
might actually be more immune from
coronavirus because they've had more
practice
so it doesn't mean that you know getting
lots of colds means you have a bad
immune system it could be that you're
just exposed to a lot of germs like
you're a daycare worker or something so
it could be the people who just get a
lot of colds are just exposed to it
and that makes them relatively strong
when the covet hits and they don't get
it
now
don't believe my twitter poll but that's
what it says
or at least it suggests that that might
be possible i don't know yeah the these
low quality and this is the lowest
quality you could get
uh polls don't do anything unless
there's like a shocking
result and then maybe you check it
better
this is kind of a shocking result to me
i don't know if it's meaningful but it
did shock me
here's the covet update so it's uh two
weeks until february first the day that
the public would like to be done with
mandates
and the latest is that we are plateauing
in the next two weeks
just in time
just in time so it looks like we're
plateauing
uh 20 of americans at least have been
infected at this point with covet
um
and
well here's another thing that i've been
doing right apparently weed
well let me get to that moment
so
the number of people dying is now under
two thousands like 1700 per day in the
united states but here's what they are
not reporting so 1700 people died of
covid i guess yesterday
how many were obese
how many were over 80.
you really need to know that now right
like we always needed to know it
but we're at the point where the number
is low enough
that if that's 80 percent obese
come on
come on i don't think it mattered as
much when the number was sky high
right if it's a 5 000 you're not maybe
you're not asking as much what's the
nature of the the mix of people but when
you get down to 1700
don't you want to know if 1500 of them
were very elderly or obese
you want to know that right because if
that's true
then it's just over
i mean we all think it's over at this
point but the data would support it at
that point quite strongly so let me
again give you my standard for the
government
if the government doesn't tell you
something that you know is important and
they could tell you if they wanted to
you have to assume they're guilty
in this context that means you have to
assume that they're not telling you how
many of the 1700 deaths were very old or
very
overweight
you have to assume there's a reason they
don't tell you that and the reason is
they don't want you to know that you're
not in danger if you're not in one of
those categories
so i would consider this a confession
that the pandemic is over
and
um
the the other good news is that there
seems to be a
marijuana extract
that looks like it can prevent infection
from covet now of course it's just the
test tube and these things don't usually
work in the real people and apparently
smoking doesn't work
because it's they add heat and they
change the nature of the cannabinoid or
whatever the hell it is so you can't get
it just by smoking a lot
so they say
so they say but i would say that is the
attitude for quitters
i think maybe you can't smoke enough pot
to make a difference
that's what i think
i'm not so sure i can't
but i don't think you can
nor should you try
but i'm going to take a run at it
i'm going to take a serious run at it i
think i can completely
cure my covet or maybe not even get it
by some amount of marijuana i don't know
how much it is but i'm gonna find it
and
uh let me ask this question for those of
you who have had covent okay
for anybody who had coven and got the
the pain you know the aches and pains
how many of you made your covet pain go
away
with weed
anybody
how many of you made your
covid
on discomfort go away
see a yes
i see and i did i see a yes i see a yes
yes yes
um
i see a thumbs up
so
i'm not a doctor and you shouldn't take
doctor advice from me
but
if i get anything that makes my body
hurt
i'm gonna smoke until it doesn't and it
works every time basically
all right but don't take don't take any
uh medical advice from me you get
yourself killed
all right well be between the fact that
it's uh anti-inflammatory
and the fact that if you could get
through the tar in my lungs or whatever
the health is in weed
good luck virus
haven't gotten me yet
michael mina who's the the best known
person associated with rapid testings
just got covered
and you knew he was going to get covered
right
because he's the number one voice in
rapid testings and then he used his
rapid test and this was fascinating so
he had symptoms before his before the
rapid test could find it
but 24 hours later it counted easily
so apparently your rapid test won't work
at least necessarily on the first day
you have symptoms
so if you tested on the first day you
had symptoms and you got a negative
do you go to work
what do you do
because because you probably should wait
for the second day and test again
because you know
mina's experience is probably common we
don't know but i'll bet it is i'll bet
you have symptoms before your
the the rapid test can pick it up
all right um
here's what i think
we should do on february 1st
i don't believe we should riot and i
don't believe we you should burn your
mask and i don't if if your state
requires them and i don't believe that
you should get in anybody's face and i
don't believe you should be violent and
i don't believe you should do any of
that here's all you need to do
and you only need 10 percent of the
public i estimate
to do this and it will break the system
the system meaning requiring masks
all you do is put your mask in your
pocket
when you walk into a building that
requires masks
that's it
that's that's the whole protest
and then somebody comes up to you or not
and says oh we require masks
and then you say and this is important
you say oh i'm sorry i thought we were
following the science
and then you say i apologize and
if we're not following the science i'll
be happy to put my mask on
but make sure you engage them in
conversation a little bit do you know
why
because the tenth person that engages
that employee in conversation about a
mask
will be the breaking point
and that when the 11th person comes in
with a mask in their pocket
the employee is just going to say
it
and just going to do their job
because it's not the employee's job to
talk to every person with a mask in
their pocket
and have a conversation with them about
why they should wear it
so
you do not have to be a rebel
you just have to be somebody who had a
mask in your pocket
it's all it takes
anybody disagree
do you think that won't work
yeah because if you get 10 without a
mask
other people take off their masks
i i think herd herd behavior
just needs to be kick-started
so if you're in the brave 10
nobody will even know that you're
protesting
they'll just think you forgot to put
your mask on and take it out of your
pocket
you will be completely invisible
as a protester
you'll just be so oh sorry thanks for
the reminder i i didn't realize we
weren't following the science anymore
put it on
um
we were vaccinated how did morris
supposedly die after this shalika
sunshine asked me this since
since almost all of the vulnerable
population has been immunized
how did moore supposedly die after this
and the answer is that vaccinations
don't prevent deaths
and they don't prevent natural death
from other things
so it's the right question
that is the right question but uh if
that if back to these vaccinations
prevented all deaths
then that would be a real question but
since people do die with it you'd expect
that
the more virus there is it doesn't
matter if you're vaccinated or not
the the only thing that matters is is
there more virus
more virus equals more deaths
whether you're vaccinated or not in our
current situation
but you're right if the vaccines had
worked
you know in terms of preventing
transmission that'd be a different thing
all right
i also have a theory that the attractive
women will lead us out of the pandemic
do you know why
try this experiment
if there's anybody attractive in your
family who's female
could be a spouse
could be a sister
could be an older daughter
walk into a place that requires masks
you wear your mask and have the
attractive female who's with you doesn't
matter who it is
not wear a mask
the attractive female will not be asked
to put on a mask
you might
i might
watch
it it's it's pretty privilege
yeah there is pretty privilege
so the attractive women who never get in
trouble for anything am i right am i
right
attractive women don't really get in
trouble for anything
i mean you'd have to murder and even
then you'd probably get away with it
so since pretty women can get away with
really anything
uh if they're the first ones to go
maskless
um
they can lead us out
do you know who can't lead us out
adult white males
adult white males
wrong leadership
do you know who else could lead us out
black people
black people
because just like pretty privilege
at least you know in my town
people are a little less
careful or known a little less
what would say
spring-loaded
to tell a black person to put a mask on
now
don't blame me for racism i'm blaming
other people for being racists
so i'm saying other people are racist
and because they're racist they're not
treating everybody the same
i was in a a grocery store yesterday
where 100 of the people had masks on
with one exception
a black man who was six foot seven
he had a mask but it was on his chin
do you think anybody went up to the six
foot seven black guy in my mostly white
town
and asked him to put a mask on
nope
nope
because i was shopping for a long time
and i ran into him a number of times
nobody asked him to put his mask on
how about if i go
if i go there with an attractive woman
who forgot her mask does anybody ask her
to put it on
i don't know
that hasn't happened but i don't think
it will
so
attractive women
and
black americans
please lead us
some leadership is required right now
and i don't think i can do it at least
not in person
so
we could use some help
and that ladies and gentlemen
is the best live stream you'll hear
today
um
george floyd didn't have a mask somebody
says
don't go outside problem solved
old care yeah older karen's don't care
how pretty the masculist woman is okay
that's a good point
if if the store manager is a karen
yeah it doesn't matter who's masterless
that's right
but most store owners don't necessarily
have a karen in charge it's usually an
old white guy
so you're fine
all right um
i think i'm gonna go do something else
and
that
