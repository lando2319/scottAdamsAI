wow
wow
like you made it
good job everybody you made it to the
best place in the universe and just in
time
what are the odds that you would have
the space and the time
correct
both of them space and time
very good because all of you are smarter
than the average person and you know
that there's no such thing as time
there's only space time yeah yeah re
remember to remind people that when they
talk about time say there's no time
time that's not even a thing listen to
some einstein sometime there's space
time sure but i didn't hear you talk
about space time did i
yeah don't be that person
but you can if you want me if you want
to be
now what would it take to make this
amazing amazing experience that we're
all about to
have together
and
no stop tingling stop stop some of you
are already getting chills don't don't
peek too soon stay with me stay with me
this is going to get so good so fast you
don't want to get ahead of me but all
you need is a copper mug glass a tanker
us dying to canteen junk flask vessel of
any kind any kind this time
fill it with your favorite liquid
i like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure unparalleled
it's called the simultaneous sip it's
going to happen now and it makes
everything better including your
antibodies watch watch go
antibodies
yeah
let me ask you this
how many of you believe
that hypnosis could improve your
antibodies
in the comments
without don't google it no cheating no
googling
how many of you think that hypnosis
could improve your antibodies
seeing some yeses
sings a nose
uh how about over on youtube i doubt
that
100 percent
here's the answer
it can
it turns out again
surprising right
now the way that it does it is probably
just by de-stressing you
okay now it sounds more it sounds more
realistic right yeah i don't think it's
a placebo
i think it works because if you
de-stress yourself you get
stronger immune response
is everybody on board with that simple
claim of fact
i think if you google it you'll see
plenty of support for the idea that if
you get rid of your stress your immune
system can be a little bit optimized
right
there's no doubt about that is there
and is there any doubt
that hypnosis could help you relax
not really i mean
hypnosis will work better with some
people than others but there's no such
thing as somebody who can sit there
quietly for 45 minutes listening to a
hypnotist and not come away a little bit
relaxed
right
i don't think in the history of hypnosis
i've never heard of an example
of somebody who became more anxious
because they got hypnotized i mean it's
a big world like i suppose it happened
somewhere maybe once
but
yes absolutely
hypnosis could improve your immune
response just by making it more relaxed
now could it do it more directly
i don't know
i don't know
because you know your your brain and
your body are
kind of
almost magical in the sense that we
don't understand how they work
i have a hypothesis that i've been
working on for years
that your intentions can change your
body state
your intentions
now i don't know that that's true
it's one of those things that it could
be false pattern recognition or
something
but it does feel
as though people's intentions end up
manifesting in some physical way just an
impression not based on any science or
anything like that
but i i would not rule out
the possibility that some people could
be directly hypnotized
to increase their
immune response i would guess maybe 20
of the public
because 20 is about the percentage they
have extreme
uh responses to hypnosis
so if the mind-body connection is what
we think it is there's probably some way
to
turn up the antibody production
part
you know if there's a brain connection
i'm not even sure if there is one
beyond the relaxation component
so anyway i just put that out there
because i was thinking of maybe doing
that
i could do a i could do a group hypnosis
now it wouldn't be as effective as one
person working with one subject because
if you're working with one person you
you adjust as you go to how they're
responding
but probably i could do a group hypnosis
someday i'd do a special live stream or
record it
and
if i worked on enough people you know
let's say i got
i don't know let's say i went a little
bit viral and we got 100 000 people to
watch it eventually
do you think that out of a hundred
thousand people
i couldn't raise the antibody count on
some of you
because i would take that back
i certainly wouldn't say it's going to
work on everybody
that would be kind of crazy
but if i do a hundred thousand people
and they just you know take the time to
sit through a hypnosis
induction and it won't be the kind of
hypnosis where you forget where you were
or you know i take insurance control of
your life and you send me money or
anything like that it would just be
relaxation just
pure relaxation i i'm seeing references
to uh
uh is it wim hoffman how do you say his
first say whim right
uh and he's yeah wim hof uh
so he's got a uh a method of breathing
which i hear good things about all the
time i'm pretty sure he's backed by
science i haven't looked at to it in
the depth that i need to
by the way you know i always tell you
that
uh
that i have this weird life
where it doesn't matter what story
you're talking about in the news
i have some connection to it
that's one of the reasons i think we
live in a simulation because it isn't
possible i could have so many
connections to so many stories so you
know you're talking about you know wim
hof
and
uh wim hof sorry
and i went to an event one time in san
francisco
uh before i'd heard of him or his method
and i was introduced to him and you know
i didn't know anybody else there at the
time and i guess he didn't know too many
people at the time or he wanted to talk
to me and i ended up chatting with him
for a
pretty long time and heard about his
methods in person which is weird because
i didn't know he was famous
i just thought he was a guy talking
about some breath control stuff and i
thought oh that's good
and then it turns out he was
he was wim off
so he turns out to be one of the most
well not one of the most famous person
associated with this breathing technique
uh but i didn't know it at the time
so is that the simulation
like how is it that i can keep meeting
people just by coincidence
that are at the center of
like all these big topics it's really
weird
because that was a completely random
encounter
well maybe not totally random all right
so how about california and the west
coast let me give you an update of how
we're doing
you know you've heard we've got problems
in california has anybody heard of that
uh we got your homelessness your high
taxes you got your drugs and your crime
you got your massive forest fires your
lack of electricity of course we've got
a drought and water shortage of pandemic
and runaway inflation
but if nothing else hits us i think we
can handle it
i mean we're a tough state
california is a tough state you can make
fun of us
sure but we're a tough state we can
handle homelessness taxes drugs crimes
forest fires lack of energy no water
pandemic runway inflation
and traffic we can handle that i just
hope nothing else is coming our way
let's check the headlines
okay there's a bomb cyclone coming our
way in california a bomb cyclone
so
i think we can conclude that california
has
pissed off god in some way that
is not entirely evident to me
uh
but it's obvious we're cursed at this
point
you know you could try to write this off
as science or coincidence but no
i think we're cursed
so the bomb cyclone's coming this way so
far the weather is uh
disturbingly not bad
so far it's just sort of a light rain
where i live i'm in northern california
just sort of a light rain
but i feel like it's going to get a lot
worse really quickly and probably today
but we need the water
so if the bomb cyclone
washes some things away but we get a lot
of water
probably we came out ahead all right we
got to talk about the alec baldwin
situation we know a little bit more
and i will tell you that um
as the story emerges you know the fog of
war starts clearing out let's see if
your opinion about the people involved
changes
now one thing we know is that the
young woman who is or the young bae i'll
say the young bae who was handling uh
the guns and who was in charge of the
safety of the guns for the
the film
apparently was not very experienced 24
years old and
doesn't seem to be a member of the nra
but that's just the guess
and i guess the circumstances are that
the gun had
either that gun or
ones in the group had misfired a couple
times
the crew had already complained about
the safety problems
and i guess the specific setup is that
they were lining up a camera shot
in which they wanted to have the camera
look down the barrel of the gun
or you know at least that view of the
the actor
and so alec baldwin was instructed to
aim the gun
in the direction of the camera ish
and it went off
now what's still missing in the story
unless somebody has heard it was
did he pull the trigger
how does a gun misfire in the first
place can is there anybody who
knows enough about firearms
to tell me how a
a gun would misfire
somebody said it didn't quote go off
yeah we'll talk about responsibility in
a moment
yeah the way the news is talking about
it is just
delay the ignition of the bullet
hmm
you got to pull the trigger somebody
says
it can't without the hammer striking
but what if now i
is there any chance that the hammer was
uh
pulled back
there's no evidence of that right so i
think there's a there's more news we
need to learn about this uh not that
that fact would necessarily change
what we think but
so
let's say if we were based on what we
know now
let's do a little speculating
if it's true
that alec baldwin was handed a gun
that and told there was cold
so he believed that it was blanks and if
he was told by the director who or the
director of photography i think it was
to point in that direction probably the
director said it as well
and he believed that the gun had been
checked out and it was just lighting it
up for a shoot
how guilty do you think he is
if the gun
um misfired
i don't know i don't even know what that
means to misfire
uh it was a revolver right yeah
um 100 guilty everybody says 100 guilty
100 guilty yeah the the nra answer to
that if i could put it that way you know
the gun owner answer
and i've been having this conversation
with
someone else
and
somebody was trying to
suggest i won't name names because i
don't want to bring in personalities but
um would suggest that the responsibility
was at least partially
at least partially
the
the gun armor person the person who was
in charge of making sure
it didn't have a loaded round
and what it what do you who actually
know about guns say to that
you say the same thing i said
it's a hundred percent the
responsibility the person has it in
their hand
even if
somebody else screwed up
we're all on the same page on that right
it's always 100
responsibility of the person with the
gun in their hand
always
it's never 99 it's always 100
it's also
100
of the person who handed it to him
so
if one person has a 100 responsibility
the person who has it in their hand that
doesn't absolve anybody else
you know they have their own kind of
responsibility
likewise if the person who handed it to
him is a hundred percent wrong
it doesn't change in any way
the actor's own responsibility now
i certainly feel for him because the the
context of how it happened
wasn't an ordinary gun ownership thing
he had delegated he had delegated
responsibility he thought that was good
enough it wasn't
it wasn't so let me ask you this
question
how many nra members would it have taken
to be on that crew
to have prevented this with with a
pretty high degree of confidence you
couldn't be sure
but how many would it take
anywhere on the crew and we'll even say
even say just the lowest member of the
crew you know somebody the the gaffers
or i don't know whoever is the lowest
member of the crew
yeah yeah everybody who understands guns
says the same answer won
exactly one
do you know what what would you have
done if you knew that this group of guns
had misfired twice
you would take them away
you'd probably take them away wouldn't
you
like physically take them away
now so i guess some people walked out
was that the right answer
i think walking out is what you do if
you're not a member of the nra
all right now of course i'm i'm being a
little hyperbolic you know in the real
world people don't have as much power as
they might want to
depends on personalities etc but i like
to think
that if there had been even one nro
member there
they would they would have just
gone nuts on that place
right the the amount of energy
somebody who knew what they were talking
about gun wise
would have put into that situation it
should be a lot
like i don't think it would have just
been talking to the director right i
don't think it would have been just
talking to the boss
i don't think it would have been just
complaining
i think they would have physically stood
in front of the guns
right
i think they would have stood in front
of the guns to say
for safety reasons nobody's getting near
these things
am i wrong
you put one nra member there doesn't
matter what their role is they would
walk and stand in front of the gun
supply and say no we're done here
these aren't going anywhere
right now you would have to have a
certain kind of personality to do that
you know certain risk profile
but i'd i'd like to know the answer to
the question if they had one nra member
just one
i'll bet the answer is no
you can't be sure but i'm bad
all right um if alec baldwin um
has responsibility obviously it would be
in the sense that he didn't put the
right people in charge he was the
producer
so i do think he's going to have some um
he's probably his insurance company or
he you're going to be on the on the hook
for a lot i think
but it will be an interesting
interesting case we'll probably learn a
lot
all right
i've been noticing with
happiness
that the internet dads are getting
pretty involved in the fentanyl question
do you know who the internet dads are
i use that term loosely to to include
people like myself now it's not my own
description of me
but it's other people's description of a
set of people
who
um somewhat accidentally nobody set out
to do this but became kind of um
almost dad-like influences
to people who maybe needed a little
extra or didn't have any you know i
would put mike cernovich in that
category put myself in that category
um you and you can name a bunch of other
people who who easily
feel like internet dads at this point
just giving you some earliest trying to
give you some life advice
and we see them getting more involved
lately in the fentanyl question i saw um
i saw uh
michael schellenberger is going at it
hard especially he's got a new book
san francisco
i want to get him on and do a book
review but i don't want to do that with
a live stream i'll have to do that off
off
off live
but you know the question is getting
bigger and bigger and the right people
are talking about it and i wanted to run
through for the benefit of my audience
yeah jack murphy another another good
example
i'm gonna run through this
uh a bunch of uh myths
that the internet dads don't have
right this is things that the
the people
you're calling the internet dads this is
stuff they understand
but maybe the public doesn't
okay
and so i just want to run through this
um and and i'll start with this i asked
this question on twitter and of course
it's an unscientific poll i said is your
life deeply constrained or ruined by a
drug addict or alcoholic who is close to
you
close to you right
how many people in my unscientific poll
which are mostly conservatives by the
way mostly conservatives that's the
people who follow me on twitter
uh if you're new to me i'm not i don't
identify as conservative but my audience
does
22 percent of them last i checked said
yes
22
have their lives deeply constrained or
ruined
deeply constrained or ruined
22
deeply constrained
or ruined 22 percent
do you feel that
you can't do anything to 22 percent of
the country
without a big effect on the rest of it
right there's nothing that affects that
many people that doesn't affect the rest
of you and keep in mind this is my
conservative followers
you don't think this is a little bit
worse on the left
so let's say let's say it's
a quarter of the public
is a dick is being influenced by
somebody addicted probably 10
or more are addicted to
how many people are addicted
does anybody know that
what percentage of the general
population are addicted
10 percent is it more now
i mean it could be 50 depending on what
drugs you're including you know if you
throw in cigarettes and alcohol and
everything else
um yeah i feel like it's
20 30 is what it feels like depending on
how you count it
but so that's how bad it is now let me
tell you the myths that people have
around there now that you know how big
it is
a lot a lot of people and you'll see
this on internet
will tell you that good parenting
will save your teen
good parenting
will keep your teen from getting into
trouble with fentanyl or overdosing
no
no that is a hard no
i do believe there are some edge cases
where maybe somebody's a little bit
inclined but you know the best parenting
in the world could
keep them safe
so yes
in the narrow narrow sense that there
are some kids and some families in some
specific situations
where doing all the right things
parent-wise would would help
so you should definitely try to do all
the right things pairwise
could help
but it would depend mostly on your kid
you think you can do you think you could
have taken my stepson
and and fixed him up
i'm going to tell you what that would
have looked like in a minute
because if you think
you could have fixed my stepson
by your good parenting
my god you haven't met many people
all right
so let me let me clear that up for you
in a minute
all right
here's some more myths
counseling would help get a good
therapist get a good counselor and they
can fix things nope
nope do you know why the counselor
doesn't help
i'm just going to use my my now deceased
stepson
as my example uh we're going to make you
go to counseling
i don't want to go to counseling we're
going to make you go to counseling
all right
but when i'm done i'm going to go back
to using
no we're going to make you go to
counseling and that would that will fix
you and then you won't use
okay
i'm just telling you that when i'm done
with the counseling i'm going to go back
to doing drugs and drinking and stuff
no the counseling counseling so you send
him to counselling he goes through the
hours
and the moment he walks out he uses
again just like he said exactly like you
said so now you're saying yourself all
right dealing with you like an adult
isn't going to work
all right we got to go we got to take
this to the next level
i'm going to start punishing you if
you're hanging around with the people
who use or we find out you're using or
we discover anything in your room right
we're gonna punish you until you stop
the behavior number one you're grounded
all right i'm gonna kill myself
i'm gonna kill myself because i'm
grounded
what if he's tried twice
what do you do what what what do you
good parents do all you smart ones
he's tried to kill himself twice real
like literally literally twice
so you're gonna lock him in his room he
says if he put me in here i'm gonna kill
myself
how's that your good parents you gonna
do that
how does that work take away his phone
he says i'm gonna kill myself
and you know what he means it
he means it he's not bluffing he tried
it twice
right how uncommon is it
for your addict to say they'll kill
themselves and mean it
not uncommon
how many of you have heard this this
it's not uncommon and it's real and they
will try to kill themselves
it's absolutely real and you know why
you know that they will try to kill
themselves
because their drug addiction is
basically slow suicide
they're already killing themselves you
don't have to wonder if they have the
mental state to kill themselves you're
watching it happen in real time they are
killing themselves it's just slow
and they're taking the chance that
they'll die and they don't care
did he care that he might die of an
overdose
he didn't
he didn't sometimes he would act like he
did
but honestly he didn't and you could
tell
how how soon did i know i would have a
addiction problem
with my stepson how young was he when i
knew
i'd have the problem
about five
about five years old it was obvious
you could see it coming
like a train because if five years old
he would tell us how much he wanted to
drink to oblivion
he's six years old still saying that
yeah i just want to drink till i pass
out can't wait to do drugs
he would say explicitly and often and
there was nothing you could do to talk
him out of it he was born to do drugs i
mean i've never seen anybody who was so
intent on doing everything wrong
secondly his personality was such
that if anything was the right thing
you're supposed to do he would do the
other thing and aggressively
it wouldn't matter what you told him
you'd say if you do this you're in big
trouble if you do this you're not
you do the big trouble thing every time
every time no exceptions
what do you do with that
all right so you say to yourself my god
you're gonna have to take it up to the
next level you're gonna have to actually
take him to some kind of facility
some kind of program where they're
really like you know maybe it's like
boot camp for kids or something you know
you've heard of these where they can
they they can sort of force the kid into
a situation where they can't leave and
you know they're going to really get the
tough love they need and they won't have
access to drugs so just sign them up for
one of the programs right
right
because that's all you got left
how many of you would say okay
um because most of you are second
guessing now i know so those are your
second guessing me how many of you say
that at this point
your your only thing you can do is to
sign them up for some kind of a tough
program where they basically would take
away his freedom for a while
but you know at least it would be tough
love and they'd give how many think
that's a good idea
no matter what you call it you could
call it military school or whatever you
want to call it but how many think
that's a good idea
i have to swear at you now
with with all due respect
i have to curse
there's no such thing
the thing you think will fix it doesn't
exist
there is no program that you can
take a california teenager too none
zero
nothing you have no legal recourse you
have no asset
no money in the world i could
have i could have taken five million
 dollars and put it toward this
problem
it would have made zero difference
there's no place you can take them no
facility exists no medical treatment no
path no person no expert
nothing you're on your own as a
parent
and you don't have anything you can do
except wait and watch
and prepare to bury your kid
that's all you have
you get that
now those of you saying but you know
screw the kid
free will it's his own fault
if you think that you don't know
anything about addicts you don't know
anything about human nature you don't
know anything about psychology and you
don't know anything about physics and
you don't know anything about psychology
but a lot of you have that
that feeling
no
people don't have free will to stop
drugs
it has to be done by somebody else
now some people can be
find themselves in this situation
in which they hit bottom
and then the situation has changed and
then sometimes they can get better on
their own but there's nothing you can do
you can't do that sometimes it happens
by accident and even you know it's not
good but it happens
but you can't make that happen you have
no ability
whatsoever
all right addicts do what addicts do and
you can't change it
that's it
all right um
other people say well you could at least
stay away from fentanyl
i mean you could at least make sure you
don't do any fentanyl no
you cannot the people dying of fentanyl
did not know it was in their products or
did not know how much of it was in their
products they thought they were doing
cocaine they thought they were doing
xanax or even they thought they were
doing fake xanax but they didn't think
it was fentanyl
they're doing other stuff and thinking
they're not getting fentanyl or if they
are their friend took it so it must be
okay and then they die
no you cannot avoid fentanyl if you're
an addict
if you're an addict you're going to take
drugs and it's going to be in the drugs
that's the whole story
you can say to yourself as i said to my
son
a few weeks before he died
i had lunch with him and i said promise
me just one thing
you won't take street drugs that you
don't know what's in them
that's the only thing i'm going to ask
because i feel like i could get that
from you
and he said yes
absolutely because i understand that the
street drugs very often have fentanyl in
them and i understand that fentanyl will
kill me so i will not take those drugs
and then he took those drugs and died a
few weeks later
um
here's the other big
big myth
you had good results with your kid
so therefore you know how to parent and
i don't
i'm sorry
if you had good results with your kid
you might be a great parent i wouldn't
take that away from you
but it's because you had a good kid
right
the kid
is what makes the thing turn out well
you could ruin it
but you're not really the one who's
making it happen right
the genetics of the kid and your
situation in general
are gonna be eighty percent of what
happens to that kid you're about twenty
percent tops
so how about a little humility about how
much you contributed although your genes
might be good
if if your genetics are the reason you
got a good result good for you but it
wasn't your parenting
your parenting could break something but
it's not going to fix an addict
um
all right
that's what i want to say in that topic
sorry that was such a downer but i think
it's important it's a downer but
important
all right do you remember um i've i've
given you some ways to predict things
some of them don't make any sense but
they're fun to watch one of the ways to
predict that doesn't make any sense
but it's very predictive or at least it
seems like it you know it's anecdotal so
maybe it's just confirmation bias
is that the best story usually wins
the best story usually wins so if like
say there's a competition of some kind
well let's say the best story is uh tom
brady
getting you know kicked off of his uh
football team that he's won a bunch of
championships on
he's way too old he goes to another team
that wasn't expected to win and he takes
him all the way to the super bowl and
beats his old team i don't know if that
happened exactly but i'm giving you an
example of something that if you saw it
developing you say oh you know the best
story here
the best story here would be if if this
aging hero had you know one more win
and then he does
and the number of times you you can say
you know the best the coolest outcome
here would be
and then you watch how often the coolest
outcome
happens
so i say this because uh raul davis
twitter user and ceo branding expert
had reminded me when i guess the world
series was on or the um
yeah is that right i don't watch sports
the world series just happened right
i think
but before it happened uh he mentioned
to me raul did
that
major league baseball had uh pulled the
game from the all-star game from atlanta
but then it was atlanta who was in the
world series and so raul said you know
the best story would be
that the all-star game gets pulled from
atlanta and then atlanta goes and wins
the wins the world series
oh is that wait am i reading the story
wrong
oh they responded with their first world
series does that mean that the world
series is going to be held there
as opposed to
oh so they're just in it
it's the playoffs that just happened oh
so it's the playoffs
so all right so i got the story wrong
that's how much of a not a sports guy i
am
um
so so they got into the world series
they haven't won the world series right
all right so if you were to predict
based on
based on best story wins you'd predict
they win
so thank you for correcting me so here's
another example of the you know i just
talked about this that collectively we
form sort of a brain like an
intelligence
you know i i have some general notions
and then you fix them or correct them or
refine them
it's really kind of interesting watching
literally a new form of intelligence
can has this ever existed before
because
technologically this couldn't have
existed before right at least not into
this scale
it's like how many people are watching
let's see we've got
uh 2100 over there and 500 here so let's
say you've got 2 700 people who are this
collective brain at the moment kind of
cool
anyway i don't i don't think there's any
reason that the best story always wins
except i'll speculate
if it's true
and if it were some way that you could
actually
you know measure it to see if it's true
i think it would be because
people are story
creatures
that we're also trained by stories maybe
naturally because we evolved that way
but also because we reinforce it by
reading stories and watching movies and
hearing stories so we're just story
people
and because we're story people we all
have a sense of what a good story is
right you can tell if the movie has a
good story or not everybody can tell
that
so i feel like we're all
biased toward making the better story
happen even if it's not good for us
oh yeah mcgregor didn't beat the boxer
yet that was that was a good example
although there was such a mismatch in
talent
that that that's probably you know the
exception to the rule kind of thing
yeah if there's a gigantic difference
in talent
yeah then it's not predictive
um
all right
so follow the money works that way too
um i won't give you the example but
recently there was an example where
something happened that wasn't because
of the money as far as i could tell
but the money would have predicted it
so watch how many times that happens
that somebody does something and you're
pretty sure it wasn't because of the
money
but coincidentally
it also was where the money would have
suggested things would have gone
it's it's almost an unbreakable pattern
joe desani's program would have fixed
scott's kids no it wouldn't because he
wouldn't have gotten in it
all right
all right here's a persuasion secret i
learned as a data analyst so i spent
many years in the corporate world
analyzing data and then explaining it to
management and whoever needed to see it
so my job was to take complicated things
and simplify them
so that somebody could make decisions
now
i apparently
was born with some kind of uh aptitude
for simplification
because you see that in all my work
so it seems like i have some kind of
natural talent for that i guess i mean
based on observation i would think so so
cartooning is about simplifying
writing well is about simplifying
and i would say that doing this is about
simplifying
well knowing when to expand and when to
simplify so it's a little more
complicated
but um
a good
data analysis visualization
puts you in charge
now here's something you've never you
most of you have never realized but i'll
bet so i'm going to ask the people who
who have corporate experience or big
organization experience so those of you
with corporate experience i need you to
back me on this because those of you who
don't have it aren't going to believe
this at all all right it's going to be
obvious to corporate people not obvious
to the rest of you
the person who makes the best
chart
is in control
that's your leader
the person who makes the best
visualization now when i say best i look
at all the yeses
so uh all the people with corporate
experience are agreeing you can see them
go by true true true
it's one of those things people don't
talk about
but it's true i'll give you an example
so when i was doing data analysis
uh i was in charge of uh the data
analysis to do a lease or purchase
for mainframes and servers and the
back-end technology for the bank
and so the technical people would say
you know what they needed and then they
would say we could get it this way or
that way we could lease it or buy it and
we could get it from ibm or somebody
else then i would take that information
and do the analysis and figure out
which one it was well as i was doing
that work i thought guys it's too
complicated to figure out what to do
when
and so i'll make a visualization that
shows all of our equipment that's coming
off lease
or is ready to be replaced and you'll
have a timeline that's you know a
three-dimensional timeline where you can
really really plan
you know when you're going to be
having to retire a lot of stuff
and and when you don't because if you
had to retire a lot of stuff you could
have a capital budget that
that was appropriate to how much had to
be replaced
now this didn't exist right there in
there was no existence of a good
visualization to show what to do when so
i took it to my boss and said hey i'd
like to show this to the senior vice
president in charge of everything
and uh you know show him that there's a
path to figuring out how to do this
these upgrades in a more rational way
my boss said
uh you know
nobody asked you to do that
and so you know
nobody asked you to do that right the
boss did not ask for this so i'm not
going to show him this
because he didn't ask for it but i was
persuasive they said you know
but he might like it
maybe you could just
pass it you know pass it across his desk
so she went to the meeting she uh did
hand it to him and he said
my god this is the first time i've
understood what's going on this is
perfect do more of this
and from that moment
who was in charge of deciding what
equipment in the bank got replaced
i was i was
accidentally i mean it wasn't my plan
but from the moment i was the one in
charge of the visualization
i was the one who determined what we did
from that point on
because i said well two years from now
you'd better make your budget x because
if you don't you won't have enough
right so who was in charge
was the senior vice president in charge
well on paper he was and he certainly
had an option of doing things that
didn't make sense he would have been
fired
but he had the option because he was in
charge but who was really in charge
the person who controlled the
information
and the person who put it in a form
that basically told you what to do
right
because once you knew that you had to
replace these in this day well you sort
of had to
his options were constrained
by what i allowed him to know
i was in charge now everybody who works
in the corporate office knows this
dynamic you know it's not the boss in
charge they're they're completely
captive to the data
so
let's look at the uh the question of the
supply chain
i believe that since we have a
leaderless situation in particular
we don't even know who's in charge of
fixing it right is it p buddha judge i
don't know
or is he in charge of some of it but not
all of it the states are mostly in
charge
i don't know do you so we have basically
a leaderless situation that's one of our
biggest problems
somebody
could take control of the situation with
one good visualization now i have in my
mind
a sense of what it might be but i'll
tell you what it doesn't look like
what it doesn't look like is the
visualizations i've seen so far the
visualizations i've seen so far are
treating all of the
the various variables as somewhat the
same
meaning here's a list of all the reasons
that we have a
we have a problem
it's just a list
a list of all the problems
doesn't do anything
because you don't know which ones are
the big ones
and even if you knew which ones are the
big ones are they the ones you can fix
or should you fix the little ones
because they're fixable
and at least you can do that
right a good visualization would answer
all those questions
a good visualization would show you
something like a visual presentation of
the the of the problem you know that
maybe in a in a linear fashion of things
go from here to here to here and then it
would have a sizing or possibly a color
indication
of where the big opportunities are and
maybe maybe different indications for
both
so it could be
that
there's a big problem so that would show
as a big bubble
but maybe there's nothing you could do
about it because you can't attack it
first
but maybe there's a smaller problem
that is easy to get at that would fix
the bigger problem if you could fix the
smaller one maybe that's what the
visualization would tell you
but here's the magic part suppose you
have the visualization with bubbles of
different colors and sizes to tell you
both priority and whether or not there's
something you can do about it
but also each one was labeled
with whose problem it is or who's in
charge
and you label the biggest one
nobody in charge
and you publish it
what happens
well if it becomes viral because it's
good right if it's not a really good
visualization nothing happens
so you have to make a distinction
between a bad visualization where
nothing happens and a great
visualization which people are capable
of doing right uh ian martizus if i
always pronounce your name right wrong
sorry
but ian if you've seen his work on here
um
regarding coven and stuff if you see a
professional data visualization person
work
it blows your freaking mind
right because you immediately realize
how good how not good you are at it i
did it for a living
right i did it for a living
and i'm not even close
to how good a good a really good
commercial
visualizer would do it now if somebody
could do that and label it that the
biggest problem is leaderless
what would happen
well the news would say oh i finally
understand this for the first time
and what things do the news report
does the news report things that the
reporters understand
or does the news report things that they
can't explain
which one do they prefer doing
okay obviously rhetorical question
reporters will report things they can
report and understand
if the data visualizer hands them that
they're all going to use it
they're all going to use it because
it'll be the first time they understand
it
if you could be the first person to
explain it to a journalist
you own the journalist
the journalist always owns the
politicians because the politicians have
to do things that will sound good when
they're explained in the press
or explain why they're not
right
so
if you don't understand how power works
and by the way i have this conversation
with a lot of people
a lot of people don't understand how
power works
they really don't they they imagine that
the person who's who's in the the box
that has the the job ceo they imagine
they have the power in many ways they do
but it's such a simplified understanding
of power
that you can really get off track here
here's the thing i say about the
uh
you know everybody's annoyed about the
uh the lockdowns and and everything
and they're saying oh our government
damn our government for requiring this
nothing like that is happening
not my world in my world the government
isn't making you do jacks yet nothing
your fellow citizens are making you do
that
do you not realize that it's not the
government at all doing it
it's your fellow citizens
if they did not support the government
it just wouldn't be happening
right you have to have some like solid
percentage of support or the government
can't make you do anything
if you think that convincing the
government to change their mind is a
productive path
you're so wrong
you have to convince the other citizens
because they're in charge
they're in charge
the government is not in charge of you
wearing a freaking mask
be serious wake up
they've never been in charge of that
they can't be in charge of that it's not
physically possible
your fellow citizens are in charge of
that
they've decided
by a large enough majority
that you're going to wear a mask for a
while in some places in other places
they decided not
in in florida apparently they decided
they're not going to wear masks
so stop thinking that the government's
in power
they're not never will be
all right
um
so if we could get a good data analysis
maybe we could fix this problem with the
ports and by the way some of that data
analysis might focus on
the the empty containers and by the and
i'm still seeing reports that it's not
the empty container problem
my belief is that the only credible
person says that is the problem that it
probably is at least in the west coast
other places may be different
all right
here's another one for you
dr anarchy on twitter
who is very well named
no no twitter user has ever had a more
appropriate handle he's dr anarchy not
his real name md
and the md part is what gives you the
anarchy in this so here's his tweet
i'm going to let you think about it for
a moment
and be careful
all right just think about it for a
moment before you react
here's the tweet
horse dewormer and anti-malaria drugs
have saved more lives than lockdowns and
masks
just just let it settle in
diabolical
[Laughter]
diabolical
here's what you might have assumed
until i warned you that there was a
trick coming
uh
horse dewormer and anti-malaria drugs
have in fact saved more lives because he
didn't specify covet
right he didn't specify covet it is
legitimately a fact that 100 of science
would agree with that horse dewormer and
anti-malaria drugs have saved more lives
than lockdowns and masks
it's probably i mean i assume the i
assume the data would back it up
but i you know we can't know that for
sure but what's diabolical about it is
first of all you don't know for sure
that that would even be true but second
you just leapt to the conclusion that he
was only talking about covet
but he didn't specify
so was he
i don't know
i don't know i'm not sure what he
intended which is what makes it so
diabolical
but
um
here's what uh you also need to know
um
and i'll give you a story here so
michael shellenberger was tweeting about
this today
that uh britain's climate policy rested
on the assumption
that in 2050 there would be just seven
days
per year when wind turbines produced
less than 10 percent of the potential
so the assumption is that
wind turbines would be a good deal for
great britain
because the wind mostly blows there
most of the time
but in 2021
there have already been 65
such days
and in 2016 there were 78 of them
all right they're hoping for seven and
they got 10 times as many
10 times as many
all right
so here's my
persuasion lesson for the day
any data analysis
has two parts
the data
and then the assumptions
so if you've got data and you've got
assumptions and you put them together
then you've got
a result
that you could just let's say let's say
the data is 100 accurate
and so you do the analysis with 100
accurate data
and let's say you're also good at math
and analysis so your your your math and
your analysis are spot on no mistakes
and the data which is weird is 100
perfect
so how good is your outcome
how good is your result
100 good data and 100
good analysis
anybody anybody how good is it
the correct answer is zero
no credibility whatsoever
because do you know what makes your
analysis come out the way
it comes out
your
assumptions your assumptions
every day every objective data analysis
except maybe randomized controlled
trials in some situation but as soon as
you get away from that
as soon as you get away from the
randomized controlled trials it's all
subjective
it's all subjective because somebody
picked the assumptions and whoever
picked the assumptions knew that if they
picked them differently
they'd get a different outcome
so whoever picks the assumptions decides
what the outcome is why do i know that
because that was my job for years my job
was data analysis in which some of it
was data
a lot of it was estimates and a lot of
it was assumptions and i could make a
command any way i wanted
it didn't matter what the analysis was i
could make it good or bad just by
changing the assumptions
i'm going to tell you something i did
that i'm not proud of
i don't know if i've ever said this in
public before i'm not proud of this
but it but it really happened
so when i was working for the phone
company and i was also doing dilbert in
my spare time my reputation as the
dilbert guy started climbing
so people knew that i was you know
mocking corporations at the same time i
was working for one well as you can
imagine this was not popular with at
least one member of senior management
who learned that i was mocking big
companies while working in his
organization
so he told my uh boss's boss to fire me
immediately because he heard i'd been
saying some things in public
uh about you know management in general
not not my management just about
managers and management
and to his credit
my
my boss's boss who was a let's say he
was a vice president i guess
the vice president
told me later i didn't know about it at
the time but he told me i don't know a
year or two later that he had been asked
to fire me and he talked he talked his
boss out of it and i didn't hear the
exact conversation but i think it went
like this he said no no no we we can't
fire him for having a sense of humor
you can't fire somebody for having an
opinion and you know being
let's say humorously
hyperbolic about it you don't fire
people for that
what you do is you move them onto
projects and they'll quit on their own
you just give them a really bad project
they'll quit on their own you don't want
to fire them for that
so i was moved no i don't know that that
conversation happened i do know
that i was instead of fired i was
transferred to a doomed project
now this is the way corporations
sometimes fire people they'll move you
to a project that has an end date
and then when the project is over they
say you know
we would love to put you back into some
other department but we've got a hiring
freeze on
so
everybody in the project is done working
at this company
yeah the special assignment so i always
put on a special assignment
with at least one other person who is in
the same boat
he was also just this close to being
fired but they said nah we won't fire
you you've been a good employee up till
now
so we'll put you on the doomed project
it'll take care of itself
guess what the doomed project was
it was our job to do an analysis of
whether the phone company should invest
i don't know some some billions of
dollars in a new technology called isdn
has anybody heard of it those of you who
were working in tech back in those days
now
how good was isdn i want you to watch
this in the comments watch this
for those of you who lived through those
times and especially those of you or
engineers or techies
how good was isdn and at the time did
you know it was the future
[Laughter]
it was absolute crap
it was probably one of the worst
technologies ever made
but it was the only thing that the phone
company had or thought they had as an
option for high-speed data and the phone
company thought they had to be in the
high-speed data business because they
kind of did
but they didn't have a good option they
just had this bad technology so they put
me in charge
of deciding whether they should do
isdn and spend billions of dollars in
making that like a critical part of the
business now keep in mind
that they had already decided they were
going to do it
because that's usually how it works so
management had decided they have to be
in the business of high-speed data they
only had one option it was going to be
isdn but they needed somebody
my project to say they were making the
right decision
well at this point
i knew my
career was pretty much over
and i was not too happy with my employer
how do you think the analysis went
well i recall giving the presentation
and it's probably the funniest thing
i've ever done that nobody laughed at
are you ready
the funniest thing i've ever done
that nobody laughed at
i stood in front of the senior
management of uh you know as an svp and
vp's senior management to make these
billion dollar decisions
billion dollar decisions and i gave him
my powerpoint presentation and i said
this isdn
would be a great thing
this could be great
but i have to tell you my assumptions
you have to understand the assumptions
because otherwise the analysis you know
depends on that so you have to
understand them and one of my
assumptions was
that the employees of the phone company
worked flawlessly
as did the developers of isdn
and if they didn't make any mistakes
in their implementation or the decisions
and if isdn
which was crap at the moment and had
been crap for a long time
were to become not crap because the
people made all the right decisions from
that point on isdn would be an excellent
thing to do
under the condition that my co-workers
were
capable and competent
and
mr senior vice president you know your
people better than i do
so if you trust them to be capable and
competent this is a great thing to do
it's probably that it's probably the
most up thing i've ever done in
my life
but in my defense
they did have it coming
they had it come
now remember they had already made the
decision
so it didn't really matter what i
analyzed but i gave them the cover they
needed
because
i didn't care
i just didn't care so if i could give
some corporate advice
don't put the guy you're trying to fire
and he knows it
on the biggest decision in your company
because it was
it was the biggest decision in the
company
and i gave them exactly what they asked
for
i gave them my assumption and i said it
clearly if you believe your your people
can execute flawlessly unlike anything
they've ever done before
this is a good idea you should you
should jump at it
and they did
so uh all of you are using isdn now
right
how's your is-10 connection working
pretty well i guess that's everywhere
so there's your
now
so that was real that's a that's a real
life story now every time you see a data
analysis what do you think
right
you can ask yourself who did it and what
assumptions did they make and what are
they trying to accomplish because people
got priorities and it might not be yours
all right
um here's a data analysis
test for you i gave this test to people
online today we'll see how you do
it's a data analysis test i'm going to
give you a
uh an assumption so don't
don't argue with the assumptions because
these are not real assumptions
it's just if this were true all right so
don't argue that it's not true
that's not the question
if it were true
can you do the analysis all right so
we're only testing your analytical
ability we're not testing the facts i
stipulate the facts are true
they might not be but let's act like
they are
and then do the analysis here it is
uh if you knew now new is critical right
if you knew there's no doubt about it
because you're magic and you know if you
knew that 98 of the people with coven 19
who took ivermectin
had a good outcome
would you conclude it worked 98 of the
people taking it have a good outcome go
do you conclude it works
well your answers are all over the place
i see yeses and no's how could that be
how could this simple question have
different answers
this is the most basic question
98 of the people who took this drug had
a good outcome are you telling me that
doesn't convince you
what would it take
if 98
is not enough what would it take
how many how many of you uh said yes
that's pretty good evidence it works and
are feeling a little uncertain right now
how many of you are saying yes
but feeling maybe not as confident as
you used to be in that opinion
and i'm going to read it again because
you have to listen to all the words
right
so remember the part that's stipulated
is true you can't you can't question
this because we're only looking at the
analysis not the data
if you knew that 98 of the people with
covid who took ivermectin had a good
outcome would you conclude
it worked
now now you thought about it for a
minute and you've seen other people's
answers right
now now show me just the yeses
you had a moment to think about it and
you've seen other people's responses now
just the yeses
plenty of yeses
lots of yeses
okay
those of you who are saying yes are
going to get a little dose of humility
today and i don't mean this to be
condescending all right so don't take
this personally
how many of you could uh design a
a nuclear-powered rocket without any
help
well i couldn't i couldn't because i
don't have any training in that
how many of you could
shoot a three-point shot from the center
of the court and make them as much as
stephen curry
i can't i can't i don't have any
practice of that nothing
so i don't feel bad about it right i
don't feel bad that i'm not a physicist
i've never tried
never been trained
so
very few of you have been trained in
data analysis i i figure right
realistically so if you've never been
trained in data analysis and you have
completely the wrong answer don't feel
bad about it okay
why am i telling you that
because i wanna
i'm gonna try to turn off the trigger
for cognitive dissonance
the trigger would be feeling you're
wrong
that would in theory that would trigger
you into hearing and thinking things
that are incorrect so i'm going to turn
it off
if you're not
experienced expert in data analysis
there isn't any chance you'd be good at
it so if you got this question wrong
don't feel bad about yourself
there's nothing wrong with you you're
perfectly fine human
you're going to get a little better in
the moment because i'm going to explain
to you what you got wrong but very few
people know how to analyze data they
think they do it it's misleading you
know the the reporters will give you
data and you think they know what
they're talking about they don't
they don't
all right here's the answer um for those
of you
who are maybe experienced in data
analysis
if ivecton gave a good outcome to 98 of
the people you would indicate it's
probably bad for you
all right
again
remember if this is different than what
you thought there's nothing wrong with
you
you're still good you're just not
experienced at data analysis
the the the setup i gave you
should indicate
under the following assumption if it was
given to a broad spectrum of the public
that represented the public
98 is worse than nothing
if you gave people nothing more than 98
of them would have a good outcome
if you didn't do anything
so if ivermectin gave them a 98
good outcome and doing nothing
gave you slightly better than 98 percent
what does that tell you about ivermectin
that would tell you it's bad for you
right now remember i made up the i'm
making up the numbers this is not
anything real right nothing real this is
just
an example
now
the second thing you should have asked
is who did you study
because if the only people studied had
been 80 year old people who had coveted
and took no other drug
it would be a miracle drug right
if if the 80 year olds had taken no
other drug and only ivermectin had a 98
good outcome that would be a miracle a
miracle drug
but suppose the only people study were
children under 18
and 98 had a good outcome
don't give them don't give them any
ivormectin
if that's all you know
because they were going to do better
than that without the ivermectin so you
took a
99 point whatever percentage good
outcome and you took it all the way down
to 98 with your ivermectin
so if you don't know who you gave it to
you don't know anything
right
somebody says you killed several
children yeah
so
um
let me say as clearly as possible i
don't know if um
i i don't know if ivermectin works
okay
i don't
discount it
but i don't think the data is supporting
it
now the only thing that i want you to
learn has nothing to do with ivermectin
all right so this conversation is not
about ivermectin please all right i'm
not talking about ivermectin it was just
an example
to see if if
people who don't have data analysis
training
would automatically get exactly the
wrong answer
and that's what happened
so
um all i wanted to transmit is some
humility
that i would say you know even as an
experienced so i would i would label
myself a commercial grade
analyst
meaning i did it for money somebody was
willing to pay me
for my ability to analyze things right
and even i get stuff wrong all the time
all the time i guess stuff wrong so i've
got a great deal of humility about my
own ability and i'm pretty trained
right i'm pretty well trained
if you're not trained and you don't have
a really big dose of humility about how
well you can analyze this stuff
you should get it
all right
i'm seeing
christopher is sending me a
article from jim hoft says election
expert seth keshel
releases national fraud numbers
finds 8.1 million excess votes in u.s
elections
affirms trump won etc what credibility
do you put on that story people
is from the gateway pundit jim hoft
and he says that some expert has found
8.1 million excess votes and it shows
that trump really won
credibility
everybody credibility
good job
good job
yeah
zero or low
right
zero or low
now it doesn't mean it's untrue
right remember when i say credibility
and i think you're all you're all
trained on this by now
credibility doesn't have anything to do
with true or false it's just whether the
the source and the way it comes to you
is something you should automatically
believe or automatically be skeptical
could be true
we're not ruling it out at all but at
the moment
on first glance it's about a zero
credibility
if if you see it in other places and you
see more detail
maybe maybe it'll go up
so again doesn't mean it's not true
but i wouldn't uh get too excited about
it
um
here's some good news from uh twitter
user jml
um he talked about ivory mechan and he
said and i quote from his tweet i took
it and got better in 46 hours it works
incredible
now that is good news because um you
probably are aware that there are some
randomized controlled trials going on
for ivermectin
and we can cancel those now
because they're expensive they're going
to take a long time but now that we know
that this
one person
is pretty sure that it works incredible
and it wasn't just another one of the
millions and millions and millions of
cases of people who
did have one day that they felt better
a little bit more than the other days
so it's not that but this one person
he's now tested on himself and that
gives us
full scientific confidence
so thank you jml for making it
unnecessary to do a
controlled drug trials we can just give
it to this guy
and i don't know how many other drugs
he's willing to test for us but imagine
how much money we could save
a randomized controlled drug style is
like crazy expensive we're talking
like tens of millions of dollars maybe
hundreds of millions
but we can save all of that by just
giving these drugs to
jml
46 hours later you're going to know if
they work he'll just tell you
and then you just take them to market we
could save
a lot of money that's the best news i've
heard all day
i hope he doesn't charge too much for
his services
so that would be great all right
what else has happened
uh was it wrong of joe rogan to take
ivermectin
i will give you the
correct analytical decision
it's a risk management decision
because you don't know
if his doctor gave it to him that means
that somebody well informed
that he trusts
thought the risk management balance was
worth it because i guess the downside
risk is
kind of
pretty close to zero
did it work nobody knows
nobody knows
but was it a good risk management
decision it looks like it
it looks like it
that doesn't mean you should do it
but if your doctor backs you up
that would help if your doctor says no
well
you know take that under consideration
doesn't mean you have to follow the
doctor's advice
but i would certainly give us some
weight
i certainly would
um
scott just called dr corey well informed
yes
yes you the
the rogue doctors who are claiming the
opposite of the consensus they are well
informed that doesn't mean they're right
they just know a lot of stuff you don't
know definitely doesn't mean they're
right
have any weed users died of covet i'd
really like to know that because you
know weed has been at least indicated in
in some
non-confirmed trials weed has indicated
as a protective
effect now i can't speak for the rest of
you
but if covet if coven 19 can burrow
through the solid layer of marijuana tar
that i put on my lungs every day
well it deserves to kill me i would say
that's a fair fight
i'd say if you if you could get through
that barrier
and you can take me out
good job on you covid you have my
respect
but
you're gonna have to you have to dig
pretty hard
to find lung
[Laughter]
now i don't know if many of you know it
but
the only studies i've seen
about
lung cancer and health
outcomes
for continuous smokers such as myself
the only uh
the only health a study i've seen is
that they have the same life expectancy
as everybody else
will the masked mandate stop before
august 2022
oh yeah i think so
what's happening in florida by the way
think about how how confident you were
about whatever you thought some other
country or state did
did you ever have a period during the
pandemic where you said oh
sweden the sweden example now we know
what's going on
that tells me something i'll look at
sweden then i'll look at what other
people will do and now i'll know what's
going on
pretty pretty clearly isolating the
variables that matter and the ones that
don't now that i know what's happening
in sweden we're good
any of you had that feeling
well i didn't how about when you heard
that india allegedly had one region that
had like amazing success
with ivory mechtin
so did you believe that
you shouldn't you shouldn't because
there's no reliable information that
india has success with ivormectin you
think it is you probably saw it in a
tweet or you saw an article completely
debunked
how about the difference between florida
and california
florida's infection rate just dropped to
sort of a
one of the best meaning the lowest level
since the beginning of the pandemic
why
why did that happen
does anybody have any explanation
for why florida suddenly has fewer
infections
somebody says seasonality but that
hasn't held
seasonality has not acted the way
seasonality normally acts
the the seasonality has been violated by
this virus
right sunshine california we got
sunshine so every every uh every
hypothesis you have doesn't seem to
stand up
does it
i don't know what it is
apparently there's something pretty
basic about this virus that we still
don't know the experts still don't know
because we can't predict any state can
we
do you think any expert could predict
okay this state
is now going to make a change in their
their procedures
and then can the experts predict how
it'll
go apparently not probably not now the
one exception to that would be christmas
i think
christmas seems predictable doesn't it
but beyond that i don't think you can
compare
a state to a state we just don't know
what's going on
and i'll tell you what makes me super
curious
is why is it that we get a bad
variant
just about when we think we got the
other one under control is it
is that a coincidence
because if one virus was created
in a lab
wouldn't they make it a variant too
don't you think there was more than one
created in the lab are we sure the delta
variant is natural
and are we sure the one after that
whatever they're talking about the one
that looks a little like it might be a
problem
are we sure that's natural how would you
know
oh somebody's saying maybe the vaccines
caused it i don't think there's any
evidence for that that the vaccines
cause the variant
um the the evidence is this
the greater amount of
virus there is causes the variant not
the leaky vaccines
so everybody's saying leaky vaccines do
a little uh do a fact check on that i
think the leaky vaccine
hypothesis
that that actually causes variance i
think that's completely debunked
by the fact that the thing that causes
mutations is more virus
so the more virus the worse it is just
period
that's just the only rule you need to
know more virus more variance that's all
you need to know now the exception would
be
if people got partially
let's say immunized by the in the prior
infection
at which point the the variant wouldn't
be as powerful if if your infection
if your natural immunity also worked
against the variant it could stop it
that way
um
natural mutations more patients survive
to pass along mutations
uh
okay
um here's another uh
what time is it i've got time this
morning you want to hear another
conspiracy theory
anybody anybody another conspiracy yeah
of course you do of course you do
goes like this
the supply chain problem
isn't natural
or was it
maybe nudged by an adversary
question number one
could you tell the difference
if it was natural the supply chain
problem or if there had been some hidden
hand
behind it would you know the
difference first answer i think no you
could i mean it's possible you'd see
some hidden hand that wasn't so hidden
but could could an adversary do an
attack like this that we would not be
able to identify
yes
yes
let me give you an example
of how this could be done by an
adversary
over a long period of time
and you wouldn't know it you ready
one of the biggest problems in as i
understand it and my example might be
wrong but it'll give you an idea right
even if the example details wrong so in
long beach and i think in la they had a
restriction about storing the empty
containers
at some point that means that somebody
brought forth
legislation or some kind of rule change
to promote the rules about restricting
what you can do with an empty
now you probably think oh that was the
unions
and probably was
or that was just uh ordinary safety
procedures and of course we did that you
know there were some accidents so it's
just because of the excellence
could be
here's the other possibility
how much would it cost
to bribe a local official to make some
legislation
that isn't really as good as
you think it is for the public
thirty thousand dollars
all right now you can fact check that
but my claim just for conversation
for conversation purposes alone
it would cost about thirty thousand
dollars
to bribe one politician
it doesn't have to be even a direct
bribe it could be
you know we'll fund your campaign or
something like that
um
one politician thirty thousand dollars
to put some legislation in place about
empty containers
now
do you have to bribe all the people who
vote
on the on the bill
do you have to bribe them all
nope
because they don't care about empty
containers do they
it's not an important topic
so if the person who alleges he or she
looked into the topic and said look i've
looked into this deeply
i wrote it all for you made it easy uh
this this problem of putting more than
two containers on top is a big problem
vote for my bill
do you think do you think one person
could get something passed if they were
the only person who understood the topic
yes
yes they could
now
suppose an adversary was doing this kind
of thing finding weak spots in our major
systems
and then influencing one politician
to become an expert in it
and put in place
a restrictive policy
that looks good when people see it at
first
oh you're going to improve the safety
yeah i'm on board i'm good with safety
oh
you're going to protect the unions oh
well we're a democratic state and we
like unions we'd better get them on our
side so sure
yeah it could be done
now you say to yourself but that's like
kind of a magic bullet isn't it scott
you really think
that the chinese government is so smart
that they're looking for this weakness
and they find this one person is exactly
the right person and they do exactly the
right thing and
no
no that's not the play
the play
would be you do that same thing you know
the bribe the politician
but you do it all over the place
so it's not just about ports and it's
not just about the supply chain
it's about everything
it's about how we procure for the
military
it's about our policy for whether we
should have domestic supplies of this or
that valuable stuff
it's about how quickly we could
let's say put together a military
response maybe maybe crippling little
places of it with restrictions and rules
so they would put in place a whole bunch
of things that look like little steps
and then wait for the pandemic
now when i say wait for the pandemic i
mean wait for any big thing
that is the extra the extra pressure on
the system
so they could just weaken a bunch of
systems
over 20 years
at very low cost
and then wait for some pressure on the
systems that they didn't plan for but
there's always some pressure and then
that's enough to knock it over so it
could be that an adversary didn't even
know they were gonna have success with a
supply chain it just they had weakened a
bunch of stuff and this is the one that
got some extra pressure and pushed it
over
now
when you hear it described this way does
it sound impractical
anybody
does anybody think that any of that
sounds impractical
no
unfortunately no and i gave you only one
very small example
of something that could be very easily
and practically done
don't you think there are more
that don't involve bribing a politician
don't you think now let me give you
another one
um
what did i hear there was there was some
propaganda
that we all accepted
i just heard a story about some
propaganda that the united the citizens
of the united states all accepted as
true and just was made up by some
propaganda source
do you think that an adversary
could convince us of something that
isn't true
just in general
could an adversary use let's say
maybe ai through through just algorithms
not not anything more ai than algorithms
or
you know
let's say changing your social media
impressions
so you see more of something and less of
something else do you think they could
change your mind about anything
of course they could
now if they're trying to change your
mind about who to vote for
where we can be sort of alert to that
you're like hey you're a bot
the way you're talking i can tell you're
a bot or that sounds like a chinese spy
but
would you be just as smart
if the topic was
storing nuclear waste
whether to regulate
electric cars
or something like that would you be just
as smart and say yeah my opinion on
on batteries versus
storing nuclear waste is based on my own
research
and my own knowledge of objective
sources and at least they're american
even if they're trying to bias me so i
have an american objective opinion
maybe
but you don't think your foreign
adversary could get 20 of you so afraid
of any one of these things that that 20
would form an action group to stop it
from happening or would promote
legislation that would at least have a
chance of passing
there are so many ways
that a clever and patient adversary
could influence or i'll say nudge
could nudge each of the
parts of the system and just wait for
something big to be the the last straw
right
now when you when you hear me describe
it this way
and then you think of the um
you think of the supply chain problems
are you still confident that it happened
naturally
how many of you are confident
that it's a natural effect because all
the things we talk about look natural
but they're all caused by something else
which was caused by something else which
was caused by something else
so if you say to yourself scott scott we
know the problem the problem is just too
many empty containers
and and there's a regulation that's it
that's the whole problem
is it
i don't know
who knows maybe that's the problem that
was caused by a problem before it
because it didn't happen on its own
and whatever the problem before it was
that was
caused by the thing that happened before
it
you have no idea what caused any of this
there is a reason
that the news is not telling you what's
going on with the supply chain you've
noticed that right
have you noticed that the news
can't tell you exactly what's wrong
just that it is wrong hey there's lots
of ships backed up
you don't have your supplies
that's all they could tell you
it took a private citizen to go down
there and
uh look at the the problem
i'm very suspicious of a problem that
has too many explanations
because it's not like we we lack
explanations the problem is we have too
many we got the trucker shortage the
truck shortage the regulations about
what trucks you can use you got the
you know the too much demand because the
pandemic you've got people who don't
want to get vaccinations so they're not
working you've got union problems
i don't know
i i understand the concept that when the
system fails you see failures all over
it
okay i get that
but
my pattern recognition is picking up
something else
you know do you know that
do you know the book by malcolm gladwell
blink
and he talks about the idea that an
expert
can know something's true before they
know why
the example he gives is
a our expert looking at a forgery
the the expert could look at the forgery
and say ah that's a fake
but if you ask them why they'd have to
think about it well i don't know
i guess if i thought about it i know
this part looks a little different than
the one
they wouldn't know
that's the experience i'm having with
the supply chain problem
it looks like a forgery
i don't know why like i couldn't give
you a detail
but it doesn't look like a genuine event
to me it looks like a forgery
part of it is that we don't know what
the problem is and we should
part of it is we know that china would
have an incentive to mess with us in a
variety of ways part of it is i know
it's practical it could be done
and part of it is i know that such
things are done
like it's a real thing that is done in
the real world right
it's not like i invented an idea and
nobody thought of it it's some it's
something that's happening
you know i'm sure we're doing it we the
united states you don't think we're
putting a little uh pressure on things
so
um i do not allege
that anybody is behind the supply chain
problem
let me be clear i make no allegation
that that it's some kind of a foreign
attack
the argument against it is that it would
affect china as well
and it's hard to imagine that they know
it's going to be a good outcome
that would be a pretty risky play
but
i can't turn off the fact that like my
my spider sense is just on full alert
here now it could be that the only thing
going on is that the real problem is
still not surfaced
like we think it has but maybe there's a
deeper problem below the problem below
the problem so it could be
that all i'm re that all i'm reacting to
is the fact that there's an obvious
mystery here
right
would you agree with me on that
that there's a mystery here
it's not explained i don't think
i see people say they think it affects
china the most in the long run i think
it would but they might also calculate
that they could survive it better i
don't know
um
well
i'm seeing somebody say it's a comedy of
errors because only seven cranes are
working but the reason the cranes can't
work is because there's no room
because there are too many empties on
the in the port
so it's not the crane problem i think we
can eliminate cranes as
as the source of the problem
all right so here's another suggestion
um
let's say you put the empties on a train
with a crane
is there a train that goes right to
how close can you get um a train that
would carry empties uh containers how
close can you get a train to one of the
ports
do they already have close trains
because i'm wondering if you couldn't
take one of those cranes
and put it like a mile away from the
port and wherever there's a big field or
something and just have the plane have
the train go one mile
unload it go back one mile load it up go
one mile and unload it into a field
probably there's a distance problem i
don't think that would work
logging helicopters
logging helicopters because they could
lift a container could they
would they be big enough to lift a full
container
maybe but i think that would be
that would be super expensive but i
don't even know how fast it would be
load the empties back in the ship i
don't understand all the regulatory
problems with that
but i don't think that's as easy as you
think
all right i think that's all i have to
say
question
was today's um
i got a comment today on twitter
that when i asked my trick question
about the ivermectin 98 thing which i
just made up
um
a twitter user said
people don't like to learn things that
way
because it was like a trick question and
i trapped you into it
how many of you
had a negative reaction to that
did anybody have a negative reaction
to the way i set that tweet up with a 98
or or did you
because what i was shooting for i don't
know if i hit it
but what i was shooting for
is do you feel for at least some of you
to feel your certainty evaporate
that's all i wanted i just want your
certainty to evaporate
okay so so most of you were not bothered
by good i just wanted to check in on
that because if the only thing it did
was irritate you it wasn't persuasive
all right good
good to know let me ask you this how
many learned something useful
useful maybe just in understanding the
world not necessarily how many learned
something useful today
lots of yeses over on
locals
about youtube
i i pissed one of you off
uh
seeing lots of yeses uh allah learn
nothing
those of you who learn nothing
you're very smart people i could
probably learn something from you
uh only the last 30 minutes was good
okay good feedback
um
a bit
all right good
so here's here's uh i finally decided
what my
my role is
if you'd like to hear it
i think my role is to teach you to be
more effective
persuasion would be just one way
but i think what i've sort of
accidentally stumbled on is a way to use
the headlines for
your personal improvement
i don't know anybody's done that before
and i didn't do it intentionally i just
sort of drifted here and thought hey
i just realized that i'm using the
headlines
as a as a like a honeypot
like i'm trapping you in here with the
headlines because that's why you were
interested in it's like oh let's hear
about alec
what's he what's he going to say about
alec baldwin and then once you're
trapped in here on the headlines which
is automatically interesting i try to
talk about them specifically in a way
that gives you some kind of life skill
when you're done
and i i only realized this yesterday
isn't that weird i mean
this is the the thing about framing
until you frame something right you
don't really understand it and i had
been framing this as sort of a
a mishmash
that it like i was just doing the things
i liked i like to talk about the news i
like talking about self-improvement and
you know sometimes i'm selling a book
about those things
so i just sort of drifted here i didn't
realize that i'd accidentally hit a
model a business model
and the business model completely
accidentally
is draw you in with the headlines and
teach you something so you feel like you
got something in it
now
i wonder if i could have thought of that
and then executed it or i had to drift
into it
it feels like it would have been
maybe a different result if i'd gone at
it a different way
and this gets to
what is this a good example of
that i always talk about
systems over goals
did i have a goal of creating this
business model
nope
never i never even really thought of it
this way until literally yesterday
literally yesterday it's the first time
i realized what it what we had
collectively
created
because i don't i don't even take credit
for even drifting into it because most
of you sort of nudged me into it right
here's a question
are you my creation
meaning that i've influenced you some
way
large or small or am i your creation
am i your creation or are you my
creation
this gets back to the question of power
and understanding who has the power
if you don't think you've influenced me
more than i've influenced you most of
you some of you maybe a lot
yeah it's a two-way street
but your control over me is extreme
extreme how many times have you seen
one comment completely changed my game
right those of you have been watching
for a while how many times have you seen
it just one comment
just totally changed my game
all the time
all the time right all the time
so
if you when you're analyzing how much
personal power you have
consider that you have all of mine
you have all of my power
people every day somebody sends me a
tweet that they hope i'll retweet
and every day i retweet some of them
so all of those people got to use all of
my power
but it wasn't mine anyway it was
borrowed
all of my powers borrowed like i don't
even see it as real
like i don't i don't i don't internalize
it as me having power
i internalize that as being part of a
system
and when the system is working i'm doing
my part
but i'm not the power source
more like a conduit and a filter maybe
i'm a filter and a
conduit and i you know i add a little
power
but so do all of you
all right so i try to model the stuff
that's most useful as well um
bring back your democratic friend i had
to cut him off entirely
uh watch it you babbling
yeah i think we're at the babbling part
of the presentation so
i will uh let you go and let's do
something else today okay
bye for now
oh uh walter says how do i if i log into
locals how do i find the link
to all the micro lessons unfortunately i
don't have a link to it
but if you uh
you can find the content list and then
you can also do a search on the phrase
micro list so just use the search bar
and search for my content under micro
lesson just that phrase and they'll pop
right up micro lesson
uh there is also an index
which
i probably should retweet
right but there is an index for them but
it would be better if you just search
for them all right thanks for that and
i'll talk to you later
