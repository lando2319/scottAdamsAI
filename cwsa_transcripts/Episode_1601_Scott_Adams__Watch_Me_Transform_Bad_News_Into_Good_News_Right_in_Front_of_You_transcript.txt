morning everybody and welcome
to the highlight of your life
it's called coffee with scott adams and
i know yesterday was amazing but it just
gets better every day it does
and if you'd like to take it up to the
final level of
awesomeness
well why wouldn't you all you need is a
cover mug or glass a tanker gel system a
canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind
fill it with your favorite liquid
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure
it's the dopamine of the day
it's the thing that makes everything
better
including the pandemic here it comes the
simultaneous sip
oh yeah
may i share with you
the strangest thing that happened to me
yesterday
the strangest thing
all right goes like this
some of you know i've been trying to
learn to play the drums and part of that
process is i'll hear a song
or i'll remember a song that had some
good drums in it and i'll try to learn
just that that little bit of the fun
part of the drums
and
one of my favorite old times uh
songs
was a white rabbit by the jefferson
airplane
and uh the white rabbit has a drum
opening
where there's like
you know there's sort of a quick drum
rolls in a number of places and so
yesterday i i guess it was yesterday
morning i was practicing the white
rabbit drum rolls
and i was just playing white rabbit
white rabbit white rabbit over and over
again and just practicing it
so that's the first part of the story
now have i ever done that before
nope nope i've never
i've never before been interested in
playing
anything about that song white rabbit
just i like the drums
so i decided to watch the uh matrix
uh the new matrix uh sequel
and uh
there's a of course the matrix is about
um
it used to be about a a hacker
you remember when neo in the movies he
was a hacker but he has been reimagined
and i don't want to give away
i'll try to do this without giving away
any plot right but it doesn't give away
anything to say that he's been
reimagined as a
game designer
a game designer
so neo's job is a little bit closer to
mine now
because he it's more about imagination
and creating a story and
with you know with characters that are
designed which is what i do for a living
interesting
and interestingly i just been you know
sort of teasing in the
in public uh because elon musk who is
the big proponent of the simulation idea
tweeted that you know feels like he's in
a dilbert comic which is weird because
that would make me the author
of the simulation
that elon musk is in
who is the biggest voice about the
simulation
so it was like okay this is making my
brain hurt there are too many levels
here
how many of you saw the matrix yesterday
when it came out
do you already know what where i'm going
with this
okay to tell you that this movie
mapped my life
would be an understatement
first of all the song white rabbit is
prominent prominently a part of the
movie
i had no idea
so i'm watching a movie about the
simulation while talking about the
simulation
and there's the very song
and it's it's not it's not just in the
background it's like a featured
element of the movie
and
also there were two names in the movie
that
had a lot of uh direct
recent impact on me i won't give you the
names but there were two names that i
had some history with just recently
that are characters in the movie
i'm like that is weird
and uh
here's the first here's the thing that i
finally figured out
you know in the movie neo is called the
one
did you ever figure out what that means
neo is the
one or or is he yeah that's part of the
question or is he not everybody believes
he is
but
what about trinity
if neo is the one
what is trinity
the zero
she's the zero
now watch the movie and just remember i
just said that
neo is the
one but trinity is the zero
that's all you need
it's all you need
and i never realized that when they were
saying that neo was the one
i never realized they had that second
meaning now the movie doesn't say what
i'm saying so that's not a spoiler i'm
putting my own interpretation on it
that's that's not giving anything away
yeah neo is the one
but trinity is the zero
that's all you need
interesting anyway um i saw some bad
reviews for the movie but i have to say
i loved it
uh now i'm a big fan of the the whole
series and of course the concept of it
just blows my mind
but um
i recommend it if you like sci-fi and
you like the first three this is a real
fun trip
uh but i can see why i can see why the
critics had their problems with it but i
liked it
um
i say the pandemic is over for all
practical purposes
when the reports about the pandemic no
longer even mention
deaths
and so you're seeing tweets today about
the omicron
you know burning through the population
and spreading like crazy and we're going
to have
peaks and we're already seeing surges
and
and our holiday plans are going to be
more surges and you read it
and there's no mention of death
now these are tweets but then go to the
news
and read a news story about the pandemic
no mention of death
death
stopped being
news
now
i'm still going to stick with uh the
greg guffeld uh
promoted february one
um if you haven't watched the five if
you know uh greg is uh pushing
february one as am i
co-pushers of february 1 trying to get
the idea that the government needs to
have some kind of a focused target
which of course is subject to revision
like any target would be
but
after we get past this surge from the
holidays that we know is coming
we really have to have a conversation
with our government about getting back
to normal life
and uh
i think things are looking really good
for february 1. now i know a lot of you
want to say it's over already blah blah
in some states it is and i get all that
china interestingly just locked down 13
million people in one of their bigger
cities
and uh it was because of a delta
outbreak
50 some people got got delta
they haven't detected omicron in the
country yet which i don't believe i mean
i don't believe it's not there but i do
believe it's not detected we're not
reported
but
don't doesn't china have a big problem
if they have delta with their own
omicron
because the weirdness of the um
let's say the effectiveness of which
their lockdowns work i mean they're
brutally cruel to the citizens but they
do seem to be effective apparently
um when you do the total lockdown not
the kind we do
so
what will happen if delta
starts sweeping through the major
countries
i don't know that the chinese healthcare
system could handle a real outbreak
i mean i had they had no choice but to
lock down the whole city when they found
it but i think that they're they may be
at the beginning of the pandemic
can somebody who's smarter than than i
am which is a lot of you
on anything involving pandemics and
viruses could you could you give me a
give me a reasonability check check on
this assumption
that china might be closer to the
beginning of the pandemic
because if they haven't had
anything but vaccinations and i don't
think their vaccinations are that hot
anyway
uh
isn't delta going to rip through there
now their only hope is that omicron gets
there first but
maybe it's delta
you know that's why they lock down the
city
um
did you let let me ask you this question
is your assumption
that in the united states we have over
counted covet deaths or undercounted
tell me in the comments what's your
assumption now of course it's hard to
know
uh let's see if we overcounted or under
counted i'm seeing nothing but overs
on locals
everybody here is saying
every one of you is saying over
some of you saying don't know over over
a way over a way over okay
turns out you're all wrong
maybe
here's the argument why it's vastly
undercounted
and i'm going to tell you the argument
and then you tell me if it doesn't sound
reasonable
now what do you think is the process for
counting deaths
like in in your imagination
how do you how do you imagine it happens
now the way i imagine it
is that somebody dies in the hospital
the doctors say okay those symptoms look
like cova we better run a test
or
it's it's obvious
say oh we even know where the covenant
came from you got it from your spouse
you have all the symptoms
you died
covet
and i think i think that's allowed as
well so you don't have to have a test
i think you can use your doctor judgment
to say this is obviously covered
right
now
here's the part i didn't know about
apparently a lot of people still die at
home
did you know that
i mean
you don't hear about it a lot but
there's still a lot of people who just
die at home now these are people who
might have been in sort of a hospice
situation at home
meaning that you knew they were going to
go pretty soon
but what happens when somebody dies at
home
doctor says uh hey what happened and the
family member says well grandma died
and then does the doctor say do you
think it was coveted
[Laughter]
no
because it's just it's just a family
member
they don't know if it's coveted if there
wasn't a test
so they just say i don't know
but she had a bad heart
so doctor writes down bad heart
so there was a
study done recently
that showed at least in one area where
they did the study
that the
that the number of cova deaths were
grossly undercounted
dr robert gaylord hospitals were totally
empty in 2020 scott wake up okay i'll
i'm gonna block you a for being stupid
because that comment is stupid and also
uh for saying wake up so you get blocked
for that height user on that channel
um
you you all realize that how empty the
hospitals were was because the hospitals
stopped taking regular business
that's why they were empty
had nothing to do with covet i mean
whether or not there was a covert
pandemic
all right so uh the report said that uh
when everybody's overworked that they
just don't do the same level of
effort
to have a cause on the death report so i
guess our our system for reporting cause
of death just broke down completely
now
my experience in the corporate world
suggests
under counting
right so as the creator of the dilbert
comic
who knows a little bit about
bureaucracy and how people act when
they're at work
to me these two competing stories one is
that
too many things were coded covet which
is possible certainly in some places
that may have happened
then the counter
the alternative explanation is that uh
because people were incompetent and
overworked and the system broke down
that they didn't report all the covet
which one of those seems more likely to
you based on your life experience
we don't we don't even have good facts
let's just say just life experience
my life experience tells me it's under
accounted
the the over counted kind of assumes
that everybody was sort of in on
something or they had a standard that
didn't make sense and everybody was
adhering to some weird standard
but i don't think there's evidence of
that
all right well looks like i'm going to
have a problem in a minute
all right
um
there's a robot that can cultivate a
desert
um i'm gonna have to take a break
there's something that i always do
that uh i'll be right back
hey you're still here
thanks for waiting
[Music]
all right so there's a robot that can
cultivate a desert so there's this
little robot that's autonomous it'll go
out and it'll search for little wet
spots and it'll plant a seed
so if you let the robots run around on
the edge of the desert long enough
they'll actually shrink the size of the
desert by planting stuff around the
edges until it grows in
so that's a real thing
there's a similar idea
that i've seen
tested
in which you just let livestock wander
around on the edge of the desert
so somewhere between you know where
there's vegetation and the edge of the
desert you just let the livestock wander
around
and they'll eat the vegetation they'll
wander into the desert part and they'll
take a poop
and then the poop becomes the fertilizer
from which something new grows so as
long as you've got livestock wandering
around the edges of a desert the desert
gets smaller so now we've got this robot
that can shrink a desert and we've got
we know the animal model
you can imagine you can imagine having a
robot
that grabs the manure
takes it to the desert
so you can have the robot searching for
not for water
but for a ghost
and if it finds some it's like oh this
is good grabs a little handful and goes
over to the desert and dumps it there
but between these two technologies
and some combination thereof
we could shrink the size of deserts
so what does that do to climate change
i think that's certainly a path out
right
to shrink the deserts now i'd also
hypothesize some time ago
that apparently one of the reasons that
we get hurricanes on the east coast of
the united states
is that there's a time of year
in which there's a temperature
differential
between the ocean and northern northern
africa
and northern africa is desert so that's
hot the ocean is cooler and the
difference causes the formation of
hurricanes now it only happens in one
time a year because that's when the
temperature differentials are just right
what happens if you shrink the desert in
northern africa
in theory
it should reduce
it should reduce the hurricane powers
and that's completely practical
this is a technology that
that's just right here we just have to
do it
now getting it done might be hard but
there's nothing technologically hard
about it at all
grow milkweed jeff says well i don't
know much about milkweed but
that sounds like something you've looked
into
all right so that's cool
how many of you saw the uh compilation
clip where the mainstream media is using
the term a viral blizzard
have you heard the term a viral blizzard
for what's coming this winter
viral blizzard and everybody's using it
at the same time it's a viral blizzard
uh
if you would like to know and so some
people ask me on twitter
a few people ask me uh does that look
like professional work
like is there some professional
persuader who came up with this viral
blizzard thing because it sounds a
little too good
here's my answer
watch
watch the series dopesick about purdue
pharma a real company
and in that movie
one of the characters explains a trick
that pharma uses and then they used it
and the trick is you invent a condition
so that people have a reason to
prescribe your drugs
and in the movie
because they had a drug oxycontin that
was good for pain
but it wore off too soon
sooner than they claimed it would last
so they invented a new category called
breakthrough pain
and they said oh no your if your patient
didn't get 12 hours of relief that's
because they're in that special category
they're in the breakthrough pain kind
now breakthrough pain isn't a thing
like it never existed as a concept but
as soon as purdue uh and it's all of his
money people and the experts they hired
to to say these words out loud
they they created the idea that there
was a thing called breakthrough pain
and that the only way to treat it was to
get twice as much oxycontin
now how did purdue know to do this trick
in the series they explain how they know
to do it because it's a common trick
apparently it's a well-known technique
so
omicron is coming
we've got trillions of dollars of money
on the line for
vaccinations should we become a country
that keeps getting vaccinated
but
if omicron rips through and gives us
natural immunity
that actually works against the other
variants
then a trillion dollars or more
will be left on the table for big pharma
trillions of dollars that they kind of
expected to make
would just go away
if omicron does the same thing as a
vaccination
or better
and so
at just the time they needed it
at exactly the time that big pharma
needed it this new
viral blizzard thing gets invented
do you think that's a coincidence
that that there's a name for it
no it is not a coincidence that there's
a name for it the viral bliss
i'm looking at a funny meme uh the viral
blizzard
is the reason for vaccinations it's like
let me explain it to you this way
if you didn't have a word for it or a
phrase viral blizzard and you just
described it here's what it would sound
like
well looks like infections will go up
but we've got this omicron going on so
deaths will probably be you know
reasonable and lower after the holidays
so it looks like uh you know we're in
pretty good shape
if you just described it
straight that's what it would sound like
but if you really need people to get
worried
about the weakest virus of all time
omicron
you you say it's a viral blizzard
oh it's not just
that a lot of people got it is so many
people got it that the hospitals could
be overwhelmed and you better get a
vaccination just to keep the hospitals
open and stuff like that
but do you see the trick
once you know that this is a common
pharma trick
to come up with a new phrase that looks
like a new kind of condition
that's how you sell more product
once you see it it's obvious
all right
elon musk
said in an interview with
the babylon bee guys
which by the way you should watch it's
really interesting watching them
just chat
so that just came out but he says that
you could have enough solar panels
to power the whole country
if they were in a hundred square mile
area
which is not very big considering the
whole united states so 100 square miles
will give you all the solar panels you
need you'd have batteries of course
to
to store it so that you're
live all the time
but in theory you could get there now of
course elon doesn't mention
uh environmental impact of all the
discarded and you know old solar panels
and stuff which is fairly major
but he did mention and i had never heard
this idea before but i love it
that if you just post solar panels in
the area around existing nuclear power
plants because people don't like to live
near nuclear power plants
those solar panels don't mind so you
could put just solar panels only where
there are nuclear power plants
and
according to him the solar panels around
the nuclear power plant would produce
more power than the power plant
now i'm assuming his math is good
because you know he's good at math
uh that's kind of a mind-bender isn't it
that we already have a place to put them
and we already have a grid to connect to
because the nuclear power plant is on
the grid
so we have the exact right place
to put
not only
nuclear waste because the best place to
store that is also
right around the power plant
because it's the same place people don't
want to live
so
that's that's pretty optimistic
that we've got these technologies
that could solve everything
well trump is back making news as he
likes to do so on january 6 the most
provocative date he could ever pick he's
going to have some kind of a press
conference and we don't know what's
coming
but it's going to be fun
i know it's going to be fun that's all i
know
good or bad it's going to be fun
so of course he picks the most
provocative day to do this
but he's doing his uh persuader thing
and here's what he said yesterday
he said the insurrection took place on
november 3rd meaning the election itself
of last year and announced that he will
hold a news conference on january 6.
so he's going to try to say that the
election itself was the insurrection
because he claims it was
rigged
and then he says and i i like this
trump says why isn't the house uh the
unselect committee
he's calling him the on select committee
of highly partisan political acts
investigating the cause of the january 6
protest
which was the rigged election he says
now that's a pretty good
approach isn't it persuasion-wise
saying that the insurrection did happen
but it was on it was on november 3rd
same thing he did with fake news because
fake news is something that was used
against him he flipped he flipped it
against the fake news
so it looks like he's trying to do a
flip on the insurrection
and then he's also saying why aren't you
investigating the cause of it of the
january 6
protest why not look into that
now
you know there's there are answers to
that question but as persuasion is
pretty good
and he says the only thing that they can
do is not talk about it
so here's the thing that i realized
so we live in a country
in which for the last five years and
give me a fact check on this
give me a fact check as i go
true or false we have learned that our
intelligence agencies cannot be trusted
true or false
true right
true or false we have found out that
democrats
cannot be trusted as
as evidenced by the russia collusion
hoax
did the russia collusion hoax not tell
you that democrats can't be trusted
they did
even leadership
right
so
uh now the democrats you would agree
would say the same thing about
republicans right
so i don't know what most of you are but
probably you're leaning right if you're
watching this
so both sides think the the other side
is not credible
so what about the news
is the news credible
no no any illusion you had about the
news being credible
is gone
right
how about uh the way we manage anything
from climate change to
the pandemic
you know did we manage the pandemic
flawlessly
so we have this weird situation
where literally every
institution in this country that we can
observe
is fraudulent and corrupt or incompetent
is that a fair statement
then the last five years we've learned
every
every
major institution
is either corrupt
incompetent or fraudulent
you know in substantial ways not in
minor ways but in very very substantial
ways
right
now
aren't we lucky
that the one exception
the one exception
to all of this incompetence and fraud
and corruption
the one exception
was that our election system
ran smoothly
without any of those problems
nothing i mean nothing to speak of you
know the minor things but but nothing
that would change the result
it's kind of phenomenal isn't it
you might even say
hard to believe
now do i have any evidence that the
election was rigged in a way that would
change the election result nope
nope
no evidence of that at all but isn't it
lucky
that every system in the united
states we guarantee
is fraudulent corrupt
and competent every one of them
but not the elections
not the elections
so we built a an election system which
by its design
can't be fully audited
intentionally
now when i say intentionally i mean that
whoever was involved in the design
had to know it couldn't be audited so
it's intentional in that sense
so the only thing that worked well is
the only thing we can't check
are you kidding me
and nobody's as far as i know there's
nobody in the government who's even
trying to
change it to make it more transparent
make it more auditable instantly
be able to track your vote
well
they're not yet they're not allowed to
reverse engineer the software that's
right so when you get into the software
component of it there's nothing to audit
you can't do it
or it would be too difficult or you know
there would be legal challenges you know
but whatever the obstacles are it can't
be audited we do know that
so
how dumb do we have to be
to believe that the election system is
the only thing that works fine
seriously
seriously
i mean you really have to be dumb to
believe that
now again i have no evidence that this
election was rigged it's entirely
possible that the mistakes went in the
other direction
you can't rule out that trump he might
have lost by even more votes if the
election had not been rigged i guess
so we don't know what is right and what
is wrong
but the moment you fool yourself into
thinking it's the last
 thing that worked
that is stupid
can i say that out loud
it's just stupid
to think it's the one thing that worked
just flawlessly and it's the one thing
we can't check right all the other
systems are a little hard to check also
but at least you can guarantee that you
know that the news is fake because you
can just look at the real video
you can see how they edited the video
you can say oh well that's fake news
right there
so
the only thing we can't verify is the
one that's working right
really
all right you want to know how to
get the election system fixed
uh i would recommend radical compliance
radical compliance have ever told you
this concept before instead of saying
it's bad you agree with it and embrace
it but you embrace it until you crush it
so every time you talk about the
election
you should say something like
well it's a great thing that's the only
system in this country that hasn't been
proven to be corrupt
and fraudulent
it's great that it's the only one
and
it's impossible to audit it
i want you to just say that to people
who think the election was fair
and just leave it there
yeah it's the only thing
we can't check
but we are told by the people who lied
to us about literally everything
according to the people who lied to us
about everything
these elections are good and fair
according to all the people we know are
liars
and that's all just true by the way i
don't think i exaggerated anything did i
i mean i make it sound like absolutes
but
candace owens glows compared to you
well i wasn't expecting that comment but
if your comment is that candace owens is
better at this than i am i would agree
with you
she's really good at this
all right
um
rasmussen had a poll and asked
whether people thought the 2020 election
was uh
had cheating that
affected the outcome
and 59
of combined you know voters
on both sides
said that cheating is somewhat or very
likely affected the 2020 election
59 percent of the public
thinks the 2020 election
was not necessarily
fair
59
that's up from 56 percent the last time
they they checked it
why is it moving in that direction
why why is the public opinion moving in
in the direction of trump's
opinion
what is causing that
somebody said regret biden regret
maybe
there could be people who simply didn't
care
and now that they see that biden's not
performing that well
maybe they care i don't know
that could be
payments somebody says all right here's
what i think
i think that as we observe every one of
our institutions being
fraudulent it is now impossible to
imagine that this is the one exception
that's what i think
i also think that as time goes by
the the uh
the impulse to just take sides and get
rid of trump no matter what
is being replaced by more
reasoned assessment
and nobody reasonable can't
assume we even know if it was a rigged
election there's no way to check
so let's see do the math here uh
15 59 said
percent said cheating is somewhat a very
likely effect of the election
uh let's see how many people uh
think that it's not at all likely
or they're unsure
26
26
26
almost exactly the number of people
who get every question wrong
all right
so we got two things going on
we've got therapeutics coming out for
covid
and we've got lots of uh testing coming
so that's all good news right
all that testing is coming and
therapeutics are coming
but at the moment
uh
right now you can't get a test because
there's not enough of them
and you also can't get the therapeutics
because there's not enough of them
but if you could get tested and found
out you had covet
you could get the therapeutic except
they don't exist
so sort of a good news
someday
at the moment
not so much
and there are more people saying that
omicron is the the vaccine
so
uh i feel like i got ahead of this one i
don't know if anybody said it before i
did
that as soon as i heard that omicron was
so weak i was like it's a vaccine
now now you're hearing actual doctors
say it
right before it was just idiot on the
internet me saying hey i think it's a
vaccine you know best case scenario but
now they're actually saying that best
case scenario it's it uh
gives us herd immunity all right now
here's the question
dog not barking
there's something missing
that's really really conspicuously
missing but not until i mention it
all right i'm going to mention something
that you're going to slap your forehead
and say
why are you the first person to say this
goes like this
apparently we were pretty good at
predicting the rate of growth of omicron
because we'd see another country's
growth so we could see how quickly it
would
take over the united states
so we're pretty good at predicting that
now we also know how many people have
vaccinations
and we probably could predict fairly
closely
how many people are likely to get
boosted and further vaccinated in the
next few months
if you had that information
how fast omicron is spreading
and how many people are vaccinated and
boosted and likely to get extra
shots
could you not calculate
the day of uh herd immunity
we now have everything we need
right
because it you know with the slow-moving
virus it would it's harder you know you
you say i don't know sometime this year
we hope maybe next year
but with this super super fast omicron
isn't there somebody smart enough to say
you know at this rate you're talking
five weeks and done
why has nobody even calculated that
because it is calculatable right
am i right
now february 1st i think would be maybe
after that date
but it certainly would give us enough
time to see what the
what the surge from the holidays look
like and we'd know a lot more
you know if we have to revise february
1st it can happen
but
um yeah we'll continue to mutate but
they tend to mutate toward less
less
dangerous
that's
you know that doesn't have to be the
case i guess
but they tend to
hospitals say another five to six weeks
until omicron burns through
now when they talk about omicron burning
through they're really talking about
a surge but we've had surges before
that don't lead to herd immunity
right we we've had lots of surges but we
didn't get hurt immunity but i feel like
with the omicron because of the speed of
its uh infection
the
well we don't know that south africa has
peaked out but the numbers suggest that
that's correct
that could be seasonal i don't know
could be anything else
so
it's isn't it conspicuously missing
am i wrong about that it should be the
most important number in your life
i mean in terms of the public life
because nothing would be more important
than knowing when omicron plus
vaccinations get us to
i don't know eighty percent
whatever herd immunity requires
it used to be we thought sixty seventy
percent was hurt immunity
but it feels like this one's gonna need
to be a lot higher you know i'm thinking
80 plus
right well
uh
all right
there is a co-defendant in the january 6
things somebody who is a self-described
member of the proud boys
and he's one of the first writers to
breach the capital and he's pleading
guilty
to conspiracy and other felony charges
now i don't think anybody
is uh defending anybody who did anything
that was a felony right so i'm not going
to say anything good about this
individual if he committed felonies
but
conspiracy
i wasn't i didn't even know that was a
crime did you
when did conspiracy become a crime has
it always been a crime
i mean i know a rico is if it's an
organized thing
but apparently if two or more people
talk about and plan a crime
that has the extra
problem of conspiracy
i feel like it shouldn't be illegal to
talk about stuff
that's a weird law it doesn't make sense
to me the crime of course
but planning a crime what happens if you
plan a crime and then don't do it
i think that's not conspiracy in that
case if you don't do the crime but i
don't know why the planning part is the
crime
isn't the crime the crime
i don't know i guess i just don't
understand the law and why that has to
be a crime but it made me ask this
question
if conspiracy is a crime
how is adam schiff not in jail
is that because there was nothing about
the
the russian
collusion hoax none of that was illegal
because if any of it was illegal
then conspiring to do it would be
illegal as well as i understand it
but
isn't isn't it obvious that adam schiff
conspired
as part of the uh
as part of the
hoax and how is it not
illegal to try to overthrow the
government with a hoax
isn't that what an insurrection is
can somebody google this does an
insurrection have to be
kinetic
can you have an insurrection that does
not involve violence
or is insurrection automatically
violence
give me
check that definition for me
uh
oh i thought i'd have it by now
sedition
insurrection usually means violence but
doesn't have to
any over act i think somebody just
looked it up any overt act
well wouldn't you say that adam schiff
was part of
the public would say an over act
of uh trying to overthrow a government
with a hoax
and it was a conspiracy as well because
i'm sure they coordinated and talked
about it are you telling me that if we
if we got a hold of adam schiff's
digital communication
you wouldn't find anything in there that
was conspiracy to overthrow the
government with a hoax
because i feel like
maybe it's in there
all right
um do you remember that i told you that
the golden age was coming a few years
ago
and you said to yourself
i don't think so we got a pandemic
instead of a golden age
everything's falling apart
now we did get
we did get indication that fusion
nuclear fusion is practical
and there are number of companies
building actual
test models i guess
and also we got good news that uh
nuclear power in general went from
behated to now accepted so you you know
you could say it's not a golden age
except for
you know there is one big part of it
that at least on the energy side
things seem to have turned in exactly
the right direction but that's about all
that
all that happened right we didn't get
any of the cool things we expected like
there's no flying cars
well actually there is a flying car
um it's being advertised now it's got
eight
it's sort of a helicoptery thing with
eight engines
so eight independent
rotors
three i think they have three
backup systems in case something goes
wrong it's got a it's got its own
parachute
so you can actually parachute out of it
i mean the device itself has a parachute
and uh had some other safety feature i
forget but apparently you can you don't
need a pilot's license you can just get
in this thing they're being manufactured
now they're still raising money but
they're making them
so all right so we did get fusion and
nuclear energy and we did and looks like
we do have flying cars
but it's kind of disappointing for a
golden age we would expect more that's
really all we got
well according to elon musk
we could also solve
climate change and all of our problems
with a
100 square miles of solar panels
so i guess now we have two ways to solve
climate change
so i well okay so we solve climate
change and energy for the future
but that's kind of all we did
it's not very impressive for a golden
age
well we did put a rocket into space uh
that landed elon musk's rocket and we
have opened up an age of space travel
and mars colonization
some people may say that was sort of a
golden ag but i mean that's not much
with
fusion and nuclear energy and flying
cars and
solar panels fixing climate change and
going to mars
so not that important we did um because
the pandemic completely rearranged
how we work and where
so that more people are working home and
not dying
commuting every day so that's a gigantic
thing but
yeah i mean it's just one thing we did
seem to get rid of antifa
blm riots they all seemed to go away
we did seem to wake up to the fact that
our news is fake
which seems important
and we may have figured out a way to be
safe from all future pandemics
um
and the robots are going to be uh
seeding the desert so we may have ended
hurricanes
i think we're at the golden age
i think it's here
we've never had things go this well
before
even with the pandemic
you know which is a giant pain in the
ass
uh this is the best we've ever been
by far
by far
now of course
thank you
richard
i appreciate that
um
yes and uh if you hadn't noticed uh elon
musk is also building a satellite
network
which will probably
free people from censorship someday
i think that's the real play i mean it
has lots of obvious uses but i feel like
elon musk owning
a complete end-to-end
star link is called a complete
end-to-end communication
essentially an internet
i feel as though that's good news
and china's uh impact is decreasing
we're going to bring our manufacturing
home slowly but we'll do it
and uh
something tells me
that uh
we're in the golden age
and
i hate to be all
you know optimistic and stuff
but
i don't think we've ever been healthier
by the way one of the things that elon
musk said it was just sort of a
just sort of a comment he tossed in
there when he was talking to the
the uh
folks on uh i don't know funhouse mirror
neurons
i don't know what that means eric
um he was talking about uh
the
neural link technology they'll put a
little chip in your skull
so drill down a little bit put a chip in
there of some sort of sensor or chip or
something
and it can interact with your brain
directly
and when elon was talking about
the future of meta and facebook and he
was sort of making fun of it you know
elan was saying you know it's like
putting a television set on your nose
basically
he doesn't see that as being the thing
but then somebody asked will we be able
to
directly see virtual reality someday
with a neural link implant
and no glasses
do you know what elon musk said
will you someday be able to enter a
virtual world
just by wanting to
he said yes
[Laughter]
he didn't say yes maybe
he didn't say i don't know you know
that'd be really hard to do
he just said yes
when was the last time he was wrong
about you know the future
i i think he's pretty good at predicting
these things
so we actually are entering a period
where you'll be able to get a chip in
your head
your skull
that you will be able to enter virtual
reality and interact with anybody all
over the world
just by thinking it
and that's happening you know i mean
we're on the path to that i don't know
how long that'll take i mean that feels
like a a 25-year plan not a five-year
plan
but we're on the way
we're on the way
uh glasses will be first yeah probably
but the glas
as elon pointed out the all of the
solutions with glasses cause
motion sickness
if you haven't tried virtual reality and
i recommend it highly it's quite a hoot
um it gives me motion sickness and i
don't even get motion sickness
so i've never had motion sickness from
any real world you know ride or car or
anything like that not even little
but uh
if you wear the virtual reality goggles
for half an hour
you you'll be sick all day
you'll actually be sick for hours
you're like oh
and if they haven't if they don't figure
out a way to fix that
uh i'm not sure if they're close to if
they can't fix that then
there's definitely a limit to the growth
and e-bikes somebody's mentioning
e-bikes here e-bikes are changing
everything
like i i can't tell you enough about how
that's going to change things in
california it's the only bike anybody
buys now is an e-bike i'm exaggerating
but most of the bike sales are e-bikes
now
david says i wear them for hours at a
time and no motion sickness it's
individual and i and i think you might
be able to get used to it i'm not sure
if that's the thing but
yeah biden said no one saw omicron
coming that was just a bidenism
you know
that's the sort of thing that you could
imagine
trump would have said in some fashion
right i don't get worked up about the
little
that little stuff
um
e-bike are trash compared to mopeds yeah
they are mopeds though i mean some of
them are just basically mopeds that you
can pedal
uh vr sickness is like sea legs you get
used to it could be
could be i mean that makes sense that
you would
uh military pilot training
it was rare that people didn't get sick
during training right
you can figure it out most did something
in other words you can figure out how
not to get sick i guess
um
yeah i can confirm
isn't mail-in voting basically rigging
well
i mean no
mail-in voting is not basically rigging
but it opens an opportunity for a
mischief so
so yes i think we all agree on that we
just don't know
how much of it there will be and by the
way if the republicans are not looking
to do as much mischief
on their
end don't know why they wouldn't because
apparently it's all legal
um
the tackle unique qr code
eric says
we're finally waking up
um yet
tiny houses are not the thing
okay this was my show for today
i think it was incredible possibly the
best thing you've ever experienced
and tomorrow might be even better so you
don't want to miss that
so um
as we approach the end of the year
i plan to do some you know best and
worst of the year stuff and
thanking some people who
you know were especially
effective this year i think that needs
to be done
and uh
we're going to run out of news pretty
soon
you all know that right yeah as soon as
uh as soon as the kids come home and
we're on holiday
over here the news just stops
um
scott can we oh here's an interesting
question can we use the mass formation
psychosis concept
as a trojan horse to get more people to
accept the older more polarizing concept
of fake news don't need to
i think the democrats see fake news now
the kyle ridden house thing i think
opened a lot of eyes
will christina do christmas music she
was planning to
um
but our
uh house
redoing here
it's hard to practice because there's so
much noise in the house
so i don't know if she's where she wants
to be on that
can we get more micro lessons you will
probably probably more of them over the
holidays the the thing that's holding me
up in the micro lessons is the noise in
the house
so as soon as there's no buzz saws going
on i can do more of them
um
all right
that's all for now and i will talk to
you all tomorrow
