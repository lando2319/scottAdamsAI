well i'm happy to announce that the air

i could walk outside for short periods
yeah
yeah for a little while the weather
teased us

outside
i could leave my house safely not so

but i'm looking forward to tomorrow
maybe tomorrow will be better
so how's everybody feeling about
the country how are you feeling about
politics how are you feeling about your
personal situation how about that
coronavirus
how you feeling about that what about
those poles
what about all the the drama how you
feeling about all this
does it feel as though everything's
going wrong and there's just
it seems almost helpless helpless and
hopeless
well that my friends is the third act
yeah you are right in the middle of the
third act
the way it's supposed to look is like
there's no way out
if it looks to you like oh my goodness
there are lots of ways this could go but
none of them look especially good
you're in the third act how will it turn
out
well we don't know yet do we that's what
makes it the third act
if you could see exactly how this will
be resolved
in a good way it wouldn't be the third
act
it's the it's the unknown that makes it
special
and let's talk about all of those things
but i will tell you that i remain
optimistic
that's not to say that people won't die
from the coronavirus and that will be
tragic
it's not to say that there won't be more
violence in the streets
i'm sure there will be and it's not to
say
that we won't have all kinds of
surprises and shocks and
and punches in the stomach but you know
what
we're ready we're ready for all of that
we are so ready this country and
indeed the world we will get through
this
and we will get through it better
we'll be we'll be smarter we'll be
stronger
those of us who make it through which
will be most of us
uh one one of the most fun stories
that's happening
is the conway family so kellyanne conway
has taken
time off from her professional life to
be with the family
and of course you know her husband
george conway is the president's
one of his biggest critics and i guess
he stepped back from being a critic for
a while too
and they've got a 15 year old daughter
of claudia
who is absolutely hilarious
i i i feel bad
for uh kellyanne and for george they
have to
deal with a teenage daughter but uh
there's something about the whole story
that's so it's so completely human
and relatable that it's just sort of
perfect
if you haven't seen the latest video
that 15 year old
claudia posted that her mother did not
appreciate
he had to check it out you know to hear
kellyanne swearing at her and then
finding out that she's being recorded
next thing you know it's post it's
posted on social media
um i i just i would just say i have uh
good feelings
about both the daughter and mother and
and that and i have some empathy for
george as well
uh just that they're going through it
none of it's terribly important
you know it doesn't affect you doesn't
affect me
and i suppose it's a little bit
embarrassing for them
but wouldn't you watch that uh reality
show
if the conways turned their their
situation into a reality tv show
i'd watch i know i'd watch
so anyway i'm just wishing them well um
so joe biden had his little town hall
last night
and how many lies do you think he told
at his town hall
a lot you know joel pollock uh
you know put him together and uh
published them
so it was all the the you know his
biggest hits
all of his normal lies but he is still
in in big events he's still telling the
the charlottesville
fine people lie now just think about
that
think about the fact that for two years
it has been
massively debunked i mean it's probably
probably the debunking has been
published more times than just about
anything else in the last two years and
still
the the news silos are so tight
that that that message doesn't penetrate
the left
i would say if i had to guess
i would say 90 percent of the people who
watch cnn
primarily have no idea that anybody even
has tried to debunk the charlottesville
fine people hoax
they wouldn't even be aware that there's
another point of view
and it's not even a point of view it's
just a fact check didn't happen
you know read the transcript it's
obvious it didn't happen so his primary
um really the thing that he bases his
entire campaign on
objectively easy to confirm
didn't happen just never happened it's
literally just something we made up
well other people made it up as well but
here's the amazing thing
if you ask people what's the main reason
that they don't like
president trump the number one reason
would be they'd say he doesn't tell the
truth
that would be it that would be the
number one reason and the guy running
against him
can tell a whopper of a lie like the
biggest lie of the last 10 years
and can completely get away with it
now i'm just
it's just sort of amazing that we're at
a point where there's
just no importance to facts
you know the the fact that this didn't
happen has
nothing to do with the fact that it will
change the election
it doesn't matter yeah he always tells
this bulging vane story
let me tell you how i would love to see
the third act
get resolved i'd like to see
trump and by the way i don't think this
will happen so this is not a
this is not a prediction and it's also
not one of those annoying
recommendations for what the president
should say
do you read these article opinion pieces
where
where people will presume to say here's
what the president should say
he should he should issue a statement
that says this and then they'll write it
as if it's in his voice
all of that stuff just is so cringy to
me
and i'll tell you why none of the people
who would like to put words into trump's
mouth
could have done what he did which is
become president
by saying the things he said instead of
the things they think he should have
said
at what point do we say all right can we
accept that it's not a coincidence
that he says things we wouldn't say does
things we wouldn't do
but it made him president so
shouldn't you at least question your own
judgment and say all right
all right maybe i'm not so smart
maybe i actually can't tell what is the
right thing to do
maybe it's just the thing i would like
to hear but it wouldn't necessarily work
politically you can't doubt
the president's instincts at this point
his instincts to
connect with the you know the the people
as opposed to the pundits
so um
here's here's one of the things that
bugs me like crazy is that there's a lot
of magical thinking going on
when people criticize the president and
the magical thinking
goes like this that our other presidents
were of good moral character and this
one is not
and therefore that's a problem when you
say that that capture is pretty much
the entire democrat problem with
president trump
he's got a flawed moral character they
would say
and therefore having a president with a
flawed moral character
is going to get you a bad outcome right
that's their argument but here's the
problem
remind me which of our presidents had
good moral
good moral fiber you got your presidents
that you think had good moral fiber but
you don't know as much about them as
perhaps i do
they do know some things that are just
not public
um what about nixon what about
bill clinton what about obama
everything he did was honest never told
a lie
never did anything a little fishy what
about obama
possibly being behind overthrowing the
next administration and spying on the
trump campaign
these are pretty big moral failings
pretty big
what about the founders literally slave
owners
great moral character not by today's
standards
i'm i'm not even sure it was by the
standards of their own time it wasn't
even great moral character necessarily
don't know how they thought of it but i
don't think everybody thought it was
great moral character
so i would say that it's magical
thinking to imagine
that the better your moral character
according to
outside observers the better your
uh result as a president i would say
that there's
absolutely no correlation
in evidence at all and yet it's the
number one thing
that the president's critics obsess on
and and their alternative doesn't
provide it biden provides
nothing of the sort if what you want is
to get the president with good moral
character
he just doesn't offer that not even
close he's not even in the
general zip code of good moral character
is he a nice guy apparently i guess
people like him
in person he's not very abrasive that
counts a lot right
that we live in a world where people
appreciate that
but does he lie like crazy does he have
some
potential you know ukraine issues
yeah was he maybe a little too involved
in with obama
in spying on the trump campaign probably
has he ever told gigantic lies that are
the type that would tear the country
apart
yes the fine people oaks so
it's a deep magical thinking that biden
has good moral quality
or that you need it that it's somehow
important
it's a it's a variable that matters and
you may have noticed that uh
oh here's something interesting uh in
2016
i was sort of a novelty as a pundit
on politics because i wasn't known for
talking about this stuff
and i got invited on a lot of
left-leaning platforms
now some of it was because i was
promoting a book so it's easier to
get invited to places if you have a book
but i was on i was invited on
morning joe i've been on cnn
several times in the past um
i've been on you know sam harris had
beyond to
i'm not sure what you would call him
politically but he had beyond
i was on um bill maher's show real time
how many of those shows left-leaning
platforms
have invited me on uh this time
now keep in mind that the reason they
invited me on is that i was a weird
i was an oddity and i was i was saying
that trump would win the election
so that made me like a weird crazy guy
right
because i was predicting the
unpredictable but it turns out i was
right
and not only was i right but i turned
out to be right about some other big
stuff including
kamala harris getting as close as she
has to the
to the top of the ticket and you would
think
that if you started down unusual and you
showed that you were right
you would be invited to all of those
places that had you on before
because i would say that they did fine
in terms of clicks and they did fine in
terms of audience
i don't think they lost any audience by
having me on probably gained a little
so what do you what do you make of the
fact
that i am completely shut out from the
entire left
silo means they're afraid of me
now it could be because i'm not
interesting that's the other possibility
but to compare these two
these two explanations for why i'm shut
down of that whole world
one is that i suddenly became less
interesting
even though all of my traffic is higher
than it's ever been before
so if you were to look at every
objective measure
of whether i'm interesting it's through
the roof
you know all of my numbers are way up
compared to what they were
the other alternative is that i'm
dangerous in other words i have a point
of view
which would penetrate the silo i think
that they know which people they can
bring over
and will be discounted by their audience
you know
there are lots of strong voices that if
you bring them over
they they're going to say stuff
that are pro-trump but they won't they
won't land
they just won't penetrate that you know
that audience
but if you get somebody who can
penetrate the audience
they get blackballed look at steve
cortez
steve cortez used to be on contract for
uh
cnn but i think it was when he when he
debunked the fine people hoax
was probably the last time they invited
him on even though he was still on
contract
and then i guess the contract probably
ran out so
anybody who can who can break through
they immediately
get them out of there because that's
going to ruin the ruin the whole
the whole deal how about the polls do
you believe the polls that are coming
out that are showing
trump is way way behind and falling even
deeper behind
well you probably saw the stories that
the democrats are being over sampled
in these polls so it looks like there's
a big change but maybe there's not
however however what if there is
what if it turns out there is a big
change
in trump's support let's say it dropped
you know just dropped a lot because of
the
hospital stay the coronavirus situation
what if it dropped do you think that
would be real
i do i think it would be real but
not real in the way that normally polls
are real
normally polls are real in the sense
that they might predict the future
i think these might be real as in there
might be a real drop
off people being unhappy about the the
way the president handled his own
infection
and others if they're unhappy about that
i think people vote in the polls
in other words they show their
displeasure by expressing it to a
pollster
but when it comes to election day and
they've got a pick
oh okay now i'm not just expressing my
displeasure
now it's real so i think that people
who might end up voting for the
president
could be expressing their displeasure
about whatever's happening this week
by giving him you know a bad poll result
and say yeah i'm just going to invite
vote for biden or i'm not going to vote
or i'm going to vote for kanye or
something
i don't feel as if when people
turn against the president on a specific
issue
it feels more like they're trying to
guide him because you know he looks at
the polls right
we all know that he would be absolutely
influenced
by any strong poll movement we know that
so i think people are not just telling
you what they want i think they're
trying to influence the president
and if you see a big move based on a
single topic
it might be people just sending him a
message you know what i mean
and that might not reflect the final
vote
so let us go over what he did right or
wrong
uh and it's an interesting one this time
and i guess i'll save my summary for
whether i think it's mostly right or
mostly wrong
but here's what he said so the president
as you know left
um walter reed earlier than most people
would think he should
all right so the first thing you need to
know is that he wanted the president
obviously wanted to manage the situation
so he would look
a little bit superhuman did he
accomplish that
i think so i think so i think he
accomplished
making it look like his stamina his
power
his health his vitality was more than a
match for the coronavirus
so would it have been medically
advisable to stay a little bit longer
perhaps
i'm no doctor what do i know maybe um
but was it a good move on the
president's part to be aggressive
on getting out there i'm going to say
probably yes
i think the net of that is slightly
positive if not
more than slightly i think that people
need to see their leaders acting strong
even when we know they're acting and
that's important
when i see the president um you know
acting like he's all healthy and you
probably saw there's some video of him
breathing hard
when he got back to the white house
climbed some stairs
he was noticeably struggling to breathe
and you could tell that he was trying to
not look like he was
struggling to breathe in other words it
was obvious to anybody
that he was putting on an act to look
healthier than he
might have actually been are you
bothered by that
are you bothered by knowing he's
putting on a you know an act
probably not you're probably not
bothered by that because that's part of
the job
part of the job of a leader is to look
like a leader
are you bothered by the fact that he
wears a suit and tie
when he's in the oval office well you
should be he's putting on an
act right he's not naturally born in a
suit and tie
he's acting like a president by dressing
like one
when he's in the oval office so he's a
big phony right because he wears a suit
in the oval office no no we accept
that a president needs to put on a show
it's a show you might not want to call
it a show
but it's a show and it's it's important
that he does the show right
it's part of part of being a good leader
so i would say that
his his instinct to show strength
is correct you'll get a lot of pushback
from it
but i think that was a correct instinct
he didn't get everything right though so
it's not going to be all compliments in
case you're wondering
uh here are some things he said uh in a
video he said don't let it dominate you
meaning coronavirus
don't be afraid of it you're going to
beat it
he said he feels better than he did 20
years ago and don't let it take over
your lives
and then he said and i'm paraphrasing a
little bit but he says as your leader
i had to do that i led
and then i know there's a risk so he was
saying that he had to be a leader
and basically do the same thing that he
was asking of the public
which is to go about your business take
a chance
jake tapper interpreted that as
he insanely is saying that he
intentionally got the virus to be a good
leader
is that exactly what he said is that a
fair
fair characterization did the president
say he intentionally got the virus
because it would make him a better
leader no
no that's not exactly what happened but
will people see it that way or hear it
that way they might
they might so let's look at his specific
statements about don't let it dominate
you don't be afraid of it
etc here's
here's the problem
if you thought he was going to come down
to the hospital
if you thought he was going to come out
of the hospital with humility
as in wow now that i've had coronavirus
i'm a changed person
well you probably haven't met trump
there wasn't much chance he was going to
come out of the hospital a changed
person i forget which pundit it was
i was listening to who was just laughing
at the notion that he would come out as
a different person
because it is sort of funny when you
think about it he's not really going to
be a different person
and we should assume that beating
coronavirus will make him
more trump and not less trump
all right so how do you feel about the
fact he's telling people not to be
afraid
of it etc well
i'm not sure he's nailing the messaging
so i would not give him an a
plus on the messaging there i do think
that people could take it the wrong way
as if he's not taking it seriously
enough
so i think that he may have exacerbated
the
you know the number of people who say
he's not taking it seriously will have
even more to yell about
than they had before so that part's not
good
but here's the part that's imponderable
and really here's the part that matters
is the president matching the public
now the president is definitely not
matching
the messaging that the experts would
want to use most of the experts
they would not want him to say what he's
saying
most of the pundits you know the people
who really pay attention to the news
most of them would also say i don't like
the way he did that
he is underplaying it etc but if you
added together
all of the experts and all of the
pundits
it would be this little sliver of the
total population
tiny tiny tiny sliver of the population
do they matter well they matter in terms
of influencing other people's opinions
but what about the public in general
is the public in general and let's say
republicans in particular
are they closer to trump's point of view
or are they closer to the pundits point
of view
i don't know exactly but my sense of it
is my instinct
is that the public is right there with
him
do you get that sense now because it's
the public
that never means all of the public right
there's always that big
solid block of democrats will hate him
no matter what he does so they'll be
against them no matter what
but in general when you say that
republicans are more
pro take the risk get back to work
and and might even appreciate the fact
that he modeled that behavior
i've got a feeling that there are far
more people
who are a little bit silent who are on
his side
about being a little more aggressive and
going back to work
and opening things up i just don't know
you're seeing that point of view
and here's why you don't see that point
of view
because in order to be honest about it
you would have to say the following
this would be an honest opinion and it's
why you don't see it
it's just too honest and it would go
like this i think it's more important
for young people to you know
to live their life and avoid you know
whatever
mental health and you know stunted uh
educational problems they'll have i
think that's more important
and keeping the economy strong is more
important those two things
the the health of the young the mental
health of everybody
but also opening the economy and keeping
that strong is more important
than the lives of elderly americans
if you can't say that
you can't be honest at least in that
point of view you can't be honest
now if there's somebody who says oh you
got to just protect
protect the old people well they're
being liars
because one of the ways you protect them
is by keeping the economy strong
how do old people get paid their social
social security
how are they protected how do they get
health care if the economy falls apart
they don't right old people would be
very vulnerable
to a collapsing economy maybe the maybe
the most vulnerable
and if you if you can't say it as
clearly
as i can say it and i'm going to say
this this is actually my actual opinion
now okay
so this is not an example opinion my
actual honest opinion
tell me how many people will be willing
to say this in public
it is my honest opinion that we should
set as a priority
the youth and the economy of the country
and and we should place those as higher
priority
than the lives the actual life life and
death
of senior citizens that's an honest
opinion now you could certainly disagree
with that
but if you're disagreeing remember you
just agree you're disagreeing about
extent and maybe timing because
everybody understands you need a strong
economy
or else you're in big trouble so we we
know we need to do both right there's
nobody who's so dumb
that we only need to look at health or
we only need to look at the economy we
know it's a
you know we're going to be tweaking
those variables the whole time
but i'm just going to say a straight out
how in the world
do we ever get back to work until you
can say what i j
what i can say now i'm in you know i
have
fu money so i can say things in public
that other people can't
but i'm just going to say a straight out
i value youth
you know their lives and the economy
which supports us all including senior
citizens
i value those higher than i value the
life
the actual lives because people are
going to die in big numbers
of senior citizens now i've got a little
bit of credibility saying that
because i am a senior citizen right so
i'm 63
and i've got asthma so i'm at risk
very much at risk so when i say that i
value the lives of the young and the
economy
over you know the older people i'm
saying i value them over
myself and i'm saying it clearly
i value them over myself
indeed if you gave me a choice and said
here's the deal
tough choice scott the only way
young people are going to do well is if
sorry but you have to die we don't have
a second way to do this
it's just the only way to do it are you
are you up for that
i wouldn't like it wouldn't be very
happy about that choice
but i know what i choose i i've had a
good run
and i would make that choice so and i
think most people would actually
especially you know if you're over 80
i think if you did a poll of people over
80 and he said here's the deal
you've got a 15 chance of going a little
bit earlier
and it might not be pleasant but you
know any way you die isn't going to be
fun
so what do you do i think 80 year olds
would be on the same page
so my my take on trump
is that the pundits will rip them apart
the experts will
rip them apart and they'll all do that
thing where they don't have to talk
about trade-offs
they'll just talk about health as if the
economy isn't even part of the question
so i feel like the president's in better
shape
than the pundits realize because i think
he's just way closer
to the public on this uh that's my take
so here are the things which he he
perhaps did not do uh in a spectacular
way
so these have some trade-offs so just so
i'm being fair
because i know the the biggest criticism
i get which is completely
inaccurate is that i only say good
things about trump
so if you're one of those people who
thinks i only say good things about
trump
stay tuned you'll like this part
all right so here's some things that
are now so good certainly by downplaying
the virus
even though there's a reason for it and
i understand the reason
it could cause people to wear fewer
masks
and maybe that makes a difference do i
know that masks make a difference
i do not but i also don't know that they
don't make a difference
so given so many experts being pretty
sure that they do make a difference
the risk management suggests that you
should
go ahead and wear them because they
might
and it's such high high stakes you
should
do it if it might work so i think
downplaying the virus has a downside has
an upside as well
if we get back to work and we're not
afraid but definitely has a downside
he did go out again and say that the
coronavirus he was comparing it
to regular flu again
is it good for the president to compare
coronavirus to regular flu
it is terrible it's terrible
probably one of the worst things you
could do
because it's the one thing that
guarantees all of the experts and all
the pundits will
climb on top of you and there's just no
reason for it
he doesn't need to compare it to the
regular flu
to make his case that we should still
go back to work you just don't need that
comparison
and it works against his credibility now
the other thing if you haven't heard
this before
the the numbers of deaths from the
regular flu
are complete as far as i can
tell
have you ever met or heard of or know of
anyone who ever died of the regular flu
maybe some of you do i don't
i've been around for decades and i've
never heard of anybody
dying of a regular flu if it were
anywhere near
50 000 deaths a year you would know
somebody i mean 50 000 deaths a year
would be about the
number of automobile accidents right
somewhere in that range automobile
excellence do you know anybody
personally who died in an automobile
accident
yeah you do you do you probably know
several people who have died in
automobile accidents
how about guns gun deaths there's
there's somewhere in the neighborhood of
automobile accidents it's
somewhere in the low tens of thousands a
year right
do you know anybody who ever got killed
by a gun yeah you do probably
i know one two three i know several
people were killed by guns
but i don't know anybody who died from
the flu the regular flu
and um i tweeted this morning an article
maybe you've seen before
in which a doctor explains that we don't
count
regular flu deaths let me say that again
we don't count them so when somebody
says there were 50
000 flu deaths where's that number come
from
well not from counting i don't know
where it comes from
but it doesn't come from anybody
counting anything apparently
they get lumped in with pneumonia deaths
and it's some kind of an estimate
based on excess deaths or something but
there doesn't seem to be
backing for that and in fact the real
number of flu deaths
might be 10 of what's reported
all right so every time the president
compares
coronavirus to seasonal flu he looks
uninformed
even though his point about don't be so
afraid go back to work
that might still be the right thing to
do leadership wise
i just wouldn't use this comparison
because
it's just asking for trouble what about
him driving around and putting his
secret service
at risk by having them in the car with
him as he drove around to wave to
supporters
on the plus side i think it was valuable
because it does show that the leader is
alive he's still making decisions
he can still be mobile if he has to be
but he did put
the secret service at a little bit of
risk
probably not a lot a little bit but how
do you feel about it
you don't feel good about it do you i
would say that was
that would be a mistake i would say
there was something to gain
and he gained it which is he showed the
world he's alive
but there was also something to lose
because it looked a little selfish
so i think i think that was a net
negative it wasn't
it wasn't a complete negative because
there was something gained and it was
real
and is what he wanted to gain
but i'm going to judge that one a slight
negative
all right then what about the question
of going home too
soon or is it too soon
i would say that's a slight negative
again
because people are going to criticize
them for going home too soon they might
criticize them
for exposing more people by going back
too soon
but we assume that they'll have at least
good measures to keep them socially
distanced
but that part is also a trade-off
i would say that going home too soon
he could have waited another day could
have waited another two days would have
been fine
i think but making it look like he's
superman and going home
soon probably a little more
benefit than cost so i'm going to say
again
there was an unknown benefit he was
going for i think he got it
it makes it look sort of like he's
strong and vital
but there's a cost because it looked
like it might have been a little uh
bad judgment to go back that soon
i'd say slight slight positive there but
not a lot
um what about his uh
all of his tweets in all caps the the
day
i think it was the day he went back and
he started in the morning with all the
tweets and all caps not good
not good if you add up the all caps
tweeting
and the fact that he said he feels
better than he did
20 years ago um that sort of
strongly suggests that the
the steroid type drug that he's on might
have an influence on his personality
now i told you from my experience from
prednisone that it completely changes
your personality
you you become very aggressive
and you think you can conquer the world
and you do feel 20 years younger
indeed you might remember that i i
explained it
exactly in the same terms i said that on
prednisone you actually just feel like a
young person
it just completely turns you into a you
know in
in my case i felt 25. you know i could
do any exercise i could run all day
without getting sore
i could do anything it was like a super
drug now
i worry that when you take somebody with
trump's personality
and you put them on a super drug that
makes you feel
stronger and more confident and more
aggressive
than you would have felt normally that's
not a good situation
and i would go so far as to say i'm not
a doctor
so obviously this would be a doctor
decision not a
not a scot watching from thousands of
miles away decision
but i would like an answer on whether he
should be
25th amendmented and pence should be in
charge while he's on that drug
so let me say that again because you're
not going to like it so i want to make
sure that when i say something you don't
like i say it really clearly
um he's showing some indications
the all caps tweeting being a real tell
with the 20 years younger with the going
home a little early
you know being a little aggressive on
that stuff and then just the way he's
talking about beating the virus and
don't be afraid of it if you put them
all together
and again i'm not a doctor i'm just a
citizen
who doesn't want the country to blow up
in a nuclear fireball
that's all that's where i'm coming from
i i think the question has to be asked
the question has to be asked
if he should be taken off the field
until he's off that drug and i'd like to
i'd like to hear his doctor say
no there's no there's no changing his
personality from that drug
that might be the case i'd like to hear
the doctor say
no no no at the at the levels we gave it
to him
you don't even have to worry about side
effects it's because we gave him so
little i don't know if that's the case
i'm just saying that if the doctor told
me that i'd say okay
i'm still seeing these signs but you're
the doctor
you know i'd be willing to go with a
professional opinion who was close to it
but without that without the doctor
saying okay i hear what you're saying
i hear what you're saying about his
personality change and that would match
the side effects
that are known with this drug so maybe
we just
you know give the nuclear codes to pence
for a week
you know just maybe that one thing
at the very least i would like to speak
directly to whoever is in the nuclear
chain of command
if you get if you get a nuclear command
from president trump this week
maybe get a second opinion that's all
i'm saying
if the word comes down to launch the
nuclear arsenal this week
first thing you should do is call pence
the first thing you should do is not
launch first thing call mike pence
get a second opinion that's what i do
and i'm completely serious about this by
the way and it's based on my own recent
experience with prednisone it's a
different drug
but i think some similarities um
reporters are mad because i guess the
white house put them at risk
and also there there are reports that
the white house
in general the staff was not taking
seriously the social distancing
did not take seriously the mask wearing
and got exactly
the predicted outcome a bunch of
infections
which would also have an effect on the
reporters do you think the reporters are
happy
the ones that cover the white house not
so happy
not so happy at all
somebody's arguing with me in the com in
the comments all caps
doesn't equal aggression no any one of
those
signs the all caps you know the acting
strong likable you know feeling better
than 20 years ago
all of those things individually are not
alarming
you know if you saw any one of them you
say whatever
it's just the collection of them
combined with the fact that he's on a
drug that would cause you to act exactly
like
that so
you just asked the question has to be
asked
here now here's the other question do
you think that a president
should always give you the truth do you
think that it's the job of the president
to always give you the accurate
story about anything i would argue
no it is not the president's job to give
you the truth
and indeed if a president only ever gave
you the truth
you would want to get rid of that
president pretty quickly let me give you
some examples
should the president tell you what all
of their options are for
military responses no of course not
you don't want the president telling the
adversaries what our
military options are or what we're
thinking about that
or what we know about their military
plans so
when it comes to military stuff you do
want the president to lie to the public
because it's important what about
the economy do you want the president to
tell you
precisely exactly the truth about the
economy
or would you like maybe let's call it an
enhanced version of the truth
let's say a little extra on top of the
truth which would be better
what would be better is the extra
telling
talking about the economy in dry
accurate terms
is not good for the economy because as
i've told you many times the economy is
a
is a psychology machine if you get the
psychology right
then people feel optimistic and they
have confidence
they invest they buy and that's what
drives the economy
so if you don't give the economy
confidence it doesn't operate right
so should the president give you an
exact description of the economy with no
hyperbole or should the president
be largely true but give you a little
extra
so that you say to yourself whoa that's
a little better than i thought it was
i'd better invest oh that sounds pretty
good i think i'll spend a little extra
because i think things are going to go
well the answer is your president should
lie to you
it doesn't matter who the president is
they should lie to you
a little bit maybe a maybe a 20
lie would be about right you should talk
up the economy
you should say it's better than it is
you should say it's going in the right
direction even if it's not quite
the optimism that the president puts on
the economy is one of his strongest
one of his strongest qualities as a
president now what about
coronavirus is coronavirus and
because this is health should the
president give you an exact
you know really accurate dry
no hyperbole no exaggeration
nothing left out any any bad news
included
should he give you the most accurate
news he could give you
about the coronavirus well a lot of
people say yes
a lot of people say let us decide let
the citizens decide we'll decide
how afraid we are we'll decide what to
do with it
just be accurate just give us the
accurate information
that's that's a reasonable opinion i'd
say
and here's a better reasonable opinion
in my opinion
that he should talk it up a little bit
in other words he should try to
if if we know that the goal is to open
up
because the alternative is worse so the
alternative is staying closed
that's just worse we have two bad
options
one is really bad one is not quite as
bad we hope
opening up but they both have lots of
risks
under those conditions what do you want
your leader to tell the country
if you know that what's good for the
country is they take on some risk
what is the best way to treat that
probably something pretty close to the
way he's doing it
which is he's underplaying the risk
because he wants you to go back to work
now
is anybody unaware is there any citizen
of the united states
who doesn't know they could die from the
coronavirus
nope there's not one person in the
united states not a single person
who doesn't understand that they
personally
could die from the coronavirus they also
know
that experts have these recommendations
about what to do and what not to do
people are pretty well informed so when
the president gives you a little dose of
let's say
20 extra enhanced
uh let's say messaging because i don't
want to say that it's wrong or it's a
lie
because it's not that it's not the
president's job to give you accuracy
it's the president's job to lead and
sometimes the leader
needs to paint a picture of where you're
heading and it's a little bit rosier
than maybe accuracy would suggest if you
had a military leader
you need them to say we're going to win
this fight go into battle
you don't want them dwelling on the the
casualties that are coming
you you don't want your general to say
man they're going to be a lot of people
dead in this battle
you know two out of three of you are
gonna be dead but you know go out there
and do it anyway
that's not very motivating it's good
that people
know the risks but i think they do from
the experts from the pundits from the
news
and i i don't think it's wrong for the
president to
put the better spin on it that's
probably the right instinct
was it maureen maureen dowd said
in a tweet when trump walked through the
doors walter reed had a stellar
reputation
as he walks down 72 hours later his
reputation is in tatters
there's nothing trump can't ruin well
there's nothing he doesn't change
that's for sure and i have to admit i
would agree with her
that walter reed was diminished by this
experience
the the doctor who came out and lied
about
giving trump oxygen now he didn't
technically lie
right he weasel worded it so he didn't
have to answer the question
the first day then later he kind of
admitted that he lied but he didn't say
he lied
as soon as that happened as soon as i
saw that doctor conley was it
uh weasel word it's like did he get has
the president received oxygen
he's not on oxygen now um okay that's
not what we asked
has the president ever been on oxygen
for the coronavirus uh
going forward he is not going to be on
oxygen
okay sounds like you're lying to us
we'll try it again it has the president
ever in the past been on oxygen
well he's not on oxygen now
really now
you might say to yourself okay somebody
got to the doctor
and said okay doctor you know don't
mention this initial oxygen
because he's not on it now so it's not
that important you want to manage what
the
what the public thinks and somehow they
got this poor doctor to lie in public
i'm not happy about that right but i
also think it was his own damn fault
did anybody twist the doctor's arm to
make him lie
probably probably don't you think there
was a little arm twisting going on
behind the scenes
doctor whatever you do don't mention
that oxygen that i got on day one
it would mean a lot to me now doctor
doesn't want to get fired
right the doctor doesn't want to get
fired by the president
because handling the president is a big
honor it's like a feather in your cap
you don't want to get fired from that
and you know the president would fire
you he would
the doctor would fire a president in a
heartbeat if he wasn't getting what he
wanted
so was was the doctor
directly or by implication or even by
reputation since
trump is a fire yo was he coerced
into lying probably probably
but whose fault is it still the doctor
you know nobody moved his lips all right
he had a choice
and i think that the reputation of
walter reed definitely took a hit
because of the that first lie after that
every you don't you don't
believe anything after the first one um
let's see what else we got going on here
here's here's a better way that i would
uh frame
the president's leadership as you saw
from the
jake tapper comment which was um
you know you you knew that he was
vulnerable to this comment that the
president was vulnerable
the comment being that the president
blundered into
getting the coronavirus and now he's
trying to act as though it was part of
his leadership
to get the virus and show that he could
live through it or something
and of course that's very mockable
position
all right somebody's saying that the
hipaa laws or why the doctor
couldn't answer that question that's not
good enough
i know what you're saying but that's not
good enough because the doctor obviously
could have gotten permission to
say anything he wanted or he could have
said i'm just not talking about that
first day
he didn't have to lie that was a choice
so here's a better framing instead of
saying that uh
you know he he got it so that i don't
know
as part of good leadership i would say
it this way
that the country values freedom
over absolute safety right
the country values freedom over
absolute safety and that's a really
strong frame
because you say that and people when as
soon as you hear that
you might want to argue with it and you
say yes but
okay well that's just true the country
values
freedom over absolute safety
and that what the president was doing
was modeling exactly that
the president was he was
experiencing his own freedom meaning he
was a little lacks with the masks and
the social
distancing and that freedom had a price
he paid the price right and he's asking
other people to similarly
to value freedom first that's going to
get you your economic success it's going
to get you some
you know benefits that way but value
freedom
and the economic goodness that comes
with it
just no it's not free
if if the president said to the public
we're going to take our freedom back
and it's going to be expensive how do
you feel about that
not bad right we're going to take our
freedom back
from the coronavirus a little bit at a
time we're going to be smart about it
we're going to listen to the experts but
we're going to take our freedom back
we're going to do it the right way but
we're going to take our freedom back
and some people are not going to make it
some people are not going to make it if
you say that
some of you won't make it we're going to
take our freedom back
be smart be strong
be brave but just know
we're not all going to make it how do
you feel about that message
it works right because it suddenly
puts the entire 200 000 people who died
into a different frame
if what we were trying to do is save
every person
that's pretty bad performance but we
weren't
there was never a point where we said to
ourselves let's save
everybody never said that there was a
point where we were always consciously
saying
really every point we're gonna trade
freedom for safety and then we're gonna
you know we're gonna
tweak it as we go because we don't know
if we gave up too much freedom
didn't get enough safety we're gonna
have to keep tweaking this thing
but it's a it's a freedom versus
um versus safety if you make it
economics
versus health you've already lost
right is at the moment you say all right
the frame is economics
money you know money you capitalist
greedy
pigs you fascist money
economics versus you're gonna let
grandma die
are you are you serious grandma's gonna
die
for your fascist economic selfish
money so that's a terrible frame
economics versus health
freedom versus risk
totally different we're all designed
to understand freedom versus risk you
make that decision every time you get in
a car
every time you get your car you're not
making an
economics versus health decision are you
you're making a freedom versus risk
it ends up being similar but sounds
better that way
so that's the way i'd go um
and that is what i wanted to talk about
today
so i'm gonna sign off from periscope
uh you youtube people i'll be here for
another minute
so i'll talk to you later
all right youtubers it's just us now
yes franklin said those who love safety
over freedom will have
neither uh
all right just go look at your comments
here as we uh get ready to wind down
what's my election prediction you know
i would say that the uh the slaughter
meter as i like to call it
had been pinned at 100 but we are right
in the
middle of the third act right now so
this is the
the point when the slaughter meter
should be the lowest
if everything is on plan i would say the
slaughter meter today is
probably at uh 30
probably 30 now don't panic because the
slaughter meter does not predict the
election that's not what it's for
it predicts how things are going today
so
every day is different you know today it
could be 200 percent of the slaughter
meter very easily
just any event happens
so keep in mind i would say that
this should be the lowest point for the
slaughter meter
and that you should see you should see
some big changes
now if the president takes the framing
that i suggested
of freedom versus risk
he could recover quite quite quickly if
he keeps it as
economics versus life and death
and tries to tries to minimize the life
and death part
while maximizing the economic part
it's not as strong so we'll see
um yeah you know the whole story about
the
extra documents that gina haskell has
over at the cia
and there there's some uh reported
i don't believe it but there's some
reports that gina haskell
uh might be trying to slow walk the
release of some documents because she
she could personally be embarrassed in
some way
maybe maybe but i'll tell you one thing
if trump
does not win re-election all of that uh
all all of the plotters behind
the russia collusion hoax they'll all go
free
if trump doesn't win all of that will
just go away
john brennan will will be uh
completely off the hook so there's a lot
at stake
all right just looking at your comments
now
somebody says if trump doesn't win enjoy
civil war
here's what i think i think that there's
basically no chance of a civil war
there's a hundred percent chance that
there'll be violence in the streets
if trump wins but it's not going to be
the kind of violence
that is a whole you know a whole
different standard than what we've seen
for the last several months
i think it'll just be more of that and
there'll be you know it might be
a lot more of that in the beginning but
i don't think it lasts
i think people will just get used to it
somebody says i'm wrong on civil war so
there's somebody here wants to take a
bet on civil war
i'll make a bet against the civil war
and here are the factors i look at
how many people in your neighborhood are
in favor of civil war
in my neighborhood i think the number
might be zero
i don't think there's anybody in my
neighborhood who wants a civil war
probably the total number of people in
this country who won a civil war
it's like 0.001 percent
now what would keep those people from
being enough because it doesn't take
many people
to topple a country right if they do it
right
i would argue that uh we have a
superpower in this country
and it's called gun ownership have you
noticed that the
all of the protests they're staying
within a certain level of violence
meaning that it's mostly you know clubs
and umbrellas and
you know pepper spray and bottles of
water and stuff
the reason it doesn't escalate to actual
guns
is that they're they're outgunned the
minute that the protesters
went to the next level where they they
started shooting at
every event well it would get closed
down
so the government would close it down if
it became guns
if the government didn't close it down
and
and it started spreading into the
suburbs and there was real gunfire every
time
the the armed americans would just snuff
them out in about
a weekend with there are so many guns in
this country
we i don't know if it's a civil
war could happen unless you actually had
something like
30 percent of the country wanted to do
it you don't get a civil war
well let me let me summarize the
situation with in which you will not
have a civil war
is if the only people who want it are
0.001
of the public and and the and is
important
and we are armed to the teeth
in every household because it's armed to
the teeth
that makes it impossible for the small
numbers
to become you know bigger and to take
over a small number
could bully people you just bully them
if they didn't have guns
if you could just go to somebody's house
push in their door
and bully them into doing whatever you
wanted
you probably could have a pretty big
revolution with a very small number of
people
or revolutionaries but when they're
armed
the only way you're going to take over
the suburbs is with more power
and you don't have more power because
the suburbs are just bristling with
weapons
so i'm not worried at all about a
revolution we will work it out
that's the good news and i'll talk to
you tomorrow
