good morning everybody what a beautiful
day
look outside
you're still alive
sun
might be out depending on where you are
and if the sun isn't out it's a
beautiful evening and it's a perfect
time for the simultaneous sip
be it caffeinated or be it not
now i think we took care of the youtube
commercials that play before i get going
here so
if everything is working perfectly we're
about to enter an amazing phase it's
called the simultaneous sip you're all
going to be part of it yes yes you're
all going to be part of this and it's
going to be great and all you need is a
copper bug or a glass a tanker jealousy
style they can't eat yogurt flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
i like coffee
and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine hit of the day the thing that
makes everything better don't you feel
it
yeah things are getting better right now
and i haven't even sipped yet watch what
happens what i do here it comes the
simultaneous sip everybody go
now thank you
uh beverly beverly is obviously
experienced at the simultaneous step and
knew in the comments
to put the aaa hhh
pronounced
at exactly the right time
good simultaneous
expression there beverly
superstar
superstar well let's talk about the news
uh first an update on my cat boo the cat
who is uh still in the pet hospital
so she's not quite eating on her own so
she's still gotta be fed through the
little
cat feeding tube but she seems to be
her nerves seem to be good and she
should be back to me on sunday
i'll put her on camera
as soon as it's not too embarrassing
because she's going to have a lamp shade
on her head when she gets back
yeah she's about a twenty thousand
dollar cat
oh did i tell you that
that the bill for my veterinarian
experience with my cat will be about
twenty thousand dollars
but i lied
and i said that i said the cat bill
would be twenty thousand dollars
if people thought i don't believe that
that sounds too expensive well i'm here
to tell you that is not real
it's twenty thousand per year
twenty thousand per year
forty thousand
now i don't know if it'll hit forty
forty thousand but the first year is
going to be about twenty thousand
and she's got one ear to go because they
don't do them at the same time
now
is there was there any doubt that i
would pay 40 000 to save my cat
nope
not even a little bit
all right here's the good news bad news
uh
segment
good news uh a gentleman who had been
missing for some time has been found
has been found 71 year old was missing
and he has now been found
that's the good news
the bad news is that he was found in the
stomach of a 504 pound alligator
uh the part of this story that i don't
understand is if they weighed the
alligator before or after
the man was in his stomach
because if it was a 400 pound
500 pound alligator
and you added let's say a 200 pound man
it should be a 700 pound alligator at
least for a while
so i don't know if this was a 300 pound
alligator with a 200 man and 200 pound
man in his stomach
but it feels like mauro had to be
probably a 500 pound alligator
which maybe hit 700 pounds for for a
couple days
let's talk about the world's biggest
branding mistake
i like to talk about
current events
so that's why i'm talking about whale
oil
as dr interracial tweeted to me and
that's a really good file follow you
should follow dr interracial
um just just search for it on twitter
you'll find the handle
and tweeted this article to me and this
is something i
i thought i knew but not the details
which was
prior to the 1800s
most of the lighting
came from burning uh whale oil
so they would take the oil from the
whale put it in their little lamps and
that's how they made light prior to the
1800s but by the 1850s
we had access to kerosene and oil-based
products
and that saved the whales
so the way the whales were saved by the
fact that uh the oil industry came
online and it gave a substitute
for uh whale oil now that's one
explanation
as you know if you're watching any
current events in our current day
have you noticed that there are always
two movies
two completely different explanations
for how something happened or what
happened even
well that was true back in the 1800s as
well
and while we don't have access to all of
the documents i suspect that what really
happened with the
the whale oil industry is that they
branded it wrong
sure
maybe it was just economics
maybe it was just because it was a
cheaper substitute
but did you know that the way they
branded this whale oil
was not
whale oil but rather it was named after
the sperm whales from which it came and
so they called it sperm oil
so all of their lighting
came from sperm oil
now i remind you that these were
unsophisticated folks
unsophisticated folks these were not
people who had followed the science
i mean today we all follow the science
and we get the right answer every time
right am i right
we follow the science in 2021 and we all
get the same answer and we get it every
time and it works every time
right
but back then it was harder
because they didn't follow the science
they were they were primitive people in
the 1800s they barely
barely knew what a smartphone was back
then
and
it turns out that when they named their
product sperm oil
and they temporarily ran out of it
well confusion rained confusion rained
now
some of those people
probably said you know
i'm gonna have to find another
source of sperm oil
and they went and bought some at the
store
others
and i won't name names
may have said to themselves hmm
if sperm oil
will power my lamp
just maybe
it's worth a shot it's worth a shot
and so i suspect many
uh lighting products were completely
ruined
by people experimenting at home
experimenting at home for a substitute
but uh in the in the end it turns out
that kerosene was a better substitute
for sperm oil
than uh making it at home
so uh you don't need your butter churn
if you know what i mean you know what i
mean butter churn know what i mean know
what i mean you don't need to churn your
own butter
you can just buy some kerosene or just
turn on the lights it's electricity now
favorite story of the day that did not
involve
sperm oil
is that you know the tv show the view
the view
well
you have to watch this clip
i don't often
refer you to clips
from the view
but i'm gonna do it now
you have to watch the clip
of the view going live
and being informed by their producer
while they're live that two of them
tested positive for covid and they have
to leave right now
get out of here right now and this was
right before they were going to do a
interview with vice president harris
which would have been you know a big
event on its own
and harris
quite rightly
immediately canceled
to you know not be in the environment
with wherever that comet had been
probably the right decision
and
you have to watch anna navarro and who
was the other one being
escorted out
now
so far they have no symptoms
can we be
can we be adults for a moment
all right just
yeah
yeah i know it it's going to be
difficult to not mention the anna
navarro might have a co-morbidity
right now we don't do fat shaming on
this live stream i'm i'm very dead set
against it
because for all the reasons i explain
all the time so we don't do fat shaming
but it is a medical uh fact which is
part of the story
and so far
neither the view hosts have any symptoms
but let's be adults
can we be adults for a moment
let's just wish them well
i'll leave it at that
all right i know you want me to dunk on
them and blah blah they were vaccinated
and they got it anyway and
blah blah blah comorbidities but
how about we just
we just
take a break
for a minute right because it's health
it's health related you don't have to
like anna navarro's political opinions
but let's just wish them well
speedy uh
i don't even know if they need to
recover but uh i hope they get past the
situation in the best possible way i'm
just gonna leave it there
give you a little positivity for the day
just a little bit
i won't make that a habit don't worry
[Laughter]
we'll be just as mean as we need to be
later up for today let's just say hope
things work out
all right um
biden continues to uh
decline in support uh even beto o'rourke
wrote a scathing op-ed scathing i tell
you
about the haitian immigrant situation
and how biden handled it i guess beto
wanted all the immigrants just to be led
in
for humanitarian reasons
and
biden used the same
rule as trump did
to send a lot of them back home so beto
was quite mad about that
apparently even
the biden administration's special envoy
to haiti resigned
over the way the haitian situation was
being handled
how many people have resigned from the
biden administration in protest so far
didn't we guess some
were there weren't there some
resignations about the afghanistan thing
not the generals but
didn't somebody
resign about afghanistan
am i remembering that correctly
so
so we've got some um
resignations i think trump had some
resignations too so it's sort of in the
baseline i guess
um
and there were 15 000 of them 15 000
refugees i guess
some number of them made it into the
country
so
when you watch biden losing the support
of the open borders people
uh
you wonder how how he could get
reelected i doubt he's going to run
again so probably doesn't matter for him
all right let's talk about booster shots
uh you've all heard this story
but it's kind of mind-boggling that it
can happen right in front of
you i i do you feel like this is the
truth there are so many stories that
come come across and we're always
looking for the new one and we're more
interested in the new one
that you can hear a story that is
absolutely like wrong meaning that
there's something happening that's just
so wrong
and you'll just accept it just to move
to the next story just to get on with it
you know just just to move on here's one
of those
i think we're just going to move on like
it never happened
that the the fda's vaccine experts
you know that they had a board of people
who were going to
vote on whether you should get boosters
of the vaccinations and by a vote of 16
to 2
which if you're doing the math here 16
to 2 is not close
16 to 2
is the most lopsided vote you'll ever
get
i mean it could have been zero but 16 to
two that's not close right and they
voted against the booster
the experts
16 to 2
and then their boss
who is not nearly the expert that they
are
decided that she would just agree with
biden and approve boosters
ignoring the experts
view of the science and the data
what
and what are we gonna do about this
apparently it'll just be a news story
for one day and then we'll just have
boosters
what
we're gonna let this go aren't we
i mean i will
you probably will too
for some reason i can't make myself make
this my big thing or
it just doesn't feel like where i want
to die on this hill or anything because
there's so many things that maybe need
to be better and things i could complain
about or things i know more about so i'm
more useful there
i feel like we're just going to let this
happen and then just let it happen
am i wrong about that
yeah i see individuals say you know
julie says i will not let it go but
i'll bet you will
about you will let it go
are you going to march
what are you going to do about it
i feel like we're so beaten down at this
point
that something as ridiculous as this
where they're all lecturing us about
using the science and then they decide
to use politics instead
right in the face of the science
and we're just going to go ah it's okay
that's okay
i'm not even sure what to do about this
i don't even know what to say about it
this is such
a a statement of human beings
that we're we're just gonna let this go
what
i mean i'm not going to march are you
what am i going to do about it nothing
pay my taxes
it's just not quite big enough of a
problem
not quite big enough and not quite
directed to me quite enough
that i can't get activated by it i don't
know why it seems like i should
but i can't
so that's really the surprising part of
this story is that
we're gonna treat it like it's not that
big of a story
i don't know how it could be bigger
um oh let me clarify gary is mentioning
i'm distorting what happened
they were approved for over age 65 i
think the details were that they were
approved for people in the high risk
category
right
so i believe the board of people said no
in general
but that the approval was only you know
narrowly for the high high risk people
but
she'll
she'll
skid buff do you even know what words
mean
are you just like do you have a
dictionary and you're just like picking
out a word
chill
shield
what am i showing for
did i not just tell you a story in which
the scientists said don't give boosters
so
i'm shilling for the boosters
who's showing for what
it's a story about how the boosters were
turned down by the scientists
what am i shilling for
see
there there's a thing
that needs a name it's a phenomenon
i would call it automatic thinking
a lot of people have some kind of
automatic thinking where they just make
an association then they're done
he's talking about trump or something
therefore
it's really weird
anyway
speaking of
vaccinations kaiser researchers
did a deep dive on their own records
to find out if there were any serious
health effects so far
from the mrna vaccines the two of them
what do you think they found
nope
so
i don't know that you can
trust any data ever anywhere
just in general i'm not sure that any
data is
credible these days but at least in the
way this was collected
there's a little bit of credibility
because kaiser
can know for sure who got vaccinated
because they do the vaccinations
so kaiser can know which of their
members got vaccinated and when and
which vaccination they got and they can
then check their records over time and
find out how many of those people who
got vaccinated came in
and had health outcomes that were
statistically different from the
unvaccinated
that's a really really good source of
information isn't it
because kaiser's records i think are
pretty darn good i mean if you go to
kaiser for a whatever
that word will be
in kaiser's records
right
kaiser will have a record if you came in
for anything
so they can very easily match 6.2
million patients
remember the biggest problem we seem to
have with studies is it's a small small
group
they could study 6.2 million people
and track them from for months and
months and months and know for sure
if they had more
health problems than other people what
do you think happened
what do you think happened when kaiser
tracked 6.2 million people and found out
how many health problems they had
compared to the
normal public
the answer is
no difference
no difference
now
i'm not so sure
like i said that you can trust any data
it just feels like we can't trust
anything anymore but
i would point out to you that
kaiser is
really uniquely
situated
to have exactly the right data
right
the kaiser definitely has the data
so the only uncertainty is whether they
analyzed it correctly
and you know uh i guess we'd like to see
uh second opinions
um
but
that's the best news we've had in a long
time isn't it the even the myocarditis
risk for ages 12 to 39
you you would think that that would be a
big problem right because you keep
hearing the story as oh the young people
have the myocarditis
nope
it doesn't they did find it it's a real
thing that really is in the data but
it's so small it's it's basically
nothing
i think there were six out of a million
and uh almost all of the people
recovered fine in a day or two
so even the people who got the
myocarditis almost all of them got
better right away
right
so
i don't know this is the best thing
we've heard now the remaining risk if
you were to believe the these numbers
are correct and that the mrna has
basically zero
zero
uh problematic side effects none
couldn't find any
after months and months and months the
only remaining risk is like the long
long term
and what are the odds
that if you can't find a problem in a
year
or how long has it been has it been a
year let's say let's say six months if
you can't find a problem in six months
with a vaccination what are the odds
that you will ever find one
go
in the comments answer this question for
me i don't know the answer by the way so
i want to see what you say
if if you don't find any problem in six
months with a vaccination
what are the odds that it has longer
term problems i see 25 percent
i see zero i see one percent
i see z very very low 500 to one
yeah two to three years would be better
right longer is better no doubt about it
low
somebody says 100
10
um i don't know the answer to the
question certainly less than 10
i feel i feel safe in saying that is it
less than one percent
it might be i think it's less than one
percent
so probably at this point you're you're
in the uh
well over 99 chance that it's not going
to be
you who has this weird health and
income or health
impact
all right
so again we don't know if we can trust
that data but there it is so the arizona
audit came out and uh
big surprise
big surprise
the arizona audit i know you won't
believe this
two movies have formed
yeah i know surprising in this day and
age who predicted that two movies would
form i did
was it hard to predict no because it
happens every time
so it happens when something happens
every time and you predict it you're not
really a genius
you've just been paying attention
all right so so the way it went was
that the hand count was about right
so the hand count usually is the big
thing you think about right
count the ballots were did they go
through the machines correctly
yes
now
uh are we done
the hand count showed roughly you know
the same in fact it showed that biden
had more votes
but here's the second movie
uh most of the systems didn't balance
with each other
uh there were like 28 000 ballots cast
from different states they think files
were missing ballot images were corrupt
or missing logs were intentionally
rolled over batches not always clearly
de-eliminated some originals were
duplicated and the chain of custody
documents
were missing
what's missing from this list
is
correct me if i'm wrong but they didn't
audit any of the technology
right
was there anybody who wanted this
software or hardware of the systems
and the final database
i doubt it
so
it was a deeply incomplete
audit
because they don't have access to all
the stuff the good stuff they need
and they found lots and lots of problems
not enough it seems that would
necessarily lead you to believe that it
was a fraudulent election
i'd say the evidence is not there
the evidence
is not there doesn't mean it didn't
happen
because as i explained you couldn't
check everything
and if you can't check everything have
you really done an audit
no
what good is an audit
if the people doing the cheating know
what you can check and what you can't
let me ask that again because when you
hear it it'll make you mad
what is the point of an audit
if the people who presumably would cheat
know what things can be found in an
audit and what things can't
why would they do the things that can be
found in an audit why would they do
those
if they can just do the other things
they know the things that won't get
caught
let me ask you this did they audit find
how many ballots were discarded before
accounting
how could they
how could they find that out
how is that even possible
now they didn't find any uh evidence
that there were discounted
ballots i didn't hear of that
but how could you find it if somebody
did a good job of
of throwing it away
sofloart says you are naive
so soflo what kind of art do you do
we have an artist here
who would like to criticize my
analytical abilities
and you know if
if you're looking for somebody who's got
keen analytical abilities
you want an artist
so
don't pay attention to anything i say
with my economics degree and
my mba and my
16 years of corporate experience across
many industries and my
deep deep talent stack which crosses a
number of different business models
don't pay attention to any of that
because we have an artist in the house
and that's how you get your analytical
stuff
from your artists
all right i i have this idea for if
trump runs again
i think he plans to
you know short of any surprises between
now and the time he has to announce
but if he trump if he runs again
um here's what i think the mood of the
nation requires as a slogan
get your freedom back
you do terrible research scott
do i
do i do terrible research i'm just
looking at the comments on youtube do i
do terrible research
i don't think i do any do i
it's more like i tell you what i've seen
and and ask you to research it and see
if it's right so i mean the main
theme of this live stream is that nobody
knows anything we're all wrong
and we better be fact checking each
other
so if you're fact checking my bad
research you're doing the right thing
if you think my research should be right
from the beginning you don't understand
a thing about the world because
nobody's research is right
do you know whose research you should
trust
what about that artist
when don't you trust their research
once you're how about cbs
you trust them
whose research do you trust do you do
your own
do you do your own research
you should try that
do your own research
because i hear that's a really good
thing to do
 idiot all right
um
so i think if trump runs again get your
freedom back
would be a great rally and cry and the
beauty of this is that both sides think
their freedom has been taken away
this is the weird thing
both sides i've never seen this quite
before both sides want their freedom
back but they want it in a different way
very different way
the way the left wants their freedom
back let's or maybe it's not even the
left maybe it's more the
the pro vaccine pro-vaccination people
they think their freedom is being
inhibited by the non-vaccinated people
so to them getting their freedom back
means forcing you to get vaccinated
because that's how they can go out
without a mask someday get their freedom
back
but the freedom for you is the exact
opposite
that uh you don't want to have to get
vaccinated if you don't want to
and you want to go wherever you want
like the old days just like he used to
so both the vaccinated and unvaccinated
want to get their freedoms back they
just have a different idea what that
means
but the mood of the country is
correct me if i'm wrong
the mood of the country is somebody's
taking my freedoms
like you feel that don't you
know you feel that that your freedoms
are being eaten up no matter who you are
i think you do i think that would be a
strong
and also it's like make america great
again it's generic enough that you can
read into it what you want to read into
it and that's a good slogan
democrats have a new text proposal
uh or at least it's being floated let's
say
and it would
cause the wealthiest americans to pay an
annual tax
on any gains in their asset portfolio
and biden said he's in favor of you know
looking at that and other things as well
what do you think of that idea
economists or artists are there any
artists here who would like to weigh in
because artists are are really good um
for analyzing economics if there are any
artists here is this a good idea
to tax how much rich people made just on
the gain in their assets
any problem with that
uh you know there's a big problem with
that
yeah
yeah they're unrealized
how do you tax unrealized gains they're
unrealized meaning that they haven't yet
sold their stocks
so the stocks can still go down
what happens when they go down
do you get your money back do you get a
dick did you get a discount
so what happens if your stock goes up
one year
next year it goes down 20 percent
you don't get a discount
and then the next year it just goes back
to where it was
you get taxed
for your stocks
going back to where you bought them
come on
this is the worst idea
ever it's not it's not even an idea you
can say is good or bad
it's so bad you can't even analyze it as
good or bad it's not even
a thing
you can't even describe it
right so you can't analyze whether
something is good or bad if you can't
even describe it in a way that makes
sense because the you know the the
sample i gave you is that
stocks go up and down every year if it's
a down year if you don't get a discount
this is not going to fly and there's no
way you could get a discount right this
is not going to happen
so there's no way
logically and math-wise you could tax
that asset and do you want to
you know do you want to tax it
most of your investments have been taxed
already
corporate tax
and those are going to go up too
so it's bad on every level it's bad for
incentive it's bad because you couldn't
handle it it's unfair it targets certain
people it's racist it's super racist by
the way
why are we not talking about that
how is it not racist to tax the
wealthiest americans who are
largely in a couple of different
demographic groups
am i right
if if if this were a proposed tax that
happened to hit black americans the
hardest
forget about
let's just imagine it's a case where
there's no difference in economic
situation
if it affected black people the most it
would be racist
just by definition this one affects
white people the most but because these
white people are wealthy we don't give a
right
you can totally be racist against rich
white people
you could probably be racist against
rich black people
couldn't you because you can kind of do
anything about rich people nobody gives
a
so
um
but we're not talking about this being
racist at all
even though it's super super racist and
anti-anti-semitic
good point this tax would be not only
racist but anti-semitic
because of its
proportionate effect on one group of
people versus another is it intentional
do you think that the democrats find it
intentional that they would tax the
wealthiest americans who just happen to
be
very white on average
do you think that's an intentional
choice
to tax people of a certain ethnicity
sure looks like it
i don't think anybody says it out loud
but would they be taxing this group if
it were a different ethnicity
probably not
now i'm not even saying they shouldn't
do it
all right forget about the argument of
you know whether it's right or wrong or
you know what's
what's the best way to do it i'm just
saying that they're targeting an ethnic
group
and it's pretty blatant
but we're okay with that i guess we're
okay with it because it's a rich group
all right uh as jonathan turley
correctly points out he's another person
you should definitely be following on
social media
um he talked about uh whip gate you know
the the fake news that the border
patrols on horse horses were using whips
to whip the haitian refugees
back into place so they didn't cross the
border
now
uh as time goes by we find out that the
border patrol whipping people wasn't so
much border patrol whipping people
because they didn't have whips
that's right it's a story about people
on horses with whips
and nobody had a whip
there were zero whips there were rains
the horses had rains and those rains
were used
to hit the horse
as rains are used not to hurt the horse
but to hit the horse in a way that
you wouldn't have you navigate with a
horse
all right
and so the photos were a little
misleading and it made it look like
maybe those rains were a whip or
something but once the photographer and
all the people there weighed in we
realized there was no whipping
not with rains
not with whips no human was hit with a
rain or a whip
no human tried to hit a human with a
rain or a whip
nothing like that happened even remotely
okay
do we all agree it just didn't happen
okay
uh
but once the news had reported that it
did happen
how do they
how do they back out of that
like what do you do if you're a news
organization and you just reported it
happened but it didn't happen
how do you correct yourself well here's
cbs news taking a run at it
look at this exact
phrase
it said that they have footage of border
patrol
quote using horse rains on migrants
using horse rains
on migrants
what's that mean
because they took the whip part out but
now they're using the horse reins on
migrants
but they're not actually touching the
migrants with the horse reigns we know
that now because you know we have better
information
so if no horoscopes have touched any
migrants
are they using the horse rains on the
migrants well in an indirect sense
because they're using the horse rains on
the horse and the horse is being used on
the migrants
so it's sort of like it's almost on the
edge of
knocking on the door of on the welcome
mat of
something that's true
but it's not true
i mean it's basically written to look
misleading without being as fake as it
used to be when they said it was a whips
and they were whipping the migrants now
they're just horse rains and you they're
being used on migrants
is using the horse rains on the migrants
the same as hitting them with a horse
raid
because it doesn't say they hit them it
says they use them
on the migrants
yeah pretty weaselly
writing there isn't it
but as jonathan turley pointed out and i
forgot to mention
got all excited about this other part
is that when biden weighed in and said
that he was going to make these people
pay the people who allegedly were
whipping
migrants but in fact were not
so biden basically the boss
says he's going to make him pay
now there's going to be an investigation
into it and are the people who
investigated it
going to be worried about the fact that
their boss already concluded the answer
if you are assigned to investigate
something that your boss has already
concluded the answer to
what answer do you give your boss
do you give your boss an answer that's
going to make your boss look like a turd
and an idiot
no you don't you give your boss whatever
hell answer gets you paid
and that's a problem as jonathan turley
points out
it's a big
problem um
the rains are not to be used as whips
why are they so long
um the the rains are long because they
have some whipping action right
isn't it the whole point of it that the
the horse can detect
the long reign and it does hit the horse
right
am i wrong about that
there would be no reason for them to be
so long with their
they seem to be you know manipulating
them so no i'm not a big horse writer
but i don't think any of that matters to
the point i'm making
all right
um
has biden apologized yet for being so
wrong and blaming his employees and
throwing them under the bus i don't
believe so
i believe biden but i believe biden
should be on the phone to those very
people on the horses and saying my god
i'm sorry i said that once once we know
that you weren't doing that i apologize
profusely
and my question is is trump already
trying to get the phone numbers of those
guys
i hope so
don't you think trump
should call the guys on the horses that
were being blamed and personally talk to
him and say look
if i were president we wouldn't be
having this conversation
yeah
um ted cruz was challenging a professor
in a congressional hearing about voter
id laws and what about them is racist
and the um i guess there were two
experts there who had the same take
which is that the voter
voter id laws can be racist because the
intent
is to be racist
do you buy that argument
that if the intention of tight voter id
laws is to reduce voting for one team
then it's race and that team happens to
be mostly black
um or a lot of black people on that team
it would look racist
what do you think
it's the intention
the intention matters not the thing
no
and now the courts have ruled
that apparently in the past these have
been done
for the intention
of changing the vote
in a particular way so the courts have
found that
but
does it matter that's your intent
doesn't it also doesn't matter mostly
that it's a good idea
because if you implement a good idea
that's just everybody would agree with
and it changes the mix of who votes
and it was your intention
is that wrong
so let me give you the scenario again
you make a change that everybody agrees
needs to be done
but
unlike the other people who also think
it needs to be done exactly the way you
did it
the way you're thinking about it is oh
my secret plan is to
is to win the elections by changing who
votes
but the other people who don't have that
secret intention
just want a more accurate vote with
voter id
so
is the fact that one group of people
wants to do it for nefarious reasons
does that make it something you
shouldn't do because the other people
who don't have nefarious reasons also
want it for their own reasons because
it's just good hygiene
i don't know
feels to me that you could have any
intention you want
because you know what's not illegal
thinking about not yet
i mean in in the uh
i guess in the domain of a crime your
intent to commit the crime you know can
be a factor but
if you're just deciding what is a good
law and law is a good law but also it
might help somebody
the fact that it's a good law should be
enough
the fact that other people have
nefarious intent
i don't think you can manage to that
that's no precedent you'd want
so the um
one of the examples given was that uh
texas
um
restricted the types of idea that they
would accept for example allegedly they
don't accept federal state or student
ids
for voting
and the effect of that would be lower
income people and a lot of minorities
would not have the regular ideas but
they might have a student id federal or
state id
have you ever heard that before
have you ever heard that texas had that
restriction and other states do not
is it a big problem that people are
using fake i don't know student ids or
federal or state ids is that a big
problem
do we do we have some sense that a lot
of people with fake ids of these lesser
kinds you know federal state or student
ids
are people voting with a lot of fake ids
like that
paul says i live in texas and it's bs so
i'm seeing in the comments people saying
that none of this is true
which part is not true
apparently they can use
state issued you know regular ids
driver's license and regular ids from
the state
uh oh are these cards that don't have
pictures is that is that the distinction
because students have pictures
lots of students have fake ideas
somebody says
but lots of people have fake driver's
licenses
um
texas will provide free state ids but
yeah texas will provide state ids but
apparently the
access to them is something that's hard
to navigate if you're in a low-income
group so you can get them but we know
that a lot of people it's too much of a
barrier
they don't i don't think those same
people were voting so i don't know if it
makes any difference
um lots of people are fake students
you can't get into a federal building
without real how that okay you can't get
into a federal building without a real
id
so
um
so this is one of those cases where both
things can be true
it can be true that the voter id laws
are just good laws
and it can be true that they had racist
intent does anybody disagree with that
can't both be true
the intention could be racist and it
could still be a good law that a
reasonable person would want it just
happens to have a racial outcome just
like
just like taxing the wealthy
taxing the wealthy
is racist as
but it's probably not the reason they're
doing it i mean it might be one reason
but it's also where the money is you
have to go after the money
all right
uh
i heard yesterday that alex jones has
some scoops on biden
that
if they're true
are going to be really interesting
now
i don't want to tell you
the exact nature of the scoop
but alex jones claims that he has some
insiders and security details
that um have some
some stories about let's say biden's
dementia
and i don't want to give you details
because i don't know that they're true
and he hasn't revealed them yet so uh he
revealed some and i'm not going to tell
you those but
you know the the story with alex jones
right the the
uh the beautiful thing about him
is that he does get stories right
and he gets them before other people
now has everything he's ever said panned
out
no no
has everything that anybody has said in
public panned out no no name a
name a person who does the same job as
alex jones you know talks about politics
in the news
name eddie is everything that they said
panned out
is everything that the hosts on cnn say
true
fox news you know the opinion people
we're talking about not the news people
but the opinion people
i don't know i i feel like uh
if you're gonna criticize alex jones for
getting stuff wrong
you gotta you gotta put it in context
everybody doing what he does gets stuff
wrong there's no exception
have i gotten things wrong
yeah yeah yeah we get stuff wrong it's
the nature of the job
but he also gets some things right
that you didn't see coming and this is a
big one
if he gets this one right so this is
just sort of a a heads up wait and see
you know as soon as it drops
let's talk about it
but uh
all right so i guess uh biden talked to
modi
from india and modi was in the united
states and uh
apparently biden was heard saying to him
um when they were
in the situation in front of the press
he said the indian press is much better
behaved than the american press biden
said
chuck ross an investigative reporter at
the washington free beacon
did a little research and found out that
the indian
news business is ranked
142nd in the world in press freedom
uh russia is 150th
u.s the us is 44.
that's nothing to brag about right the
u.s is only 44th
in in press freedom
what
don't you think we should be in the top
10 in press freedom
i mean really
but if
here's something that trump could run on
trump could run on this statistic
that the us is 44th
in press freedom
and just say look we need press freedom
to get into the top 10
or the top 10 let's say
i think people would agree with that no
matter what side you're on you want your
press to be in the top 10
end of the world
but he also said biden said
and apparently this was
maybe not reported in the
in the redoubt but he said to modi i
think with your permission the president
said to modi you cannot answer questions
because they won't ask any questions on
point
now of course that's true
that they weren't going to ask any
questions that were on point
but
that's always the case
why is this the first time that you
don't have to answer questions they
always ask off point questions at these
events
anyway
that
is your news for the day
let me take a look at your comments and
see what you like the most or hated the
most
um can anyone point out things are
better after months of biden yes yes
things are much better
for example
have you noticed that your
your pulse is down
and that you're not your hair isn't on
fire as much
i have to say
that
while i'm bored to death with the biden
administration
they are less stressed
can anybody say that they have more
stress this year from politics just
specifically i know life is kind of hard
at the moment but from politics
specifically
do you have more stress or less stress
without trump in office
i'm seeing yeses i've seen more stress
a lot of people in local say more
oh we've got lots of disagreement on
this
more stress
yeah it's a different kind of stress
though but it's not a stress about
trump saying something and now you have
to defend it or explain it or talk about
it or
something
more stress well there's definitely more
stress
in terms of things going wrong
that's a different sense
nuclear suitcase
stress you know what
i don't think the nuclear suitcase is
even connected
if you were the person who designed the
nuclear suitcase
would you put a timer in there that just
turned it off as soon as you released it
so that even if they tried to launch a
nuclear war the suitcase wouldn't work
you know you no matter how many times
you tested it would look like it works
but if you were the actual programmer
you'd put in a little little code in
there that if you actually tried to use
it in the real world not just the test
it just wouldn't work
because what's the point
what's the point
all right um i'm not saying that's a
good idea i just wonder
some people saying they just gave up
don't give up
we're just entering the golden age it's
going to be great
uh every any input on evergrand so
there's big some big chinese company
that
what defaulted on their debt or
something
i don't have any special input input on
that except that china is in trouble
and let me let me make this offer again
if there's if there are any companies
considering starting to do business in
china i'm not counting the ones who are
already there and you know they have a
big financial commitment
so they've got a different situation but
if there's anybody who's a big company
who's beginning to do or considering
doing business in china let me know
because
if there's one thing that the creator of
dilbert can do is embarrass a big
company
and if you'd like me to embarrass a big
company for even considering moving into
china
to do business let's say for
manufacturing
i would like to know about that
i will i will take that quite personally
and i will make sure that they get
embarrassed in public
because the one thing i can guarantee
you is that when the
the guy who created dilbert targets your
company
you hear about it
it gets back to you pretty quickly
um
china is also cracking down on economic
freedom yes they're moving to more of a
socialist
model but also there's a lot of
corruption there
so they do need to get the corruption
under control
yep fentanyl we'll talk about that
another time
you won't go after tesla
um
oh go after tesla for having production
facilities in china that tesla i think
is an example of of
businesses that were already committed
so i'm not gonna
make the same uh comments about anybody
who already committed you know gigantic
amounts of money agreements were made
you know maybe you need to
live with those
but you don't need to move new business
in there
all right um
show description visual of the whip and
the
and the biden and the sperm
china sold banks initial license that
allowed them to open up offices that's
all okay i don't know the details of
that story
all right um
quit shilling for adam schiff's gold
company i don't know what that means
um
are u.s corporations still outsourcing
jobs that's what i want to know i
haven't heard of any lately
thank you
once you drive a tesla other cars are
boring
could be
oh peter schiff
oh peter schiff not adam chef yes that's
a big difference
all right um
can you do a micro lesson on paying
attention that's a good question
i i've actually gotten um multiple
requests
from people who can't pay attention to
boring things
and it's way worse than it used to be i
mean it's always been hard to pay
attention to boring things but because
our uh our attention span is so
segmented now and our phones have ruined
us for anything that's long form i can't
watch a half hour
tv show
because half hour is way too much to
commit to anything
and a movie is just out of the question
can you imagine watching a three-hour
movie now
it feels like churning your own butter
at this point watching a three-hour
movie that's really just the director's
masturbatory
take on things that has nothing to do
with the audience's enjoyment
yeah
anyway
i don't know if i have a secret for how
to concentrate on things but let me give
you
i do have a series of things
which i have trained people individually
on so yeah i'll do that i'll do i'll do
a micro lesson it'll only be on the
locals platform
subscription platform on how to improve
your ability to pay attention i do have
some ideas on that but you're not going
to love them
they they work but they're not as easy
as you hope they will be
um
you almost try paula deens
okay
the ford f-150 will be able to charge
your home if the lights go out yeah
that's um
watching
energy being
moved to automobiles is a real
interesting experiment because it seems
to be you could get to the point where
if you had a major outage
you could have a bunch of electric cars
that are fully charged just you know
pull up to a building and plug in and
power the building for a while
for a few hours or something
i i feel like there's
something we could be doing a lot more
of
with the fact that we're putting energy
in automobiles and those automobiles can
take that energy wherever they want it
um
singularity level military power coming
it has to that's inevitable
how to lose fat
well i i would recommend my book had to
uh failed almost everything and still
win big if you want to get your diet
or your fitness or your career or
anything that requires a system
under control that's the book that tells
you how to create a system for yourself
one one that works for you
um
carbs are poison
to a large extent yes
and monkey exercises that could be a
good
micro lesson too all right um that's all
for now and i will talk to you tomorrow
youtube thanks for joining me see you
tomorrow
