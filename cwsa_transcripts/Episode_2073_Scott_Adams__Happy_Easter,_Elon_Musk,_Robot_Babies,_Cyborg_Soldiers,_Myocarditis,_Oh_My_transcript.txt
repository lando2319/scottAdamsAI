oh a little Overexposed
let's get a little less light on that
yeah that's better
good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of civilization
it's called coffee with Scott Adams and
it's the best Easter entertainment
you've ever had
in your whole life let me put you in the
center put me in the center of the frame
there we go
and
I think if you'd like to take this up a
level
and I know you would all you need is a
copper mug or a glass of tanker charles'
style and a canteen jug of flask a
vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid
I like coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine
the other day the thing that makes
everything better it's called
simultaneous sip
it happens now
go
ah
well I was just alerted to the fact that
the dunesbury comic is apparently taking
a
uh well I won't say that let me let me
just read it you can make up your own
mind
about whether this is a supportive or
not
so it shows the two older older couple
one's reading a newspaper
newspapers still exist in this comic
world
and the young person comes in and
um
the young person says okay so I've been
thinking about the Raw Deal that
canceled cartoonist got
and the mom says oh honey what before
you say anything let me make a quick
Point all life is editing it's the
things we may think but don't say that
make it bearable to live in the world
civilization absolutely depends on it
the father says agreed just because you
have the right to spew transgressive
crap doesn't mean you must especially if
it hurts people
so editing is in your own self-interest
son it protects you from your basis
instincts then the son says okay okay
but I'll still miss Garfield
but not from ignorance
now what do you think
transgressive
now it's interesting it didn't mention
racist
interesting anyway I don't know what to
make of that frankly but happy Easter
and uh
because Easter is a day for big
comebacks
I thought I would do a poll on Twitter
to find out now that some time has
passed since my cancellation
I asked do people think that
Dilbert was canceled because its author
is a racist or because the people who
canceled him are racists
and a month later uh
four percent think the problem is that
the author is a racist and 96 percent
either think that races canceled Scott
or that everybody's a racist
so it was 96 percent
on my side
so happy Easter I think I timed that
just right
just right
all right
well enough about that I have a
prediction about robots robot prediction
coming in
have you noticed how people who don't
have children
sometimes we'll treat their animals as
like their child
have you ever noticed that
it's like oh my my baby my cat my baby
my dog whatever
now that makes perfect sense because
people have sort of a parental you know
Instinct maternal Instinct
Etc
but
in the context of the actual human
population decreasing
Italy being a prime example population
is dropping fast and other Western
countries our populations are going to
be dropping fast
don't you think people are going to have
robot babies
now they might not be in baby form they
might be adult robots but don't you
think that people are going to be
bringing them up and training them to be
the character and the personality that
they want them to be and won't you be
able to customize your robot by its
experience
won't robots all end up having different
personalities because they would have
their own personal experience on top of
their programming
yeah I think people are going to be
raising robot babies and it's going to
be the end of human civilization
because people are going to prefer the
robot
because it won't ever die you don't have
to worry about it dying you could just
have it backed up
all the risks of having a child could be
removed and you can still get some kind
of parental satisfaction
I know you're saying not me not me I
need the real kids but I'm saying that
some people will do it not you
not you necessarily but I think it's
going to be a big deal people are going
to be raising robots
because you will actually train them to
be more to your liking that's raising
them
all right well let's talk about all
things uh
oh here's some more robot stuff so the
military is testing out some
enhanced reality goggles that their
soldiers could wear and apparently it
can do all kinds of stuff like you can
see the whole field as if it you're
looking down from it so you can see
where everybody is you can communicate
you can do your GPS you can have night
vision goggles and who knows what else
but man by the time you add those Vision
related things to a soldier
you are pretty much a cyborg aren't you
I mean that's almost as much technology
as there is human flesh almost by weight
as well because the the technical parts
of the backpack and everything are going
away 75 pounds or something crazy
so cyborg soldiers
and uh robot babies
that's all coming and you know about
musk is trying to build a city around
his own companies there in Texas
so so you'd like to have some cheap
housing that's also awesome uh below but
it would be below Market rent
for the best little city there could be
I guess
now what I didn't know is that yay is
actually talked to musk about
also building cities and as most of you
know who have been watching me for a
while that's also my my long-term
objective is to Design This City
now I don't have to own it but I'd like
to decide one
and so now you've got yay thinking about
designing cities you've got musk
thinking about designing cities you got
me thinking about designing cities and
probably lots of other people thinking
about it
here's a weird prediction
if musk designs the city the way I think
he is going to
it could end up being his biggest
business
now at the moment it's not a business at
all except for the boxable the little
temporary
buildings I think he lives in one
actually
so that part is commercial already and
he owns some of that
but I think what he's going to do this
is just my speculation
I think he's going to design one city
for his employees but he's going to do
it in a way that if it works it could
become a commercial Enterprise meaning
designing other cities and using his
boring company uh thing to board tunnels
and stuff
because remember that thing also makes
bricks
so the boring company can you know
borrow a tunnel but also uses the dirt
that's left over to press it into bricks
so I've always thought that he had the
perfect situation to you know design a
low-cost City
if he does I think given that cities are
no longer livable
would you agree with that by the way
would you agree there's cities are
basically dead there's no going back at
this point they'll just become
basically Magnus for crime and anybody
who lives there I feel sorry for him
but I think I think the biggest Market
is going to be building
brand new design cities from scratch
and I think musk is going to be the
biggest player in that even without
trying I think he'll just sort of
accidentally
you know back himself into the biggest
business in the world
because it wouldn't make sense for him
to just build the city
without also learning enough from it
that you could commercialize as a as a
project going forward
I can't imagine him just doing it as a
one-off that doesn't that just doesn't
seem very
musk-like it would be thinking too small
all right
um
I see your comments
um
you know how long I've been asking you
what's up with Soros
and a lot of you
in my audience say Soros is the devil
and he's behind all the bad things
and I keep saying but why
okay if I accept that he's behind all
the bad things because you can trace the
money back to him
but why
like why would he want America to fail
from massive unchecked crime in cities
what would be the point of that
and I felt I was all alone in that
until I saw that Elon Musk has similar
thought
so I saw a tweet from Marina medvin who
said about Zoros
Soros isn't being criticized for being
Jewish or a billionaire he's being
criticized rightly so for his investment
in a neo-leftist takeover of
prosecutions throughout the U.S he
invests around a million per district
attorney race he he does so openly
proudly even wrote about it
and then Elon Musk replied to that with
this tweet I don't understand his goal
that's exactly my opinion what
like it I'll accept
I do accept that you can trace the money
back to Soros although it goes through a
third party who makes the final decision
so you know it's an it's an indirect and
yet strong connection
if that makes sense it's indirect
because it goes to a third party but
it's a strong connection so we're not
doubting that he's funding things that
are funding district attorneys
but why do you think it's happening
he can make a trillion dollars shorting
America
do you think that 86 years old Soros is
looking to make one big killing before
he dies
that's ridiculous
that's ridiculous
the last thing that anybody 86 years old
wants to do is make a really big bet
no I don't think there's any chance of
that
so
some say for legacy some say for hate
none of those reasons check out
so you you can make
any any explanation
and they'd all sort of work a little bit
but they don't really completely work
there's no explanation to actually
completely works
hatred murder none of those none of
those make sense irrational no
no none of those make sense the there's
something terribly missing with the
hypothesis
that Soros is doing this for bad
intentions
I mean it's a bad outcome
definitely a bad outcome
it's what he's done his whole life no
he's never done this
there's no example of him doing this
there are examples of him doing things
that were bad for let's say England
that he made some money on
but again
none of it makes sense in any coherent
way when even when you explain it you're
explaining it to be as if he's crazy
you're explaining it to me as if he's
crazy which he might be
which would be which would actually be a
good explanation he's crazy
he's a True Believer in what
True Believer in what crime
none of it makes sense
now socialism doesn't have anything to
do with DA's
look but look how many look how many
different explanations you're giving
Equity destroy the country make money
the fact that there are so many
different competing explanations
is all you need to know that
there's something going on we don't know
what's going on
open borders has nothing to do with the
DA's I mean not directly
yeah I don't know
and the thing is depopulation
no it's not about depopulation
it's not about the New World Order
it's very it's something very specific
about district attorneys
but why
who in the world would want to make this
change
yeah well I'm I'm not asking you to mind
read I'm asking you to give me any
explanation that isn't crazy
which doesn't mean it's what Soros is
thinking I'm just looking for a
non-crazy explanation of why you'd be
doing it
ngos
part of a coup game plan for ideological
agenda globalism see now that's the word
salad that I'm
I know means we don't need now listen to
this I don't want to make fun of you but
this is clearly word salad
uh Soros ngos and state department use
this as part of coup game plans for
ideological agenda globalism
what does that even mean
so that's the problem is I don't even
know what those words mean
now when you say globalism
again you're missing the why
but why
yeah all right well I'm going to stop
talking about this but I it was uh
useful for me to know that there's at
least one person who's confused by it
and his name is Elon Musk so there are
two of us who are confused by it
so I thought a time time had gone by
that I could ask the medical
professionals if they're seeing a big
increase in myocarditis and sudden
deaths
what do you think happened
when I tweeted to ask doctors
specifically doctors if they're seeing a
big increase in myocarditis like Peter
baculla says
and sudden deaths what do you think the
doctor said
the answers were all over the place
of course is it's exactly what you think
uh I got very qualified people who treat
thousands of patients a year who said no
there's no difference
and then I got other people who might be
qualified saying oh yeah there's a
difference
right so
you can't even tell from
um the people in the industry so the
people who work the industry
McCullough mines the over all data
McCullough
we know uses bad data
and he does it knowingly which is the
weird part and the bad data that
McCullough uses is the the athletes that
died suddenly because that's been
researched and we know that a lot of
them are children and senior citizens
and people who died before the pandemic
and all kinds of stuff but he still uses
it
it's the most debunked database in all
the world there's nothing more debunked
than that database and he still uses it
still talks about it like is real so I
don't trust anything he says
because there's such an obvious problem
with that specific data
it's the most debunked because you can
look at the individual cases and debunk
them individually
so there are accounts that just spend
all their time debunking that database
it it is the most thoroughly debunked
fact of the whole pandemic that that
athletes did not die at a higher rate
that is absolutely something that didn't
happen
all right a lot of you are really mad
and say not debunked interview them what
good would that do
what good would it do to interview
it would do no good at all
so yeah I mean we we're still lost in
that model that if you talk to one
person you can know something you can't
that model doesn't work ever
talking to one person gets you one
person's opinion
it's no value whatsoever
all right so I guess that's an open
question
it always will be I suppose
um there's something weird happening
with Matt taibi and Elon Musk and sub
stack
I'll just tell you the sequence of
events but I don't know exactly what's
going on here it's a little weird
so Matt Tybee tweeted he said of all
things I learned earlier today that sub
stack now that's where people can write
blog posts and get paid for it with
subscription members
I learned earlier today that sub stack
links were being blocked on this
platform meaning Twitter
when I asked why I was told it's a
dispute over the new sub stack notes
platform now substack is adding a
feature called notes
where people can basically post things
like tweeting
and there's some thought that Twitter
might you see that as competition and
might want to suppress it
so that was Matt taibi's claim and he
said he talked to somebody who must have
known something but Elon Musk push back
on that he said number one
sub stack links were never blocked
math statement is false then he said
number two
sub stack was trying to download a
massive portion of the Twitter database
to bootstrap their Twitter clone in
other words they were trying to suck
data out of Twitter's API
to get enough data that they could clone
or match Twitter's tweeting service
so their IP address is obviously
untrusted
so it's an untrusted site because they
tried to do things according to musk
that the API privileges should not allow
I don't know if there's a rule against
it but he doesn't like it
and then Elon says turns out Matt is or
was an employee of substack
now here's the fun part
twitters context notes
called out Musk
on a fact check
so Twitter fact check it fact checked
its boss
and they fact check them hard it wasn't
it wasn't it wasn't polite
they fact checked them hard here's what
the the now that doesn't mean the
contacts notes are right right because
the context notes are a consensus of
people who do these notes doesn't mean
they're right but they have a different
opinion
and it says uh substack no substack
links have been throttled on Twitter
so that would be different than being
blocked but throttled so there may be
some difference between blocked and
throttled
throttled might be true whereas block
does not okay
um
and sub Stack's Twitter account has been
restricted it says it also says mataibi
is not a sub stack employee
he writes a newsletter there and the CEO
of sub stack says
that he's never better to play
so what does that mean
here's what I think it means
here's what I think
I don't believe that mad TYB ever got a
paycheck from
or was technically ever an employee of
substack
I do believe
that sub stack uses their high profile
users
to promote the system
I do believe it's possible that Matt
tahibi got a maybe a sweetheart deal to
move his business onto substack
and if you got a sweet deal in return
for maybe promoting the service or being
there it's a little bit of an
arrangement more than just a customer
so if musk is speaking um
let's say a hyperbolically
that he's an employee but sort of
employee in quotes meaning that they're
working together for a mutual benefit
it might not be a hundred percent
completely false
but it is useful to know he's not you
know a W-2 employee at least but I do
think that probably the big names as sub
stack have some kind of uh understanding
for Mutual benefit
I'm sure
and of course Matt uh in protest I
believe he's going to stop tweeting
and just use a sub stack
which
is more than most point actually
yeah that's more to his point
so I don't know what's true here but I
think this is a fascinating story just
to watch them try to fight it out there
all right
um I have one other point I'd like to
make
I've been using on my phone the Google
search engine
and
you all know what that looks like
and the Google search engine also
surfaces you know stories
news stories
and I'm fascinated because I noticed
that if I look at
um
if I look at CNN
and then I look at Fox News
I used to think I got all the big
stories but now I feel like both Fox
News and CNN just completely ignore
major stories
and I don't even know that they are
stories until I see them somewhere else
such as
on the Google page they do a different
job of curating stuff
uh
Easter Sunday yeah it's not so much on
Easter but they sometimes the news is
just so different
uh
open ai's first physical robot shocks
the industry now here's a story that's
not on CNN or or Fox News I didn't see
it anyway
but open AI has a physical robot
that's
um that's really big news isn't it
don't you think if if AI actually is now
in a robot
that's maybe some of the biggest news in
the history of oh I don't know
civilization
but here it is it's on at least Google
found it
um what else is it finding
um mastering mid-journey Google and
Amazon struggle to lay off workers in
Europe well who cares
new battery Tech could extend EV ranges
by 10 times
now I love those stories let's find out
uh new
researchers from pohang University and
so gang University
um developed a polymeric binder for a
stable reliable high capacity anode
material
rather than conventional anodes made of
graphite or other materials you don't
want any of that conventional graphite
stuff
all right well we'll see if you can make
batteries 10 times more powerful
and I think all this green stuff is
going to work out after all do we need
some kind of a battery law
uh
like uh was it uh
what was the law of microchips that they
would double every 18 months or
something
speed would double
what was the name of that that was the
uh Moore's Law
we need a Moore's law for batteries
because it does seem like batteries are
not they're not doubling but I feel like
batteries are Maybe
20 better every year
does that sound right
maybe 20 batteries the batteries are
about 20 percent better every year which
is gigantic
that's gigantic
you don't think it's 20 I think lately
that
the gains have been more impressive
because we could actually fly airplanes
on batteries now
that's something you couldn't do five
years ago
20 more expensive all right well maybe
we'll see some of these 10 10x
things come through
now how many of you are watching this
live stream because there's absolutely
nothing else worth watching because it's
Easter and you're kind of tired of
watching churchy stuff there's just
nothing else to do right it's just me or
nothing
so it's a lot of pressure on me you're
watching golf
or me
well does anybody have any questions
because there's no real news today
you guys should set my own good for you
battery prices are going down
all right you just watch me every
morning so oh the Masters are today
there's a David from comment about what
about me
uh any more I can share about this
simulation
I usually share all my simulation
stories as soon as I get them
uh
underrated where would you like to build
a city
I like to build it where there's the
least amount of weather or natural
disasters
because I think you could build a city
off-grid now that's pretty far off grid
for example you could build a city where
there's say one Highway one super
highway to it
but that super highway let's say it's
from a big airport but that super
highway is only self-driving cars
think about it if you had only
self-driving cars
on the highway
you wouldn't need a speed limit
and there would be no traffic congestion
because if they're self-driving they
just adjust to all situations you would
so you'd never have traffic you'd be
able to travel let's say 140 miles per
hour
and you just walk out to the curb with
your baggage throw it in the back of a
self-driving car and your boom in the
middle of the city
that's what I think is going to happen
yeah there'll be some drones but those
will be a little more expensive
uh
werewolves and vampires
there's something pandering to the
conservative here's a good question
Scott since your cancellation if you
started pandering to the conservative
Winger of your audience well let me ask
you
let me ask you am I pandering more
let's say more to the right wing of my
audience
what do you say I see mostly knows on
locals
see mostly those
now but
we would agree that everybody's biased
right including me so I'm not without
bias and let me explain my bias
when I was younger I was
probably more identified with Democrats
in terms of their social stuff but a lot
of it was about privacy
and you know just leave me alone
and now I think uh now I think that the
Republicans are more of the Free Speech
leave me alone party
so I've always been Free Speech leave me
alone it's just that the party changed
they reversed so I'm kind of the same
but I'm now more compatible with right
leading philosophy because the woke
stuff is absolute complete
so you can't there's no way I can
support all the woke stuff
so if it looks like I'm more right-wing
in the in the context of the woke stuff
going crazy that's probably true
that's probably true
all right here's an example of me not
being more right-wing you ready for this
I saw actor Brian Cranston explained
something to me that for some reason
I had missed
and that was his point his point was
that that uh white people mostly have a
blind spot
for the phrase make America great again
and his point was if you're black when
was America great
and I wanted I immediately wanted to
argue I was like well
yeah my first thought was well come on
you know America was certainly great in
the 60s right
but if you're black
maybe that was not such a great time
you know what I mean
and so I actually agree with that point
but I'd never heard it expressed that
way and the reason is when I hear make
America great again
I don't think so much domestically
or I don't think so much about
individuals do you I don't think so much
about the specific people I think about
the country as it would be seen from
another country when what I hear make
America great again I think oh people in
France will say that's a great country
or people in China will say well they
might be our Rivals but man they do
things right over there it's a strong
country
so
what I when I hear make America great
again
which by the way I've never embraced you
know that right you know that I've never
embraced that slogan make America great
again I've talked about it and I've
talked about it being one of the
strongest campaign slogans of all time
but I don't use it you know I don't wear
the hat I don't I don't use the hashtag
and it's because it always bothered me a
little bit
I wasn't sure what it was
and it probably wasn't this but this is
a good enough reason I I think that's a
good point
I think that if you're trying to make a
slogan that fits everybody
and you're a black American and you said
wait a minute
what what exactly is the year that
you're going back to that was so great
when my people were worse off than they
are now
that's a pretty good question
now does that feel like I'm pandering to
the right
because I just told people on the right
that make America great again is a kind
of a problem
no I I think that I don't have any
problem criticizing people on the right
and I just got done talking about the
Soros thing making no sense to me
so even just today I've criticized the
Soros theory that comes from the right
make America great again you know the
most famous thing from the right
but I'm also solidly
philosophically more aligned with
conservatives
at least on the woke stuff
you know not on religion because I'm not
a believer
and on and you know my opinion on
abortion is that women should figure it
out let us know
so I'm way left of uh
the conservatives on that
I'm left of the Liberals on that
foreign
build back better yeah build back better
at least allows that the future will be
better than the past and I also think
make America great again is a little
backwards think backwards looking
like I don't want to be great like we
used to be great
do you
I want to be great in the new way that
makes sense for the you know the future
I want to be great in the future I don't
want to be great like the past that's
not a goal for me
um
what is Brian Cranston done for poor
black folks is that a fair question
pays taxes
Brian Cranston probably pays a lot of
taxes
where does that go to
a lot of it goes to poor people
of all colors so Brian Cranston has done
way more than you've done for black
people
fact assuming you pay his taxes because
he has an enormous income
he probably pays oh let's say he was
making 10 million dollars a year he was
probably paying 5 million dollars a year
in taxes what has he done for black
people he paid five million dollars a
year in taxes probably something like
that probably
that's a lot
that's a lot
all right
um
what if somebody says what are black
people done for you are you kidding
have you noticed anything about sports
or music or fashion or comedy
yeah I was in a spaces
conversation with mostly black members
and
they they challenged me to say you know
what would America look like
without
um without the black influence
you know would would it be as good and I
was like try to imagine American Sports
fashion music
entertainment
just try to imagine America without the
influence of Black America yeah even
Rock wouldn't exist right because even
even our popular music came from you
know the blues Etc
so no you can't even imagine America
would be
it would look like Great Britain
the the best things about America are
that you can come over here and uh even
though there's a bunch of white people
you can still get good food
that's probably one of the best things
about America is you have you have
enough diversity that if you need some
Thai food well you can get some Thai
food
if you need some Indian food so you can
have some flavor for once you can get
some Indian food
yeah
yeah I like that now crime of course is
a big issue of not ignoring it but you
you can't you can't say that you know
black people in America didn't make
America a better place in a whole bunch
of areas that's just obvious
but there are other areas where crime in
particular where that's that's a pretty
big challenge
all right
uh is Ben Carson in the news
I don't know
so what is the net benefit
is that the way to do it
should you do a nap benefit that feels
just
super racist
[Laughter]
why would you even want to do a net a
net benefit calculation for black people
in America unless you're racist like
what were the possible benefit of that
be
there's nothing you could do with that
except be racist
it'd be funny somebody says you could
never calculate it we'd never agree on
what's what are the ins and what are the
outs
all right
do you believe do you believe that I'm
uh I'm being dishonest to avoid
cancellation
I see some accusations coming over do
you believe that I'm uh I'm
intentionally being more woke than I
normally would be
a lot of people say yes
I I think that maybe if you had watched
me for a longer period of time that that
opinion would be revised
because I have a very long history
of being left of Bernie on social stuff
I've been saying it for five years that
I'm left of Bernie so if I pull out
something that sounds left to Bernie
that's not new
that's who I've been the whole time in
public life
56 degrees in Minneapolis will help out
that
am I a Libertarian now
i i as soon as I label myself
I'm less useful
the the moment you say I am one of these
you're you're just less useful to
everybody the moment you label yourself
what do I think motivates Soros
I'll give you my best hypothesis
my hypothesis is that he's not in
control of his own money anymore
because if he wanted something specific
he would tell you in direct language
he would say I'm trying to accomplish X
so I'm giving money to make that happen
and he doesn't
it sounds like he gives money to
groups say he thinks makes him look good
oh I'll give my money to What's called
the color of change
because they do a bunch of progressive
things
and then what they do with the money
I think is where the problem is so I
think the problem is that the people who
gives money to do bad things with the
money and he doesn't have full control
of that and maybe isn't too happy about
it and maybe doesn't even know about it
you know maybe he's just not fully there
so I think there's a
I think there's a competence problem
his confidence I think there's a
communication problem that he doesn't
know exactly where his money's going and
for why
and he's probably just trying to make
the best of it with his limited mental
capacity and his limited Vision about
where the money's going
and maybe he doesn't even care I mean
maybe he's just so old he doesn't even
care at this point
um Warren Buffett has the same problem
could be
yeah if you have if you have a lot of
money it's really a problem to give it
to Charities because it can distort the
charity first of all if you give a
charity too much money suddenly they're
gonna you know find reasons to spend it
um
so there's probably no right answer if
you're going to give a massive amount of
money to charity you're going to give it
to some bad people
all right
um
you only donate to the Gates Foundation
well a lot of people think Bill Gates is
the devil all right what do you think
who is worse Bill Gates or George Soros
according to you
according to you not according to me
because I
I think Gates is not trying to hurt
anybody
I think he's trying to help period
Soros I just don't understand that's
just like a black box to me it's just a
mystery
yeah
uh
Erica I will change your mind
so the thing with Soros and Gates
is that
I'm not going to argue whether he did
some things that worked out
bad for the world
that's a separate conversation the only
conversation I'd have is what is their
motivation
why is it that they do what they do and
I I do not believe that either person is
motivated by evil
I don't believe that there's something
going on that we don't understand
with sorrows but it doesn't look like
it's just some kind of satanic evil
take over the world kind of thing it
doesn't look like it I don't know what
it is
yeah I don't think it has to do with
being Jewish I don't think it has to do
with being I don't know what it is
I don't think it's money
I really don't think it's money
those of you who have never been Rich
you need to take my word for it
if you're 86 and you've been Rich for
most of your adult life you're just not
you're not fighting for money at 86
that's just not happening I mean I'm
I'm uh what 30 years younger than Soros
and I've already stopped being primarily
motivated by money
I mean I'm motivated in the sense that
you know more money gives you more
influence and stuff like that but I'm
kind of over it as my primary motivation
where it used to be it used to be trying
to make as much money as I can when I
was young
but I don't believe it no I I think
oops
oh
well
looks like we've completely lost our
signal here on
the locals platform
uh uh for reasons that aren't clear
uh
that's weird oh I know what's going on
let's yeah that doesn't make sense
all right well I'm gonna have to
fix that later
but uh
I'm glad you're here at least
that was my problem that was my device
uh ran out of juice
you've merged
uh namely the what
if I will use a sensory to oppose
transhumanism it would have Zero Effect
the local seems buggy that was that was
on my end my device
um was that in power
naming the what
read the Bible about the resurrection I
probably won't do that
well locals has a lot more content than
you have anywhere else so it's the only
place you can get the Dilbert comic by
the way since I have you here on YouTube
it would help me out if you subscribed
so there's a subscribe button on there
so if you hit that button
that would be good for me if you'd like
to do that
uh oh locals is down
is locals down or is it just I'm down
what does name the noses mean if I say
it again I'm going to block you
is that a racist thing
his name the nose is some kind of racist
thing
I'm not depressed
how much do you make on YouTube uh it's
private but it's not much
it's not a big percentage of anything
all right locals is down you say
but is it a coincidence that locals is
down at the same time that might well
locals is not down
and a back
so I'm back on my phone
all right people
I use my phone to sign back on but I'm
just about done
so
um don't get too excited
my iPad ran out of power
user error
all right
I don't want you to have to look at this
angle because it's a terrible angle
it was horrible without me I know yeah
no it's my fault battery Soros got my
battery
George Soros made my battery drain
I think that's what he's up to
all right YouTube I'm gonna see you
tomorrow
thanks for joining bye for now
