hey everybody
come on in come on in it's time
for coffee with scott adams that's right
best part of the day and you found it
again
think of all the people who wish they
were here
but they're doing something far less
interesting
and stimulating don't we feel sorry for
them
just a little bit and they're also going
to miss
a little thing called the simultaneous
sip because they may not be prepared
with
a copper mug of glass attacker
challenges die in a canteen flask
a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the
unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
well i don't like to brag you know
because
i live in california and there's a lot
to brag about
for example today the air is actually
breathable um again i don't like to brag
but i'll be able to walk outside my home
today
open up my mouth and breathe in the air
without risking a serious medical
problem
yeah in my town the smoke has actually
subsided to the point where
i can go outside so look at me
try to hold your jealousy
um there's a new turn in the uh the
president trump's
medical situation i don't know if you've
heard this but he's exhibiting a new
side effect
i don't know if this is a side effect
from the
the meds or it's something that the
coronavirus does
but apparently he can only tweet in all
caps
um i don't know exactly what the
treatment for that is
you know sometimes people will send one
tweet in all caps is kind of a
way to emphasize a specific tweet
and that's okay that's not necessarily a
sign of any kind of illness or side
effect
but if you tweet a whole series of
tweets
the same morning and they're all in all
caps
that's that's time for some serious
medical intervention
and so i think president trump needs a
little more
a little more attention otherwise
we're going to be treated to all caps
tweets from now on
and it's worse than that it's worse than
that because
as you know the president took a little
drive yesterday
and he wanted to just wave to the
supporters who were gathered around
walter reed hospital
but because he's still infected
he was in the car with two secret
service agents and now people are
concerned
that those secret service agents could
in the worst case scenario they might
start tweeting in all caps as well
because we don't know what it is about
the president that's causing him to
tweet in all caps
but i don't think it's the sort of thing
you want to expose other people to
because the secret service people are
just trying to do their jobs
and you know what it what if they have
to go through life
tweeting in all caps because of this
exposure to whatever this is
that's not fair is it no it's not fair
at all
so i think we should be concerned about
that
now some people are saying it's
very very uh inappropriate for the
president
to put the secret service at risk
now i did hear an ex-white house
physician talking about this and he he
determined that the risk was
very very small tiny tiny tiny little
risk
and apparently the doctors at walter
reed the ones that are treating the
president
uh cleared him to do this so they too
judged that the risk to the secret
service agents and to anybody else
was very very very small very very very
but it wasn't zero it wasn't
zero so was it worth it
was it a good risk management decision
by the president well
one of the things it does is that it
reminds the public that the president
is relatively uh good shape
and probably recovering on schedule and
the country will go ahead and probably
the stock market will
will open a little bit higher today i
don't know if it has but
there's a good chance it will because
the president's looking
uh robust so i would say
the trade-off is this a tiny tiny little
chance
that the secret service could be
infected
versus the benefit of showing the public
that he's alive
somebody just asked me what city should
i move to to be successful
not san francisco don't come here
not los angeles i would rule out
baltimore
chicago new york city
um austin maybe i'm hearing good things
about austin
maybe some place in texas uh hearing
good things about nashville
so that was just a question about where
to move for success
all right now here's a question if the
secret service agents who drove the
president around
in this little uh one block drive there
if if they were put at risk what about
the doctors
why why do we ignore the fact that there
apparently there's a an army of doctors
i don't know how many of them
looks like a lot of them but there must
be
probably 15 people who have daily access
to the president
now they're also wearing protective gear
but so are the so are the secret service
agents
shouldn't each of those medical people
have to go into a 14-day
quarantine every time they talk to the
president
i mean i suppose you have to treat the
medical community differently
but i only point this out to say
we're really bad at estimating a risk
because we've got this team of people
going in and out and dealing with
probably other coronavirus patients
and then going in and out and dealing
with other diseases
and then going in and out of the
president's room
there is a lot of leakage i also would
like to point out
that the average person
the average person doesn't do that good
a job
with social distancing and math squaring
yeah if people are watching if people
are watching you're probably pretty good
with your mask
if there are people around you're
probably good with your social
distancing
what happens when you're home does
anybody come in your home without a mask
is there anybody anybody who comes in
and out of your home
then maybe goes in and out of other
homes
i've got a feeling that if you drilled
down and found out what was happening
behind
closed doors that the social distancing
is not nearly as good as you would hope
not nearly as good it doesn't have to be
perfect
just has to be pretty good all right um
i understand that there are some kind of
basketball playoffs
happening i have reached an
a new all-time low in caring about
sports
for all the right reasons sports never
really needed to be important did they
you know what what whole was it the
sports we're filling
i think the hole that sports fills other
than taking up some time
is that it allows you to have a team
that you can root for
but i feel as if we're all already on
teams
because of politics it feels like you're
on a team
then some people are joining anti-fun
and black lives matter
i feel as if the purpose of sports
is much less because sports in a way you
could argue
is like this symbolic kind of a fight
you know this big symbolic battle so
that your need for a real battle
is somewhat siphoned off by your
enjoyment of
entertainment in these fake battles
called sports
but if you see fake battles every day
and you feel like you're on one of those
team
or rooting for them maybe you don't need
sports as much
maybe you don't
um did you notice how little news there
is today
that the biggest news is the infiniti
infinitivally small risk
that two secret service agents who sign
up to risk their lives for the president
and for the for the nation i would say
even more than the president
that there there's slight risk to these
two people because the president drove
around the block
that's it all the other news in the
world just sort of stopped
what does that tell you about the
subjectivity
of your news consuming experience
because this happens on holidays and
weekends
whenever the people who make the news
take some time off
there's no news so if you think that
your
understanding of the world and what's
important is driven by what's actually
happening
it's not it's not at all um
it's it's really entirely because
people make up the news they they decide
what's important
they transmit it to you and then they
assign your opinions
and then you get worked up over the
opinion that somebody else is assigned
to you
and if you don't think that's what's
happening just pay attention
and and you'll notice these little these
little suggestions
that that's what's happening and you're
seeing it right now as soon as president
trump
uh can't be attacked as easily because
he's
sick so you don't want to attack sick
people as much
it just makes all the news go away it's
like nothing is important suddenly
but is that the case did did the world
change no the world didn't change at all
but the way you process the world
completely changed
because the people who were assigning
you opinions stopped doing it for a
couple days
they just stopped assigning you opinions
and they're giving you dumb ones like
you know the president driving around in
a car and you know
it's a real thing but in terms of the
global things that you're worrying about
pretty small today i got a little back
and forth with a twitter troll
who tells me that president trump has no
empathy
he has no empathy to which i
quite naturally responded that mind
reading is not a thing
can you really tell if an if a stranger
has
empathy well the troll got back to me
and said quite reasonably quite
reasonably said you can tell empathy
by people's actions now that's not
100 true because our actions don't
always correspond to our inner thoughts
we might be concealing our inner
thoughts for any variety of reasons
either to look strong or
whatever but you can conceal your
your your true inner thoughts but i
thought well
but let me consider this accusation
accusation that president trump
has not acted in a way that would
demonstrate
empathy what do you think of that
do you think that the president has so
far in
in his uh let's say campaign for and
then
first term as he demonstrated
through his actions not just his words
but his actions
empathy
well i would say he based his entire
campaign on
it didn't he correct me if i'm wrong
but wasn't the central message of his
campaign
empathy for the middle class americans
who had been forgotten
that was not just an add-on
that wasn't something he said you know i
got my campaign platform and
it probably sounds good i'll throw in
some stuff about the middle class
no it started there
the entire heart of his entire movement
started with an empathy core and then
built on top of that
it's all built around the middle class
and the empathy for them because if you
get that part right
everything else works you know it's it's
a
general truism that if the middle class
is healthy
you have a much better chance of helping
everybody else right
you know the the rich are going to be
fine if the middle class are good
and the poor are in much better shape if
the middle class are healthy they don't
need help they can provide help
so and of course the president has been
very direct
more direct than anybody's ever been by
saying that his empathy is for americans
and he's going to keep it that way
because he cares the most about the
people who are closest
which is the most human thing you could
do because
empathy you can think of it as something
that's like the center of a bullseye
you know a person's primary empathy is
to themselves
even if you think you're a good person
we're designed
to to take care of ourselves first but
then there's your family your loved ones
your
you know your extended family your
co-workers your
your local town then your state your
country in the world
and the empathy that you have if you're
a normal human
is the greatest the closer you are to
the center of your core
more empathy for your family than for
strangers etc right
so the president has said you know his
empathy stake in the ground is the
middle class
it's a pretty big big group of people
so um i've noticed that
and maybe this is an exaggeration but it
seems like i can tell somebody's
political
affiliation online by whether they
criticize
systems or people
when you see conservatives criticizing
stuff
you know of course both sides criticize
people so i'm not i'm not saying that's
exclusive to the left but you will more
often see
conservatives talking about free markets
and the system capitalism the system
socialism the system how many people on
the supreme court
a system um yeah the separation of power
is a system
so mostly
systems they do also talk about people
because it's
you know that's the game we're in but if
i feel as though
conservatives have a feeling about
people
and then they'll throw in a little bit
about systems if they need to
seems like a big difference and i'm i'm
watching for that
i i saw somebody in the comments refer
to the president
as a con man
and i've often thought that that's the
lowest
level of analysis because the lowest
level of analysis is simply
substituting a word for other words
because there's no actual analysis there
all you did is put a feeling
on an observation which is sort of
nothing
it adds nothing so what would be the
difference between a salesperson
and a con man what would be the
difference
well the difference would be whether
they're doing something for good or for
bad
is the president trying to help the
middle class trying to help the united
states
trying to make this you know the economy
good yeah
yeah obviously he can't he can't do
anything good for himself
unless he's doing things that are good
for the country
his job is so transparent that would be
impossible to be a
to be a bad president and then have a
good outcome for himself that's not even
a thing
nobody would even think that way it's
too it's too obvious that you're
connected
so seems to me the president is uh
so hard to read all these comments and
think at the same time
or somebody saying that that was up 300
so that would
suggest that the country likes what the
president does
because his health is probably what's
driving the
market right now so it looks like the
stock market thinks they want more
president trump
all right so i made a list
of uh i made a list of the
attacks that i get on twitter and i
think i'll just paste
i just paste this list to my trolls from
now on
so here's the list of every criticism i
get on twitter you're going to recognize
these right
all right so what i was saying about a
con man versus a salesperson
because i forgot my train of thought
there going back to it
the difference is what do you think is
the intention
and if you're going to imply imply an
intention on a stranger
and you can't read minds it's just sort
of useless crazy talk
right you can like what somebody's doing
but you can't
then go back into their head and find
out that they're really doing it for bad
reasons
you know that's kind of not a thing you
can't read minds
um and then they're the people who say
he's a grifter or he's a narcissist or
he's
whatever you want to call him the the
this is what i call
word thinking so instead of saying what
is it we want to be done
and then does he do those things which
is sort of all that matters
right for the president what are what
are the things you want
accomplished is that a president who can
do those things
have they demonstrated the ability or a
track record to do those things
that's what matters but if you just want
to put a different word on it
i would like to refer to his
salesmanship as
con man what if you added
what what was your what was your
contribution to the conversation
you just changed the word that's it
um so word thinking is not useful all
right so here are the list of
the six things that capture almost every
criticism i get on
on twitter number one a personal attack
instead of any kind of argument
mind reading failures where they imagine
i'm thinking something i'm not
goofy hallucinations of my opinions
where they just
imagine some straw man opinion and
attack it you've all had that
sarcasm unconnected to reality just a
pure sarcastic tweet
with no with no complaint about the
facts or the reasoning just sarcasm
uh strong opinions based on fake news
you'll get that one a lot somebody has a
real strong opinion because they think
that the president
once suggested uh injecting bleach into
your arm
never happened but they have a strong
opinion on that
failure to compare the right things
which would be
comparing the united states to other
countries
in the coronavirus that would be one
example and the illusion of
understanding science
we're all guilty of that i think every
one of us is guilty of this flaw
of imagining that we understand science
and the person we're talking to doesn't
understand science
probably not the case we're all pretty
sure that we've got the right
view of science the way i like to look
at it is
trusting science makes complete sense
is there anybody here who doesn't think
you should trust
science now when i say science i mean
the
the process of science it's pretty good
right
the process for finding truth
yeah and the process
is pretty good here's what i don't trust
scientists because scientists
are people i don't totally trust people
people lie people are biased people have
cognitive dissonance
there's nothing you can trust less
than a person people are terrible
but science
described as the process of science and
and the things that
scientists do that's great i'm all in on
science but scientists
sometimes good sometimes bad
but they're no more reliable than people
in general and
people in general are terribly
unreliable for any variety of reasons so
i'm going to start pasting this list of
six things
and just putting a number on it oh
i just realized that
i've got two number fives in my list
damn it i have to go rewrite that
um and i actually can't remember the
last time
somebody disagreed with me in public who
also
understood what my point was
and understood let's say economics
so so here's a uh here's a bold
statement
i'm not aware of any time in my adult
life
that anyone has disagreed with me
who understood economics on any level
you know don't have to be an expert or a
nobel prize-winning economist
but just understand economics and how
decisions are made
and also understood my opinion
lots of people imagine they're
disagreeing with me but they're always
disagreeing with some phantom opinion
that's their just their imagination
somebody says i'll take that challenge
okay
um
you should skip number two on purpose
all right so
would you all agree that there's not
much news happening today that's not my
imagination is it
um greg asks do i think that trump would
do as well
if the media was fair to him
that's a good question one of the things
that trump has going for them
for him is that the media
is sort of set up as his grand nemesis
and there's something useful about that
having a real
clean nemesis that other people can get
behind
hating that could actually help you out
so i've got a feeling that trump's uh
set up of being against the media is
really helping them
somebody says scott thinks tariffs are
good and therefore i don't understand
economics well whoever said that
obviously
doesn't understand economics tariffs
are bad unless you're using them as part
of a trade war
if what you're doing is trying to punish
another country
as part of your negotiations and it's
part of a trade war
then a tariff can be a good thing
meaning that it
creates pain in a way that can get you
to the end of your negotiations
permanent tariffs probably be better off
without them
countries use them to protect their
local industries
and yes i do understand that the tariffs
are not paid
by the other country so
nice try but it didn't work
uh yeah when there's no news buckle your
seat belts
somebody says i'm going to look at some
of your comments here and see what
what you guys are thinking because there
really isn't much happening
and you know there's something coming oh
there is something coming
but it could be that that all of the
news is going to center around the
president
getting out of the uh out of walter reed
early
now i think you know what's going on
with the
the mixed messages you know there was uh
i guess mark meadows said something
about there was
great concern about the president but
then the president is trying to
paint a picture where he is in good
shape
so which is it was there great concern
for the president's
of vital signs was it touch and go was
it dangerous
or was it no problem i'm gonna get over
this everything's going fine we're all
recovered
which one would help the president more
which of those two versions of reality
is better the one where everything's
fine and he's getting through this great
or the one where it really was pretty
bad but
looks like he'll make it i would argue
that
some some mash-up of the two
is best because it does help the
president
to think he was in real trouble because
that gives them the maximum empathy
but at the same time it helps the
country to think that the president
is unusually good at recovering
because it makes him feel it makes it
look like a little bit of a
you know a super superman kind of
situation it's like well
he sure got over that pretty quickly so
i think the president's
best case scenario is that when he's
talking he minimizes it
but when other people are talking they
don't minimize it as much
so it sounds scary when you're hearing
other people but when the president
talks about it himself
he just says he did great got through it
boom
i think that's the perfect place to be
this is one of those cases where being
on the same page
is not nearly as good as having a
variety of opinions because that
i think that's going to serve him best
um
simone sanders was acting squirrely on
jake tapper on the topic of biden
being exposed well he's been tested
enough i think we know
at this point um yeah then there's a
question
of whether trump knowingly spread
the virus my guess is that that didn't
happen
and that if we ever figure out what what
really happened when
we would find out that it didn't so
that's the sort of thing where unless
you get proof that that happened
i wouldn't worry about the rumor that it
might have
uh stagecraft is the new statecraft
yeah well it always has been stagecraft
is super important
how would you like to be joe biden right
now and know that nothing you say
matters
as long as the president is in walter
reed and really even after he comes back
it's still going to be the story nothing
nothing that joe biden says or does
makes any difference as long as trump is
absorbing
all of the energy out of everything
all right um one of the questions that
people are asking is
whether he's having any kind of side
effects
from the meds it was my understanding
that if things get bad
they'll use steroids right but
can somebody who knows more than i do
tell me is there anything the
president's getting
that would be a steroid or anything that
he's getting
they would have any chance of changing
his decision making
now you those of you have been watching
me on periscope for a while you know
that
in the past year i went through several
bouts of
taking prednisone and as i described to
you during the process
taking prednisone changes your
personality
and it's really obvious you know when
when you're on it you're
you become you know sort of a super
person
and your uh enthusiasm
and your optimism and your energy are
high but
on the downside you can get pretty
aggressive
and for people who are already
aggressive
you don't want to give somebody who's
already aggressive
a little extra you know chemical
aggression
so i would worry about that if trump had
anything in that family but i don't
i don't necessarily think he is
if it were me i'd worry about it
oh yeah there's a story about 60 minutes
ted cruz was calling this out
60 minutes i guess is doing a story
about tara reid the accuser of
you know joe biden's accuser of sexual
assault and
he's being asked so ted cruz is asking
60 minutes publicly
why they would run that story in
australia but they don't run it in the
united states
it's 60 minutes and it's a and it's a
u.s
story it's not like a some australian
specific story
it's a u.s specific story so why is a
u.s
specific story that's bad for biden
only showing in australia
that's a good question isn't it
and so i hear these on that dexa method
zone
uh somebody says it's a powerful steroid
i just looked it up and it didn't say
steroid
um let me see this
question if you were present how would
you handle the 3 000 refugees being sent
to the u.s
for added chaos yes so
i guess i guess the refugee situation is
being handled by just asking the mexican
government to take care of it
that i guess i would do it the same way
you want mexico to handle
that um
somebody says that steroids make you
aggressive if you're male
maybe i would think it would make
anybody aggressive but maybe
who knows
yes i'm saying you say australia's 60
minutes there's a little bit of a lag
here
will will trump having coveted help him
or hurt him
um it's a little bit hard to
uh to know if i had if i had to put
money on it
i would say it will help him because
it's gonna it's gonna create the uh
it will create the impression that he
understands it
like you could only understand it if
you've been through it
it is simply true that you'd rather have
somebody who has experience in the very
thing that you're trying to manage
in every category it's going to be it's
going to be an advantage to have some
experience
so trump just learned a whole lot about
coronavirus
probably that he didn't know before and
he also has
a you know and sort of an appreciation
for
how it feels like you know the the
actual mental psychological
part of it uh and even with his
superior health care he probably has
some good idea what's
you know what the what anybody would
feel going through that
situation especially if they're older so
i feel like it's going to help him
but you could certainly make an argument
that it would go the other way
uh why did you upload youtube have so
many ads
well you should uh i think i changed the
ad
setting on youtube so you should not see
the interstitial ads anymore
unless i said it wrong i heard a
complaint on that and i changed that
yesterday
so that should have changed
um
all right somebody say says that
dexamethasone is stronger than
prednisone
[Music]
um i don't know you know when i looked
it up it did say that there was a rare
a rare possibility of mood change
but it looked like it was pretty rare
my mother took prednisone and she became
an aggressive house cleaner
yeah you can get a lot done it's really
a dangerous drug that way
um yeah if you
if you're not paying for the prime
version of
youtube that gets rid of the ads you
really ought to i
personally i found that youtube is
probably my favorite form
of uh entertainment now
because you can get these little shorty
hits of things
if i try to watch a movie on regular tv
like on cable the time it takes me to
search for a movie
on my slow slow interface on my tv
and find a movie and then i've got to
wait for the opening credits
i'm sort of 15 minutes into a project
that i only wanted to spend 10 minutes
on
but if i go to youtube i can just click
some interesting 10 minute video and i'm
happy
what percent of your followers have had
to refollow you at least once i don't
know percentage but it's
certainly thousands
let's see that comment i missed uh
sin opinions are assigned do you believe
that you also assign
opinions to your viewers to a certain
extent that's a good question
somebody asked do i think that i assign
that i personally have assigned opinions
to my viewers
um yes yes i would say so
based on feedback so there are quite a
few people who
are right to me on a regular basis and
say that the way they see the world is
changed
because of something i said so i would
say that the feedback
is yes now what i try to do is not
assign
opinions so much as a sign technique
so what i'm trying to do is tell you the
way to frame something
the way to think of it the way to change
the way you frame it the way you compare
it to the right things
so i'm trying to give you tools which
would allow you to
you know not have to have opinions
assigned to you
but in the process of that i'm sure i
assign opinions whether i want to or not
all right um
yeah there's people claiming uh somebody
said in the comments
that trump is only hoaxing having
coronavirus i i think you just have to
look at the number of people involved to
know that it's not a hoax
you know nobody would plan a hoax that
would end your political career
and you would have this many witnesses i
mean there are a lot of doctors and
nurses and
spouses of doctors and you know there's
just way too many witnesses
so one thing i feel confident in saying
it's not a hoax
all right um
i'm seeing people uh agree that i have
changed their opinions
somebody says how's the little wife
so uh christina is taking uh
aerobatic flying lessons in fact
she might actually be in the air right
now so while i'm doing these periscopes
and
and during the day somewhere you know
somewhere up in the air up there
not directly above the populated parts
uh christina's doing barrel rolls and uh
you know she's doing any number of
hammerheads and
things that i don't have words for
so she's she's doing very scary stuff
imagine being
this is what she does every day so every
day she'll be in an
airplane she's very close to getting her
her pilot lesson but she's pilot license
but she's taking lessons in
aerobic flying aerobatic flying and
imagine doing this in an airplane going
straight up
stalling it and letting the plane just
free fall down to earth and then try to
recover it
because that's what you do that's you
know that's part of the fun
is try to recover the plane when it's
free falling with the engine off
she does that every day it's crazy
all right um vice presidential debates
you know i say this a lot about mike
pence
mike pence has just got to be one of the
most solid
dependable vice presidents of all time
now i don't i wouldn't choose him for
president
but i love
how complementary he is to the president
and i love that he's so dependable he
just doesn't make mistakes
and if they do they're they're trivial
ones right so
the fact that uh pence who's just the
most solid solid
politician is going to go out there
against
kamala it's pretty interesting i have to
admit
this will be the most interesting vice
presidential debate
so you've got a guy who doesn't make
mistakes
against somebody who's needs to mix it
up a little bit
i feel like kamala harris needs to do
more than play for a draw
i think she needs to play for a win and
you know pence can play for play for a
tie
because if he gets a tie he wins because
pence just needs to make it not about
him
right yeah he just wants don't don't
vote based on me
just yeah i'll just play for a tie
not cause any trouble make sure the news
is about
the boss and i think he'll pull that off
so if i had to guess no matter who they
say won the debate
as long as pence is solid and i'm sure
he will be
as long as he's solid he wins that's all
he has to do
um yeah he doesn't have to win win he
just has to not
lose hard and he's fine
um kamala never fixed her laugh
well we'll see she hasn't fixed her
laugh
in some videos that we've seen and some
some interviews
but i would expect that in the context
of a
debate she'll probably feel
a little more controlled on her uh her
mannerisms
so i would not expect to see the the
weird cackle
during the debate
um
turn up his microphone yeah and i
also wonder if there'll be any in uh
interrupting
do you think kamala will be interrupting
pence
or the pence will interrupt interrupt
kamala harris
i would expect her to do a little more
interrupting
maybe but maybe there won't be you know
they
they might just both play it straight
all right i've got nothing else for you
so i'm gonna call the game
now so i will talk to you
