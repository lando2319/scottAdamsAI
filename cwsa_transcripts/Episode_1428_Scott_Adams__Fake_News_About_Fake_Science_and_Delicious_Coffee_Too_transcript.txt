hello everybody
and good morning welcome to coffee with
scott adams the best
part of every single day and to make it
even a little bit extra special
not only are we live streaming from the
locals platform at the same time
with an audio de-esser
that's right if you're listening on
youtube and it sounds like i'm a
snake hissing well you wouldn't be
hearing that
so much on locals because i've got that
solved electronically
well all you need today to make this a
special day is a copper bugger glasses
take your chelsea stein a canteen jugger
flask a vessel of any kind
fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now
for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine of the day
the thing that makes everything better
it's called the simultaneous sip
and watch it improve your life now
so i learned something yesterday about
the sound quality on
youtube it turns out that no matter what
equipment you use
or how you broadcast youtube has some
kind of a weird bug
that makes some people's audio low on
some videos
and not on others and apparently it
doesn't matter how you make the video
uh that the problem happens within
youtube so
for all of those saying i can't hear you
your sound is too low
that's your problem with youtube and
not a problem necessarily with the
content although i might
i might do this without a microphone one
of these days
all right um
so you know about that big hacking
attack another it's a 70 million dollar
ransom being asked for presumably
russian hackers
who hacked into a whole bunch of
companies
and i would like to say again
that we're not treating this hacking
stuff seriously
this should be a death sentence
because the the level of destruction
that comes from these hacks
needs to be discouraged at the risk of
death
and at the very least we should consider
a terrorist attack
and at the very least we should be able
to take action in any country we want
so if these guys live in russia
or not putin is uh controlling them
we can take him out we can just drop a
drone right on some russian territory
and just take him out
because we're we're not even serious
about this right now and i don't see why
the hackers would stop
the business model seems pretty good
it's working pretty well
so um i would say we need to get
serious about this and we're not even
close
once again this is probably something
trump would do better because you need
to ratchet up the
the threat you know the response has to
be much bigger than it is
this whole uh oh putin there will be
consequences um will there
will there be any consequences for
russia because of these hacks
no putin will just say i don't know
where they're coming from
and we won't have proof and we won't be
able to go that hard at russia
so that's where president trump could
be a lot better in this situation
on twitter yesterday i asked people in a
little twitter
poll very unscientific if i had ever
changed anybody's opinion on any social
or
political topic and the last i checked
there were about 14
15 000 people had answered the poll and
of my
630 000 followers and
um over half of them who answered
which would be about 8 000 people said
yes
so apparently i've changed just on the
people who answered the poll
more than half of them have changed an
opinion
on something based on on watching this
content
now i'm wondering if that's normal
because i don't know how to judge that
would you say that you know ben shapiro
if you watch his show and he did the
same
poll would would he find that people had
changed their minds because of watching
his content
because his content is terrific right
lots of reasons and facts and
you know good good context and
background and you know
so intellectually ben shapiro would be
superior to mine
i would say certainly on the factual and
context
kind of a basis he's good at that but
does he change minds
uh let me ask in the comments has
ben shapiro ever changed your mind on a
topic
or do you find you agree with him and
all you're doing is just agreeing
i'm going to look at your comments as
they go by um i see a yes
i see a bunch of no's oh i see a bunch
of yeses
okay lots of yeses coming in some no's
interesting okay so i don't know how to
how do we evaluate whether i'm being
persuasive or it's just a
function of talking in public so maybe
if you talk in public and you
you say a lot of things you're going to
change somebody's mind
all right um rasmussen
has a some poll results they asked how
likely is it that the u.s
government spies on critical journalists
and political opponents
now that's a pretty loaded question
isn't it
do you believe that the u.s government
is spying on
critical journalists well the 36 percent
of the
people responded in this rasmussen poll
uh
very likely 36 percent said very likely
36 percent of the public the voting
public
likely voters think that the government
is spying on journalists
what do you think yeah of course they
are
yeah one way or another i mean they
might be spying on them they might be
monitoring them
they might be you know caught in the
indirect monitoring because they may
have communicated with somebody who they
do monitor
a foreign foreign agent now
have i ever talked to somebody from a
foreign
country that our nsa might want to
uh be tracking and the answer is
yes i have i have now i haven't had any
like deep
you know secrets or anything but i have
had
conversations in digital means
with people that in retrospect i could
imagine would be tracked by the nsa
for legitimate reasons you know i didn't
have any like secret
uh you know nothing that i would worry
about anybody knowing about
but doesn't that put me on the list
if i have a conversation in any way with
anybody who is on the monitoring list
don't i get monitored automatically so
i don't know how anybody could disagree
with the the idea that
the government is spying on journalists
i guess you could question the intent
but not the fact that it's happening
it's simply a fact that it's happening
isn't it would anybody disagree with
that statement
that because we know the nsa checks
anybody who's let's say a foreign person
who
might have some importance to us
intelligence wise
don't you think many of them have
contacts with journalists
probably right so yeah
the nsa is probably looking at all them
and then the 23 percent
said it's somewhat likely that the
government is spying on journalists
so you add them together and you get 59
percent
think it's either very likely or
somewhat likely that the government
is spying on journalists
it's not even a story is it
how in the world is that not one of the
biggest stories
in the country but it's not i mean it's
a story
but it just kind of comes goes
um i like your idea
ken all right um
i am fascinated with the topic of how
people assess
risk now i know you don't like it when i
talk about any
coveted stuff because it seems like it's
over for most of you
and i agree with that by the way
personally i feel like the pandemic is
over
for me because i'm not going to take a
long
plane trip in a mask ever again i just
won't do it
and i don't need to wear a mask locally
for anything because i'm
vaccinated you know i suppose if i
visited an old folks home i'd put one on
but um so i'm not so i'm not
too interested in the pandemic stuff
but i'm very interested in how minds
work and so that's that's the element
i'm going at here
and i'm really fascinated with a
specific question
where people are trying to decide
whether to get vaccinated or not
you've got two unknown risks that people
have to balance to make their decision
and they're both completely unknown
one is what is the long-term risk of
getting a vaccination
especially in mrna vaccination the type
of which
is sort of new to the human experience
we have a pretty good idea what the
short-term risks are because the
the trials and also because of the
feedback
but how would you know if there's any
risk five years from now from the
vaccines
and the answer is you wouldn't right so
if you're trying to say what is the
long-term
you know unknown risk of a vaccination
the answer is
who knows nobody there's nobody who can
even estimate it
not with any data but also what is the
long-term risk
of getting this particular virus now if
it were a normal flu virus you'd say to
yourself
well five years from now it's very
unlikely
i'm still gonna have a problem from a
normal flu virus i got five years ago
very unlikely but this is not like a
normal virus right
it's engineered or it looks like it
you know we don't have full confirmation
of that but it appears to be weaponized
can you tell me that the risk five years
from now
from a weaponized virus
is zero i have no idea what the risk is
so you've got a risk from an unknown
virus that's
novel and weaponized in all likelihood
we don't know for sure but it looks like
it and we've got
a vaccine of the type we've never seen
before
pumped into millions of people which one
is the bigger risk
now here's what fascinates me most of
you can make this decision
i don't know how right because it's two
complete unknown
unknowns complete now if you were to
look at the short-term risk
let's let's separate them the short-term
risk of let's say dying
within a two weeks of getting a
vaccination or the short-term risk of
getting coveted and
dying in the hospital how big are those
risks
could you compare them well let me tell
you how i do it
i round them both to zero and then i
ignore them
right because the risk of me dying from
coronavirus
is so close to zero that i would treat
it the same way i treat
driving to the store to buy a loaf of
bread i could die in the car
driving to the store to get a loaf of
bread but it's not part of my decision
making
because it's so close to zero so
while i think the vaccination is really
so close to zero
i can ignore that risk in the short term
and the
risk of dying from the coronavirus in
the short term
so close to zero that i make both of
them non-existent
so if the risk from both of them rounds
to zero
get a vaccination or don't get a
vaccination both
zero risk effectively you know because
it's so small
what do you do well i'll tell you what i
do
i i defaulted toward the decision that
also had about zero risk
because either both of them do but i
picked the one that gave me more freedom
so i feel and of course freedom is
largely a sensation as much as a fact
my sensation is that i'm more free
because apparently i survived the first
few weeks of getting the vaccination
so that that the early risk is behind me
but i can i can go places without a mask
and that means a lot to me so that's how
my decision was made
short term both risks are zero
effectively both are just zero
but one gives me more rights so i took
that one
now the long-term risk still separate
but can't calculate it
nobody can nobody can calculate that
risk
i do however know from personal
anecdotes
several people who have had long-haul
risk with the virus
now i don't know if those long-haul
risks are really permanent
or if they could be but i've heard of
them
right i've heard real people say it's
been months
and i had the virus and i still get
problems
i've never personally heard of anybody
who had a problem with the vaccination
now that's not science right because the
people i've
personally heard of has no statistical
value
but still it's hard to avoid the fact
that i've heard of several people with
virus long-haul problems
and i've heard of nobody that i know
personally
and it's the personal part not news
stories
but nobody personally who's had a
problem with the vaccination
that doesn't mean it's not happening i'm
just saying i'm influenced by
you know my immediate information so
i don't know how you make your decisions
but i round the vaccination
and the virus down to zero risk each
and then i take the one that gives me
the i take the path that gives me more
options so that's where i'm at now
i i stress again that if this sounds
like i'm trying to talk you into getting
vaccinated
no no no no don't don't take that away
from this
because do you see me with my doctor
degree no
no cartoonist do you take
medical advice from cartoonists no
no don't do that don't do that
i'm only interested in the
decision-making process that's it
alright do you do your own medical
decisions
all right let's talk about billionaires
in space
so i love the fact that uh jeff bezos
plans to
take his rocket company uh into space
and he plans to be one of the the first
or the first i guess first crew
among the first in the crew on blue
origins so that's the name of bezos's
uh company and by the way i think he's
stepping down from running
amazon full-time meanwhile virginia
virgin galactic run by richard branson
he's he's decided that he's going to get
into space a little bit earlier
but apparently there's a there's a
dispute about whether that's really in
space
because there's sort of a dividing line
between space
and not in space and i guess the virgin
galactic flight will just be below that
line
whereas the amazon one will be above
that line so
technically bezos will be in space
technically branson will be almost in
space but not quite
so maybe that matters if you're keeping
score
but both of these both of these trips
are deadly
meaning that bezos could die
he could die and it's not the same risk
as driving to the store for a loaf of
bread
i don't know if i put odds on it it's
like 10 isn't it maybe a 10
chance you'll die would you take a
rocket ship
if you had a 10 chance of dying
he's a lot braver than i am maybe that's
why he has
more money than anybody in the world
but and it also makes sense for richard
branson to do this
because branson's brand is adventurism
and taking risks and doing doing sketchy
things
um not sketchy things but dangerous
things and
so it makes sense for branson yeah he's
always been this person but
does it make sense for bezos to risk his
death
going up in space i mean i do like the
fact that he's putting his skin in the
game
that's not nothing i mean that's that's
a lot
but i just don't know if it's the right
play if you're a billionaire
because i have to think his life is
going pretty well so far
why would he take a risk of dying in a
preventable you know accident
preventable in the sense he doesn't need
to be on it
but i guess you'd feel pretty bad if you
send somebody else up there and they
died
so you know maybe maybe you can't just
can't live with the guilt of that if
somebody else died and he wasn't on the
on the ship but we wish him we wish him
luck
and uh what would happen if all of our
billionaires just died in space
you know because you know elon musk is
going to be on one of those rocket ships
eventually right we could wipe out the
entire
like billionaire class in this country
just having them try to fly into space
and not make it
i hope that doesn't happen of course i
wish them all well
but it's fun to watch and it's really
fun
and i i feel as though we're going to
look back on these days
and realize that because these
billionaires were competitive
with each other you know because you had
an elon musk at the same time as a jeff
bezos at the same time as a
sir richard branson the fact that they
all existed
in the same time and space is probably
really important
because don't you think that the
competitive element of that and what
they're learning from each other and
probably
at some point some employees might be
cross-pollinating and stuff
i feel like it's a little bit like the
founder i don't want to say founding
fathers
that's too sexist it's a little like the
founders of the united states
what were the odds that at the same time
in history
you'd have you know monroe and jefferson
and washington
and you know john adams and ben franklin
you know forgetting a few names hamilton
what are the odds
that all of those people would be alive
at the same time
and sort of in the same time and space
and they created the united states
i don't know that any other group of
people could have pulled that off there
was something about
that group of geniuses being in the same
place that made it all happen
and i think we're going to look back on
this space stuff
and say how lucky we were that
three of our most important you know
entrepreneurs were alive at the same
time
and could see each other's work i mean
it's going to be a big deal i think
so cnn is reporting that
it's quite obvious now that climate
change is what's causing
our heat patterns is that true
how many of you would say that is a fact
that science agrees with
is it a fact that the heat wave we're
seeing now
is uh unprecedented and also
clearly because of climate change
uh i'm seeing a lot of no's go by in the
comments
i think the answer is no right i believe
that the
high temperatures have not been much
higher
than they have been historically but
here's the catch i think the winter
temperatures are more mild
so there's a book in an argument
that i can't remember right now let me
tell you the name of the book
because it would be deeply unfair to
refer to this
and not mention the actual book that i
haven't read yet
but
so let me see it this is a
book recommendation this came through
joel pollock
who just read this book by steven coonan
k-o-o-n-i-n it's called
unsettled what climate science tells us
what it doesn't and why it matters so
he's trying to
use the existing data so yeah my
understanding is he
uses the existing databases he's not
making up his own data
and just coming at it at a different
angle and apparently part of the
argument is that the winters are getting
more mild
but the summers are not getting hotter
if that were true
climate change would be more good than
bad
right i don't know if it's true but
that's the claim
so i haven't read that book but i hear
it's good
um but more to the point
isn't it just fake news when cnn reports
well clearly here's climate change
that's fake news right
because the data doesn't indicate it or
doesn't
because what i don't see is a bunch of
climate scientists coming on tv and
okay you can stop mentioning tony heller
i've spent a lot of time interacting
with tony heller
and he is not credible now that doesn't
mean he's wrong about everything he says
but in general he is not credible and if
you're following him
and buying everything he says you're in
deep trouble
don't go down that path i went down i
went down that path pretty
far myself and once i saw
you know the the critics weigh in about
his analyses
it kind of falls apart so um don't go
down the
that path um
so i guess i'm waiting to see some
scientists come on cnn
and tell tell us that the data shows
that something different is happening
now maybe they can
by the way just an update i'm not a
climate change
doubter i am a doubter about how bad it
will be
because i say humans are good at you
know adjusting and correcting
and even the projections are not that
bad
if you really look at the projections of
how much bad is going to happen in the
future
it's actually not that bad it's like a
10
hit on gdp over 80 years which you
literally wouldn't even notice
why don't you be specific about heller
well i'm not going to be
because he's not he doesn't rise to the
level of
conversation meaning there there are
some things that
maybe yes maybe now take take the issue
of ivormectin
ivermectin is one of those things that's
worth discussing
whichever way you go on it worth
discussing
the the tony heller analysis has been
debunked to the point
where it's not worthy of discussion now
if you're not there maybe you need to do
your own research
but don't ask me to go there because it
didn't rise to the level of being worthy
of discussion
it did at one point until i discussed it
to death
and couldn't find a value in it all
right
um so here's a terrible thing that's
about to happen that nobody's talking
about
so you're following the story of uh
shakari
chakri richardson the female sprinter
who got tested positive for marijuana
and is going to be kicked off the 100
is at the 100 meter sprint which is her
best
event now the talk is that because
there's a one month suspension and
there's a difference in timing for the
different events
that it is possible for her to be
on the relay team so i guess the relay
race happens later
and her suspension would be done by then
so the thinking is that although she was
not going to be on the relay team
originally
maybe she could be on the relay team
help them win because she's
the fastest woman in the world
apparently and that would all be good
do you see any problem with that theory
does anybody have a concern
about her being on the relay team
exactly somebody would get booted
from the relay team and here's the
important part
the person who will get booted from the
relay race team
didn't break any rules
right now i'm i'm very
very solidly on the side that says
that she should be allowed to compete
and they should immediately change the
rule
and wipe away this marijuana thing etc
so
i think she should be allowed to compete
period but
whatever mistake was made
was hers right whoever this other person
is
presumably some woman who thinks or who
had a good chance of being on the
the team is going to get bumped off
because somebody else up
come on if you're talking about an
injustice it is an injustice in my
opinion
that somebody who trained all their life
for the the hundred
meters sprint or whatever gets bummed
for marijuana that's a that's a deep
injustice
but you're just screwing some other
athlete if you put her on the relay team
when she wasn't supposed to be there so
this looks worse to me much worse
i mean not even close this is deeply
unfair
because you would literally be punishing
somebody who didn't do anything wrong
so that the person who did something
wrong could compete
there is no way in hell this is okay am
i the only one who has mentioned this so
far
i haven't heard anybody mention it in
public but i imagine
somebody's going to mention it
all right um have you seen today's
dilbert comics that i
that i just it out so
the latest two dilbert comics are on the
subject of
the boss and the dilbert comic hired a
hired a racist just so they'd have
somebody to fire
in case the woke crowds came after them
and then today in the comic
the woke gangs came after them i call
them the wokies
which i think you should adopt the
wokies
the people who are awoke so they come
after dilbert's company and then
here's here's the text of this one in
case you missed it and there's
a point why i'm going to be talking
about this comic i'll get to it
and it goes like this dilbert says to
his boss there's a mob of
woke people surrounding our building
they demand a human sacrifice
and then the boss says fetch the spare
racist i hired for that purpose
and then the last panel you see they're
dangling the the racist out the window
on a pole and the
the alleged racist is saying i'm not a
racist really i'm not
and then from inside the building you
can hear he can't prove that
now regardless of whether you think
that's funny they're
not very funny when they're just spoken
and not read
there is a dilbert effect
which might be important and it goes
like this
in the 90s the early 90s those of you
who were around
remember that business books were huge
it seemed like every day there was a new
business book
with a new great theory about excellence
and passion and
re-engineering and all these things and
and
and the thought was in the early 90s
that if only you read the right book
and use the right systems your your
company would be
you know taken off and very successful
now
almost none of that was true
but it was generally believed to be true
in the early 90s that if
yeah if you just stopped people from
moving your cheese and
used your excellence and all that stuff
everything would be great
do you know what happened to that market
for business books
well that market um happened to coincide
with the rise of dilbert
so dilbert as a comic hit its um his
most
famous stride i would say in the mid to
late 90s
and it destroyed the business book
business because dilbert was the first
um sort of high visibility
mocking of things that people sort of
suspected should be mocked
but they didn't want to be the ones to
do it right you don't want to go first
in case you
you get caught looking foolish but i
never mind going
first and looking foolish so i went
first
the entire market for business books was
destroyed
i think largely because of dilbert
because
you you know for example that elon musk
has a rule for
tesla the rule at tesla is and this is
elon musk's published rule for tesla
that if if there's any kind of a policy
at tesla that they can imagine would end
up in a dilbert comic
don't do it it's a very useful rule
if you think it would end up in a
dilbert comic
don't do it because that's a that's a
pretty good indicator
that this should be mocked and not taken
seriously
so we do know that and i've received
lots of information that
companies have altered their practices
because they either something appeared
in a dilbert comic or they didn't want
it to
because it would be too embarrassing and
when you see wokeness and corporate
wokeness
become a recurring theme in the dilbert
comic
it's probably an indicator of a turning
point
now not necessarily because i'm causing
it although that's not impossible
but more because it's more of a canary
in the coal mine sort of an early
indication
of of a of a transition
and and
i feel as if wokeness may be peaking
does it feel like that to you you know
everything good and everything bad seems
to
you know peak at some point and then
decrease i feel like it's
once it's in a dilbert comic and people
just
laugh and there's nobody reading the
comic and saying
well you know but really the wokeness is
good
nobody's going to read these comics and
say yeah i get that you're making fun of
it but
gosh you know there's a lot of good
stuff here too so don't go too far with
mocking it
that's not happening i think people are
just laughing at it and if you're
laughing at the wokeness
from the wokies it may be the beginning
of the end
so we'll see um
let's talk about all the fake news there
was a story today about a man in
austria who was bitten by a
a five and a quarter foot python
that was in his toilet so the story says
that
this man just sat on his toilet
and a python that had somehow reached
his toilet
through the pipes was in his toilet a
five and a half foot python
and it bit them in the genitals
this story is actually in the news
now put on your fake news
thinking cap is this true
do you really think that an escaped
python
climbed all the all through the pipes
from
some other place climbed through the
pipes
and came out into his toilet and waited
and when he opened the toilet to use it
he didn't notice a five and a quarter
foot
python in his toilet
now imagine you know how thick a python
probably is
now imagine five and a quarter
feet of that wrapped up in a toilet bowl
i have to think that the head was
probably already sitting up above the
level of the toilet
so here's my advice to you if you're
approaching a toilet
and you're about to sit on it if there's
a python head
looking at you from the place you plan
to sit
don't sit on that toilet that's your
advice for today
well i'm going to call this fake news i
do not believe there was a python in a
toilet
no i don't it's an excellent story
but between us
there was no python in a toilet i feel
pretty confident
there was never a python in the toilet
or at least
if there was it didn't get there by
crawling through any pipes
all right here's some more fake news
about fake news did you see the story i
think was yesterday
there was a an executive who used to
work for fox
news who said some bad things about fox
news
it was a big story and then richard
grinnell
points out that this executive from from
fox news
quit in 1997.
so the executive who was in the news for
saying that fox news you know had
problems
left in 1997 and that fact
was not in the stories it took richard
grinnell's tweet
to surface that are you freaking kidding
me
somebody who hasn't worked there since
1997 had a strong opinion
about what it's like there now and
wanted us all to know
is there anything that this person could
add that you
couldn't know yourself just by watching
tv
this is the most fake news
story i've seen
since the python in the toilet
um how about some more
[Applause]
some more news so
true story on the 4th of july
christine who said to me you know if you
were going to murder somebody
a great time to do it would be the 4th
of july because people would think the
gunshots
were just fireworks to which i said
i'm a little bit disturbed at how much
time you put into
murdering people and getting away with
it because i feel like i might be on
that list if you know what i mean
um so aside from the fact that it's
disturbing that my wife is
considering murder and watches every csi
and crime movie
that's ever been made she's become quite
an expert at killing people and getting
away with it
i don't know if she's ever done it but
if she does
she'll get away with it but here's my
point
turns out the cnn is reporting that
over the 4th of july weekend 150 people
were killed by gun violence
and more than 400 shootings
across the country
what on one weekend
on one weekend there were
400 shootings
now i knew gun violence was a problem
did you know is this bad now i don't
know if anybody got shot in my town so
it feels like it didn't
didn't affect me directly but
really 400 shootings
now i ask you how many of this was
because the fireworks were happening how
many of these 150 people who were killed
were killed around the time the
fireworks were going off you know say
nine o'clock at night and after
i feel like there might be people who
are literally taking this
this technique and putting it in
practice and literally killing people on
fourth of july i'm gonna hide on the
fourth of july next year
so britney spears looks like she's going
to be retiring
unless her conservatorship gets
removed because she doesn't want to be
working and just having somebody else be
able to manage the money
which makes perfect sense to me now i
have a few questions
number one we hear in the news today
that her
attorney until 2019 was named
andrew wallet his last name is spelled
exactly like the wallet you have in your
back pocket
that has money here's my advice to you
never hire an attorney whose last name
is
wallet i'm
i'm just saying it's sort of a red flag
right just
don't do it if the name is a wallet
walk away all right so
here's my questions about britney spears
i like that she's starting to play
hardball
because a number of people only get paid
if she works
and she's going to stop working to put
some pressure on the conservative ship
probably a good strategy but let me ask
you this
i know there are always lawyers watching
this let's say
i'm britney spears and let's say i'm
subject to a conservatorship
can i can i go to a promoter
and say hey promoter i'm in a
conservatorship but if you don't mind
and i don't mind can we sign a deal
can can britney spears go sign a deal
with her name on it
to do a performance with somebody who
says yeah and i'll pay you
any way you want to be paid you just
tell me where the money goes
and i'll give it to you and then britney
says for example
oh well i'd like it in crypto can the
conservatorship
get at it because remember
britney did not agree to the
conservatorship
she's just a citizen can that citizen
make a private deal with another citizen
i'm seeing fred say her signature has no
standing
but does that matter if the other person
respects it so i hear what you're saying
and i don't know if that's legally true
but let's let's take the assumption that
she's not allowed to do business deals
because she's under a conservatorship
which feels like that's probably true
right
but that only matters if the person she
makes the deal with
recognizes the conservatorship and
respects it
so say she goes to somebody says look
you know
i want to beat this conservatorship how
about you and i do a deal
my signature won't mean anything but
yours does
so you're going to sign something that
says you'll pay me if i perform
i'll perform you pay wherever i tell you
to pay me in this case i'm going to say
send crypto to my wallet
what happens if the conservative ship
says hey
whitney hey brittany that crypto money
belongs in the conservative ship and
brittany says yes it does it totally
does
good luck with that because you don't
know my wallet
and you can't get at it
what would happen
i don't know all right let me give you
another um
another one let's say a let's say
britney teams up with somebody she can
trust
i'm going to put myself in the story
just because it is a third party
so let's say brittany says scott i trust
you
but i don't trust my conservatorship so
here's the thing
why don't you make a deal with the venue
that i'm going to perform at
and they will pay you i'll perform
because nobody can stop me from driving
places and performing
so i'll perform and i won't even sign a
contract they'll just give the money to
you
i will trust you to give that money to
me in some fashion
is that legal could she do that
that's a straw man yeah and it would be
you know quite explicitly to beat the
conservatorship
but would it work uh how much power does
the conservative ship have to
to claw back things that maybe get out
of their bounds
the conservatorship would sue
interesting that sounds right i don't
know if it's right but
if the conservative ship sued her
but would that work what if they what if
they sued her and won
and they said yeah you got to give us
this crypto and then she just doesn't
what would happen
yeah so these are the questions at the
very least she could
push the question let me tell you what i
would do
if i if i were brittany i would put
every kind of pressure on the system
that i could
i would try to break it i'd try to go
around it
i would try to get allies i would hire
lawyers through the
sort of the wazoo i mean i would just
attack it from every single angle
in every possible way and i would try to
beat it
and challenge them to unbeat it in other
words
in other words i would find a way to get
the money directly or indirectly
and then i would challenge them to get
it away from me make them work for it
because especially uh especially if
they get some kind of a co-conservative
ship and it's not just their dad
i don't know how hard anybody's gonna
work to get that money
would the co-conservative sewer
let let's say the uh apparently the
professional conservators
quit so i think at this point it's only
your dad
but if she had succeeded in having a
co-conservatorship
with professionals do you think those
professionals
would have sued brittany for making a
side deal and making some money
i don't think so they might quit
but i don't think they would sue her for
trying to beat the conservatorship
that even they don't think is uh valid
because they quit right i would push
everything i i would i would pull out
all the stops
if i were brittany i would i would
destroy i would just
lay waste to everything and everybody
i wouldn't take any prisoners right i
would go on
full full offense and i would not stop i
would destroy the lives of anybody who
was keeping me in the conservatorship
let me say that again i would destroy
the lives
of anybody who kept me in a
conservatorship under those conditions
the same same conditions that brittany's
under i would destroy
anybody i would be hiring people to you
know dig
into their lives whatever's legal i mean
i wouldn't do anything illegal
but oh my god i would go hard at those
people
i would i would make her father live the
rest of his
 life in court i would just sue
him for everything
i would just start making up stuff and
say okay i'm going to sue you for this
i'm going to see you for this i'm going
to see you for this sue you for this
i would just sue the out of him
every goddamn day
sorry i know you don't like that phrase
and she would have the whole world on
her side
i mean the whole world is on her side
she needs to put the pressure on
and so we're backing her completely i
think
another fake news the there was a story
that the u.s
women's soccer team turned their back on
some veteran who is playing the
harmonica for the
pledge of not the pledge of allegiance
the national anthem
but it's fake news there is video of
the teammates some facing one way and
some facing the other
but some of them had turned to face a
flag
and some of them didn't know and it had
nothing to do with
the guy with the harmonica so that's
just fake news fake news
um and that
is your live stream for today probably
the best one you've ever seen
in your whole life we do need to get
back to some really good stories because
it seems the summer is not when the good
stuff happens
um
here's a question have you considered
reading listening to norm mcdonald's
wonderful novel well i've been asked
that a number of times
now i'm a huge norm mcdonald fan
uh i watch all of his youtube clips
probably at least once a week i watch a
bunch of norm mcdonald clips
so i would imagine that his book is very
good but i haven't
haven't read it
um dilbert represents illustrates the
kafka trap
yeah we've been hearing a lot about that
lately i forget what it is though
have weinstein on please
i know why you're asking but
it wouldn't give you what you want and
i've said this before
the problem with the world is
one expert talking on tv or a podcast
that's not the solution it's the problem
so i'm not going to be part of the
problem by bringing on the one expert
and then you hear what they say it
doesn't have to be an expert it could be
just funded whatever
and then you don't have a counterpoint
that's useless
it would make things worse not better
now
if i could host some kind of content
where there were people on opposing
sides
and i didn't have a time limit and i i
could interrupt them and say hey what
about this and
you didn't answer that question and you
know how about this data
if i could do that then any topic where
there's controversy would be great
in fact i'd love to do that i need a
little better
technology set up to be able to do that
so sometime soon i think
i can
um yeah it would be awesome
and i would be pretty good at it if i do
say so myself
uh that used to be a tv show did it
i don't remember a tv show like that
um weinstein spent some time i'm
reading the locals comment here on this
podcast last week
talking about scott oh i didn't know
that
i hope it was in a useful way
jerry springer
why is your audio so good today well as
i
said earlier um the audio is random
on youtube so i'm using the
same setup that i know works but some
people will experience
low audio and some people won't and has
nothing to do with what i'm doing
apparently it's a youtube bug of some
sort
um no i've i threw away the so the
device that required batteries
i will never use again because
i was testing it but i knew right away
that if it required batteries i was
going to run into trouble
and i did so that technology is
dead to me it would be good technology
if you're just
practicing and recording because then if
you have a bad battery it's not the
worst
thing in the world but you can't do a
live stream and depend on your batteries
all right i love locals broadcast in the
background
do you hold the same animosity toward
police unions as you do
toward teachers unions um
no because they're different
so the question is do i rail against
police unions the same as i railed
against teachers unions
well here's the difference the the
police unions have some issues right
they're protecting
police and maybe over protecting them
but it is sort of their job they are
they are a counter balance
against you know uh management abusing
the employees
so you know it's it's a productive kind
of a
tension i would say but i don't see the
police
being a gigantic problem in general
they're definitely police abuses and
maybe the
police unions are making it a little
easier for that to happen in a variety
of ways
that could be an argument but when you
look at the
teachers unions they're destroying
generations of kids
and they're the biggest form of
institutional
racism period by far not even close to
anything else
so the teachers unions are destroying
civilization
the police unions are maybe protecting
some bad cops
sometimes in some situations those are
not comparable
one is destroying civilization
and one gets a few people killed that is
tragic
but it's not a civilization ending
problem
um have i seen the john hopkins war game
no i haven't
all right um that's it for youtube i'm
going to talk to the locals crowd for a
little bit before i go
and i will see you youtubers tomorrow
